Many of my clients had tx stuck due to some wallets with default tx fee that is no longer enough. That's more real, frustrating and powerful fud wise that any blog or Reddit post...

Tonight EST?? So today UTC is scrapped then? please can you confirm this?
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:31:41
But did the hacker really need bitgo to sign anything? If the hacker had 2 of 3 keys he could sign transactions himself without bitgo intervention.
@_date: 2016-08-26 10:27:23
Nah you are just using bigot rhetoric to discredit people with different opinions.

Actually ETC is the only one that retains the original ETH qualities the only one with consistent rules unlike ETHBailout.

I'm not sure what are you complaining about. Yes, water is wet and if you want to take a bath you'll get wet. If you need a service bound by regulations you'll have to comply if you don't need it good for you, in any case your complaints are pointless in this thread.

He has already given a lot of btc and destroyed more btc he started by destroying 10BTC by sending them to the bitcoin eater address, so yeah he is going to give away a big chunk of it. In fact those are tainted coins and by giving them away to users (and to himself) he makes it really difficult to blockchain analysis companies to figure who he is.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:50:39
If they have 2of3 keys they can broadcast limitless transactions directly to the bitcoin network, no limit could be enforced in this case.
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:53:55
This is in fact impossible to do without counterparty risk.
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:37:29
First of all, buying doesn't mean keeping.
We are traders, I have 36% of my funds locked in this shitcoin that I can't even withdraw so I might as well do what I do best: trade. I sold at 0.41 and just rebought way lower increasing the amount bitfinex owes me, you can even make everything you lost back in USD or BTC or lose even more more of course.
This place is full of high risk speculators so it shouldn't surprise you that people in a forced long BFX are now speculating.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:33:23
Have you considered the possibility that "processing" means the money is still in the account until the withdrawal is "completed" even if the balance in the UI is updated?
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:26:20
Zane very clearly said it was "on us" this is bullshit and there is no reason to believe anything you said.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:56:59
Actually if they go bankrupt that it's exactly what will happen, all assets liquidated including yours to haircut every creditor including you, that's why they finally chose this route it's what more closely resembles what a legal scenario may look like. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:23:04
Under what jurisdiction?
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:46:26
The fact that BTC was segregated is irrelevant, a technicality, because the ONLY important factor is who has the PVT KEY of said wallets that's what defines the ownsership of the coins. If they held the private key they are responsible for your funds, if they lose your funds because they fucked up as they have admitted then they are not blaming you. The fact that they kept the BTC that only they had control over in segregated wallets instead of cold storage+database entries is, again, an internal accounting technicality that has nothing to do with responsibility in the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:45:58
They are describing how the structure of their wallets work internally with segregated BTC per user, it has nothing to do with blaming users they have specifically said that neither users accounts nor Bitgo were compromised, and that the hack is "on us" how is that blaming customers? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:15:46
How is that? No USD was hacked nor any other crypto. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:45:26
lol yeah I guess being quick to anger is more telling than the cryptographic proof he was unable to provide...
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:41:52
Zane said they didn't, that they just stopped signing transactions they didn't move coins around or sweep addresses.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:40:32
If its you, you did probably destroy some lives, at least don't mock us...
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:54:04
The only ones paying for the mistakes of a few are the ones that voluntarily chose to put their money on the hands of those few people running the exchange in the first place, it's just people that took a risk paying for it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:34:31
No. He said that they don't yet know how they'll handle losses so you can expect socialized losses, nothing inside the exchange is safe ATM.

Do you realize how stupid and actually selfish going after their "Achilles heal" is right now? They already allowed withdrawals and their bfx token is already trading, forcing them to close now that most people have withdraw achieves absolutely nothing it only hurts the people that were unable to withdraw like US users with frozen bitgo accounts. Now that most people withdrew their funds you won't get back your 36% regardless of what a judge says in 5 years they simply can't cover anything with the funds remaining. Please think of the people that haven't been able to withdraw yet, they don't deserve to pay for your stupidity with their full accounts, it's just not fair.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:14:38
You are right that some questions are pointless right now yet it's human to keep asking when so many people lives are about to be turned upside down (mine included).
Fortunately I haven't seen many feces flung in Zanes direction actually, in fact there are many posts thanking him for his responsiveness in this shitstorm and I take this opportunity to thank him again.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:42:47
No wait, they don't need ads they can do whatever they want anyway yay!
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:04:55
The fact that you decided to take a stroll in the bad neighborhood and you understood the risks, doesn't mean you should actually THANK the mugger that stole from you with a knife to your throat because he didn't kill you.

Price drop? It's not about the price those 70 million stolen from the most popular exchange were the lifesavings of many many people, it has little to do with price.

Incompetence might not be dishonesty, but this courier opened my package that didn't got stolen and took some of my money from inside to pay some of his other customers without my consent, pretty dishonest if you ask me.

So are we still on track for an announcement today UTC time? Will subscribers to the statuspage.io be notified when the announcement is online?
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:24:53
I plan of withdrawing my remaining 64% of capital as soon as possible before some dumbass throws them into a MT GOX style lock down where no one gets nothing for years. That's not the logic of a battered wife, that's the logic of any sane person, after my withdrawal has been processed you can do whatever the fuck you want.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:52:36
Torpedo the proposal? The moment they allowed withdrawals and trading of the BFX token the proposal was set in stone, there's nothing left to torpedo not even a judge can change their decision or the 36% cut now that everyone has withdraw and there's nothing left to redistribute. The only ones getting fucked over if a judge steps in are the people with frozen accounts that haven't been able to withdraw yet.
@_date: 2016-08-14 05:17:51
I just received my withdrawal, ETH and BTC, except for the bitgo US users, the truth is that withdrawals keep working flawlessly (with the logical delay at first).
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:00:54
Steal my BFX via margin calls? It's the user the one that decides to open margin positions with BFX collateral no one is forcing users to do this, is the user responsibility to know what he is doing and assume the consequences of his bad decisions.
@_date: 2016-08-24 05:56:38
That's no excuse for bad trading if you think whales control the market either GTFO or add that factor to your trading model.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:58:54
What exactly did you tell her? Because you still don't know how much is lost there's a chance you can recover at least half of your funds.
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:47:34
Yes, I place myself in your shoes and it really fucking sucks, I had a lot in bitfinex and these past days have been a nightmare so I understand the anxiety you're feeling and I hope they solve your issue. But aside from the issue with bitgo wallets they keep processing all withdrawals which I think is a good sign. Good luck.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:56:15
Only if the only method for repayment is coming for operating profits, not external investors etc.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:40:21
Let me break this to you. They already allowed withdrawals and trading of the BFX token so people withdrew their funds and the 36% haircut is set in stone now, no judge can force them to reduce it with funds they no longer have, going after them now achieves nothing in that regard the only thing you can accomplish is fucking over people with frozen accounts due to the bitgo problem that haven't been able to withdraw yet, they don't deserve to lose everything now that everyone has been able to withdraw just because some fucktard doesn't understand he is not getting his 36% back no matter what if they get shut down.
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:21:16
At $0.38 per shitcoin only 62% of BFX is imaginary currently.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:09:25
We are thanking Zane (not bitfinex) for his work as a community manager hes not even involved in technical roles in the exchange, and that community management has been responsive which is very important and rare in a situation like this.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:54:18
If he only hacked that amount from which bitfinex could recover no problem he wouldn't have any leverage to negotiate. By hacking a potentially fatal amount of coins he now has bitfinex in a desperate situation.
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:31:40
Bitfinex has denied those are their coins.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:58:12
Is it correct to assume that you share that information because it's relevant? I mean if 99.99% of the funds were stolen you could still say not all funds were stolen but that will be irrelevant. So is it relevant?
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:14:55
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:07:53
Not really, this is a massive hit for a LOT of people myself included obviously some of us will cone to Reddit to share our grief.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:39:31
They already said they didn't. That they only stopped signing transactions they didn't sweep or moved funds around.
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:40:53


Regardless of what the user interface showed you about your balance, the money was still in your account while being processed, it was not being wired (otherwise it would have arrived) and it wasn't in your bank either so it was in fact waiting to be processed inside your account (regardless of the UI) and that is the reason why you are here.
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:45:57
Yes, the hard part is getting other to embrace a change because even if its for the better it means risks, so if you hold the passive majority hostage then you are golden! you can do whatever the fuck you want anyway yay!
@_date: 2016-08-20 06:07:34
Bitcoin is neither cash nor considered even a currency AML wise in many jurisdictions. And cash itself is completely anonymous anyway...
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:32:35
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:16:35
No, you shouldn't. Coinbase is perfectly fine and easy to use to buy bitcoin despite some FUD you might see here because some people dislike it's CEO. Just remember to learn how to use a wallet and withdraw your bitcoins to your wallet as soon as you buy them. Remember you don't really own bitcoins unless you have them in your own wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:39:46
I'm not sure what part didn't you understand about tokenizing the debt using the blockchain.
IOUs can be issued without a blockchain, yes, which turns into a complete clusterfuck to trade them across jurisdictions using lawyers, legal fees and intermediaries. With a blockchain based IOU I can trade them instantly and securely with anyone in the world with no intermediary whatsoever and for free.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:40:01
If they had the keys they could broadcast transactions directly to the bitcoin network no limit could be implemented because the hackers would be dealing directly with the bitcoin blockchain not with bitgo or its software.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:31:46
Nothing inside that exchange is safe since they will probably socialize the losses between all their customers regardless of the fact that only BTC was stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:21:20
Do you even math? They owe 120k, you'll get more selling your tokens and withdrawing than waiting 5 years for a judge to redistribute 50k between the people they owe 120k.
@_date: 2016-08-23 13:35:00
Bitgo signed with their key because bitfinex told them to do so. Having one key and the ability to sign with a second key (via telling a third party to do so) equals having both keys in practical terms.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:35:53
Probably that, they'll liquidate their assets including your recent deposit.
@_date: 2016-08-12 05:41:02
You rush too much to call people stupid. This is nothing like Gox, there's the haircut but the exchange reopened and they are processing a shit-ton of withdrawals and being responsive, people are getting more that 64% out which is better than what everyone was expecting when the 120k BTC figure was made public, for some people the BFX tokens fit their enough risk-reward ratio to throw some money which is legitimate and not stupid at all if done with your high risk funds.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:22:27
Nothing to see here. This only refers to the BFX token, they already said that US traders wouldn't have full functionality regarding the token.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:25:45
You are completely delusional they lost $70 million how on earth do you expect to get 100% back if they go out of business?
@_date: 2016-08-26 09:46:42
Giving up on competing and wasting your head start is bad for you though.
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:03:30
The odds of the company being forced into liquidation by lawsuits is big enough to take your remaining funds and GTFO before that happens.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:32:27
That's better. Regardless, even if you can theoretically mix 1k coins having in mind that bitmixer.io the most popular mixer has only 2k coins in their pool, it doesn't look like you'll end up mixing your coins much.
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:17:15
No repercussions? We will see about that.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:25:09
Oh no.
What percentage of customers funds is that?
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:47:56
If you don't know how can you say which such certainty that it won't be 63% ??? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:34:17
More like the hacker had the 2 finex pvt keys so he was able to sign transactions to transfer funds out and there was nothing bitgo could do.
@_date: 2016-08-26 09:18:59
The only thing that hits the clipboard are unsigned and signed transactions respectively, no pvt keys.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:01:10
Lazy? It's not about laziness is about pragmatism. I was able to withdraw 72% of my funds, less than a week after a 70million dollar hack, thanks god. Not even the most optimist unrealistic legal scenarios comes close to this you don't have to be Einstein to see it.
Suing them after they allowed withdrawals now that there isn't anything left to redistribute achieves nothing it only hurts people with frozen accounts that weren't able to withdraw.
If you are going to do something stupid like throwing away your money going after an empty carcass of a company knowing you'll achieve nothing, at least have the decency to wait for people with frozen accounts to be able to withdraw like the rest of us.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:18:28
They haven't decided yet how to handle the losses.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:27:47
Isn't buying BFX Tokens from affected users actually crowdfunding?
@_date: 2016-08-09 13:23:35
2 hours??
What the hell? why don't you commit to a specific time so that your already stressed users have at least time to get ready?
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:43:40
Zane has already said they are not covered by bitgo insurance.
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:27:56
what happens with the BFX tokens if you find an investor that covers loses? Am I delusional and this possibility is 100% discarded? will details about this scenario be shared in the next announcement explaining how the tokens will work?
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:08:26
Minority? I'm sorry what metrics are you using to determine that only a minority of bitcoin users want lower fees while not compromising decentralization with conservative 2mb blocks? like do you have any numbers to back up your claim?
As for the suggestion to leave bitcoin if the AXA sponsored devs have new incentives that I find dubious, call me crazy but I'm of the opinion that I should fight for what I care instead of just giving up. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 06:28:11
Yeah and demand and supply are directly related to how well the protocol and the actors that support it and put it to work (miners, devs, node operators) understand each other and are on the same page.
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:37:30
You say that as if there was any difference between your bitaddress.org paperwallet and the tezor seed which is in fact also a paperwallet completely unaffected by server downtime. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:18:49
You don't get to trade your BFX shit coins for equity, only accredited investors get to do that (half a million € capital and 1 year professional experience in the finance sector for EU investors) but if there's interest from this investors it should reflect on the price of the shitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:30:23
In about 50 hours the funds that havent been spent and remain at that address will self destruct (automatically sending them to a non working btc address).

@_date: 2016-08-10 11:27:01
What? regardless if the counterparty refuses to honor them or not, or how shitty they are.
Trading those IOUs across continents is a clusterfuck on itself without a blockchain, because without a blockchain you need lawyers, notaries and to waste all sorts of resources on verifying that the piece of paper that the gave you isn't falsified. With a blockchain based token you just have to check on a block explorer, period.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:24:25
What does "we'll have to see how things come along" mean in this context? That maybe the announcement will be delayed?

I've been using it forever since I haven't found a shared send alternative for free and **casual** privacy. Also I haven't found a web wallet replacement with the same amount of options you have on the custom send tab of blockchain.info

I'm with you. This is terrifying for a lot of us god help us. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 09:15:29
If the pvt keys are generated and stored locally how is that web wallet any different to any local SPV wallet? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:29:55
Very interesting thanks for the information. Bitgo users were claiming that their wallet logs showed the withdrawals as being performed by "admin which I guess makes sense then.
@_date: 2016-04-08 07:15:19
You don't know how dictatorships work do you? 
@_date: 2016-08-12 08:27:09
What are your thoughts on a truck load of lawsuits going their way? I also think their plan might work and I baghold 5 figures in BFX tokens myself, but this is completely uncharted territory legally and it's impossible to know if a judge may freeze everything in the end. That's what I'm more concerned about.
@_date: 2016-04-29 11:56:05
You are completely free to ignore those bitcoin companies, so again, they are not a trojan horse to the network. And by the way many of us DO need them and benefit greatly for their service, thanks to them I'm able to do a lot of useful things with my bitcoins, if p2p alternatives like Bitsquare work, then perfect, meanwhile I'll keep using my bitcoins via useful fiat bridges if I need to. It's just choice, and choice is good.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:33:29
That's some bullshit utopia. There are vast cultural discrepancies between countries and in fact the countries that have something resembling a true democracy are a minority. Nothing good can come of exposing the decent democracy I have in my tiny European country to the morons that passed the Georgia legislation or that vote for trump, or the medieval laws from some parts of the middle east etc etc.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:24:10
So we shouldn't expect any info regarding how you will handle customer loses in the upcoming announcement then?
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:16:51
No one is forcing us to sell our BFX, but many sold because they are very stressed by the fuck up of bitfinex it'll be highly immoral for Bitfinex to buy their tokens pennies on the dollar exploiting how desperate bitfinex mistakes has made their users.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:04:51
If they can repurchase from you at nominal value the moment it appreciates, how are you supposed to make any profit?
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:41:29
Or how a market for gox coins developed where people were able to dump gox coins at a massive discount but at least get something and the counterparty was taking the risk in hopes of a big return if gox recovered.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:19:43
They do allow you to trade if you reside in the US and they are not illegal in the eyes of the CFTC who not only didn't shut them down but fined them and forced them to comply with certain requirements which they did and was enough to make the CFTC happy.
The only functionality not available in the US is margin trading, trading itself is perfectly fine, and the message displayed only relates to the BFX token (a complex debt backed token) something they did state from the very beginning after announcing the token.
Just to clarify.
@_date: 2016-04-24 06:51:34
I never understood this type of ramblings, when I use my bitcoin debit card I'm actually exchanging my precious bitcoins not for fiat (temporary vector) but for food rent etc because life you know? That's the reason to earn bitcoin in the first place for me, bitcoin is at my service not the other way around, you talk about fiat slavery yet ironically you sound like Gollum with his ring when you speak about bitcoin.
I can't use bitcoin directly to buy  anything in my life so if my debit card broke the bitcoins in my wallet are equally useless to buy milk you know?
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:23:40
So I just need an efficient, simple, robust and lightweight bitcoin wallet like Mycelium used to be, what happens with users like me?, will all this new features make the wallet more complex (more security risks) for people that don't need them? Will there be a light version without all this clutter or is the new wallet designed so that all this features don't get on the way if you just want a bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:06:02
It's not a chicken egg thing, it's a competition. BCH is supported by more exchanges, more payment processors, has more liquidity and more trading volume and it's easier to use for bitcoiners hence it has an obvious advantage over those alts you mention.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:58:40
Wrong they don't need access to your machine. Your BTC can be stolen by a malicious website just by visiting that website while electrum it's open in the background.

Pro tip. If you want to prove ownership of an address don't sign some bullshit generic message that proves nothing because anyone could have signed that (Dr Craig knows about this).
Sign something like this instead: *"is the owner of this address &lt;timestamp&gt;"*
You are welcome.
@_date: 2016-04-24 08:53:49
What part didn't you understad? I keep my wealth in bitcoin for all the advantages it has over fiat, and I spend it anywhere I want thanks to the awesome service that bitcoin debit cards provide. I don't hold fiat at any time it's just a vector while performing the transaction, my wealth stays in BTC in my wallet. Do you get it now?

The segwit adoption fiasco tells an undeniable truth about what adoption you can expect for complicated opt in tech that requires opening channels and learning new things vs sending old familiar on chain tx for a 0.00005 fee, and I do find bitcoin cash development/fundamentals weak but now that I'm forced to use it to transfer between exchanges etc I don't see the incentive to bother with lightning just to save half a cent per TX tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:29:19
Not even as a store of value unless that value is a lot and you don't intend to move it for years. Because moving, mixing, or spending some of that value it's crazy expensive compared with other cryptos.

Segwit not only didn't provide a 2x blocksize increase it did lower bitcoin dominance from 86 to 40% in one year, forcing users to use complicated opt in tech by making the chain crazy expensive will actually push users away instead of making them use your complicated tech. Alts are more popular than ever before this is a dangerous game core is playing.
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:17:28
Except when they don't have an incentive to do so. People can learn quickly about cheaper segwit tx but they are not bothering, since they have a lot of cheaper easier alternatives including some very simple and familiar like BCH the question is of it realistic to expect them to bother learning lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:56:28
This is absolutely WRONG. Every single user WITH a password is completely affected by this issue. If you have a password on electrum just by visiting a website that website can download your xpub key via JavaScript using the unprotected RPC method via CORS, not only your xpub key with all your addresses and all you balance but they can also modify the address you want to send to and control and modify any single setting of electrum remotely just not the private keys, so the password protects your private keys and your BTC from being stolen directly but the vulnerability is still HUGE even if you use a password.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:11:12
This is just pathetic. I know I'll get downvotes but I've been a hodler for more than 4 years and pretending that yelling at your users or coinbase is the way to scale is absurd. Maybe we have to finally admit that segwit is not in fact a 2x blocksize increase like people were saying during the scaling wars because that's the theoretical maximum assuming users bother to use it which they don't. Maybe a time has come to consider that complicated opt in tech may have way lower penetration than expected lightning included. Maybe a time has come to admit that a core sponsored mandatory blocksize increase in 2018 is not only feasible but necessary while bitcoin continues to slip from 87% dominance to 30% in just one year.

The only disingenuous thing here is pretending the abysmal 10% adoption segwit has is helping with anything. 
I've been a hodler for 4 years you can't teach me how to play this game I'm afraid, and your childish altcoin insults are a waste of time. I hope some day people like you will stop burying their heads in the sand and develop some critical thinking of their own. THAT might actually help.

Yeah not even devs are bothering with segwit it seems. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:04:42
Yeah except bitcoin went from 86% market cap dominance to less than 40% in one fucking year, the reason why no one is using segwit is because they don't have to, they have cheaper working alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:33:34
Segwit isn't even helping because no one bothers to uour it unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:32:46


Not really because unless people use it since it's opt-in it's effectively a 0 blocksize increase with potential to be a 1.7x **IF** everyone bothers to use it, something that seems very unlikely seeing the current adoption rate.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:21:04
I didn't say neither of those things. But yeah from  the perspective of IT on a bitcoin business (exchange or whatever) it's extremely easy to install just a core update that supports bigger blocks (the hardfork itself it's not your responsibility) than having to change and update each and every single deposit address for all your costumers and educate them, cold and hot storage and then having to deal with the increase in support tickets from people that don't know what is a belch32 address and why their legacy doesn't recognize their deposit addresses etc.

Neither dogecoin nor LTC have the trading volume, liquidity and exchange support that BCH already has including support by bitpay and Coinbase (BTC - BCH conversions included) I do agree about the weak development and miner centralization problems etc but it already has a significant advantage over any other altcoin and outs also simple and familiar to bitcoiners to use and since even if it's a success many people won't use it no matter what maybe it's bandaid approach will work longer than people expect.

I'm so glad to see that a post like this could make it in this subreddit. It's so obvious, now that there's no more forks looming it's the perfect time for a blocksize increase and that will suck air from BCH also. It's 2018 we can afford bigger blocks.

Nah not really. This isn't a stock, you had your own eyes to see what's going on with the mempool and all major businesses adding bitcoin cash and it's (temporary?) competing advantages. Bitpay also added support. By the way someone found they Coinbase was adding bitcoin cash before the announcement because they saw it via the API forcing them to announce it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:58

Since the amount of cryptos that can exist is infinite they can totally tackle that volume between all the ones that are not yet overloaded plus DAG based distributed ledgers might end up working in the future. One thing is for sure complicated opt in tech like the lightning network will surely disappoint like segwit adoption has.

I actually used to use the bitcoin network back when it was possible to do so (loading my debit card and spending some BTC) I'm not jumping ship entirely it's just that low fees are more convenient to us users of the network. I get hodlers don't care about usability but people who want to use the network do.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:45:48
Nah not really. I get the hate but at this point it has more speculators than anything, with the current bitcoin fees it's an interesting hedge not to mention it's being added to bitpay. I don't think you can sustain such a price with just PnDers or liars.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:29:43
16 of those 21 million coins have already been distributed mining is still profitable because there are 5 million left to be mined and also miners collect transfer fees (quite profitable nowadays). Keep in mind that bitcoin is divisible by 100 million units, so there's really no need to homogeneous smaller less secure alternatives. You can just use smaller fractions.
When I say mining its profitable I mean for big ass miners with datacenters and cheap electricity of course.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:07:58
I want bitcoin to succeed but I see a lot of problems with this complacent views in this highly competitive market:


Thanks to sobre fundamentals that are no longer working like the ability to use the chain, this isn't written in stone it's based on usability and momentum which we are losing. Bitcoin had 87% crypto dominance 12 months ago now it's 40% ignore this at your own risk.


As compared to what? It's the gateway to crypto seeing how is losing market dominance people are not staying.


They also have that for ether and specially bitcoin cash unlike segwit and lighting which are complex and require training and a shit load of engineering hours.


See previous point about why improving bitcoin protocol to support complex tech isn't easier than keep using their already implemented ether or bcash infrastructure.

You connect to the rest of the bitcoin network and to the rest of miners, it's a peer 2 peer network. Mining is a collective and competitive effort, once you find the solution you broadcast it to the network and the rest of the people of the network acknowledges it if it's correct and moves on to the next block and you collect the reward.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:42
I get it's easier to have someone or something to vent and blame for everything, but what are your thoughts on the current situation with fees and the fact that segwit was sold as a 2x capacity increase and it has terrible adoption and is contributing nothing to the fact that TX cost close to $100 bucks?

It was different with just a couple of decent exchanges one of which was Mt Gox way less media coverage and exposure also it was faster. Also the run up was fueled by the Willy bot on a single exchange (mt gox) not by actual new influx of users. Now we have reliable exchanges scattered around the world, big volumes, big new influx of users and good coverage. I still think this can get nasty and that most new users are not used to the panic and violent moves bitcoin can deliver so we will see what happens if we start a decent correction.

I find it dubious when a company is split between tax havens and different jurisdictions instead of being FDIC insured (or local equivalent) and incorporated in a single country where you know where to sue and the consumer protection that applies in case shit happens. I understand that it's legal and legitimate to operate the way you do though.


In 2012 the CFTC regulations regarding swaps were very clear, bitfinex kept using the wrong term for years, only when your customers started receiving letters from the CFTC did your company addressed the fears of their customers and changed it.


I was talking about USD balance not bitcoin. You do allow unverified customers to have a USD balance on your platform so long as they convert it to btc to deposit/withdraw.


The funds used by margin traders being thrown into positions against their will are those of the lenders like OP that have margin funding offers, when the platform that lends your funds glitches hard this of course affects lenders. I didn't even mentioned the time when your CDN glitched and people were able to see the balance of other users accounts.
All that being said, this is just my personal due diligence and as a user of your platform I value your responsiveness Zane.

This is a very immature and easily manipulated market. The job of the SEC is to act as a nanny for clueless investors and to protect them from this kind of bullshit.

@_date: 2015-12-04 10:06:01
It's very risky. And that risk is priced in.
They operate from Hong Kong and the company is in Seychelles (or something like that) under a dubious legal framework specially the lending part. The are under the CFTC radar so they changed the term swap to margin funding in a hurry recently.
They don't require ID if you enter or exit their platform using crypto so anyone can park hundreds of thousands of dollars of dubious origin there and I'm sure that acting like a bank without KYC/AML is against many laws in other countries.
Your money is at risk during flash crashes were borrowers collateral can't cover the losses (this is common on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges) they admittedly have lower leverage and they take a cut for some sort of insurance fund, of course they refuse to share the numbers and what it could really cover in case of a margin cascade. Their margin platform glitched heavily recently causing traders to be thrown into unwanted positions when they tried to exit the market due to UI lag, this was extremely concerning and they lost many customers.
Also your numbers are wrong since traders are constantly closing their positions and your funds stay idle not earning interest a lot of the time even with autolending, you've to constantly log in to lend manually.
I use their platform, but I'm very aware of the risks involved and obviously only use money I can afford to lose and I don't think parking money there to lend (your money is locked out while lent and you can't withdraw even if shit happens) is worth the risk.

I think the stagnation we're facing comes from this, scalability only concerns Bitcoin medium to advanced users.

Block size should be adjusted depending on the size of blocks needed for the amount of transactions the network is handling in a specific time frame, not by a completely unrelated factor like the amount of miners joining the network.

Who would flame you here for shitting on Ver and posting conspiracy theories that include click farms and coordinated dumping the evil Coinbase and even spam attacks. You are safe here.
Unfortunately you didn't mention the fact that spamming the network is irrelevant since what drives the price of fees up isn't the number of cheap transactions in the mempool but the bidding fee war desperate users have to pay to move their coin. You can't spam at $100 buck per TX. You also forgot to mention in your analysis the abysmal segwit adoption (remember when we were told it was a 2x blocksize increase) and no lightning network in sight.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:50:37

I do agree with everything else but the fact that bitcoin is the tits and isn't broken doesn't mean it should cost 20k a piece it's a wild speculative investment and there's nothing wrong with risk management.

This is something I can't wrap my head around I'm not a Bitcoin Cash hater and I understand why someone like Ver &amp; co will want to try bitcoin without the blocksize spam limit its just a different technical approach and in my book they are free to do so since bitcoin is open source. But partnering with this fucking clown (?) Is completely counterintuitive It completely undermines his credibility and that of the project it looks almost like an inside Job to discredit bitcoin cash.

So many of my preferred vendors that accept BTC already abide by the KYC/AML regulations of the country where they're incorporated. I have to undergo KYC/AML to deposit Bitcoin on Kraken for example. So having LN doesn't change that but it allows me to have instant transactions that scale without bloating the blockchain to the vendors that already required KYC with Bitcoin anyway while at the same time I can still use raw Bitcoin to buy my drugs or whatever. I don't see the problem.

This other user of a compromised BCI wallet swept by the whitehat guy confirms that they do actually ask for your password. 
Obviously you have to empty your wallet first. Although this is a clusterfuck and a service that asks for your password raises all red flags, It actually makes sense that they require it since the private keys of a compromised address are easy to guess and anyone can claim ownership of a compromised address by signing a message with it. Since BCI hold their users wallets encrypted they require the password to access them and check if the address was indeed generated in that wallet.

I don't get this, I'm pretty confident btc will succeed and probably go up, still I sold at a loss because the downtrend is really obvious, now I've been able to buy back sub 500 and I've much more btc now so if it goes up I'll be in black much faster.
So regardless of what you think will happen in the future, holding during obvious downtrends instead of increasing your btc is something I don't really get.

That 0.2% rate is just a spike from the recent rally. Normally it sits at 0.04% per day during months and once you lend the trader has the option to cancel whenever he wants or the moment he sees a better rate but lenders can't, it's very biased towards traders and this spikes don't last long for that reason. Also there is a risk/reward reason for high rates if a margin cascade happens you risk losing your money as a lender they haven't provide any details about their insurance or the fiat part of their exchange.
Also this Hong Kong based exchange operates in a very grey legal area and has been very buggy recently (it's based on the bitcoinica code after all, a code written by Zhou Tong a 17 year old for an exchange that imploded some time ago) I removed all my money from there recently when I saw the balance and details from another account which wasn't mine, and likewise other people saw my account details (a cache leak they said it was  ).
So I'm not trying to spread FUD just explaining that there's always a reason for too good to be true rates and giving some facts, the decision is yours but it's important to do some due diligence.

No. Rapid growth of hashrate at this point comes solely from big mining farms that manufacture and deploy their own hardware and leads us to situations like the one with Ghash.
I'd rather have half of the hashrate in a truly decentralized peer to peer mining network, than the current trend of hashrate centralization.
And no, I don't mine and this is not about mining revenue, it's just common sense.

First, finex hasn't flash crashed (yet)
Second, long/short squeezes are part of a leveraged market dynamics, finex responsibility is to ensure their margin call system works so that lenders don't lose money, period. Not to implement "circuit breakers"or interfere with the market (they haven't)
Third, The only thing they did to prevent manipulation is single out specific orders that trade against their own interest and slow them down to let the order books to recover (what they call speed bumps) this doesn't cancel the order or "breaks any circuit" it just slows down single specific manipulative orders. It's not designed to interfere with the market.

Yeah except many of us did learn the lesson and still use them because there's no real alternative for serious trading.
I lost 36% of my funds in bitfinex when they were hacked (managed to recover most but that is beside the point).

The idea is to have a second independent party involved so that if your personal security gets compromised their security must also be compromised by the same malicious entity in order to steal your coins and viceversa.
If this approach is made by some software that you use in your computer then there's no second party involved and only your security must be compromised since all keys are handled/created by you to steal your coins.
I personally think that offline generated (in an old device that's always offline) non reusable cold storage addresses are enough, but it's nice to see innovation and more options.

It has lost 75% of its value since December and we are still on a grim bear market, 250 - 275 was around the previous bubble ATH so it's reasonable to think it will retest that. I personally think we are almost at the bottom but I understand people that think the bottom is lower.

I love Bitcoin but I too dumped and took profits gradually at different stages of the downtrend, the amount of delusional posts in this sub made me confident in my decision.
I do have stop buys at different levels of the orderbook in case we rally (with 4x the purchasing power) and meanwhile I'm immune to downtrends which is the best strategy IMO.
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:05:29

The idea is good, to the people that doubt any new customers will join this new indebted exchange, if bitcoinbuilder has showed us anything is that there are a lot of risk takers willing to increase their btc stash. In fact an integrated bitcoinbuilder like service could be created to attract fresh coins from outside.

I agree in general with your views on trading, but you're wrong when you say early adopters that kept holding are the ones that made most out of bitcoin.

I'm not am early adopter (entered around $90) by I started cashing out when we started dropping below $800 and I'm really glad that I did, I don't daytrade but I think everyone should keep an eye on the market and react to very obvious market moving news, "Hodlin" blindly it's only safe for early adopters IMO.

Mining itself doesn't hurt, and yes it does help secure the network although unless you run quite expensive specialised mining equipment your contribution is negligible.
The reason for all the warnings is that people have historically been scammed BIG TIME by the companies that make this mining equipment. Also it's completely unprofitable for amateurs today, so it's just a word of caution so that newbies don't fall for it and become disillusioned with Bitcoin.

Yo can clearly see on the orderbook on the right hand side that for the price to go below $260 1352 BTC must be bought.
That is, there is buy order for 1352BTC at that price point so unless someone/someones sell those 1352BTC @ $260 to fill that order (or if the buy order is cancelled altogether) the price wont move below that point which acts as a support point.

Enable 2fa authentication, always trade using the escrow system they provide and never trade outside of the site, pay a lot of attention to user feedback (always trade with people with very good feedback even if their prices are less appealing). Maybe try your first transaction for a little amount and once you gain confidence go up from there.
I follow those simple rules and use common sense and almost all my trades have been successful both buying and selling, the only problem I had is some buyer that cancelled the trade because the price moved against him (annoying but no biggie) for me it's an awesome service.

I sold at a loss and I think it'll appreciate in value.
The reason is because when I sold I knew that we were in a very obvious downtrend so I was able to buy more as it kept going down. So bottom line I'm still down but I have increased my btc amount so much better than holding IMO and if it goes up since I have more btc I'll be in black faster...

KnC was built with the money of their "investomers" they've always had a miner friendly speech to lure more investomers, remember the hasrate protection program?

As far as I can tell this has nothing to do with Cyprus or what the title on the English article implies.
Some regions of Spain already made BANKS (not customers) pay some taxes for new deposits they get. Now the central government is making those taxes obsolete and introducing the same thing but unified and controlled by the central government instead of by regions (comunidades autónomas). Again a tax aimed at banks, not users, although I'm not sure if it leaves any door open legally to the latter.

@_date: 2014-07-07 22:58:14
It's bullshit, they are not taxing customer deposits, they are unifiying an already existing tax (nothing new) which is aimed at banks and the new law expressly prohibits them to transfer the tax to their customer deposits.

I pay for this because it provides a highly convenient interface with lots of charts, graphics and tools for trading, so you can have everything you need on a single window for trading. I can do the same with multiple browser windows actually and manually placing my orders on the exchange website, but it's much more inconvenient.
They do not charge fees on trades because they can't, only your exchange can charge you, they just provide an interface that links to your account on your exchange. You have to pay for their service on their website.

I see a lot of people here throwing very big numbers around. Please be VERY careful and keep your head cool, yes some months ago the Chinese did happen but past performance based on a specific event doesn't mean anything about future performance.
Of course the Second Market thing can happen and pump the price, but also the market has been downtrending steadily since January and it's very easily scared right now, some bad news  could throw us down pretty hard again.
So this is just a reminder to keep your head cool and only invest what you can afford to lose please.

So basically a law firm asked the taxing authority if online gambling sites that accept Bitcoin should apply for a license (like the ones that operate with fiat) the answer is yes because although Bitcoin can't be considered legal tender, users can change it for dollars euros etc.
The problem is that new AML laws in Spain prohibit cash transactions above 2500€ and apparently now Bitcoin falls under that same limitation.

Did you take a fucking second to review their OPEN SOURCE code before making outrageous claims??. Wallets are encrypted locally their chrome plugin avoids JavaScript injections even if their servers where compromised. All users that lost coins had bad security (tor mitm attacks, Trojans, no 2fa, password reuse, teamviewer left opten, etc)
Please be a little responsible when smearing a service if you don't know what you're talking about. Or provide a little proof of how an employee of an open source service that encrypts locally and can't even restore passwords will be able to steal from their users.

I don't agree with the train of thought that Bitcoin should be thousands of dollars or worth nothing in a couple of years...
Bitcoin has already been featured on mainstream media, most people know about it or have at least heard the word. Still is difficult to handle them for non tech savvy people. What if we have reached an equilibrium were new tech savvy people are entering Bitcoin and buying at roughly the same rate new coins are being created? I don't see why the price can't hover between 500 - 700 for a couple of years.

What is the cost average of your coins?
@_date: 2014-05-07 05:51:57
Exactly. In my own experience the fact that much more people is aware of bitcoin isn't good news by itself. Most of my friends/family have now heard of it, but always surrounded by bad news and since most people don't even bother trying (or are unable) to understand how amazing the technology is the disregard it like some sort of ponzi/scam where a lot of people lost money on the internet... we won't see buying pressure coming from them.
Cutting your loses can be a dangerous thing if a rally starts, but be careful with the advice you receive in here, any legitimate opinion that causes selling pressure is frowned upon. In my own case I sold around 740 because I thought the decline without the Chinese buying pressure will continue I took a small loss and now I'm able to buy much more if I want or just wait in the sidelines very relieved. Do your own research keep a cold head and isolate yourself from hateful critics and adamant pumpers to make your decision. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:59:59

The fact that people think it's a funny internet money/scam/ponzi is a bigger problem than you think, the technology behind Bitcoin is really complex to the average Joe so they make their opinion about it based on the sensationalist news/bullshit that has surrounded Bitcoin recently. Most of The people today know about Bitcoin but unfortunately they disregard it without even bothering to research what it really is. That's Mt experience at least with my social circle it's getting to a point where I just shut up when the topic is being discussed by my clueless friends/family so I don't get angry.

@_date: 2014-03-04 09:34:02
Yes that's also a very interesting approach. In fact it resembles some sort of raw 2 factor authentication for moving funds, where you need the key in your computer and the one on your phone to spend, but also you have a paper backup in case you lose one of the other two, and this paper backup on itself isn't enough to steal your coins (if someone managed to steal this paper backup). Yep interesting indeed.
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:21:22
Actually he was the only one holding his private keys. Blockchain doesn't hold private keys, the guy had his private keys on his computer (wallet backup) protected by a reused password, and that's how the hacker got to them.

I do agree with everything you said except for the GOX reference. This is exactly the opposite scenario, the fact that unlike GOX they don't have access to your bitcoins (that's why they are forced to ask for your password/encryption key) means they can't steal/lose them like what happened at GOX.

2FA doesn't work for API keys, also this guys kept an unencrypted file with all of their passwords in their computer, so the counterparty risk of coinbase is much less than the risk of their own incompetence, if they have the coins in cold storage and keep their private keys in plain text accessible by anyone (like their passwords) they are better off using coinbase vault...

As you may or may not be aware, bitcoins exists only on the internet, you can't "travel" with them, they only thing you can do is travel with a private key to unlock a certain amount of bitcoin which is similar to traveling with the key to your home safe. Or in case of a brainwallet is similar to travel remembering the combination of the safe at your home.
And no, traveling with the key of your safe deposit box, or with a combination in your brain isn't comparable to traveling with undeclared physical bank notes/goods.

Buying a rig and preordering vaporware, are two different things. Their investomers at the time of course expected a return, but they took a HUGE leap of faith with them and trusted the things they were saying at the time:
From their first btctalk post: *We are Swedish miners that are producing our own ASIC miners to strengthen the market and* **avoid monopoly.**
From their network protection statement: *At KnCMiner we are aware of the service we are providing to our customers. We are also aware that we need our customers to have a return on their devices [...], we need to be cautious we don’t ship too many devices and therefore reduce the return to our customers.*
So my jupiters did ROI big time, still, I've the right to be angered as a customer when I see them betray all the "values" they claimed to have to lure investomers into risking their money at the time.
I don't have the slightest problem with a company being greedy seeking the most profitable business model. I do have a problem with a company that outright lies to their customers instead of being honest about their real intentions.

The opposite will happen actually. If the floodgates are open sellers will be also aware, not only buyers, everyone with fiat in Gox will try to grab cheap coins as you say driving the Gox price up almost instantly also most sellers will rearrange their asks according to the new situation once the news are out. So maybe someone gets lucky and is able to grab some cheap coins if they are really fast but those will be the exception.

For the price to go up we need buying pressure.
As you say everyone has heard about Bitcoin now, the problem is that most people (this is my personal experience) have heard about it surrounded by bad news or sensationalist bullshit by the general media and despite not having clue about what it really is they disregard it as some sort of ponzi/magic money thing were a lot of people lost money recently. We won't see buying pressure from them.
We've seen a lot of good news recently but maybe we're turning into a already invested somewhat closed circle  and without new blood to generate buying pressure we won't see a run up in price.

~~No. This is not a database exploit that can be run against a server alone.

EVERYONE trading with leverage can be liquidated at any price completely out of their control if their collateral isn't enough to avoid a margin call. It's an automatic process, your bitcoins are sold by the exchange and there is nothing you can do about it when trading with leverage. You should Google "long squeeze" son.
That's what happened here, period. A margin call cascade for people trading on the MT4 platform with up to 3x leverage. Probably caused intentionally by a whale dumping a huge amount to trigger a margin call cascade (they succeeded) so that they can buy cheap coins.

So basically you provided your login/password to that site, and they used that info to log into the real blockchain and transferred your coins from your account, right? 
So, BlockChain should have the IP address of the hackers from when they accessed your account, you should email them and tell them what happened. The IP alone may not be of much use although maybe there is a pattern BloackChain could use to ban any strange access to an account, from an IP address from the same block, or from a user with the same browser fingerprint* it's worth investigating this to protect other blockchain users.
* a browser fingerprint is all the information a browser provides when accessing a website that can provide a very specific profile of a user: screen resolution+system OS+browser type and version+plugins installed and version of each of them etc.

This is completely misleading.
This tax is aimed at banks and they are expressly prohibited by the same law to transfer it to their customers deposits. In fact most regions (comunidades autónomas) already have this tax in effect and the central government is just unifying it. To compare this to what happened in Cyprus were the government directly took a percentage of customers deposits is extremely misleading.
And yes banks may still try to transfer it to customers indirectly via fees or whatever but this is the same with any other private or public business that is taxed.

Reposted BULLSHIT.
They ARE NOT taxing people deposits. They are unifying an ALREADY EXISTING tax in many regions (comunidades autonomas) aimed at banks NOT customers deposits, to the point that the new law expressly prohibits banks to transfer this tax to their customer deposits (they may still try to do it via fees or whatever, but that scenario is the same with any private business that has to balance new taxes and their margins).

This is only fiat liabilities. BTC liabilities are not taken into account here. Mark himself explained they are trying to get the liquidators to not account BTC liabilities in its fiat value (which is dynamic and a fixed exchange rate should be established) but rather in BTC itself and still we don't know how authorities are going to treat BTC balances lost.
All in all, if you account for btc with even the lowest exchange rate, the can't cover even 5% of their liabilities.

Cloud mining is just buying bitcoin slowly and more expensive than buying on an exchange. Why would you do that?
You pay $1050 on an exchange and you get 1 bitcoin now, you pay $1050 on cloud mining and they will slowly give you a total amount of 0.8 bitcoin or so.

You just answered yourself the question about why ID is needed. It's the only way to enforce the network of trust you speak of, since without ID you can just create infinite nicknames/digital personas, you can keep creating new alt accounts and screwing people over with no consequence, if you provide your real ID you can't fake that one and your reputation sticks and it's reliable.
In fact many scammers do that, they register a nick, behave like good boys for a while them they screw people over and register with another nick, rinse and repeat.

Not really. Shorting occurs on platforms that allow leverage trading, for both shorting AND for going long.
So while the fact that people borrow BTC to sell it might seem to increase selling pressure, the reality is that much more people are borrowing USD on those platforms to buy BTC (going long) cancelling out shorters by a big margin. In fact in such and endless downtrend, people going long are actually creating more selling pressure when they are force to close their positions since they are forced to sell the btc the bought with borrowed USD.

Assuming that all people are either extreme growth maximalists or extreme decentralization maximalists isn't true at all, that's the far side of both spectrums and very few people fall squarely there actually. I do think that there's in fact an overlapping area of a solution most won't love but could agree on as a starting point. The problem here is way more puerile than technical. A lot of egos have been hurt and a lot of animosity exists that has very little to do with with the tech. I think it's worth trying to fix this human problems in order to advance in the technical ones instead of just surrender.

Really high risk right now. That's the reason for the apparently high return (you have to take into account the 15% cut finex takes from your profits).
You see, right now there are around $30M in swaps which means that around 50000btc have been bought using lended funds the price of those btc is decreasing so many traders will start being margin called (liquidated) which involves selling their btc position to cover the lended funds, creating more selling pressure on the market and driving the price further down. The problem with this is that the more people are being liquidated amplifies the price downtrend triggering more margin calls and stop loses.
If the price goes down enough there is no way in hell to recover $30M by selling those 50000btc which of course will crash the market piercing through the order books and driving the price to the ground. And guess who is gonna get burned...
Right now usd swaps are like a big balloon that needs a sharp red candle to act as the needle that burst it generating a cascading effect.
They mention some sort of "insurance" on their website without giving any numbers or specifics of course, their previous insurance was a meager pool of $50K heh I wonder how do they plan to cover $30M (tip: they can't).
So yeah high risk/relative high reward. Still you take less risk if you go to primedice and make a 95% odds bet than putting your money on this powder keg for a ~0.12% return.
I didn't even bother mentioning the counterparty risk of them closing shop etc etc.

Eh not really. When you move to an exchange the alts you got from that service, this alts go into their cold storage with all the stock of that alt the exchange has. Chain is broken.

@_date: 2015-01-26 19:04:15
Although I get what you're saying, I don't think satoshi meant for his invention to be completely isolated a disconnected from everything, having fiat gateways like exchanges are useful to bitcoin especially when they don't have any control/impact over the core parameters of the bitcoin network.
The moment you click "withdraw btc" from your exchange you leave the centralized regulated world and are back exactly were satoshi intended, so it's just a matter of choice and less friction for non miners to acquire BTC, not some sort of treason to Satoshis principles.

As other people have already explained it to you, those 18k btc lost are part of the pooled BTC balance of all Bitstamp customers. So everybody is part of the 18k balance and the secured cold storage balance at the same time.
Since the value of the theft is around $5M they've probably bought back those BTC OTC with their VC money, but, even if they haven't we wouldn't know unless there is a full scale bank run and everybody withdraws the around 200K BTC they hold in total till the last 18K which is the point were we would know for sure if they are running a fractional reserve.
Everyday that passes without this doomsday scenario materializing and the exchange and specifically withdrawals working flawlessly it means more operating profit to offset the theft and more confidence in their customers.
I personally think that this business is more than profitable enough to eat the $5M loss specially with VC money to back it up upfront, and an estimated 6 months to completely offset the loss with operating profits.

Wrong. Please do consider mining as a way to make money. That's the real incentive that drives the difficulty to where it is know, securing the network is the side effect. And we should be completely ok with that while it keeps pushing the difficulty far beyond where altruistic incentives would have taken it.

I need some help figuring out how to sign offline a transaction using an unspent output.
So let's imagine this is my cold storage: 1Pu8XKpri7kG954EKZc44tQ5b8hmeMe9Tq
On my online computer I take this unspent output from that address:
    {
    	 
    	"unspent_outputs":[
    	
    		{
    			"tx_hash":"c924d48920b63d48608cf6a1fd7357fc939bcafd82a4322154e49da35e0bfda8",
    			"tx_hash_big_endian":"a8fd0b5ea39de4542132a482fdca9b93fc5773fda1f68c60483db62089d424c9",
    			"tx_index":75804000,
    			"tx_output_n": 0,
    			"script":"76a914fb2ead502c45f34cbf9f48f9b2b5f833a92fdec088ac",
    			"value": 35018645,
    			"value_hex": "02165795",
    			"confirmations":1
    		}
    	  
    	]
    }    
    
Using that I wan't to sign a transaction on my offline computer to send the btc from that output to this address 1CC8VAN5poXykRqE81Y3XqwqYPzTHKtxwh, I don't want to use a wallet software on the offline computer, just a saved version of the brainwallet.org website (transaction tab) and the private key which I have written down in plain text.
Can I do it? Thanks

Exactly that, it routes your traffic through their own servers therefore the exchange has no way of knowing your IP or where are you from, they only have an meaningless IP (assuming your VPN provider doesn't keep logs and has a canary in the mine system)

@_date: 2015-01-01 09:41:42
Nah this is bullshit. Of course there are amateur miners that make 30k a year. The ones that made an initial investment bigger than that and are still struggling to break even.
Your keep talking about power rates, while the problem is with initial investment and having to buy hardware from companies that sell it a price that makes sense to not even bother mining themselves with it.
Even if you take a huge risk and made a significant investment and got lucky with a couple of negative difficulty adjustments, the falling price in this bear market will fuck you up.
So TLDR, unless you design, manufacture and deploy your own sha256 chips it makes no sense to mine in this circumstances as an amateur, you might find tons of high risk investments with higher yields than mining.

Yeah so more guesswork being pulled out of your ass about a trend reversal like the one we've been hearing since the $800 - $500 - $300 etc. 
The truth is that this thing could very well go into the $100s, no one knows, the price isn't about fundamentals/infrastructure anymore it's about the equilibrium between a huge mining inflation and the lack of buyers for an asset that is perceived as toxic and whose awesome technology isn't understood by the general public (they don't care).
All the weak/strong hands talk is just a bullshit coping mechanism. Props to all the "weak hands" that sold through out the year and that now can even buy more if they want to, or set up stop buys on an exchange so they won't lose the train if a rally starts but also unlike bagholders they're not affected if this thing keeps crashing.

Son if people start buying 0.09 btc each, the price goes up and the first buyers of the 0.09 are incentivized to sell to realize a profit, and the last people to buy are taking a huge risk, plus the market is dynamic and as soon as the price goes up more people will take that opportunity to dump and get out of this mess.

So I do have one of this cards, and here is my review of it.
First of all, the KYC/AML ANX requires is quite harsh, I had to send them not only proof of residence + ID, but also a selfie holding my ID, plus they send a letter with a code to your home address to verify it and until you receive it and enter the code on their website you won't get verified.
The card is actually issued by this company:  an e-cheque service from China, their service seems to be aimed at Chinese citizens/students that travel abroad and need a prepaid card.
The card took 1 month to arrive to Europe from Hong Kong with regular shipping, It's a MasterCard card with no chip and no holder name (this is a problem in my country where merchants aren't used to anonymous cards and are suspicious), it doesn't have any bitcoin/ANX reference on it, only the transforex logos.
Loading it takes TIME, first you get a "quote" when you load btc on your ANX account (usually with a somewhat big spread, although through ANXPro you can apparently set your own sell orders, I haven't tried this yet). Once you accept their quote your BTC gets converted to USD and you have to wait for this USD to be transferred to the card, in my case it took 2 business days! which was very disappointing to tell you the truth.
So TLDR ANX has some sort of deal with a prepaid MasterCard provider in China called Transforex, and when you load your card they transfer the funds from their platform to your card, that is a process that takes between 1 and 2 business days.

It means that if the market is moving fast or violently your order might be executed at a different price.

I don't think reducing or increasing the block size in a range between 4mb - 500k will have any noticeable direct impact on the inherent friction (resources and incentive needed) of running a node, by contrast I think asphyxiating BU with an small increase in that range (amplified greatly by segwit) will have a way more noticeable indirect impact on the incentives to run a node (bitcoin going to the moon, more users joining no infighting/confusion etc.) this IMO will lead to more people interested in running nodes than in an scenario where shit hits the fan and we end up with two chains even if nodes are a tiny bit more lightweight.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:58:26
You are right. Public keys are hashed when shared as bitcoin addresses, when you expose the public key directly the layer of protection the hashing provides is removed so you relay solely on the protection of ECDSA, which of course is more than enough unless ECDSA is compromised somehow, but if you didn't share your pub key then in order to compromise your privt key in addition to ECDSA you'll need to compromise both SHA256 and RIPMD hashing algorithms.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:38:21
No one assumes miners represent economic majority because that is actually a bullshit concept impossible to define. The massive hashpower of Bitcoin is the main differentiating factor with altcoins, it's at the core of the network security and value, besides, miners already can chose what they do accept for the blocks they validate anyway.
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:32:53
So this is cool and all, but unfortunately Bitcoin mining chips in toasters or smartphones that credit just a small amount of what they mine to the user are a extremely inefficient way to "lubricate" or incentivize anything. 
If you want idle hardware resources to do other things or be part of a hypercomputer, using an incentivizing system that uses those same idle resources to hashing doesn't make any sense. 
In case the incentive doesn't come from mining bitcoins directly (and the announcement was just a smoke screen) but instead being paid bitcoins from 21inc directly based on the resources you provide, then they might as well use PayPal, dollars or amazon gift cards...
Also a hypercomputer made with decentralized resources but of course in the hands of a very centralized US law abiding single company doesn't sound that exciting.

Very interesting post. The weak point I see is the correlation between blocksize and node count you base everything on. I think for small blocksizes of 4mb - 2mb - 1mb - 500k that correlation doesn't exist at all and the only problem is the hassle/lack of incentive to run a full node. Someone that has the expertise and incentive to run a node nowadays won't change anything if blocks are increased to 2mb (it's 2017) specially if Bitcoin price goes higher for lack of infighting, likewise 500k blocks won't bring barely new node operators.
You argue about how contentious Hardforks are dangerous and I agree 100% yet we are closer to one than ever and I don't think there's a strong argument about how the benefits of having &lt; 2mb blocks right now outweigh the benefits of ending this war. 
I personally think 2mb+segwit is the way to go to, less dangerous than a BU HF and 2x the capacity increase for segwit which will leave a lot of people happy and BU without oxygen.
I wish there was a way to vote/signal for something like that.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:04:46
Wrong. Public keys of unspent addresses are hashed with two rounds of SHA256 and 1 round of RIPMD160 so no one can know the public key unless you spend some bitcoin or sign some message from that address in which case you have to reveal the public key and the rest of the network can verify it correspond to the hashed address.

There are many profesional OTC platforms that can handle that volume, maybe not in a single trade but spread into 5 trades or so it's completely doable nowadays.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:41:31
If this trade happens OTC it wouldn't crash any market because it's just a private trade between two dudes with 0 net effect on the markets unless any of them liquidates it's coins afterwards on an exchange.

Except it can't do it safely because it's contentious and will never activate unless the contentious part is solved and you get miners on board, and still, a blocksize increase MUST happen at some point in time anyway, it's 2017 we should be able to upgrade an antispam measure from 8 years ago FFS
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:29:20
Yes, I think that's why miners were onboard with segwit back in the Hong Kong agreement days. I think that their refusal of segwit is based on the perception they have that we NEED a blocksize increase and Core will block it at all costs so they don't have any other leverage than to block segwit.

One (controversial) solution, not The Solution.
I personally think the easiest solution is for wallets to calculate the correct fees and make it obvious for the user that lower fees have the risk of unconfirmed transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:39:57
Hi, what is this "rest" of the network you speak of? Miners did agree to segwit in Hong Kong, maybe instead of treating them the way they did someone should really explain why increasing the blocksize even a little bit in 2017 is completely and utterly impossible and shouldn't be even discussed at all under any circumstance. It's like a religious dogma at this point and I don't get it.

"Stupid miner voting nonsense" man what's your problem with miners? How do you plan to change anything in the network without miners accepting it? they can already vote with their hashpower what types of blocks they do process anyway unless you fork to a different algo or something retarded like that. Besides unlike you they don't serve their ego, they have a real economic incentive to make Bitcoin a success that aligns with us users. 
It's very easy to be destructive of others proposals when you can't propose anything yourself that has the slightest amount of traction.
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:21:30

It's perfectly ok to explain what a blockchain is with buzzwords when you know what you are talking about. The problem here is using empty buzzwords when you don't even have the slightest clue what you're talking about, please listen to the part where they ask here what a blockchain is.

No reasonable person will conclude that someone that committed a crime should be free but as it turns out based on some technicality like if the evidence against him was illegally obtained he goes free. The reason is that you have to play by the rules and you can't bend them for edge cases or moral dilemmas because they stop being rules them. The code of the The DAO is the fine print of the contract and the "hacker" just understood the fine print better than the rest.
@_date: 2016-06-16 05:51:53
So that is what *A peer 2 peer electronic* **CASH** *system* looks like huh? A settlement layer too expensive to be used as, well, a cash system? 
There's an irony here somewhere.
@_date: 2016-06-29 07:21:54
Yet they will be able to collect more fees per mined block which may compensate for the wasted hashrate?
@_date: 2016-06-21 09:03:36


You see THAT is the problem. A couple of thousand $ isn't enough to soft/hard fork the blockchain but what about 100k or 1million or 10 million, where are you supposed to draw the line? who is supposed to draw that line? based on what rules? based on what authority?. A blockchain that can be forked at any time based on unpredictable subjective politics (reminiscent of legacy banking bailouts) can't be trusted. As for the devs making the choice, it's the Ethereum Foundation leading this change, it's them making a choice now that they wouldn't do if it was just you and me as I said.


Who will trust bitcoin as a method of payment after the bubble of 2013 and the fluctuation in price?
People will use bitcoin because there are huge advantages in doing so.
The price of bitcoin is a external factor that has nothing to do with how robust the protocol and how immutable it's blockchain really is, no one will ever roll back or fork the bitcoin blockchain to screw with the mtgox hacker or whatever, and this is the huge advantage of bitcoin that make people use it, its blockchain can be trusted.

Use this website to know what fee you should be paying:
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:49:10
6 blocks! The fact that by chance those 6 blocks took just 27 minutes is irrelevant the median for 6 blocks is 60 minutes sometimes much more, which ruins any merchant transaction. This, again, is with the default normal DYNAMIC fee of the most popular Android wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:36:25
I don't even know who those guys are and why you hate them (maybe you are right in doing so) but this is completely irrelevant. That woman wasn't even able to explain what a blockchain is yet she hosts the "Global blockchain Forum" and the "Blockchain alliance" WTF?! Regardless of the guys from the interview don't you think that exposing this fact is relevant? The last thing we need is clueless people spreading misinformation and using blockchain as a buzzword.
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:51:32

I'm sorry but bitcoin is: "An Electronic Peer 2 Peer Cash System" no digital gold or whatever bullshit people come up with nowdays.

The only idiots I see are the ones blaming him for I don't know what yet. He modified an open source protocol. Period.

@_date: 2017-01-14 07:53:10
Anyone knows how he did it?
I understand that the only real address is the dayah one since the rest can't be vanity generated, so he created a tx were the only real output comes from that address and the rest of the addresses are added as outputs but without the private key, then he kept trying to mine a block (he must be a miner) with only that transaction until he succeeded which probably did require quite a bit of hashrate committed to the task.
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:01:21
Oh this one is easy. 
First and foremost the ether vm doesn't have any bug whatsoever it works as intended.
They are destroying something crucial like the neutrality of their blockchain that, again, doesn't have any bug to recover back money from some poorly coded smart contract, but of course they won't/can't do that for all the smart contracts that may fail in the foreseeable future, they are doing it this time because there are a lot of privileged people (the devs themselves) that have money invested but if it were just you or me losing a couple thousand $ to a badly coded contract they will give you the middle finger.
So, who the hell is going to trust a blockchain that can be rolled back arbitrarily everytime some elite decide so?? Who will trust a smart contract again when the first smart contract coded and reviewed by the brightest in this space has failed so spectacularly?

They shouldn't be asking your permission to run whatever software they want either.

Bitcoins value not only comes from decentralization which isn't threaten hardware and bandwith wise by reasonable bigger blocks than what we had in 2009 now that we approach 2020.
It's value also comes from the ability for people to use it, don't expect stratospheric price either if it's turned into a elitist settlement network.

@_date: 2016-06-16 06:01:33
No, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I just expect it to work so that the normal dynamic fee in the most popular Android wallet (Mycellium) doesn't take 20+ blocks to confirm because it's impossible to predict when a fee bidding war will erupt and miners have no way to cash in those fees.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:40:13

They don't know or so they say. The only thing that is known so far is that the hacker was able to compromise the internal bfx network, he then used the bitgo API keys from bitfinex to remove the security limit on the number of tx bitgo was able to sign at once (astonishingly he was able to remove this API limit using the API itself), he then used the internal bfx pvt key to sign the tx and the API of bitgo to make bitgo sign the tx with their key.

Everything depends on what happens with Chinese exchanges now that Sauron has his eye fixed in them, for starters trading with margin isn't legal there so will see what happens with okcoin futures platform and the horde of Chinese gamblers there which used to pump the price with their short squeezes.

Neither people running nodes nor core or AXA have the same economic incentives or money invested as miners, this isn't a fair comparison, miners have the right to run the software they think makes more sense just like anyone can run a node with the software they want.

Yes he obviously doesn't have the private keys for these addresses but one thing is sending bitcoin TO one of this type of addresses which works as long as the checksum of the receiving address is ok like the bicoin eater address, and another thing is this case where he appears to be sending bitcoin FROM this addresses instead of TO them, notice they are part of the inputs of the tx, I thought the network required you to be able to sign using the pvt key of any input you want to include in a tx so I'm not sure how he did that, how he was able to include addresses without pvt key as the inputs (not the destination) of a transaction.

No. Real cold storage is the one that you don't need to access periodically, like the seed sitting in a safe deposit box for example. A business like coinbase has at best "lukewarm" storage, yes their coins are in a offline machine but they need  employees to access that "cold storage" constantly to process customer withdrawals and if they guys at shapeshift know something is that trusting even your employees can be a risky business.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:23:49

Yeah but which one??
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:09:14
Exactly. There are hundreds of thousands of BCH already in exchanges why are traders which are more trigger happy than hodlers not dumping them? Are they not human or something? Do they not represent a sample of the market? This might be a case of sell the rumour buy the news.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:10:37
Yes it is. That seed is bip44 which means it's compatible with many other wallets people will warn you about online wallets because of the risk of MITM attacks or malware, but the seed in itself is safe and you can even delete your account at blockchain as long as you keep your seed and recover your funds at any time.

When you invest in a company you use banks and intermediaries to do so, so you don't need to know anything. With bitcoin is different because you need to understand the inner workings because otherwise you can expose your private key and lose your money or fuck up the fee of a tx etc.

Yeah, you see, this kind of stupid unreal threats is probably at the heart of the trust problem we have between Core supporters and miners.
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:06:19
Not really, Bitcoin has a huge use case for speculators which for me it's as valid as the use case of holders or dark markets etc. Speculators could never expect the amount of liquidity and trading tools a centralized exchange offers.
Also even as a holder if you want to buy big amounts decentralized exchanges could be a pain in the ass with slippage, low liquidity, escrow etc.
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:10:19
Or not.
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:21:52

Bitcoin Cash proved what? Bitcoin cash is a shitty implementation with bullshit like EDA causing most of its problems. A 2MB blocksize implemented by competent devs alongside segwit won't disrupt decentralization (we are in 2018).
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:44:45
Yes but between panic sellers or  people that bought into the hype and are now destroyed and knife catchers and people gambling this is the bottom, not between China and the West.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:24:43
Yeah and it'll also cure cancer /s 
Bullshit. One thing is stopping fake volume and shenanigans, another very different one is putting roadblocks to a market, any market.
The less liquid and more difficult it is to trade something the more volatile and less stable it becomes actually due to dry liquidity bubbles and subsequent corrections it's more easy to manipulate by whales when people can't short it effectively. Also speculating with it's price in China has been a big contributor to it's growth and where the price is today whether people like it or not, specially now that using it as a currency with a chocking blockchain is no longer a use case. Remember that hodlers are speculators too.
@_date: 2017-01-28 07:36:34
Everybody got a 36% balance cut at bitfinex not only people holding BTC, the losses were distributed between all customers even if you only had ether or USD, so the cut was bigger than what you can make in 2 years lending there, and they still don't even know how the hacker did it, so do the math.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:15:06
err you do know you have to pay periodically for your safe deposit box right?, as long as you do that they won't touch it and obviously you won't forget about it, and if something happens to you your relatives will inherit it just like the balance on your account.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:18:38
Relax. It seems you didn't get what I was referring to. I was just referring to the fact that you don't need to know anything about a company for the process of buying it's stock securely because you do not handle it, it's the intermediaries the ones that handle the paperwork. Whereas with bitcoin you need to understand how it works because you are handling it yourself and if you screw up the handling it's gone.
I was not referring to the value or market swings of either, just to the mechanics of buying and keeping them.

You understand nothing, miners are leaving bitcoins on the table because they are not able to get those fees since blocks are full they have been begging for an increase in block size since forever, they have been lied to, also LN diverts fees and tx away from them so it makes sense that they want on chain scaling.

No hate. Your are not the first and won't be the last to be salty about bitcoins success, back when I invested in 2013 with BTC at $120 the buttcoin subreddit was all the rage parroting the same edgy shit you are saying now. I'll never hate on people like you, after 2600% ROI and being able to leave my job I just smile and wish you the best :)

Can these be used as cold storage? So that in order to spend your cold storage you have to break the seal?

We are about to see about that once difficulty stabilizes and it becomes more profitable to mine and deposits open.

Not really, some people just want to hedge their BTC position and shorting and leverage are very useful for this.
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:12:17
Yeah good luck with that, I wonder who will invest millions of dollars to mine in your new chain so it has decent hashrate now that they know you can fuck them over at any time.

Is it really that difficult to memorize 12 words of your whole wealth depends on it? I mean actors memorize entire screenplays!!
With your 12 word seed you can access your bitcoins anytime anywhere, mycellym allows you to type the seed send the amount of bitcoins you want from cold storage and it immediately deletes it. 
Also keep some spare bitcoins in your mobile phone or webwallet, enough so that you don't need to access cold storage all the time.
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:35:17
It would double the data that can fit into blocks not the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:58:10
You can always print your 12 word seed and put it in a safe deposit box in a bank. That's probably the most secure way of storing it if you are so scared about yourself. The fact that coinbase is regulated is irrelevant, in fact bfx got hacked because it was forced by the SEC regulations to use bitgo, coinbase DOES NOT have their customer Bitcoins insured, only their fiat, and that's the only thing that matters.
But hey you are obviously free to do whatever you want with your money.
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:54:47
Because it's not unreasonable to think that 2mb blocks are a good solution in 2018 and its technically impossible to prove it threatens decentralization more than a 1 mb limit almost ten years ago did. You might disagree with this view, fine. Or think that segwit is better solution, golden. But  saying that honest devs like Gavin are against bitcoin and everyone that thinks the spam limit satoshi put in place is a little obsolete are outside the community is crazy talk. It reminds of the people that claim blockstream is here to destroy bitcoin it's the same level of bullshit paranoid thinking.
Trying to *dehumanize* your enemy or in this context consider him an outsider to justify your actions instead of engaging in a technical discussion isn't new but it's bullshit and sad and it happens in both camps.

The purpose of this currency is speculation for many of the Chinese so no, having a centralized exchange with a big set of trading tools, liquidity and small spreads doesn't defeat the purpose of the currency for them.

Nah not really. It's the only leverage we have against AXA.
@_date: 2017-01-21 07:39:44
Or maybe, just maybe, instead of this little crazy story of yours. The miners which are paid by the protocol itself and have the greatest economic incentive to make it succeed are weary of the devs on AXAs payroll after being lied to and threaten with POW changes.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:00:06
So BCH is manipulated right? The only attempt to manipulate its price was some people here with big mouths telling others how they will dump the shit out of it and how it was going to go to the core. That manipulation attempt failed spectacularly. 
The course of decentralization is not threaten by a 2MB block in fucking 2018 we both know that's bullshit.

@_date: 2017-01-05 03:07:35
You don't know what you are talking about, your 12 word seed is your private keys and it's client side generated and encrypted in your browser BEFORE leaving your computer, blockchain doesn't have your private keys stored anywhere. That's the reason why you can't recover your account after losing your password if you don't have your seed.
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:22:56
The trader has 500k, borrows 9.5million and buys contracts worth 10millions, the exchange monitors the value of that 10million position at all times, if the position starts losing value because the market moves against the trader, the moment the position is worth 9.5million the trader gets liquidated the position is sold in the market for 9.5millions which are given back to the lenders and the trader is left with nothing.

I'm not sure why you prefer the protocol to be completely controlled by devs paid by AXA instead of by people paid by the protocol itself wich have an economic incentive that aligns with users. You can't tell the economic incentive of AXA who currently has devs on payroll, that's how it is.
Anyway who will mine invest millions of dollars to mine in your new weak ass chain if they know you can fuck them over at any time? A new POW is probably the stupidest idea.

This is not really true, Core have a massive momentum advantage and AXA knows that, putting them in payroll and aligning development of Bitcoin with its business model is a genius move. Even if you can chose whatever software to run most people won't risk it and will stay with core unless something really bad happens, the risk of a contentious hard fork is to great, I'm pro segwit and pro onchain scaling at least to 2mb yet I would probably stick with  core as a precaution.
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:17:29
Yeah everyone that disagrees with you is a psychopath right?, and you are the only one in possession of the absolute truth /s
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:24:35
Except that without leverage you can't twist AXAs arm to do bigger blocks because it's against their business model and they didn't bankroll Blockstream to lose money.

You already gave the power to AXA who has devs on payroll, the difference is that miners earn Bitcoin and their interests are aligned to ours,  AXA doesn't own or eran Bitcoins, their business model relies on sidechains being a thing or who knows on what.

Nah not really. There's no blocksize increase in their roadmap, some vague statement about the future could mean 15 years from now as far as we know, Core is so entrenched that by the time they include this in their roadmap it won't even matter.
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:55:38
Because tether is a company that has a bank account with the exact amount of USD as tethers in circulation so every single tether is backed up by a real USD in that bank account, this company is the one that issues or retires tether so that the available amount in circulation always correspond with the real USD in that bank account. That's the reason why USDT requires AML/KYC on many platforms unlike decentralized crypto currencies.

We? as in you are the elected spokesperson of node operators or what? most nodes will act on self interest and will fork if a big enough amount of hashrate backs that fork, that's how it is, I know I will with my node and I'm neutral to either scaling solution.
@_date: 2016-11-08 10:43:23
Since apparently anecdotal experience is worth a shit, I also live in a big Western European city and my current symmetric 500Mbps fibre is way cheaper than my 2010 256kbps/64kbps dsl line. That's not to mention the bandwidth of the 4G phone you probably have in your pocket...
Anyway, just google household bandwidth over the years for something based on facts, like this report from AKAMAI:
Also the fork you are referring to had nothing to do with nodes choking on bandwidth or storage for a 500Kb block, don't mix stuff to try to prove a false point.
@_date: 2016-12-11 08:29:46
Maybe they just read it on the fucking title:
"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash System**"
Stop being such a snob, Bitcoin might have been turned into a expensive settlement layer but calling people idiots for thinking naively that it still honors it's original purpose is acting like a dick.
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:48:43
Yeah, or maybe he isn't that comic book villain you portray and he just wants onchain scaling because he thinks is something better for bitcoin, he is entitled to campaign for what he thinks it's the best solution like Core supporters do.

In a month she will be smiling?? The dude didn't bought some coins for cold storage, the dude convinced his mother that probably knows very little about Bitcoin to take 8x leverage, that means borrowing $160000 do you know the daily interest they have to pay for that 160k if they have to wait a month??? Why the hell are you encouraging this stupid behaviour? This has more to do with gambling degenerates than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:51:04
Yeah I wish we had the damn 2mb fork and move forward with segwit... Honestly if bitcoin was able to handle 1mb blocks in 2010 it will should be able to handle 2mb in 2016.

Not really, 2mb blocks in 2016 are not really a threat to decentralization, the irony here is the people following blindly AXAs business model and it's censored centralized development and claiming to be the champions of decentralization.

Miners share the same interest as you and I do, they earn Bitcoin and if they threaten it they lose. AXA doesn't earn Bitcoin and their business model isn't aligned with our interests. It's ok to be wary about miners having too much power but I can't get why people trust blindly a corporation that has most devs of a decentralized system on payroll.

@_date: 2018-06-28 13:43:33
Again you are confusing income tax with long term capital gains tax. In your country you will not be charged half of that 1.4 m more like 20% or even nothing like in Germany because it's NOT income, it's longer term capital gain.
You don't need to manage yourself the airbnb apartments you have companies that do everything for you and you just collect payments every month, so like retirement.
As for risk if the bank bailouts and Lehman brothers have show us something is that real state is not riskier than having money parked in a bank at all.

You are not the only one that has a lot of money in Bitcoin and other people think that fucking up Bitcoin is actually not letting it scale at least a tiny amount onchain because it's against the business model that AXA has in mind for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:38:44
The law actually requires that they enforce KYC and lock accounts with suspicious activity specially from people moving 4 million dollars chunks like that. The only thing they are at fault here is probably slow responsiveness.
@_date: 2016-11-23 07:37:01
What a load of bullshit, they care about big blocks the same way you care about small ones or whatever the AXA developers tell you. They think it's best for bitcoin and more in line to the CASH system (as per whitepaper title) that Satoshi envisioned and that the real threat to decentralization is a corporate centralized development. They might be wrong but they should have been allowed to discuss it here without censorship.

Yawn, they didn't pump the price to 20k that was just one of the regular bitcoin bubbles fueled by new mostly naive investors and crazy media attention. Whales are not buying here and the time to sell its when you think the market is in bear more and we have more room to drop, which we have. Precisely because a whale is in the business of making money is why they are shorting and stop hunting naive traders and pushing the market down.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:48:00
Jesus Christ you are dense. The cost of mining only reflects the competition difficulty adjusts dynamically to the number of miners (hashrate) you are the one that made the stupid statement that miners won't drop that low if they don't drop that low it means they are surviving at whatever level the drop stopped. There's always an equilibrium If other miners can't mine with bitcoin at $1 then **I can** with my 5 year old jupiter bitcoin miner plugged to one of my solar panels.

By using Bitcoin instead of international transfers and bank accounts to move money from one country to another. Bitcoin is the decentralized part. The centralized part is converting bitcoin back to fiat locally and hedging it's value while it's being transferred.

We are discussing a private (centralized) business that is using bitcoin (a decentralized system) as the backbone for their operations to move money between borders since it's faster and cheaper than any other alternative. The link you posted is of an entirely centralized business that doesn't use bitcoin or even it's tech (blockchain) hence it's similar to western union or Ria and not relevant to the topic.

diversifying is a good idea when you already have a confortable amount of capital and you want to preserve it or grow it slowly. Being more agressive with your risk/reward is the only way to significantly impact your position (for better or worse). Back in the day (2013) I didn't diversify the modest capital that I had, instead I made an agressive bet on bitcoin which is what changed my life, thanks god I didn't diversify.

Oh the answer to that is easy. You see, the number of countries on planet earth is finite and as you can check here  none of them tax long term capital gains at 50% so you are either full of shit or just confusing income tax with long term capital gain taxes (which is what I suspect).
The fact that airbnb is restricted in your country is irrelevant since (*drum roll*) you can invest in property outside of your country, voila! I can tell you half a dozen places to invest in very profitable airbnb apartments around the Mediterranean.

This makes no sense. 40% only applies to a certain upper bracket of your annual income, and those 1.4 m are long term capital gains which are not taxed like that in many countries it's not even taxed at all and it's taxed around 20% on others.
So. You pay capital gains taxes and are left with 1.16m you buy 3 condos or apartments in a nice touristy area which you airbnb which net you between 2000 to 5000 a month between them depending on high/low season, you pay you regular taxes on that (which are nowhere near 40%) and can live very comfortable.

Except for insider information.
You may believe in Bitcoin with passion but if its creator starts cashing out all of a sudden just now, a lot of people will wonder why, will start getting anxious about maybe some protocol flaw the don't know about and they'll likely cash out so they won't be left holding the bag, this will push other more skeptical users to cash out etc... don't underestimate panic in a market.

First of all, you can always hedge the value of your bitcoins with futures, bitresrve, bitUSD, or even transfer them to an exchange an hold fiat there (bitfinex doesn't even require a verified account for that). So volatility won't be a problem.
You can convert them to cash at any time at the Bitcoin ATM in athens up to 30000€ a month (1000 every 24h) which IS a meaningful amount, but more importantly you can travel with your capital freely to arrange trades or even arrange them in Greece (extremely useful if more and more people use localbitcoins there).
In the end, why would you go back to regular banks and fiat after being burned when you can hold your capital like this.

Wow, first of all, the fact that this document leaked with a lot of confidential and internal operating info, even the contact details of the secret service agents working on the case doesn't inspire a lot of confidence on bitstamp.
Second they lost much more than $5m, they lost major customers like big payment processors (bitpay, Coinbase?) which they report it'll cost them $2m of additional revenue losses plus closer to another $1m for rebuilding the site and the investigation. They now have to recoup those losses with just 65k customers (many of which are probably not really active anymore).
Also the fact that an employee with high security clearance was able to Skype with random people, open and download personal emails/documents freely on a laptop with access to the fucking hotwallet!! is astonishing.
So tldr: hacker sent highly targeted phishing emails with a doc file with malware (vba obfuscated script), a sys admin opened one and got infected by some sort of RAT, hacker used the infected sys admin computer remotely to access the server hosting the hotwallet, downloaded the wallet.dat file and the rest is this clusterfuck...

It's a very risky practice to use TOR to access any https service on the clearnet since the https can be stripped by a malicious TOR exit node.
When using TOR you should access their TOR website to keep the connection encrypted end to end, or else you might get hacked, this affects all websites and is a problem on the users end.

It'll be awesome to have a wallet that can do this by having api support to your account in any of the big exchanges.
So you give it your api keys and when you do a BTC purchase it automatically replenish the amount using the fiat you've at your exchange account. The only problem is that you might need to withdraw manually your purchased coins from the exchange back to the wallet, but i prefer that to some all in one service like Coinbase where they can question my BTC purchases...
@_date: 2015-07-25 07:35:46
I have fresh wallets that I recharge often, I do several purchases a week, this are real transactions (not moving BTC back and forth) yet since those bitcoins haven't been idle in that address for a long period of time they won't impact the days destroyed metric. So I'm not sure the days destroyed is all that relevant to determine legit transactions, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:14:01
I don't think this is the case anymore, there aren't thousands of miners per pool, the good old days are over, mining is so industrialized that only big farms are competitive and not always, look at what happen to KNC probably nowadays only big mines with Asicboost type tech are competitive, small miners looking for the best pool are anecdotal nowadays unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:18:49
That's easy. They will follow the chain that lets them move their coins specially during times of high volatility. You underestimate the disruptive consequences losing 35% of hashrate at once will have on blocktimes, mempool backlog and specially fees.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:48:34
In your futures example the side that ends up with a higher price does not have an economic majority, that just represents the speculative sentiment at a very specific time that some traders and gamblers have, this people have mostly nothing to do with the real economic majority that is actually doing work and not speculating on exchanges. By that logic the economic majority had decided BFX tokens were worthless when they started trading at 0.23 yet some months later it turns out their real value is 1.
@_date: 2017-04-10 04:12:19
I mean that argument that since time has passed Satoshi nowadays will think differently is just a wild guess, It's also obviously a wild guess to say he will support BU but the truth is he did mention specifically how the current blocksize is just an antispam measure that could be increased when hitting capacity, which is onchain scaling, and he did title his invention as *electronic cash* after all.
@_date: 2015-08-31 09:49:11

UASF without bitpay or any big exchange behind is no immune response but rather a bluff. I disagree that the people that invested millions in securing the network should be called cancer the same way I disagree when people call devs names, that contentious bellicose approach is part of the problem IMO. This cancer you speak off did agree to segwit back in Hong Kong btw. Adam said that they don't support a HF to a reasonable blocksize increase to 2mb+segwit because it's dangerous but unless the upcoming BU hard fork or uasf chain split are safer this argument makes no sense to me. The way I see it now that it is completely obvious that segwit won't activate with 1mb blocks we have three options:
BU hard fork - Clusterfuck
UASF Chain Split - Clusterfuck
Core sponsored HF to 2MB + Segwit - Risky but doable as will rally a real economic majority behind it and make BU DOA.
@_date: 2017-04-14 04:34:22
Why is a contentious uasf chain split safer than a core sponsored HF to 2mb+segwit that miners did agree to in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:33:10
So there's no way to know the actual real support uasf has before it happens right? Activation happens regardless of support (sybil immune I guess) but also the outcome seems highly difficult to predict since the "economic activity" nodes might backpedal for example if the chain is attacked has low hashrate or is unreliable, no? At the end seems like a matter of who will be more strong in taking loses miners or economic nodes. Or am I missing something? I'm still trying to grasp the implications but the outcome to me doesn't seem so straightforward as some people claim.
@_date: 2017-04-12 06:09:23
Isn't double spend protection the cornerstone of Bitcoin unlike hashcash or previous failed electronic cash systems?

They charge 0.1% for any tx of more than 1 BTC so moving 10 BTC  between the supported exchanges costs 0.01 BTC vs 0.0002 of the standard BTC tx fee. I rather wait 30 minutes for my confirmations but thanks, having more options is good I guess.

Yes someone that has access to my cloud storage has to figure out not only that I have Bitcoin but that I used the hash of an image as a pvt key, before I posted this I could have gave you full access to my cloud storage, told you there's a pvt key somewhere and you wouldn't have figured it out that's not to mention the fact that the hash could obviously be salted. That's what hiding in plain sight is about.
As for a Dropbox employee using a massive amount of resources to hash every single file of the billions they do have in their servers just in case there's a Bitcoin user doing this ...come on. He'll be better off using those resources to crack brainwallets.
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:14:36
But UASF doesn't have enough economic support no bitpay and no big exchanges under these conditions a chain split will always result in the two currencies you speak off dividing the economy and that is way more dangerous than a core  sponsored HF to 2mb+segwit IMO

Except you can't go very far with physical cash, yes you can hide it in your mattress but good luck getting through the airport with a good amount of undeclared cash...
Don't get me wrong, I get your point, and it's true that Bitcoin only makes sense in some specific scenarios like transferring your wealth out of the country. Still, for the people (unfortunately a minority) who knows how to protect from volatility (futures, bitreserve, etc) it's a killer tool to protect against government fuckery.

The network effect works because there's a value proposition with stellar proof of work security behind it.
And I'm sorry but miners are already deciding what they do accept for example BTCC pool prioritises their own customers transactions when it finds a block ignoring fees and everything which is obviously against consensus rules.

I just hide it in plain sight. I use as the pvt key of my cold storage the hash of a picture from my collection. I have thousands of pictures and I chose a random one, unlike passwords and obfuscation methods it's very easy to remember a picture. I have it backed up along with the rest of my collection on the cloud were I can access it anytime.

@_date: 2017-04-07 05:52:23
Yes Sybil attacks aren't relevant for activation but node count is VERY relevant for it to succeed afterwards. If I understand correctly they theory behind uasf succeeding is that if a significant amount of nodes refuse non segwit blocks then miners are forced to relay segwit blocks. But the part that I don't understand is that even if uasf activates the node count that signals support could be faked and not really represent a economic majority, maybe the economic majority is more pragmatic and in the end chooses the more secure chain specially if the segwit one is being attacked or unreliable until difficulty adjusts due to low hashrate. Are all the scenarios being properly researched? I agree with the argument that HF are dangerous but this feels also dangerous tbh.
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:04:32
Not really, many people know perfectly well the increase segwit represents with 1mb blocks but think that we still need 2x that so segwit with 2mb blocks will get us there specially removing steam from BU and similar initiatives.

You probably overestimate the amount of verified users that request USD withdrawals bitfinex has. The reason why this overseas exchange that got hacked is so popular is precisely the fact that you don't need to be verified to deposit/withdraw via crypto ergo most of their users do that. People that really want to withdraw via bank wires use the safe exchanges gemini gdax etc.
Also people forget you can use any of the other cryptos that trade on bitfinex to transfer to another exchange.
Based on this two facts I think this issue is negligible in terms of price action.
@_date: 2015-07-12 07:08:37
Yeah and who is going to determine which transactions to block? Who is going to create blacklists and decide what gets censored, you??

Actually no. Users don't decide in uasf it's Sybil resistant so users mean nothing only that fuzzy "Economic majority" matters. That means only nodes with economic weight like the ones from exchanges and payment processors etc that can make miners lose money. As far as I know no big player in that field has yet expressed support for uasf and one of the biggest (bitpay) has already said they won't support it.
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:59:04

@_date: 2017-04-25 05:01:36
Does that mean that a hashrate attack against core chain is justified in case of a split? It's kind of hypocritical to celebrate attacks on competing software and condemn attacks on your software.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:39:07
Yet there's no way to gauge the support uasf will have from economically relevant nodes after the fact, if shit hits the fan and the chain is attacked or whatever. I've seen arguments about how economic majority nodes will in the end protect their wealth above all choosing the stronger chain (hashrate) and arguments about how miners will protect their revenue by supporting segwit blocks. What I'm not so sure is which one will be.
@_date: 2017-04-22 03:57:02
That was only true at the beginning  probably until the crash and subsequent instant recovery after the first silk road disappeared years ago.

The've coded that software and they don't owe you the right to modify it into a competing fork. If you don't like it don't use it if you want to have other features or they stop developing it, just don't use it and develop your own code. When talking about a bitcoin wallet from the user perspective it's open source for everything that matters which is being able to review the code and make sure there's nothing malicious in there.
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:35:36
But that value of those economic nodes is secured by miners, so if their chain ends up with low hashrate and very long block times until the next difficulty adjustment or even being attacked then they loose that value or they can even chose the other chain for pragmatic purposes, no? This is the part I'm having difficulty understanding.
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:52:09

No. Segwit does not deploy bigger blocks, if it did it wouldn't be compatible with old nodes, period. It gives us more tx storage capacity in the same small blocks ergo a real block size increase to 2mb will deliver 2x Segwit capacity 2x miner fees (throwing them a bone and making BU dead on arrival) which is what I personally think needs to happen even if it's not perfect because it's safer than the alternative BU HF and UASF chain split.
As for the existing economic majority being prepared we know for a fact that no big player supports UASF and that segwit won't activate under current conditions so that statement is kind of meaningless unless something changes.

The movement usually starts in one exchange by one buyer or group of buyers, what happens is that a lot of trading bots start following that movement buying themselves and amplifying the movement other bots immediately cancel their sell others and place them higher in different exchanges where other bots are also buying to arbitrage the price difference which lasts sometimes less than a second then humans also jump in amplifying the trend.
Of course a single big buy won't cause this always it's just when the time is right, here we had a lot of technical indicators after a period of stability pointing to a imminent big move and bots and humans were ready to follow it fast the moment it materialized.

No I'm not wrong, but for simplicity when I mentioned BASE58, I was actually referring to the sha256 x2 that happens to calculate the checksum just before the Base58 encoding in bitcoin (not to confuse with the RIPEMD+SHA256 that is performed at the beginning on the public key)
So this:
    RIPEMD160(SHA256(PUB_KEY))    
Produces 20bytes, which then go through this to calculate the checksum:
    SHA256(SHA256(20bytes))
The result of that hash is our checksum, **4 bytes** of which are appended to the original 20bytes just before the Base58 encoding.
    BASE58(20bytes+4bytes)
So my point was that the irreversible sha256x2 hashing used to calculate the checksum before the Base58 encoding makes it impossible to change just one character of an address and end up with a valid address.

In the end wether talking about miners or economic majority power has a tendency to centralize, to gravitate towards big players that try absorb or destroy competition.

Yes you are missing something. The fact that you are right. Hashrate alone doesn't have an impact on price. If has go down in many occasions and the difficulty has been negatively adjusted many times without any impact on price.
What's going on now however is that many have the perception that the bcash war could affect bitcoin real or not (personally I think it has very little real impact) there's a negative sentiment in the middle of a harsh bear market. And you know what that leads to.

As people have explained to you in the thread it's impossible to change just one character since all addresses have an embedded checksum, changing just one character will make the address invalid and the transaction will be invalid and rejected.

People hoarding bitcoin are the ones that pushed the price to where it is now which is the main reason more people are drawn to this world. If it wasn't for the price it'll be still a niche technology.

Have you considered the fact that in 2009 the price of storing 1MB of data was 4 or 5 times more expensive than today? Do you really think storing 2MB sized blocks in fucking 2017 is going to hurt decentralization more than the shitstorm this blockade an civil war has already created? are you aware of the amount of people that no longer run core nodes because of this. You will stop being able to enforce bitcoins social contract the moment you choke the network to a point that people start running altcoin nodes instead of bitcoin nodes. The amount of nodes we have lost due to this for profit companies like AXA choking the network is an order of magnitude bigger than the effect of a reasonable conservative increase proportional to storage prices over time.
The proponents that most of the bitcoin transactions should happen on the off-chain permissioned ledgers run by for profit companies so that they can collect the fees intended for miners are the ones selling out the decentrilzed trustless nature of an electronic peer 2 peer cash system.

No. Changing just one character makes the whole address invalid and the checksum can't be changed because its added earlier in the process to the public key and then hashed using BASE58 to produce the actual Bitcoin address which means that all characters in an address are linked together and derived from the pubkey+checksum and since hashing is a one way function it's impossible to find a fake checksum that will produce your wrong address with just one character different and that's why we have random addresses in Bitcoin instead of custom ones.

Confiscating miners allows them to have control of the bitcoin network, the can silently revert transactions if they want with 60% of the hashrate or block specific transactions from ever confirming and orphaning blocks from other miners if they confirm it. 
Why on earth wouldn't the most draconian and controlling communist government not try to control bitcoin having as they do they keys to the kingdom in the form of 60% of the current hashrate. That's what I worry about.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:08:00
Are you completely clueless or what? The system is not decentralized it has 60% of the hashrate concentrated in China if they confiscate mines there they own the network, they can orphan all the blocks you mine outside China and include none of your transactions which will require an emergency fork to change POW and you as a miner will be fucked.

You won't be able to send legacy BTC anywhere if it doesn't have hashrate unlike s2x. Are you implying that miners are bluffing or what? If they are not I don't see how the legacy chain can survive with 10% hashrate.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:13:04
Yes but we are discussing a scenario where there is no drop in hashrate because the mines keep running although under the control of the government so the difficulty stays the same and there is no economic incentive or time to other foreign miners to compete.

That doesn't make sense, they won't dilute their reward Satoshi intended for them to follow the economic incentive and they are paid by the network not by venture capital.

Actually an airgaped offline encrypted android phone can have better security than a hardware wallet. A fresh install on a phone that has no simcard and it's not connected whatsoever to the internet.
1.- Completely airgaped operation, you don't need to trust USB firmware to be safe or free of NSA level exploits unlike hardware wallets.
- You create unsigned transactions with whatever online device and encode it to a QR code.
- You scan the QR code with you offline android phone sign the transaction and encode it to QR code on the screen of the phone
- You scan the signed transaction with the webcam of the online computer and broadcast.
2.- plausible deniability, it's just an android phone a hardware wallet is recognizable nowadays by airport security or kidnappers or whatever.
3.- steganography, you don't need to store your private keys in plain sight they could be generated from the hash of a picture from the phone or embedded in the metadata of an mp3 stored among thousands of mp3s or boring family pictures stored on the phone. You can just generate the pvt keys from your steganogrphically hidden seed on the fly to sign a TX and then delete them, no need for any bitcoin software on the phone just the offline html file of the coinb.in website hidden among android files to sign your TX.
4.- More options to password protect the device including biometric and passphrases although as per point 3 compromising the device password won't necessarily compromise your pvt key.

Hi why do you think b2x won't live long?
The general argument here is that hashrate follows price so miners are bluffing and will stay mining the legacy chain, but at the same time they argue that bitcoin cash has value because EDA attracks miners but this is the exact opposite argument.
So, if b2x starts working fine with 85% hashrate and the legacy chain slows to a crawl why wouldn't traders which doesn't care about politics dump legacy in favor of b2x reinforcing the incentive to mine b2x?

You can't open up and read the Flash memory of an encrypted phone at least from the newest models, the phone also wipes itself after a brute force attempt and a passphrase like the one you can use on a phone offers much more security than an 8 digit pin. I agree about the fingerprint.
Also remember that reading the Flash gets you nowhere since your private key isn't there on the phone, it's maybe the hash of a picture or steganographically hidden between the thousands of files on the phone and the phone had no bitcoin software so 100% plausible deniability unlike a trezor.

What a paranoid world you live in where everyone that disagrees with you on a technical aspect of a spam limit is an evil being trying to do harm to bitcoin (even though it goes against their own interest to harm it) longtime bitcoin devs, companies, miners...

This doesn't make any sense, the credibility of the system comes from its tech, who invented it is irrelevant.

Yeah except the argument against b2x is that hashrate follows price so if EDA keeps alive bitcoin cash it means it's the other way around and people are buying bitcoin cash for its hashrate which paints a bright future for b2x.
An no, it's not possible to create a $300 artificial floor for so long regardless if you are jihan, roger or the pope. So bitcoin cash is a very interesting case and quite remarkable despite the hate and the calls for 0 value over here once exchanges gave access to their customers bitcoin cash.

Yes I do think miners follow. They'll follow coinbase, bitpay etc and their millions of customers not so long ago the UASF crowd were praising the power of the *economic majority* and now somehow that gets brushed off. The giving away power statement is an ambivalent one that the r/btc crowd can use when referring to blockstream etc. To an outsider it might seem like you have to give away your power either to miners or VC funded developers.
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:22:36
Why would you want to skip the QR part since it's the one that provides the security. The host computer of the VM can be infected which might expose your pvt key when you use the VM. Qubes is connected to the internet so your pvt is not cold when your are using Qubes and connected to the internet. The QR method is the only one where your pvt key is 100% cold all the time thanks to the airgap.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:46:24
No you do not need any program. The html from the site coinb.in is enough to sign a TX so you can just load to the offline device that html file (which is just a simple txt file really) via QR code if you want so your offline device can sign TX without downloading any program or touching the internet whatsoever.

I don't think it's a fair comparison, this hack had nothing to do with the bitstamp one were no customer funds were affected, the scale and the uncertainty the days after the hack and the loss we have suffered (although less than expected) is something really difficult to forget.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:59:41
Quite the contrary. If they nationalize the mines with 60%+ of hashrate they can manipulate the blockchain at will and bitcoin will no longer serve any purpose, other nations won't bother because bitcoin the trustless permissionless currency will cease to exist which is what a government like that will like. Of course we can always change the POW etc, but it's a scary scenario.

No you do not.
You create your unsigned transaction safely online you encode it to a QR code and scan it with your offline airgaped computer/phone with your private keys. You sign the transaction and encode the signed transaction to a QR code, you now scan the QR code with the signed transaction with your online computer and broadcast the transaction. Done. More security than a hardware wallet since it's completely airgapped and you avoid NSA level exploits against USB firmware.

Your bitcoin address will be credited immediately when the fork happens, cold storage devices just store the private key they are like a glorified password keepers. So the moment the fork happens your bitcoin address will have B2X the update to firmware is only needed to be able to spend it easily. But even without a firmware update you can access your B2X with your 12 word seed.

I'm not sure I follow, we both know that 60% of the hashrate of the network is in China soil at the fingertips of their government, right? Which means that they can seize it a perform a 51% attack completely free, they are the only government currently that can do this and they are not a democracy.
So why exactly are you not concerned about this exactly and what does the media have to do with the fact that 60% of the hashrate is there?

This is true but anecdotal. Nothing guarantees it and it depends on the exchange some like bitmex didn't credit BCH at all and many did many months later when the price was lower. The only foolproof way to do it is having your BTC on a wallet.

Yes and you can also taint your coins with inputs that are already split but for all practical purposes the coins are stuck and it's a huge risk to the regular users, not experts to send to an address you don't control.

I do think that before that happens one of the chains will die.

What more detail do you want? If you own Bitcoin before the fork, once the fork happens your bitcoin address will have both coins instantly. Having bitcoin on an exchange is NOT owning Bitcoin so you'll have to withdraw to your own wallet if you have bitcoin on an exchange.

There are many people here unfortunately that can't afford not to sell below 10k because they were using money they couldn't afford to lose in the first place.

They are not trying to force anything. Economic sovereignty means they can run whatever software they want the same as you. Segwit2x has consensus from the miners and a significant part of the economic majority, something not trivial. On the other hand we have some nodes and people on social media against it which unfortunately we can't measure in a Sybil resistant manner to gauge how much "consensus" they represent really.

Some people use very hyperbolic language here beware. Segwit2x is an upgrade to the amount of transactions the network can process that some people think it's s threat to decentralization and other bad things on the other hand a lot of respected companies and the miners almost unanimously think it's better for the network. I urge you to read the arguments for both stances and form your own opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:17:30
First of all miners can mine at a loss short term if it means a massive win medium/long term for them, they are not short sighted robots. Second a blockchain that doesn't confirm blocks is not profitable. Period. If 95% of miners stick to their commitment they define what blockchain is profitable. So the only question here is if they are bluffing or not.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:28:07
You can't. At least currently, either Core or S2X have to implement  replay protection on their chain. Doing so implies that your coin is the lesser one so both might be stubborn not to do it. If they don't do it then one of the chains has to die, so the upcoming scenario is way more complicated than Bitcoin Cash and what people think.
@_date: 2018-07-21 07:26:45

Nah not really, almost everyone cares about decentralization, there's no technical evidence a meager 2MB block in 2018 is a greater threat to decentralization than a network with fees that are worth a week salary in countries like Venezuela. There's a lot of technical discussion that needs to take place and trying to shutdown, exile or destroy anyone that disagrees with you does not help decentralization actually.
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:26:36

No it doesn't. Bitcoin gold will have strong replay protection. Unlike S2X they are not trying to become bitcoin they are just a fork with different features than bitcoin so they have no problem implementing replay protection.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:28:26
As miners cease mining difficulty drops which makes mining more profitable until it finds equilibrium, difficulty can drop to when bitcoin was at $500 and the network will still be working perfectly fine. In fact if those datacenter miners get burned difficulty will drop so much I might fire up my old 28nm ASICs.

@_date: 2017-10-07 06:20:10
No it will not. The only difference is that if you keep your coins in cold storage you are guaranteed to get both coins if you deposit then on coinbase you have to trust them to give you both coins. There's no logical reason to do so, keep them on cold storage.

Nodes are not a Sybil resistant way of measuring support, anyone can fire a couple thousand nodes with some mouse clicks. In fact UASF disregarded node count for that reason.

Ok so very quick summary with some approximations so you get the idea.
Bitcoin is a digital currency and a payment network combined. Like dollars and PayPal combined. Unlike dollars they are not created by any government in fact the system runs autonomously without employees or infrastructure of its own. It runs distributed in thousands of computers around the world which means it cannot be easily shut down and since it runs autonomously governed by a computer program it can't be sued either.
So think about it, it's like a global currency devoid of human error/manipulators/corruption etc a system with fixed rules that no one can manipulate including a fixed supply of units 21 million bitcoins forever for all humanity unlike other currencies no one can mint more than those 21 million units, it's the first deflationary currency.
In order to store your bitcoins you need what's called a wallet. This is like a program you install in your computer/mobile that allows you to store, send and receive bitcoin you also have little USB devices that do the same in a more secure way (immune to viruses) called hardware wallets (lookup trezor or ledger nano). You buy bitcoins by opening an account in companies that sells them like Coinbase for example or from other users and then you store them in your wallet. Its price is whatever the global market of buyers/sellers find they are worth, there's no central authority like a central bank that can manipulate its price.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:44:46
Yes I know but that is irrelevant, having to scan and send your passport over the internet to get verified on them and losing control of your private keys temporarily isn't a scalable or viable enough way to split millions of coins for regular users IMO.

To your bitcoin address. Your bitcoin address will have both coins instantly the moment the fork happens. If you have a Trezor you do have a bitcoin address so you will receive the coins instantly. If you have your coins on your account on Coinbase or any other exchange you DO NOT have a bitcoin address and wether your receive the new coins or not and when depends on Coinbase.
Having your bitcoins on a trezor is like having cash on your physical wallet, you own it a no one can touch it.
Having bitcoins on an account on Coinbase or any other exchange is like having money on a bank you own your money just in theory, the bank or government can freeze your funds any time.
Withdrawing your bitcoins from coinbase to your trezor is like going to an ATM and withdrawing money from your bank account to your wallet. You need the bitcoins in your wallet yo receive the new coins, not in the "bank".

What a bullshit title, that you're able to write shit in the blockchain is a feature not a vulnerability.
Yes you could send tens of thousands of transactions and write some lines of code on each of them so that some malware could retrieve them, which should be the most inefficient way of doing that when you can just upload your whole malware payload to a bulletproof ISP server like malware developers have been doing since forever, or to your own server behind tor.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:04:32
The difference is that if you have BTC in coinbase you don't really have BTC, coinbase controls it and you won't receive the new coin after the fork at least not until coinbase decides to credit you the new coin which is not a sure thing either. If you have bitcoin on your hardware key you really own it and you'll receive the new coin instantly.

Running with the money makes absolutely 0 sense in this context. This isn't a DNM were everyone is anonymous and already committing a crime (in the eyes of the law). This is a legitimate business, the owners are well known in the community, they've been speakers at conferences etc. You underestimate how difficult it is to launder that amount of tainted coins with all eyes on your addresses, when even exchanges are tracking you so you don't cash out with them (even btce did this with the Agora coins). I don't see the incentive in having to live hiding like a rat in some island like that, when you can just live a good lucrative life as the CEO of a successful company.

Miners depreciate both for rich a poor people so that cancels out in comparison with PoS. PoW is not a free market to enter, you have initial cost and the need to burn electricity even with the shitiest cheapest miner in order to allocate hashpower, so no, not anyone can allocate hashpower, far from it.


As explained above the fact that miners never depreciate means that the "miners" of the poor never depreciate either so that cancels out and the rich get richer in both systems in the same proportion. Buying at an ICO at least creates buying pressure on the coin you are investing. Filling the pockets of Bitmain or Nvidia is the same as buying at an ICO since you have to buy from them or you are fucked but with no benefit for the coin you are investing in.

A futures contract is just a bet between two parties about the price of Bitcoin at a specified time in the future, in the case of this contract each day at 12 GMT.
So if the price of the contract right know is $240 and I buy a contract (called going long) it means I'm betting that the price by 12 GMT will be higher than $240. On the other hand the guy that sold me the contract (went short) is betting the opposite, he thinks Bitcoin will go down by 12 GMT.
So at 12 GMT the bet is settled and the losing party has to pay the difference between the current price and the $240 price that the contract had when it was traded. So if for example at 12 GMT Bitcoin price is $250 the guy that went short (sold the contract) has to pay the guy that went long (bought the contract) $10 bucks.
50x leverage means that the exchange lends you 50 times the money you have to make the bet, so if for example you have $10 they'll lend you $40 and now you can make a $50 bet.

Hi I'm sorry but this is mostly bullshit. It's all about the money. It always is. The war cry of the politicians that encouraged blind nationalism was "Espanya ens roba" (Spain steals from us) since they are a rich region like Madrid that pay more taxes than money they receive due to solidarity with poorer regions. The creators of that movement the "Molt honorable" Mr Pujol turns out was taking bribes of 3% for any public contract in Catalonia until it was found he was hiding a fortune in Andorra and was charged and with him all his sons that had also fortunes which they can't explain their origins... So talk about corruption... In the end the easy way forward for a politician is to find a strawman enemy and blame everything on them in this case Spain. As for lack of separation of powers the same judges that indicted the corrupt Catalan politicians also indicted the political party that governs Spain now they even embargo their headquarters for illegal financing so that's bullshit.
42% of participation is a joke when the vote it's illegal and organized by pro independence people and the votes counted by pro independence people in the floor of a church with 0 guarantees. It was just a charade, it's 2 million people trying to force this on a region where 5.5 million people live, the majority pro independence parties have on their parliament isn't even enough to change tax laws but to approve something as crazy as this it's enough thanks to the illegal ad hoc pro independence laws they came up with.
The police took away ballot boxes because they were illegal they didn't attack voters, pro independence people tried to get in the way of the police to get those pictures they blocked and jumped on the hood of police cars (can you imagine that happening on Texas and police doing nothing?), you see laws are not elastic where you only respect the ones you like, you have to respect all of them in any country.

When a fork happens a new network is created. In that new network all existing balances from the original network are duplicated, so if you own a bitcoin address like with a hardware wallet, after the fork you will have your bitcoin address in both networks with coins on both of them. You don't really received anything it's just that now there's a new network where you also have a balance cloned from the balance you had on the original network before the fork.
To make an analogy imagine you have a $10 bill on your wallet. When a fork happens it's not like you wake up to two $10 bills on your wallet, it's more like you wake up to two wallets one with the original $10 bill and another new one with another $10 bill.
In order to be able to spend your new coins after the fork trezor should push for a firmware update so you can send either of them safely, or you can do it by hand but it's more difficult to explain.

BIP49 includes accounts and different derivation paths other than default it's part of the specification. Other wallets that claim to support BIP49 also support those accounts since it's part of the BIP49.
You only support BIP49 PARTIALLY not fully, accounts different than default ARE PART of the BIP49 which your wallet lacks making it INCOMPATIBLE with ledger BIP49 accounts 1,2,3 etc. for example.
Sorry for the caps but your lie is extremely dangerous for people with ledgers that read it and don't know that importing the seed in samourai means they won't be able to access funds on any of their accounts other than default despite the claims that your wallet is compatible.

Coinbase =plain IP=&gt; Your BTC wallet =VPN IP=&gt; Shapeshift =&gt; Dash =VPN IP (different server)=&gt; Bitfinex =&gt; BTC =&gt; New BTC wallet
The reason is that using the same IP to withdraw to shapeshit from Coinbase is unsafe, and specially using the same service to buy and sell dark (dash) since they know your IP and browser fingerprint so even if the blockchain trail is broken Shapeshift knows it's the same user and the same approximate quantity, so better to use another service that doesn't require verification like bitfinex.

Not even close. The purchasing power of a Greek is measured by the amount of milk he can buy in Greece with his euros, not the amount he can buy in Minnesota. In fact the euros were gaining so much purchasing power that we entered deflation and THAT IS THE DAMN REASON why Draghi is purposefully trying to stop them gaining value with Quantitative Easing, to get us out of deflation.


YOU are the one that chose the time frame, you're speaking about the CURRENT situation of the Euro, and likewise I was speaking about the current situation of bitcoin, if some Greek is going to consider either currency as a store of value it's present situation is what matters.


My point here is that a merchant requires the same amount of Euros to buy a liter of milk to feed your family now and a year ago regardless of their price against the dollar, whereas now any merchant that accepts bitcoins requires MUCH more bitcoins now for the same product than a year ago.

To be honest I rather have Core in charge of development, but that being said I don't think a tiny increase of an obsolete spam limit to 2MB in 2018 deserves this amount of hatred and I don't think most users care or are opposed to that specific technicality, I do prefer 2MB but I rather stay with 1MB and no hardfork.
That being said, until those companies are made really redundant by **user friendly/noob accesible** blockchain technology something I doubt will happen that soon companies like Coinbase and Shapeshift provide an extremely useful noob friendly way for people to start using bitcoin, they have hundreds of thousands of customers and they are responsible for a lot of adoption so yeah I think their support is important and that they shouldn't be vilified. That's my honest opinion.

Also the card doesn't have holder name or electronic chip (a problem where I live).

Above all, Satoshi's vision was about making bitcoin open source and all that this implies.
There's no "new" or "old" users, there's just users of bitcoin, and they too have put their hard earned money in this. No one is forcing you to go against your interpretation of Satoshi's vision, but if the majority of bitcoin users decide to go in another direction because they can and because that's what the open source nature of this project is about, you might be the one stuck on an alt-coin after all.
I'm actually in favor of what you call satoshi's vision btw, but I really dislike the messianic tone interpreting what satoshi's vision was so there can't be any discussion because otherwise we "wreck" bitcoin...

I didn't dismiss your thinking as bullshit in fact quite the contrary it's the first time you made a sound argument instead of insulting respectable businesses just because you disagree with them and downplaying them as "some malcontent minority paid by Roger, shills bla bla, (which is what I was calling bullshit)"
And I do agree with everything you said, and it will be true if bandwidth and storage prices where a constant since 10 years ago. But they are not. They are an **order of magnitude** bigger now that we get closer to 2020 and all those features that bitcoin had with 1MB blocks in 2010 it will absolutely have with 2MB blocks in 2020. It's a way bigger risk censoring access to the bitcoin network via outrageous fees to a significant part of the population than what any firewall can do to tiny 2MB packets of data every 10mins.
And yes I do agree about the fact that there's a reason why most of the engineers in this space (not yet banned or forcefully removed) and in that company that just released a patent on sidechain technologies for their **for paid** services don't want to increase the blocksize a tiny bit, I just don't think it has anything to do with scaling or it being risky.

First of all Google does take words out of your emails, not one or two but all of them to sell them to advertisers. There's no free transfers unless you deal with Bitcoin end to end, the moment you start dealing with fiat it doesn't matter if you use your own internal settlement like Neteller does or the blockchain, in both cases you need to deal with banks and pay their fees at the entry and exit points.
So, now that skrill and neteller offer free money transfers between their users and sparing me the buzz words, what exactly is Circle bringing to the table different than those free money transfers?, why do they even need Bitcoin now?

How is this different to send him coins from an exchange?.
- No one solo mines, therefore when you're part of a pool you receive part of the reward distributed by the pool, the pool has the logs of all their miners with their historical IP addresses the Bitcoin addresses they withdraw to etc.
- An exchange like bitfinex that doesn't require verification for crypto, has the same information that a pool operator, mainly your IP address and logs, coins originating from the cold storage of a big exchange are equally untraceable as newly minted coins.
The only exception here will be a p2p pool, where you still leave an IP trail when you connect to other peers and submit shares.
So basically you're risking being caught in both cases by your IP address (or if you use a vpn if it failed you just one time) if the pool/exchange gets a  subpoena not by the coin trail, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:19:51

The mining chip connects to 21 Inc mining pool, it doesn't actually generate any Bitcoin unless it finds a block by itself (extremely unlikely), 21 inc sends out Bitcoin depending on the shares it contributed and the luck of the pool. So effectively they fall under the scenario where they are sending money directly to the device.
So the question is. If you're going to send Bitcoin to the device from your centralized corporate mining servers why don't scrap the mining chip and send it Bitcoin, most of this chips won't ever find a block by themselves so this is what they are doing, sending them Bitcoin from their servers.

In a tizzy? In the last year and a half Bitcoin has dropped 80% in value since it's ATH. Following an obvious trend is a rational trading strategy in any market, I know people here take that personally which is a little infantile I think. I know I'm gonna get downvoted I do love Bitcoin but I can't blame traders that made the right call. Also squeezed shorts might be fuel if this thing finally reverses at some point.

As a miner participating in PoW, it absolutely matters how rich you are (= hashpower you can afford) in the same proportion as your stash matters in PoS in order to define your influence.
That should be obvious to anyone with a little understanding of economics.
It doesn't matter if the rich stash their money in a staking wallet or the do so buying noisy ASIC machines, the net outcome is the same. Your influence on the network depends on the capital you have in the same proportion in regards to the rest of the participants on the network.

No, as long as the time of the lock hasn't arrived you can change and update the transaction. So you can make the transaction locked for say one year and before it reaches that year broadcast a new one for another year and so on.

Because they are connected all of them to the centralized servers of 21 inc they don't interact with the Bitcoin network directly they just connect to 21 Inc which has full control over them regardless if they are physically located on your garage or on their datacenters, 21 Inc receives all the bitcoins generated by these devices and they distribute them how they see fit and there's nothing you can do aside from turning them off. How is that decentralized?? It's not. It's just a mesh of computers geographically distributed but completely under the control of a centralized entity.

If you say so...
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:01:19
No there is not. As it turns out bottoms are determined by buyers not sellers. If no one want's to buy your mined coins at your break even price, then you're forced to sell them at a loss because that is at least better than nothing. And if you can withhold them instead of selling them at a loss, other miners in more complicated situations will sell them.
Buyers don't give a rats ass about your cost to mine a bitcoin, and in a free falling scenario miners will race to the bottom selling at a loss to at least be able to recoup something. Fortunately I think a lot of fundamentals will keep btc price above a level that makes it worth it for some miners with cheap power and efficient enough hardware.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:14:14

You just don't get it.
It's about traders and speculators.
Litecoin is worth shit fundamentally, but speculative it's supported by major exchanges and it's moves are way more profitable to small time traders than the moves of Bitcoin. If you have 1 Bitcoin (245$) and it moves up 10$ you made 10$. At the same time since each litecoin is worth so little it's movements are more dramatic if you have $245 worth of litecoin and it moves from $3 to $4 you made $245 and it recently went from $2 to $8 pretty quickly imagine the amount of money and excitement traders lost/gain there.
Of course everyone knows that it's worth shit but as long as you can make money off of it people will continue speculating with it.
@_date: 2015-10-07 05:49:03

Because under non-anarchy you face consequences, the monopoly of violence you speak of won't steal my whole banana only part of it (taxes) and it's predictable on its rules unlike an anarchist monopoly of violence based only on who's stronger.


As the son of an immigrant woman with no resources that thrived thanks to the universal healthcare and public schooling of my country I see the taxes I pay now as giving back helping the weaker, not stealing.


The only ones ruling with perfect immunity are the stronger ones over the weaker ones in a society without rules.


In order to solve a dispute you need a judge, an authority of some sort otherwise is back to who is stronger. And that is the key point here, you can't organize a society with out a mechanism to solve disputes which inherently means that you need to give power to someone over others a "monopoly of violence" like you call it.
@_date: 2015-10-19 07:10:16
As someone told you it's the malleability attack. Don't worry, your bitcoins are safe and arrived at their intended destination. They only thing this attack does is it changes the ID of the transaction, but the transaction itself (source address, number of bitcoins, and destination address) remains the same, your wallet got confused because of this, but if you check the receiving address you'll see that it received your bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:57:29

The traders that created this roller coaster haven't even withdraw from exchanges and don't give a fuck about having to add temporarily a couple more cents to get into a block. I'm all for a block size increase but this is just speculators going wild it has nothing to do with technical aspects of the network.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:14:23
There is no UASF + later hard fork plan. Only Silberts proposal said something like that and core doesn't support it.
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:57:23
No. It's about routing. Coinkite services are located in both cases on their own servers outside the US apparently.
But, when you type coinkite address on your browser you are first sent to cloudfare servers, they check that your traffic is legit and then they relay it to coinkite servers whose location/ip is kept secret.
On the other hand when you access coinkite through TOR, you don't go through cloudfare, you reach coinkite servers directly whose location is protected in this case by the TOR network.

@_date: 2017-05-30 19:35:56
No it hasn't. No one was coerced or bullied into segwit in those alt coins since it wasn't a contentious upgrade for them. A massive amount of hashrate and a significant amount of companies have committed to a different proposal than UASF so bullying and coercing others won't work here, it doesn't work like that for miners to push for a hard fork and neither it will for the guys with the hats.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:45:44
You or a million users signalling to UASF in their card board Pi nodes is completely irrelevant since UASF is not a sybil attack where node count matters. So I wasn't referring to that, but to the actual bullying that's going on, spamming exchanges Twitter accounts and support systems to try to coerce them to support something the clearly don't want to, just read the FrontPage of this sub.

Why is he obtuse exactly? An initiative that needs economic majority support and hashrate has neither so I think the question is relevant.
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:28:52
You can say that segwit itself with its lack of traction is a passing thing based on the same arguments you use to say XT/C/U are passing things.
It's more complex than that. Many people think that we need bigger blocks and that the fact that the most prominent developers are employed by a company that needs sidechains to succeed creates a conflict of interest. You may or may not agree with this but C/XT/U are a manifestation of this reality and it's not going away. I do think this divide is more rooted in poor PR and ego battles rather than really technical impossibility to find a compromise solution by both sides.

The amount of bitcoins that miners get for each block they mine gets cut in half. This cuts in half the current inflation rate of Bitcoin (not the current supply as people say) which means that even after the halving we need a constant increase in demand to absorb inflation, some people expect this demand to surpass inflation and drive the price up. Others think that maybe Bitcoin is stagnant right now adoption wise and that the demand that absorbs our current inflation comes from people speculating on the halvening so when the time comes it'll be factored in the price already.

You see, you assumed that the way to profit from trading is just buying low selling high but this couldn't be farther from the truth there's another 50% of the equation you left out. You can also win big by selling high and buying low you profit on the way down on futures or exchanges that offer margin, basically you're selling borrowed bitcoin using some collateral as guarantee.
So let's imagine the little anarchist just bought bitcoin in order to protect his capital from the cruel government when suddenly a Chinese speculator in a futures exchange shorts bitcoin, starts selling like there's no tomorrow the price goes down 9% and the little anarchist loses 9% of his capital while his speculator master wins big.

The 80k BTC value in pending transactions can come from a really small amount of big transactions that given their priority will get included in the next block anyway.
It's just a spam attack, notice that I can create thousands of Bitcoin transactions with just one USD cent, so for the average Bitcoin user that uses an updated wallet this means nothing his fees are calculated by the wallet so that his transaction gets included in the next block there is effectively no backlog whatsoever for him.
You don't say that you have a huge backlog of unread emails just because your spam folder is full of penis enlargement pills unread emails, you just refer to your inbox. So the Bitcoin inbox in this analogy is fine it's just our spam folder that's getting big.
Even if the cumulative fees of the spam transactions seem big it isn't actually worth the blockchain space they take so miners and even nodes ignore them, they literally filter them out so they don't bloat their mempool.

Is there any technical reason why an obsolete spam limit can't be increased when it's clearly necessary regardless of the also necessary layer 2 solutions? No there isn't, no 2MB in 2018 won't hurt decentralization, yes a hard fork is always dangerous but never as much as a contentious chain split.

Bitcoin might not be a moral space but I was hopping it'll be a rational one at least. These bullshit pitchfork hunt against honest companies that is coming from r/btc and people like you (you at least have this in common) for trying to find a compromise, even if you think they are wrong is complete nonsense. They might be wrong but they didn't ally or side with "greedy miners" or run BU that is just pitchfork talk. Segwit+2mb in 2018 is not a threat to centralization at all neither it is on-chain microtx support that is just bullshit and you know it, bumping the spam limit satoshi put in place to a meager 2mb and then using layer 2 for small tx is NOT large scale on-chain low volume microtx that's just a lie.
I respect people that don't like the agreement based on technical reasons regarding activation and in my case the lack of support from developers but what you say is just not true and I don't think these companies that are a key part of the economic majority people keep taking about should be boycotted for political reasons.

Right at this moment the price at kraken for buying with EUR is 217.59 and bit2me pays you 213.75 when selling to them.
Check for yourself clicking sell at their website, their price isn't pegged with any exchange AFAIK so it depends. In general pretty low spread, sometimes even less than the fees of my regular credit card when withdrawing from a different ATM.
@_date: 2015-10-07 11:33:19
You don't event need to arrange anything online, as long as you've got bitcoins on your smartphone you're good to go.
Your plane lands in Spain, while getting out of the plane you open the bit2me app on your smartphone enter the amount of EUR you want, the app tells you the amount of bitcoins you've to pay and it asks for a phone number, you click and you pay them using your regular mobile wallet. You immediately receive (0 confirmations!!) a pin number via SMS to the mobile phone number you provided, you go to any of the supported ATMs, you enter the PIN number and it gives you EUR. Period. It's instant no credit card or anything, just a bitcoin wallet and a mobile phone number.
You have a supported ATM at the airport by the way, oh and you can also share the bitcoin paying address if you don't have a bitcoin wallet and anyone can pay from anywhere to that address (maybe a relative in other country) and you'll be able to withdraw your euros.
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:27:57
Yeah sort of, also merchants or anyone that receives transactions needs to prepare to deal with incoming malleated transactions, but since the bitcoins always arrive it's more an annoyance than a real problem.
Having a full copy of the blockchain doesn't help, lite and full wallets are affected the same, both transactions (original and malleated) are identical, valid and spend the same legit bitcoins it's just a matter of which one will get included in a block by a miner first.
By the way, this is the work of a single Russian guy, and patches to Bitcoin core are already being worked on to minimize this issue.

SEPA only works between EU countries, the recipient needs a bank account etc. I send regularly from outside the EU to Spain and I get charged a lot in fees, plus I have to wait days! or use a high fee method like WU.
Compare that to this:
The intended recipient of my remittance opens his bit2me app in his smartphone and types the amount of EUR he needs, the app gives him a btc address to pay, he shares it with me (I'm on the other side of the world) I pay, immediately after I pay (0 confirmations required!!) he withdraws EUR from the nearest ATM without needing ID or a credit card or anything, just the pin code the app gives him when it detects a btc payment. The whole exchange maybe took 60 seconds.
I'm not saying you are wrong about other countries or that Spain doesn't have a smaller remittance problem compared to them, I'm just saying that thanks to this service its extremely efficient, cheap and convenient to send money to any part of Spain or Romania now.
Oh and of course maybe the sender has to buy bitcoins (not my case) but this I admit will add an extra step, but nowadays thankfully we have very easy ways to buy them.

Wrong. The CFTC went after TeraExchange not Bitfinex, for offering non deliverable derivatives (actual swaps that fall under CFTC supervision) and they reached a settlement with them. Bitfinex used the word swaps but since you can claim the underlying when closing a position (deliverable) they are not really swaps under CFTC definition, to avoid confusion the changed the name to margin funding. They also contacted themselves the CFTC just in case.

@_date: 2017-05-30 12:30:03
I'm sorry but I can't make sense of most of your points.
You said we are gaining support, but aside from irrelevant node count (UASF is Sybil resistant) this sub and the guys wearing hats on twitter do we have actual hashrate or exchange/payment processor support?
Transactions being a little slow is kind of an understatement, transactions are slow now, the mempool situation with 60% less hashrate could be a shitshow impossible to deal with for businesses. The logic that since the legacy chain will be working better and faster people will dump it for a choking chain doesn't make any sense.
The argument that I should be bullied to accept BIP148 because it's happening anyway is the exact same reason why I refuse a contentious hardfork when miners bully us by telling it's inevitable.
So I'm more lost now than ever regarding bip148.

Bitcoin isn't mainstream simply because its still difficult even dangerous to use to most non tech people and because it doesn't really have any advantages to normal people over their current payment networks, it has nothing to do with the current tps which at this stage is just a technical discussion.
And just to be clear I obviously want the blocksize increased ASAP.

There's also a non trivial risk that the new chain without significant hashrate or explicit exchange support will fail, isn't that so?

Everything sounds dangerously speculative or wishful thinking regarding the chain split.

@_date: 2017-07-31 19:03:19
The books will be as thin or fat as the current amount of regular bitcoins held in the exchanges that support BCC, in case of bitfinex for example this will be quite significant, and people are shorting to get even more BCC that their current BTC/FIAT balances. So yeah, liquidity will matter.

I will not let miners force a hard fork I don't want neither will I let some users with hats force a chain split with no hashrate or industry support on me.

This is NOT true. The code worked flawlessly as intended, this code is written to run on the mainnet, unfortunately the hashrate on the testnet is very low and someone trolled them by adding hashrate and artificially accelerating the HF lock in threshold, something that can't happen in the real mainnet where the code is supposed to run.

No it's you the one that seems to be confused.
Increasing the blocksize does NOT grant me instant transaction functionality, only more tx per block. My transactions with proper fees are **already being included on the next block**, the problem is that it takes 10min to mine one block and around one hour to mine 6 regardless of the blocksize. Do you understand this? 
The choice to trust or use these businesses is mine, I make a living using their services and that's all I care, I don't give a fuck about how benevolent they are or if they also make money, if you don't like them don't use them.
The money I lose waiting for confirmations when the market is moving isn't an artificial problem is a very real for me and many other traders and since increasing the blocksize does not give us instant deposits, how the hell can it be solved without sidechains?

Frankly I think it's much more simple than that. 
Your father has raised you, he built your family, has experience in life etc and that puts him in a position to look up on you a little condescending specially with things he doesn't comprehend which in turn puts him in a defensive position where he associates some of the characteristics of bitcoins with things he does understand and let me tell you sometimes Bitcoin sounds like a scam/joke when you're clueless about what it really is and how it really works.
If you slowly with patience explain to him how cool it is at the protocol level (I'd avoid criticising central banks etc for now) I think he'd eventually get it.
That's how I did it. And last week he bought a plane ticket from expedia with BTC, the expression on his face when scanning the QR code to pay with his mobile wallet was priceless, he felt like Neo lol.

Of course it was a short squeeze, my point is that it was triggered by a whale market buy by KDC. Regardless of MEGA any millionaire can trigger one by market buying some thousands of coins at the right moment on an exchange without circuit-breakers like okcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:35:33
A hardware wallet doesn't hold bitcoins, it just hold their private keys. If bitcoin forks you can use the private keys on your hardware wallet to spend them on both chains by default. You don't need to do anything and you will have your bitcoins on both chains if you had them previous to the split that is.
To access them you just need to import the private key into a wallet compatible with the chain where you want to use them.

It gets better. Due to address reuse and abysmal programming some of the coins being stolen were treated by the mt gox systems as **deposits!!!** that were credited to random accounts and most of the owners of those accounts quickly withdraw them (obviously after winning the lottery) amplifying the loss of bitcoins by Mt gox.

You are getting it back. The worst that can happen is that the site is taken down and you are requested to provide KYC/AML before you can withdraw, but this ain't a hack this is law enforcement and they won't steal customers deposits. As a customer you are not responsible for anything the owners were doing, you just signed up to a service oblivious to what this dude was doing. Not to mention that FinCEN mentioned a 110 million fine to BTC-e and you don't fine a company to then take it down before it can pay.
Most likely scenario in my opinion is that once the dust settles BTC-e will try to come back online and continue operating and in fact since all eyes are on them I don't expect any shenanigans with customers deposits.

It seems that you need to read the whitepaper more than me:
* [...] a sudden crash of BTS value could prevent the system from adjusting in time. In this event, the full amount of collateral is no longer sufficient to purchase the market pegged asset back at the new real exchange rate. In such an event, assets may trade below their face value. It is possible the market could recover if BTS regained value. It is also possible the market would need to be “reset” and asset holders forced to settle for BTS collateral worth less than the intended face value of their assets.*
So, as I was saying, the value in fiat terms of one bitcoin is irrelevant for the protocol unlike bitUSD that relies in the value in fiat terms that speculators give to its collateral for it to not fail.

It's just that the mining chip doesn't make sense regardless of ROI or whatever.
This device connects to 21 Inc servers to submit shares generated by it's mining chip which consumes electricity, generates heat and makes the device more expensive, in turn for the shares it submitted it receives some Bitcoin dust, keep in mind this dust comes from the 21 Inc servers not from the Bitcoin network directly. 21 Inc might as well keep the mining chip in the server farm and let their raspberry pi's connect to them and be given the same amount of Bitcoin dust that the chip will generate.

Anyone can do it unfortunately, you don't even need to be a node.
When you make a transaction based on its parameters an ID is generated to identify it, once you broadcast it unfortunately anyone on the network can take that transaction an modify a small parameter that doesn't change anything relevant from the transaction -except- for it's ID. Then the attacker broadcasts the transaction with the new ID and the Bitcoin network sees two identical transactions with different IDs one of them will get confirmed the other discarded we can't chose which one makes it into a block unfortunately so maybe the transaction with the different ID made by the attacker is the one that gets confirmed. The end result is the same, the transaction is identical to the original one and the bitcoins will arrive at their intended destination but the wallet may get confused since it sees the original transaction as being cancelled.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:17:24
Of course there will always be unconfirmed transactions as some sort of background noise of the network the problem is when a expensive 300 satoshis per byte tx is treated like spam simply because the network is choking.
There's nothing algos can do to improve that, algos can't predict the future so they estimate the fee based on past transactions if a lot of tx arrive at the same time when you send your transaction the estimation is immediately outdated and your tx can get stuck. There's only one solution to that: scaling one way or another.

What a dumb question. Exchanges often have the same price, if you buy at a different exchange you may win money or loose some if at that precise moment the price isn't perfectly equalized which it usually is. 
The fact is that they charge the exact exchange rate of a major exchange with NO FEES.

Since you seem to be a bubble chaser you should focus on its price instead of time for your investments.
Send the money to an exchange an set some limit buy orders at different price levels, in that case you are sure to catch a bubble (if you still believe something like that is likely) as price climbs up and your limit buys are hit your money will turn into BTC riding the bubble up. if price moves down instead your limit buys aren't hit and you keep your money and don't lose anything.
Of course some may say based on the past year that instead of bubbles bitcoin will just experience some fake pumps every now and then on it's downward spiral amid stagnating adoption and huge inflation, which could fuck up this strategy, but it seems that's not your case so I guess this strategy fits your needs.

This isn't like sending bitcoin to some dude that can give it back just like that.

Bitfinexed really??? ������
Yeah I've been in this game a tiny little while also and I've seen some shit. And I know a fudster and a troll like that one when I see it.
1) 7k BTC is really low for an exchange that made half a billion in profits
2) Many users are withdrawing?? Yeah sure you forgot about the tiny little fact that **withdrawals are currently frozen** lol
It would not surprise me either to see a exchange of this size doing shady shit but that doesn't mean that is happening. In fact Occam's razor in a business as profitable as this one leads me to believe exactly the opposite, they just don't need to do anything shady like that shitting gold as they do.
As long as their engineers know how bitcoin works I'm not that concerned about the CEO. Intel CEO probably can't describe the intricacies of the tape-out of their processors, which is fine.

So zero downtime even with two forks that's impressive. Because even when it was forking nodes were online and accepting transactions.
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:44:49
No, you don't have a clue. Mixing nowadays at least by bitmixer doesn't mean combining everyone's coins into a single big transaction or some bullshit, maybe you are thinking of shared send?. Nowadays it's similar to a exchange in fact (that you were suggesting) you send coins and receive fresh new ones with no link to analyze whatsoever to yours from their pool pretty much like receiving from the cold storage of an exchange. With the big difference that there isn't logs like on an exchange instead they use cryptographic letters of warrantee.
So for you to understand it, bitmixer is like an exchange without logs (ip, browser fingerprint etc) or privacy leaks.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:19:30
They still don't know your receiving address because it's just a temporary address that you created in your browser behind a VPN on a temp blockchain.info wallet (for example) and only use to forward the funds to the mixer and immediately discard and never use it again. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:12:54
This sounds super safe. Core is really coherent to support this chain split with no industry or mining support and at the same time oppose a HF with wide support because it's unsafe &lt;rolls eyes&gt;

Why do you think a balance in BTC doesn't require KYC? under many jurisdictions BTC is considered now money but more importantly if you have traded with it (why else would you have it on an exchange?) You have held a fiat balance at one point there subject to KYC. Kraken, bitstamp, GDAX and all the serious exchanges incorporated in countries that aren't tax havens requiere KYC for bitcoin deposits.
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:59:45
You say that as if you weren't parroting shit you've read yourself. Or as if Gavin or any of the contributors to bitcoin with a different opinion didn't exist. I guess that's what bigoted looks like.

Wirex allows you tu have debit cards in euros, usd and GBP, no international fees in Europe if you bring the EUR one to load with BTC as you need.
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:09:29
Nah not really, you are letting your political stance get in the way of reality.
The truth is that currently people are throwing money to shitcoins that are just fucking brochures, Tezos raised more than 200 millions and it's not even vaporware. BCC is being created out of thin air as every crypto token once was, that's irrelevant. What matters is the exposure and its potential, BCC has had a metric ton of exposure, low supply, an air drop, a significant community of people supporting and shilling it many of which do so because they really believe in it and hate Core, support from 3 of the major exchanges... The setup is way more enticing than many ICOs that have raised billions of dollars.
I wish it didn't exist but it does. Don't let your feelings get in the way of your analysis.

Hyperbole??? It was Luke himself who said blocksize should be LOWERED!
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:17:56
Why do people like you and OP struggle so much to understand the business model and type of users that platforms like Binnace has?
Shitcoin traders don't give a flying fuck about the bitcoin maximalist gospel, they don't give a fuck about hodling or private keys, they want to gamble away their funds trading shitcoins and they are not going to withdraw to a wallet to keep their funds frozen there instead of getting their daily fix of trading. And in fact given the very little knowledge they have about how cryptos actually work their funds are more secure inside Binance than a seed written on a piece of paper in her moms basement.
Oh and by the way a platform that makes half a fucking billion in profits a year is not going to need to run a fractional reserve just because they lost 40million...
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:48:05
Binary Investment??? That's some bullshit dogma that's been floating around, for all we know Bitcoin can keep working forever as a niche payment technology in this price range never reaching mass adoption but also not losing its appeal to darknet markets and some geeks or some specific use cases.
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:18:10
Well I hope you spend some even if you buy it back immediately with fiat at an exchange to keep the same amount of BTC, because otherwise without people using it and merchants like WordPress dropping it for lack of users I don't see it growing enough to offset it's inflation to get us out of the downward spiral.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:03:03
It might not, yet as long as nodes and miners are online and processing transactions it can't be called downtime.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:42:02
Actually in my case it went to 190x and back to "just" 40x it has completely changed the life of many of us we just ride the waves with a simile in our face. I don't have to convince anyone to buy bitcoin this shit is here to stay I said that back in 2013 when I joined this sub and I believe in that more than ever. We have an exciting future ahead of us. Buttcoiners can short with leverage and also live the dream if they truly believe it's going to 0 (I suspect their mouths are bigger than their balls though).

Yep someone from AXA should explain to him the benefits of an expensive settlement layer so he gets it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:58:53
Nah the "user" part is misleading. It's more like *"Economically Relevant Nodes Activated Soft Fork"*. Back when it was conceived everything was about how the economic majority will force miners to switch over. Then it became obvious no relevant Exchange, payment processor or economically relevant node was supporting it so the emphasis went back to the user part even though node count is completely useless.
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:15:34
The objective essence of gold independent of the delusional perception people impose on it is TO STORE VALUE what part don't you get about that? When an animal hunts a big prey it must store all the food it wasn't able to eat all at once. When us humans "hunt" or accumulate more wealth than we can "eat" or spend at once we must STORE it somehow. Bitcoin and gold serve an extremely specific purpose for humans in fact its value storing capabilities are more useful to humans that it's wire making capabilities.
Why do you place more value on a gold wire that delivers music to your ears than in a gold bar that stores your wealth so you can spend it layer on? Being able to store your wealth is as practical and useful to humans as the physical properties of gold in manufacturing processes.

As it turns out having a different opinion about some technical approach is not "trolling" Gavin doesn't "troll" and a complicated matter like this one is only that "obvious" to bigots. Transaction Immutability has nothing to do with low level protocol enhancement hardforks like the one bitcoin ALREADY underwent to fix a protocol issue, and even if segwit and all the vaporware becomes a reality we will need an increase at one point anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:33:13
Hi, just so you know a lot of big companies that want segwit have also expressed that they want it activated alongside a blocksize increase so it's not just about miners, the economic majority isn't following either.

@_date: 2016-07-18 23:34:17
They are forced to investigate and freeze accounts because their license requires them to, a money services license for a private company requires them to enforce AML/KYC policies and they can and will be shut down if they ignore them.

Meanwhile on the Ethereum website:
*Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications rthat run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.*
Regardless of bitcoiners that statement is now a big load of bullshit in light of recent events. They should add the phrase *"Except if we don't like the outcome of the code, the we can always fork lol"*
As for bailing out its users, that's another load of bullshit. As a user of Ethereum you won't be bailed out if you fuck up your contract you can't expect the same treatment as this elite that got bailed because they have a lot of devs invested and are apparently "too big to fail" based on arbitrary standards.

The only embarrassing thing is comparing the almost non existent support from the industry bip148 has with this.

Yeah it's easy to troll and throw insults around. Now that you've already done it why don't you  take a little bit of time to reflect on the economic weight of that list and why they don't support the Core scaling roadmap?
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:30:30
Yes, I do think that the amount of the industry that doesn't support the current Core scaling roadmap and want a explicit blocksize increase thrown in there is very large. Segwit2x is a clear example of that and if you add big blockers, BU, Chinese miners etc there's a darker reality than you might get from reading the frontage of this sub and I'm pessimistic.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:58:08
Between all that speculation you forgot about Barry silvert proposal that has an actual real economic majority of industry heavyweights behind it plus a massive amount of hashrate. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 06:32:05
You still have oligarchs in bitcoin. A bunch of miners control most of the hashrate, BTCC even prioritize the transactions of their own customers above yours ignoring the fee and breaking bitcoin neutrality. This people can collude with each other silently and/or be threaten/bribed etc by any of the oligarchs, so at the end of the day you have a few people with a lot of power and the rest of us even in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-10 04:54:14
Opposing a reasonable blocksize increase could be also considered blocking upgrades. 80% of the hashrate supports segwit they just ask for a modest blocksize increase to come along with it.  Your comment is biased.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:40:02
By your backwards logic gold is a wealth destroyer also. It consumes wealth and energy and labour to be extracted to end up as useless bars in the basement of some banks/institutions/governments those bars sitting still for centuries have no other practical purpose than a digital token, in fact they are traded as digital tokens also (IOUs) without even moving and burning wealth to keep them safe and still in their basement for years.
But you see they are not useless because wealth storage is not useless, the resources it requires to exist are not wasted because they serve a very useful purpose for the people even if it's a piece of metal or a digital token with no practical intrinsic utility other than storing value.
Every time someone sends wealth in an easy decentralized manner saving him a lot of money and headaches it gives purpose to the energy miners use to do their "useless" computations in the same way as every time the Google algorithm organizes information for you it gives value to the energy it's servers is burning to do so.

What's the point of this? In case something goes wrong with the mixer they can't refund you.

Hi just so you know, the "industry" were the good guys for the UASF people at the beginning, back when they thought the economic majority will support them. They even created threats cheering companies that pledged support to bip148. Now all of a sudden they are like an evil AI that users have to fight lol just because they support a less reckless way to activate segwit. The list of perceived enemies of the hat wearing people keeps growing and growing.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:54:54
Yeah you are not the first nor will be the last to name calling and throwing insults around which I suspect is the reason why this *irrelevant* companies to name a few don't support the current Core scaling roadmap:

@_date: 2017-06-10 04:57:47
No it's not. They are leaving a lot of money on the table in the form of tx with fees that can't get into blocks and also will lose a massive amount of potential fees once tx move off chain. The g obsolete spam limit Satoshi put in place hurts then economically and they think there's no excuse to keep it like that forever.

What cognitive dissonance? Roger has never said he wants on chain coffees, that's a bullshit oversimplification and that guy is being used for political propaganda. Roger supports segwit2mb, he just wants some on chain scaling and isn't against segwit although he distrusts Core since he thinks that the fact that the company that pays high profile devs thrives on small blocks since it develops sidechains might create a conflict of interest.

Lets try to use a graphic to illustrate how embarrassingly obsolete AM chips are:  This graphic shows the amount of BTC mined by AM over each dividend period, in case you forgot this is the core business of AM, as you can see they went from 6000BTC in July to 300BTC now; that is a massive 90% drop and its a direct result of how obsolete their chips are.
Friedcat himself claimed they will control 10% of the network until December thanks to next gen chips *"...we will have 10% in average of the full network from late April to late December."*  unfortunately they failed to produce any next gen chip in time, so now their obsolete chips are only able to get them to control 1% of the network, a 90% less than their estimations.
Of course the market knows how late they are, by the time their new chip arrives (if it does, that is) a huge amount of 28nm products will be hashing, plus KNC 20nm Neptunes. Which explains why shares dropped almost 90% in value from their ATH

You don't know what you're talking about. Good mixing services break completely the chain giving you fresh coins, using cryptographic letters of warranty because they don't keep logs, how is that traceable?
Using exchanges leaves an IP / account link between your deposit withdrawing addresses that links them together in the eyes of the  exchange operator. The only exception might be shapeshift if you use an anonymous coin and different VPN ips but then again you can't mix enough volume this way.

The SHA256 hashing function is the one thing to crack.
It is a one way function which means we have to try blindlessly different combinations until we get the result that meets the blockchain requirements. Being able to get the input for a desired output (the one that meets the blockchain requirements) he will be able to fork the blockchain since he wouldn't need to perform the trial and error approach that we currently use, he will just use his magical crack to get valid blocks instantly.
Fortunately cracking SHA256 is nonsense

Hi, just so you know miners did agree to that fix both in Hong Kong and now in New York they just want to also increase a little bit an obsolete spam limit like many other industry participants and devs have so far refused to do it arguing It's dangerous while at the same time covertly supporting a contentious chain split with no industry backing which is way more dangerous.

This depends how you interpret it. Of course it's concerning that they don't know exactly the scope of the hack, on the other hand the fact that they are not willing to rush it to protect their reputation and their business and instead are being cautions and taking their time to investigate everything before opening withdrawals speaks volumes to me.


This is not shady at all since legacy auditing and insurance firm just outright refuse to work with crypto companies they don't even have suitable procedures yet. The Winklevii brothers which run the most serious crypto businesses did an interview where they explain this in detail and how it's currently almost near imposible to get audited or insured as a crypto company.

Christ you really don't have a fucking clue. 
Exchanges have peer to peer lending markets where people get paid interest (a ton during bear markets) to lend their coins to shorters. People doing so know perfectly well their coins are being lent to shorters and they do so for the interest. Some exchanges like kraken have their own liquidity pools to lend coins that eventually dries up which means they are not using customers funds.
So no you dumbass exchanges don't steal customers bitcoins to lend, their customers do so freely go check the interest rates for lending bitcoins on bitfinex for example.

Precisely if you were the target of such an attack you should avoid behaving the same way. I see now that you have deleted your original comment so you know it's true. You shouldn't insult everyone that disagrees with you on how to activate segwit, even people that share the same distrust to Jihan or Ver calling them rbtc shills just because they don't think bip148 is a good way to activate it.

@_date: 2017-06-10 05:56:45
This doesn't make any sense, like, at all.
Miners need desperately a blocksize increase because the demand for bitcoin TX is there but not the capacity to process them. They need a network with enough onchain capacity to process as much fees as possible even if they are cheaper. A crippled network where only rich people can afford the fees but won't make many transactions since they use it as a store of value and almost all use cases are priced out and moved to other chains is extremely more unprofitable for miners than a thriving network with 2x or 4x the capacity to collect fees on chain and a lot of demand and use cases. It's completely obvious, it's the reason why 80% of the hashrate supports segwit2mb.
There's just no excuse to block a modest increase to 2mb in 2017.

It's important to understand that segwit is crucial to a decentralized bitcoin. BIP148 is just one way to activate the technology it has no significant support from the economic majority currently or miners. At the beginning they used to rally behind big companies and payment processors since they are the economic majority to support it since they chose a different proposal to activate the technology now they pull a 180° and suddenly those companies are evil, want bitcoin destroyed blah blah.

Your post, your oversimplifications and the ultimatum-type of way you speak is the very definition of the divide in bitcoin.


If this oversimplistic approach of miners as comic book villains hijacking the network was true then the industry will signal for segwit right away and won't request a blocksize increase. They are not doing that. Jihan might be the boogie man, but the issue with blocksize is WAY more complex than that.


I agree. Since Segwit does not have support by itself from the economic majority unfortunately it can no longer be activated as the safe scaling measure you speak of but rather as a contentious UASF which is *at least* as dangerous as a contentious HF an more dangerous than a Segwit2x HF with 80% of the hashrate and support from industry heavyweights.


That table you speak of was laid by satoshi and he clearly said that the spam limit (that's what the blocksize actually is) could be phased out later. I'm not saying that the word of satoshi or his intentions should be set in stone but your statement about what was on the table is wrong.


Yes there was, and a lot of reputable companies that have worked tirelessly to bring bitcoin to where it is now signed that agreement and you calling them a scammers so nonchalantly illustrates my point about the divide in bitcoin.

Bear in mind that the cost to mine is not equal to everyone. The difficulty increase means that in the long run it may not be profitable to mine for amateurs who have to buy hardware from third party manufacturers and who have high electricity costs. But more professional approaches to mining that develop their own hardware and can deploy it in very efficient datacenters ala Asicminer will be the future of bitcoin mining.

Umm no. The wallet service from OP wasn't compromised/attacked. Bitcoins aren't stored in wallets, they are stored in the public blockchain protected only by your private key. A wallet service only stores your private key. So you can try to brute force any bitcoin address regardless of the wallet service the user has, to try to get the private key, this will be useless for random bitcoin addresses but will succeed with private keys based on guessable passphrases. Which is what happened to OP his bitcoin address was cracked not his wallet service.

Of course I don't believe Asicboost is fake and of course I expect Segwit2mb to block it.
That being said, all miners fight to have an edge an I fail to see why Asicboost is more morally reprehensible than for example going lower on the nanometer scale of your chips which also gives you an edge over other miners which you deserve in my opinion if you can pull it off, but since it's the cornerstone excuse some people use to block a blocksize increase I'm happy to see it go of it means one less excuse to block segwit2x.

Actually you can protect yourself from keyloggers by using as a password a hash of your password instead of the password itself.
For example, if your pasword is "mcockiner1234" you have to go to an online hash generator website such as this one:  enter your password and use the hash (or just part of it, lets say 20 characters) as the actual password of the website, you don't have to remember those 20 characters, each time you need to login to that website you go to an online hash generator you use your password to generate the hash which is the REAL password and you copy/paste that into the password box.
So, if you had a keylogger it will record mcockiner1234 when you enter it on the hash generator but that is not your real password, and the keylogger has no way to know that you are using a hash or what hash function did you choose on the website or how many characters from that hash are you  using as a password or the hash itself since you're not typing it but copy/paste it from the hash generator into the password box.
EDIT: Of course this isn't a foolproof method by any means!! and yes, a keylogger can also monitor your clipboard or take screen-captures, record your browsing history etc etc. This is just an extra layer of security to make things a little bit more complicated to someone trying to steal your password, and hopefully defeat malware that records keystrokes in bulk or devices such as this:  But if someone has infected your machine and is proactively trying to steal your password he may figure out this quickly. So, again, this is ONLY a good practice that doesn't hurt and provides SOME additional security.

Bitcoins are not stored on your wallet file on your computer, your wallet files only stores a key that allows you to claim ownership of those bitcoins.

So taping out around the end of January and 90 days for wafer production + chip packaging and blade assembly means we're still about half a year away from gen3 deployment right?

Mining IS profitable in some cases if you did your homework. My KNC Jupiter day 1 will have made 22BTC back from the 50 I paid before the next adjustment, it'll be worth running until we reach 15PH and before that happens I expect it to make the remaining 28BTC back. The current difficulty is something expected KNC alone were bringing 1.5PH online anyone that did their homework knew that, also hashfast batch 1 will bring 220TH asicminer 500TH and bitfury another 500TH by the end of this month... Difficulty will start leveling off around 8PH...

The rumors about third payment processors not being allowed to work with exchanges are true unfortunately. The implications of this is debatable, some people say that Chinese people can still send money through regular (non anonymous) bank wires to exchanges, but we don't know if this method will also be banned in the future.
China has strict capital controls and btc is the perfect tool to defy them, so this attack by Chinese regulators has some logic I'm afraid.

He was referring to how uninformed he is about bitcoin and Rogers intentions not about his accent.
Roger like many other people in the bitcoin community think that the spam limit satoshi put in place is obsolete and that the network can grow on chain, not to buy coffee, which is bullshit an a oversimplification to discredit everyone that wants a modest on chain capacity increase. Roger supports segwit which is what will be used for coffees, he signed the New York agreement he just wants to also grow on chain even if it's just 2mb because he thinks there's no excuse not to in 2017. He also considers bitcoin as a store of value, a store of value that can afford 2mb blocks as we get close to 2020.
Oh and by the way, sobre la situación en Venezuela podría explicarte muchas cosas y no me gusta nada que se nos use de forma sesgada en una batalla política sobre la escalabilidad de bitcoin, tener bloques de 2mb no afecta en absoluto negativamente a la usabilidad de bitcoin aquí.

Yes. I get your point, but I didn't say that bitcoin isn't increasing here at a very very significant pace.
Bitcoin may have seen a very fast, very significant even exponential increase from nanoscopic to microscopic scale here in a few months, yes. But unfortunately it's still microscopic/invisible here, again, it has never been featured in any major news outlet. When I say that no one in my family/friends circles have heard about it I wasn't trying to imply that that has any statistical relevance I was saying that to illustrate that headlines that imply that my whole country is turning to bitcoin are an overstatement, because regardless of the very significant increase in users (which it's awesome) it's still a very niche/invisible thing here for the general public.
BTW I live in a big city (currently Madrid, before several years in Barcelona) all my friends/coworkers have higher education many of them work at banks and one of them at Standard and Poor's the kind of environment where something as interesting and with game-changing potential as bitcoin should permeate quickly. The fact that no one has heard about bitcoin IMHO illustrates my point about the overstatements in this kind of headlines.
Other than that I agree, this is the age of pioneers, and we **do** have influence :).

- They are hashing at almost 200th on their private pool: 
- The 200TH project based on bitfury is currently hashing at 50TH and accelerating towards their 200TH goal: 
- Megabigpower team of bitfury machines on btcguild currently top 1 with 45.5TH 
So the highly efficient bitfury chips have had a huge impact in a very short time, they are responsible for at least 30% of the network right now.
Also I highly doubt that all the chips from AVALONs chip sale debacle are in some dumpster. Most of them are probably hashing right now somewhere.

Of course they are not going to let the cooling center empty until spring, the problem is that no matter how cool you keep those now completely obsolete chips they won't be able to gain any significant % of the network, specially once the new 28nm watercooled behemoths from some manufacturers start hitting the network by early 2014

Yes, to spend anything you need the private keys. For each address you have a single private key, you can do as many transactions as you want for each address, and yes you can only use one address so you will only have one private key to worry about. The number of public addresses your wallet has is something you decide.
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:27:56
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:56:59
You should also create a new address/addresses in your wallet and send your coins from your old addresses to the new ones so that the encrypted wallet the attacker may have is now useless because the addresses it has stored are now empty.

It's funny you guys with the paranoia about agendas and what not. As it turns out I want to see segwit activated as much as you do that's why I think a deluded proposal with no support is more dangerous to that goal than BU. I wholeheartedly agree about the situation with transaction fees but you are wrong when you portray bip148 as the only solution to activate segwit, bip148 is just the less popular and there is no ambivalence either, a lot of industry heavyweights and massive amount of hashrate support explicitly a different alternative. So my question is, again, why would anyone prefer to try to activate segwit jumping off a cliff with a proposal with no support instead of one with 80% hashrate and a lot of industry support including payment processor like bitpay. It's a honest question.
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:56:03
Still, why would people bother to search for a pool that merge mines that profitless blockchain instead of merge mine Namecoin or some other cryto?
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:42:55
As your example shows, fees are roughly 100 times less profitable than block reward so it still doesn't answer the question of who will bother mining unless the exchange rate is very high in which case fees will be really expensive defeating the purpose of bitcoin. So no real answer IMO for this one.

Well not exactly, money supply is regulated/created by central banks i.e. governments, not by specialized companies competing with each other on a free unregulated market. So it'll make more sense to compare it to actual gold mining, at first during the gold rush era amateurs were mining gold using shovels, in the end only big mining companies remained. But yes, unfortunately this will inevitably bring more centralization to bitcoin.

You're comparing the supply of oil with the transaction limit which is not a good comparison IMO you should compare the supply of oil with the supply of bitcoin, the less there is from both the more valuable the become. But, unlike bitcoin, oil does not have a transaction limit, your can buy it or sell it at will with billions of transaction per second all around the world.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a very cheap an efficient way of transferring value over the internet, the moment we hit the transaction limit bitcoin will have to adopt measures that will make it lose this properties (to some extent) which are what makes bitcoin useful in the first place.

Yes the blockchain (do not confuse with the website blockchain.info) is the database/ledger that keeps track of who owns every bitcoin in existence, it's secured by miners who add to it new entries (bitcoin transactions) and secure them mathematically with their massive amount of computing power.
So let me try to explain. You know that your bank account balance in a bank is just a number on a database on the computers of the bank, there isn't a pile of physical money on some safe of the bank with your balance in it. On bitcoin likewise your balance is stored in a database, but, unlike a bank this database is public and shared by everyone on the network. When you "send" bitcoins the only thing you're doing is making a new entry on this database/ledger saying -I Bob am sending 1BTC to Alice- in order to be able to do that you need a key that identifies you as the owner of those bitcoins, THAT key is what's stored on your wallet file.

One thing is a wallet and another is a Bitcoin address.
A wallet can have several Bitcoin addresses.
So, you know what is the address you used to received bitcoins but you lost the wallet that holds the private key of that address, is that it?

Take a picture/screen capture of the QR code that is shown by the website when setting up two factor authentication with the Google authenticator app.
If you lose your phone, just scan the QR code again with your new phone and you will have working codes to login.
EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT. Beware that the old/stolen phone still has working codes on the google authenticator app so the one who stole your phone has your codes (although maybe not your password). So the best thing to do once you've regained access to your account using the backup QR code is to disable and reenable two factor authentication so that the old codes on your stolen phone are no longer working.

By the beginning of November the network will reach between 3 to 4 PH. That's only counting real chips:	
-knc had sold several thousand machines (interview in Swedish website) which means between 1 and 2PH
-friedcat announced 500TH for October
-Dave sold around 200TH of bitfury based miners in the US for October delivery plus October delivery of EU bitfury miners plus the remaining 150TH for the 200TH project (currently at 50TH)

So far this admittedly cool setup hasn't have any significant impact in the % of the network AM controls, so let's hope it'll bring some real advantage when/if their new chips become a reality, by spring do expect competitors (knc) to have 20 -16 nm 4gen chips, so let's hope AM is developing at least 3rd gen 28nm chips, otherwise...

Bitcoin is a very easily tradeable commodity, I don't see any problem with people holding and wanting Bitcoin to appreciate, this is totally compatible to wanting to have services a things to spend it to directly without having to cash out to fiat. It's like storing your capital in gold (which can't be artificially depreciated like fiat) and being able to spend it directly when you see fit our you need to.

Wut? With ASICminer adding 200TH (as they have announced) to the network during summer, AVALON Batch 2 and 3 shipping, close to 1 million AVALON chips sold (samples already shipped), BITfury having successfully taped out their chip and preselling 120Ghashes miners and BFL shipping something...
(not to mention the 100TH project based on bitfury chips or KnC)
Care to explain your logic when your say difficulty may go down???

10 million?
Titan, the fastest computer in world which costs $160 million is capable of doing 17petaflops, the Bitcoin network is outputting 600+ petaflops.
I know they are not really comparable and that they can invest that money in hashing-specific hardware but still I think it's an enormous task to catch up with the Bitcoin network...
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:22:45
You do know that currently there isn't any profitable way to get in the game right? The competition is fierce and if you spend money now on mining equipment it probably won't be profitable by the time you receive it.

Just tell a half truth, that means you don't have to remember bullshit, so no one could catch you.
For example, tell them you've started trading bitcoins tell them about how exciting this thing is and that it's making you some more than your job so you're quitting, just don't tell anyone that you're rich, simply treat it as new career path in your life.

Can you please elaborate on your security practices.

Each month difficulty doubles so did you make your ROI calculations taking into account that? Or did you calculate the 3 month ROI assuming stable difficulty during those 3 months?

This is so spot on!
@_date: 2013-08-25 09:11:18
No one doubts the technical capabilities of Cointerra, but, someone with your background should see that their price point given their delivery date makes no sense. Keep in mind that they say that they will credit you some hashing power «in your NEXT order» if they are more than 30 days late. So they are going to probably deliver by the end of January at least that's the margin they give themselves. So, again, someone that follows bitcoin closely knows that with the amount of players entering the network this fall that price point could make anyone who trusts them lose money.
@_date: 2013-09-23 08:42:35
If knc succeeds this is completely wrong. They are bringing several thousand machines (or so they claim) to the network before the 15th of October. That's between 1 and 2.5 PH of hashing power more than twice the current network total, also bitfury October deliveries... Your difficulty adjustments are way too low.
@_date: 2013-08-29 08:39:31
You can't crush everyone without crushing yourself in the process. The moment you dominate or centralize the mining power, the moment bitcoin loses its security model and its value. So any big player needs to be really careful about the amount of the network they want to control to keep at least the apparent impression of decentralization for bitcoin to still be worth anything.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:15:33


And that my friend is the magic of bitcoin, what makes it valuable, the counter-intuitive fact that absolutely no one runs it, that it's a self sustainable network/protocol that unlike wikipedia doesn't require central servers, staff etc.
I'll try to explain.
Bitcoin is a peer to peer internet protocol, there are no central servers or bitcoin infrastructure. Everything runs on the computers of its users, when you install the official bitcoin software your computer becomes a node and it connects to other nodes (the ones closer to you) which in turn are connected to other nodes which are connected to other nodes etc etc thus creating a sort of neuronal network: millions of computers connected to each other through a mesh of interconnections without a central server or a single point of failure. Still with me? this type of network doesn't require any labor or infrastructure it's just computers connected to each other over the internet running a software that it's open source, so once the network is up and running not even the creator of the protocol can change the software already installed on the computers of bitcoin users.
Mining: However the bitcoin network requires processing power to secure itself, the people that contribute that processing power are NOT volunteers, they are doing it for a reward, they are being paid in bitcoins by the bitcoin algorithm. 
You see, the creator of the protocol solved two problems with one shot, he figured out how to allocate processing power for the network and how to introduce new bitcoins into the system without a central bank and in a automated and controlled way. The idea is that new bitcoins are given to people that contribute to secure the network with their own computers: miners. The more processing power I contribute the more bitcoins I get. Also anyone can mine bitcoins, miners are distributed all over the world also so again there isn't a single point of failure here.
So there you have it. The guy based the system on two principles that never fail: Math and Greed (or economic incentive to miners if you prefer).
This network is based on a mathematical framework, its completely neutral, universal and it's free of politics or human error/decisions.
@_date: 2013-08-20 19:44:28
Yes, they are encrypted on your wallet which is irrelevant since they aren't stealing them from your wallet, they are "guessing" I.e. reverse engineering them from your vulnerable transactions which are publicly available.

This are my calculations and the reason why I sold my two day 1 jupiters.
(I'm from spain so decimals are separated by , instead of . and dates are this format: day/month/year)
The column on the far left is % increases per difficulty period (time to mine 2016 blocks) that I pulled out of my ass (a high increase to 3PH and then it slows down) but which I think are consistent with the global Hashrate announced and that KNC will be bringing to the network. Mining days are adjusted based on the next % increase.
The breakeven line is the cumulative costs+original investment.
I'm assuming 500GH/s, 1.6BTC monthly costs (electricity etc) 66BTC original investment including VAT+shipping+psu and that I start mining on 10/03/2013 hence 2,85 mining days at current difficulty. 100% uptime and no pool fees.
Edit: updated the chart with new 550 Jupiter hashrate

Yes, you may have to trust the website/service with your password but if you ALSO have to trust LastPass you added a second weak link to your security model, again, it's your choice but don't say a security model with two weak links is the same as one with only one weak link, because it's NOT.
So apparently my security model doesn't make sense because why would they bother accessing my 30+ passwords from lastpass immediately with a quick simple stroke instead of sending court orders to 30+ companies/websites scattered all over the fucking world? ...yeah that second option makes all the sense in the world.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:31:00
Yes this is true but I actually showed them a trick so they don't need to remember a long password. I've installed a hasing extension on their chrome browsers so they type there their passphrase/password and use its hash as the actual password, this also gives some (very basic) level of protection against keyloggers since they only type their passphrase and then they copy/paste the hash which is the actual password (not the passphrase).
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:00:39

Avalon has had pretty bad hiccups before, but they responded and explained themselves somehow.
Now they have disappeared from the face of the earth amid strong rumors of the team falling apart. Gridchip their chip designer is looking for new partners/capital for their next gen 40nm chips, and has hinted to big delays in TSMC...

Most if not all of the cold storage addresses of big exchanges are public and fully loaded with bitcoins as anyone can see in the blockchain so I don't expect anything significant happening aside an annoying increase in fees. Also I don't know why would traders bother with this.

They haven't showed anything ASIC (just and fpga prototype) we are approaching September (when they are supposed to ship their first units) and still no hard evidence. That being said they look more trustworthy than other alternatives.
Also, please really make some due diligence on mining revenue, they have announced they will cut the price in half for November deliveries, there is an incoming shockwave of ASIC hashpower, maybe October isn't enough at their current price to ROI with thousands of Bitfury, AVALON and BFL chips/going online plus the new generation chips announced for this fall (Alydian, hashfast, labcoin, btcgarden, cointerra etc)

I'm having a heart attack! 
I haven't lose anything yet but some of my friends bought  because I was really enthusiastic about bitcoin and now I kind of feel bad (although all my points about bitcoin where about how revolutionary a system it is, not about getting rich fast).
Don't get me wrong this is part of the game and I'm here for the long run, but trading isn't for the faint of heart and no matter how much I love bitcoin in the future I should be more careful when selling it to other people, who might see it as magical way to get rich fast instead of the awesome system it is.
Now I need to relax and disable my ticker extension from chrome and remove the widget from my phone, and on the future I might focus my investments in mining hardware, less risk and also I contribute to securing the network.

You can silently cash out BTC for cash using localbitcoins. I don't know about your country but here 500 coins are easy to trade for cash in person in a major city. Also your can purchase gold and sell it or even purchase goods with your BTC and resell them for cash in a Craigslist type of site...

It's very simple really, there is no profitable way to get into mining right now. CPU and GPU are obviously dead and 1st generation ASICs are dying right now at current difficulty. 
The only way to get into mining is to buy a gen2 ASIC miner, but since there is no ready to ship option you'll have to wait a preorder queue and unless you're at the top of that preorder queue (you preordered several months ago) you'll end up spending more money than coins you'll get back.
To make it more simple here is a example (made up figures), if you spend say $3000 on a miner now you'll get it in December (if you're lucky) and it'll make maybe a total of 15BTC in its life cycle before it can't even pay for the electricity it uses, so it's better to go buy BTC directly with those $3000 and get 20BTC upfront instead of a miner that will only give you 15BTC.
