As long as it looks bullish, step in.
However, always don’t invest more than what you are willing to lose. That’s the most important thing.

What is the issue here ? Can you explain ? Someone from reddit might help.

I would call it a simulation of what most people hear when they listen to a valid video explaining what Bitcoin is....but it’s hilarious I can’t stop laughing

You did more than just the right thing. Anyone who is hodling here for not buying something at the end would be lying, however what makes your case special is that you did that for someone that you love, showing gratitude and not expecting any return, and that deserves applauds, people with big hearts, generous and helping others are the winners in this life.

I was not in the mood, but you made me laugh in tears. Thank you.

What really defines an idiot is what he does, before finding out the consequences of what he did, I might be myself an idiot if I judge the guy, but I won’t judge him because nobody knows the true story, which I believe would be much more different from a news paper headline hooking up as many people as possible.
Having said that, If the story is real, and the guy just took the bet without any sense of family responsibility, then I agree with all those who called him an idiot, and there’s a lot of them out there who have been gambling their lives since the beginning of time...before Satoshi’s discovery.

Send the floppy disk via Dhl and put the tracking number in one of the blocks of any blockchain and explain that to the recruiter and you might get a chance.
