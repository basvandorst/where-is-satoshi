I bought a used car from a friend when BTC was $2k. Everyone came out ahead since we paid less than the car was worth at the time. Re-bought the btc immediately. No regrets. They fully understand the risk of a price crash.

A few months ago my wife and I bought a used van from a friend for 1 BTC loaded on a Trezor. This was our friend’s first experience with Bitcoin. We’re happy that we get to brag about buying a van for BTC, and our friend is happy that she got paid so much for a van.

For anybody wondering, it's legit, and I paid her $45 USD worth of Bitcoin after explaining the risks. She still thought it was awesome. Also, she's 55 and not into computers. She just heard about bitcoin somehow, heard from a friend that I'm in to Bitcoin, and asked for Bitcoin as payment. Blew my mind.

And I found out that she heard about it from her cousin, an employee at So. Cal Edison. He heard about it in a benefits seminar where employees were informed about Bitcoin being a benefits option, I'm guessing through Fidelity.
Her kids also want to get in on it now that she's in to it.

I bought them on the dark web for 11k BTC. Most expensive bad decision ever. And they start depreciating as soon as you unbox them behind Walgreens.

Even the people who didn’t stand up were absorbed.
