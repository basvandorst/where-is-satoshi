I have a very different moon date than most people here.  I don't see bitcoin gaining mainstream acceptance in the next year or two, but I believe it will eventually pull through.  Additionally, it's not ready for "the moon" yet as there are quite a few scalability issues that need to be addressed first.  However, saying 2014 had no significant development, is just flat out wrong.  Tons of new companies have popped up, tons of companies started accepting it, and a lot of VC is going into the arena.  2014 was basically the first year people even heard of bitcoin, the first year investors even considered it.  For all intents and purposes, I consider this the first year of bitcoin's existence, because it's the year when the spotlight was shined on it.  The prior years really was just a niche payment protocol for a select few enthusiasts.  Now it's blossomed into something many people have heard of.  Mainstream adaption takes time, and when it occurs, I will be ready!

It was too obvious, was testing the limits.  Now I know what they are.  It's funny you should mention the puppy post, that was actually me who wrote that one :-p

I know my post will incite trolls, but that's OK.  I've read the white paper, I've read mastering bitcoin, I know its strengths, its weaknesses, and its flaws.  I'm fully confident in the future of this technology to the point where I will bet my savings on it.  Most of you trolls just flat out don't have a clue about bitcoin or blockchain tech.
