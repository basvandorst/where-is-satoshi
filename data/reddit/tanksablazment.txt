The thing you have to consider is: Do you want *the functionality* to stay the same? As in how it was for years and how it was designed? Without full blocks and with low fees and trustless and decentralized?

We've seen evidence of 'comment-bots' with pro Core talking points too..
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:07:19
...there is no question censorship is a large and ongoing part of this subreddit. Considering all the hard evidence proving it, only those with an agenda or who really have done zero research repeat the easily disprovable lie that there is no censorship here.
Also having a comment not delteted once does not mean there is no longer any censorship anywhere. 
lol the mods there deleted my comment without telling me!
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:34:22
the 3 people you thanked are those that spend a lot of time *posting* misinformation and being unhelpful, just have a look at the links you made.

Luckily we have a specification forBitcoin given to us by the designer of the system
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:39:27
Do you mean 23&gt; 
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:37:43
There is evidence that most users there are early btc adopters and very long time users, and that the commenters on r/bitcoin are mostly by people looking ot make money and who don't have any strong understanding of the system
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:03:24
I like the ideas in MW but the ideas are far removed from the Bitcoin conceptual specification given to us by Satoshi. 
Perhaps this is the facebook to my bitcoinspace
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:34:48
do a search for 'bots' or comment bots. They were topics posted to this subreddit around the start of the opinioncleansing 
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:10:37
I have to say I think you've got things totally backwards. The people I see commenting proSW don't seem to have any understanding of how btc works nor the history, while those opposing SW all tend to be early adopters and long time users.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:22:22
Then you won't see anything from here on your front page, that's the whole idea behind subscriptions. When you log in you only see your own personal homepage of your own subreddits at reddit.com
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:36:03
I advise you to do the same for nullc lukejr and adam3, they spend a lot of time going out of their way to be unhelpful and to prolong controversy, there are many times where you can see this behaviour
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:07:34
And also look at those who are unhelpful, who post vague or misleading comments and don't add citations. These people should not be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:05:25
Yes, there are *so many* lies being used to try and sell segregated witness. it really, really, really turns people off to it. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:04:58
I'm afraid I don't see your reasoning here. As Bitcoin was designed, full nodes should be in large data centers, not run in homes. I'd link you to the whitepaperbut I would get my comment silenceod
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:27:06
biased opinion with  no basis in reality based on unfounded previous biased opinions. 
Highly scientific analysis you got there Lou
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:26:19
I dare say that is the whole point. So it doesn't end up like a legal bill with lots of riders, address one issue with one things.
Computer science 101: keep it simple, stupid. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:15:04
People are learning that there is nothing to fear about a hard fork unless you're a frady-cat.
We've known for years there are no technical objections to forks whichhave always been a part of Bitocin. Some people are just too scard to move forward. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:28:24
I've previously labeled you as divisive and I see that is totally true
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:24:19
I would say you've got it backwards
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:45:02
Yes, just pick which client you want to run and turn it on. Properly advertised they would sell well if they worked well
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:39:46


Either this is the joke or the root of the problem.
The whitepaper is what explains the concept of Bitcoin, it's the reference. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:51:46
Please read the bitcoin whitepaper for yourself, you will see there are some people pushing for an altcoin called Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:59:54
Hi, I am wondering if my previous comment to you showed up
@_date: 2016-11-10 00:30:30
I wouoldn't be so sure, I've seen a few comments from some of the more 'vocal' core contributers implying they would want demurage in the future or to get rid of tx types such as P which would erase anyone's coins that was unable to move them in time. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:43:45
IIRC he is legally not allowed to help anyone obtain the license for profit
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:01:51


1) they aren't staff, they don't get paid
2) what do you base this on? I messaged the admins on my own volition and posted that in a thread, the admins responded to me. I don't see any evidence to back up your statements
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:45:16
I think many people have different visions of what Bitcoin should be and they do conflict, that coupled with """"moderation"""" here like there is in China's newspaper leads to most people being misinformed or confused
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:42:06
maybe some of those hundred of thousands of dollars worth of development he has been paying can show themselves worth some part of it
@_date: 2016-11-17 00:14:23
Do yourlsef and everyone else a favor and learn about what bitcoin was intended to be:
I believe you will quickly find the motives for those things you mentioned are all in line with the designe of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:04:26
hahahaha, you don't get very basic things that you harp on and on about, you say you're a lawyer!?! Hahahaha
@_date: 2017-01-09 16:05:35
it's not encryption it's hashing. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:42:45
When you silence a bunch of people for BS reasons, they often get upset about it. The divide is a result of this place
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:24:50
I have a shelf full of these type of newspaper stories that mention bitcoin. Why, no idea, but I have them.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:58:22
Core is a loose collection of 10-20 frequently contributing people, over 100 people have contributed recently but most of them only once (it's been said that some of the current devs are rude and hostile to new comers)
Core is probably the wrong organization to blame, but the people who are contributing most to the problem do seem to be closely algined with 'core'.
I wouldn't say 'core' is to blame, but that doesn't mean some people who contribute to 'core' are not to blame. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 21:02:28
I think the killing citizens is newish but Bush started war without ratification
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:44:17
and many many many more people have had their comments deleted, or sneakily removed here
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:55:07
I have, can you provide an example of why this would be possible with a 2MB maxed out block but not a 1MB full block?
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:41:29
Why are you so unhelpful? You can still be constructive but without being a dick.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:53:38
I disagree, himself has voiced favor or getting rid of old tx types, which could removed coins in cold storage
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:30:14
Best guess is what happened with USA's 10,000$ bill et al
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:39:42
get out now, someone has turned the once fun community in on itself like the US's politics. The fun is gone, and science too sadly
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:54:11
One could just as easily say the opposite
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:03:22
You've posted a number of posts where you show massive lack of understanding of simple things like reddit.com
if you can't learn how reddit works on a basic level, you surely don't know a thing about bitcoin, and as such your opinion is frivolous 
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:05:30
Full blocks are a technical disaster, they ensure high fees and unhappy users, they greatly encourage people to move to other chains and to abandon Bitcoin.
*If* *any* other chain arrises that is not capped it will swiftly overtake bitcoin use by way that it works better (in the way Bitcoin was designed, to have a high volume of low fee txs)
I see no one, not even thoughtmastermaxwell is able to put into words any logic to support full blocks in the real world application of them.
