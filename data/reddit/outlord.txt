Can someone please explain to me 
The negative needles on the bottom screen when aggressive buying and selling is happening? I will add a screenshot somehow if I haven't explained well enough. They seem to be sells going in under the asking price. But if that's the case, why arent they being sold?

Will we look back and laugh at this at the end of 2019 or will John McAfee be eating his Johnson?

then you better sell. you could be right you could be wrong. just like the pope

Send me some of your bitcoin, i will sell it and you can guarantee the price will rise by 5%  lol

If only it were that simple.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:17:08
Maybe You could :P

Beam me up Scotty, There are no intelligent life forms down here.

This seems a bit too harsh for profit taking. Is China clamping down again already? It's only been 2 days.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:50:00
This is great! All those coins made cheap for the masses!

Bitcoin is 'first sign of greed since Great Recession,' says Federated's Chiavarone - Is it?

personally I found coinbase to be a rip-off. Find a local Exchange, buy some btc, register to an exchange like hitbtc and move your coin there. Safest Wallet I can think of. If you register through that link I get a spiv of some sort. 
you can trade with no fees if u are smart. even get a rebate. I have registered to 10 different exchanges now and this is my preferred of all.

My understanding is the fees are demand related. Which is fair. Remember people invest alot of dough into miners and electricity etc so that your transactions are fast as possible and safe. BTC in its current form is a great standard for all other coins to build apon. Therefor Digital Gold 2.0 is a very apt name for it.

Is it plausible, optimistic I already know but here goes...
Trump, baffoon that he is has a head for business or so they say. Might put the thumbdrive with silk road booty into knox and quietly accumilate bear share or 51% hopefully. then declaere that bitcoin is the bees knees?
Crazy? lor plausible

Another bank say "BOO!"
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:30:56
He makes a good point. The tax break means big business will want to invest "spare dough" hmm I know a risky asset that's just ripe for the picking.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:20:28
Ok, So how much BTC has the Feds sold so far? None, Some or All? The smart money might see China dumping as an oportunity. Get bigger slice of pie at low price then move in for the kill. Condone bitcoin and the price skyrockets. We win US governemnt wins. China loses. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:55:37
Am I right in guessing this is BCH offloading the remainder of their BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:18:22
You may as well be waiting for the 5k Buy In in that case. Have you heard about that one?
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:19:21
It's real money
