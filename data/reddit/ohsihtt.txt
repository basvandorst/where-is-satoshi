Again, if Average Joe wouldn't do it, the solution is for all intents and purposes out of scope and hence worthless.

CoinJoin offers cost *savings* compared to normal transactions. The more transactions you pool together, the more money moves and you only pay one miner's fee.
With this in mind, Bitcoin's "official" transactions per second numbers are **very misleading**. One broadcasted transaction can represent the transactional demand had by MILLIONS of individuals. You just pool all the transactions together as this maximizes privacy. But here if the block size limit isn't raised, people would be pooling transactions together out of necessity.
Since this makes CoinJoin expressly necessary, it also legalizes the use case which ensures Bitcoin's fungibility. Also, this requires no soft fork. The software is available TODAY, and people really want to use it. This is an extremely simple method of scaling Bitcoin ON CHAIN that doesn't stress full nodes and is completely devoid of hocus pocus.

If there is any perceived cost to running a full node compared to running an SPV wallet, individuals won't want to run full nodes. Part of that cost is a lack of wallet seed, but it's not even close to a main driver of cost.
Full nodes should be as easy to run on an "old" Windows PC as an antivirus program. Average Joe should be able to sync the full blockchain in minutes, without stressing his CPU, bandwidth or disk space. It's insanity to be talking about Moore's Law allowing us to *survive* bigger blocks when Bitcoin full nodes are already too taxing to run on consumer hardware. Simplicity and robustness over mainstream acceptance.

Wait for Moore's Law to take hold BEFORE increasing block size, instead of risking it all on Moore's Law taking hold and screwing over full nodes even more.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:56:26
Fees can be crowdfunded by individuals trustlessly and only one transaction would need to be broadcast to meet the needs of potentially *millions* of people simultaneously. This with no middleman, no forking changes, and upholding privacy and fungibility.

The block size limit combined with Bitcoin transaction fees works like a highway toll, where if the toll increases the usage of the highway decreases. Most developers would agree the blockchain is an extremely inefficient data structure. Here's an idea: maybe it *should* be extremely expensive to put transactional data on the main Bitcoin blockchain. THAT is the simplest solution of ALL.
If it's the case that a block can hold 20MB of transactions, then maybe we will *see* 20MB of on-chain transactions. The question is, is that optimal from a supply and demand perspective? If it's $100 to cross the bridge to SF instead of $10, less people would cross it by car. People would only cross if they really needed to, which is how it should be with the Bitcoin blockchain.
If you had a startup, wouldn't you rather deploy a blockchain explorer on your local Windows PC as easily as you run Firefox or an FTP client? If we freeze the block size limit ad wait ten years, maybe you could. If not, maybe you couldn't, and that would be bad.
That's how easy it should be to run a full node before we start talking about upping the resource requirements for running a full node even further.

The BTC block reward will drop to 3.125 [by 2025]( 99% of all Bitcoins will be in circulation by 2032. What is your plan to increase transaction fees if not for advocating wider adoption of these innovative on-chain use cases?
Presumably Bitcoin full node operators have a financial stake in the success of the Bitcoin ecosystem, and I fail to see how game tokens taking off wouldn't increase transaction fees which does nothing but *increase* the network's long term viability.

Exactly at issue is that Bitcoin Core is painful to run. Why should it be? Bitcoin Core has no reason to be painful - the problem is the requirements to run a Bitcoin full node are *already* too taxing on most personal computers. It takes too long. It takes too much CPU. Running a Bitcoin full node should be no harder or slower than using a GUI FTP client. And we should have multiple widely adopted implementations of a Bitcoin full node before we start calling wallets decentralized.

Hedgy must escrow BTC on the blockchain somehow, in a way where the code interfacing with the blockchain *provably* determines its proper owner on the forward contract's settlement date, accomplished in a trustless manner.
Clearly, most current Bitcoin wallets don't have this feature, not even in development, as this feature isn't built into the Bitcoin protocol and requires an enormous amount of effort to develop and maintain.
Hedgy very well could have worked out some kind of a deal with Blockstream to pilot their technology on private sidechain code. More likely than not, and this is still a good thing, Hedgy will come out with more great marketing, and follow it up with developing internally a bitcoin application for signing BTC tied up in multisig for forward contract resolution over to the rightful owner on settlement date. They'll then use marketing to explain how there is no trust involved because "multisig".

Pooling transactions is more efficient than not. If the block size limit isn't raised and it becomes *necessary* to be efficient, pooled transactions would become popular. Perhaps the miner's fee could be crowdfunded by participating individuals, or paid to the CoinJoin maker as part of the CoinJoin contract. It should be fully possible to program a client side wallet that would take care of the signing part for people. If there were millions of Bitcoin users, and you *had* to CoinJoin to send BTC, the liquidity would be amazing and dropouts wouldn't be so bad. Just wait 1 min and retry.

Yeah, but they aren't demanding full nodes because it's TOO TAXING to run a full node! Average Joe has no choice but to use SPV. I know this because running ONE full node driven by CLI is too taxing for *me*, and I am NOT an average computer user.
I use *top end hardware* for my nodes, btw, so I'm just not hearing these BS anecdotes from randoms about how they can "easily" run a full node on their ten year old laptop. It really is HARD to do - and if full nodes aren't good enough for Average Joe, then only COMPANIES will run them! And if only COMPANIES run full nodes, then control over the Bitcoin network DE FACTO belongs the government.
Block size is fundamentally about who CONTROLS Bitcoin. It can be individuals, or it can be the government.
Who controls Bitcoin is COMPLETELY dependent upon how easy it is for INDIVIDUALS to run full nodes *anonymously*. The government can always force companies to do their bidding, but anonymous individuals distributed all around the world are much more difficult to bargain with.
I have been at this for YEARS. I am telling you, straight up, Bitcoin full nodes are simply TOO TAXING to run unless you're either a company or a dedicated expert. To make it even HARDER to run a full node is just incredibly, incredibly short sighted.
The VERY WORST CASE, if we do nothing, is the network becomes bogged down OVER THE SHORT TERM. No long term damage is even possible.

From a GUI perspective, full nodes are WOEFULLY UNPREPARED for mainstream users - the situation is even worse GUI wise than it is for CLI usage. There are *literally* **two*, GUI full nodes IN THE WORLD: Bitcoin QT and Armory, that is the polar opposite of decentralization.
- It takes too long to start a node *on high end hardware* - there is a good three minute delay as the node attempts connecting to peers - this is BEFORE syncing
- It takes too long to sync a node - at least a half day on a high speed connection. It literally takes longer to setup a full node than it does to install Windows 7 on a ten year old Windows XP machine
- It takes too much CPU to sync a node - CPU usage jumps above 70% *on high end hardware*
- It takes too much disk space to sync a node
This is all very bad for individual users. And remember, these stats are for ONE node. God help you if you want to run several nodes.
And if it's this bad for individuals, COMPANIES will be the ones to pick up the slack. And *if* only companies can pick up the slack, the GOVERNMENT will effectively control Bitcoin because ALL companies are subservient to regulators.
You want to talk about increasing resource requirements even further. That is just utter fucking insanity.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:16:36
I understand and it's my dream for all organizations no matter how small to be able to run full nodes on their own in-house hardware. Without it, you can't *do* interesting things like Counterparty for example wouldn't practically speaking be possible at all - unless a corporation beholden to shareholders who are presumably publicly accountable entities - buy into that idea.
My question to people in favor of a freeze, when will syncing the FULL blockchain take less than 10 seconds on, let's say a recent Apple Macbook Pro laptop on Google Fiber? With using no more than 1% of CPU.
If under the best conditions, it can't accomplish those two things, it is too stressful for most users to run, and developers have problems with it too. I just don't understand your unrelenting passion for freezing the blocksize: please enlighten us, if you would.

That you *can* run an Electrum server doesn't mean anything in practice if average joe can't run it. And he won't because setting up Electrum server is a NIGHTMARE even for an expert. You have to download a bootstrap DB from the foundry, and it literally takes the Electrum maintainers *weeks* to build ONE bootstrap DB on dedicated servers with SSD and copious amounts of RAM. In a full node configuration, Electrum is even MORE taxing than a full node alone.
How many Electrum servers are there in the world, including private servers? 200? 100?
And to think, this at a 1MB block size limit, at block number 355,555. I can only imagine how bad things will get when the block size limit is 20MB and we're at block number 3,555,550.
ANYONE at any time should be able to switch over to running a GUI full node at zero cost, with no setup costs, and a minimum of investment. Until that is possible, Bitcoin is simply getting ahead of itself.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:46:13
I agree with the principle of increasing the block size, but I wouldn't be surprised if most bitcoin accepting merchants come to rely on centralized API providers like BlockCypher, or block explorers run by BitPay, Coinbase and other payment processors. In the best case, the merchant would use Electrum, because doing so would be supporting a federated network of full nodes rather than full nodes run by a Bitcoin bank or broker, as those companies will be heavily regulated and could be pressured in all kinds of subtle ways.
is correct: Bitcoin *client* development is easy. Full node development OTOH, is the polar opposite. There are only a handful of cleanly reimplemented full nodes, and there is presumably little to no adoption of anything outside of Bitcoin Core or btcd. Libbitcoin has improved significantly as well, but it's risky to have full nodes being predominantly deployed by companies. Companies are necessarily subservient to regulators, and developers subservient to their users. Threatening decentralization of full nodes is risking it all on THESE companies, who will become full node gatekeepers. I repeat, how many companies are using anything besides centralized APIs or in-house APIs built on Bitcoin Core?  Mike is correct, Bitcoin CLIENTS are easy, but full nodes are not, and neither is getting full nodes adopted. Only within the last *month* was Libbitcoin able to link Bitcoin Core's consensus lib, which is of paramount importance but just goes to show how nascent the market for full nodes is. It should also reveal that things in Bitcoin are heading in a direction that looks unfamiliar to many.
Fundamentally, Bitcoin QT could be given a nicer user interface with support for wallet seeds. Just to reiterate, if you thought Bitcoin client development was sufficiently decentralized, can you point to a single example of a GUI full node application besides Bitcoin Core or Armory?  That is count em: *two* open source GUI full nodes. Neither of them are even *close* to being ready for usage by the general public. I would call this the opposite of decentralized, unless you're a believe in Electrum. Because if Electrum's client-server SPV mode doesn't become widely used, most full nodes WILL be run by regulated middlemen. The buck stops with the full node, *not* with SPV.
The problem is running a full node is ALREADY heavily taxing on the CPU and bandwidth. No GUI full node is instant on. Bitcoin QT doesn't even support wallet seeds. It's utterly unusable by the public, yet it's one of TWO widely adopted full nodes. The only counterforce between that and complete centralization is the good will of the Bitcoin developers to uphold unchallengeable objectively beneficial and extremely highly scrutinized technical standards.
If you support simplicity, then isn't the simplest action taking *no* action? It's unquestionably too much trouble to run a full node today in an average personal computing environment. If Satoshi thought people SPV clients would be a panacea, he was saying so back when 1 BTC cost less than $10, and when it didn't look remotely possible for Bitcoin's to succeed anywhere near so quickly and astronomically. In addition, Bitcoin was in a very gray legal area and the amount of agora projects was considerably higher. Perhaps we were just ignorant back then, but times have changed.
Considering you are risking Bitcoin's decentralization, I would fully expect you and Gavin to present documented evidence of Bitcoin mainnet or even *testnet* becoming overwhelmed due to blocks being overfull. My subjective experience has been saving bitcoin more than spending it. When people say they're in support of seeing what happens, it's because **we know Bitcoin's network effect for savers will remain intact no matter how bogged down the network gets.** What's not so sure is what would happen if it's no longer possible for an unfunded entrepreneur to set up his own full node. Is it right to think of "100% trustless" Bitcoin services, full nodes, as being out of the reach of the average person? If so, then Bitcoin makes it inevitable for the individual to lose power AGAIN to companies and therefore the government.
Most people simply save their bitcoin, never spending it. The main property of Bitcoin is its limited supply and **arguable** decentralization.
That is what is at stake here! If Bitcoin is centralized, who cares if the network doesn't get bogged down ever? Which altcoin is going to biting at Bitcoin's tail if it gets bogged down but remains the most highly documented, secure and private solution that is guaranteed to be impervious to government attempts at meddling with the protocol. Hard forking Bitcoin Core to change the block size limit fundamentally makes it fair game for the government to compel Bitcoin Core developers to hard fork the supply limit and increase it beyond 21,000,000. This is a REALISTIC, highly dangerous existential threat to Bitcoin.
Getting bogged down at payments isn't a world ending scenario for savers- and if it is Gavin should be able to present hard evidence quantifying the true risks. Making network wide decisions doesn't deserve to be relegated to social media blather - Bitcoin is essentially a corporation and we are all its shareholders. If a company were to communicate internally like this, it would be utter pandimonium, because these decisions could never be made without hierarchy. Either the real Satoshi Nakamoto takes a stand on this issue, or it's without question his intent not to care about the individual's ability to run a full node in an anti-state manner. By hard forking Bitcoin Core to concentrate full nodes in the hands of regulated middlemen, you can no longer prove that Bitcoin would survive a regulatory crackdown, or that the supply cap wouldn't be raised above 21,000,000.
Network effect is more deciding than any other factor when it comes to a cryptocurrency's adoption. Will Bitcoin still have a network effect if the payment network predictably fails requiring users to resend with a transaction with a higher fee? That sounds like a trivial programming challenge, doesn't it? Bitcoin would still be in a different universe compared to fiat currencies in the very worst case.
IANAL, but this withholding a hard fork demonstrates the Bitcoin Core protocol cannot be hard forked by committee, which is a very powerful assurance for fungibility. If there are no hard forks, it legally is much more difficult for anyone to compel the bitcoin developers to change the protocol in hard forking respects.
SPV is not a silver bullet! Full nodes still aren't going away, and if it's hard to run them, that is a serious problem for individuals who want a truly P2P currency. Full nodes are a million times harder to implement than client wallets - and close to impossible to see widely adopted by the market.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:09:44
It's ALREADY too taxing to run a full node on consumer hardware. There needs to be NO perceived cost to running a full node before we even start talking about raising the resource requirements even further beyond the grasp of the individual.

Exactly. Which is why cryptosecurities can't be traditional companies.
The only workable option is to take a video poker game public - one that lives on the blockchain. Rumor has it, it's got a 1% rake which gets paid out to shareholders as a dividend. You verify it yourself, because the full source code lives on the blockchain and can be provably synced to your computer P2P before you ever buy in.
The possibilities of it are what excites me the most:
1. Stocks of big revenue generating blockchain software programs could be *more* stable than BTC.
2. You could buy cryptosecurities on a decentralized exchange without having to give up any information or entrust your BTC to a centralized company
3. You could be anyone, living anywhere in the world and take a blockchain software program public.
Casino games and global lotteries would be a solid first step.
As an asset class, the revenue model would feature extremely limited sovereign risk. Big companies have to deal with regulators gone awry, but the blockchain does not. Risk of civil asset forfeiture would be *slashed*.
And amazingly, since the video poker game would have a real revenue stream, it would be possible to model its profitability. I guarantee you it's easier to sell cryptosecurities to Average Joe *for this reason alone*, and the result could be a HUGE boost in Bitcoin's popularity. You'd have to store the cryptosecurities in a Bitcoin wallet, after all...
It'd be like stock trading, for people who want lower hurdles to making investments, or less risk of civil asset forfeiture, or who can't discount the chance of the government making their business illegal. I imagine this would be a bigger deal in China and countries with restrictive governments. The result, you could model the profitability of a blockchain video poker program much more easily tthan could model the price of BTC. This *really* matters for attracting investors. You could literally point someone to the code showing that a certain stock does this in its code *here* to produce revenue, and it pays dividends in its code *there*.
