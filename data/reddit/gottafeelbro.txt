Do you guys think the current FIFA world cup or upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics would have any impact on Bitcoin's adoption and price?

In Tokyo, yes.

I think we have survived the crash again. All we need now is a rumour/news, something like, Elon Musk is launching satellites to mine bitcoins in the space. To the moon!

It's me actually. Early Jan was not the best time to start investing in this market! (facepalm)

I invested a little in early Jan, and I am holding up at more than 70% losses right now. In fact, I am having a bit of fun in this fall. Never invested in anything that would fall so quickly. Is it bad that I'm enjoying this?

Everybody says to invest in bitcoin only what we can afford to lose. If we believe that, and that everybody is really investing only what they can afford to lose, there is $470B at spare in this world. Imagine all the good it could do. But instead we choose to gamble!

Just wondering, if somebody dies during this fall, like out of heart attack, what would happen to the crypto owned by them? Do people have nominees for their crypto stock?

I am holding on to some losses from January and February purchases and want to invest a little more in BTC. When do you think would be a good time? Is there another major dip expected? Any whales around here to answer my question?

What happened to the company which was paying its employees in Bitcoin? Can this EVER become a valid currency?
