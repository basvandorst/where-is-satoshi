Humans are famously bad at predicting the future of technologies.
We tend to overestimate technology’s abilities in the near-term, and massively underestimate what it can do in the long term.
The shape of that curve has come to be known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, and the five stages of that curve are important for any entrepreneur or investor to understand.
Public excitement and anticipation of every technology, be it artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, or blockchain, follow a similar path.
Innovation trigger --&gt; Peak of inflated expectations: When entrepreneurs (scientists) first create a new technology, they get excited about the hypothetical applications, seeing all of the future potential with few of the downsides. At that moment, hype starts to build an unfounded excitement and inflated expectations. Entrepreneurs’ optimism and imagination outpace reality.
Trough of disillusionment: When these inflated expectations begin to die down, and the entrepreneurs, media and financial markets begin to lose hope, we enter the trough of disillusionment. This is when people lose faith in the technology, even while the underlying technology continues its exponential growth.
Slope of enlightenment: Here, the continuous march of exponential doubling finally catches up with and surpasses early anticipation and expectations. Now the product enters the slope of enlightenment, and we start to see rapid advancements that can surpass even our wildest expectations.
Plateau of productivity: Finally, once the growth starts to slow down and mature, we enter the plateau of productivity. Here, abundant revenue is generated and we start to take the product for granted.

Bitstamp

I guess you have received $10 worth bitcoin because of your referral link and you didn't transfer it to your wallet. 
Important Notice:
"Unfortunately we can't guarantee payout on every account you refer due to the limitations mentioned above and risk of fraud, but we make a good faith effort to do so whenever possible.

Just don't buy on Revolut. I read some bad reviews about it.

r/btc promotes Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:06:33
Bitstamp works great with Ledger nano s.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:20:39
Bitcoin cash is Bcash. BCH. Sh**cash.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:47:31
I guess it takes longer than usual as more and more people are joining coinbase &amp; gdax. Nothing else to do but wait :/
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:58:17
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:50
it is free only if you deposit btc to your own gdax account. 
Go to gdax&gt;deposit from coinbase&gt;withdraw free for any bitcoin wallet address
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:24
Within 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:18:12
True but cryptocurrencies are here to stay. There is no going back :) As bitcoin has the largest user base, I assume it will be the  coin in any aspect.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:08:40
Google Jaxx reset cache. Proceed with caution.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:39:37
Use Bitstamp instead.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:43:00
Do you have the phrase when you created your jaxx wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:58
Coinbase&gt;Gdax&gt;your segwit wallet that starts with number 3 (like greenaddress) if you transfer for free

S9’s price goes up when bitcoin price increases. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:23:58
first download the chrome apps for the ledger nano s. 
everything you need is here:
If you have your bitcoins on coinbase, first deposit them to gdax for free and then send it to your wallet address on ledger nano s for free.

Thanks for this. As a merchant who sells stickers for Macbooks, I offer 40% OFF: $2.99 instead of $4.99 until midnight on Monday. Happy shopping!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:13:08
Thanks a lot for the suggestion :)

I was looking sth like this. Thanks for mentioning the app.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:23:55

@_date: 2017-11-21 12:09:07
No, you don't have to buy from the maker's website. All Nano ledgers are tamper proof. Mine does not even work without its original usb cable so feel safe.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:01:12
Could you please add my website too?

Bitcoin core is the application running on people’s computers to secure the network. Each application is a “node”.
