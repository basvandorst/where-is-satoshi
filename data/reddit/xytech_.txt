You can get to the registration screen from there, but when trying to register you'll get an error saying registrations are closed.

Binance is on maintenance right now. It should be back on in ~20 minutes or so. Meanwhile deposits/withdrawals/trading are suspended.

Those 30€ will cover the transaction cost, but you won't be getting many satoshis for it.
And really, don't bother with such a low amount. It would've been great 9 years ago, but can't expect the same kind of growth at this point in time.

With creditcard, Bitstamp. With bank transfer I like Luno, though have seen others give it bad reviews.

Best exchange rates and lowest fees as far as I'm aware. But if you don't want to use it, why not Bitstamp?

I'd have to log in to check and CBA right now. It might work, try to click deposit on the USD page and see the options. Wouldn't make any difference though, as moving between Coinbase and GDAX is instant and free anyways.

There's no fees. Moving from Coinbase to GDAX is instant and free. Moving from GDAX to elsewhere is not instant but it's free.

Yes. Send a bank transfer to Coinbase, then move it to GDAX. If possible, send USD. USD prices are WAY lower than EURO prices on Coinbase/GDAX. I just found this out recently so I've yet to test if I can send USD instead. Moving to GDAX from Coinbase is instant and free.
For instance. Current BTC/EUR price is 12900. Translate 12900 EUR into USD and that's 15500, but the BTC/USD price is 14600. This was even worse earlier today.
