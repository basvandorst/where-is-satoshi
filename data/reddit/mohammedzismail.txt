On a more serious note, I'm in the same position friend. I'm only able make purchases using my card, via coinbase (not the best). Though I appreciate the verification process, it is, as  states, frustrating. Are there any other exchanges that require the same verification steps as coinbase?

Is there an estimate how much this can mine if left to mine in optimal conditions for a month straight?

I don't pay for electricity. It's included in the rent, but I do appreciate your point about the cpu burning up.

It's not a "sneaky plot" haha. I have free electricity.
