Alltough, I should admit that there was a point in the 2013 exchange rate run up, where I briefly swapped bitpay to settle in euros for me. I did it only as risk management and it ended up being the correct move.
@_date: 2015-12-05 05:40:04
My small business only converts to euros for taxation reasons, then buys back the next day. I can prettymuch use bitcoin for any expense out there, but the charges for doing so are often fairly high.

For btctrinkets merchandice manifacturers 2/5 accept it atm, will be 3/6 very soon. Ive been gradually pushing the issue on the manifacturer I most use for over a year now, but cant seem to make any progress which is really frustrating. But I dont want to be too agressive about it. The remaining two manifacturers are ones I've worked with once or twice so far and I feel it's too early.
Other than the merchandise itself, I do pay for stamps and hosting via bitcoin. Phone and isp bills with fiat.

As a vaper and a bitcoiner I have come to the realization that bitcoin penetration could be at it's highest among any industry in electronic cigarettes. This is quite natural, both technologies have been developed and have matured roughly in the same time period. I myself refuse to make any vaping related purchases using credit cards or fiat anymore and it is in no way limiting the products available to me.

I personally (as a miner) embraced the upcoming changes in two ways: I did purhase an asic and I started a buisness producing and selling bitcoin nieche items. I might recieve my asic this year, but after being in buisness for 3 weeks my trinket sales have allready triumphed my mining revenues. At current I am running 7,5Gh/s and Im stating to think that I might not be interested in investing more in to asics as I had intended.

I've tried becoming a linux user several times in the past 10 years, most recently I had to ask a friend to help with my laptops mouse buttons, I wanted to swap them and the gui software just would not work as it was supposed. My frien ended up writing an ugly hack to swap the buttons on startup... and this is a person charge of Youtube's uptime atm so it's not like he cant handle the latest ubuntu with gnome.
Linux is just not for me and assuming it is for everyone is the sort of notion that most certainly hinders bitcoin adoption.

Trading fee on Huobi USD is only 0.1% from October 8th to October 31th(50% discount of the original trading fee 0.2%) . From November 1st, your trading fee rate will be calculated based on your trading volume from October 2nd to October 31st.

- reindex ended up crashing after a minute or or so, windows notifying that the program has stopped working and will be shut down. - rescan ended up opening properly but failed to find the block files, so I am currently re-downloading the entire blockchain. This is an acceptable solution for me, feels like a waste but I hate tinkering with a program this important when I do not always exactly know what I am doing. I suppose after this is done I will be swapping to a more lightweight client as I nolonger mine and my e-commerse does not require for me to maintain a full node. That you for you assistance.

I did consider getting bitcoin themed usb drives, but two things worked against me: 
1. At rougly the same time I was looking in to it and getting quotations from manufacturers someone else in the bitcoin community brought similiar goods to the market. In respect of said indivisuals endeavor I did not wish to start competing with him. For the same reason I have refraned from producing t-shirts and bumper stickers.

Your coins are still there, your bitcoin QT-just has not caught up with the blockchain. It is not reccomended for everyone to use the full client, because the blockchain is huge and growing by the day. But since you allready moved the funds you propably should just let it work trough. The other option is to export the wallet to another lighter client.  TLDR: There not gone.

Yes the escrow is only relesed when the buyer does so, usually upon recieving the goods... alltough sometimes you have to sen reminder messages. I find it a bit worrying that the escrow is in anonymous hands, but I should also state that I have not had a single problem using the site with ~20 transactions. My goods have ranged fro 0.7 to ~ 25 btc in a single trade.

When mining costs more than it produces, some miners will quit mining. This will lower the difficulty, which in turn makes mining more profitable. It's a beautiful system and works spledidly.
The 21 million coin limit will be "hit" at around 2140, way before that transaction fees will suprpass the block reward. After that point miners will simply mine for tx-fees.

Yes, much less cost efficient. The whole point of my response (and may similiar ones before) is to get the person contemplating investing to fully understand what the factors involved are, before proceeding to search for products. Since your in the UK I would suggest you keep taps on enterpoint, something could be available or coming. But please be sure your investment is based on solid math. For example up to recently I did my estimates with cumulative 10% increases in difficulty every two weeks, now the same figure is 15%.

My trinkets, I see absoluteley no reason to accept fiat for them as anyone who would be interested in them allready has bitcoin. 
I cannot give another example, but I do have a strong feeling I can't be the only one going this way. I am anxiously waiting for the day when I can produce new items and pay for them in bitcoin so I can get rid of the dollar based pricing, but I have to admit this may be several years from now. But who knows, from my perspective the passing of time has most certainly been accelerating.

I started my own bitcoin venture with very little capital, bitcoin signifigantly lowers the amount of time needed and more than anything the running costs. After about five months in buisness four out of five custom items I have in stock have been paid in full and my monthly operating costs are below 5$. Even if I dont see any sales for a month Im perfectly fine. I strongly believe this would be a completeley different story if I worked with traditional payment systems.
@_date: 2013-01-01 16:00:07
I have to admit that posting the items here seperateley and on separate days was a devious plan, getting attention without being a spamming moron is sofar the hardest part... and I dont want to spam. I can promise that there arent any more new items rolling out right away, actually I have some feelers out for new manufacturers and products but nothing deceisive so far. Incase someone has an awesome idea feel free to pitch I've so far been giving the item 50% off to for whoevers idea it was once/if I endu up getting it out.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:53:46
Hear, hear. I myself (miner and bitcoin entrepenur) try to use  a third of my btc income to grow my buisness (directly with bitcoin payments when possible, conversion to fiat when not), save a third and spend a third. I've been concerned for some time that bitcoin is only being hoarded and might end up in a bubble that could possibly set wider adoption back several years, thus even hurting the hoarders.

Both are available, I also have a metal (silver) coloured tie clip with the same bitcoin emblem on it, just havent gotten around to taking pictures of it yet. I hate it when "the wife" is traveling with her camera when I get new goods, making do with my cellphone is hard :)

On the contrary I do not accept fiat in any form. As I am not that tech savy I have not up to date found a tool that would allow me to display dynamic bitcoin prices in the Prestashop powered store.

It was suggested/requested by my customers so I delivered. I had little faith in the product, but it looks like the first batch will eventually be sold out, so I guess it made sense. I do wish that a second batch is never needed, because cash a concept that belongs in the past.

Prices redone due to the exchange rate moving up, but while I was doing "the math" I came to realize that I had met my return of investment on the design and mold costs of my three first items. Because of this the price drops there are larger. 
Current prices stand at:
Keychain 1.08BTC

Lapel pin 1.03BTC

As a merchant who uses Mt.gox as a payment gateway I find this interesting and alarming. In my limited experience something like this happens when the exchange rate lowers while the transaction confirms. I suggest my customers overpay slightly, which mtgox refunds automaticly when the payment goes trough.

Exactly, when we reach a point where a bitcoin merchant can cover all or most of it's operating costs without converting to fiat, then we truly have a functioning bitcoin economy. My small venture managed to break the cycle this week regarding purchasing stamps.

A silver coloured version would be easy.. just a matter of producing and shipping. But one made of actual silver is a whole other story. The bottom line is that I do not trust my manufacturer to use the material they claim, back when I first started off they claimed the products made for me were gold plated. I never believed that and did not market the goods as containing any gold. I've been talking to some jewlers locally but the quotations I keep getting are rediculously high.

Im going to go against my instinct and assume your not trolling: Bitcoin is run on thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands computers around the world. If your referring to a single bitcoin wallet then there are numerous ways to protect ones wealth. I for example only have a few present of my bitcoins online, the rest are offline. The coins I do have online are stored in an encrypted wallet with a passphrase that is 36 characters long and does not contain a single word of any language, so bruteforcing it is out of the question. This does leave me somewhat open to keyloggers, but I cannot foresee the circumstances where one could get installed on my computer.

At the current phase bitcoin is in the solution is to base product prices on an another currency, in my businesses case it's the euro. I do hope that things will stabilize in the coming years, but while bitcoin has only reached some fragments of a percent of its potential volatility is perfectly expected and even  by my consideration acceptable.

This is for euro notes, coming from an ex-blackjack dealer who worked with cash, without any technical aids for detenting counterfits.
Feel the money, the wrong feel of its surface will reveal the crudest forgeries and even some good ones if the paper is wrong.
Check for a hologram.
Check for the watermark and while your holding the bill against a light, check for the magnetic stripe in the middle of the bill.
When accepting multiple bills of a same denomination: quickly glance to see that their serial numbers differ.
If you have 10/10 vision you can also see that some of the graphics on each note are made up by text. Sadly I have lost this ability over the years myself, but it's not an essential check.

@_date: 2013-03-28 16:22:39
Well ofcourse you need to find a way to provide something that makes sense with your personal skillset. In my case it came down to producing and selling some bitcoin niche items. The major point for me is I have something at point to whenever I hear "you cant buy anything with bitcoin" or "bitcoin is backed by nothing". Imho every single service provider and retailer out there is what is "backing" bitcoin.
Depending on what you end up offering you can sell the service/goods for fiat also, just making bitcoin a payment option along others.. in this case be sure to pass the transaction cost of middlemen to your customers. In my case it made sense to accept bitcoin as the only form of payment.
I also offered to recieve up to 50% of my salary in bitcoin, that did shut up my employer on how "he has no use for bitcoin".

I put about a third away so I can possibly some day own my own island with palm trees and everything. But I understand that the path there is long and requires much work from many individuals, so another third I invest back in to bitcoin trough my small bitcoin niche item buisness or mining hardware. Mostly my buisness lateley, mining is becoming way too competitive. The remaining third I spend on whatever I need and want without converting it in to conventional currencies.

 Every new user, be it a merchant, consumer, saver or speculator adds to the stability. So does every exchange, Im willing to bet we are about to see the face of the exchange market change in the coming months and I doubt any exchange will evere have as large portion of the trade Mt. Gox now does, akso services like Bitinstant are going to see competitors spur up. This atleast to some extent removes volatility caused by service disruptions. 
 When, I do not know, but the pace bitcoin seems to move forward is far from slow. At what price is irrelevant solong as it just happens. How stable, daily fluctuation of the exchange rate remaining under 5% is what I consider stable these days, wouldn't mind less tough. In the long run a steady deflation, but most likeley the rise will coenside with positive bitcoin related news.

If you/your site can generate a a cart then you could use atleast the following: mtgox, bitpay, bips. All of them let you use direct conversion, most of them offer you to setup what % gets converted to dollars. All of them have various shopping cart plugins.. and I atleast dont see why you couldn't just set up a system where you generate the cart yourself and email it to the client.

Especially because of your average order value it would make sense accepting bitcoin. Do a cost comparison versus your current payment methods, I'd be supprised if you wouldnt be able to increase profits trough it or to offer a discount over other payment methods.
I myself run a bitcoin accepting ecommerce, but because of the nature of my goods I went in a very different direction with payments: I only accept bitcoin. The only time I convert to conventional currencies is to pay suppliers that do not accept bitcoin or to pay taxes.
I cant say anything about coinbase and their services, havent used them. But the three providers I have worked with, which essentially offer very similiar services, have all delivered what they have promised.

I've been looking in to selling my goods on coingig, my first attempt ended at me submitting three or so bugs and I remember getting a response of atleast some of them being gone now. I will be looking in to the service again at some point. For now I do also operate trough bitmit.net with escrow available.

Reputation is everything in the world of bitcoin. I doubt there are that many buisnesses out there that would be interested in making a quick buck at the cost of their reputation. I for one sure wouldn't. Also bitcoin does require more due-diligence from it's spender. Know the reputation of services and stores you use, at the very least google them. Can they be traced to a person: adress, phone number, domain registrations, tax records and so on.

There are two other incentives: Anonymity, which I personally do not care about. The second is that there are goods available that arent being sold for fiat and I am not referring to anything illegal here.

Wow the obvious misleading shilling in this thread is hilarious, anyone pointing out that the cards are very expensive to use and virtually useless get downwoted, have at me. Your business made my list, never will I transact with or trough Coinkite.
Ps. Im personally in a position in my dayjob to possibly put your devices in to action in a store doing ~4million euros a year in sales. This is not how you conduct business, the way you under estimate this community is dispicable.
Inb4 some time later an official Coinkite representative will undoutably tell us that they had nothing to do with what transpired here. Just ask the question who else would of have orcestrated this.

The merchant/customer adoption is a chicken/egg type dilemma. I think you should ask yourself if you would like bitcoin to reach a point where a substantial amount of customers pay with it ?
If the answer is yes, then accepting bitcoin is what you can and propably should do. Eventually it is even likeley that some companies that could provide your business goods and services for bitcoin at competetive prices will emerge and it is then when you find the "other half" of the financial benefits.
I myself run a small bitcoin only sideventure and after a year I have four "subcontractors" I can pay with bitcoin. One of them manufactures a good I sell, one will sell me stamps with bitcoin, one provides hosting for my e-commerce and one does graphics and product desing for me.
The way bitcoin grows is one person/business at a time. It may seem like a slow crawl, but thinking back the fifteen months I have been in business.. the growth hardly seems all that slow.

I can respond only to the last question, because Im infafiliar with the pool in question.
A valid block is a block that is not orphaned, in other words a block that makes it in to the blockchain. 
The same as bitcoin wiki puts it: "For any block on the chain, there is only one path to the genesis block. Coming from the genesis block, however, there can be forks. One-block forks are created from time to time when two blocks are created just a few seconds apart. When that happens, generating nodes build onto whichever one of the blocks they received first. Whichever block ends up being included in the next block becomes part of the main chain because that chain is longer. "

I personally have used Mt. gox, would I reccomend it: no for now.

You could ask bit-instant for the tx id and see if the coins are still in the same address and if you control the private key to that address then it's only a matter of downloading the blockchain to gain access to them. [edit] Or importing the private key to a wallet that does not require the entire blockhain.

21 Million and yes it's a hard limit. But they are infinitely divisible so it's not a problem.

If you must treat it like a stock then I'd propably focus on adoption indicators like transaction count, address count, search engine statistics and so forth.
The second aspect is the vast potential of bitcoin. But It's had to measure because it's always saying "To the moon!".
