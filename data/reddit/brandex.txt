Everything is "8" here in China, the word is pronounced nearly the same as the word "luck".

It's over 8000.

Because there are 1% of the bullshit varieties of taxes in any other country besides US.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:54:14
Except for Americans. They are taxed by the government no matter were on the planet they live for their entire adult lives, unless they renounce citizenship.

All land in China is owned by the government and only leased to people.

Cassettes were the international standard medium for audio and even data for a great many years. Not even remotely a failure. I can only presume you are too young to have existed when they were the only thing there was that anyone used for a couple decades.

Get off it. I live here, you don't. You clearly do not understand the situation at all.

Whaddya mean? It's getting easier (cheaper) every day!

It's $150000.

He also says it in various language anime translations AND in the American rerelease after they fixed the mistake.

WTF? Train tickets here are about $50 to $100 for inter province. Most of the people using this are the peasant class Nongs. They wouldn't even know what btc is.

I've been an expat for a decade, if I could I would have done it myself. You can't just get another country's citizenship whenever you want. It's expensive to buy a new one.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:22:56
Sure there is, sometimes. 2 days back coin base cancelled my ach bank transfer order to buy btc I had placed a week ago and reversed my funds. Lucky. Something about couldn't verify identity, even though I'm already done with that. Lucked out in the end, so np. I'm basically in the exact situation op is describing, but with a funds reversal on my first buy with them.

Which is why the fastest growing county in the world for many years, China, has hardly any taxes at all? We don't file our own taxes bullshit like in the US, a part of your monthly salary is paid by your company for it  and you never have to think about it yourself. No sales tax, no property tax, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:19:03
School, police, and FD, come from property tax, not income.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:56:53
Look it up on the .gov, I have. If you renounce, you are still NEVER exempt from taxes due while a U.S. Citizen, and still have to file for the 3 years  after renouncing too. This is of course if you ever go back to the US to visit, where you could be grabbed at customs and v eventually.imprisoned for tax evasion.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:14:19
Why? There is no sales tax over here in the world's 2nd largest economy nation.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:28:12
If you had the money I'm sure you would find a way like you are saying. If it were me, I probably wouldn't mind living "poorly" for a few years after renouncing then cashing out too.

There is coinmama, but it's not available in 4 states including mine.

I haven't lived there for Ten years, but the government still owns and taxes me. I'd drop the citizenship if I could, but I don't have the ability/cash to get one in another country.

Yes, because when you are rich AF, you can't just travel anywhere you want with your new passport... Look up buying St. Kitts citizenship.

Clearly, you know nothing about the situation here in China. Also HK is a city, not a province.
With a border.
And different passports.
And require visas/passes for a citizen from either side to cross over to the other one.
And have a different culture from the Mainland.
And have a different 1st and 2nd language from the average Mainlander.
And have different laws.
HK's Umbrella Revolution could NEVER have happened in "China".
