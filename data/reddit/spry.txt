You should probably think about killing yourself

$400 for a $25 raspberry pi -- **and you actually think developers are stupid enough to fall for this scam?** lol

Why does pointing out the flaws of bits-Coin make you so upset?
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:18:17
Thx babe
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:20:32
You're not wrong; I have limited patience for imbeciles

bits-Coin can process 2.7 transactions per second
For comparison Western Union, a single company, processes ~20 transactions per second
Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but bits-Coin is pretty much a punchline

Step 1) Don't intentionally design my digital currency to be a Ponzi scheme
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:36:08
I agree. bits-Coin just cannot scale and is already woefully slow among its other dozens of drawbacks

* Bitcoin XT
* Anything critical of that shitheel * Making mention of that shitheel embezzling hundreds of thousands of bits-coiner funds by paying his college friends &gt;$100,000 to develop arguably the worlds worst forum software, for some inexplicable reason (hint: kickbacks)
Lol, and everyone here loves to promote that bits-coin is "censorship resistant" meanwhile only mod-approved topics can be discussed like "wow guys we r going to moon! pump Pump PUMP!!"

Solid scam you're running there, chief

Centralized systems can and do stop this by never requiring an absurd 'reputation' system in the first place. The system specified here is blatantly broken before even in use.
It took this rando commenter you replied to all of 2 seconds to realize the massive, fatal flaw in your shitty thesis, guy. How long do you think it will take bit-Coin's legions of scammers and fraudsters?


The fuck? How exactly, O captain my captain of industry, are you intending on differentiating between a legit transaction and a fraudulent one. **Oh, that's right, you're not.** You're just waving your hands desperately trying to make it seem like a non-issue, per usual with low-technical goons like yourself.
