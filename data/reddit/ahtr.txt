It makes no sense for anyone to get a bit coin denominated loan due to its volatile trading ratio and because there is almost nothing denominated in btc to make good use of the loan.

botnets would make money from bitcoins, so why would they try to crash it. The author fails on so many levels. I think what went in the head of the author is that : "well, hepr derp, botnets crash everything; they crash computers, they crash web servers with ddos, they will crash bitcoins". Well, no, botnets operators wont crash their source of income silly.

Do you think the CIA would waste their known TOR weakness on drugs, rather than say a foreign government secret?

Gold can be confiscated way more easily by sending the swat to where ever the gold wharehouse happens to be. Or like most government, simply send a letter with a SIGNATURE on it  to the wharehouse telling them to freeze the gold account. Don't even have to send the police these days.
@_date: 2012-09-06 18:36:39
Then you would have gotten an invalid bitcoin address to which you could not send coins to.
@_date: 2012-11-06 19:58:29
No because there will always be people who complain that they lost their keys and that they want to cancel the old ones and use a new one. Therefore the fraud or potential for fraud will be concentrated in the key assignment, cancellation and generation process.

its easy once you have some and are getting paid in btc.

Direct from the author:


is a breach of Gresham's Law: stolen electricity will drive out honest mining. This has unfortunate effects for the
stability of the Bitcoin economy, and the result is inevitable collapse.
There, I win. Thanks for playing.

"lets exchange profit togather!!!!!"
@_date: 2012-03-09 02:12:27
first of all, its only fraud if they dont inform the public. However every bank in the world publicly claims to be a fractional reserve bank right now. There is no reason to believe a bitcoin bank will try to hide the fact that it is using fractional reserve form its clients.
@_date: 2012-02-19 23:12:18
smart guy, in 10 months the mining reward will drop by half making all this shit worthless. He is smart for selling first.

Still better than a democracy, since the people who vote are those who are familiar with and are invested in the technology and its success, and not joe smuck on welfare.

@_date: 2012-02-23 19:02:26
Ah good, let us spend the better part of the day arguing about the significance of the fact that you brought in, instead of the fact itself. That is even more relevant to my interests.

The amount of currency produced by mining is not dependent on the difficulty: 50btc/10min

@_date: 2012-04-28 04:52:40
Can you let me know if you are still working on it?
@_date: 2012-01-17 15:40:37
No, because they want their government to capture all the powers the bank have and use it to give them free shit. Bitcoins will prevent that, so OWS is against bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-08-05 18:19:22
it means you don't have to gamble with your retirement money.
@_date: 2012-06-28 05:23:31
yeah they even have a website, no way this can go wrong.
@_date: 2012-06-29 14:57:19
He admitted that he was.
@_date: 2012-05-16 00:09:12
probably they can't figure out how to prevent fraud so they shut it down.
@_date: 2012-09-09 10:40:16
The major problem with bitcoin right now is lack of exposure. Not that its legal or illegal.

What if its done voluntarily?
@_date: 2012-12-11 04:25:39
What do you think the bots upload to the tor hidden service? Answer: nothing. The tor hidden services is used to send orders to the bot. The bot sends a http request to the "order.php" page of the hidden service to read their orders.

@_date: 2012-03-04 05:16:06
This gives me an idea: Get paid to read reddit, could be really cool way to go mainstream with bitcoins. But, how to make money?
@_date: 2012-03-05 22:59:04
51% or more of the mining power can kill the technology. That is the definition of democracy.
@_date: 2012-02-23 07:07:03
I have. I am thinking about it. It would generate about 4000$ per month at current difficulty/hashing. I am just not sure how long the device will last. If it breaks after 1 or 2 years, then it might not be worth it to me.

they used paypal and western union... wtf..

you can buy stolen credit card numbers on the tor network. But the problem has always been to convert the numbers to actually untraceable value. I assume most of your sales were done by thief monetizing the stolen cc. Did you ever tried the verified by visa and/or 3d-secure programs?
@_date: 2012-12-11 04:38:34
bots are used to DDOS, to remote mine, or sending spam, ad spam clicking, etc. Data gathering is useless for a bot. Bots are not trying to steal your torrents, or to build a profile in order to serve you targeted ads.

why not? Seems like they help out making sure all the exchanges are well funded and that their prices are current.
@_date: 2012-08-14 16:41:30
Yeah. They will just instruct their media buffoons to report that bit coins are a scam thats why it was banned. Then anymore who comes to the defend of but coins, people will just assume they profit from the scam.
@_date: 2012-01-18 03:26:24
Can you explain it like I was 5? What is bitcoinica, what is the impact of this?
@_date: 2012-01-22 17:18:13
It just mean that both people can spend the money associated with the address. And if one spends the money, the money will be retracted from the other person's wallet. (Same thing happens when someone makes a copy of your wallet file).
