Was hoping to use Bitcoin directly, avoid exchange fees, skip the few days it takes to convert. Plus it ups the cool factor a little.

That is awesomesauce, but it would be a lie to put a 'paid with bitcoin' sticker if I didn't, and there seems to be no seller that accepts bitcoin. Are you selling the book at any events, and do you accept bitcoin transfer as payment? I don't want to contribute to the devaluing of the authenticity of that sticker if I can come by it honestly.

How do I get a fancy signed copy and a paid with bitcoin, first print first edition sticker?  is fresh out but points to O'Reilly and amazon, neither accepts bitcoin.

Not too many options where I work but I will make this happen. I might have to buy a gift card from gyft.com with bitcoin, still counts.

Alright, heres the new plan. Headed to gyft.com, buying an amazon gift card with bitcoin, buying the book. Bringing that book to an event, where I will have earned the right to sport the now coveted sticker. Get the sticker, get the sig, get the achievement points for completing this mission on difficulty setting:High. I appreciate that you were willing to bend the rules for me, please feel free to share this roundabout method of buying with bitcoin!

Its important to note that you *can* continue to use the same address, it is yours forever. If you printed it or stuck it on a website for donations it will continue to work. It's just since the address is publicly viewable, as are all bitcoin addresses, using only one address would make it very easy for anyone to see everything you do with your bitcoin. Changing the address up every transaction makes that much more difficult.

To the kind individual that gave me gold, thank you and I apologize for taking a month to say so. I didn't realize I *had* been given gold until it warned me it was expiring just now. That was my first gold, thank you!

I will take one, sending PM.
