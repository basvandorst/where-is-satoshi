Houses are interesting assets. Generally your house depreciates and will need regular maintenance and updates to retain value. The thing that actually goes up is the land (if its in a desirable location of course).
At best after 10 years of home ownership by my best calculations I have about broke even. In 10 more years it should be paid off and start to be more positive but by then it will need some renovations. 
Overall kind of neutral. I think some people see the current value vs. the initial sales price and think they are doing great, but they don't actually account for all the costs of insurance, interest and maintenance. 
For actual investing I much prefer stocks or other financial instruments like bitcoin. I could buy a flat and rent it out but honestly that seems like way to much work. Just doing some painting and light remodeling around my own house I've realized I don't really enjoy that kind of work... much rather make some spreadsheets.

The purpose of bitcoin is you can do whatever the hell you want with it without someone else’s permission. 
If people want to horde it, you can’t stop them. 
If people want to trade it, you can’t stop them. 
If people want to use it for daily transactions, you can’t stop them. 
Instead of repeating “not your keys, not your bitcoin” the mantra should be simply “your bitcoin”
The way I see it there is no “correct” usage of bitcoin. It is freedom to do whatever you want with it.

It doesn’t exist yet. Hence the announcement. It will basically be like holding gold in an Ira. Has to be with an approved ETF or exchange.

This ETF is just bundling the CBOE futures. I don't think it will have a huge effect on the price. Nice pump for sure if it happens though.

found this: [
"According to the SEC filing, the ETF is expected to IPO for 1m total shares. Each share is worth one-fifth of a bitcoin, which would mean that the trust controls 200,000 BTC and [at recent prices]( would be worth roughly $87 per share."
So theirs was targeted at smaller investors. 
also this:
"The Winklevosses revealed their bitcoin investment last year, reportedly owning 1% of all bitcoins in circulation. Based on the digital currency's  total market cap, that would mean the twins jointly own over $50m in BTC."
GAH! I don't even understand what motivates people at this level to keep acquiring more money. Like I just want to pay for my kids education and give them a nice headstart.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:06:15
I think you are correct. Bitcoin is high risk, not a safe haven.

Well said. 
On a much smaller scale this is basically my dilemma with paying off my mortgage early. I have the cash, but it will be better spent invested in something when the mortgage interest is so low. 
Still I can’t just print money, my investments could tank and my job could end. I think I might pat it off then get another mortgage on a rental/vacation house. A 30 year fixed mortgage is one of the only ways the little guys can hedge against inflation. Well that and bitcoin of course.

Right, you may never get anything. Odds are very against you. From what I am reading these USB miners are useless even for pools now. But if you let it run there is a small chance it could solve a block.

1. Proshares is one of the largest ETF companies

@_date: 2018-08-10 01:49:25
Yep started buying again back in may. Just going to keep sweeping whatever’s left at the end of the month into bitcoin. 
I think a lot of people’s idea of investing is buying $1000 of something one time and then they are rich. Slowly adding to something over the long term is the right mindset. If you are not starting with a fat stack it’s really the only way to build wealth. I met so many people that put their tax return into an IRA one year and wonder why they are not millionaires yet. You can’t expect the market to do everything, you need to put some skin in the game. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:27:20

Good for you, I didn't hit me till I was in my 30s. I realized I was a millionaire in several video games but didn't have any real life savings. I started treating budgeting and savings like I did FF potions.

I say thank god for the day traders. Do you have any idea what the price would be without them buying and selling all day?
Do you know how hard it would be to actually buy without an active marketplace?

@_date: 2018-06-28 13:47:25
Well I’m assuming you didn’t invest 98%, but it overtook your other investments? Have you ever done any rebalancing? Or just letting it ride. 
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:42:18
Slightly different but similar plan - acquire at least 2 BTC. If bitcoin goes above 100k then sell one. Put $100k in index fund and let the other one ride. 
Next step is unknown because who the hell knows what is going on to cause this. Re-evaluate and plan next move.

Hmm smells like an audit trap. I don’t recommend lying on your taxes. If you did any transactions with coinbase or similar exchanges I would answer yes.  They most likely already know and will trigger an audit if you lie.

Gold is so silly... but its hard to deny that I would like a brick for myself. :P
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:32:42
Stocks + bitcoin.
To me it seems like bitcoin is becoming or already is "digital gold" its a hedge against the stock market and hyper inflation. It has many advantages over gold, but one drawback - its significantly more risky (volatile) than gold. Depending on your risk tolerance though this can be a plus.
Best bet is to own both. And also some other uncorrelated asset like real estate. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. I actually am looking at buying some gold to add to my stocks, bitcoin, and silver. Also thinking about buying some more land.
@_date: 2019-12-04 02:59:16

Most merchants are not "accepting bitcoin" they are using 3rd party payment proccesors. It's no more bother than adding PayPal or another credit card. 
You might want to actually look into how payment processing systems work before spouting off how its untenable.

So I am now officially in the green on BTC! Been a wild ride, bought my 1st coin on Nov 28th! ($100 worth lol). I made money trading up the bull run, but would of been better off just holding... so thats what I did (after the peak lol). Was down 50% at one point. Started buying again in May.
Onwards and upwards!

You can buy fractional shares of an ETF at most places. An ETF does not have to trade 1 share = price of 1 bitcoin. Each share could be pegged to .1 .01 .0001 Similar to how some companies have different classes of shares. Similar to how each share of my S&amp;P index is $30 not $3000.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:59:24
You haven’t shown anything except you have no idea what you are doing.

@_date: 2018-07-20 14:05:51
Oh believe me I know. I’ve had accounts frozen, assets seized, card transactions declined. Most of this stuff can be cleared up, but you are at the mercy of the bank and the government. 
One thing I have learned is to not keep all of your assets in one bank. It’s one of the reasons I got into bitcoin in the first place.

Thats the thing about fiat money. There is no limit. New money is created everyday from loans. The fed controls the supply by raising or lowering interest rates. Bitcoin cannot be "loaned" from a bank the way that fiat money can be. New supply must be mined by verifying the blockchain. Loaning someone bitcoin means you actually transfer it to them.

Speed is not the only measure of how good a database is. Accuracy and permanence are more desired in some cases.
Bitcoin cannot function truly offline. Gold can be used in any situation. What if a nuke goes off killing the power and telecommunications grid? Bitcoin is worthless and you must get yourself somewhere else quickly. 
This is admittedly a far fetched and not likely scenario, but it is possible. A gold watch or some other jewelry could secure transport or grease the wheels of a border crossing.

You are ignoring productivity gains. The issue you are talking about is wages are not keeping pace with inflation. The problem is not inflation, its that less work is needed, and there are more people. That is what is suppressing wages, not inflation. This is only going to get worse, automation is going to make physical and mental work worthless.

I think Blockchain could be an amazing technology for securing voting machines. I thought I had a brilliant idea but it turns out other people are already working on it. The tech behind it definitely has value and use, the question is how much of that use is actually tied to bitcoin? Bitcoin is worth whatever people will pay for it. It’s value is that people trust it, but that is awfully hard to put a number on. 
Gold is interesting, I keep thinking about buying some not really as an investment but more of a shtf power grid down, have to trade something to get the hell out of here type thing. Gold can be used without power or the internet, and traded “off the books”. Even if none of that happens you at least have some shiny coins to look at. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:06:27
If it reaches ridiculous highs again I would cash out, and immediatly invest that fiat into something else (more) stable like real estate, index fund or similar. Wait for a bit and then buy back in.

I don’t see a huge difference between an ETF and having a coinbase account. It’s just that millions of people already have accounts where they can buy ETFs. 
A lot of people here don’t even like coinbase or other exchanges/custodial accounts but they provide a vital function IMHO.

Cooks do roughy the same amount of work yes, but expand your horizons a little beyond the kitchen. It doesn't take a team of cowboys and ranchers to raise cattle anymore.  There has been a reduction in labour at every step of the food production process. Soon they will replace the burger flippers with robots and all that will be left is the front of house. There will be more people wanting these jobs so their wages will fall relative to inflation even more.

I don't think you understand what is meant by institutional money. An ETF is not about reaching the fat cats. They have personal accountants to sweat the details. By institutional money people mean retail investors with a IRA at e-trade. Its more about mass adoption than hooking one whale.

The government doesn’t just control the monetary system, they have a back door directly to your bank account. 
A few years ago one of my business partners decided to try and evade some taxes. One day I woke up and the IRS had seized 100k out of the LLC account. This could have destroyed my company. Luckily we were able to get it back (and kick him out) but it took about a week. 
Just last week I went to the ATM but my bank decided there was suspicious activity and suspended my debit card. Branch was closed, I couldn’t do anything except wait for Monday and call them. Still waiting for them to ship me a new card. 
You don’t need it, but it can be awful handy when someone else decides you can’t spend your money.

Well I have access to lots of computers that I could format, and never connect to the internet. I also wonder about just using an old phone with the sim removed... but yeah the ease of use might make it worth $100. 
I do kind of worry about it being too secure though. What if you leave it in a safe deposit box then kick the bucket? I’ve unfortunately been dealing with a lot of estates and getting access to stuff is difficult even for normal accounts. If you don’t have the pin or recovery phrases somewhere it would be impossible to get the private key off there right? I feel like you would need to leave detailed instructions somewhere or all your coins would be lost on death.

Because you can put it in your IRA and not pay taxes? Because you can buy it seamlessly with your existing brokerage account? Because you don’t have to worry about security or losing keys?
An ETF will do 2 main things. Legitimize bitcoin as an asset class, and make buying it frictionless for people that don’t understand it, don’t know what a whitepaper is, and have to get their kids to open their email. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:47:57

who the hell buys groceries with cash? I use my phone... its 2018. Why would the cash you can physically carry have any bearing on the limit of inflation?
Then fed prints money when people request debt. This creates growth/inflation. When you have no growth or inflation that is when it becomes dangerous as the existing dollars are not enough to pay back the debt. This is what happened in 2009, big banks suddenly stopped requesting debt. The money supply froze and suddenly no one can pay back their loans.
Yes as you can see this is a bit of a shell game. There is a delicate balance between issuing too much debt and not enough. I struggle to comprehend it all myself because its all a bit more complicated than "the fed prints money with no backing to justify it".

I think the next bubble will touch 100k. Bubble pops -80% back down to 20k. It’s like poetry.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:36:47
sure this is pure extra money. Thinking about going 50% stocks and 50% bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:09:16
can you do a wire transfer? I just looked and I can do $250,000 a day of wire transfers.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:19:39
Probably. I mean I’m not broke but I don’t bet the farm on every possibility that crosses my mind :P
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:14:31
What in the hell lol.

I use Apple pay almost daily... often times I leave my card at home.  
I heard an interesting stat at a marketing talk. More people own a cellphone worldwide than a flush toilet. 
I would not bet against cellphone in some form taking over payments almost completely.

meh seems like some people are selling to jump on the stock market rally today. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:58:08
This crap just annoys me. Figure out your pricing. CC fees are from 1-2%, if you can't work out how to average that into your price what is wrong with you.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:28:13
Um... businesses still have to pay taxes if they accept bitcoin. Using it for tax evasion is not going to help adoption, it’s going to get you in jail. 
Bitcoin creates permanent unalterable public record of all transactions. Not really ideal for illegal activity. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 20:01:26
Maybe a dumb question but is an authenticator "app" any better than SMS? I moved the bulk of my coins to a hardware wallet but I am wondering if someone can still get on my coinbase account and try and buy some crypto with my linked bank accounts.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:15:36
I kind of want one just to have it.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:38:00
Did you try and put it on your debit card? Haha
I tried to put a $1500 or so car repair on my debit once and the bank kept denying it. Turns out there was a max transaction limit I had no idea about. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:11:17
Right. Even if 1 bitcoin = a million dollars he is still going to have more money then me.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:27:18
I started buying some silver when my 1st son was born. One of the US mint sets has more than doubled in value since then. The regular coins not so much. I actually bought some more for all my nieces and nephews for Xmas in addition to some silly toys. 
But yeah if you go to the precious metals places they all talk about the same stuff, dollar collapse, evil fed, mad max doom and gloom. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:30:47
For real though I am seriously thinking of picking up some farmland...
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:06:51
So we can ALL get rich!
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:50:18
I wrote a check today. 99% of my invoices are paid by check. For small daily transactions sure they are dumb. But in the USA large business transactions are still mostly done with checks. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:35:50
xmas bonus coming soon... do I buy a whole bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:28:26
Yes but I'm not sure I get what you are implying. Bank can mean many things, I was using it as "a store of something for later use".
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:26:21
My parents were poor and had six kids... it was more about surviving than investing. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:49:29
I never understood how they were able to withstand the crushing gravity that would cause that kind of time dilation. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:16:30
Raising interest rates is supposed to slow inflation. You would think most on this sub would cheer the move. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:08:12
I’m strangely calm. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:10:49
Take a deep breath, everything is going to be fine. Yes save some money for a rainy day and diversify, but the whole world is not going to end any time soon. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:14:02
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:53:54
Their religion just about demanded it. But sure, I’ll go back in time and tell them not to have so many kids and buy apple stocks! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:01:07
FOMO kickin in! buy buy buy
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:11:11
The majority of people don’t have $500 in savings.
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:29:04
Yeah seems like someone is getting scammed. But who?
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:54:32
Cause I don’t want tether. I want bitcoin. 
Oh apparently they have a new ICO coming soon too, sounds totally legit. Send them all your monies, you can make 330 tethers.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:17:46
Thinking about buying another bitcoin for $7k actually. It’s either that or pay off my car.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:05:40
I think of it as MY bank account. So I guess freedom? 
Really who doesn’t want to be free? 
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:11:36
Makes sense. I guess it all comes back to not leaving coins on an exchange unless you are buying/selling.
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:42:02
Yep. They live in one of my sisters houses (she married a rich dude). 
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:28:18
I don't think you understand what leveraged means. Going around trying to impress poor people is a good way to get robbed.
All the people I know that subscribe to this nonsense are deep in debt.
