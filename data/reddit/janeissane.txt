Us? You mean bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:30:40
Don't mention it.

You would have had all if the King of England only existed. Next time pick the Queen.

That would have been the appropriate reaction to "not reddit; didn't read". 
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:25:12
...and because most people are not yet educated enough about bitcoin there will be quite a few who think that "under the mattress" will be the literally so.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:43:44
that's funny, because both seem to be controlled demolition

"delusional" or "fools" for my part, retarded is not a good choice, you are wrong.

You mean those kind of posts are blocked?
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:23:12
not for me, i read that remark without any hint of sarcasm.

I wonder if it tickles if you coco my bobo, so could you? :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:10:53
So much for the warm welcome. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:23:08
Thank you! It surely tickles!
@_date: 2014-01-08 10:30:47
They were celebrating 1000. You are predicting 200. 
And dropping to 940 is not really a sign that it's a bubble after all, is it?
btw I think also that prices will fall a lot, but bottom at 500. Still doesn't mean a bubble to me.

One of the most simple explanations that I didn't get.

17 BTC already, Satoshi Nakomoto will be rich :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:12:07
i couln't agree more. let bitcoin be just a bit more like the dollar.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:31:29
glad we have satoshis, so we can divide infinity by 100000000.

it's now! go watch
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:59:25
That's getting quite personal, strangely enough on the day we want to prevent getting personal in the bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:47:29
Friends of friends have talked about hearing it happening. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:02:21
Indeed maybe not so relevant :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:49:19
hum, I think he just did that.

Hello Zoidbergcoin, welcome to Bitcoin Anonymous!

Yes, like the opposite of the butterfly effect: lots of movement on the spot with the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:40:40
This should be a sticky on the frontpage :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:57:27
Nice relevant article underneath.

I assume the market determines the price, but I could be wrong, don't shoot me.

How the fuck do people think bitcoin is dead? Hypocrits. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:59:51
they rent basic holes. you need to use your fingers to get the squeezy effect. good enough?

Yes and why is "shorter" longer than "longer"? Makes no sense...
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:32:34
bitcoin and a few other alts. lol.
@_date: 2014-11-13 07:48:59
I must say they are really funny. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:21:13
Indeed. I would only trust them by karma or so. I trust blockchain.info, but in theory they could store my private keys somewhere and run off to Hawaii at the right moment.

How much you will like your new Android phone, it will always be a disappointment compared with the iPhone. I promise you.

and it's solved.

Sorry I am not that strong. I'd die having to move to Windows. And Linux feels like I am back to the 90S having to nerd myself around the system, even with Ubuntu.

I was referring to the fact that you see bitcoin as an alt-coin compared to doge.

I'm sorry, but fake news is about hillary clinton involved in a child porn ring. You can't compare a (obviously wrong) analysis about bitcoin with fake news. Fake news got Trump elected so being sarcastic about that makes me think you are a Trump voter. Sorry bout that. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:22:45
Such a wrong and out of context reply, amazing, comparing wrong predictions with fake news. Just get over the fact that you voted wrong and live on...
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:58:28
Problem is, you cannot find bitcoins so there goes the analogy. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:52:35
