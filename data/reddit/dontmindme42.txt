Not everything. They had nice rise in value of their &gt;100k BTC stash.

When adding new account, I always save the code (or qr image) to my password manager. That way I always have the option to restore it later.

Soft blocks are very small, 1kb for a 1mb block.

SSDs arent that durable. I managed to destroy 3 SSDs in last 5 years. First had a weird defect, was using 20 times more write cycles per data written, wore off after two years. The second had a firmware issue and was bricked after 2 weeks of usage. The last one had a checksum issue after 2 years of normal usage. It had 100% health the day before.

Came here to say this

Imagine having a 1 BTC payment channel with provider A. You can instantly create and receive payments as long as the capital is not exhausted. Pay 0.1 BTC, pay 0.7 BTC, receive 0.9 BTC, pay 1 BTC,... if income and expenses are balanced, you could theoretically have it open indefinitely, i think.
Your friend has a payment channel with provider B. If provider A and B have payment channels between each other or between a common provider C, you can pay and receive from your friend. 
The money you have in the channel cannot be taken away from you, unless you're negligent and don't properly close the channel (once per month or quarter). There is no trust involved, so no need to settle to blockchain every day.

I'm almost certain you won't find the wallet file there. You have two options: replace the screen, partly pay with bitcoins and you have a working phone. Second: store the phone in a drawer, until bitcoins are (hopefully) worth more than the screen replacement.
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:35:57
Probably not 
@_date: 2016-03-07 09:09:47
I think its the opposite, if the phone was bricked, chances would be way smaller. Now he "only" has to replace the screen, which costs about $100-$150. Data recovery specialists wouldn't move a finger below $1000 and even then its a big if, whether they would be able to get the private keys.

No, they are independent. First one is for payment volume (instant, micro transactions), second is for adding new features, that are not available in mainchain.

SegWit has many improvements, not just more tx capacity. No need to be bitter about it...

For a smart-contract user, its probably no advantage. For an investor, its big difference, since he can gain or lose capital depending on which coin prevails. For more on the phenomenon, google "Bitcoin maximalism."

Comparing hashrate of 2*sha256 to ethash is like comparing number of blueberries to melons.

If I remember correctly, very soon after Satoshi put him in charge. Gavin didn't want to be the only one with commit access. He was lead maintainer though, until he gave the position to Wladimir in 2014.

You're technically correct, but split will not happen, if miners don't decide for XT with at least 75% majority. So in practice there will be no doubt, which one is the real one.

isn't 5 mil punisment enough?

First, there are not that many bitcoin holders willing to spend their bitcoins (I'm not saying they should). Second, the more merchants, the less bitcoin traffic each one gets. We were onboarding lots of merchants in 2014, but lately not so much, because the existing ones don't have much sales and integration is barely worth the hassle.

You give control to two separate parties. If both are criminal or compromised, you lose the funds.

I edited my reply, thought maybe the second part wasn't clear enough.
And thanks to the team, for pushing things forward and making stuff happen!

I don't like this. Unnecessarily complicated and confusing for non-technical people. Why not just use multisig?

DNS query by Core only "leaks" node IP address, I think SamuraiWallet leaks all wallet addresses combined with IP address, which, if true, is much worse, but not end of the world. Its practically the same as using blockchain.info wallet directly.

I was in the big blocks camp not long ago (now more neutral), while absolutely supporting the privacy enhancing features. I think the "hate" was more of a frustration, the cause for which was blocksize policy, not confidentiality.

IMO it is very useful for arbitrage between exchanges. 
Its maybe useful as a compromise between having money on exchange (riskier) vs having it on computer (safer). I contemplated using it for small part of my funds to let me react quickly (trading), but decided against it. It offers no special advantage to having some money on exchange, since the exchange is already using BitGo as a protection, so there is probably no risk disadvantage of leaving on exchange vs having in BitGo Instant wallet.

John Cleese Explains bitcoins:
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:30:49
Bitcoin deposits are cleared faster than fiat; I think undersupply of fiat pushes price a bit lower in the beginning. If you check the fees instead of price, they both have 0.25% fee for market orders. But Coinbase waives the fee, if you create limit order and somebody else takes it.

Do you perhaps have space at the end? This often happens with copy-paste...
