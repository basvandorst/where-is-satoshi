This means ASIC for memory heavy hash cryptocurrency. No altcoin is safe from ASIC when this tech arrives.

About the same chance that all the particles in your body quantum tunneling ..."to the moon"

That is vulnerable to collision attack. Given how large the blockchain is. You write a message, hash it, search blockchain with given hash if none found modify the message. Repeat process until hash collision is achieve

This is ridiculous. If you want to expose and investigate you don't f***ing sign an NDA. Non Disclosure Agreement is the exact opposite of what you want. The only way to win is not to play the game.

nope mining is use to prevent double spending. with out proof of work anyone can tamper history and spend their coins multiple times.

a simple script to transfer tainted bitcoin to all the address in the blockchain will blacklist all address immediately. rendering blacklisting effort useless

1. sha 256 is quantum resistant
2. unspent address is quantum resistant
3. it is very easy to make the entire bitcoin protocol to be quantum resistant
4. quantum computer is not magic

why can't you use proof of work to slow down the request? This way the attacker have to scale up 10x or 100x before it affects your server.

no grover`s algorithm only offer quadratic speed up to brute force. this means that 160 bit hash against QC is as resistant to 80 bit hash against classical computers.
quantum computer is not magic.

I thought you need greater hashing power of the current network (100+%) in order to do 51% attack. If your hashing power is only half of the current network hashing power then when you add your own. It will only amount to 33% of the combine hashing power
