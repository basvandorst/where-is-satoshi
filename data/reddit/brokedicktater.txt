I guess in Venezuela there is so much wealth and value being created they just can't print enough to keep up right?

Just like the turkey who makes predictions a week before Thanksgiving. So are you. You have no special information, and if you did you wouldn't post it here. Your "intuition" doesn't mean shit. And your predictions don't mean shit.

Not trying to be rude but you are giving advice and I'm calling you out on having zero credibility. These are YOUR statements, not mine. If you want to come to a public forum and make all sorts of stupid claims then be prepared to back them up. FRAUD.
-it is still not a good time to buy,
-Once it hits $8K, you can buy if you want to
-$8K its just gonna stagnate there for some time (at least until well into 2020).
-Personally, my intuition has been incredibly accurate
-So you all might want to consider listening to me this time.

Let's hope he lives long enough to see his predictions come true.

Hold on now, don't you think this a little extreme? Can't USD and BTC co-exist? And if this actually happens as you are suggesting then instead of buying BTC you should be buying dry food and automatic weapons right?

Couldn't agree more. This guy is a dickhead who has already profited from looting and pillaging after crashes to amass a net worth of over $300 million. The same crash the asshole is setting us up for again. FUCK HIM

I would never argue your scenario is an impossibility to play out. I guess I'm not as pessimistic, but yes it could happen. I would hope BTC will force governments to responsibility manage their currencies or see their currency go extinct. There is a new sheriff and if you fuck your currency you die. I'm ok with this.

A prediction is wrong only if it costs you something.
A prediction is right only if it makes you something.
The rest is tawk. -NNT
and that's all this is. TAWK

The banks already check the "legality" of basically every dollar you run through there. Suspicious activity reports, cash transaction reports, you name it. So I'm not sure how this would apply to them?

Isn't precious metal mining wasting resources also? The price of gold has little to do with it's "jewelry" value or industrial uses.

It's great advice but unbelievably he wasn't conservative enough. He suggests no more than 50% loan to value. I was in banking during 2008 and at 50% LTV you still got your ass handed to you because prices went down 80%.
 
My post 2008 advice would be "lend only 25% or less valuation."

Not that it's a big deal but you're not technically correct. Visa makes money on processing the payments. The credit balances and and interest are paid to and offered by banks, like Capital One, Chase, Wells, or whatever bank it is. They are the ones who don't want people paying off their balances. Visa doesn't give a shit about your credit, they just want you to use the card to buy everything.

We are all used to seeing the dips. In fact, I have dip fatigue. However, one of these times it's not dipping.

Yes they do, and stores that have high volume and low margins pay even more. Think about if you are a grocery store with 5% margins and credit cards eat up 3/5ths of your margin for each transaction. There is so much money sloshing around in the credit card transaction business it's sickening and Bitcoin could put them all out of business. Let's hope we see it happen.

Can people just buy it and leave it in their accounts? This is starting to sound like Facebook Bank only they don't pay interest. I suppose it's insured with cash though correct? . What am I missing here?

get out of here with your well reasoned response. To the moon or nothing and right now!!

More buyers than sellers.

It might be possible they (the whales)  had stop-loss orders in and once the market went down they all got triggered, further accelerating the decline, further triggering lower stop losses etc. Not that I know anything, I'm not a whale.

It depends. Some days there are more buyers than sellers, some days there are more sellers than buyers. No one ever knows who is showing up for the daily auction and anyone who says they know is probably full of shit or at a minimum if they did know they wouldn't tell us.
