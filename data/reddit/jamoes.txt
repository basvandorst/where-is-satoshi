I think this is an interesting experiment, because it will reveal which type of currency free people actually use when given the choice. A common critique of bitcoin is that it has a fixed supply, which Keyensians claim is untenable for a currency. I would argue that if given the choice between a currency that holds its value vs a currency which degrades in value over time, no rational actor would choose the latter.
So, the success or failure of Freicoin will provide a very good answer to the question of whether a currency should be inflationary.

This is awesome! I love it when you can buy real-world goods with bitcoins. I will probably make a purchase here when I start to run low of my existing supply of coffee.
I was clicking around, and I have a little bit of constructive feedback:
 * The prices seem a little bit high. Usually I expect to pay 10-15 USD for a pound of coffee, whereas you're charging 1.69 BTC for 12 oz. This works out to about $25/lb. I would be much more inclined to purchase here if there wasn't such a premium.
 * The shopping cart UI overflows to the right of the main page block. See screenshot: 
 * In general, I think the page design could be cleaned up a little bit. I don't have a ton of specific tips here, because I'm no designer, but the design just feels a little off to me.
 * You say your site is hosted by Quicksilver Spider, but it doesn't look like that company accepts bitcoin as payment. I say you should switch to a hosting provider that does accept BTC - help out the overall bitcoin economy!
I hope that wasn't too critical, I'm just trying to give you some constructive feedback so you can make your site even better :)
Overall, great work!

It's funny the hoops statists jump through in order to justify counterfeiting. The fact is, an inflationary currency simply can't exist without artificially increasing the money supply.

I implemented the polynomial solution you described for my cryptography course in undergrad. 
Check it out here: 
It all still works, I just tested it out. I would definitely just take this as a reference implementation though - don't actually use it to encrypt important things. It hasn't been through any peer review other than that it earned me an A.

Yes, I am absolutely saying that. I was thinking more of NTFS, but the point is the exact same. I would never want large quantities of my money dependent on a proprietary file system, no matter how widespread that filesystem is. Why add the extra dependency?
Also, SHA256 isn't an encryption method, it's a hashing method. Maybe you're thinking of AES? Hey cool, now you've said the dumbest thing *I've* read today!

I can assure you that if you post a well-written post describing flexcoin and prove that you own it (maybe put a comment in the html), and offer to answer all questions - you will be well received. Reddit is much more community focused than Digg, therefore there has a much higher signal-to-noise ratio. If you post something valuable to the bitcoin subreddit, it will be noticed.
I for one am extremely interested in the entrepreneurship that is going on around bitcoin. I think ideas like this (a bank which makes it extremely easy for users to hold and spend bitcoins, without having to deal with installing software and securing their wallet) are absolutely critical to the success of bitcoin, and therefore I love to read about and discuss them.

I would not recommend using truecrypt to back up wallet.dat, since it requires an entire file system to be encrypted. if you are recovering your wallet years later, it may be difficult to recover, since filesystems have changed. It's also unnecessary overhead.
You can use the following command, which will create a single encrypted file:
`openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in wallet.dat -out wallet.dat.aes-256-cbc`
Alternatively, take a look at this bash script: 
That script will create a zip file which contains instructions of how to decrypt the wallet.
That's not to say it's a bad idea to keep your wallet on an encrypted truecrypt drive for day-to-day use. I just wouldn't use it for long term backup storage.

Not necessarily. Please remember that there are those that fight for entropy. If technological development halts (due to e.g. thermo-nuclear armageddon), then humanity will never see the singularity.
This is why your action is important.

The checksums are PGP signatures. An attacker would not likely be able to place *valid* checksums up there.

Do you need a money transmitter license to buy and sell gold? If not, then I can't understand why you'd need one for bitcoin. If so, then they probably already have one in Alaska, and they're safe anyway.
I can't wait to see more pawn shops doing this!

This is the best response to the "somolia" argument ever.

Nope. The SEC has created a protection racket where only the rich can legally invest in the most profitable areas.
You want to invest in a pre-IPO startup? Too bad. Unless you're an "accredited investor" (read: already rich) you legally cannot.

Definitely agree about making a random unique password for every site.
I'm a fan of  It's an HTML5 password manager that utilizes in-browser crypto (a-la blockchain.info) to encrypt all your secrets client-side. They've got a nice android and iOS app as well, so it's easy to share my passwords across all my devices.

Why doesn't it inspire trust? I know the author personally, so that's why I trust it. But, I'd love to hear what he can improve to gain more trust for new users.
Also, on the iPhone, I'd recommend the app, since it supports 1-click copying, and a better overall UX:

All your questions are good, but I'd especially like to see Jon answer this one.
