That sounds horrible.  My friend has been trying to get verified on CB since the middle of DEC.

What makes bitcoin superior to the alts other than name recognition? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:25:32
It's my understanding that once you close the channel there is no record of the transactions that took place inside.  I suppose it's on either party to keep records if they wish (or are regulated to).

Bucket of chicken: $19.99 + $20 transaction fee :-/

That's still not what gives it value

Use gdax to withdrawal

I like dogecoins

Thanks for clarifying!

lol, great work around!

Can't use it as a currency due to volatility and capital gains :-\.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:23:41
That makes sense, thanks.

Would the transaction history on the lightening network still be accessible after closing a channel?

@_date: 2017-08-24 22:31:54
Ah ok, that makes sense.  Thank you!

Thanks for clarifying.  This might be a don't question, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around LN.  What is the purpose of the time lock?

Who would resolve a dispute over the escrow funds?

The price is going to have to stabilize before any crypto can be used successfully as currency.  That's good and bad.  Allot of people right now are only interested in btc to get those massive gains from the price spikes.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:18:27
The price needs to be relatively stable before (I think) bitcoin will be useful as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:45:24
That assumes that think this is going down to 0.  If whales are the ones driving the price down then it doesn't seem smart for them to sell at this level when they could had at 10k+.

Why cash out now though and not when it was up?
