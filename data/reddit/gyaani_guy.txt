That makes sense. Inflation @ 2% suggests consumers have 2% more money supply. But as increased money supply is not distributed spread evenly, who gets the lions share ? Where does it go ?
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:09:54
Q. Compared  US money supply with inflation,  got the same result as OP.
idk, but sounds like there has to be something 'standardish' that affects inflation other than 'increase in money supply'.. Maybe because production has also been increasing ? more supply, cheaper products, less inflation ??

I can relate, and offer a humble suggestion. 
Stop believing, at least consciously. 
Ignore the subreddit drama and *Start fact checking*    
Easier said than done though..

WTF ? You are comparing a decentralized p2p currency  to a section on an internet forum ?

From official response


The problem jxbrowser is not a user 'plugin' . It comes with coinomi by default. So basically they were using code that they weren't checking.

Yes the OP may not know how it works, but It will be helpful if someone actually   answers the question instead of just sarcastic remarks.

No I haven't read it, why don't you enlighten us how it works, instead of just repeating invest in mining equipment. 


NYA is practically one.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:11:02
of course, but 78% are aware, which is nowhere near zero :p
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:17:53
*if* I knew these answers, I would have answered them instead of asking others to.   
Your childish rants and preconceived notions are probably why no one is responding with a direct answer. Enjoy!

Since the OP didn't in the original post.


 **We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin.**  
We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability.

 - track and optional notifications of BTC to USD  on website / push notifications / messengers / email   
1. Most of these options will ensure your wife wakes up.  
2. Show her the Coins   
3. Blowjob!
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:07:49
I have a similar tool that works on messenger, Telegram and Skype and email and push notifications.

Unfortunately there are very few technical discussions here, So +1  
I would highly recommended @_date: 2017-10-20 14:52:51
No, because it's completely separate  from Bitcoin.   
Alternative coins (altcoin) such as 'Bcash' commonly named as 'bitcoin cash' , can be created by anyone quite easily. and named pretty much anything to create confusion.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:58:47


Nonsense. It's the users who have worked for months and bought or got paid in bitcoin who have the biggest stake. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:53:07
You don't get the point of bitcoin AT ALL ! It's a fucking decentralized currency. No one can just buy lots of equipment , join a cartel and decide.

Actually a recent survey says :

'need' ?? what the scene needs are people who are good at what they do. It should be completely irrelevant whether those people are women/men/other etc.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:09:15
Indeed that's how it is. I wonder how the instructions could be modified to make it clearer.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:41:36
There was an issue with the service from where I was getting prices ( . Switched since then , should be fine now.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:24:16


like as an extension ? and/or an background tab that informs of changes ?
Both are feasible and are great ideas! 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:21:07


Yup. But the base price also changes whenever the percentage is set. Base price == the price from which change % is calculated.  
Not sure if I understand the time-window part though .  
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:19:12
Most Welcome  
1. SMS : Would think about this, since sending texts won't be free. Instead I think the push notifications should work equally well ?
2. This can be done!  But will have to wait..
3. I like this a lot. added to the todo list!
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:08:09
I am super glad that people are liking it. 
**Open to feature requests!**
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:30:22
that's nice. Will definitely incorporate it in my site :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:53:14
Welcome dude! tx fees/byte may well have to wait, depends on how the site does, time, API  etc..
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:48:52
Hey much thanks for the explanation, but my brain for some strange reason isn't working at required capacity. So..
Anyways if there is a fast price change, then the bot sort of notifies this by sending more notifications. I know, not similar but that's what it does now.   
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:40:05


I am not sure, but blockchain (NOT bitcoin) for whatever technical reasons are there, are being explored by lot of different industries for various purposes. This includes financial institutions. A simple google search would show this.
