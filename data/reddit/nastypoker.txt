Anyone can edit code. Bitcoin is open source.  What gives the network strength against anything malicious is that every miner and node gets to choose which version of the software to run. It is like voting by picking software. Miners make money by processing transactions and so it is in their interest to maintain network integrity by only running software which is "good". 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:58:55


Yes, theoretically. If you believe in bitcoin as a technology, theoretically the value is going to go up. Whether it will or not, remains to be seen. There are more factors at play. Regulation, hacks, market manipulation etc.

You make an awful lot of assumptions in that post. You define succes at the beginning but then ignore that it is a real possibility that the miners could choose to leave the existing chain if it becomes less profitable. If there was massive support for a new chain, what stops the old one from dying out? Profit? Short term maybe but long term? 
It is interesting looking at ETC/ETH but that is a bit different since support is split between both. If the decision was more black and white, one coin could definitely stop functioning.

There is zero chance people are going to invest in BFX coin. The absolute maximum value is that which Bitfinex is placing on it. I imagine a lot of people will trade it for a fraction of the BTC or whatever they lost.

@_date: 2016-08-24 10:45:57
It depends how your bitcoin is stored. If it is currently in a single address then he would be able to see the total amount. If you are using a HD wallet with lots of inputs and addresses, it depends how much is in each address. I would send the 0.17 to a fresh address, wait a couple of days, then send to another fresh address then send to your uncle. He would have no way of knowing for sure how much BTC up the trail is yours this way.

The failure is a company with less than sufficient security protocols. Not with the crypto community. 


By offering charity to those affected by hacks? How about we let the problem solve itself. Companies will see the shitstorm that happens after they get hacked and are thus more likely to improve security. Customers will demand better security as well. 


I don't see this as a problem. These sorts of hacks do not affect enough people to have any sort of significant effect. Anyone that knows how cryptocurrency works knows that this is not an issue with the currency, but with companies holding large amounts being targets for hackers. 
I am sorry you lost money but no one with any significant amount is going to invest/donate it to your cause. Why would they? The possibility of profiting is so low. Look at Bter which got hacked, where are they now? Who is going to stay on an exchange that takes 36% of all users funds when they get hacked? The value of BFX on the open market will be between 0% and 10% of the value Bitfinex put on it.

That information is totally useless unless you know the owner of the address.

There are loads and loads of other coins. Thousands. You can make your own very easily and start mining it. The difference between those and bitcoin is the network effect.

Monero because it is not just a copycat clone like many other alts. It is fully anonymous which I think will be the reason it will succeed. 
Ethereum is interesting but I do not see why it should be used as a currency and as such, is not in competition with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is outdated in a technical point of view compared to some alts.

The past is not always a predictor of what happens in the future. 
Ultimately, by using a wallet made by someone else, you are trusting not only the wallet creator but also the device to not steal from you. By using a hardware wallet, you are are reducing that risk to just the manufacturer and even then, you can do checks yourself to ensure the device is truly secure.

of course, but do you check each version you download or update to? 99% of people blindly trust updates to their wallets and you never know if the code is changed slightly to funnel all your funds way at some point until it has been checked and verified by someone who knows what they are doing. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:04:35
It doesn't work like that. Fees follow real world costs, the price of BTC is irrelevant. 
Example, BTC goes to $50k each, fees are high so lots of people start mining and the difficulty rises until it is only just profitable based on current hardware and we have a kind of equilibrium.

The value of digital currencies is based on their perceived value to society/business. 
Most offer nothing new or look like pre-mine scams. Some are very interesting but asking this on is likely to get a lot of hate because people seem to like one over all others.
Personally, I follow Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero although I would not invest in Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 04:02:28
I guess I don't see the value in the actual Ether. If someone wants to transfer value, we should use Bitcoin or Monero which are dedicated stores of value. Relatively simple in comparison to Ethereum. 
Also, PoS has not been tested properly yet and makes me worried for the short term future of Ethereum. I still follow progress but I am not investing any money right now. Too risky.

All I am saying is that Bitcoin in it's current form is not technologically advanced enough for that. Whether it is fees, tx times or many other issues. 
The good news is that there are other digital currencies working on these problems as well as bitcoin devs so hopefully we end up with something that can be used in every day tx's.

Like you say, the system is automated. It probably has a set length of time before it raises limits and it probably won't be less than 8 weeks. I can imagine is going up every 3 months or something. I am pretty sure the whole reason they limit people is for AML/KYC laws so it probably isn't even their choice completely.

@_date: 2016-11-09 08:19:16
Huh? You can't "login" to a private address. A public and private address are just keys. If you send BTC to the public address, you can then spend them using the private address. 
With paper wallets, do not use more than once. Also, learn about change addresses. You need to send all BTC off at once ideally.

You have to press 2 fairly stiff buttons at once 5 times before your wallet will open. Then all the confirming of transactions is done with 1 button. The buttons are quite close together so it may be possible but it really isn't designed to be operated 1 handed unfortunately. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 08:09:15
TX times: You are talking like you think bitcoin will replace credit/debit card transactions which I do not. Some people say the lightning network will help but I still think there will be a need for conventional centralised platforms as well. 
1. No, the core devs offer options and the decision is made by miners. That is the fundamental basis of how the bitcoin protocol works. 
2. Once again, I don't think bitcoin will necessarily work for micro transactions or quick store type transactions. 
Mainstream adoption does not mean it is used for everything. You don't use gold for buying a chocolate bar do you.

Not sure on specific locations but the actual prices are from exchanges and then places like google will usually compile information from different locations to give an average.

Unlikely. 
Exchanges have been hacked many times and people don't usually get anything back. If you leave coins on exchanges, you are not in full control of them.

Are you disagreeing? From what I understand, the core devs will develop and issue an update and it is up to each miner to decide whether or not to implement the change. This is how forks happen, when there is a split decision so we end up with 2 or more chains.

Bitcoin is no longer decentralised and is in the hands of a few powerful miners. The idea is great but the execution of bitcoin seems to have failed. 
We cannot go forward relying on kind-hearted miners or whatever to keep the protocol alive, it has to work by design and in its current state, it does not.

They need to monitor it all the time e.g. have an internet connection to actually validate the transaction for the very reason you just said. If by "complete transaction" you mean hope the other party is honest then yes you don't need the internet but that is of no use to anyone.

Where is the private key exactly?
EDIT: A tip for you, if you sold these with shear screws it would be good. That was people can put their own key inside and then the bolt head shears off completely. Saves having to drill a screw head which might not look good if they don't have a pillar drill and they don't have to trust you with even their encrypted key.

@_date: 2016-09-29 10:38:00
1. With your first tx with Circle, a security check is common and happens to everyone I believe. After that, all future tx's are instant. 
2. The value going down is because you have your balance stored in BTC and you are seeing the conversion rate so as the price of bitcoin falls, so does your balance. You still have the same amount of BTC you bought though. You can also go into settings and choose to keep your balance in $ if you want. 
3. These posts are quite common and they are all new users to Circle. The fact is Circle is the quickest, easiest and for me, the cheapest method to obtain BTC but they have to abide by government rules covering AML/KYC stuff as they deal with fiat currency and your debit/credit card. The only alternatives are p2p exchanges which are great but still not as quick and easy as centralised exchanges like Circle. 
4. Relax, your money is fine. Contact Circle directly if you have any more queries.

All you need to know about BTC-E is that it is a fairly dodgy site based in Russia with slow support BUT they have been around for ages and you are unlikely to have any major problems. I would guess they are not regulated properly so there is more risk with them than a western based exchange. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 08:33:17
No idea but I would guess of all the governments in the world, the US would have the biggest effect. That was just one example, it could be anything. There could be a flaw found in the technology or there may be a competitor that is a lot better and BTC just loses value over time. Either way, with any sort of savings or investment, if you pick riskier things, then diversifying is not bad advice.

No sorry. I believe it is fairly close to the limit now with 85 million Ether and that there are no immediate plans to increase the limit although as with any crypto currency, if the majority of mining power agrees that there should be more, they can make it so.

From what I understand, Ethereum is planning to switch to PoS rather than a PoW mining system next year. The 5ETH reward per block will then stop and we will have ended up with around 100 million Ether. This is course relies on the Ethereum network upgrading to PoS but this seems likely as it has been planned for a while and is spearheaded by VB himself. 
I am not that knowledgeable on the subject so hopefully someone can come along to explain further. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 06:31:20
I suppose the farm could split into different pools. The risk would still be there. Hell, this might be going on right now. Fairly large flaw in PoW mining. 
I can't remember the names of the pools but there was a time when a pool was getting very large, ~40% IIRC and they announced that they wouldn't go any higher because it would affect peoples confidence in Bitcoin and the benefit of earning more BTC would be offset by the drop in value.

There are many ideas out there about what Bitcoin is for. We don't really know how it will affect the current financial system but what we do know are the hard coded facts.

If you have 10btc in a wallet, from multiple sources you do not want knowing where your funds are spent. Surely sending the whole amount to one address and then another removes any trace of ownership. From then on, nobody knows who owns the coins except the owner. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 03:49:54
Yeah, once one transaction has been made, they have zero proof of who owns the coins so tracking is pointless.

As has been said above, there are no metrics to base trades on short term. It is pure gamble unless you know someone is about to pump or dump. 
Buying and hodling is the most profitable strategy if you believe the value will go up over time. Short term it can do anything at the will of whales.

Well don't use them then. There are alternatives but I don't think anything nefarious is going on. They are just covering themselves in case they get approached by some government agency...or maybe they already have been and that is why. Either way, move coins to a private wallet first. This ensures privacy.

On average 0-0.5% premium. You might find the odd person willing to pay over the odds for a fresh coin but there are not going to be many people. Unless it was mined in 2010 or one of those first edition Casasasaasassaicias coins, then I doubt you will get away with charging a premium. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 04:44:50


OK That makes sense. 


I disagree there. Once coins move from a known address to an unknown address, there is no proof of anything. They could have been sent to another person or company and you would have no idea. Sure you could base a hunch off something like that which may help but it is circumstantial. 
Lets say I receive 1btc from 10 people into one address. What would be the simplest way to "clean" these coins of my identity without giving control of the coins to a third party mixing service.

How would someone know that you own a particular address unless you send coins directly from a company that has your details like an exchange, to a "dodgy" address?

This is the biggest flaw with Circle. It is a great app/company but they don't make it obvious how it works and until you get your head around it, it can be confusing. 
The key is in settings, set your wallet to be GBP or BTC. I leave mine GBP then anything I deposit is just kept in £ and I just withdraw to BTC whenever I want.

Yes but by doing one middle step transaction combining all inputs to one output and then doing one extra tx, does this not cover tracks so to speak? I may have misunderstood how this works so this is a genuine question.

No, not at all. I imagine anyone even remotely involved in bitcoin could have a very nasty case made against them very easily by any competent lawyer. In a large public case though, you may be able to argue circumstantial, so long as they don't have any actual evidence to go with it.

If they have plenty of positive ratings you are probably OK. Localbitcoins rating system is pretty good and most sellers put that clause in there to protect themselves from hassle. I used to sell a little bit a while ago and the amount of timewasters and people who didn't know what they were doing drove me up the wall. Do not start a transaction unless you have the ability to make a payment straight away and you should have no issues with a reputable seller. 
I used to always use local or bitbargain but I just use Circle now. Easy, instant and I am not doing anything criminal so I don't mind a company knowing who I am. Can't remember what ID I used but I would try Circle before doing anything else. Their exchange rate is pretty good as well. Better than LBC a lot of the time. Current £504, vs LBC @ £512

Seems like a good way to lose business. If they go into a checkout system expecting to pay by card/Paypal and are presented with a long and convoluted payment method that involves them still using their card and potentially ID, then they are not gonna pick it and it might confuse them enough to look elsewhere for whatever product you are selling.

If your wallet is in GBP, it will stay at the amount you deposit in GBP. 
I should also point out, I never keep any funds on any exchange, even Circle. I just deposit and withdraw BTC to my own wallet. Leaving funds on an exchange is an extra layer of risk I don't want and is only worth doing if you are planning on trading for short term profit. If you are, Circle is not the best place to do that.

You have to realise that they are a company operating in the US dealing with Fiat currency. They are subject to AML and KYC rules and regulations which suck, but they are legal requirements and they don't really have a choice unless they want to risk getting investigated/fined/shut down.

If you dumped 60% of an exchanges daily trade volume in one go, that would in of itself cause that exchange to crash. It would be a stupid thing to do since you would lose massive value. 
If you have a large stash of coins, you simply cannot unload them all at once without affecting the market. Saying that, the larger exchanges can handle a lot more than they could a year ago.

The answer you are looking for is no. The amount of BTC you will generate will be worth far far far less than the cost of the electricity you use to generate it. You might generate a few cents worth over weeks and weeks. Better off just buying a tiny amount to have a play with.

Yes. Electrum and others are open source and the server verification is monitored by anyone that wants to. 


Not sure what you mean. Do you mean anonymity? I mean they will only protect you as much as you take care of your own privacy. Your keys with electrum will always be on your PC. 


Electrum uses BIP39 so you will generate a 12 or 24 word seed when you first start up. You can use this at anytime to restore your entire wallet with ANY compatible wallet of which there are many. This is like the ultimate back up so keep this seed safe. 


Technically, running core is the best way to go BUT the benefit is miniscule and really not worth storing the entire blockchain for. 
One other point, if you have any significant amount of coins, a hardware wallet is the way to go. Look up Trezor/Ledger wallet/Keepkey for options. These are generally considered the most secure methods to keep coins but also be able to use them quickly and easily.

The exchanges are already being regulated and that level of regulation will only increase. If bitcoin becomes a day to day use currency e.g. people paid and pay for things btc to btc without the fiat currency at either end then it becomes much harder BUT the liability will most likely lie with the business rather than the consumer. Businesses accepting or paying out BTC will be required to record everything meaning tax could still be paid but people could theoretically still hide money. Just like they do now with cash rather than banks/cards. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:02:11
FYI Barclays are known to have shut down accounts related to bitcoin trading. I haven't heard of anyone having their account shut down just for sending money to an exchange though. It is most likely a standard fraud check. Unusual activity flags up on their system. It is actually pretty good and I had my card cloned a while back and they sorted it all out in about 20 minutes. I have also had ~£50k go through my account for BTC in the past year with no issues so I would say don't worry just yet.

The reason the exchange rate is lower is because it will cost you more to get your fiat into your btc-e account.

who rewards the miners for mining since there is no central authority?
It is written into the bitcoin protocol that all miners use. 


They receive a block reward for each block they process. The "work" they do verifies the transactions which in turn completes the blocks. 


Total maximum is ~21 million BTC. Currently about 15.75 million have been mined. This is a controlled increase and the final BTC will not be mined for many many years as the block reward halves every 4 years.

No charges but the sellers may charge a little more for the service. I know when I used to sell on bitbargain that people have btc within 10 minutes 95% of the time.

Well Gox still has a large market share of the exchanges so transactions are happening all the time for gox prices. Sure it may be better value elsewhere but it doesn't change the fact people are paying gox prices.

This is true for any manufactured cards or coins. Your trust is with the company that makes them. 
Truly 100% guaranteed secure wallets are paper wallets or brain wallets. But these do not look pretty unless you own a card/coin printing machine.

Why would it not be legal? 
Any argument can be countered easily by either comparing it to cash or pointing out obvious flaws in your opponents logic. 
There is nothing illegal about Bitcoin. Who is being harmed? Is mining legal you ask! Is using any computer program legal? Of course it is.

No. 
Do you mean do the authorities have some sort of line whereby if you cross it, they will want you to pay tax on any profit you make from speculating?

Police officers would not be able to use discretion in a case like this. This is a potential money laundering charge, not a traffic stop.

I meant in terms of useful work done, it doesn't require much. I did a little bit back in April but it was a lot of hassle and I stopped after I worked out how much I turned over in a month. I really didn't want the hassle of being investigated for ML or something so I stopped.

As soon as any real gap appears, someone will come along and arbitrage it back to level. Easy way to make money. People are doing it on Gox vs. Bitstamp.

Maybe this is a naive view but I don't see Bitcoin taking over every form of payment. For a lot of things, it is great, for others   not so much. 
Instant transactions done through cash in hand will still be around. Maybe at some point in the future when the bitcoin infrastructure is already huge it could happen but the likelihood is so small in my eyes.

AML regulations, and if I was an exchange owner, I would be worried about being prosecuted for drug and money laundering type crimes since Bitcoin is associated with both. Banking in the UK is horrendous and the sooner bitcoin becomes widespread the better.

It was kind of a joke but this is just about the exchange rate right? Buy dollars, sell BTC. If you want it the other way sell dollars for BTC. Simples

If you had a wallet on your pc, you could set some sort of macro to do it for you but there is nothing built into the bitcoin network to do that.

You really think the banks and government are just going to allow continued use of bitcoin as it is? It sounds like tinfoil hat stuff but the banks will try to stop bitcoin. Even if it only takes 10% of all transactions, they are not going to just let that happen without trying to stop it. Banks and card processors that is.

Anyones predictions right now are gut feelings. 
It is good news that the exchange rate hasn't changed much BUT that is in no way an indication of long term value. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 11:58:58
Yes but Bitcoin is designed to be open and we do not put trust in governments who are supposed to be helping the public.

Or heard about it from social media. Subway recently deleted the tweet about them accepting bitcoin at a store. Presumably at the request of their card processors.

Ok, so it's kind of like hashing a password. So is the pass phrase on its own the private key? I have one of your wallet cards already and will probably order a few of these TFA ones once I understand it all. 
Thanks for answering my questions. 
EDIT: Ok I see to actually decrypt the key, I need the intermediate key (printed on the card) and my pass phrase, enter them into one of the programs you linked to and it will give me my private key.
