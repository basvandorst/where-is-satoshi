So the Cosbycoin forum got hacked, the word Cosbycoin has replaced by Bitcoin everywhere, and the pictures of Cosby are also gone. Very funny. Ha Ha
And last and worst of all, I lost all of my Cosbycoins. And they keep pretending that this is the new "normal"?
When will the Cosbycoin forums return to normal?

So that's why the forums are down...
I like the part where the word Bitcoin was replaced by CosbyCoin everywhere. Nice hack.

Some open-source projects have explicit rules for granting and revoking committer rights.
[Open vSwitch's rules]( look pretty good, perhaps Todd&amp;co should do something similar.

On BBC's part it was (and unfortunately still is) incompetence.
On Monday I thought BBC had made a mistake, but it was a bank holiday in Britain, and in my naivety I thought that was the reason why they hadn't redacted the story yet.
But today? They must really take a look at themselves and find out what went wrong.
The Economist already noticed the mistake that they have made. BBC? Hello?
And the LRB? What are they going to publish? "WE ARE FOOLS"? In caps lock? Are you? I used to think not.

For the most part I think they were just fools following Galvin (another fool). A blind leading the blind.
