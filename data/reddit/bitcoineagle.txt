Thank you for this explanation, makes sense to me now.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there 2FA only for logging into the Blockchain.info account? I really searched for "2FA for whitdrawal" also, but just couldn't find it. I would need this or the email whitdrawal confirmation also. Logging in with 2FA just isn't enough.

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

Can we still tip you to get a piece?

How safe is an android phone if it's always "offline" (wifi off and no data connection)? Also, how safe is it to store bitcoins there? Let's say you don't touch the phone for 1 year. Or 3 years. Is the data going to be fine on that flash storage? My concern is that it would die and what then? Is that a legit concern or is there nothing to worry about?

Can't there be a simpler "uTorrent/IRC/etc (ok not good examples) " like software  where people can meet, discuss, and then trade in person. A software to attract the majority. A marketplace than is a bit different than localbitcoins.

Sure, they're not adopting it. And I assume they know about it quite a big more than months ago.

From BTC-E wallet to another LTC address.

That's probably true, but let's say Unicredit does default. Will the money you have in Bitstamp be in risk? Will the paper money be in risk? (€uros) Or will the Bitcoin balance also be in risk?

SwagPoker, where are you going to bring in Omaha? (and stud, etc)

If Bernanke says it's good, there a chance there's something really bad about bitcoin.

Actually I have more than that, I bought very low and it's has already payed of in that sense. I'm not trying to get rich tomorrow and I'm willing to accept the reality - which currently is that it's not moving much. I'm on on the other side of you, but given all the good that we've heard of bitcoins, it seems that it's very isolated or something third. 1.x billion in BTCs right now, that's nothing. Think about all the people out there who could move it, yet don't. Also i'm not acting like it should go up for a few dollars every 3 days, but for that "thousands" level, it should move more. So either that is unrealistic or we should be seeing way more by now?

I don't fully understand the coloured coins concept. Does it mean we're going to have to buy new coins if we already have btcs?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:16:18
Awesome. I've been waiting for a launch from you guys.
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:17:06
Ok let's put it another way. Why doesn't it move for more than a few $ in this month? It doesn't move much. Again, there are some expectations of it going to thousands. Or even much more than that. How will that happen if it's this slow?
(i'm aware of the movements from 0 to 126$)

What do you prefer...re-investing profit from dividends into more AsicMiner shares or "cashing-out" the profit?

I'm from Slovenia but I guess we're too small to make a difference. Also, how likely is it that many adopt it? They will look for other solutions. Also, even if a large number buy it you have almost no bitcoin business here. But it's an opportunity I guess.
@_date: 2013-09-28 02:09:11
Let's say that I could colour them. Could I then uncolour them?
@_date: 2013-09-10 10:20:00
Bitstamp uses Unicredit, right? Are they in jeopardy too?
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:49:56
Ok, now we're getting somewhere. Obviously there were big bouts, but why isn't there a steady pace up? Can't we assume that more and more people know about bitcoins on a daily basis? Why isn't that reflected in the price? Isn't it true that more people know about it today than one month ago, and two months ago, etc? I would GUESS this discovery of bitcoin would propel the price steadily and consistently up, yet it seems more stuck.
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:27:36
I'm trying to be more informed as to what is happening and why. Period.
@_date: 2013-09-10 12:34:08
The first risk that I see is UniCredit potentially defaulting. AFAIK that is not on the immediate horizon (or is it?). Secondly, yes I have funds there (BTCs, not fiat), as many others do. The question is very simple, can they seize BTCs in case UniCredit goes default? Because in this case I am going to be transferring them somewhere else, even though I find Bitstamp the best solution for me out of all exchanges and they seem professional.

Some of us prefer to have alts and would like to have safe storage options.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:01:41
Thanks for my first tip! Do you plan adding Omaha (PLO) in the near future? That's my specialty...
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:02:57
Does this potential 500% increase mean a huge drop for AsicMiner share value?
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:54:34
Good to know. Thanks.
