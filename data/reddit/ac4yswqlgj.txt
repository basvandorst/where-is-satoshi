It's only intrinsic value is that of it's paper and ink it is composed of, which is basically nothing.

False. Look at how the dollar was backed by silver. Like literally go look at a dollar denominated silver certificate and read the fine print. The word "dollar" was a legal definition of a weight in silver. The government enforced all banks redeem dollar silver certificates for a weight in gold. Backing means enforced redemption by an authority.
I understand your first inclination is to downvote me because it goes against your current perception, but really, seriously, go read the fine print on a silver certificate.

You're missing the point. When the dollar was "backed" by silver, Silver was the asset, and the dollar was the debt, an IOU, as in, "we the bank owe you xx grams of silver if you try to redeem this dollar silver certificate, and if we, the bank, don't do that for you, then the government will make us with their guns. 
What you are suggesting is "this piece of paper with ink on it has some intangible value to it, is actually pre-loaded with debt to the federal reserve, and if you don't use it, we will kill YOU.

It will be a cost when they move their funds, which will come directly out of their sales.

That's not what "backed" means. Backed refers to an enforced redemption. That is, you can trade one ounce of silver for a piece of paper with ink on it, by force of some authority - not simply some threat of violence for not using the  worthless item.

Except one side is giving (relatively a lot) more to miners instead of the intended recipient (higher fees).

It is in fact, an IOU, a debt instrument, owed to the corporation named Federal Reserve.

Federal Reserve Notes a.k.a. Dollars are not YOUR money. They are debt instruments to a private central bank.

Yes there is, they can decide not to do it for you, steal your money, and/or charge you more money that is reasonable for the effort.

Not insane. I'm a lawful citizen and a productive member of my community. I do have many firearms, two of them fully-automatic rifles. I carry a firearm (handgun) everyday on my side, everywhere I go. Never had to use it. Hope I never have to. But if that time comes, I am technically proficient(trained), insured, and mentally and spiritually prepared to use reasonable force to stop a bad guy from causing great bodily injury or death to an innocent victim in my presence, or myself. What are you prepared to do - Besides pull out your phone and call someone else with a gun to come help/stop the situation?

They do not allow lawful firearms merchants to sell hicap magazines. No thanks.
