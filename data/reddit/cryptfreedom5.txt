Stop trying to guess the price and showing here ok?
We need more adoption and knowledge about bitcoin and not price chart, stop being so irrelevant. 
Bitcoin is not only price.

way, you're saying that no one would make a transaction of 80 bucks? I would, and many third world country who own bitcoin would too..

So you're telling me that a guy was tortured for 6000 btc and killed.
That same amount of btc 7 years ago was like 50 dollar?
So that means even if you have any small amount of btc, in the future they'll chase ya for less..... This all sounds very creep, imagine someone chasing me for 0.01 btc

botting you get ban, now if you "farm" you'll make 30 dollar per month working 7 hours per day, if it's that much money for ya, you're very very poor.

@_date: 2019-09-14 00:50:59
I mean, anyone can say that they make this or that, but in reality it's always something else... Nothing is easy and I can guarantee you, they dont.

what? who cares about "seized bitcoins", we don't care about the law, and I'd definitely buy any bitcoin from anyone I don't care if it's "seized".

nowdays theyre only talking about chainlink, is it the "new bitcoin from 4chan" or just a scam?
