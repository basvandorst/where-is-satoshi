Overstockk's sales were disappointing, and costs unexpectedly high. Expected income is essentially priced in, so a miss like this causes a sell-off. On the other hand, Apple beat even the most optimistic of sales estimates.

Most retail businesses have very low margins. So, you buy a widget on Amazon which costs $10. Amazon's costs, all-in are $9.50, so they make a 5% gross profit (which is generous; Amazon's gross profit margin last year was only about 1%). Bitcoin drops by 10% in the time between you paying and Amazon selling the bitcoins you paid them. Amazon has now made a loss.
What on earth is good for Amazon in this arrangement? I can't see it being attractive to any retailer, unless they were extremely high-margin and getting some other advantage out of it.

Why on earth would it be? Credit card processing is not typically a big cost for large retailers (except for really tiny purchases), turning bitcoins into dollars is not free, and unless they did so very quickly they likely suffered from generally declining prices.
EDIT: It's worth noting, by the way, that even if most of the bitcoin purchases were really tiny, and there's no particular reason to think that, for most non-digital retailers, even besides payment processing costs, tiny purchases are rarely very profitable due to shipping and handling costs being pretty static.

I doubt it, really. It's the same phenomenon as those make-money-at-home-get-rich-quick-one-simple-trick web forums; people want to believe, and in general questioning the thing believed in is met with hostility. The idea that a forum will be objective unless there's a sinister external influence is not supported by the facts.

Possibly a regional thing, but in many countries, no, a salaried worker will never have done either of these things, especially if they started working in the last decade.

To be clear, I was exaggerating the numbers, as I mentioned. A 1% shift down would be enough to eliminate any gross profit (and likely result in a net loss).


That's _risk_. Retail businesses typically do not like risk. They like to know "If we price thing at X, we will make exactly Y cents on it", not "we might make 2Y or 4Y or -12Y".

The top-band income tax rate is 41%; they're including social protection charges etc. And going a bit high on it; the USC doesn't get that high until you're earning a fair bit more than 40k.

This is a classic form of self-delusion.
@_date: 2011-09-07 17:19:30
Many businesses inherently need substantial upfront resources to get anything done (as is the case in much manufacturing), or need to accumulate users (as is often the case for web businesses, say), or a combination (as with Google, which required vast amounts of equipment and a lot of users before it could become profitable, or indeed make _any_ revenue).


Well, that's a matter of opinion. Most of the modern computer industry, though, in particular, is built on companies which started out as startups and had to take on significant investment (Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc etc.)
One could probably have an industrial economy of sorts without proper investment, but it would be close to impossible for new players to enter it, and it would tend to be highly risk-averse.

Modern economies are largely dependent on inflation, ideally very little of it. Deflation, however, changes the entire risk profile of investment and lending, and tends to lead to liquidity problems.

I think it would be very difficult to do a Keynesian bitcoin; you really need a central authority there. However, one could certainly consider a Friedmanite bitcoin, with constant slow issuing of currency.

'Legal tax evasion' is normally called tax avoidance (or, more euphemistically, tax planning). 'Tax evasion' is normally only used to refer to illegal practices.

Even in relatively volatile things like the stock markets, a 10% dip in a day is major panic stations and has only happened a handful of times. In real proper currencies, discounting things like the Zimbabwean or Weimar Republic hyper-inflationary currencies, it's unheard of.

No easier than cash, really. Arguably more difficult, as there would be records of the employer transferring money to buy bitcoins, whereas in some situations (retail, for instance) they could take the cash from the till and misreport it.

While a reserve switch may come, it will not happen overnight. In the long term, yes, some countries may leave it, and some of that risk is priced in now. It won't be happening next week, though.

I don't think any court in the world would agree with you. It has repeatedly been found, in particular, that if person A makes an accidental bank transfer to person B, or even accidentally transferred valuable property to them, and person B deliberately retains it, then person B has committed an offence, though it may be theft, unjust enrichment, or something else, depending on jurisdiction.

And perhaps worse, anyone borrowing to, say, start a business or buy a house or whatever must bear in mind that, if they pay off the interest but nothing else, the real size of their loan is increasing (as opposed to decreasing as in moderate inflation). Deflation tends to make both consumption and investment riskier and less desirable.

20% inflation, while very high, is by no means hyperinflation.

Why would it? The major effect of the US credit rating drop (only one level drop, from one ratings agency, remember) will be to drive some extremely risk-averse investors (and banks looking for high-quality collateralization instruments) away from US debt, likely towards something which is perceived to be safer, such as German debt. 
I can't imagine why someone would say "my highly reliable US debt has become slightly less reliable; I had better sell it and put it into _bitcoins_, which are less stable in value than, say Greek debt".
EDIT: It is also worth noting that trust in the rating agencies is not what it once was; this has been expected for a while, and had started to be priced into the market before the drop came. 
@_date: 2011-08-06 18:50:19


Possibly not so drastically. A lot of it has already been priced in; it's not like this is unexpected. In addition, the value of most other global currencies has been heading down, too; the Euro due to the current Eurozone debt crisis, and the Swiss and Japanese currencies because their governments are increasing the money supply so as not to be disastrously overvalued.
@_date: 2011-09-07 16:55:54


How do you expect people to start new businesses without either borrowing, or investment (which is, for this purpose largely the same thing)? For instance, if you have a good idea now, what you do is get it to a reasonable point, and then take venture capital. Potentially quite a bit; companies like Google and Amazon took tens of millions before becoming profitable. If you're in a deflationary environment, the whole risk profile changes; it's suddenly far riskier for the VC to invest the money, and thus they will want more in exchange for it, or else not invest it at all.

Or at least, er, read the bloody docs before using something.
@_date: 2011-09-05 11:42:24


Er, no, it's the case. Even on major stock markets, which are viewed as rather risky and highly volatile, a 10% movement in a day would be very unusual; on major markets it has only happened a handful of times, and causes serious panic, suspension of trading, etc. As far as actual currency exchange goes, disregarding currencies which are actually in hyperinflation, at 10% movement in a day is simply unthinkable, and has never happened.

I'm not sure it's as simple as that. There have been cases where someone who had no authorisation to do so initiated trades with assets they weren't meant to have control over. See Nick Leeson, for instance; he was prosecuted, but the beneficiaries of the trades were not effected.

I'm pretty sure that any modern developed country deals with this very simplistic attempt at tax avoidance.
@_date: 2011-10-16 14:38:44
In most countries, something other than money given to employees as consideration is treated as 'benefit in kind' (sometimes called employee or fringe benefits), and is assessed for income tax. In addition, you obviously have to pay min wage in real money. Any attempt to avoid paying tax on non-money consideration would be tax evasion.
Capital gains might come into it if the value of the bitcoins increases before they dispose of them, but shouldn't be an issue for the employer.
EDIT: A somewhat similar situation is the case where an employer gives the employee shares as part of their salary. These are subject to income tax; if they subsequently increase in value they're also subject to capital gains.

It would be a matter for a court to decide, and it would be more likely to be found to be unjust enrichment than theft, but ultimately the recipient ended up with something which has market value which does not belong to him.

Nothing's free; there's a cost in terms of support and ongoing development to having a feature, so if you have a feature that no-one uses, the pragmatic thing is usually to get rid of it.
Accepting bitcoin would also have a cost on the accounting side; if a business makes $5 worth of bitcoin a month, that probably costs it money rather than anything else.
