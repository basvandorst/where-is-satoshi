From my understanding and "research", yeah I do believe this bull run is running out of steam and that these green candles are over extending themselves. Many people on both crypto currency subreddits and the twitter sphere express similar sentiments.

I recon Bitcoin will be consolidating around 7k in the first weeks of January. Thinking this bull market will keep going another 3 months is unrealistic.

Saying that traders aren't creating dips and that dips can only be attributed to early adopters realizing gains demonstrates a meager understanding of the market. 
Take the China FUD back in August as an example, due to fear of negative sentiment towards Bitcoin by the Chinese government many Chinese individuals and professional traders took what they could for the time being. They were not early adopters realizing gains... 
Trade is what drives the price of Bitcoin up and down. If we only had hodlers who sold at all time highs in order to realize their gains the market would be far from this interesting as well as lucrative.

I mean the consensus that a major correction is incoming is huge. 
If anything the article is right in encouraging people to sell, however it's also full of misconceptions and over confident FUD reducing its legitimacy to specks of dirt under my fingernails. 
Still, I'd rather sell than buy Bitcoin right now.

So what do the early adopters do when they realize gains? They trade  Bitcoin for fiat, effectively making them traders.
The only mechanism used to distribute Bitcoin is trade, people buying and people selling.

True, but looking at a chart can help you enter the market with an advantage and not be dismayed by potentially big corrections. 
Sure you can HODL and BUY DIPS, I have no problem with that... Its a safe way to play, arguably quite smart for the average buyer, but traders make the chart move and create those dips that you buy.
