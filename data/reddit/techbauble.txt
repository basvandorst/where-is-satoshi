How can he be so bullish on Bitcoin, saying, "Paper money is going away. And crypto is a far better way to transfer values than a piece of paper, that’s for sure.” but only hold .25 BTC? EDIT: the downvotes are curious. If he’s so certain his current net worth is going to be devalued, wouldn’t he transfer at-least a portion to the thing that’s going to bring the most value?

Depends on your jurisdiction, you may need a license. Regardless, you need a lawyer and not reddit commenters.

That would have been a better phrasing and measurement. I’m still curious who uses these and how often.

I assume you mask off areas you want to preserve while allowing/forcing the remaining area to oxidize and patina. Do you then seal the result to prevent the art from oxidizing into itself?

I suspect it’s because there is nothing preventing those people from taking their skills and finding another job. Unemployment is at historical lows and there’s a shortage of workers in most industries. These federal employees should have no issue getting a private sector job in less time than the shutdown has lasted.

Yikes. Sounds like an exchange that either has liquidity issues or some unknown government regulation. Neither are good.

$7023.64?!? Wow. Are people really paying a $600-$700 premium to use these things?
