I'm guessing his point was that mike hearn wanted some sort of control of bitcoin, and in saying bitcoin was a failure, selling his coins and leaving, he may have caused btc value to drop, and he can then reinvest his cash into even more bitcoin at a lowered rate?  Maybe? Something like that?  Gains control by personally sabotaging the system he wishes to have control of, much like Jobs did.

Unlikely.  If they're not on the blockchain, they're not in the system.  Blockchain.info has every transaction that's been completed or is pending to complete.   I just did that site you mentioned and there's nothing forthcoming from that either.  If you have bitcoin core with a checkmark, you've got it going.
I might add that bitcoin core is probably more than you need if you just want a local wallet for bitcoin.  One of the light clients like MultibitHD has some features you might like and doesn't store the whole 60GB ledger on hand.  Also supports encrypted cloud backups in case of disaster.

While it won't work for everyone, I've only dealt with QuickBT.  They're a Canadian company and they cater to dabblers, since they have a tiny daily limit.  I had an issue with a purchase stalled in verification after having 4 or 5 successful purchases and their support team responded within an hour, on a SATURDAY to ensure it was pushed through.  Can't say enough good about them.  I've had nothing but positive bitcoin experiences so far, it even dropped $100 for me the day I started buying.

This is the answer.  Just like how there's a fixed amount of gold in the world (barring fusion tech to make it out of lighter elements).  Today, gold is routinely bought and sold in 1 oz pieces.  If all gold was mined but demand stayed constant, each ounce becomes worth more and more, as there are fewer and fewer on the market, and smaller and smaller pieces of gold become the standard unit of commerce.
A whole BTC could become an unreasonable amount for us normies to expect to move about.

I also recommend password protecting the wallet so you have to type the password when you open Multibit in case someone gains access to your computer either remotely or from the keyboard.

@_date: 2016-01-19 13:07:40
Semi related.. I think one of the main hurdles to entry right now is that it seems complicated and unmanaged to neophytes.  I had heard of bitcoin for years, but only decided to purchase some a few weeks ago for the first time.  I'm a fairly technical person with 2 decades of IT experience, and it still took me some time to get it to a point where it's working smooth.  If I had used Electrum or MultibitHD from the outset, it would have been easier than anything the bank or even Paypal offers, but I didn't.  I followed some very rudimentary online steps and ended up waiting for three days for the ledger to download with Bitcoin Core.
Like Linux adoption, there's an ocean of options to entry, and like Linux adoption, it is intimidating as to which option to pick.
I have no idea what to do about that, as any more attempts at education via blog posts, reddit threads, youtube videos, etc, would just add to the noise that new users have to see.

My amateur take:
the more transactions per second the more hardware power you need to be the one who successfully mines bitcoins.  Very few authorities will have the processing power on their own to do this, so you see the fewer and fewer elite groups rising to the top as the controllers of the network.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:40:32
It could go up, it could go down, it could evaporate entirely.  I'm a dabbler like yourself and I have about 0.25 btc right now.  I'm hanging on to it, and if the price drops lower, I'll buy more.  I'm not putting any money into it that I'm not willing to risk losing, however.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:57:13
I'm not sure how much more transparent or robust a system can be.  You can see every single transaction ever from the inception if you look up either of the two party's public addresses.  Processing happening all over the world, interconnected by the most disaster resilient network ever created sort of ticks that box.
Trading anything that stays outside the purview of banks and government would have the same arguments against as what most of the suits have against bitcoin.  
Gold, silver, paper fiat, tide laundry detergent, goats.  They're all untraceable and irreversible (in that there's no button to push to reverse a charge), just like bitcoin.  It's the fear of the technology boogieman, and the need to be wrapped in an expensive security blanked with your bank logo on it.

Well, it's up to large groups of people with ASIC miners, which are hardware chips that are designed specifically for the purpose of mining bitcoins.  Search for the antminer 7 for an example.  Its esentially a 1600W space heater than might get you about as much return as the cost of the power it consumes.

So can you explain how this doesn't halve the value of both forks, if both stay active?  Wouldn't that mean a doubling of coins, albeit on different systems?  Say core wins the fork, couldn't I spend my bitcoin core coins at one vendor and then in the future if the classic coin network becomes accepted by vendors, spend the classic coins with them?
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:54:05
In all honesty, barring wild hopes and dreams, what should we expect from the halvening?  Reducing the rate at which new bitcoins are minted during a time that, hopefully, we are still onboarding more users, in my mind means that the value should gain a healthy upward trend, barring any major shake ups.  Am I way off in that naive appraisal?

@_date: 2016-01-17 02:44:27
If you set it up yesterday, its surprising that it has all the transactions already.  It took me about three days to process them all.   Chances are the tiny, likely fee-free transactions they send from dailybitcoins.org are being lost in the scrum of pending transactions.  If you go to blockchain.info and paste your receive address into the appropriate box, you can see the status of the transaction.  If it is still 'unconfirmed' then that's why you don't see it in your wallet yet.  The network is nearing saturation, so tiny little throwaway transfers like that take a back seat to the larger ones with incentive fees for the transaction processors.

There are many bitcoin wallets with various features.  Bitcoin Core, which is what I assume you got, keeps a full ledger of all transactions ever done on the bitcoin network.  
MultibitHD, Electrum and some others are lightweight wallets that don't do this.  They're quicker to set up and are more feature rich.
I have only used MultibitHD, but that one also offers automatic encrytped cloud storage backup via dropbox, google drive, etc so if your computer dies or you lose your wallet somehow, you can recover from backup easily upon reinstallation of the wallet software.
I started out with bitcoin core, not knowing any better, just like you did.  I downloaded MultibitHD, set up a new receive address and transferred all my bitcoin from Core to MultibitHD.  Cost a tiny transaction fee, but nothing worth worrying about. Now my wallet is much more useful.

I came in to bitcoin last week, so, me too..  From what I gather Mike Hearn was a big time developer of the Bitcoin network.  He didn't like the direction other developers wanted to take bitcoin, and took his ball and went home.  People panic sold because the sky was falling because Mike left, causing the price to drop.
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:42:10
The lead developer leaving in a huff is where most of the talk is coming from, so saying that even he says it is kind of misleading.  
I'm new, so take my opinion for what it's worth, which is not much.  I think bitcoin, or whatever it evolves into, will be around for some time.  I started buying last week and I hold a paltry amount compared to most, about a quarter of a coin.  
I think the utility of bitcoin will win out over the infighting over the direction of development.  By it's nature, user base consensus plays a huge part in its direction, so I think it will come out the other end ok.  I see this 'failure', which in fact just a stumble, as an opportunity to get some BTC on sale, as the media's clumsy reporting of the situation has caused public opinion to falter, which has driven the fiat price per BTC down.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:45:59

In many circles, you'd see the same reaction if you said you bought silver or gold.  Most people are limited to seeing their wealth represented as a digit on their statement from their bank.  The idea of holding wealth independent of government and bank is alien.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:18:27
Depends on if you intend to get government fiat back out of it.  If so, there's several routes, though not having any bank account is limiting.  You could just go to a bank and get one, they're generally free.
The other option is to collect your payment in bitcoin, then there are several online stores for silver and gold which accept bitcoin.  That's as good as cash (better many people say) as long as you have a way to convert it back from metal to fiat without incurring massive fees.
Get a bank account.

I might be wrong, and I likely am..  I see the reduction in mining (and, i believe, an eventual halting to minting new coins altogether in the far flung future once we hit the 21M mark) as switching the focus of those looking to gain revenue by processing the network from mining for newly minted coin to processing transactions for the microfees attached to them.  If there were however many transactions per second the network will eventually see when throughput is increased and adoption is more widespread, then there would be more people processing for those fees which would add up like a whale filtering krill.
This is where I get super fuzzy, but would processing transactions be more smaller processing rather than chewing on giant blocks that only heavy mining hardware can do?  If I'm right about that (and I'm not confident I am) then you'd see a resurgence of small timers setting up stuff to process in their computer's idle time to skim off fees as payment for their paltry processing power..

There's been predictions of quantum computing in many forms, and it's always 10-20 years out.  Has been since the 90s.  And 'bitcoin' is just the ledger.  The underlying tech could be adapted to appropriate quantum encryption if this tech becomes real-world.

In today's day and age there's almost no reason any merchant's debit/credit machine should ever be down.  If there is a week long power outage, perhaps, but there are at least three networks that can support connectivity to debit/credit machines; broadband internet, the telephone network, and the cellular network.  It would have to be an enormous outage for all three to be nonfunctional.  If the terminal itself is broken, there should never be a scenario where, if you only have one point of sale terminal, that you should not have a backup debit/credit machine for quick swap.

To my cobbled together understanding, The bigger the block, the fewer entities you'll see successfully performing mining.  Bigger blocks take longer to process, so the larger it is, the larger the gap between the elite miners and everyone else, because everyone who's not the best will take that much longer to process a block and the elite ones will have the one processed and the next one grabbed.  More processing time means less number of times miners go to the well for the next block, and that trip to the well is the place where miners are likely to get lucky and pull a block first to start chewing on it.  The fewer successful miners out there, the more control is in their hands.
I think that's the gist of it, but the technical details could be wrong. Feel free, anyone, to append or correct.

There are extensive records of every transaction, but I fail to see in any of these how they address that it's not anonymous.  I suppose if my computer was seized, as was the other party in a transaction, they could tell i sent or received payment by matching up the addresses...

There's a hard coded limit in the network that limits the speed transactions are handled.  Right now it's a couple transactions per second.  There were technical reasons for implementing this.  We are now hitting a threshold where we are trying to do more transactions than the system can keep up with and people's transactions are being delayed until the system is under less load.
A fork is when software is literally branched in terms of development.  Say you wrote DanielOS 1.0 and made it open source.  You continued development with the intention of making DanielOS 2.0, but some people looked at your code and said "this would be better in a direction other than what thinks is best, so lets 'fork' it and create our own branch.  Then there would be two forks under active development.  The one you are continuing to develop, and the one the community is developing in a different direction than yours.  The two are now separate pieces of software and are not going to be able to interchange all their stuff anymore. like a separate species.

Camera + QR codes have been working for those devices without NFC.  And you think your phone mic can pick up ultrasound well enough to decode data?  or your phone speaker transmit it?  Speakers have a range at which they function, and the amp in your phone probably rolls off at 22khz, since that's as high as a human can hear.

Doing what? going up and down?  Take a look at the US / Canadian dollar rate.  Right now Canada's dollar is lower than it has been in ages.  We live in financially interesting times and bitcoin is the wild west and still considered fringe and highly speculative by the financial world.
@_date: 2016-01-14 21:01:05
How can you know what your dollar is worth when IT fluctuates so quickly?  For an example; Today it's $14 for an ounce of silver, tomorrow it's $18.  That's the dollar fluctuating, not silver.  Bitcoin is still very young and speculative and somewhat volatile, it's true, but many people have faith that in the long run it will only go up in value.  Additionally, many people don't see the BTC/USD volatility because they don't even use USD as part of their equation.  You can go to many retailers both online and off and buy products for bitcoin at a fairly fixed rate over a short period of time.  As to your point about being obsolete in the next year;  Bitcoin has been around for 7 years, and a moderate player for at least 5 of those years.  The technology can, and most likely will, change, but Bitcoin isn't the protocol, and it isn't the technology, it's the ledger.  It's a credit sheet writ large.  Know what else is a credit sheet writ large?  Government currency.

I agree.. I was being somewhat tongue in cheek..  My point was that what should be, in theory, resilient and foolproof some times just needs bigger fools to come crashing down..

There's a different address for every transaction, and nothing to link the initial purchase to any subsequent transfers

I really don't know. All I can say with relative confidence is that an ecosystem finds its own balance and bitcoin is being led by some very smart people.  I suspect it will work out in ways I'm too ignorant to understand.
Edit: In fact, I'm fairly sure that I am spreading misinformation in the first post.  Don't take what I say as anything except naive understanding which could be false.

I started out with bitcoin core before I knew any better.  It really doesn't have much, but it works.  I went to multibithd after that, and I really appreciate the encrypted cloud back up as well as not having to download 7 years of ledger to use it.

For example, I decided to start an alternate miner yesterday, just for fun to see how poor a return it really way.  On a 8 core computer, running for about 12 hours, I've made $0.0001178 USD worth of litecoin.  I'm sure my computer running at 100% CPU for that time drew far more power than that to process it.  At this point you can join a pool if you want to assist the network processing effort, but as a money making scheme, a general purpose computer is not going to make you money.

Good lord, no.  Mining is not for mere mortals anymore.

Its legit in that it's a site that gives you a tiny amount of bitcoin per click.  They make money on the ad revenue of your clicking, considerably more than the fractions of a cent you get.

Everyone who knows enough to have large amount of wealth in bitcoin knows that it's happening.  However, just like the news has a great impact on the fall of bitcoin value by swaying public sentiment recently, the lead up to halving day will no doubt see half-informed news stories that will make a bunch of arm chair investors crack open an online wallet and sink some cash because it will make them rich.  That alone will raise the price around halving day, I believe.

Personally, I wouldn't store anything in an online account that I wasn't willing to risk losing.  Too many online wallets end up empty or with the account locked for silly reasons.

I'm from Canada and most I know use quickbt.com and it can deduct directly from a Canadian bank account via Interac.  Takes on average around 10 minutes from beginning of purchase to the BTC being in your wallet. Every trading post is going to be different and have different pros and cons.

Once your coins are not in an online wallet, they are anonymous. That's the point. They're like cash. They have no trace to you, and if you lose your wallet, you lose your money.
How illegal is this thing you're trying to do if you're this worried?
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:59:43
Are those all online wallets?  If so, there will always be a trace.  Why not use a local wallet like MultibitHD or Electrum or one of the mobile wallets?

This is the ONLY reason I hold a little bit of btc.  I don't put enough into it that I'll lay awake at night bemoaning my lost wealth if it tanks, but if I didn't put at least a little in, I'd feel really stupid if, for instance, the people of China adopt it as an unofficial currency for private transactions and suddenly it's 10K a coin.

Unless, as the actual quote states, it's in an early-stage nascent blockchain.  Which is precisely when Bitcoin rolled back transactions for the same reason.
