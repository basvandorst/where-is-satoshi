You imagined the goalposts




Only $3 and several hours. Wow! 


Oh, so this must be why retailers are dropping Bitcoin left and right, because retail is not an important application of Bitcoin!


Yeah, plenty of subs like to ban people with different opinions. This is my first time commenting on Bitcoin though.
Why are you so defensive?

Haha yeah! Bitcoin is only $6.95 per transfer where credit card companies charge 1%!

The wallet is irrelevant. If you want your transaction complete before 12 hours, you have to pay the miner toll.

Transaction time is important. If you want your transaction to finalize in10 minutes, you need to pay the miners absurd fees. Currently median fees are $4
The fees are high because the miners installed a 1 MB limit, artificially limiting transaction throughput.
Sure you can pay a 10 cent fee, but it could take days for it to process.
