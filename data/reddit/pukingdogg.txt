I guess my thinking is whats the point, if your making money, why go through the hassle of turning it to bitcoin?

Is there a way to buy bitcoin without a bank account? because the easiest way i have found is through coin base and you need a bank account for that. I am not too keen on giving bank info to sites and I am sure my parents would put me through hell as they hardly know the thing exists.

@_date: 2017-02-20 01:15:55
so is paypal...
i guess if you hold onto it you could gain a bit from the increase in price, idk ive tried to look for other scrypt coins(litecoin, dogecoin, ect.) but i cant really get any of the miners to work and it seem more stress than its worth, but thanks for the response!
