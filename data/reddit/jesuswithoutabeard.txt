If I had 121 million, or even less, let's say - 50 million - in liquid cash available and I wanted to both make a lot of money while also destroying confidence in BTC... I'd just buy up a lot of BTC over a long period of time [3-6 months] across multiple exchanges through shell accounts and then do a massive pump and dump.
It's be much easier.

Great work - thank you for doing this!
I wish I had the time and capital to do it, but there really needs to be a push for a global marketplace in BTC for services/products. Everyone saves on exchange rates [except for volatility - if they're not keeping it in BTC] and the money transfer fees [even PayPal].
As clearly shows - there's a huge possibility in providing services and product purchases across a wide gap that has not thus far been really crossed [except for maybe Nigerian scams].
I want to buy Kenyan coffee beans right from the source, and not pay a middleman. Roast them at home and have amazing coffee at a lower cost. I think this is possible, and BTC might make it much easier to do it. There's probably hundreds of other uses - we just need to get a good website/system in place to make it happen.

What the developers think doesn't matter all that much, because they make up a tiny percentage of the ecosystem and are replaceable [even in Open Source projects]. In fact, even if Bitcoin was a centralized, fully private venture/start up - you'd still have to do what users wanted, because otherwise they wouldn't buy your product. And without users, you have really pretty code that functions well but isn't worth using.
Once we hit the 1MB ceiling, we're fucked. That's what I think. Sidechains are in my opinion decentralizing in nature and will only make things more complicated in the long run [think of the amount of manipulation that goes on in blockchain dark exchanges now and add a sprinkle of wall street mentality].
If anything, I'd make sure that nodes are taken into account when it comes to the supermajority vote. It'll make things slightly more fair.

No - it would be a minimal figure with Auroracoin. +/- 500 coins with their block retargeting.


Sure. But you'll now have to tumble your BTC capital, which won't be easy with a large number like that, and also take time. You'll need to be squeaky clean with no transaction history from the address that can be traced back to you.


Why would they have mined and kept a stash of coins if not to gain value on it. Mining is expensive. Can they afford the loss on equipment/electricity/time?


Why? Alt-coins aren't threatening to BTC. In fact, I'd argue that they serve a very important purpose in the crypto world. They introduce and test new variations on things like algorithms, block retargeting, transaction volume and other concepts. It's an experimental field that can be used to test implementations for BTC in a real and concrete way.
Being hostile and openly promoting the destruction of altcoins is counterproductive to crypto-currency as a whole, no? It also gives the attackers a very bad image - which in turn can translate to further bad connotations for BTC.
I think you'd be better served taking that energy and using it towards something more positive and direct for BTC. Just my two cents though.

Would it not be possible for someone who holds x amount of BTC to manipulate an exchange with margin trading like Bitfinex with just a few accounts and some chart analysis?
The market offers hidden orders - so it's easy to do a large margin trade [short/long] and then move the market in whichever direction you'd like. Sell/buy bitcoin to trigger margin calls and buy/sell back to profit. Your only going to be losing the interest [which would equal a day's worth or whatever], the fees, and whatever you'd lose on buying/selling your BTC to move the market.
I'm sure someone a bit smarter than me can do the math on what one would need in terms of BTC to trigger a movement. 2.5:1 leverage + 13% margin maintenance included. 
EDITED TO ADD: It is my understanding that there are currently no legal ramifications for doing a bear raid/corner with BitFinex.

You need to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection equivalent Act in Alberta. Changes to Terms and Conditions without proper notice count as unfair practices, especially if fees or penalties are charged. I'd recommend having a look [HERE]( to find the right clause.

I'd rather focus money on educating the right people about the real benefits of using BTC. For example, a targeted campaign focused on educating the Spanish speaking immigrant/migrant workers of America on how to use BTC to remit their money home.
This could be done in conjunction with a targeted effort at establishing local exchanges in their home countries where their families can exchange that BTC for either the local currency or even directly for living needs [groceries, rent etc].
Now your BTC has been used to empower people and give them better options. It also keeps money away from the dirty politicians who will flip flop. Also, America is not the be all, end all.

Or they can use their leverage [having the necessary legal framework and approvals] to put together a service similar to BitPay/CoinBase/Kraken.
No one can fuck with the protocol, but a lot of money can be made working within it. Exchanges, wallet storage, payment processing etc. etc. They'd have to compete with the established players, but it could potentially open up a new and very successful profit stream.
Imagine if someone like Visa created a subsidiary division which deals only in Crypto. There's positives and negatives, but from a free market point of view, it could only be positive for BTC in the long run.

Hmm - what about something like this:
Sign up for voting requires you the enter a public address, a username and fill out a captcha. Finally after completing registration, you are asked shown a generated image with a specified, small number of bitcoin to send to an address. The amount of bitcoin requested is randomized.
Once the bitcoin transaction is received and matches the image, the account is verified.
The idea is to create roadblocks that would stifle hundreds of voting accounts being made, but not inconvenience a single honest user.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:43:41
First off, I'm mostly playing devil's advocate. Secondly, I like these types of puzzles [I consider this a puzzle as it's taking several different pieces to achieve something].
Nonetheless, here's my take on your proposed method:
We must consider the fact that acquiring $1M - or any amount that is worth the risk and cost - will have an effect on the X altcoin price unless done correctly. 
You didn't propose the length of time you considered for the purchase of $1M of X altcoin. I'm assuming you'll want to do it over a long enough period of time so that the price will not increase too much.
Why is this something to consider? A price increase will result in hashrate increase. This will be composed of A: Other multipools jumping on to reap profit, and B: Solo miners doing the same. If you affect the price in any way upwards, you risk losing the chance to gain the required hashrate necessary for an attack. There's also a cascade effect to consider - buyers might jump in on the coin further fuelling the increase in price + hashrate. You could start a pump.
Let's look at what real life altcoin can potentially become a target. Based on coinmarketcap.com there's currently 22 altcoins [not including BTC, PPC and coins which cannot be mined] with a cap over $1M. Anything below will guarantee an avoidable and large increase in price. The less time you spend on this part of the attack, the less risk in unforeseen circumstances mucking it up leaving you with a bag of coins you cannot do much with. There are so many altcoins now, all going through various pumps and dumps. Other "bad actors" could be plotting something too - your attack needs to be done quickly and strategically. There's too much at risk.
Of those 23 currencies, 5 have a cap over $10M, which would make the most sense for your attack since you could spend less time acquiring the altcoin without moving the market up.
Of those 5, only 1 has a hashrate which is vulnerable to 20 GH/s per the 26% attack mode, Auroracoin. 
Now, you will say, "Well, I don't need to purchase $1M. I can purchase less." True, that opens you up to a lot more vulnerable altcoins. But then you have to do the math - how much of X altcoin will you need to buy, so that the amount you'd spend on the Hashrate ends up being economical in the long run?
I don't believe the math adds up - on a total level - including the risks. 
Also, you can say, "I'll buy X amount of the altcoin and wait for the hashrate to drop, then do the attack." Ok, that's totally a great approach. But once again, length of time correlates directly to risk increase. You cannot assume hashrate will drop. You cannot assume price will be stable.
You are proposing an attack with a lot of variables, that would be carried out [one would assume] for the purpose of profit. The profit needs to be high enough for the risk factor. And the risk is so, so unbelievably high.
What's my take? The current altcoin biosphere creates unintended security protections. Speculation and profit seeking create movement towards coins that move upward, increasing hashrate and further securing said coins against a quick double-spend vector of attack.
TL:DR; It is too risky and uneconomical to attack an altcoin through your proposed method. Although possible theoretically, it is the equivalent of the potential for Bill Gates to make Intel produce specialized ASIC chips that outperform everything on the market today for the sheer purpose of performing a 51% attack on BTC. Possible, but unlikely.
EDIT: I forgot to address your title, which was actually the reason for my post. I disagree, MOST altcoins are not insecure. At least not as insecure as BTC is on a theoretical level based on your proposed method of attack. Other attack methods do exist... they must. But I don't know what they are. Whatever they are though, I feel, equal bad news for BTC.

The idea of a voting mechanism that's fair and secure, but can still be used anonymously really intrigues me.
The first question would be, who can vote? I think anyone with a stake in BTC [of any amount, or a minimum amount] should be able to. And all votes are treated as equal [having more BTC doesn't give you more voting power].
But, what about the people who have multiple BTC addresses with coins in them? They can vote multiple times. Well we can simply state that they are encouraged to vote only once, and most honest people will. But what about the bad actors who simply create hundreds of new BTC addresses so they can affect the vote?
First - it would be kind of expensive to create hundreds of BTC addresses and then send a small fraction of coins in them. That's considering a transaction fee is included in each transfer.
Also - we can try and create a method of analyzing addresses to see if they are related on the tree; so if there's 1000 addresses with .001 BTC in it that all relate back to one address, we can deduce that we might have a bad actor in play. Known exchange/pool addresses that pay out to legitimate users on a regular basis can be added to a whitelist to exclude from the vote rigging analysis.
Then there's the issue of errors and bugs, which such a system would inevitably cause, that can exclude true votes.
So the system would need something else, something much more concrete and verifiable to compare the anonymous votes to. A sampling size of sorts.
What if there was a way of offering voluntary verification, which might forego anonymity? The sample size votes have no added weight, they are equal to all other votes. But they do provide us with a verifiable trend.
Contributors, organizers, and community members can sign up on the website of the project - and can verify themselves and their public address, which can then track their votes. The verification process doesn't need to be too in-depth, but should be difficult enough so that making hundreds of verified accounts would prove an arduous task. We can also weigh in the contributions of those verified members, to see if they are active and can exclude non active voters from the sample size.
This confirmed and verified sample size can then be used for a statistical analysis of the anonymous votes. If a huge discrepancy exists between the sample size and the anonymous voting pool we can deduce one of two things: either there is something wrong with the proposed vote, in terms of how it affects the sample pool vs the general pool [and maybe the topics voted on need to be reworked], or there is a vote rigging initiative in place.
Now we can return to the blockchain analysis and try and identify if there are large blocks of votes which come from addresses not on the whitelist [ie. likely someone splitting their holdings to vote]. We can then temporarily ignore those addresses, and see how the vote results will change. I think it can be possible to run a comparative analysis in this way to identify bad actors.
Of course, this leads us to ask: If we identify a bad actor, do we exclude their votes? I don't think so - I think there's probably a method of equalizing their impact by assigning a valuation to the weight of their vote.
Anyway, just my two cents. There's definitely lots of variables and things I've overlooked. But it might get a discussion started.

If MC incorporates Bitcoin there's only really one way for them to do it that will give them both the edge, and the control they want - and in the long term, this will be bad for Bitcoin. NOTE: I will assume that actual BTC holders who wish to use an MC system will be the exceptional minority, and I'll touch on this later.
First off, they would probably take the BitPay route and create a system which includes both "cardholders" and merchants within the same sphere. This is their edge, as they currently already have a vast network of both cardholders and merchandisers, with the hardware and system in place. Merchants would have the option of receiving BTC as payment, but would most likely not even really be interested as the MC system is fiat based, and those that might want to, will be incentivized to receive fiat.
Cardholders will be charged fees. Not sure how they would work this in, but I would guess they'd take advantage of the existing "FEE" mechanism and incorporate that into their revenue stream structure. Included would be an APR - and most likely annual fees on cards which offer some benefits. Merchants actively seeking BTC would be incentivized via lower fees on transactions [to both compete with existing BTC payment processors], and as previously mentioned, an additional incentive for receiving their income in fiat. This would most likely be something like "NO FEE" on withdrawals to fiat.
By creating a closed system with "cardholders" entering with FIAT for BTC equivalent, and merchandisers being incentivized to WITHDRAW in FIAT - MC would risk less when it comes to the actual BTC that moves "out" of their system. They'd make money on purchasing BTC, as this would directly have an added percentage on it, and be initially [post bulk start up purchase] funded by "cardholders".
The less BTC they have to pay out, the less they will risk in losing on fluctuation within the pricing. Essentially, they would require a reserve of BTC that can cover payouts made to merchandisers and users wishing to opt out with BTC [although I doubt this would be allowed].
Why is this bad for BitCoin? Well - right now it's not. It would be a huge boost. But eventually when the rewards are reduced, MC's closed system will mean a huge amount of transactions occurring OFF blockchain. Which means a tiny fraction of fees making their way to miners. There's a whole lot of other negatives, such as reduced BTC in circulation as MC builds reserves. Plus obvious manipulation of price their vast holdings allow them.
Finally, to touch on the first point, I doubt any actual existing BTC users would really want to take advantage of this. MC's appeal will be for those who do not have BTC, but wish to obtain it and use it. I'm sure existing BTC holders could use their own BTC to pay the merchandisers, who, if opting out of BTC withdrawals, will mean more BTC for MC.
EDIT: MC + Bitcoin = BitPay x 1000000

Hmm, interesting. Even by attempting to borrow the coins, we come into a few variables. One, someone needs to have a substantial amount of coins. Two, you need to find this person and somehow get in touch. Three, you better not reveal who you are because chances are, after your attack, their coins will be worth a lot less [even if they receive collateral instead of AUR].
Let's use Auroracoin as an example, and the proposed 20 Gh/s borrowed hashrate:
Highest Yielding Coin right now is Netcoin
Cost of renting 20 Gh/s + 20% for two hours is 47.2667739 BTC
$1 Million USD = 490196.078 Auroracoin = 2171.98039025 BTC
Capital Needed for Attack = 2219.24716415 BTC
Perfect Storm Attack Profit = 2124.71361635 BTC
This does not take into account liquidity, organic price change, drop on sell, reaction to double-spend news.
How to consider loss though. Hmm, do you think it's possible to liquidate borrowed batch at exchange A before reorg? What will the hit on price be? After reorg, how much further will your sell-off plummet the price on exchange B?
Even at 80% loss on price from initial borrowing, you get 424.94272327 BTC. Which on paper looks great. But again, tons of variables. At smaller buy-ins you reap smaller rewards. And [like the WDC attack in Oct/Nov, an exchange like MCX can shut you down after reorg shows double-spend].
Very interesting.
EDIT: It just occurred to me that it's much easier, and somewhat less riskier to use the capital you have to instead pump and dump the price. With that much capital, you can easily push for 30% to 40% ROI on low liquidity altcoins.

There's always risk of that, but the chances of a one off buy order of that size is very low. Most manipulators would be using bots tied directly to the API, with rules on cancelling orders once a threshold has been passed. It's also really easy to increase price by simply spreading that 3,000 BTC over a price range.
Actually - lots of bots do this on low volume alt exchanges and it's really easy to manipulate the bots to outbid you, and each other for advantage. I managed a 10% ROI in under an hour on about 30% of the alt currency I was buying up while drunk one night. It was cute.

I agree with you. Bitstamp has a duty to provide due diligence in situations like this. Especially if they were made aware of information that may or may not tie their services to potential criminal activity.
We can take an anti-bank stance on this like wyager and others have made here. But it comes to down to basic ethics. We need to work as a community to root out and identify the shitty aspects of Bitcoin - the bad actors. For one, we're still in the legal grey zone and are more vulnerable, and two, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the community coming together to point out conscpicuous suspicious activity tied to one of the largest "heists" in Bitcoin history.

I'm just spitballing, but maybe someone more knowledgeable can pipe in on this. 
So, first off, I haven't seen anyone mention the importance of nodes yet. I mean, the node count has been going down - which is worrying in a landscape of miners moving more towards centralization. Full nodes are needed as much as miners in order to keep the network healthy. What I don't see is any incentive for anyone to maintain nodes [outside of a select few service providers].
Is it not possible to incentivize nodes? Ie % of transaction fees [30%/20%] get's redistributed back equally to nodes from each block. If something like this were possible [I am not sure of the feasibility], including such an incentive with a hard fork could also incentivize nodes to upgrade as they now have a reward for doing what they've been doing thus far for free?
As far as I am concerned, without any incentive for agnostic full nodes to be run - we'd have some big issues with the block size increase as the demand on space+network bandwidth would increase dramatically. And without agnostic full nodes, well - the network isn't healthy.

This is incorrect. The ECB, and EU nations have a lot at stake when to comes to making sure Greece doesn't go belly up economically. The effects of a full on Greek default, and change from Euro will have huge impacts on the global economy.
I'm sure the number crunchers have done the math and figured out it's less expensive to simply make loans that are unpayable [with "strict" stipulations in the hopes of change down the line], than let the whole thing fall apart. They are bound to lose more by letting Greece fail.

As a pool that's one [and not even a major one] of many, Eligius can do whatever it chooses to do - because ultimately it's the actual miners that choose where to point their hardware. As part of an actual consensus eco-system, it's free do whatever it pleases. All bullshit aside.
@_date: 2015-07-13 23:10:34
I wasn't conflating two ideas - I see the ECB and EU nations on the same level when it comes to seeing Greece not fail. The ECB has clear objectives it needs to meet legally, primarily to maintain price stability within the Eurozone and also to keep inflation at bay. If Greece fails, and causes a cascade effect, its objectives will be impossible to achieve. 
Finally, capital stock in the ECB is owned by the central banks of all the 28 member states - so they are intertwined immensely. Essentially - if Greece fails, invariably so will the ECB's monetary policy.

Unless an end user is filtering spam, they either rely on software, server side or third-party service provider spam filtering. All of which offer an easy method of accessing a spam folder. BTC spam filtering [via pool/miner censoring], does not offer this function in a straightforward way. Currently, pool/miner spam filtering amounts to quasi-centralization [in my opinion]. 
I think this is where the anger is coming from [?]. It makes sense, as pool operators can effectively choose what goes through the pipes and onto the blockchain. Which in the libertarian, Satoshi-land is not cool.
@_date: 2015-07-09 02:54:32
Based on the tradeblock bitcoin chart, there's currently about 41,000 BTC tied up in the mempool.
I bet a large percentage of that is not spam, nor transactions that are going to be making it into the next block or three.
@_date: 2015-07-12 07:06:04


Remember, that for Bitcoin to gain widespread use - it needs to be simple enough to be used by your grandmother [God bless her soul if she has passed on]. As much as it is obvious for you and I that a transaction with an insufficient fee is our own responsibility, to the majority of future users of Bitcoin, it's simply a bug.
This is why I said miners walk a fine line. Miners depend on the continued growth of BTC. BTC and users depend on miners. There's a line in the middle somewhere where they meet happily.
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:50:13
Seems like a very fine line is being walked in the identification of spam transactions; how they are treated by miners; and how they end up affecting the eco-system in the long term [people having unconfirmed, but legitimate transactions in the mempool forever and ever Amen].
Interestingly enough, 3.25 BTC in fees is currently sitting in the mempool. My guess is the majority of that belongs to the spam transactions. Some pool[s] are bound to eat that up during quiet times, "filling blocks with spam data" - but increasing profits, no?
EDIT: Wanted to add that the current amount of unsettled spam transactions has nothing on the gambling dust of one or two years ago.
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:09:36
Luke-jr of Eligius? Care to expand on your statement?
1. What do you consider "half-decent spam filtering"? Ie. How do you personally differentiate between spam transactions and "I think my wallet didn't add a large enough miner fee" transaction?
2. How do you reconcile the second part of your statement - "...you really should be reducing it..." with the fact that miners are the key component of settling [confirming] transactions - and this is an integral function of the protocol? In order for Bitcoin to function - whatever the block limit - the transactions must be confirmed in the timeliest manner [otherwise the protocol ceases to be useful].
3. Why do you think we need the 1mb limit?
@_date: 2015-07-29 05:26:26

One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet:
The numbers on the left indicate the amount of BTC. If you were to divide the green side [let's say] into lots of vertical lines - the "height" would say "There are X BTC on sale for N price + all the previous orders". The numbers are cumulative, adding up from where they meet.
The topography is created by the amount of Bitcoin at each price level [either lower, with buyers, or higher, with sellers].
When you look at the entire depth chart in one go, you can see the amount of Bitcoin which would have to be bought or sold in order to move to a specific price point. Those "sheer cliffs" - as people have pointed out - indicate that there is a large volume of BTC buying/selling at that price level.

@_date: 2015-09-09 17:44:17
It sure is how the math for market caps works. The market cap uses the number of shares in a system as its primary method of calculation. So for BTC, it's BTC in existence * the price. That's the BTC market cap. Now, the BTC in existence is theoretical in reality since we can't actually account for all of it. So assuming *n* BTC in existence, the actual number is likely smaller, thus increasing the value of each BTC that's in practical use while keeping the market cap the same [since it uses a theoretical but practical number as its basis].
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:03:13
Built in fees - which is fine, but they are dependant on price levels. Lower price = lower profit. If we can figure out the fee structure, we can guesstimate profit.

The Bitfinex drop on 4-13 @ 14:00 EST [on the hourly] was substantial [around 10k - with a final volume of ~ 19k]. I'm guessing it was a dump by someone with ill-gotten gains. Scams are literally bad for BTC.
@_date: 2015-09-09 16:07:58
Correct answer is actually: the market cap stays the same, but each BTC is worth a bit more.
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:06:44
Nope - only the known figure [BTC in existence] is used for the market cap. That number isn't constant so I denoted it using *n*. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 23:02:58
Because we don't know how many BTC are out of circulation [they still exist, but are not accessible for a number of reasons], and trying to guesstimate wouldn't be accurate. We DO know how many are in existence, and thus use that number as the basis of our market cap.
Think of it this way - if Apple has 200 million shares in existence [a number I just made up], they'll ignore all the potentially lost or tied up shares, and instead use the real figure as the basis for their own market cap [not exact, of course, there's a lot more that goes into Apple's valuation]. 
TL;DR: We like to use known figures to make concrete numbers, rather than theoretical guesstimates. It's more accurate.

@_date: 2015-11-06 01:24:42
This doesn't make sense to me - mostly because from my understanding, you'd be "tanking" the price on just that market [which I don't assume is a leader, ie Huobi, Bitfinex, OkCoin]. And since it's not a leader, buyers would swoop in to pick up the cheaper coins, effectively raising the price on that market again.
I may be wrong - if so, please elaborate.

First of all, it's not 30% of each and every pay-check. There is a step ladder system applied.

There's a lot of bloat being added already, for example through gambling sites. Sure, one could argue that the bloat from gambling micro-transactions is using BitCoin as it was intended. But, Link carries an inherent cost as the coins for the transaction are destroyed. This in theory would curb abuse and spam.
Finally, the current Link implementation for testing is running on Feathercoin, so no need to worry about BTC being directly affected - yet.
I think it's a very interesting proposal AND I can see it being used for really great things.

You mention 14GB on your hard drive, and you use the word "random data". That's an interesting term to use, because what is random? 
A large chunk of that 14GB are gamblers sending tiny amounts to SatoshiDice for example. An activity that's also illegal in a lot of places. So going further with your points of "illegal" data - wouldn't you now be aiding and abetting the process of gambling? Maybe another major portion are money launderers sending Bitcoin to hide money for "terrorism". Who knows, maybe some Saudis were sending Bitcoin to the Syrian Sunni fringe groups for weapons. Would that also mean that you are aiding and abetting terrorism by having the blockchain on your drive? What if you were mining as well - that's even more direct.
From a legal point of view - as ApplicableSongLyric points out - this whole area is intensely grey in itself. They'd first have to create a new law that states blockchain possession is a crime. But then they'd have to prove the *mens rea* [the guilty intent]. And that's another can of worms.

This thought process is so twisted to me. First off, I never said I loved taxation. I said it's a part of a system in place which mostly works. At least for me, I'm from Canada.
I went and had an ECG, multiple X-rays and an ultrasound done recently. Bloodwork and other tests. All for nothing, as there was thankfully nothing wrong with me. How much did I pay? ZERO. I drive on roads that are toll free and relatively well maintained. I pay for that privilege with taxes on gasoline and the fees incurred by the sticker legally required to be on my license plate. I'm fine with that. If something happens to me, if someone assaults me, I call the cops and they show up. If there's a fire at my house, I call the fire department and they show up. If I get a traffic ticket and I think it's bullshit, I use my rights and fight it [and win].
All of these wonderful things are afforded by the fact that a set of rules and laws exists by which myself and everyone else in Canada has to abide by. It exists through the taxation process, which although not perfect, works.
The idea that we can start some sort of multi-corporate, sovereign, quasi-anarchist society and NOT have to deal with any bullshit like the mafia or kidnapper example you used is ludicrous. The first people to take advantage of said system will be those who were kept in check by the system in place right now. If you think otherwise, you're delusional.
The only way this society you guys envision will exist is if it's 150 hippies on some commune somewhere, with no electricity, growing [and I quote 4chan] "two misshapen organic carrots and a potato that self identifies as a pomegranate" a year.

First off, I'm upvoting you because of your awesome approach to the discussion!
I understand where you are coming from, but I think you're misunderstanding the main method of data propagation [think about it, it's in the name!]. So, as pointed out below - Google is doing this already. You can find links on Google to child porn and explosives instructional videos. Does this mean that Google is breaking the law? Wait, how come they're still around?
The way Link functions on top of the Blockchain - the Link "data" is embedded in such a way that you actually wouldn't really know what it was unless you were specifically looking for it. It's just transactions as far as your node knows. Hence the "mens rea" approach I took.
Now imagine an alternative universe, where TSavo [the guy who wrote Link] kept it off GitHub and placed it on the DarkNet for [let's use your example here] pedophiles to use. Unless someone was looking at each and every single blockchain transaction - and volume of Link transactions would probably be negligible in comparison to standard transactions  - everything would appear to be normal. Maybe three years down the line a joint task force fighting child abuse would release a statement and it would hit the news - "Bitcoin Blockchain used for illegal child porn!". For all those three years, everyone who had a node running, or was mining, was technically directly involved. But they weren't aware of it. What happens then?
You said it yourself - "It's just a Bitcoin transfer medium".

You don't tax the Bitcoin - you tax the value of that Bitcoin as it pertains to the currency within whatever society it is meant to be used in. Until Bitcoin can theoretically exist as the basis for all aspects of acquisition, production, and consumption of physical goods, intermediary methods of conversion will be relied on. And these conversions will be taxed - as they should - by the respective governments to which said Bitcoin users belong to.

I'm just going to leave [THIS LINK]( here. 
EDIT: IANAL - but as far as I can see there's a few challenges and arguments to be made for this:
1. Bitcoin as a protocol, albeit fairly new, is in essence a direct competitor to current mainstream banking, money transmitting, and money collection technologies.
2. Preventing a small business from participating in the sale of services which are not illegal - but that may be perceived to be directly posing a risk to a payment processor - is borderline illegal in its own sense for various reasons.
3. From a theoretical point of view, it would seem not unlikely that current payment processors and banking institutions have colluded with regards to Bitcoin policy across their services and systems. This would trigger Antitrust legislation and if proven... well, I guess they'd pay a fine or something. 
Either way, my feeling is that any Corporation in the business of either banking, payment transfer and processing is directly economically threatened by Bitcoin, its protocol and its innovation and as such the potential for abuse of their current monopoly is extremely high.
Legal action should and could be taken - there is currently a lot of money pouring into Bitcoin services via VC. Anyone involved in that game will be hard pressed to let illegal stifling practices affect their investments.

It'd be nice if they had someone give them some really good talking points in how to explain Bitcoin. Succinct and easy to understand, not this:

"Right, so there's uhh.... miners mint Bitcoins about every ten minutes uhmmm and it's basically a computer algorithm and it's a..."
Da fuck?!
It should be, "Bitcoins are minted as a means of rewarding people, called miners, who use computing power to add blocks to the blockchain - which is like adding pages to a ledger. In other words, those who successfully process the transactions on the network get rewarded with newly minted coins. There's a bit of luck involved, but that's basically it."

I like how you make an assumption that somehow I've been brainwashed and can't think for myself. 
My opinion? Fuck Friedman, fuck libertarianism, and fuck most of the naive anarchist thinking out there. Taxation and government have come about historically, I could even argue organically, as a response to very many different factors. Some good, and some bad. Unfortunately, the majority of current systems in place are inherently corrupt and impractical - but that doesn't mean that the basis for their existence is. There are also many systems, based on government and taxation which are extremely efficient, successful and should be relied on as examples for what the failed states should do. 
And that's just working within the framework of the global situation as it is right now, rife with overpopulation and reliant on technology and resources which promote the problems we face. In order to maintain our standard of living, we will have to individually decide where we want to fit in. But there's definitely no practical and realistic method, in my opinion, for the ideas of Molyneux and Friedman to be implemented on a global scale.

This sort of mentality baffles me.
A hundred years ago people like these fought and died in the streets for 8 hour days and a minimum wage, they fought so their children didn't have to work in mines and factories. The current system is corrupt and unfair. It's time for another reset. The fast food and Wal-Mart employees are taking the risks so changes can be made that affect almost everyone positively.
If you think asking for $15/hr is crazy then you haven't really taken a look around. Other countries provide much higher minimum wages - and social benefits like healthcare, education. America's minimum wages haven't be keeping up with the increasing cost of living and inflation. People have a second, or third job just to stay above water. How is that fair? How can you criticize them when they're fighting for everyone's right to a living wage. EVERYONE.
