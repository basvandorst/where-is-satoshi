This is irrelevant until Lightning is something other than vaporware. You admit yourself elsewhere it may be a year off, and in software terms, that means several years of bug fixing. (Not to mention being implemented across wallets.)
Lightning does not exist. There is no guarantee it will ever exist, until it's actually built and functioning. What is so hard for you to understand, that we want to see a concrete plan for the scenario where it does not exist or does not work out how it is intended to?
Until Gavin started pushing, your plan was simply to "wait and see". That attitude is utterly unhelpful for something with a multi billion dollar market cap and a whole lot of users.
This is entirely the problem with your anti increase group: You just want to muddle around in the dark with your experiments, rarely bothering to communicate with or placate end users and stakeholders. It's the proverbial bad example of how not to run a software project.
If you truly think "wait and see" is a valid plan, then it should be clearly written with exact specifics as to what amount of transactions will prompt you to increase the block size, precise time frame you expect Lightning to be ready by (and if/how you will reconsider block sizes if it is not widely deployed by that time.)
The threat of Bitcoin XT has served to prompt other devs into actually talking about this problem publicly, and even if Bitcoin XT never replaces Core, I'll thank Gavin for having the courage to give you guys the kick you needed.
