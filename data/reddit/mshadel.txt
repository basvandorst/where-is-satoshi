Mycelium for Android for my wallet, and Bitpay for the payment to Microsoft.

I actually considered that first, but I thought using bitcoin directly with Microsoft might help validate their decision to accept it in the first place. Clearly I was wrong. Their support reps don't even know what bitcoin is.

Thanks for reading all the way through. I agree, Bitcoin did not cause the problem. It was Microsoft's implementation of a bitcoin payment gateway that prevented me from solving it. Now, Microsoft has an angry customer and a little bad PR, I'm out 75 bucks, and bitcoin is unaffected.

After doing some research online I've discovered that there's no federal requirement to offer refunds except in the case of defective goods. Most states offer no protection either. So, "Buyer Beware". Or in this case:
When buying from Microsoft, BEWARE!
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:24:32
Beware of thinking that Microsoft will:
Accept their own currency for one of their own products.
Value customer loyalty enough to offer a refund.
Train their support staff to be aware of all the payment options they provide to customers.

Sure, collecting some stats to guide your strategy is always a good idea.
If you do decide to include offline listings, consider using a common visual indicator to show that something exists but is not an active option at the current moment. Specifically, display offline listings with a faded image and grey text instead of black. Maybe add an "OFFLINE" flag in the listing. Those looking to buy will ignore the listing, but those researching price or looking for the most reputable vendor may choose to get the details now and come back to buy later.

Sure, my company will accept payment via Lightning Network. That was easy!

I think the Bitfinex hack and (ongoing) collapse is a needed part of the growth of the ecosystem.
The Gox collapse showed that bitcoin was considered real money and needed real security and transparency. This Bitfinex hack shows that relying on a third party (Bitgo) to approve transactions without human review and judgement is not safe enough. Exchange owners will learn that funds must either be store offline or require the approval of a third party with the judgement to identify a potential theft and put a stop to it. Exchange users will learn that an exchange without insurance is an unacceptable risk.
I predict that this breach will drive users to the exchanges that prioritise security over features. Gemini comes to mind. The rise of Gemini may be what drives approval of the COIN ETF and brings in the flood of new investors.
tl;dr- growing pains, short term down, long term up  
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:38:13
Think of it like looking through a store window when the store is closed. If you like what you see you can come back and buy it later.
You can use the uptime metric as a test of reliability. If a store is offline most of the time, don't show the listings. That will filter out the abandoned storefronts. If it online most of the time, show the listing, uptime metric, and last time seen. This will signal to the buyer that if they come back later there's a good chance the store will be open.

Now you're just changing the subject. The same merchants who accept bitcoin now will accept via LN once the infrastructure is rolled out.
I haven't noticed any abrupt stop in merchant acceptance. None of the merchants I buy from have stopped accepting it.

I found several items on duo that were actually offline when I went to visit the OB store. I suspect it will be very difficult to pull listings from duo as soon as the store goes offline.
Caching listings and showing "last online" would help. You could drop listings after they have been offline for a certain amount of time.
Even better would be a "percent uptime" to help identify stores that are rarely online or have been abandoned.
Better that that would be a "notify me" option that sends an email or text when an offline store comes back online.

If you leave a penny for a tip in a restaurant you are going out of your way to express displeasure at the service. The tip is disproportionate to the service you received. But a penny tip for something online, like agreement with a comment on a message board, is appropriate. Why?

Personally I wouldn't trust any electronics for long-term storage - they will silently fail in time. Print some paper wallets, laminate them, transfer blocks of coin into them, and hide them somewhere. Give a second copy to someone you trust to store with their valuables or use a safety deposit box. Check the balances regularly via public key. Move the coins if there's any sign of trouble with your backup person.

This report is fearmongering, plain and simple.
Do you report every quarter you find on the street as a taxable gain? Do you pay barter taxes when your buddy buys you pizza after you help him move? How about when you buy a new ironic t-shirt online from an out of state vendor who doesn't collect sales tax?
 If the IRS hunted down everyone who misreported their taxes, 95% of the population would be getting an annual audit and IRS reform would be the central issue for every politician running for office.
The IRS doesn't care about the small taxable gain from the bitcoin you spent on your latte. Even if they did they would spend more money auditing you then they would collect in taxes and penalties.
The people that need to be worried are folks buying cars, yachts, etc. with bitcoin. If you can afford to spend at that level you'll need to track your cost basis or pay an accountant to do it for you.

Exactly. Their use case makes no sense for a new blockchain but works perfectly with a bitcoin-based system like Mastercoin, Colored Coins, etc.
If they create their own blockchain they have to build their own centralized mining network from scratch and figure out how to prevent others from participating. There will be programmers constantly looking for ways to mine their own blocks to get free state-backed money.
With Mastercoin (or equivalent) they simply create a billion units of the new coin and distribute them to banks to trade to citizens for their real pesos. Nobody has to mine anything and the whole thing is protected by the already established bitcoin network. In fact, the gov't would then be motivated to mine bitcoin to help ensure their national currency remains safe.

I ran out of bitcoins recently and have not replenished yet. After making my last few purchases from Newegg I've found I don't want to buy from them again until I have more coin handy (soon!). Why? Because sooner or later they will get hacked and my credit card info will get grabbed. Then it's up to me to replace the card and dispute any charges. The CC industry has tried to make that process quick and painless but it's ultimately up to the consumer to clean up the mess when a merchant gets hacked. That's just not right.
Imagine if you moved into a new neighborhood where residents were not allowed to lock their doors. Everyone there has free insurance that will reimburse you if anything gets stolen. It's your responsibility to notice when something's missing and file a claim for reimbursement. It only makes sense if you accept that you have no means to secure your property in the first place. Once you realize you can lock your doors you'll never go back to the old way of doing things.

Bitcoin's value is not tied to its transactional capacity. It's tied to supply vs. demand. Small and cheap transactions will have to move off-chain at some point. I suspect it will have to be done in a way that bypasses the miners' ability to block it.

Theory: PBOC has determined that bitcoin is here to stay, and banning it outright would leave the Chinese behind while the rest of the world builds the next gen infrastructure and profits. That looks bad for The Party. But, bitcoin must be monitored to prevent money from leaving the country, and the PBOC must be able to manipulate the price to some extent. So, they freeze bitcoin withdrawals at the big exchanges to put their monitoring systems in place. At the same time, they order the exchanges to review all accounts to ensure the documentation is legit. That could take a month or more. The bitcoin from any fake (presumably foreign) accounts are claimed by the PBOC. Now they have a big, free bitcoin stash available to tweak the markets as they see fit.
On the upside, SEC regulators determine that Chinese volume is mostly real and KYC/AML rules are being enforced on the Chinese exchanges. With that in place, they can safely approve the ETFs.

The research shows 1.7x increase over the course of a single year. The global average bandwidth increase is a more modest 1.21x year over year. But segwit is a one-time increase. After it's deployed, future scaling can move to LN or whatever layer 2 solution emerges as the best option. So even using the 1.21x numbers, average speeds will quickly eclipse the data increase from segwit and improve decentralization.

An excellent read, thanks to the author for such a clear and concise explanation.
In addition to the support Nasdaq will lend to bitcoin the transactional unit, there's another big benefit as well. Depending on the blockchain to protect the value of stock assets gives Nasdaq a strong incentive to keep the blockchain secure, even if mining rewards are no longer profitable at some point in the future. There has been debate since the beginning about whether miner fees would be valuable enough to keep miners online once the block reward has halved a few times. If the blockchain is the foundation for Nasdaq's asset ledger they'll make sure there's always enough mining power online to protect the system from a 51% attack, even if the mining itself is not directly profitable.
Once Nasdaq is on board, building and securing an alternate blockchain will be even less appealing to the rest of the investing world. The day this program goes live will be a real turning point for bitcoin.

This is a common problem for people with illiquid assets, like land. The answer is simple. Take out a loan with the bitcoins acting as collateral. Banks will give you a good rate if there's very little chance of default. As an added bonus you won't have to pay taxes on the cash because taking a loan does not count as taxable income.

Another option with no need for a bank: sell the private key for an address with a few thousand bitcoins at a steep discount. Include a contract stipulating that the coins can't be moved for 5-10 years.
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:11:50
Likely never. With LN, miners would be competing with a whole flood of new channel operators, who can earn transaction fees without maintaining warehouses full of miners.
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:40:06
Rather than sharing the private key, hire a law firm to write up a contract showing proof that Satoshi holds the private key and agrees to deliver the coins once the 5-10 years have passed. If he fails to deliver Satoshi will be sued and likely revealed to the public in the process.

"Why is there no two million user war today? A $1000 bitcoin price is not bad for them. When will we have war? When the bitcoin price crashes to $200.”
Mow is right on the money here. With price going up and transaction fees increasing, miners have no incentive to change. That why so many of them aren't signaling support for either BU or SW.
Miners won't act until fear forces them to act.

A lot of people assume that if BU were to take over, the miners would push quickly for large blocks, which would favor large miners in China who do not have to cross the Great Firewall to propagate blocks. This would centralize power in a single country. Hence the name "ChinaBU".
But, large blocks would remove fee pressure, such that even an increase in transactions would lead to overall lower block transaction fees. This is against the economic interests of all miners.
So, what would really happen? Pools would work to keep blocksizes as small as possible to keep fees high, and increase them only when people start talking about abandoning bitcoin for coins with lower fees.
It's like that scene in "Deadpool" where Wade Wilson is given just enough oxygen to stay alive, but never enough to breathe comfortably.
Ironically, activating segwit by hardfork AND increasing the blocksize would be bad for miners because it releases fee pressure two different ways: greater on-chain capacity now and layer-2 transactions later. Even the segwit softfork relieves fee pressure (2.1x effective blocksize increase) with layer-2 transactions coming in a year or two.
The only compromise that enables layer-2 and preserves miner fees now is a SMALLER blocksize + segwit with built-in slow blocksize growth. Despite seeming counter-intuitive, it enables layer-2, protects miner fees, and allows for conservative scaling over time.
And the best part - LukeJR proposed this exact solution back in January. It was not well received. In my humble opinion, this is the exact compromise we're all looking for.

Interesting question. In the world of people, "intent" is a concept that must be interpreted (by people) and can weigh on the outcome of a conflict.
If ETH's core concept includes that idea that the contract both defines and enforces the law, then "intent" is irrelevant and exploiting loopholes is a legal and valid means of participating in the DAO.
That said, rallying support for and implementing a hardfork is equally valid, because if a hardfork cannot be prevented by ther DAO, then it can't be considered against the "law" of the DAO.
I would say there are no real ethics at play here, just opposing groups competing for advantage.

Two reasons. First, it dumps 5x more new coins on the market, creating constant selling pressure. Second, it compresses the 4-year reward halving into a single year or less. The block reward will be less than a single coin only 4 years from now.

Great summary! Originally I assumed that large miners would have to work together to ensure BCH was abandoned long enough for a few "emergency" difficulty adjustments. But then I realized that miners don't have to coordinate. All they have to do is configure their pools to mine the most profitable chain. If most hashpower follows profitability, the cycling will happen on its own. And it will keep happening until BCH profitability/hr in its "manic" phase drops below BTC's profitability/hr.
If true, BCH will inevitably be overmined to extinction.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:22:20
Yup. Check out this chart:
The blue line represents how much faster BCH is mining that the normal 6 blocks per hour. It's currently at 4.89, which means BCH will reach the halving 4.89 times faster.

Many investors assume that, if they hold their coins directly, they will eventually screw up the security and lose everything. An ETF is much more likely to provide insurance and professional-grade security. And if they do screw it up, you can sue them.

I don't think that was the original intent behind BCH. But the emergency adjustment code has upset the balance of incentives that are the true genius behind bitcoin.

First, remind your dad that this is a speculative investment with the potential to change rapidly, fortunes have been both made and lost with bitcoin, we are currently at an all-time high, and you are not advising him to buy, only helping him to execute HIS decision to buy. Shake on it.
If he just wants to invest, help him safely print out some paper wallets (bitaddress.org) and keep copies in his home safe and a bank safety deposit box. He can keep another copy of the public key outside the safe if he wants to be able to add more later.
Get him to set up an account at Gemini or whatever exchange he prefers. Buy some bitcoin and withdraw to the public key. Confirm the funds are there using your favorite block explorer. Lock those keys up in the safe.
If he wants to add more over time, he can always buy more and send to the same public key.
To track his investment returns, he can use a mobile wallet that allows watch-only addresses (ie. public keys) or just check the account value on a block explorer periodically.
EDIT: Print those keys with a laser printer. Avoid inkjet printers and thermal paper. When storing, don't fold the paper where the fold could damage the QR code.

I suspect it boils down to simply being a matter of vision. Those miners who are simply trying to maximize return on investment oppose segwit. Those who have an interest in the long-term viability of bitcoin support it.

Here's a (relatively) simple way to track the state of SegWit adoption in the menu bar on your Mac. The number represents the percentage of blocks since the last difficulty adjustment that are signaling SegWit support. When the number hits 95, the activation threshold has been met.
A simple shell script reads the numbers from an API, and BitBar displays them in the  menu bar. Mac only, sorry.
First, install BitBar
Next, install 'jq', a command-line json parser.
Last, create the 'segwit.sh' script with the following contents in your BitBar scripts  folder. Make sure the file is executable.

Miners oppose segwit because they worry the rise of payment channels will eat into their miner fees by moving payments off-chain. 
Core opposes a hardfork because it would demonstrate that the blockchain is not immutable, which is off-putting for those who build businesses based on the blockchain. Plus, larger blocks don't address confirmation times and increase the hardware and bandwidth requirements to run a full node.
Many people here have been fooled into thinking there's a conspiracy on one side or the other.
The simple fact is, regardless of technical merit, segwit is not in the economic best interest of 95% of the mining community.

The next few days will be interesting. :) If all the BCH hashrate disappears after the difficulty adjustment and the "emergency" reduction triggers, miner exploitation will be undeniable and the BCH bagholders will start selling.

If BCH hashrate sticks around after the adjustment, the game continues.

With the emergency adjustment rules in place, the most proftable way to mine BCH is the method we're seeing now -  a mining manic phase followed by a deadzone to re-trigger the adjustment. This will repeat over and over. Eventually, BCH buyers will realize that miners are dumping 5x more coins on them and block rewards will cut in half every 6 months. Transaction fees will remain near zero since the blocks are so big and new blocks are being found at 5x the normal rate.
Sooner or later, this downward trend will be undeniable and there will be a race for the exits.

Great discussion, guys. You both deserve kudos for digging into the details of this issue, while remaining polite and respectful the whole time.
The big blocker perspective boils down to a fear that by a successful layer 2 solution will divert profits from those who provide layer 1 solutions - miners. And that's likely true... in the short term. But it's important to remember that bitcoin was designed to keep miners barely profitable through the difficulty adjustment process (a stroke of genius in my humble opinion).
Let's imagine that segwit activates and 90% of transaction volume moves offchain relatively quickly. Miner profitability drops. The least efficient miners start losing money and turn off hashpower. Difficulty adjusts downward. Some of the hashpower returns. Balance is restored.
Meanwhile, LN has enabled a massive increase in transaction volume, instant confirmations, and lower fees to make microtransactions feasible again. The whole ecosystem grows and everyone wins. Even the miners!
It's all a matter of seeing past the short-term pain to realize the long-term gain.

Lightning Network addresses this issue, although not perfectly. From the user perspective, payment channel transactions appear to settle immediately.

I can totally support this solution. But will Wu/Ver support it? I asked Wu a few weeks ago if he would support segwit plus a 2MB block size increase and he - predictably - didn't respond. Without his support, no solution requiring 95% agreement will ever be implemented.
We need to get the leaders of the community, including Wu, Ver, and the other anti-segwit pool operators, into a room with a skilled mediator to hash this out. Identify the primary goals for each party and look for a compromise that satisfies everyone. SegWit2MB seems like a great place to start. If the room comes to agreement, draft something up, collect signatures, and put an aggressive timetable in place. If not, people can get on with UASF and a likely chain split.

Mining is a critical part of securing the integrity of bitcoin. It prevents counterfeiting, reversing transactions, etc. The act of mining itself is expensive - it requires custom hardware and lots of electricity. Without a mining reward, there would be no incentive to mine, making bitcoin insecure and therefore worthless.
More importantly, mining is just another way to acquire bitcoin. The people who are rich from mining are rich because they held onto their bitcoin instead of selling it.

One option you presented earlier this year seems like it has potential.
If I understand correctly, this would provide the 2MB blocksize increase, while maintaining the 4MB block weight. End result, NYA gets the 2MB blocks they want, and small-blockers do not see the total block size increasing beyond what is already possible with the current segwit. If the NYA folks agreed this would meet their criteria, and Core wrote and endorsed the code, everybody wins.
Apologies if I have misunderstood the proposal specs, I'm just looking for solutions to avoid a huge clash in November.

This is exactly my point. You are looking at 2X as a parallel chain. While technically it is, economically it's not. It's an upgrade. For 2X to be an upgrade, 1X needs to die quickly, and the lack of replay protection will ensure that it does, because coins on 1X will not be considered safe.

I feel your pain, TeknoBlast. Microsoft never did call me back from my issue a month ago. I was fortunate enough to have a sympathetic Microsoft employee buy me a Gold account using his own money. So I can conclude that Microsoft has some poor policies, but at least they hire good people.
I've also learned that Microsoft really, really wants to have your credit card on file purchases. I was hoping bitcoin would let me get around that, but no dice. Last week I was trying to set up a sub-account for my son so he could have his own saved games, friends list, etc. Turns out Microsoft requires you to have a credit card on file to prove you're a parent. There is no other option available. It's sad.

If the community has split, why are mining pools like Antpool still mining Bitcoin and signaling NYA? Why are services like Bitpay confirming their commitment to 2X? If they had gone their separate ways this conflict would not exist.

Keep in mind that if you observe a lot of people doing something really fucking stupid, you probably don't understand their real motivation. Except for Juggalos, those guys are legitimately stupid.
Bitcoin has the brand, the infrastructure, and the massive network that everyone wants. Forking off to a new network is failure. Nobody wants to start over. But the current transaction limit -- even with segwit slowly rolling out -- is a real problem. The people making money from bitcoin need it to grow, but Core won't budge on a blocksize increase. Like most brilliant engineers, Core suffers from hubris. They believe they know best because they're smarter than most of the people around them. But unlike most brilliant engineers, they don't have a boss telling them to quit arguing and just fucking do it, or you're fired.
The 2X part of the NYA -- the hard fork -- is the community's way of saying, "Just fucking do it or you're fired."
 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:32:45
I think much of the community, including NYA people, would prefer to keep the Core team because you guys have been delivering quality code for years now. I seriously doubt there would be a mass exodus away from Core if you made and endorsed a 2X fork. Since neither of us can see the future, we'll just have to disagree on that one.
Also, "LOL no" is not very convincing, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:47:19
Core should incorporate their own 2X code into the main repo and do it without replay protection. It's the best path forward.
* It allows the NYA signers -- which still has 94% miner support -- to keep their word and fulfill the agreement
* It allows Core to maintain control of the main repo, which most people want
* It is widely considered safe from a decentralization standpoint, especially given the ongoing increase in available bandwidth around the world
* It provides some immediate relief from full blocks while segwit and LN gain support
* It will be needed eventually if Bitcoin has any hope to scale to compete with existing payment processors, currencies, or investment assets like gold
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:43:06
Don't you see? The 2X code is not the attack. Bigger blocks are less profitable for miners! The attack is the attempt to replace the Core team with coders who are open to corporate influence. The NYA folks have framed this whole conflict so they look like the reasonable side, fighting against an entrenched Core team who doesn't care what the community is asking for. By digging in their heels, Core reinforces that image. When 2X goes live in a couple months, the NYA messaging will be: 
"Look, we tried to compromise. We agreed to segwit in exchange for a very small block size increase. An increase many of the Core people themselves said would be needed soon. We kept our promise with segwit, and now we expect 2X in return. Since Core refused to participate, our only choice was to replace them."

Regarding max block size, this article concludes that the safe max block size falls somewhere between 4 and 12 MB, and continues to rise over time.

@_date: 2017-09-28 14:50:18


The 2X part of Segwit2X has always been described as an upgrade to bitcoin, not an alternative to bitcoin. NYA signers don't want a new coin, they want one chain called "bitcoin" with 2x the capacity.
Alsom, from an implementation standpoint, if replay protection were added and segwit2x were to become a new chain existing alongside the current segwit1x, all those miners, service providers, developers, etc. would have to update their software to follow the new chain instead of the old one.
So, adding replay protection would lead to an undesirable 2-chain end state and create a substantial amount of new work for anyone wishing to make use of 2X. That's why the NYA camp doesn't want it.

I had been wondering why the Core team has been so slow to roll out a fully segwit-integrated client. I would have thought that would be a high priority for them to spur segwit adoption among the services that rely on the core codebase. But why do all that work only to have it copied by the competition? I'll bet Core releases 15.1 shortly after the S2X split.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:12:15


I have seen this repeated again and again. It is simply not true. The NYA is a compromise to both activate segwit and increase the block size to 2MB to prevent a deadlock that was negatively impacting bitcoin. That's it. If you remember it differently, go read it again right now.
It is widely understood that the base block size needs to increase eventually, even after segwit and LN are widely adopted. A 2 MB bloc ksize right now, in 2017, will not destroy or centralize bitcoin. The real issue is the transfer of control away from the Core team. Personally, I would hate to see that happen. Core is in the position to both unify the community and retain development control with one simple action: endorse 2X and release an official 2X version of Core. As a result, the NYA is honored, Core remains the keeper of the codebase, and we buy a little time to get segwit and LN widely adopted.
2X has to happen eventually. For the good of the bitcoin community as a whole, let's do it now.

The source paper, from early 2016, concludes: "The block size should not exceed 4MB, given today’s 10 min. average block interval (or a reduction in block-interval time)."
Then later: "According to Decker, a comparison of block propagation times between now and one year ago show that a 3 megabyte block today has an equivalent propagation time of a 1 megabyte block from one year ago."
What he most definitely does not say is that 1MB blocks are dangerously large.

My point is, if the Core team were willing to embrace 2X now, there would be no network split and no change in the development team. It is their refusal to consider 2X that puts them at risk of losing control of the codebase. They are a very talented team, but they are also humans with feelings like everyone else. It seems to me that their opposition to the NYA is not technical, but emotional.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:39:24
Clearly not, because Core still controls the official repos. A hard fork without replay protection -- if successful -- replaces the dev team.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:53:26
You're correct, Core has no obligation to support 2X. But they do have an opportunity to reconcile with NYA folks and heal this great division that has burdened our community for so long. They absolutely have the option to dig in their heels and refuse to compromise. However, I believe their opposition to 2X is more ideological than technological, and their "no compromise" attitude will ultimately lead to their loss of authority in the community. In a world of differing viewpoints, our only real options are compromise or war.

I have been in the community since 2011, and I have never heard anyone claim that 1MB blocks are dangerously large... with possible the exception of Luke. While I do greatly respect his opinion, I do not believe he represents the majority on this issue.

re: blocks are only half full:
You're just wrong on this one. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:26:13
The lack of replay protection is deliberate. But is it accurate to describe it as "hostile"? If a substantial majority of the community -- including miners, business owners, and users -- want 2X, it's not a hostile takeover.
Unfortunately, we are now in a position where both the 2X and No2X camps claim to represent a supermajority of users. Obviously, they can't both be right, but defining something like "consensus" is devilishly difficult. Both sides can point to evidence that they represent the majority by using the metrics that support their narrative.
It's like the old saying, "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics."
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:18:10
It's a terrible idea. It's the worst-case outcome from 2X, in my opinion. That's why I have been encouraging Core to support 2X in the main repo. If 2X really does launch w/ 90+% hashrate support, I suspect Core will quickly do just that. Focusing their effort on a stalled chain with 100+ minute blocks will not appeal to the team very long.

I support a 2X increase but would prefer that it be created and endorsed by Core. For me, this is not about wanting an immediate block size increase. Rather, I would prefer to have the current Core team control the most widely-used codebase rather than ceding control to BTC1.
I suppose it's possible that Core could wait and see what happens in November. If the NYA goes forward and captures 90+% of hashrate, leaving the old 1X chain stagnant and dying, Core could quickly release a 2X version and get back in the game.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:23:56

Right on! I have been saying the same, and getting the same sorts of replies - it's an attack, lack of replay protection is irresponsible, etc. The No2X people struggle to see 2X as an upgrade to the existing chain instead of a new parallel chain. That difference in perspective leads to all kinds of misunderstanding and argument.
An example. When Apple releases a new iPhone, they stop selling the older model. Is that because they now think the old model is crap? Do they hate your freedom to buy the model you want? Of course not. Apple wants their iPhone brand to embody leading-edge tech, and that means removing the old products from the market as they get outdated.

I see two options here:
1. Wright wanted those subsidies and was capable of faking the tech expenditures needed to qualify for them, but he needed a plausible explanation for the source of the funds. So he claimed to be SN and pretended to set up a trust in  Seychelles where he knew the document couldn't be verified.
2. Wright actually is Satoshi and did set up the trust, but he lost control of it when Kleinman died. Now he has to convince the ATO that the funds are real (to avoid fraud charges) but he can't access them to provide proof via key signature. So he has to fabricate evidence to prove what is actually true. That's why he was able to convince Gavin but not provide a real signed message.

They plan to make money from third-party service providers integrated into the wallet, not from end-users.
For example, Coinapult integrates their service w/ Mycelium.  Users pay Coinapult a fee for each transaction using their service (Coinapult Locks). Coinapult pays Mycelium a portion of the fee in exchange for the wallet integration, which increases Coinapults's visibility and simplifies the use of their service.

I suspect those signing up with bitcoin payment will be new customers rather than people converting from credit card payment. Why? Because a large segment of bitcoin buyers will be people who consume porn (all men) but don't want to explain porn site credit card charges to a spouse or family member (lots of men).

Good point. Next time I will consider my ideas a bit more thoroughly before hitting "post".
Thanks for your ongoing contribution to the community!

Unfortunately, as long as it's possible to make money when bitcoin declines (via short selling) there will always be trolls attempting to push the market down.
Some people will happily sell their own future for a quick buck.

Silbert said all the core devs were invited, but none chose to attend.
Luke said he never received an invite. Not sure about the others.

Bitcoin needs to provide a reliable infrastructure for layer 2 solutions. Right now, segwit is our best option to get it. Without segwit, Bitcoin has a very limited future. We as a community need to get segwit in place by whatever means necessary. If SegWit2X is the best path to make that happen without a contentious chain split, so be it. Let's get it done.
We need to get away from this good vs. evil mindset. Bitcoin is not a religion. Nothing is sacred. Nobody "deserves" to be in control and call the shots.

High fees motivate exchanges to take a side on the scaling debate and actively advocate for their preferred solution. That's a good thing. It may be painful in the short term, but sometimes it's needed before meaningful change can occur. It happens in politics all the time.

The last I heard, all the crowdsale money was converted to fiat immediately after the crowdsale, and the cash has already been spent. None of the improvements that the crowdsale was supposed to fund -- total rewrite to a cross-platform modular architecture, in-wallet crowdsale token storage, etc. -- were ever delivered. No profits have ever been distributed, no additional crowsdsales are forthcoming, and there are no buyers for existing crowsdsale tokens at any price.

Why do people stay loyal to their favorite sports team when they're having a bad season?
I've seen Bitcoin overcome many serious obstacles since I first got involved in 2011, and I'm confident it will continue to do so.

That's barter. If we want bitcoin to be accepted as money we must expect that it will be regulated like money.

It's ironic that ordering a bitcoin miner with bitcoin leaves you without recourse when dealing with an unethical seller.
As much as I hate Paypal, I wish I had used them when I ordered my Little Single.

Back when bitcoin was $10 or less it was difficult to buy. It was way too much effort for something with such a low perceived value. That's what motivated me to mine instead.

First it was pet rocks, then Furbys, then Tickle Me Elmo, now it's bitcoin!
Harumph. Bitcoin is a craze like the telephone was a craze.

I just sent .005 BTC via SpareCoins plugin. Extremely easy and convenient! Nice work!
One suggestion: add an option to require the password each time you send bitcoin. As it works currently, it would be possible for someone walking by my computer to notice the bitcoin icon on the Chrome toolbar and empty my account if I forgot to log out.

I hate to be the voice of dissent here, but FinCen is right. If you send bitcoin to someone, and they send you different bitcoin back (along with a physical coin), that's money laundering. With no AML measures in place, it would be an easy way for a criminal to launder stolen coins.
If I sent $1000 in cash to a business, and they send me back $1000 in different bills, that's money laundering. It's illegal. Don't agree? Try to find a business without a money transmission license who will sell you cash.
The easy fix is to sell coins with an unfunded private key and instructions on how to load and check the balance.

I've been a huge fan of bitcoin ever since a friend wandered into my office in 2011 and insisted I download the standard client right then and there so he could send me a coin. My business partners have been in the "it's just a fad" camp until recently, but bitcoin is getting harder and harder to dismiss as a fad. Convoy offers a wide variety of branding and design services, and we now accept payment in bitcoin. Check out our website to see some recent projects. If you'd like to discuss a project, fill out our contact form and mention that you'd like to pay with bitcoin.
