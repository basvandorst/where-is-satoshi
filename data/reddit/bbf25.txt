Good input, thank you.
Would Walmart have something to gain at the moment if they accepted Bitcoin?

You guys are really a bunch of COCK-SUCKAS.
So finally a great bitcoin casino, and this whole community of jealous ass-faggots turns against the creator?
I thought this forsaken punk-asshole-hipster community called "Bitcoin" at least stood for itself...
who cares if the comments are fake, BitVegas deserves more publicitiy than that anyway....

this is an invalid criteria, who guarantees that e.g. carbonwallet is hosting 1:1 the github repository?
The user can however always sniff HTTP traffic to rushwallet/carbonwallet, so he could ensure that his private key isn't stolen more reliably...

the winkelvii? great

good question!
If it even is the right option... I would suggest to get standards, approvals, and so forth (saw some topics at bitcointalk to have bitcoin standardized as a "real" currency..)

this sounds too hipster for me to take it seriously.

Well, it's not yet clear how government regulation would look like, right? I think the Bitcoin community is afraid that it will be against Bitcoin itself (e.g. bring centralization, remove anonymity, etc.). But maybe it won't even be that way.
But actually, what for do you need 100% anonymity (you don't even have it at the moment by the way)?
Maybe you could still have some sort of alt-coin that is really 100% anonymous, in case you still want/need it.
Also, investors cannot justify their business model on Option C).. this is at least a short-term problem.

What has tax todo with Bitcoin?
If you hold Bitcoin, then you hold an asset (like Gold). So it should be taxed as any other capital gain.
Now, the problem is that tax-evasion could be very easy due to bitcoins anonymity, is this what you are referring to OP?
It's same like you go out in the park and dig for gold on weekends.
Imho it has nothing directly to do with Bitcoin itself.
