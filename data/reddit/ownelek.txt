I believe you havent read it at all. It was Satoshi idea, what you provided is a bugfix to this monetary supply, which by code, wasnt infinite. Just someone as a mockery wrote it as a BIP (or maybe because thats the procedure? idk)

Even if your smartphone is not connected to internet it still can be vulnerable to getting hacked, *especially* old smartphones, which have outdated OS. In Android there used to be a vulnerability, where simply being in range of attacker's wifi network was enough to get hacked.
So yes, Trezor, or literally any hardware wallet is definitely more safe.

What a BS. Market cap does not represent "money invested".

Yes thats probably the main bottleneck. Write speed for external hdd is a LOT slower than on normal hdd.

Volume on exchanges is not the same thing as transaction volume on blockchain.
While Segwit definitely helped reduce fees, still not all wallets and exchanges use Segwit, and still scaling on Bitcoin is not good for common use.
I think we can still expect higher fees in future, when people will start using network more. Especially I think when alts starts rising, people will start transferring Bitcoins between exchanges, since most alts are traded to Bitcoin not USD.
