I'm Brazilian and I've always saved money since my first job, and I'm in that statistic, I've never purchased bonds because I'm morally opposed to it, and I've never purchased Brazilian stocks because I don't trust the companies, Brazil is a fucked up country and bitcoin is actually getting more trust from the people than its institutions

I think it is a mixture of both, they are using it for corruption matters and they also understand it is a good idea. However in my opinion Russia is going to back cryptocurrencies up because it hurts the dollar, and they know that their efforts with oil contracts in yuan are not going to be enough, so they can use the help from bitcoin in that front

I did say that the government having a debt and being able to use this money to invest and build things is in some cases a good thing, and I also explained WHY I'm morally opposed to it, if you think I'm wrong you should point out WHY I should NOT be morally opposed to it, and before you say it, I'm not accepting any utilitarian argument like 'because the government can do good things with this money', because as I said previously, only because something has the potential for good consequences doesn't make it right, and in right I mean moral. You said that morality has no place in investing, so I'd ask you: "would you buy shares of a company that has been proven to use slave labour if that gives you a good yield?" Because According to your reasoning there's no problem with that. 
Concerning your preoccupation with my investments, I already said that I know what I'm doing and that I'm perfectly aware of the risks involved, and that I can afford to loose 100% of the money I have in bitcoin, isn't that enough for you?

I'm not saying I don't trust any company, I'm sure you can find trustworthy ones, I just like bitcoin better, and I know what I'm doing, I know it's risky and even if it goes to zero I'm fine, I can afford to lose all the money I put into it

That's exactly what I'm saying

I'm not saying what my teachers told me, I'm saying the things I learned on my own, through books and articles and etc. I understand everything you are saying about money and investing in companies, and I believe in that as well, I just said that in general Brazilian companies are not as trustworthy as other countries' companies. In the end you still avoided the question, and I'm going to rephrase it:
"what gives the government the right to borrow money and use my labor as colateral?"

1. I'm morally opposed to bonds because you are making money out of taxation, the government is taking debt on people's behalf without their consent, and since Brazil is mostly a poor country most taxes come from consumption, which is paid by poor people, so in theory you are being paid with interest that is being taken out of poor people without their consent. And yes, I understand economics and I know governments need debt to run, and in some rare cases I can even agree that it generates good results, but that doesn't make it right.
2. I didn't say you can't make money on the Brazilian stock market, I'm just saying that people have an overall distrust of it and the main companies (which are state run, or the state owns a large portion of)
The overall lesson is that the decentralised "institution" of bitcoin, is appealing more to the Brazilian public compared to the old centealized institutions that have failed the population time and time again

The problem is that after those events the dollar became a debt based currency, and it is unsustainable. The inflation and the debt has to keep growing for the system itself to continue, making the economy more sensitive with time and the boom and bust cycles become worse and worse. And about the purchasing power, it is actually going down, because the salaries rise, but the prices rises even faster.

It doesn't work like that, there are lots of keynesyans that do it for free. They simply don't like the idea of government not being able to control the currency supply, and according to their theory it is going to cause economic problems. Don't simply hate the enemy, understand him.
