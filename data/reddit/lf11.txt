It doesn't matter if the rich hold the wealth because it just accelerates the deflationary nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-05 11:43:30
You aren't looking at the big picture.  Imagine a seller offering you the option to pay in Bitcoin or some other blockchain.  Bitcoin, you gotta wait while the transaction confirms.  Doge (for example), gets confirmed nearly instantly and you are done.  At the end of the day, the merchant makes a single bitcoin transaction to move the altcoin sum to bitcoin while closing out the register.
(Don't tell me market variability makes this impractical.  If this functionality becomes necessary, exchanges will allow merchants to "lock in" exchange rates for the end of the day for POS transactions.  Sortof like tiny futures contracts if you will.)
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:01:44
People will be switching away from Bitcoin long before that happens, because you'll have bottlenecks during rush times that make it unattractive.  On the flip side, that means there are enough people using Bitcoin for there to actually be 180 purchases every  minute ... which would frankly be a fucking awesome problem to have.
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:44:05
Of course.  Again, if bitcoin transaction times become a bottleneck then this becomes a matter of course.
@_date: 2016-04-05 02:03:35
Are  there any altcoins that do *not* enjoy easy and fast exchange with Bitcoin?  It is misleading to discuss only the transaction capacity of Bitcoin.  In reality, you need to consider the transaction capacity of all blockchains that can be readily exchanged for bitcoin.  Because, frankly, once you have the infrastructure to accept bitcoin, accepting doge or any other blockchain is comparatively trivial.
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:41:01
I don't think you quite understand how capacity works.  Transaction capacity means you have to wait until the next block...or the next...or the next.  So your transaction time goes up by quite a bit.  Of course, the transaction might time out altogether, or you could increase the miner's fee so as to make it more attractive to include your transaction.
The "capacity" question is solved by increasing miner's fees.
Dust and low-amount transactions can be shunted to different blockchains.  This increases awareness and dependence on altcoins which has the added benefit of reducing overall reliance on Bitcoin in case it falters for any of a wide variety of reasons.
@_date: 2016-04-06 22:39:16
And that will be a good thing.  Keep bitcoin for the settlement backbone, use other altcoins for daily life.  If people routinely use 2-3 cryptocurrencies, that makes everything more resilient.
@_date: 2016-04-07 09:47:45
My whole point from the start is that this "transaction capacity" that people are so excited about is simply a non-issue.  If bitcoin's transaction capacity is expanded, then it is a non-issue.  If bitcoin's transaction capacity is *not* expanded, then *when the time is right* people will find other altcoins that can absorb the excess capacity and the problem will be a non-issue.
With that said, there is no plausible real-world difference between "Cash System" and "Settlement System."
Philosophy is a great tool to help understand reality, but when we try to make the real world conform to philosophical ideals, problems happen.  Philosophy is a tool to help our brains.  It is not a shovel to fix the world.

Um, I don't quite know how to say this but ... no?
If your tuition is (for example) $60,000 per year, that's $30k per semester.  If you take 2 classes in a semester, you're paying $15k per class.  If you take 6 classes, you're paying $5k/class.
It's also more than $200/day.  Another way to think about it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:19:07
It's a fair question.  I'll try to illustrate with an example.  Let's say you are really fortunate bought 3.5 bitcoins a couple years ago for $50 because your nerd friend recommended.  Now, your net bitcoin worth is almost $30,000.  Those 3.5 bitcoins are essentially nonreplaceable.  Furthermore, if they continue to gain value, you might be looking at $300,000 in a couple of years, maybe a few million by the time you retire.
It's Christmas season.  Everyone is buying gifts, usually cheap Chinese crap that ends up in the landfill in a couple of years.  Would you spend any of your bitcoin on a FitBit for your mom?  That's less than 0.02 bitcoin, but if that bitcoin has a reasonable shot of becoming worth thousands of dollars in a few years, why would you spend it now on something that will end up in a landfill?
Better to spend it on something that will last, or even gift the bitcoin directly if she understands the value of it.
If you are paying for things with bitcoin, generally speaking you'll only want to part with bitcoin for a couple of well-defined reasons:
1. Basic necessities of life
2. Life/death emergencies
3. Things that last or are repairable indefinitely.  Example: you could buy a car with your bitcoin right now, but why would you when the car would be worth just a couple thousand dollars in a few years?  Better to repair your current car or commute by bicycle for as long as possible, then spend as little as possible on a car you can actually maintain yourself so you don't have to spend much bitcoin.
4. Things that increase in value over time, like investments, land, growing your own food, stuff like that. 
Obviously, this is predicated on an economy that actually runs at least partially on bitcoin.  This does not exist yet.  However, once people realize that getting paid in bitcoin is FAR more preferable (long term) than any salary or wages in dollars, the throwaway consumerism that dominates our society will evaporate.
Lots of people will take tremendous issue with my example and theory, but this is the general idea.  This, by the way, is why economists *hate* deflationary currency: people don't want to buy things with a currency that *increases* in value over time, leading to economic stagnation.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:29
I'd like to point out that yes this means comparative economic stagnation, but on the flip side it automatically means better conservation of resources, and a return to a DIY society (at least on a community level).  To me, this is the only way we will survive as a species, and therefore Bitcoin literally represents salvation of both us and the planet.

As a (former) software engineer with over a decade of experience, I have seen that sometimes the most straightforward-seeming fixes carry the most difficult repercussions.  You do *not* want to be dealing with rollbacks, and this particular change really cannot be rolled back.  If you fuck it up, you fuck it up bad, so it has to be done right.

Eric Raymond has been a pseudo-de-facto historian and commenter on "open source" as a phenomenon over decades.  Also Richard Stallman, but Eric Raymond is easier to read.

As you read this, remember that Google is built entirely on Linux, Microsoft runs Linux, the biggest tablet and mobile phone platform is indeed Linux, and so on.  Eric Raymond's discussion is focused on Linux, and it was written in 1997, a year before Google was even founded.  So the historical context is sortof interesting.

However -- especially with the likes of Bisq -- Bitcoin itself represents a free market.  There is no centralization of control, nor any regulatory oversight or rules.

Frankly, if that happens, you can probably write off the decrease as a giant loss and end up paying nothing.  I am not a tax attorney so I can't answer this authoritatively.
I do know that sales tax is collected at the time of sale, so a prudent seller will convert at least the sales tax amount to fiat for later payment to the government.  In this scenario, no volatility risk is presented to the buyer, seller, or government.


That's not how legal tender works.  Governments certainly can accept bitcoin or anything else.  Legal tender simply means that you MUST accept that article as payment for debts.  Legal tender laws do not forbid anyone -- including the government -- from accepting other means of payment.

It is my personal experience traveling in Mexico, the UK, Ireland, southern Europe, and Romania.  It appears to be a fairly universal behavior shared by a (some? a tiny minority of?) American youth travelers across a broad range of destinations.  It also seems to be specific to Americans, as I did not observe other cultural groups engaging in that activity.
For what it's worth, I am American and have been to college.  This behavior appears similar to the stereotypical 'frat boy' behavior among a few fraternities, so it is probably nothing more than that.  However, nobody else does it and it definitely gives young American tourists a pretty terrible reputation, at least in the budget/backpacking/hostelling circles.

You are absolutely correct, but customs (and their search dogs) are looking for money (paper cash) and drugs, not silver.  Obviously there are many ways to carry value (Amex Travelers' Cheques, etc) and I certainly carried USD because it is nearly a universal currency.  However, I also carried a small amount of commodity currency as a last resort.
Also, I have been to two places where USD was not usable.  Many merchants in Romania had no interest in taking US currency (although a few did).  Similarly, many parts of Sicily were fairly hostile to the presentation of US currency.  I don't know where or when you traveled, but the USD is not quite as universally accepted as your experience might indicate.

@_date: 2014-01-08 20:41:34
Wow, you totally missed the whole point.  You assume the 1MB limit is a blunder.  It is not.  I can illustrate this very simply with a short question, "What happens if there is no block size limit?"
If there were no block size limit, then there is no incentive to increase transaction fees.  Right now, mining depends on new block allocations.
In late 2016, block rewards will drop by half.  Additionally, mining difficulty is increasing by enormous amounts constantly.  This means mining is less and less profitable.  Unless something comes along to make bitcoin more profitable to mine, there will be a huge consolidation and crash of bitcoin mining operations.  This will almost certainly result in a permanent crash of bitcoin as too few miners continue mining in the face of vast floods of new transactions.
The block size means if you want your transaction processed quickly, you will have to attach a fee.  This means miners get paid for continuing to process new transactions, even as difficulty continues to climb and rewards continue to drop.
**The 1MB block limit is a solution, not a problem.**
Incidentally, your examples are flawed.
Once a vendor accepts bitcoin, they already have the infrastructure and business mechanisms worked out for cryptocurrencies.  It is a lot easier to accept an additional cryptocurrency than to start accepting just one.  For example: consider merchandise returns.  Once you figure out how to process returns for bitcoins, the same mechanism works for altcoins.
Your IPv6 example is flawed because a bitcoin protocol change does not require a hardware change.  The reason IPv6 has been progressing so slowly is because it requires a complete hardware overhaul.  Now, switching to QuarkCoin might be comparable, since the hashing algorithm is different and you can't use Bitcoin ASICs to mine QuarkCoin (so I've heard).

Why not just accept bitcoin?  If you want to truly avoid using a bank account, I think that is the only answer in the U.S.

One of the things I like about Bitcoin is that there seems to be room at the table for the communists, the capitalists, the anarchists, and the statists.  Governments can collect taxes in a bitcoin economy; see the IRS rules.  Want a communal society?  No problem, set it up anywhere and use bitcoin to take advantage of the global economy.  Love capitalism?  There are any number of markets to sell your goods, even to those communist societies.
With that said, I find myself coming to the Bitcoin forum less and less.  The fanboi-ism has begun to grate on me, and people are taking things way way way the fuck too seriously.  As disconcerting as it is, I'm almost more excited about Dogecoin these days...at least they are trying hard not to take it too seriously.
As for rewarding the wealthy, I agree that the fiat system used to be different.  Now, it clearly rewards those at the top by taking from those at the bottom.  A sort of reverse Robin Hood, if you will.  You and I have very different opinions as to why that is the case and what to do about it, but I think we can both agree it is a serious problem.
Is bitcoin better?  I honestly don't know.  I think the distribution is more fair at the moment, and there are no bitcoin taxes to accumulate bitcoin towards the 1%.  Bitcoin isn't legal tender, so taxes can only be paid in fiat.  This removes bitcoin from your hands but does not concentrate it in the hands of the few.
I do know that I personally feel much more empowered with bitcoin than I do with fiat.  Perhaps it will end up just being a novelty, but I appreciate the alternative to the institution of Big Banking that has so clearly and evidently brought great destruction to our country.  Frankly, at the end of the day, I like being able to take my excess savings at the end of the month and move it out of their hands and keep it in my hands.
Does that make big bitcoin holders wealthy?  Yes.  I excuse that because they are mostly nerds -- like me -- and having grown up with science fiction and computer games, are possibly more objective about right and wrong than the average politician.
Thanks for the courteous reply.

OK, you are being a bit disingenious here.
First, I can buy several kinds of oil already using BTC -&gt; Gyft, but that's probably not the oil you are talking about.
I cannot personally at this point buy gasoline with bitcoin, but several gas stations in the US are already accepting bitcoin.  This partially destroys your argument.  We will see if the trend of selling gasoline for bitcoin spreads.
I don't see OPEC selling oil for bitcoin.  Yet the Council on Foreign Relations (jokingly) entertained the idea of bitcoin as a reserve currency to replace the dollar.  There was no question, "what's bitcoin?"  They understood the joke perfectly.
Is it a joke?
On a bigger scale, we don't want oil to be sold for bitcoin.  Why would you buy a nonrenewable single-use energy source with a deflationary currency?  It doesn't make sense.  You are better off saving, and spending as little bitcoin as possible for this kind of energy.  Bitcoin is better for renewable or multi-use forms of energy.  This will become obvious as more people start to use bitcoin for day-to-day transactions.

Well, I see your opinion and I respect it, but I think you are missing something very important.
Now, all the rest of the world has guns as well.  I personally believe that an armed, anarchic society is perfectly capable of holding its own against territorial encroachment.
Now there are  LOT of people that disagree with me, and I presume that you would also disagree with me.  The general idea is that unregulated militia cannot stand against modern military training and equipment.  However, this is easily disproven by the many successful guerrilla campaigns against modern militaries (Afghanistan is returning to the Taliban as we withdraw, for example).  And there has never been a military campaign against a well-armed populace, to the best of my knowledge.
So if you disagree, I respectfully ask that you do try to use some historical examples and perhaps logic and/or creativity instead of "we couldn't possibly win".....?

I gotcha.
I really think that if the banking system (US in particular, but world in general) actually listened to their customers and reduced fees, increased usability, implemented easier and safer payment systems, stopped penalizing merchants for chargebacks, and catered more to low-income / at-risk clients, that bitcoin would never find a foothold.
As it is, the US system is so bad that bitcoin is obviously better for many people.  (Lots of trolls here on reddit disagree with this, but reality doesn't agree with them.)
For example, I just paid for 3 domain renewals with bitcoin.  I selected "bitcoin" as payment, and they presented a QR code.  I pointed my phone at it, *CLICK*, confirmed the amount, and that was it.  No address entry, no typing long numbers, no CVV code, no waiting for the charge to go through.  Just point, click, done.  Amazing.  And the best part is, if I want to send coin to my partner a long way away, she can just bring up a QR code on her phone, hold it up to a webcam, and I send bitcoin just as easily.
This is perfectly possible with the regular banking system, but they haven't done it.  Thus the door is open for bitcoin.

I haven't tried to get any of those but I have purchased several varieties of antibiotics and I know there's a whole rack of statins and various classes of psych meds that are readily available.  Even some chemotherapy drugs.  I wouldn't take any of them without knowing the hell I'm doing, but many of the treatment protocols are available online (which is where the doctors go anyway so w/ever).  If you are actually curious, set up an account and log in and look for yourself.  There are plenty of people selling thousands of different prescription medications, in as much quantity as you want.
Last I checked, doxycycline was between $1-1.30 per 100mg pill.  That's not a great price if you can get a generic brand fill, but I purchased it when there was a doxy shortage and it was looking to cost over $200 for a 10-day supply and my insurance plan has a high deductible.  No thanks.
I'm perfectly comfortable with a 4-5 year timeline.  Personally I think it will be rather sooner than that.  There are a few doctors already accepting bitcoin and the number is growing.  But for the sake of your skepticism, I'll grant a couple more years.
You are correct that healthcare is a huge industry with enormous costs and gigantic structure, and the thought of reforming that is mind-boggling.  Actually, it's impossible.  The beautiful thing about bitcoin is that it will route around all that crap.  Medicine doesn't have to be complicated.
I know you don't believe this is even remotely possible, but I certainly do not have to convince you.  It'll happen regardless of our discussion.

Not necessarily.   It depends how willingly his customers switch to a different payment form.

You may be (probably are!) correct, but the squabbling about how that portfolio of values is assembled will be monumental.
I hope the next reserve currency will arise out of individual people using it, rather than imposed from above.  Perhaps it will be bitcoin, perhaps dogecoin, perhaps something else.
In the end, you are almost certainly correct because we'll probably end up with an array of valuation systems used for different purposes by different people at different times.

This is the dollar:   Bitcoin looks nothing at all like this, and I cannot foresee a plausible future in which it becomes like that.  
You forgot about decentralization and deflation.  The point of bitcoin is not to hide wealth nor to be anonymous, although those are things some people can use it for.  No, bitcoin is something else entirely.
Bitcoin is a social experiment in anarchy.  Anarchic and pseudo-anarchic economic models have been discussed for generations, without anyone giving them a serious try.  Bitcoin is a test of some of those theories.
Scared yet?  I am.
Edit: "decentralization" means no issuing authority.  The vision for bitcoin has always been that mining would become consolidated into the realm of Big Iron.  If I am wrong, please correct me.  The point is that there is no central authority issuing/destroying currency and toying with the value of it, although mining would become largely consolidated because of power use efficiency if nothing else.

So the solution is to set up an exchange where it is impossible for one person -- or even a group of people -- to make off with everyone's money.  This is difficult but not impossible.  Once this can be done, who would ever use an exchange that didn't offer this kind of protection?

No, you don't have to renegotiate.  Please allow me a moment to explain.
When you are trying to send money across borders, you are often charged significant fees AND have to take a poor conversion.  The fiat-&gt;bitcoin + bitcoin-&gt;fiat conversion fees in different countries are easily less than the transmission + fiat/fiat conversion costs of sending money directly.  And if one of the parties doesn't need to convert to or from bitcoin, it gets even better.
The original contract can be negotiated on the regular fiat/fiat exchange rate per time of payment.  The business is not exposed to volatility, and the client is not exposed to volatility.  Both benefit from reduced fees and near-instantaneous clearing times.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:59:51
You are not paying attention.
If a producer is working fully in Bitcoin, then fiat volatility doesn't matter.  We are still a ways off from this because energy is not purchaseable with bitcoin ... yet.
In the mean time, volatility works really well for me as a consumer because I buy bitcoin on the dips and spend it as it rises.  Indeed, volatility means my out-of-pocket cost for groceries is significantly lower using bitcoin, even after exchange fees.
And if bitcoin drops, I just pay with fiat, like normal (and buy more bitcoin, like I mentioned).  No problem at all.
For sellers, volatility is a little riskier...unless they are using bitpay.  However, once they start buying things with bitcoin as well, then they will likely find it worthwhile to retain some percentage of transactions in bitcoin in order to avoid double exchange fees.
Again, if bitcoin becomes adopted universally, then btc/fiat volatility won't matter.  Btc/fiat volatility only matters if you are exchanging bitcoin for fiat.

Yeah if you look at the log chart, there is a pretty regular bump every 8 months.  It might not qualify as a "bubble" but it is definitely there.  The last two bumps have been bubbles, though.  Furthermore, it has been adding a zero on a yearly basis.  Looking at the chart, 10K is quite reasonable by the end of 2014, but emotionally I am completely unprepared for that and I do not think it is possible.
Of course, I have felt this way since $30, and I thought that was an exorbitant price.

And that is a classic mistake.  You can be a creationist and believe firmly in evolution.  I'm not talking about this "Intelligent Design" bullshit, that's a bunch of bullcrap and even the Catholic Church thinks so.
Anyone who has personally experienced spirituality can say with absolute certainty that evolution may explain everything we see in the biological world, but something else exists.
Logic holds that evolution is how the world works.  For some of us, personal experience shows that something else exists.  That doesn't invalidate any part of evolution whatsoever, it just means science hasn't figured everything out yet.

Hey, I replied to your other comment.
Cash is a hassle.  Bank accounts are a hassle that charge lots of annoying fees and are closed during the hours I'm not working.  Carrying a credit card is not a hassle *per se* but the wallet is annoying as fuck if you like wearing clothes that actually fit your body.
And yes, getting paid in bitcoin does cost money, but does it cost less than credit card finance charges and bank account fees?  If you are exceedingly wise with money, you can avoid most of these charges, but it is getting hard.  I use mint.com to track my finances, and I have hundreds of dollars of fees and charges purely related to the administration of my accounts and minor interest charges.  Bitcoin fees are, well, less.


Not really, not in the US.  My phone has NFC but it has never worked for some reason.  And most terminals don't support it.  Of course most terminals don't support bitcoin either, but quite a few *do* support Gyft and therefore bitcoin by proxy.  Additionally, NFC appears pretty much dead in the water but bitcoin is growing fast.

Exponential growth curves are never sustainable.  The question is, when do they end, and what happens afterwards?  Does it go logarithmic and become sigmoidal?  Or does it crash?
New technologies such as computers and cars tend to go sigmoidal, but tulips crash.  Which one is bitcoin?  And when do we find out?
Personally, I think the idea of a blockchain is new technology, and bitcoin is riding that wave pretty strongly.  It may not be the Blockchain to Rule Them All in the end, but I don't think we are looking at a tulip situation for a while yet.  Despite the occasional tulip-like manias.

OK now I'm going to go out on a limb and grant you that your argument be completely correct and valid in every way.
Now I invite you to switch disciplines.  Put on a different hat.  Say, ecology.
Is this not what the earth needs?  For humans to cease their consumption and revert to the minimum consumption possible?  Do we have any other choice but extinction as the earth's ecological webs collapse?  I'm not talking about global warming but rather ocean acidification and trophic collapse.  We must adopt a civilization that places reduction of resource consumption as the primary priority, or we will continue consuming until there is not enough to survive.
Doesn't Bitcoin satisfy this need?
It is important to understand that this largely applies to nonrenewable resource consumption.  Consumption of renewable resources means you spend bitcoin once, but reap the benefit multiple times.  Isn't this exactly what humans need to achieve in order to survive (and preserve as much of the earth's ecology as remains)?
Perhaps you think this means a return to medieval feudalism.  It doesn't, but even if it did, what is the alternative?

I think it is very interesting to see the effect on people's political and economic views.  This, in my opinion, reflects on the true nature of bitcoin.

This implies that the eventual effect of bitcoin may affect our culture far beyond supplanting or augmenting the means of exchange.

Runs definitely happen, and they look like what you saw.  They tend to happen in other countries because most Americans feel secure in their banking system.
But don't think for a moment that runs don't happen.  Sovereign Bank was the most recent serious bank run in U.S. that I'm aware of.  They lost several billion dollars in withdrawals in a single weekend over rumors, and were quickly snapped up for a bargain by Santander.  
It was an orderly bank run, but a run nevertheless.  Had they not been bought by Santander, they would have likely been forced to close.

This is true, but right now, especially with the new IRS rules, it can be quite beneficial to sell some at a loss in order to absorb some of the tax liability.  This can end up with a net profit if you include a third instrument with reasonable liquidity to both fiat and bitcoin.  I.e. you take a huge loss in bitcoin, but also buy dogecoin in a separate transaction.  In other words, if you are trading the ratio between two non-dollar instruments, you can post a huge loss in one of those instruments in dollar terms without actually absorbing a net worth loss.
I'll bet this doesn't make any sense to you.  Sorry!  Maybe someone else can explain it better than me.

I do.  Volatility means I get more goods for less fiat.  Win.


Of course you do, and you should.  There are certain times when it is good to go into debt, and there are other times that it is good to not have debt.  Any prudent person should pay attention to the current state of their currency before making financial decisions of any size.  If volatility is high, that factors even into smaller decisions.


Certainly!  I expect that once bitcoin starts to gain market penetration similar to any of the world's smaller currencies, its volatility will even out.  Volatility is already down considerably from a few months ago.  I will be sorry when the volatility fades, but super happy because of what it indicates.

Credit cards are primarily used as a means of electronic payment.  People do utilize the credit, but their lines of credit do not regularly increase.  Once they have started carrying a balance, their monetary outflow cannot increase past their debt limit.  Carrying a balance is thus not different from paying the balance in full every month, except for the amount you pay in fees.

Bitcoin itself is extremely stable.  What is unstable is the fiat/bitcoin exchange.
Why is this important?
Because volatility only matters if you have exposure to the fiat/bitcoin exchange.


Right now, yes.  What about in two years?
Frankly, if I can be paid in bitcoin and buy groceries and gasoline, I wouldn't personally care much about the exchange rate.  Of course a grocer like Stop&amp;Shop or Walmart is going to care.  But what about a local farmer selling at the farmers' market, who is able to buy seed and gasoline with bitcoin as well?
Yes the exchange rate will play **a** role, but that role could foreseeably have a diminishing effect going into the future.  Just like the Euro/USD exchange rate does play **a** role in the cost of our everyday items, just not much of a role.

Exactly.  This is a good thing.  Americans are waaaay overmedicated.


That is a risk you take anyway.  You trust that the FDA and the doctor have ensured that you won't die, but lots of people are permanently damaged or killed because of unexpected drug effects or interactions.  Many of these could be prevented if people did some due diligence before putting powerful chemicals inside themselves.  Of course it is the doctor's responsibility to do this but reality shows that the doctor's work is not sufficient.
As for bitcoin and PGP ... people still use bitcoin and PGP even though it is difficult to use.  Is it for everyone?  Not yet.  Of course the price of NOT using PGP is that the NSA watches everything.  This is likely going to spur some significant adoption of encryption as we move forward.  The thing is, it is convenient to use USD and plain email, but there is a serious price to that convenience.

You are exactly right in every way until the last point.
*Because that already happens, even with strict government controls and regulation!*
So at worst we are talking only about a matter of degree.
What will happen is that people will go online and read very carefully the reviews and risks that other people experience, before taking a drug.  Right now, people trust that their doctor will not mislead them and that the FDA guarantees their safety, and just take pills without researching them.  This is incredibly dangerous.
Would you pop a pill without having a pretty good idea that it is safe to do so?  Right now, you test the FDA and your doctor.  But the FDA is often fooled because companies often conceal negative or damaging studies.  And doctors are visited by big-breasted drug reps to sell the newest drugs.  People trust that system with their lives.
It hurts people and we don't need it.
Again, we are talking about a matter of degree at most.  I hold that less people will be hurt if we sidestep the FDA altogether, because patients will pay some fucking attention to the drugs they put into their body instead of blindly trusting others.

If you live in a state with a high income tax and make more than $500k (single) in taxable income, your tax rate will likely be over 50%.  
The other thing is that we know how volatile bitcoin is.  And there are quite a lot of people (including myself) who believe the future value of bitcoin is be quite a lot higher than the current price indicates.  If you are planning in retiring in 30 years, paying double for bitcoins now is probably pocket change, particularly if the current market price of bitcoin increases to match GBTC instead of GBTC decreasing.
And it should increase, there is an absolutely fantastic arbitrage opportunity right now that won't last long.

You replied to someone else.
But I will reply to this point: "Also: Anarchy can only be a step back, not forward, because we already had anarchy and collectively decided against it (many times)."
BULLSHIT.  There was absolutely zero "deciding" about moving away from anarchy.  The current system of government around the world is 100 percent without the slightest sliver of exception a phenomenon of Western European (by extension, Roman) conquest and genocide.
There are countless systems of governance with more or less centralized control.  Some of radically less centralized control.  Our own collection-of-states system of government (prior to the Civil War) was modeled after one such system: the Iroquois Seven Nations.  The Somali Xeer system of common law is still in wide use through the Horn of Africa (and don't even mention the violence in Mogadishu -- that is again purely a result of European conquest).  The Kingdom of Nri was founded on the principle of non-violence, even for criminal punishment or political expansion.  These are just a few examples of many countless non-Western systems of decentralized governance, many of which have been almost entirely destroyed by the guns of European conquerors.
We have not decided against anarchy.  It was decided for us, by foreigners with guns.  Well, now the whole world is awash with guns, and the decision will be made again, this time with the consent of those affected.

It is valid in a purely mathematical sense but humans are not strictly mathematical creatures.
Think: would you pay $10 for something that that you valued less than $10?  Generally speaking, no of course not!  When you trade that $10, you trade it for something that *you value more than the $10.*  You used to have $10, now you have something more valuable (to you) than the $10.  Your net worth has increased.
By the same token, the merchant values your $10 more than what you bought.  Before, s/he had stuff that wasn't quite that valuable to them, and now they have $10.  Their net worth (to them) has increased.
There is still only $10 in the game, but both parties to the transaction have increased their net (perceived) worth.  This is the engine that drives capitalism: the positive sum to both sides of every transaction.
Key point: capitalism is not a zero-sum game.  Money is only a tool, and only part of the equation.  You have to factor in what was traded, and you also have to factor in human emotions.

Well, you have to add up all the various taxes.
I read an article a few years ago about taxation rates in the Scandinavian countries.  They found out that when tax rates exceed somewhere around 51-52 percent, people find it no longer worthwhile to work and drop out of the workforce to suckle on government benefits.  So they reduced the taxation rates slightly to ensure that enough people would work to support the system.
It's an interesting thought.  I can't find the article now, unfortunately.

OK just replied, but even if the 1MB transaction limit remains in place (as it probably will) that does not whatsoever hinder bitcoin.  Do you even understand why the limit exists?
It exists to create scarcity in the rate of transactions.  This is necessary in order to keep mining profitable as difficulty rises and block rewards decrease.  It means transaction fees will go up.  If it becomes a problem, it just means that altcoins will go up in value for small transactions.
Totally a non-issue.  If it ever becomes an issue, the block size can be changed.
Think about it like this.  The 1MB block size limit will mark the transition from inflation to self-supporting value in order to reward mining.  This is a huge milestone and a major achievement, if we get there.

This guy knows what's up.
The purpose of bitcoin is to facilitate trust in a trust-free environment, using massed CPU power to guarantee that trust.  This, in essence, is also the purpose of government, except they use guns and police to guarantee trust.
Bitcoin needs to scale, by becoming so valuable that even if you could mount a direct attack, you'll be better off helping compute the blockchain instead.  High fees are the start of that.  The sooner we can reward miners with transaction fees instead of block rewards, the sooner we can get on with the business of replacing the institution of government-as-we-know-it.
(I'm well aware of the fact that government will never go away.  However, in a world dominated by bitcoin, government will assume a fundamentally different role.  This, I presume, is why the US Federal Government is the  holder of bitcoin on the planet.  Somebody knows what's coming.)

The first sentence of the conclusion of Satoshi's original whitepaper reads thus:


This is what it is about.  Trust.  That, by the way, is the core purpose of government: to ensure trust in an otherwise trustless world.  You can trust that pretty much everyone you meet will follow the rules because if they don't, government will punsh them and/or remove them from society.
Bitcoin replaces this central purpose of government.
I don't think government will go away *per se* but the nature of government will be very different.

That seems like an extremely reasonable position.  This has been my understanding from the start.  I confess I have not dug into the details of what has been going on, I only investigated far enough to see that this seemed to be the case, and decided to back away until either (a) cool, thoughtful heads prevailed or (b) something else happened in which case it would become quickly apparent that a different blockchain technology would end up supplanting bitcoin for the future of global trust.
From my casual perspective from afar (having witnessed lots of corporate drama in various capacities) it really seemed to me like there are a lot of people rushing to rash conclusions, and the bitcoin core developers seemed to (largely) remain perfectly competent to handle the ongoing evolution of the technology.  Unfortunately, the debate grew incredibly toxic and I couldn't afford the personal stress of getting involved even in the picayune debates on this sub.
Altcoins like Ethereum seem like a great place to develop new ideas.  I'm fucking super excited about Ethereum and have tinkered with developing some things on that altcoin.  However, there have been some absolutely disastrous problems with Ethereum (and other altcoins) which would have been catastrophic had anything like that occurred with Bitcoin.  That's what altcoins are for, and I recognize that an altcoin like Litecoin or Ethereum may end up being more suitable than Bitcoin for buying my morning coffee.  That's OK, I'm totally not worried or concerned in any way about that, in fact I feel that if there are multiple active blockchains technologies in daily use all over the world, everything will work out for the better in the long term.  After all, it's not as if exchanging value between coins is difficult.

This is simple bubble psychology.  So long as any noticeable number of people are optimistic, the slightest upwards bump will attract too many buyers, the market will be quickly overbought, and the trend will continue downwards.
Only when despair is universal, when bitcoin bumps up and nobody notices because nobody cares because everyone believes it is dead: THAT is when we will have a new bubble.  Only then will growth be slow and organic enough to form a solid footing for the next rise.

The price of being useful is reflected in the fact that Bitcoin hasn't gone down to zero, like many stocks do after they bubble.

The purpose of bitcoin is to replace this function of trust-building in an inherently trustless world.  Therefore, the purpose of bitcoin is to defeat/replace the institution of government as the sole certifier of public peace.

Lots of haters saying this.  It depends quite a bit on one's efficiency, tech background, reading comprehension, and philosophical background.
If you have a decent philosophical background and understand a bit about how crypto works, it is entirely possible to come to this conclusion inside of 2 hours.  The original white paper stands tall in this regard.  
If you know how humanity works and understand why government exists, it only takes a little bit of reading to understand what Bitcoin represents, and then the only thing that remains is to decide how much of a likely-inevitable future you want to be a part of.

It's only the same thing from a programming standpoint.
What Bitcoin brings to the table that nobody else does is being the single greatest pool of planetary computational power.  The strength of the block checksum, which guarantees trust in an otherwise untrustworthy environment, is what makes Bitcoin special and valuable.
Philosophically speaking, this replaces government.  The ostensible purpose of laws and police is to establish trust in an otherwise animalistic society.  Fast forward another couple of decades, and I think this technology may supplant the institution of government in the way that the AR-15 has made the Roman phalanx obsolete.
BCH does not offer this trust, and therefore is nothing like Bitcoin at all.  BCH cannot replace government unless it attracts the social participation and buyin that Bitcoin enjoys.  Which it has not done, and is unlikely to do in the future.

Of course, phalanx formations are still in use today, but it is a niche with fairly well-defined parameters.  Just as the horse and buggy remains in use despite the age of the automobile (and despite what anyone may say, buggy whip makers today are perfectly well compensated for their work).

There were a significant number of tech people of all ages that picked up on bitcoin early on as something one would be an idiot to pass up.  If you were technically competent enough to understand the original whitepaper, you could forecast where we are today without too much difficulty.
Or at least that the likelihood of being where we are today was greater than zero.  
In some ways, the older techies had an advantage.  They were involved in tech when public key encryption was developed and became available for widespread use.  They are used to reading the driest of dry technical papers and making sense of it, because that's what computer science is built on and that's what they cut their teeth on.  Those techies with a streak of libertarian or anarchist philosophy could tell exactly what the game was with that line in the conclusion, "We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust."

Bitcoin is taxed at the point of exchange.  If you have a lot, don't exchange a lot.  For myself, I sold a while back because I needed the money, so I'll never have much at this point.  It's sortof a moot point, but it's fun to think about.

You're only looking at part of the picture.  If I take out a loan, that loan becomes a deposit in someone's bank account.  That deposit gets loaned out, and becomes a deposit on someone elses' bank account.  This is the case for all loans: loans become capital once they are deposited.
Loans need to be paid back.  This is normally fine.  However, if something happens and someone is unable to pay back the loan, this consumes the reserve margin at the bank and -- if any significant fraction of lenders default -- quickly exceeds the value of all actual assets in the system.

You are correct, of course.  Economists are very right about this.  Yet, almost nobody thinks about what this actually means in the long run.
Take your &lt;UnpopularOpinion&gt; to the next level: **this is what the Earth needs in order for there to be resources left for our children to enjoy a safe, productive civilization.**  A currency that is so valuable that the only thing to spend it on is either (a) the bare necessities of life or (b) things you can repair indefinitely and pass down to your children or (c) things that grow on their own and increase your investment, like food forests.
It's an ugly pill to swallow, but one we must swallow if we are to survive as a species.

Yes, actually, and there are some things I disagree firmly with Mr. Peterson over.  However, my personal disagreements do not detract from the man's philosophy or positions.


I like to think so.  It is, of course, rather difficult to understand one's own biases, but it is something I work at.
For example, although I am personally an anarchist, I have enough of a functional understanding of fascism, socialism, theocracy, and capitalism to make a congruent argument for each of those (depending on the company).  Along similar lines, I understand and can argue for social justice, individual rights, collective rights, or a fascist view of human rights.
So yes, I am fairly well aware of my own bias, since I can argue against my own philosophy if I so choose.  I know the weak points, if you will, where things break down and other philosophies have perhaps better ideas.
Peterson is a stone cold liberal, old school, free speech, critical thinking, individual rights.  He is not remotely right-wing in any sense, new or old.

That may or may not be correct, you'd have to be more specific.
My original points, that Peterson is not right-wing, and that your categorization of him as such reveals your own ignorance, stand.
There are right-wingers who agree and support him, but guilt-by-association is not a feature of intelligent debate.  His philosophy is not at all right-wing, although I can see how someone might get distracted by his attention to matters of traditional religion and get the wrong idea.


The fact that you bring race into this tells me more about your personal philosophical standing than anything else, and your phrasing is that of a socialist or communist.  As such, you view anyone who is not socialist as "right-wing" and therefore Peterson is right wing.  Which is fine, but outside of your little philosophical circle, that is not a correct statement.

So this is the fallacy that Keynesian economics (and each of its cousins) is built upon.  The Paradox of Thrift.  That people saving money causes less money to be in circulation and eventually the currency will fail because nobody will have any money.
What it means is that if you have bitcoin and fiat, you'll hold bitcoin and spend fiat.  That is not the whole picture, however.  You have to look at the other side of the coin (as it were).  If you are a merchant, you don't want fiat, you want bitcoin.  You have to convince your customers to part with bitcoin.  This means offering discounts.
In bitcoin terms, this is effectively deflationary.  If you earn a steady paycheck in bitcoin, it means you get a functional raise every day because every satoshi goes a little further.  Prices drop over time.
*Is this bad?*  Keynesian economists would universally say this is horrible.  This is a deflation moving into depression, and the whole purpose of government management of currency is to prevent this from happening.
But step back.  The depressions of the modern era are due to the crash of inflation.  All the jobs and companies and finance that was built up during a period of inflation is no longer viable.  Everyone has to find new jobs, and that takes time.  A lot of time.
I invite you to consider that the long-term deflation caused by the gradual *increase in value over time* of a currency is fundamentally different.  Think: fermentation of wine.  It gets better over time.

It's probably a good safety net if you hold physical gold.  You'll find that physical gold commands a significant premium over paper gold, and physical silver commands a similar premium.  This separation between the actual physical market and the commodities market is the price of this manipulation.
The easiest argument (for me) is this: what *should* the price of gold do when there is economic trouble?  It should go *up* as investors and worried workers flock to buy gold instead of everything else.  But nowadays, you see it go *down* in price when there is trouble.  This is because gold has been turned into another just another paper instrument.
Another easy argument: look up "rehypothecation."  This is not some conspiracy theory, this is fact.  Whatever gold reserves that may exist have been promised multiple times to various entities.  If you don't hold physical gold, then "your" gold is actually owned by ... errr ... *other people.*  Several other people.
Unless you hold physical.  Then you own it.  But maybe buy with a money order under a false name and have it shipped to a drop.
Or buy bitcoin.  Bitcoin goes up when there is financial trouble.

None of the altcoins thus far have any serious traction to compete with Bitcoin, and even if we see some significant competition, the sheer weight (and limited supply) of Bitcoin means it will likely maintain its status as a backbone of cryptocurrency for a long time to come.

Because a deflationary currency becomes more valuable over time simply by holding it.


Right.  Poor people don't have money, and they can't use money to make more money because when you are poor, stock accounts and even bank accounts are simply not accessible.

That's not true at all.  Give poor people an incentive to save (i.e. make their saved money worth more if they save it) and you'll be shocked at how many people will suddenly start saving.
Inflationary currencies actively disincentivize poor people from saving.  Deflationary currencies incentivize *everyone* to save, *including poor people.*  This means money stays low in the hierarchy, accumulating slowly over time.

When the deflation happens as a result of a crash from inflation, and all the malinvestment must be shaken out of the economy, yes.  But only in that situation.

Anyone who wants to improve their economic lot, the first step is to discharge all debts as quickly as possible.

Debt denominated in bitcoin is a nauseating to even think about.  This is because we all still collect earnings in fiat currency.  There is no realistic possibility of major debt issuance in a deflationary currency, to anyone still earning money in inflationary currency.
Debt is one of the primary mechanisms that keeps poor people poor.
Remove debt and return to debit-based system, and the poor will not be subjected to this unjust system that keeps them poor.
Debt is also one of the major mechanisms by which wealthy people become more wealthy.
But are you comfortable lending bitcoin?  Probably not.  A deflationary currency has a tremendous chilling effect on debt markets.

To a certain extent, a degree of wealth inequality is inevitable, just like a degree of IQ or physical ability is inevitable.
But the gross exaggerations of inequality that heralds unrest and societal breakdown has a different cause.  This happens when *some* wealthy or politically-connected parties turn the coffers of the State into their own pockets.  This happens by many means, but the end result is that they redirect the State's power of taxation towards filling their own pockets (rather than providing services and assistance to the general public from where the money came).
**The most common way this happens in most economies is that these wealthy parties direct the products of inflation (i.e. created money) into their own pockets.**  You can see this in America with the bank bailouts, corporate welfare, and so on.
In a deflationary currency, there IS no inflationary "spigot" to collect money from.  Therefore, the most common cause of wealth inequality is cut off at the source.
As for bottom-up accumulation, it should be pretty obvious that people with a lot of bitcoin are more likely to spend some, while everyone at the bottom is buying and HODLing.  Magnify this across the bitcoin economy and it should be pretty obvious that the overall pressure will be to reduce large holders and distribute towards the bottom holders.  (Simply because of differential saving pressure.)

You've answered your own question.


Right, through mechanisms that are simply not available to lower classes.  A deflationary currency gains value simply by holding.  Anyone can hold.  Few can invest.  This is how a deflationary currency helps wealth inequality.

@_date: 2018-03-08 20:20:52


You have to look at the specific mechanisms of HOW money is used to make more money.  Then you have to consider whether those mechanisms exist (or even *can* exist) in a deflationary economy.
If you don't look at this, then your argument is simply fallacious.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:41:03
Deflationary currencies incentivize savings at all levels of the wealth curve.  This holds money closer to the bottom of the hierarchy.
Deflationary currencies also minimize the capacity to issue debt, which is one of principle ways wealth inequality is increased.

Rich people don't store their wealth in savings accounts.  It goes in stocks and other investments that earn more money.  This is why rich people save: they have access to systems that allow them to increase their personal worth.


If you don't have access to investment systems capable of AT LEAST equaling inflation, there is absolutely no incentive to save (aside from a "rainy day" fund....which gets progressively worth less as time passes).  In fact, inflationary currency is a DISINCENTIVE to save.  
So, poor people are directly disincentivized to save in an inflationary economy.  Don't think the &lt;$500 in savings is a reflection on the *capacity* to save, it is simply a response to incentives.

I've never seen anyone suggest that circumstances of birth do not influence the amount of money someone has, right from the start.  Nobody is born with currency, but children of wealthy families are born with significantly higher access to money.  Same thing.


The difference is that with a deflationary currency, *the poor are also rewarded for hoarding wealth.*  Why is this such a hard concept to grasp?
An inflationary currency only rewards wealthy people for holding, because they have access to investments and other machinery for accumulating wealth.
A deflationary currency ALSO rewards poor people for holding, because all they have to do is hodl.  They don't need access to banking or investment accounts in order to be rewarded for holding.
Don't forget, poor people have a much greater incentive to hodl, because the stakes are higher.  Saving the equivalent of a cup of coffee (of a deflationary currency) means a lot to the poor, but it means nothing at all to the wealthy.  This is why deflationary currencies influence wealth movement downwards.

For world domination and eventual collapse of the institution of centralized government as we know it today?  Bitcoin is so far ahead as to be the only horse in the race in my opinion.
However, I am not unsympathetic to the realities that someone may figure out how to do things better.  The best idea or technology is not always (or even often) the one that wins.  Of the coins now in use, I don't think any are serious contenders.  With that said, there are some good ideas  that have a hell of a lot of potential.
Ethereum comes to mind.  The expanding functionality inherent in their rapidly-progressing scripting and contract system may eventually serve as serious competition for bitcoin in market share.  They may end up just cornering many areas that bitcoin simply never manages to cover, but there will always be overlap.  
When someone manages to figure out how to store private keys as well as public keys on the blockchain without relying on external services, that will mark a major generational advance in blockchain technology.  I don't think it would make bitcoin obsolete *per se* but it could be another horse in the race.
I'm also not too proud to admit that BCH might end up being a long-term winner.  It certainly didn't die instantly like I thought it would.  Perhaps the value is only in the brand, but on the other hand it is still stabilizing and it might end up being more of a player than most of us think.  This is very unlikely in my opinion but I'll admit the possibility.
One serious problem that will Bitcoin will eventually face is quantum computing.  The algorithm is theoretically quantum-resistant.  However, cryptography is an evolving field and it is really only a matter of time.  Bitcoin will need to either become quantum secure or be beat by a quantum-secure chain.
Just my opinions.  Worth nothing, as I know nothing, and my opinion has no value.

Bitcoin is inherently anarchic in nature.  As such, it is most similar to natural systems composed of living things.  Natural systems develop order from chaos, i.e. natural systems are inherently negentropic.  At the same time, natural systems are ruthless in seeking efficiency.
A group of CEOs ordering anything after a private meeting is practically a textbook definition of inefficiency, and will be discarded (unless the decision is, in fact, an improvement in efficiency in which case everyone will benefit).
Curiously, it appears that increasing block size is not necessarily an increase in efficiency.  If you only look at transaction times, yes, but when you look at the system as a whole, clearly not.

What's wrong is that's not how private fireworks shows are funded.  Private fireworks are usually a matter of advertising.  For example, some friends of mine go to a speedway around major holidays.  They have demolition derbies, exhibitions, and fireworks.  The fireworks are an advertisement for the speedway, and are paid for with the price of the tickets.
That's just one example.  Fireworks shows by themselves are generally not profitable.  However, fireworks as a value-added show or as an advertisement can be quite valuable.
However, if you live in an area with a lot of municipal fireworks displays, then private shows aren't all that valuable.  Most companies can't compete with a regular schedule of city fireworks.

I'd suggest that if the blocks do not grow in size, storage space will remain a non-issue indefinitely, and transaction fees will rise to cover the lowering bitcoin block reward over time.
Here's the thing: if you raise the block size, then transaction fees go down.  If transaction fees go down, then it is less lucrative to mine bitcoin.  If it is less lucrative to mine bitcoin, then the bitcoin reward needs to be increased.  If the bitcoin reward is increased, then bitcoin switches from deflationary to inflationary and the whole game is fucked because the *whole point* of bitcoin is to have a deflationary, anarchic currency system backed by an ever-escalating distributed computation to certify the cryptographic ledger that becomes *more valuable* over time.
Bitcoin is artificial scarcity.  Resource exhaustion, designed to outpace real-world resource exhaustion.  Because if bitcoin becomes more valuable than exploiting resources, we might actually have a world left for our grandchildren.

Inflation is increase of supply, deflation is decrease of supply.
The increasing price of bitcoin is partially due to demand, but it is also due to the fact that the USD (and pretty much all fiat currencies) is inflating (and therefore diluting in value) much faster than Bitcoin.  This is why the price of groceries, gas, rent, health care, and literally every asset is going up when priced in USD.
The injection of value into Bitcoin is not inflationary because it does not result in more Bitcoin being created.  If anything, it increases the velocity (and thus functional inflation) of the US dollar as people move value from USD to Bitcoin.  However, this effect is so small (as compared to the total supply of USD) that it is only theoretical at this point.

This is exactly the mentality that led to surgeries *not* being tested.  It is wrong.
Outcomes most definitely do need to be tested.  Some of the surgeries that have been tested have been shown to have no positive outcome or even a negative outcome over doing nothing at all.  One of the first examples of this was prostate screening, and prostate surgery for prostate cancer.  It turns out that people survive better and longer if you do *not* operate in most cases.
A more recent example involves certain kinds of knee surgery.  No long term benefits over sham surgery.  There are many examples.
**Surgeries absolutely need to be tested.  Assuming they work because they are self-evident is unscientific thinking and no better than any other form of faith-based medicine.**  Congratulations!  You have faith in the surgical method.  Faith without science.


There are many forms of medicine other than "western" medicine, and as for poking needles ... you'd be surprised how many medical schools teach accupuncture, and widely it used.

So close, but still so far!  The advantage of having a full genomic database of as many people as possible is that you can find "people of interest" very quickly once you collect crime scene DNA.

The problem is that you have no idea what the future holds.  We don't know how to map "terrorist proclivities" from the genome right now, but that doesn't mean it won't be done in the future.

It's one of the things T-bills are for.  The government issues T-bills and banks give money in exchange.  A T-bills is roughly akin to your mortgage note: a promise to repay in the future.  War is like a natural disaster.  If a tornado blows your house down then you have to take out a mortgage to rebuild, and the bank makes a profit.  If there is no reason to rebuild, then you do not take out a mortgage and the bank makes no money.
If there is no war, there is no reason to issue T-bills and the banks don't make money off sovereign debt.  But if war can be instigated, then both sides need to raise revenue and debt is the preferred instrument.

You are forgetting that land ownership != ability to pay taxes.  In my area, there are a lot of elderly people who have been living on the same land for &gt;50 years.  Meanwhile, there have been tremendous booms in urbanization, gentrification, and so on.  Property values have skyrocketed, but there remain large numbers of people on fixed incomes or with minimal work income.
Land taxes benefit the wealthy, and strip the poor of their land.  The ultimate FUCK YOU tax, likely second only to inheritance taxes for destroying the ability of poor and low-middle-class families to accumulate wealth.

Frankly, most of the people publicly "questioning" Bitcoin were (and are) people who seem to have a vested (or least emotional) interest in its utter failure.  They focus not its questionably meteoric rise, but rather on its "certain" demise.  Furthermore, their complaints are rarely on the many actual weaknesses of bitcoin, but rather they harp on popular misconceptions and long-resolved issues.
Anybody who actually spent a little bit of time learning about blockchain technology can see that this shit has serious potential.  Whether bitcoin's blockchain becomes the One Chain or whether someone comes up with a better blockchain, the idea is most definitely here to stay.  Admittedly, it takes a while for everyone to realize this, but *bitcoin has been around a while.*
Sophomoric ridicule is what I've almost always seen, and I've always downvoted it, and always will.  There's an "bitter angry nerd" effect which is merely trolling, and has no weight as criticism (constructive or otherwise.)

Classic mistake right here.  Several of those shitcoins have some interesting ideas and active development.  Ethereum, for example, has a lot of interesting work behind it, and a branch at some point could constitute a material threat to Bitcoin.
No.  The one thing Bitcoin has that nobody else does is a stranglehold on focused planetary computing power.  Without this, Bitcoin will be superseded by one or more of those shitcoins.
If one of those shitcoins figures how to reward miners better than Bitcoin (over the long term, not the short), I would suggest diversifying into that shitcoin sooner rather than later.
Miners aren't everything.  You need users and devs as well.  A coin can fail due to lack of any of those.  But mining is something a lot of coins don't seem to pay much attention to, and a lot of people in the bitcoin world don't seem to recognize the importance of mining.
Without that hash power, we have nothing.

You want miners to be very well paid.  What Bitcoin brings to the table -- that nobody else does -- is the cold fact of being the single greatest operator of hashing power on the planet.  This is the only thing other than brand that sets it apart from the competition.
If miners aren't well paid, then hash power drops.  Let it drop enough and bitcoin becomes susceptible to various computational attacks.  Loss of trust is one of the very few things that actually could destroy it.

Clinical psychologist with an interest in religion and classical philosophy, has a knack for combining the three in interesting ways that relate powerfully to daily life.  He has a ton of videos on YouTube, might be worth watching an interview or two to get a sense of his flavor.  Might not be your cup of tea, but he deals principally in things like the meaning of life, the meaning of suffering, the nature of evil, the purpose of responsibility and duty, and so on.  It's good stuff which ought to be common knowledge but isn't any more.
He does talk a fair amount about pronouns and genders and so on, and is widely misquoted as having terrible right-wing extremist/fringe ideas.  However, if you actually listen to his views, it is nothing like what is said about him, and not at all like Trump or any of the alt-right icons.  This is arguably a small minority of what he actually talks about and teaches, compared to what I mentioned earlier, so it is too bad more people don't look at everything else he has to say.


He's not, except for being a classical liberal opposed to censorship with a following that overlaps heavily with a good segment of the Bitcoin community (despite the comments here).


If you watch him and like him, feel free.  Otherwise don't worry about it.  The point here is that he is a guy with a pretty wide following who may be able to inspire some additional adoption and awareness of Bitcoin as a competing fundraising model, which is rather important since Patreon and a bunch of others are practicing an obnoxious degree of censorship.

Yes I do.  The whole block size debate is the first time I ever had any marked concern for bitcoin's future.
Thought experiment: The problem here is that if the price drops enough (which could *very* easily happen especially as the big industrial-scale financial monsters move into this space), then the block reward may not be enough to maintain mining capacity.  Miners will idle their rigs if they can't at least pay electricity costs, meaning the hash rate will drop.  Let it drop enough, and the checksum becomes increasingly vulnerable to a double-spend or other corruption, driving the price even further down in a self-reinforcing loop.  At some point, a competing blockchain will attract enough mining power or users to become the dominant global blockchain, and bitcoin will more like bitcoin cash is today.
If you have decent mining fees (at least enough to pay for electricity) then the miners will not have to idle their rigs no matter how low the price goes.
The other problem here is that the block reward diminishes over time.
What incentive is there to continue mining when no more bitcoins are created?

I thought it was quite revealing that each "negative" point was actually a positive point for BitCoin.


This means that it will live (or die) based on its merits, not by force.  Seems like a good thing to me.


Critical mass means volatility and panics.  Let's keep it to slow, steady growth, thank you very much.  No rush.  Critical mass would be a bad thing, IMO.  Critical mass of BitCoin will ideally be like critical mass for Linux.  One day you wake up and the whole world is wandering about with Linux computers in their pocket, to the point that laptops and desktops are becoming retro.  One day you wake up and .. wow, BTC is everywhere, when did that happen?


This also means there is no (well, only a very small) switching cost *into* BTC.  Seems like a plus to me.  Also, it means that BTC will live by its merits (see 


Good.  I don't know if that is the point of BitCoin, but that's one of the very attractive features of it.


Like AR-15 rifles, need has absolutely nothing to do with it.  It's about freedom.  This means that, again, BitCoin will fly on its merits alone.


I feel that if there was any point with some validity, this would be it.  Personally, I think it is a positive.  The volatility is very attractive for speculation in the Austrian sense (not the JP Morgan / GS manipulative sense).  BitCoin needs some old-school speculation to even out the kinks.


This is definitely a plus, considering the sick, twisted sense of "fair" that the writer seems to be espousing.  All transactions public?  Please.  BitCoin is the fairest currency ever made.  The "unfair" qualities are the ones enabling anarcho-capitalism, and are one of BitCoin's great strengths (IMO).

If you are still buying your food from the 1% -- even now, let alone in the future -- *shame on you!*  The whole point of btc is to enable transactions that don't involve the real 1%... banks, governments, corrupt institutions.
Also, to a starving person, gold is useless.  You certainly cannot eat it, nor can you grow it.  You also cannot buy food with it: you must either barter or convert it to fiat.  Bitcoin has a much greater likelihood of being accepted as a second currency in day-to-day transactions than gold.  How can I say that?  Because it is happening right now, pre-collapse.
Post collapse, we just keep using btc.

It's more complicated than that.
Think about refunds/returns.  Does the store refund the original BTC?  Or do they refund the USD value of BTC (which might be much different, generally less)?  With a gift card, there is no question.
As for training, that is also more complicated.  Assume the training is indeed 3 hours (which I think is greatly underestimating, but that's just my opinion).  There is significant overhead in collecting all staff for training.  Managers need more training.  The technical aspects alone are challenging; sometimes bitcoin transactions take a long time to confirm.  Why?  How to talk to customers about this?  How does the store close their books at the end of the day?  Is there insurance for theft of bitcoin during the transaction?
And "some IT integration" is non-trivial for an establishment of any size.  Bitcoin requires new hardware for many/most locations.  The hardware is cheap compared to CC terminals, but the cost is still there.  There is also support/maintenance associated with that hardware.
Personally, I don't think we will see bitcoin directly accepted at major retailers until POS terminal manufacturers offer it.
I'm a tremendous enthusiast for bitcoin, but I am aware that there can be significant costs for companies to adopt it.  I agree that it will likely pay for itself very quickly, but there do need to be customers and I do not think there are enough bitcoin customers (yet) to really justify the cost of adoption outside of small businesses (yet).
I think that is changing, and it might be a very different story in just a few months.  If bitcoin sales increase as much over this next year as they did this past year, next Christmas might be a whole new chapter.

Not offhand, and there certainly wasn't an abrupt end to feudalism.  Firearms in the 16th century were used by men fighting for nobles, against other nobles.  They were not the tools of revolution that I am proposing until much later.  However, they were a more effective means to slaughter nobles and their knights and vassals, and most importantly did not require years of training (unlike long bows or swords).
The last piece is the most important.  Firearms required much less training to be quite deadly.  The resulting slaughter led to quite a bit of strenous restrictions on firearms (and crossbow) ownership.  It is hard to build and maintain a large and powerful army when it so easy to lose men to firepower in relatively untrained hands.
To come back to your original point, if you want I can dig through my books and find an actual source, but if you look up gunpowder/feudalism there is quite a bit of material on the topic.

You missed the whole point, the central piece to the whole system.  Those CFTC letters meant JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs could issue shorts as if they were mining companies.  Mining companies do not get margin calls if the market price goes up before the contract is due.  This is because it is presumed that they will be able to provide the actual metal by the time the contract is due.
Nowadays, those letters are obsolete because the definition of bona fide hedging has been expanded to include business risk.
A short squeeze only works if you can apply margin pressure to short holders.  You can't squeeze miners.  Nor can you sqeeze JPMorgan.  Indeed, they can just issue more shorts, eventually driving the market down and crushing you.


As outlined above.


CME mini silver.  Perhaps a full contract would have been better.  There are "delivery" fees, but the cost of actually sending a truck to your bank to offload metal is quite a different matter.

OK, I'm going to do my best to explain.  Quite a bit of this is hypothetical because government is a fact of life in Western culture for thousands of years, but I will try to put together the pieces.
Defunding government brings about peace because war is 100 percent a function of government.  No wars within the last thousand years have been anything but conflicting governments, as far as I am aware.  Even events such as the Rwandan genocide have been government operations (government troops, government equipment, etc).  So, logically, get rid of governments, get rid of war, right?
Well, reality does not quite work like that, but I will come back to this point.
Mafia: Doesn't the mafia obtain its money through illegal actions like extortion, racketeering, drugs, and prostitution?  I suggest that some of these -- certainly drugs, and possibily prostitution -- are only problems because government outlaws them.  The absence of government would only improve these situations.  (If you disagree, I can discuss this in MUCH further depth, but it is off the current topic of discussion.)  For the other actions, such as extortion and racketeering, we still need a justice system.
However, a justice system does not require a government.  There are many very effective systems of justice that do not require government.  In the West, we have Common Law.  In Africa, the Somalis have used a system called Xeer for thousands of years (detailed in a book called, "Law of the Somalis" which is a fantastic book on the topic).  China and Japan have their own systems of traditional common law.  The Native Americans developed several systems of common law.  I strongly believe that the injurious aspects of organized crime may be adequately addressed by these ancient systems.  If you disagree, I encourage you to research them and come to your own conclusion on this.  I can point you in various directions depending on what might interest you most.
Now, back to the original point, as I address your final statement about unelected strongmen.  There is one single factor that completely changed the equation between the days of the Huns and modern times.  Before this single factor, I would say that governments are absolutely a necessity.  After this single factor, I propose that governments are simply obsolete.
I suggest that the protective functions of government were made unnecessary by the invention and popularity of accurate, portable, repeating firearms.
I don't know how you feel about firearms, so I hope you are still reading.  
There can be no Ghengis Khan in a world where someone with [a spare weekend]( and a few hundred dollars can wipe out a soldier with every breath.  And in a world where governments cannot collect taxes because their population no longer uses "money," there can be no mechanized support.
I recognize that this barely scratches the surface.  There is vast depth to your question, and I may have only created more questions instead of answering any.  If you are still curious, I would be happy to continue this discussion.

You.  You are awesome, man.  I am pretty sure I cannot convince you to change your views, because I am not speaking with the authority of academia.  I would invite you to consider a different world view, though.


Totally correct.  Your discussion about time costs is spot-on.  I think you are missing something really important, however.  There is a vast reservoir of people who have no money but lots and lots of time.  For those of us (like myself) who have nice jobs and a car, fiat is the preferable way to obtain bitcoin until my employer starts paying in bitcoin.  The vast majority of people in the world do not have jobs, and for them, spending time is by far the preferable option.


Completely correct!  A deflationary currency works differently in some very subtle ways.  Did you see the man offering a house and land for 36 BTC?  Incredible!  At the current rate of growth, if I were paid in bitcoin, my income would drop by the day.  Is this bad?  No, as long as I don't spend it all.  Any reserve that I do not immediately spend becomes worth more the longer I hold it, which returns us to the point of my original post.


If I sell a house for 10 bitcoin, clearly I value 10 bitcoin more than the house, correct?  And the buyer clearly values the house more than his 10 bitcoin, correct?  So both of us have gained something that we value more than what we lost.  The transaction has increased the total subjective perception of value in existance.
I have just played a mean philosophical trick on you, because value is completely subjective.  Nothing has value unless some human assigns value to it.  In the house transaction, both parties increase their personal valuation.  Both parties gain something more valuable to them than what they lost.  It is therefore a positive-sum game.
Obviously, that value does not hold unless we can somehow make it similarly valuable to others.  I retain my bitcoin for a few months, the buyer spends a bunch of time improving the house, and voila! our holdings have grown in perceived value to others.


They are not, that is the point.  In order to induce them to part with their bitcoin, you have to make something that will last.  You have to make something that gains in value over time, in order to induce people to part with both bitcoin and the future value of bitcoin.
Obviously, things wear out.  What this really means is that you have to sell things that are repairable and high quality.  For consumables such as food, you can't just sell food, you have to sell food that improves health.  People will not buy things just to spend money.  People will only buy things that appreciate in value, or improve the value of something else (such as personal health).
In other words, you can't just churn out factory goods and expect people to part with their bitcoin, especially older people with lots of bitcoin.  You have to put care and workmanship into the product, and you have to design for longevity instead of warranty periods.


I am sorry you got hung up on my comment about debt.  Once bitcoin stabilizes a bit, debt becomes a possibility.  In the mean time, raising capital seems to be a simple matter of just holding on to a few bitcoins for a couple years.  If bitcoin stabliizes, then debt institutions will rise up.


Can you suspend your training for a moment and look at the bigger picture?  In the current growth period, raising cash is a matter of simply sitting on coins for a while.  Obviously this will not last forever.  Once growth tapers off, raising cash becomes a matter of having an idea good enough to entice wealthy investors that your idea will provide more growth than just holding on to bitcoins.  This is a very old idea that really does not change with bitcoin.
As an aside, I would recommend you investigate Islamic banking.  Muslims have been conducting business for centuries without using traditional, Western forms of debt.  When raising money, it is a fundamentally different process than in Western banking.  It is a system that is probably more agreeable with a deflationary currency than traditional debt.  (don't assume Islamic banking is fringe or extremeist:  Citi, HSBC, and JPMorgan all offer Islamic banking solutions)
I hope I have at least helped you to broaden your viewpoint.  If not, perhaps others can benefit from the clarifications and expansions.

In my opinion, collapse is inevitable.  Adopting deflationary currency means we actively engage in sustainable collapse, which means we *just might* have a shot at preserving this civilization (as opposed to all the ones that came before us, which collapsed catastrophically).

As a customer, don't spend your bitcoins with untrustworthy merchants.  Easy fix.  The idea that you can just drop money on expensive items over the Internet and just ask for a chargeback if you feel like it is done.
For big-ticket items, escrow is appropriate and available.

No factor is inevitable, but Wall St interest is perfectly capable of running it that high, in my opinion.
Also, at some point, I feel we will hit some point of critical mass where lots of just "get it" and we start conducting end-to-end transactions in bitcoin (sellers keep their sales in bitcoin, and start buying things in bitcoin.)  If this starts to happen, it will reduce some of the selling pressure and help increase the price of bitcoin.
Of course, if more major governments move against bitcoin, it will crash (at least temporarily).  I consider this to be virtually inevitable as well.

There's a huge difference: Bitcoin makes it easy for an ordinary person to engage in black market activities without looking *too* suspicious.  5K in cash is damn suspicious, and subject to arbitrary asset forfeiture.  5K in BTC is completely obscure to anyone except the actual participants in the transaction.

Exactly!  You sure as shit aren't going to spend bitcoin on fad trinkets from China.
However, I suggest it also applies to food.  Because why would you spend bitcoin on food you can grow yourself?  Especially if work is scarce.  In fact, it might be a great idea to work with your neighbors and try to share some labor and maybe not have to spend bitcoin on any food at all.

Woah dude, 2 days.  I would notice after a week or two when I went to pay my bills.
I'm not worried about thieves stealing either money or bitcoin.  You have to take simple precautions to protect both.  Bitcoin is vastly simpler to protect than cash.
I am considerably more worried about public-sector theft and inflationary devaluing.  In these respects, cash is simply not a consideration, while bitcoin is more or less equivalent to precious metals (barring a catastrophic protocol failure).
My point was simply that cash is readily stolen and you do not necessarily have much (or any) recourse.  Now I will grant you that there are some degrees of recourse.  However, the lack of simliar mechanisms in bitcoin simply indicate the immaturity of the market rather than a fundamental failure in the system.  When the depth is greater, I am completely comfortable that we will start seeing bitcoin deposit insurance of some type.

I think you may not have a good idea of how things work in countries with multiple currencies.  Here's a hint; it's not that bad.  Bitcoin is becoming a parallel currency.  It has certain advantages over cash and credit cards that make it very attractive for certain people, both vendors and customers.
For me, I am not worried if bitcoin never claims more than a tiny share of economic transactions.  I will be happy that there is an alternative in case the US dollar ever really crashes.  If we can move quickly to a secondary currency (i.e. one we are already using), then a dollar crash isn't something to necessarily fear.
If the idea of a dollar crash scares you, perhaps you should learn about what happens when countries undergo a currency crash and prepare accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:48:53
Yes, I see that.  However, the log trend looks really strong, and 2k is kinda far off that line.  If we go that high, I would expect a really steep crash, followed by a stablization like you describe.

If I could pick one reason to love Bitcoin, it would be this.  Economic activity is essentially synonymous with environmental destruction and/or resource exhaustion.  Adopting a currency that prioritizes HODL'ing over consumption is a great way to extend our resource utilization curves, and help the earth regain some of its ability to absorb the impact of human life.
It means jobs get scarce.  But it also means we have a planet for our children and grandchildren.  Which would *you* pick?

I'm saying, no reason to sell.  In fact, there is only reason to buy, since nothing other than emotion is causing the current madness.  It's an enormous opportunity.
The last big crash was caused by an actual security breach.  Not in the protocol, to be sure, but it was still a real cause.  This crash is another thing altogether: the only people who have lost money are the ones who have consciously sold at a loss.

1) It is an interesting question, but one I believe is being solved.  The reason for this is that we are experiencing a slow slide into anarchy in this country.  Most of the US is cutting back police forces, sometimes to the point that there is no emergency response even in some well-populated areas.  There are starting to be neighborhood pools (crowdfunded, if you will) to fund private security.  I am going to guess that you are repulsed by this idea, but I would invite you to actually research the instances where this is the case.  You might be surprised: I know I was.
Right now, all such efforts are being accomplished with regular money.  However, I do not think the solution changes at all if you introduce bitcoin.  Either way, people have to provide for their security, and most of us have zero interest in training or equiping ourselves for the task.
2) Organization of force.  I do not think I am going to influence your opinion on this one, but I suggest that your consider all the cases in history where assymetric warfare wins.  The American Revolution is a classic example.  9/11 is another example of assymetrical warfare.  This is where firearms come into play.  It is hard to organize force when your enemy can kill you from so far away that you cannot even see them without magnification.  Of course this goes both ways.  However, the cards are stacked in favor of the side that does not have to organize themselves.
Something to keep in mind; the US military has had dubious success in the Middle East, but their opponents are utterly lacking in either the knowledge or the equipment for marksmanship.  They do not have glasses, they not have scopes, and they do not know how to use or adjust sights.  One sniper in the Battle of Fallujah held up the US Marines for a week.  This is what just one properly-utilized firearm can accomplish against a highly-trained organized force.


Yes.  I have a lot of faith in people's innate goodness and ability to look out for their neighbors.  This is not really a popular idea, but it is what I observe around me when bad things happen.
3) I'm not sure how to respond to this.  Have you ever seen the Killdozer video?  This is something almost exactly like what you describe, but real.  
I think your scenario is unrealistic because I believe the vast majority of people are good, honest, and upright.  I will admit that there are a small number of people (such as the Killdozer guy) who attempt what you describe.  When that incredibly rare event occurs, we act in self-defense.
Have you ever fired a rifle?  A simple .223, the most common rifle caliber in America, will readily defeat most non-mechanized armor.  A .30-06 is a bit heavier and is accurate to 1,000 meters or more.  As for mechanized armor...it all needs fuel.
This situation goes right back to the early days of firearms.  A gun makes it really easy to kill someone.  As long as nobody is trampling about robbing and hurting people, everything is fine.  As soon as someone starts hurting people (whether ancient feudalism or modern strongman buying a tank or helicopter to terrorize the neighborhood), firearms make it very easy for all the good, honest, upright people to act in self-defense and protect themselves.
The most interesting part of this discussion is the fact that it is actually quite irrelevant.  As I mentioned before, this country is sliding into anarchy.  I believe that people will find peaceful ways to protect themselves and their families while living good and fulfilling lives.  Our governments (federal, state, and local) are slowly collapsing thanks to bad monetary policy, bad cash flow, and an ageing population.  So it will become our responsibility to once again assume all the roles that government has filled for us.
The question is not what might happen if government disappears.  The question is, how are we going to live *when* it disappears.  Based on how people are handling loss of important services so far, I feel that my positive opinion of peoples' basic behavior is appropriate.
After all, it is just a matter of time.  Bitcoin merely serves to help the transition by providing a currency we can use independently of collapsing monetary systems.

On the other hand, if the vendor is well-established with many customers and a good reputation, then perhaps you might be willing to send them cash (or a bank wire).  That is when you might be able to consider sending bitcoin.

So if I read you correctly, you do not believe bitcoin's deflationary nature will begin to be a problem until it starts to supplant national currencies?  Sounds to me like an excellent reason to hop aboard, since that's never going to happen, right?
Now as to your actual argument, I think you are absolutely correct except in the application, and you are missing a major point, although you allude to it briefly.
Firstly, the deflation suffered by the nationalities you mention is post-inflationary deflation.  It is radically different than a deflationary currency.  The problem for those countries is inflation, which causes misallocation of resources.  When the inflation stops, those resources must be reallocated or liquidated.  When that happens, loans are defaulted and capital destruction occurs, worsening the deflation.  We have not really seen this outside of fiat currency, but Spain suffered the ills of inflation/recession while on the gold standard due to the massive influx of gold from the new world.  However, this is not the crucial point.
You mention that economies grow by increasing inputs, or by increasing efficiency.  The latter point seems to be forgotten in the rest of your argument, which is unfortunate because that is what a deflationary currency is about.
Can we both agree that a deflationary currency requires a merchant to convince customers to part with both currency and the future value of that currency?  Is this not the core of the problem with a deflationary currency?
What this means is that a merchant needs to sell things that last, things thst are repairable, or even gain in value over time where possible.  Disposable products are not plausible in a deflationary currency because they are wasteful, and nobody wants to waste the future value of their money.
Now, take a step back.  Does this not mean an end to modern consumerism?  An end to the gluttonous wastefulness destroying the earth?  We all must buy or grow food, but what farmer would spend money on seeds that can only be planted once?  Why buy fossil fuel that can never be reused?  Why buy plastic bags and only use them once?  Doesn't a deflationary currency pursue efficiency over all else, encourage recycling and reuse while severely discouraging waste and excess?
Fossil fuels are a bad expenditure, but neighborhood-scale ethanol distilleries are not.  And that, I believe, is the key to why a deflationary currency is a good thing despite most of what you describe being true.

So...uhhh... not to be obtuse, but how does this match up with the continuing growth of the Bitcoin economy?


This is false.  The recession is caused by fear resulting from widespread capital destruction.  When people do not feel secure, they withhold purchasing anything more than necessities.  If we did not have the giant boom, then we would not have had the recession.  There is a critical difference between the recession and a deflationary currency.  The US dollar is not gaining in value during this recession.  A deflationary currency gains in value over time.


We don't know whether a deflationary currency will work because we haven't tried one for several generations and nobody alive remembers what it was like.  It was abandoned then for the same reason we don't have it now; deflationary currencies do not allow government to create money at the stroke of a pen.  In a deflationary currency, government must tax in order to raise revenue.  On the other hand, in an inflationary environment, government can make all kinds of crazy promises and fulfill them by simply making more money.

If deflation is a transfer of wealth to those who already have money, then what is inflation?
You are missing the bigger picture.  A deflationary currency always favors savers over time, that is the beauty of it.  If you get in late, you are still getting in earlier than others.  Such is always the case, for generations.  You are still getting in earlier than people who haven't been born.
You may be poor but the bitcoin you bought with $20 a few years ago is the seed of great wealth today.  Similarly, what you buy with $20 today is the seed of great wealth a few years down the line.  This repeats in whatever time frame we look at.

Generally speaking, exchanges have a history of insecurity.  You generally shouldn't keep any significant amount of bitcoin in exchanges.  How much is significant?  Well, how much are you willing to lose to a hacker?
OK so paper wallets...
Bitcoin is just a giant ledger.  When you have a "wallet," that wallet is really just two pieces of information: a public key and a private key.  Those two pieces of information, together, allow you to manage the balance of that entry in the giant ledger book (a.k.a. "blockchain").
This is an important distinction.  You don't have "bitcoins."  Your wallet is just the access information for your "page" in the giant global ledger.
The public key allows people to deposit money.  The private key allows you to send money.  For how this works, look up public key cryptography.
The public key can be published globally so anyone can send you money.
The private key must be kept secret.  Anyone with your private key can move a balance out of your "page" in the giant ledger book.
The cool thing is that the public and private keys are related by **math**.  You can create a key pair *offline* and print it out / write it down.  You can send bitcoin to the public key by just entering in the public key in Coinbase's "send bitcoin" interface.  Because the private key has never been online, no-one online can discover it.  They would need to physically steal it from you.  **This is a paper wallet.**
It works by math.  When you create a "wallet", all you are doing is creating two strings that are mathematically related.
I hope this helps.
OK now in practical terms, what does this mean?  I keep about $500 worth in a blockchain.info wallet.  I keep spending cash ($100-150 worth) in an Android wallet on my phone.  Anything else (i.e. savings) goes in paper wallets in duplicate locations to prevent fire loss.
Paper wallet: hard to access, safe(r)
Blockchain.info: easier to access, moderately safe
Android wallet: dead simple to access, not very safe (malware, physical theft of phone)
edit: TO SPEND BITCOIN OUTSIDE OF COINBASE/BLOCKCHAIN:
This is what I use the Android wallet for.  Every bitcoin-enabled merchant I have seen provides a QR-code for sending bitcoin that includes both the address and the amount.  This applies to both online and offline merchants.  I open up the Android wallet, touch the camera icon, take a picture of the QR-code, verify the amount, and press "Send".  The end.

What, no rebuttal for why BitPay is growing?  :)
I feel that you are not really paying much attention to the real bitcoin news outside of all the bubble hype.  Yes, bitcoin communities love you, but that doesn't necessarily translate to actual sales.  What merchants observe is there is an initial burst of sales in bitcoin when they first announce, which tapers off.  However, sales in bitcoins does not taper to zero, it stabilizes.  Is this because of just the bitcoin community, or because of a baseline growth in the bitcoin economy?
I hold that it doesn't matter, and it is probably a little of both.  The fact is, sales in bitcoin remain steady.  That means this is real.


Coming soon!  :)

The idea that socialism requires a government in order to collect taxes and redistribute wealth is false.
That is a particular facet of Communism.  I think Trotsky was particularly influential in this idea. and he believed that humans are inherently lazy and must be forced to work.
It is worth noting that both communism and socialism are largely pro-gun, as the continuance of a communist society requires the working class to own and maintain arms.  Marx recognized this, as well as others up through the present time.
As to your original question, I think Bitcoin is a great way to enable socialism in its orginal, non-violent sense.

Nope.  This is been thoroughly debunked by others, but fresh blood is not what keeps bitcoin alive.  The price rises because new people are coming in, but the price would hold steady if nobody new came in.  It might drop slightly because more blocks are being mined, but the price of bitcoin does not require new people to come in.
The current bubble might pop, but that gets into bubble psychology and every financial instrument is affected by that (i.e. it's a completely different question and has nothing to do with inflation or deflation).


False.  A cup of coffee that sells for 0.0013 bitcoin today will simply sell for 0.000013 bitcoin in the future.  You might earn 0.8 bitcoin per week today, and your children might only earn 0.008 bitcoin per week, but it doesn't matter because everything else reduces in price as well.  It has to, in order to induce people to part with their bitcoin that becomes more valuable over time.


Because people in poverty desperately need a way to keep money secure without a bank account.  Bitcoin does not need a credit check or a government ID, and it is simple to secure from physical theft.
But most importantly, I think it will help the poor because it already is helping the poor.
Like everything else with bitcoin, it is a slow start.  Do not dismiss these ideas simply because they have not enjoyed universal adoption instantaneously.

Oh, absolutely.  But the thing is, there is a new approach to gun bans being pushed: mental health.
If a major ban goes through preventing people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness, or preventing people who have ever been prescribed anti-psychotic medications, then there will suddenly be a huge class of people who will no longer be able to own firearms.
It's one thing in the African-American communities where there is no family tradition of owning guns.  It will be something entirely different when whole chunks of gunowners and their children will be suddenly unable to legally own firearms.
If that happens, I suspect quite a lot of them will begin purchasing firearms on the black market.  Bitcoin makes that market reachable by otherwise-clean individuals.
For myself, I actually have no idea how to interact with the (apparently healthy) black market in my area, nor do I have any desire to do so.  But I do know how to use Tor and Bitcoin, and I suspect I am not the only one in this situation.
I would absolutely prefer to purchase guns legally.  Legal guns means I can take them to a local range, participate in local competitions, and interact with law enforcement with confidence in my innocence.  The fact that only certain guns are illegal in my municipality (machine guns, silencers, most pistols, most modern rifles) means that I still have plenty of choices to choose from.
I really hope I can continue to buy and own firearms and never have to actually figure out whether or not the law comes before firearms in my heart.


With all due respect, this statement is probably not correct.  People going under the table certainly afford a convenient excuse to tighten control, but the goal of eventual tracking and confiscation is pursued regardless of excuses.

There can be good reasons to lose $75k.  You do not know the motivations behind that.

Not only are they building real wealth in that scenario, but they get to write off a $75k loss on their taxes.

Simple.  Buying physical costs money.  Can you really call the bluff, when JPM can simply hand you as many promises as you ask for?
They can place unlimited, unbacked, short contracts.  Those promises get fulfilled with rehypothecated promises that you "own" metal in their warehouses.
Now, if you try to actually take delivery, as in back-up-the-truck-beep-beep-beep delivery, that is a different story.  The delays in physical delivery are infamous, and it is very difficult to actually take physical delivery.  I tried, at one point, and the delivery fee alone was stupidly ridiculous (on the order of the value of the contract, for a mini-silver contract).  So if they can charge a delivery fee so high that it covers their cost of buying at the actual market price*, for those few people that actually ask for physical metal, then the game continues in perpetuity.
*edit: By "actual market price" I mean off-exchange, which is considerably higher than future spot, for the same bars.

You have hit precisely upon the pivotal points of my argument; common law and widespread firearms ownership.
English common law did continue to evolve under the feudal system, but it was well-established considerably before the Norman invasion in 1066.  In fact, although considerable cross-pollination occurred between English common law and Roman civil law, common law was sufficiently well established that Roman contact did not bring the adoption of Roman civil law as it did in many other areas.  The distinction between common law and feudalism may seem slight at first glance, but it is important.  Common law is distributed among the population, whereas feudalism is top-down control.  One is organic, the other is hierarchical.
Critically, one survived the advent of firearms (indeed, common law survives to this day), but feudalism did not.  In fact, the primary use of firearms was against the feudal nobility.  History tells us that you cannot treat an armed population like cattle.
Xeer is a really interesting form of traditional common law.  I cannot recommend Michael van Notten's book [Law of the Somalis]( enough, if you are interested in this.  Traditional law in the Horn of Africa arose in a nomadic environment with no fixed institutions.  Some of the features of this law system are quite interesting, and could be applied amongst ourselves as we progressively lose access to the justice system.
For example, the Somalis did not believe that punishment should be equal for everyone.  Instead, the Somalis scaled punishments up depending on the perpetrator's power.  The idea is that a powerful elder has a much greater potential to harm more people, so their punishment must be greater in order to both repair damage in the case of restitution, and deter future criminal activity.
In another example, the Somalis used a complex system of insurance to mete out punishments.  If the perpetrator of a crime was unable to make restitution for damages, their family -- or even tribe -- were required to make restitution.  In this regard, tribes and families had a very powerful incentive to keep their young or impetuous members in line.
There were other systems of law in different parts of Africa, but this is one that I find particularly interesting.
It is interesting to note that our American system of government is actually modelled very strongly on the Iroquois system of government.  Many of our ideas concerning equality under the law, freedom of religion, and the entire federal/state structure are borrowed from or heavily influenced by Iroquois law.
As for the second point, yes, I believe we cannot exist peacefully without government unless we have widespread ownership of firearms among the general population.  I am not concerned about a return to feudalism because the invention of firearms is what ended feudalism in the first place.  The only thing that has changed is that the tools to end feudalism today are vastly more efficient than they were in 1600.
Personally, I believe that an armed population will never have to actually use their firearms to stop local strongmen.  The simple fact of being armed is a powerful deterrent to aggression, even by strongmen who are similarly armed.  This is illustrated in history by the fact that before any serious genocidal action is attempted, the affected populations are always disarmed first.  If the population is not first disarmed, the genocide simply never happens.
As a small aside, Karl Marx believed than an armed population was necessary for a communist state to endure, in order to prevent the bloody nightmare that has been so vividly demonstrated in modern communist nations.
I believe it is crucial to note that even in conflicts such as the current civil war in Syria, the population is completely disarmed.  This may seem completely insane to even suggest, but the fact is that the rebels are being armed only by shipments from foreign governments and theft/defection from Assad's forces.  There are two groups in Syria who are armed: the government and the rebels.  The people are not, and the violence being executed on the (unarmed) population is appalling.
Would the story of Syria be different if they had a populist gun culture like we do in the United States, or Switzerland, or even Finland?  I believe the answer is "YES," based on history.
This is my philosophy for how we might live and prosper safely and peacefully in the event that bitcoin supplants traditional forms of government.  I am curious as to any rebuttals or critiques you may have.

I understand that very well: you are not the first person to mention this concern.
You have correctly identified that deflationary currencies discourage consumption.  Is that a good thing?  From my point of view, the cataclysmic approach of global climate change is caused by over-consumption fueled by inflationary currencies.  If people would limit their consumption to *necessities* then perhaps we wouldn't have so much pollution and environmental destruction.
However, there is a whole different side to deflationary currencies that you do not mention.  Deflationary currencies encourage saving and reinvestment.  In a deflationary currency, you want to save as much as you can.  If possible, you want your savings to make more for you.
There are two major things wrong with the "developed" world:
1) Decaying infrastructure, lack of reinvestment
2) Excessive consumption of natural resources
A deflationary currency solves both of these problems.
I think a lot of people are using Bitcoins.  I'm using Bitcoins.  In fact, I made my first real-world face-to-face purchase with btc just yesterday.  People are paying for Reddit gold with btc.  People are paying for web services and hosting services and doctors visits with btc.
It's happening enough that I think the idea that a deflationary currency will inhibit spending to the point of collapse is probably false.

You need to buy Mt. Gox and sell Other at the same time, then settle.  Then you keep your btc while the cash settles through the system.
Once you do that a couple loops, you'll have enough cash moving to keep a constant flow.
Best of luck.

I guess you were serious.
Bitcoin use as a payment method is an important interim before it can be used as a currency.  People will hold bitcoins as soon as it becomes possible to pay for things they need with bitcoins.  Why suffer even the 1% fee when you can just keep everything in bitcoins?
Once you can buy gasoline with bitcoins, then people will start holding bitcoins.  Until then, the more people use it as a payment system only, the better.  If enough people accept bitcoins, merchants will start to hold instead of convert.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean.  I don't think MtGox will fill an order .01% above or below your requested purchase point, although it can sometimes be smaller fractions off (haven't had one of those in a while, usually they are split orders for larger quantities).

It's OK if the settlement takes days.  The important thing is for the actual trades to happen nearly simultaneously.  In reality, you probably won't have to do much settling, because a variance in one direction as the market moves will likely be offset by a variance in the opposite direction as the market moves the other way.

It takes money to buy guns, money to buy the power and control they crave.  They must spend money in order to gain that destructive power.
With normal currencies, they can print more, or borrow more into existance.  With Bitcoin, they cannot.  They must either (a) have it (b) mine it (c) earn it.  Some people already have it, but once spent they cannot print more.  They could mine it, but within a fairly short amount of time, it will impractical even for governments to attempt that.  Earn it?  hahaha the US government can't even run a brothel profitably.  The oldest trade in the world, and they can't even do that.
The cool thing is, if the common folks of the world switch to Bitcoin, it will starve the governments of tax money.  The velocity will skyrocket, and the currencies will collapse.  Without the ability to track Bitcoin like they can track bank deposits, taxation will fall flat unless it is paid truely voluntarily in exchange for worthwhile services ... and nuclear weapons do not qualify.

Making Bitcoin illegal will be the best thing to ever happen to it, based on historical precedent.

There is literally no position anyone can take with bitcoin that could be backed up with research.  Your request could be applied to any claim with bitcoin, and you would succeed in feeling smugly superier no matter your opponent because research simply doesn't exist.

The biggest problem is that PHP is not compiled, and the execution time ramps linearly with the size of the executed code.  This applies even if you have accelerators such as eAccelerator or APC.  I do not know if HipHop suffers from the same problem.
If you have even a moderately large code base, then run time does not remain negligible if you have a high-traffic situation.  The worst part is that it is CPU load, not IO or memory or anything easy like that.  The problem with CPU load is that PHP is completely non-threadable.  You are stuck with a linear execution, unless you start shelling requests out to multiple PHP processes ... terrible.
On top of this, there are certain features of PHP that add a big overhead.  Object instantiation adds an order of magnitude to runtime.  If you have even a moderately-sized OO framework, you are looking at large fractions of a second just to display content to the browser, let alone doing anything interesting.  Remember that bit about execution time scaling with code size?  Objects load all their parents when they are instantiated.
There are other problems, such as the fact that scoped variables are leaked when an exception is thrown.  If you are using exceptions for run-time control (i.e. validation) then you will run into major memory problems.
Then there are other fun little quirks of the language.  Function execution is faster than object instantiation, which kinda makes sense.  But if() tests are faster by 10-20 percent than switch() statements.  Ask me how I know this ... D:
So basically, PHP is a great language because it is simple, easy, popular, and reasonably effective.  But if you ever get big, you are stuck with either moving your core functionality into PHP extensions (hello C, haven't seen you in 20 years) or porting to a different language.
Years ago, when Freshmeat.net was just getting popular, they were running PHP while Slashdot was running Perl/CGI.pm.  Now CGI.pm is a pile of cruft in some ways, but Slashdot was handling everything with a quad Xeon and a separate database server.  Freshmeat had a server farm despite significantly less traffic.  This is really interesting, because Perl is also an interpreted scripting language.  The two languages should not be that far apart in performance, but they really are.
Just as a point of comparison, Python is about 1.5-2 orders of magnitude faster than PHP in real basic stuff like object instantiation and processing loops.  Python also does not have the assinine runtime-vs-codebase scaling issues.
I could go on and on but those are the principle issues that I battle on a daily basis.  :/

Bitcoin looks like a bubble, for sure.  It is as close to an exponential rise as I could ever hope to see.  For most instruments, this spells certain doom.  Is bitcoin one of them?  Eventually, I think yes, but I feel that the crash off that peak will be several zeros above where we are now.
One possibility is that a different cryptocurrency could come along that does things better than bitcoin, and everybody switches.  If someone figures out how to have private ledgers, that might get the job done.


I am not personally concerned about that.  Bitcoin -- and bitcoiners -- need to grow up quite a lot.  Some caution and wisdom is greatly necessary throughout the bitcoin community.  There is more than enough room for the wisdom of well-thought-out finance.
Ideologically, bitcoin is not going to change.  If it does, another cryptocurrency will supplant it.  Of this I am utterly confident.  The reason I am confident is represented by people like Eric Raymond and Edward Snowden, and the fact that the tech industry has remained completely free of unionization and licensing.  Tech people tend strongly toward libertarianism.
I suspect the final answer is a combination.  Bitcoin as a protocol will remain unfettered anarchy, but enormous order can be built on top of it.  For example, bitcoin badly needs a futures and derivatives market so merchants can offload (and obtain) bitcoin over time at reliable pricing.  This requires more than a 2-bit PHP hacker like myself with a dream and an anonymously-registered domain.  This needs actual financial minds.
For people in the West, order will prevail.  Most of us would probably rather pay a fee to have someone else keep their bitcoin, than deal with malware and viruses that can empty a wallet in seconds.  For people under more oppressive governments, bitcoin represents freedom but chaos will prevail.
That's how I see it, anyway.  There is plenty of room for both the anarchists and the financiers at this table.

Your timeline is all sorts of messed up.  Marx died in the late 1800s as I recall, long before WWI.
Anarchism and communism are completely different animals.  For one, anarchy is a much broader discipline, spanning the full breadth of radical left to radical right, and encompassing violent revolutionaries and devoted pacifists.  You have a strong, negative reaction to the idea of "anarchy," but I suggest that you are experiencing symbol reaction caused by excessive exposure to authoritarian indoctrination.  You should read up on some of the non-violent anarchist ideology, because there are some good ideas that are linked very closely to what is happening with Bitcoin right now.
What happened in Russia is that Trotsky came along, who believed that man is inherently lazy and must be forced to work.  Of course you cannot force an armed populace, so they disarmed the populace and commenced killing off rival factions of communism...and Christians ... and Ukrainians ... and Tsarists ... and all the rest.


This is a very interesting set of beliefs.
1) Native peoples around the globe did not necessarily have concepts of private property.  The notion of "private property" as we understand it is a uniquely European idea in many respects.  As such, "private property" is a comparatively recent phenomenon.  The world got along just fine without private property for a very long period of time, and when our civilization collapse, it will continue without private property.
2) Who owns Bitcoin?  The free-market capitalists would hold that money must be privately minted and owned.  Yet Bitcoin is created and owned by the people who use it.  A perfect socialism, utterly decentralized and very functional.  Of course, it enables the most rabid of cut-throat capitalist markets.  However, the currency itself is not privately owned; in fact, in *cannot* be privately owned.
There is no utopia, socialist or otherwise.

No.  PayPal is not just USD.  PayPal can use a multitude of currencies.  Currency A in -&gt; Currency A out is the scenario.  If you use PayPal to do an A -&gt; B transfer, then you will take a conversion hit in addition to PayPal's fees.
It just so happens that a particular currency (btc) -- which it just so happens is not supported by PayPal -- has a totally different fee structure.
Bitcoin is not fiat, and should not be used for moving fiat, mostly because the fiat is frankly pretty terrible compared to bitcoin.  Bitcoin is good for capital flight, but once you have value in Bitcoin, why would you ever move it out until the specific moment of purchasing something?  I mean, duh....

The point of bitcoin is that it is its own currency.  If it ends up having easy conversion into other currencies, that will help adoption.  At least, that is the point of it to me.  Along the way, people will find countless uses for it, but the end goal is a full economic system using anonymous, distributed, cryptocurrencies.  Totally my subjective opinion here...

Yes, most of my work has been with online payment processors.  However, not all.  I have been involved with various POS setups, mostly doctor's offices and one technical training facility.  What you call "extremely overpriced" is extremely low for brick-and-mortar businesses.  EYE-AM's statements are more in line with reality: 5-7% is typical, 4-5% is extremely good.
The technical training facility had an extremely feisty and pushy secretary, who was able to bargain her processor down to 3.2 percent for a $30,000 charge.  She was overjoyed.  When salespeople would come to sell other merchant services, she would tell them her rate, and they would just get up and leave.
Lots and lots of merchant services advertise much lower rates.  However, when you add everything up at the end of the month and look at your actual fees, 2.8 percent is nearly impossibly low unless you are a *huge* business.

In those terms, the answer is obvious.  However, the question is short-sighted.  We all have to eat.  We all need shelter and water.  Men like to buy pretty things to impress their partners, and girls like to buy pretty things to show themselves off.
We do not live in a vacuum.  Does it matter if most people hold bitcoin?  All it does is improve the valuation of every else's bitcoin.  After all, we have a long way to go: bitcoin can reach $1,000,000 per coin before it becomes impractical to buy coffee with it, and I remember reading that the 6-decimal-place-divisibility is easily extended.

This is flat-out false.  There are plenty of private deposit insurers in the US.  My credit union doesn't even list FDIC insurance, instead listing two private deposit insurers (insured to a higher level than FDIC insurance, and with faster payouts).


Actually, insurance companies have bigger funding than government promises.  I don't know what rock you've been hiding under, but it is beyond time to drop the statist propaganda and join the real world.


Lack of imagination here.  Even basic bitcoin security involves taking wallets offline.  There are lots of opportunities for security between instantaneous access and time-consuming ultimate safety.  Both are perfectly possible with bitcoin.  It is just easy to have everything instantly available, and that is how people get burned.

The threat model is indeed very different, but if you take an objective look at the situation, bitcoin's apparent weakness in safety is no different than cash.
The biggest difference that I see is that the transfer is instantaneous and irreversible.  Hardware wallets might help with this.  Additionally, having wallet software whose only possible egress is via a 3-way spend (bitcoin escrow) might help.  We'll see.

By all means!  Bitcoin is certainly not for everyone, and not for the faint-hearted.  It will be curious to see when Bitcoin stabilizes.  It could be decades before it stabilizes, and final price could be well north of $1mil per bitcoin.  So it would be pretty smart to drop $50 (or whatever play money) on a small slice of that pie, on the off chance that it does take off.
That's my thought, anyway.  If it takes off, every person buying now will be solidly in the 1%.  Even the miner's fees constitute tremendous wealth in future terms if this thing supplants even a single nation's currency, let alone globally.

Why do you think deflationary currency is bad?  The idea that deflation is bad comes from post-inflationary deflation, which is a completely different animal.
Deflationary currency means if you want to sell something, you have to make it valuable enough to convince people to part with both the bitcoin and the bitcoin's future value, correct?  Does this not mean an end to consumerism and return to making things that last?  Does this not mean a return to quality over disposability?  Does this not mean an end to the gluttonous consumption and waste that is destroying the planet?
The idea that deflation means the economy stagnates is patently false on the face of it.  Bitcoin has been undergoing severe deflation since its inception almost 5 years ago, as evidenced by its continually-increasing price caused by usage increasing faster than mining production.  Nevertheless, more and more merchants accept it and the number of actual economic transactions is growing.
The fact of real-world bitcoin transaction growth trumps the philosophical position regarding deflation.
If you believe that deflation slows an economy, then please do explain when we might expect the ongoing deflation in the bitcoin economy to start slowing it down?

In the West, a marriage involves a marriage license.  The institution of marriage used to be what you claim, but those days are long gone.  You can deny what it is as much as you want, but the truth remains.  You can feel however you want, but marriage in the West is legally a for-profit business arrangement.
Which, by the way, is how the government has the right to determine things like post-divorce visitation rights.  The business contract (marriage license) is actually between three parties; the two spouses and the government.  The government takes a senior position, and therefore calls the shots on the fruit of the marriage when the two spouses cannot agree.
If you think a pre-nup is dangerous ground, try floating the idea of marriage without a marriage certificate.

Bitcoin is a nerd thing.  You have to be pretty adept at computers, and pretty comfortable trusting encryption, both of which are largely the domain of more youthful populations.

I'm...not sure what you are trying to say, here.
You have outlined a conflict between individualism and authoritarianism, but have abandoned the comparison to collectivism?
I think authoritarian societies -- of any kind -- are pretty much always a very bad idea, with extremely limited exceptions such as aboard ships.
"Communism," as practiced in Russia and in every major political arena around the world that I am aware of, is little more than unbridled authoritariansim.  It has very little to do with either socialism or communism.
My gauge is how they treat civilian gun ownership.  Marx strongly approved of gun ownership in the hands of the working class; in fact, he believed it was utterly necessary in both the revolutionary stages and after the communist State had been established.
If a communist government seeks to restrict firearms ownership, it is not communist.  It is authoritarian, and must be removed as quickly as possible before somebody gets badly hurt.
But now I have digressed from the original point.

I think maybe you are not aware of the situation, which is perhaps why it doesn't make sense.
Here's a start; the CFTC granted special letters of exception to JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and others, allowing those companies to short as if they were mining companies.  In other words, JPM can short the market indefinitely without having to prove they either (a) have metal or (b) have the resources to obtain enough metal to fulfill the contracts.   This allows indefinite market suppression, nothing secret about it.

It depends on your appetite for risk.  I'm sure it will have its ups and downs.  I only recently bought in (around 26), but I expect to take losses (on paper) here and there.  It appears that BitCoin is becoming a serious contender as a major disruptive technology, and I feel that it has a lot of room to grow.
Do your reading, and figure out how much risk you want to expose yourself to.  I certainly wouldn't recommend investing anything other than play money.
Some people will say that the ceiling is well into 100s or 1000s.  If BitCoin is adopted by any country or geopolitical unit, even a small one, yes, the value of BitCoins will increase dramatically.  I happen to think this will be the case, as fiat currencies appear to be doomed all around the world.
Other people consider it foolishness.
Do your own research, don't invest anything you are not prepared to completely lose in an instant.

I agree with you generally, but I feel that we are in a huge bubble for the past few weeks.  If it pops at $500, it's going to drop pretty hard below current prices.  On the other hand, if it pops at $1,000 or $1,400 then purchases today are still a pretty good price.

I'm sorry, but you are blind to fact.  The examples you used are from failing currencies being inflated to destruction by their totalitarian governments.
Much like the US currency is being inflated, but velocity is still too low to notice (yet).
Bitcoin is not inflationary.  It is, admittedly, undergoing a continuous inflation for a while, but it tapers off mathematically.  It is deflationary, as many armchair and academic economists are fond of pointing out.
Totally different animal.  There is no bank or government backing bitcoin, teetering on destruction.
Furthermore, you are evidently unaware of the security mechanisms that merchants (and buyers) can use to protect themselves from volatility.  I suggest you read up on how BitPay and CoinBase actually work.  It is possible to almost completely insulate yourself against these types of fluctuations, for both buyer and seller.
Does volatility make it more difficult to use?  Sure, but that doesn't seem to be slowing its adoption.  You should ask them why they are using it if it is wildly unstable, if you don't like my answers.

There's a giant one that nobody else likes to touch: inflation vs. deflation.  Austrian economics holds that inflation is bad, and is the cause of crashes and depressions.  The corollary would also be true: deflation is good.
Personally, I think we will be proving the theory that deflation is good with Bitcoin over the next several years.  If the current spike turns sigmoidal instead of crashing off an exponential cliff, I think that will be a pretty good indicator that the Austrian thoughts concerning deflation are correct.

It has as much to do with Communism as it does Capitalism.  In essence, only the parts of each that most lend themselves to authoritarian corruption.
There is no capitalist or communist presence in politics today, as far as I can tell.  Both "sides" in American politics have devoted themselves to pillage and plunder.

While true, I think there are a lot of people with very immediate needs that have yet to be answered.  BitCoin is not a mature marketplace yet.  Once it becomes mature, with all the trappings of a mature marketplace (credit and derivatives in particular), then it will be more challenging to create services.  Right now, there is huge demand for just the basic elements of a normal economy.

Indeed it was.  So were (most) pirate ships.  in fact, pirate ships were often pure democracies.
This principle is why the US is *not* a democracy.

Massachusetts is a really terrible place for gun owners.  Possessing even a spent cartridge without a firearms permit is a felony.  Even "bullet belts" or "bullet jewelry" is felony-in-possession, and they DO prosecute for these.

Except that most other countries, include Japan, do not have regulatory hurdles like the US.  Regardless, Mt Gox is still (quite legally) accepting bank wires from US customers.  What regulatory hurdles do you feel they need to surpass in order to continue doing business as they are?

So far, the best response to a drop in value is to hold.  Frankly, if you cost average, there has never been a drop in value.
Your criticism is based on ignorance.

Hey man, looks pretty sweet. I've been running a bot for a few months now, and there are a lot of surprising little glitches that can cost you money pretty quickly.
First and most importantly, you need to check for lag before placing orders.  Otherwise, you can have some...surprising...fills.  :)
P.S. what the f is up with all the trolls on bitcointalk.com?  Jeebas.

You asked me a philosophical question, I gave you a philosophical answer.
There is no reason to believe bitcoin will live that long.  There is no reason to believe bitcoin will end sooner.  There is plenty of reason to believe that governments will pit themselves in stark opposition to it.  There is plenty of reasons to believe that governments will fail in this endeavor.
There is no reason to believe that the struggle will end governments, but there is at least one ideological path wherein that could realistically occur.

I don't know what *he* means by that, but there is a lot of liquidity in the form of cash on corporate books.  All that money being printed by the big governments of the world hasn't entirely gone to fill the capital destruction caused by collapsing loans.

Not necessarily.  As a buyer, your contract is with the exchange, not JPM.  A couple years ago, TOCOM changed their rules to allow delivery of a paper instrument in place of physical metal, if they desired.  No crash ensued, so apparently nobody really cared.
You are only a rule change away from getting paper instead of metal in fulfillment of the contract.
Have you ever read up on how the Hunt brothers were stopped?
You are correct, of course; if enough people demand delivery, the sham collapses.  But that is a purely hypothetical "if", and one that nobody with lots of money wants to try.  I wouldn't, if I had enough money to try it.  The reality is that the market is breaking, as evidenced by the disconnect between market spot and off-market prices.  This is the actual solution to the problem; the development of an off-market pricing scheme.
This is where bitcoin comes into play, in my opinion.  We leave Big Finance to play their little fiat games while the rest of us make a decent living earning (and spending) bitcoin.

Could be.  I am pretty ignorant of how money transfers in other countries, outside of wires or Western Union (blech).

Sure, but they are already making money on the API orders because they don't have to serve HTML or images for API orders.  And, honestly, it is not *that* hard to write a screen scraper to place orders through the front-end UI.  So if there is a fee for API orders, it is easily escaped.  Of course they could add a Captcha, but at that point, other exchanges become very attractive.
Here's the giant one that pretty much ensures they will not have fees for API orders: arbitration.  Bots handle arbitration.  By putting extra fees for API orders, MtGox reduces their market parity, and will be subject to even more extreme swings of volatility.

Yes, that is a big issue with chargebacks.  Of course, in BitCoin, every transaction is public, so proving delivery is simple (in theory).

While you are right, they seem to forget about the fact that public opinion can cause 1000x inflation in day if people suddenly decide to get out of dollars, which makes their definition of inflation rather difficult to manage for anything more than academic pursuits.  Perhaps I am mistaken in this.

All Android phones and tablets are Linux under the skin.
Also, Google runs on Linux (largely, there are exceptions).
Many websites run on Linux-based webservers.  Facebook, for example, runs on Linux.

Very reasonable price considering the rampant buyer fraud (fake and stolen accounts, usually) that eBay continues to ignore, and the insane fees they charge.
Edit: if you think it is so unreasonable, try selling some on eBay yourself.  The profit potential is extreme, if the proces are truly unreasonably high.

Who else thinks bitcoin spells a peculiar death knell for most organized crime?  The Silk Road makes drug cartels obsolete, and monetary theft becomes a lot harder when it becomes difficult to figure out who even has bitcoin, let alone how to extract it from them.
