The whole idea behind tether is that they claim they are holding one USD for every one USDT. Take that away and tether is nothing.

In an actual audit, there is a lot more independent verification that needs to take place to make sure that they aren't trying to pull some sort of bamboozle with the auditing firm.
This report was order by Tether **for Tether**. So there are certain things that the report assumes they tell the truth about. For example:
On page 4, in note 2 it clearly says that the accounting firm cannot vouch whether Tether Ltd actually has access to the accounts that contain some of the money. The account was not held in the name of Tether Ltd.

They might have dug themselves too deep already and figured they should have the presses running hot before taking it all and fleeing. There is nothing to say that they have complied with the subpoena already and are back to business as usual.
Can you say that you aren't the least bit worried that the printing of tether [seemingly exploded]( **right** after the subpoena? Combine that with that they consistently fail to get audited (the September report wasn't actually an audit), offering only bullshit responses in request to doing so?

They are selling for $1 each only because Tether (the company) claims to be holding $1 for each USDT. In theory, Tether should have enough liquidity to give everyone back their dollars when they sell them back their tethers. But if Tether doesn't have the liquidity they claim then people will not be able to get back their money.


You are not allowed to sell something under while misrepresenting the circumstances. If you sell USDT while knowing that it doesn't have the liquidity it is claimed to have, you would be committing fraud.

You are selectively selecting one circumstance which might affect the topology positively. You are ignoring that
* Testnet users are enthusiast and having a large number of channels open allows you to explore the network better.
* On the mainnet, you have to actually dedicate your own money to open up the channel. On testnet everything is free.
* The fewer users there are, the larger the likelihood that you need to open up a direct channel to your recipient. When the network increases, simple math tells us that the number of channels per user should decrease.
* The average person on mainnet is less tech savy than the average person on testnet. The vast majority will just use an exchange/service (if one ever implements LN) and they would be incentivized to rout the payment through the hub they will surely be operating themselves.

That's the dollar price, not the bitcoin price. In a store which only accepted bitcoins, a 1BTC item would on average have been priced at 0.7BTC last month, and 16.25BTC a year ago. This is what people mean when they say bitcoin is too unstable to be used as a currency.

1 out of 1000? You should redo that math. If you timed Amazon just right a $1 investment would be worth around $127 today. If you didn't time it right but bought during the decline you would maybe have around $40. 
If you equally invested in 39 companies that went bankrupt plus amazon then 17 years later you would break even. Not compared to the index. No, as in after 17 years you would have recuperated your losses. If you invested in Amazon plus 9 others that completely failed, you would have gotten a 400% return of investment. About the same as NASDAQ since the crash.

There are many different causes for inflation, most of which follow each other closely and can be more less active at any time. Saying wages always trail inflation, or even that they do so most of the time is just false.


But on average, they will need to decrease salaries over time in a deflationary currency. You might get an apparent pay raise because they didn't lower your wages, but it would be exactly like people getting a raise higher than inflation today.

"Simultaneous" would imply that the funds you used to relay the transaction would be refunded to you soon after the transfer. It seems however that these funds can stay locked for a long time, until the final recipient chooses to redeem them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:30:17


This is what I also originally thought. The way they usually explain it is that the end recipient needs to spend their transaction before the nodes can claim their payment. Now, I think that if the end recipient cooperates and tells everyone in the transfer chain that she received the money (sends them her secret key) they can unlock their locked funds.
You however run the risk of lockup if the transaction gets stuck down the line from you for example if another node messes up or the end recipient cannot be reached. If I recall correctly this will take 14 days to unlock and will require closing the channel. 


I think so. If you are opening channels to facilitate other peoples payments, you would at least want to recuperate the fees you paid for opening the channels.


Big hubs are also the most likely to have the funds necessary to split them among many channels and also the ones who can eat up the fees lost from having their funds locked up for a while.


People are saying that channels can stay open indefinitely, but I don't see how. If one of the parties become unresponsive, the other party needs a way to get their owed money back from the channel, thus you create a time lock so that even if you close the channel unilaterally you can get your money back after a certain amount of time. This is a safety mechanism this also makes it so that after a certain amount of time, you would be able to broadcast an earlier transaction where you had more money than you have now, since the time lock for it is now unlocked. That puts an expiry date on the whole channel. I haven't been able to find any information on how to circumvent that and have them open forever.

The problem is that you have to assume a fully cooperating network. You can't assume that in a trustless and anonymous environment.  Even if Carol cries foul instantly, there is nothing Alice can do about it. If I recall correctly, the default lock time (TTL) for the routed funds is 14 days. Alice needs to wait 14 days before she is sure that Carol actually didn't receive the funds, thus releasing her from her promise to pay Bob. 
This leads me to an interesting thought. I must confess that I haven't searched much about this issue except for just now, so this might be one of the things that are elegantly solved. But, what would happen if Alice pays Carol for coffee and routes it through Bob and Carol claims that she never received the funds? If Alice sends a new transaction, Carol have received both and spend them twice. If they just wait out the time it takes for the lock to open, the coffee will be rather cold. 
Edit: I guess Carol could send back a transaction through the network using the original hashlock + a new hashlock generated by Alice. If Carol then spends the first transaction that she claimed she never got, Alice could also spend her "refund" transaction. But what if Alice claims she never got the *refund* transaction.. hmmm!

@_date: 2017-12-15 17:20:51
Thank you very much for that link, I hadn't read it and it was very insightful. However it also describes the same scenario as I am describing:






The first scenario here is what I am describing. Carol, or in this case Yolo can use the fact that Alice doesn't know who is stalling the transaction in order to convince Alice to send a new valid transaction. If this is done before the first transaction expires Carol can cash both.
The safe thing to do would be to wait for the first transaction to expire, but that can significantly impact every day usage.

Of course! Just don't get caught up to bad in all the hype. Depending on how strictly you define what a blockchain is, applications are already plentiful, many predating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:00:29
Because it is a way to swindle people out of money. If someone sends you a transaction through someone else you can claim that it never reached you. They have no way to verify this and will be forced to send another transaction. If there is no way to refund the first transaction before it expires, you now have two transactions that are valid and that you can cash.

An important thing to note here is that if the coffee costs 1 BTC (exclusive stuff). 
You then need to have at least 1 BTC reserved in the channel between you and your buddy and more importantly he/she needs to have 1 BTC free in his/her channel with Exclusive Coffee Shop Inc. Your buddy wont get the BTC back to do other things with until the channel between you and your buddy is closed.

Yeah I agree that it might be the best solution.. Do we know anything about how the fee structure of LN? It feels like it will be proportional to the current transaction fees on the main blockchain, as it requires two transactions to open and close the channel. If the fee will remain high after LN is operational, I think you can still extract a pretty large fee for acting as a node. 
I know LN is supposed to lower the fees on the main blockchain, but looking over the [incoming transactions]( (so mesmerizing) most are like $1000 &gt;. These are hardly the ones that will be supplemented by the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:37:52
If you transact with someone exactly once and never you will probably be better off to send it on-chain.
The hope I think is that it will remove some of the congestion on the blockchain when smaller and frequent transactions are moved off-chain. That *could* make it cheaper for you to do the one-off on-chain transactions.
However, you might also have a route to the person through another open channel you have. That could also be a possibility for sending money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:48:41


It is not separate. The number one reason for why most mining is located in China is due to low energy costs.


Higher amount of electricity used in the process would only equal increased security if everyone was mining individually. This is not the case. Due to the staggering energy costs, mining is unprofitable for individuals. It is only profitable for mining pools and mining pools are bad for security. 
Security was much higher before the explosive energy demand. Now, you constantly see blocks being consecutively mined by the same pools, making it possible for them to game the system if they wanted to. That would be impossible when energy costs still made it feasible for individuals to mine.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:15:02

It is not really that clear cut. Ultimately the power needed to mine one bitcoin will depend on the value of the coin. The difficulty is automatically adjusted so that one block (currently = 12.5 BTC + transactions) is on average mined every 10 minutes, regardless of the amount of power put into mining the block. 
If the value goes up, it is more profitable to mine the block, thus the amount of power you can spend on it while still making a profit increases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:39:47
I don't know if this would be a dangerous precedent but: What if everyone just stopped accepting bitcoins from these hacks? Since they can be tracked forever, that would be certainly be possible. It would suck for the people who for example subsequently bought them from exchanges that accept them but on the other hand, it also sucks for the people that get hacked. Hacks would be much less profitable then. 
If exchanges started leading the way on this, I suspect others would (be forced to) follow. Exchanges are after all the ones who stand the most to loose from the hacks (if they aren't doing it themselves that is..)

As a tech interested person I am with you, but you have to understand that most people don't understand the tech behind it.
To them, they don't care if it is the blockchain that gets hacked or a private key that gets stolen. They only care if their money is safe or not.
The obvious solution of course is to not entrust anyone else with your coins or your keys. For the time being however, that is probably beyond many users, especially the recent influx.

One heavily contested example is the versioning system .git, though a lot of people will rightfully scream at me for saying so.
It makes more sense if we divide the blockchain into two features:
* A record where every block points to it's predecessor (e.g. in the form of Merkle trees)
* A (distributed) consensus mechanism to determine what gets added to the record.
Examples like git possess the first feature, but not so much of the second (outside of centralized user permissions, social contracts etc). The second feature however is what allows anonymous users on the internet to come to the consensus that a record is in a particular order.
Now, on to a rant about the current hype.
[rant about unrelated things]
There are a lot of start-ups claiming they are working on blockchain technology, many of which claim to be using decentralized consensus mechanisms like Bitcoin. What these often fail to adress however is why the consensus need to be decentralized. 
I recently read about tracking business-2-business delivery on a blockchain for example. These are not anonymous entities dealing with each other over the internet. If these cannot form a consensus without resorting to some contrived distributed mechanism, then a blockchain won't solve the problem. 
I suspect however that most are just talking about having an immutable record of transactions/logs/events etc. If that is the case, they are mostly spicing up old technology with new buzzwords.

@_date: 2017-12-14 22:47:10
Thanks, but that is not the issue. The issue is that Alice will reserve these funds for Bob while waiting for the receipt from Carol. Up until the transaction expires (14 days I *think*) Alice cannot know if Carol will suddenly pull out the receipt forcing her to pay Bob and Bob to pay Carol. Thus, if there is a dispute whether funds were received or not, I hope there is a way to not have to wait out the 14 days for the dispute to be settled. The coffee will be very cold by then.

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:18:53
The problem is that Alice cannot know if Bob sent the funds to Carol or not. She will send him a hash-locked transaction that will unlock only when Carol broadcasts her transaction from Bob (proving that she did indeed receive the funds). 
Until then, Alice cannot simply act like Bob has provided Carol with the funds, because she doesn't know for sure if he has.

They don't just overlap, they are completely contradicting to each other.
You are still saying that having a high hashrate/using much energy is good for security but as I pointed out previously, this is ONLY true if that hashing power is being spread across many different individuals. 
Security is granted if the chance of any one player finding multiple consecutive blocks is very small. If we have a large amount of players doing individual mining this will of course cost a lot of energy but it will give us security at the same time. This is NOT what we are seeing and it is BECAUSE of the massive amount of energy making it impossible for smaller players to stay in the game.
What we have now is 4 pools that control mines more than 50% of all blocks. They could increase their energy consumption by to the total energy consumption of the world and it STILL wouldn't add any extra security, it would just serve to kick off the smaller players and lower security more.

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:25
That sounds good on paper but not in reality. Energy usage has skyrocketed while security has diminished. 80% of mining comes out of large pools in China, how is that for decentralization?
Problems will only increase in the future as higher adoption means more pending transactions, more transactions means that the miners can take out an higher fee, a higher fee means that there you can use more energy and still be profitable. This in turn favors large mining pools, especially in countries like China where the margins can be higher.
That is why we absolutely need to look at solutions like LN.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:51
Sorry to hear that! But you are right, maybe they will learn it the hard way.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:18:21
I could be worse in the use case. I think there are possible ways that the LN could evolve where it is useful for a one-time micro-transaction (through another open channel). I know people have been making different models trying to understand how the network could evolve, but there are to many unknowns to say anything conclusively. 
Side note, to me, this is the most exiting stuff. No-one knows for sure what kind of network structures will form, will there be a large central hub, hubs and spokes, small islands, circles? What will the associated fees be, how will they scale? No one knows for sure and that is AWESOME. Its like an organism, but its a computer protocol.

I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is broken. Seems pretty cool regardless.
One thing I noted is that the video says that both parties sign every transaction. I am 99% sure this is completely wrong^1 . If they both signed it, it would mean that they could close it at any time but you would have to trust the other party not to close an earlier transaction. Bob would get free coffee if he chooses to broadcast the first transaction after another one had been made.

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:42:44
This video says that both parties add their signatures to the transaction. I am pretty sure that isn't true. The coffee-shop adding its signature to the transaction would make it possible for Bob to close it.
For example:
* Bob deposits 10 mBTC
* Bob pays 1 mBTC for a coffee (signs a transaction that provides bob with 9 mBTC and the coffee-shop with 1 mBTC)
* Bob again pays 1 mBTC for a coffee (signs a transaction that provides bob with 8 mBTC and the coffee-shop with 2 mBTC)
If the coffee shop had signed the second or first transaction, that would mean that Bob could broadcast one of those to the network essentially getting one or two cups of free coffee.
If Bob wants to close the channel, he asks the coffee-shop to sign the lightning transactions and they will (if the cooperate) sign the last one.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:59:55
It seems like you know a fair bit about this, so feel free to correct me but: From what I have read, the smart contract part only keeps Carol from being able to spend Bobs funds without also revealing to Bob how to spend Alice's funds. In that case, Bob will automatically get the receipt. Now, this part of the contract would only be executed once Carol broadcasts her transaction to the main blockchain.
If that was the only mechanism then both Alice's and Bob's funds would be locked waiting for Carol to cash in. A more civil way of resolving things is if Carol immediately upon getting the transaction from Bob gives him the 'receipt' which he also shows to Alice. That way, everyone in the network can continue with the knowledge that the funds have been transmitted. As far as I can tell, this last part of the process is not governed by the smart contract, but instead relies on everyone in the network playing nice. 
If someone isn't cooperating, Alice cannot know who it is that isn't cooperating. If she can't get a refund for her original transaction before it expires, she can't know if she can dare send a second transaction to Carol. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:17:57
Pretty sure that isn't entirely true. Any party can *request* that the channel is closed, but the other node has to cooperate. Otherwise you need to wait for the time-lock to open. 
Also, if you relay funds through your channel, the relayed transaction will be hash-locked. As far as I understand it, these funds can't be redeemable until the final recipient redeems his/her new funds. 
That means if you close your channel before that, you will be forfeiting your ability claim back the funds that you have relayed.

You could add that to the chart, but it wouldn't make even less sense then the original chart comparison (as others have pointed out in the thread).

It would, of course, be subjected to the jurisdiction of the country the company is operating in. If you live in the US and own a bitcoin that can't be spent in the US, you are not going to be consoled by the fact that it can be used in Venezuela or whatever. You'd have to trade it away with someone who could actually use it in their country, significantly lowering the value of the "tainted" coin.
The US accounts for an overwhelming majority of all bitcoin usage. Any legislation in the US will significantly affect bitcoin, whether we like it or not. Also, it is not at all uncommon for such financial regulations to be synced across many countries. In fact, there already exists intergovernmental organizations that handle things like this, for example, just look at the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.

What the hell are you on about? That is a point you made up just now. And missing out is not the same as being actively hurt by something. If a major part of our economy would shift to bitcoin, poor people would likely be last people in and thus the biggest losers. I agree with your sentiment that it would become a huge migration of wealth, probably something along the lines we have never seen before. What I disagree with is the implication that this migration will be something positive.


About as many as the number of poor people who benefited from the rise of Bitcoin. Why do you think people who can't afford to invest in stocks would suddenly be able to afford to invest in Bitcoin?
You might wonder why I feel so strongly about this. Imagine all the people with all their savings in securities tied to fiat, pensions, college funds you name it. You think these people are just going to accept to buy into a system where their savings have become practically worthless. 
All this "Lambos! To the Moon! We will become the new upper class." and shit will end up hurting Bitcoin adoption in the end. The more it is used to shake up the current economic situation, the less accepted it will become by the masses. If we want adoption, we need people to chill the heck down and start evangelizing for the technology, not for get-rich-quick schemes. We need slow and organic growth, not rockets to the moon.

As soon as you actually want to spend your bitcoin on something it is no longer censorship resistant. Every company, exchange, bank etc. that accepts bitcoin can be forced to not accept bitcoin whose origin is determined as invalid. If bitcoin is to be actually used in the real world, it becomes a technology attached to companies with bank accounts.
You can't go into a store and buy something with a marked bill. The exact same could happen to bitcoin. Sure, there is nothing stopping you from trading it anonymously, just as you can hand a marked bill to someone else, but it becomes almost worthless if it is not accepted for goods and services in some major countries.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:54:01

Yes but that transaction or any derivatives of that transaction would never be valid in a US (or any other participating counties) exchange, making them inherently less valuable than other coins.

Usage =/= trading volume. While Japan is making huge transactions, it is mostly for speculation. I maintain that the biggest usage of bitcoin comes from the US. 
Most of the [big merchants accepting bitcoin]( are located in the US, [a majority of all Bitcoin ATMs]( are located in the US, etc. 
But it doesn't even matter, if it is the US, EU, Japan that is the biggest user. All of them have worked together on against money laundering before, adopting similar legislation. Would it be such a crazy idea that they might do so again?

It would only taint other bitcoin if people choose to accept them in the first place. It wouldn't require some advanced technical analysis to track, it is essentially the same kind of analysis every node does every time they validate whether an utxo in a transaction is valid or not.

When I say "accepting" I mean in the sense of accepting the transaction as a payment for goods and services. It is the same as if you throw marked bills at a cashier and run away without any goods, they haven't accepted the marked bills as a means of payment.
In the case of bitcoin, there is nothing forcing the recipient to even acknowledge the transaction. You never have to spend that utxo if you don't want to, there is nothing that mixes it with the rest of your supply if you don't want to.
Sure, currently a wallet software wouldn't make the distinction, but if a law like this would go into effect it would be trivial to implement.

I can guarantee you that poor people own a minuscule percentage of the total bitcoin volume. People generally follow the smart advice of not investing more than they can afford to lose. The poorer you are, the smaller the percentage of your net worth that you can afford to lose is. Poor people might have had the chance to win big if the had ignored that but the same can be said about lottery tickets. Lottery tickets can allow a poor person to become rich, that doesn't mean that it empowers poor people.

Not entirely, with LN you could route a payment through another node you are running yourself and stall the transaction. You can show the merchant that the transaction was sent but not yet received. They will have to trust that they will get it eventually (essentially same as 0 confirmation).
They won't be able to tell that you own the node that is holding up the transaction. Wait long enough you will get the money back.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:55:40
