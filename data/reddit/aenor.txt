If you can identify who owns the addresses, yes you can.
So say coins are stolen from a proven mintpal address (they declare and prove the address is theirs).  It then gets transferred to another address - perhaps they sent it to another address they own themselves. Perhaps they buy something from you, and send something to your address - you are in receipt of stolen money. Which is a crime - and a crime easier to prove with bitcoin than with old-fashioned cash.

@_date: 2014-05-16 16:04:22
+1 Doge to the rescue - transaction fee is about 1 DOGE which is just 0.000001BTC, compared to Bitcoin's transaction fee of 0.0001BTC.
Plus it's inflationary so people don't mind spending it. I think things will evolve so that Bitcoin is an investment or commodity like gold to be held for saving and Doge will be a currency actually used in daily life.

P.S. By accepting the coin for council tax, it defacto becomes a real currency. The world's first crypto you can use to pay taxes?
The other interesting thing in the article is the council stressing that it's tax free as long as it is not sold on exchanges for cash (hence triggering capital gains tax). So this might be the first crypto designed to actually be spent on food and rent.

After the 2011 crash (from $30 to $3) it stayed down for over a year. Luckily back then people weren't margin trading - they'd have gotten wiped out long before the price recovered.
The market might stay down for a year or two years even. This is a long term thing. You urgently need to find some cash to pay those margin calls if you are going to survive this. Don't just sit there hoping it will turn next month - you'll just be like a frog being slowly boiled alive.

Well in theory, the Moolah escrow *was* an independent third party. The Syscoin devs were raising money from investors for their coin. The investors decided to use moolah as escrow. They sent the money - and it wasn't forwarded on. (I think the Syscoin devs have initiated a lawsuit). The investors would have been better off sending coins directly to the Syscoin devs because they knew who they were.
Basically any transaction requires trust - and there is a conflict between some bitcoiners glorification of privacy, and establishing trusted third parties to verify transactions, because trust requires transparency. 
It will have to get resolved one way or another. But as long as people in a position of trust say "I refuse to let you see my face, and I refuse to disclose details of my life" as Moolah did - and the community accepts this because they've been sold on the idea of privacy being more important than security, including the privacy of the guy they've trusting with their coins, you are going to get scammers moving in to exploit them.

Quote from article:


The unprecedented move is a bid to “tackle poverty” and boost the local economy. Struggling residents will carry out "voluntary work" and receive HullCoins as payment. These digital coins could then be used to pay rent or council tax, or buy other goods and services such as fruit and vegetables. Council workers are currently investigating whether deals could be signed that would even allow them to be used at highstreet shops such as Asda. Those virtual earnings would not be taxable or affect any existing benefits claims because digital money is not yet treated as traditional currency by HMRC or the Department for Work and Pensions, the council said.
Nice to see local democracy embracing cryptos!

Come now trading is not "what you do best"!!!!!!
You are looking at this all wrong. Taking a job would help your trading because it would decrease your risk.
You appear to have two choices - close all your trades and lose money. Or find some money to cover your margin calls so that you can then afford to wait for the market to turn.
What burns traders is lack of cashflow. So getting that job will give you cashflow.
Again, you asked for help and all you need to do is the following:
1. Get a job
2. Use money from job to pay those margin calls
3. Stop using leverage - it makes you poor
4. Learn risk management - only stake 5% of your money on bitcoin
5. Once you've paid your margin and therefore you own all those coins, transfer them to an offline wallet and don't look at them for three years. By that time you'll finally be rich.
Or you could ignore all the above, have your trades forcibly closed and lose the lot.
Your choice.

My advice - get a job so you have income coming in. Stop doing the margin stuff - leverage magnifies your risk. Use the income from your job to meet the margin calls, transfer the bitcoins to an offline wallet and then just leave them there for a couple of years and get on with your life in the meanwhile.

Bitcoiners agree in the way they behave. They treat bitcoin like gold - which is property rather than currency.

The majority of Dogecoiners are teenagers who thought that because Moolah donated to charity that meant he was "good". 
This saga has been part of their education and graduation to the adult world to learn that scammers tend to exploit people's black-and-white views of what constitutes "good". (Moolah wasn't the first crook to use charity to get some of the community onside - Al Capone famously set up soup kitchens so that part of the community would question whether he was really bad, and would hesitate to turn him in).

The blockchain is a public ledger. Bitcoin is not anonymous, but instead pseudonymous - you can see which addresses the coins were transferred from, but unless you know who owned those addresses, you can't prove anything.
In this case, we know who owns the source address - Mintpal. Therefore we can track where the missing 3700 coins went. Seems they were sent to a known bitstamp address. Therefore, if you know who owns the source address and who owns the end address, you can see who sent coins to whom. In this case, stolen coins from mintpal were sent to bitstamp.
P.S. The FBI has previously testified that bitcoin's public ledger makes it easier for them to track theives than traditional cash. For example, the way they tracked Silk Road money was making  purchases, and once they had a bitcoin address from a self-confessed silk road vendor, bitcoin's public ledger made it a piece of cake to track the vendor down.

Sign up pages are too complex because I don't really want to inconvenience my good customers just because they thieves with adblock want something for free.
Here's the thing: the following site produced some javascript that would allow a website owner to block users who had adblock with a polite pop up that told them to go elsewhere.
The adblockers then added code to **circumvent** the javascript that was blocking them from viewing the page.
Think about that for a minute: the customer says, "I don't want ads, and if you don't want me, just put a 'GTFO if you won't follow my rules' sign on your website and I'll go away".
The website owner does just that - and the customer then gets an ad-blocker that *breaks* the javascript - because contrary to what the customer said before, they *do* want to see your content and use your bandwidth even if you've told them to go away  - i.e. their "noble" principles amount to the fact that these are a bunch of entitled thieves who don't respect webmasters and don't want to pay and don't want to view ads either.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:56:45


Actually it's the other way around. The content maker didn't force you to go to their site - YOU WENT TO THEM. You forced your way onto THEIR website. 
By loading their website, you are consuming not only their content, but their bandwidth (which is not free, they have to pay for it) and the cost of their domain (which is also not free, they have to pay for it).
Your argument is like a man who goes into a supermarket, takes some apples off the shelf and then says "You are showing me a bill without giving me a choice". Actually, you did have a choice - you had the choice of not going into the supermarket in the first place.
You have a choice about not seeing ads - don't visit sites on the net, just go back to buying newspapers.
But don't bleat about how you have the right to force your way onto a website uninvited and have the right to consume someone's bandwidth and content without seeing ads or paying.
What is it about some people who think they have the right to someone else's property without their permission?

It's not a direct crime - but the money has to be returned to the rightful owner. 
For example - take the art stolen by the Nazis. Some museums and galleries bought it from the thieves in good faith. But it still had to be returned to the rightful owners.
A system where someone can take stuff illegally and they don't have to give it back to the rightful owners, is a system run for the benefit of criminals.
The law as it currently stands distinguishes between knowingly and unknowingly receiving stolen property. The former is a criminal offence, the latter is not. In this case, coins went from a *known* mintpal address to a *known* ryan kennedy address to a *known* bitstamp address. No innocent parties in the middle. If bitstamp were alerted about this, and still accepted the coins, they are knowingly receiving stolen coins. 
Yet we have a lot of people on this thread arguing that they should not do anything, that they should allow moolah to cash out to fiat (which is genuinely untraceable). Makes you wonder doesn't it?
I would say that lots of criminals have migrated into bitcoin precisely because they think it is a system that is run for their benefit. Some of them are probably posting on this thread (moolah's sock-puppets?). "Bwah, wah, wah, this is *dreadful*, how can I make my living as a thief and hacker if the blockchain is tracking everything and I have to give it all back. This is not the criminals paradise I thought it was, I've been conned." etc etc. :-)

When I first got into bitcoin, I joined bitcointalk.org, and back then they put you into a newbie section, where you had to accrue a number of posts before you got to post elsehwhere.
I spent most of my initial posts asking questions - there were a bunch of veterans who patrolled the newbie section - and I learnt so much! About wallets, safety, the fee structure, trading and so on.
That's all gone now - no newbie section on bitcointalk and some noobs don't even know that forum exists. There's nowhere for noobs to go for advice - and they often end up on cheerleading threads on reddit instead and are vulnerable to being scammed basically.
The community has changed and veterans arn't as helpful to noobs as they used to be. Instead they are impatient and scorn them for not understanding in 5 minutes what it took the veteran several months to learn...

The other difference between bitcoin and dogecoin is that doge is inflationary, and the way it's denominated means people don;t need to use fractions of decimals to pay for things, they can do it in whole coins.

Localbitcoins is decentralised - but you a) pay eye-watering premiums over the exchange price and b) there are loads of scammers hanging out there.
The exchanges are cheaper and safer (yes I know gox and moolah happened, but the scams on teh exchanges are fewer than on localbitcoins).
The current eco-system allows you to go down the privacy and anonymity route if you want, as long as you pay the extra price. 
But it seems some people want to have their cake and eat it too - they want anonymity *and* the safety that comes with transparency, and their brains can't get round the fact that anonymity and transparency are opposites...

Not correct. That link above showed how the website owner could add some javascript that produced a pop up telling the user to go away because they had adblock. 
The adblockers then produced code to **break** the javascript so they could still view the page.
In other words they were forcing a page that *wasn't* publicly accessible, to be shown. Classic thieves.

Also anonymity is a godsend for crooks. Alex Green/Moolah's schtick was "invest in me, but respect my privacy and don't ask questions about my identity". Turns out that's because if you asked about his identity you would find out he was a proven scammer.
Lots of the people pushing anonymity for businesses thing are scammers themselves hoping to persuade a guillible community that it's in their interests not to know who they were doing business with.
Also - when the community self-polices, it's notable that a certain group protests about it. So when people on bitcointalk tracked the missing mintpal coins to bitstamp on the blockchain and alerted bitstamp about it, there was *outrage* on reddit. In redditors opinion, it violated Moolah's privacy (if bitstamp matched the coins to all the KYC stuff they had on the receivers account, they'd be able to identify him to the police) and he should have been allowed to cash his stolen coins into fiat and disappear (because fiat is so much more anonymous!).
It really makes you wonder about the people pushing "anonymity at all costs". It's not a sensible position to be on the side of a thief who has stolen $1.5 million - unless you are a scammer yourself and are afraid that you'll get caught if teh community stops it's worship of anonymity. And I'm quite sure all those folk will downvote this comment too.

I agree that criminal types will find this all very worrying indeed because it makes their life much more difficult - and they will end up migrating to the dark coins. 
At the moment though, because lots of people mistakenly believe bitcoin is anonymous rather than pseudonymous, we've had a rush of crims and bad actors into this coin, which has caused all these problems with thefts.
I don't agree that bitcoin will die - less than 5% of any given population are criminals who are angry about bitcoin not being anonymous. The majority of people don't care about anonymity - look how people put their entire lives on Facebook. The main benefit of bitcoin is the low processing fees, not the anonymity (which in any case doesn't exist because the blockchain is public). You can save thousands in fees over the long run, that's the main attraction.
The best thing that can happen for bitcoin is if the criminal class is scared off and chased off into the darkcoins, leaving this coin clean. But that will only happen if their stolen coins are confiscated each time they try to steal. It really needs to *hurt* to get them to leave.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:58:52
In the article they mention there's a pre-mine which they then distribute in return for work done.  
They're warning people against cashing in on exchanges (because that would incur a tax - how cool that an elected council is trying to save it's citizens some tax!), asking people instead to use it to buy food and pay rent.
So it's similar to country coins being launched, which also have premines - the difference is that a) it's being launched by elected council members who live in the city instead of scammers from Panama imposing their coin on their chosen destination, b) there is no chance of a pump and dump because they're warning people they'll have to pay tax if they sell it on the exchanges c) if people do want to sell on the exchanges they can, but it's taxable d) they will be able to use it to buy food, pay rent on council houses and pay council tax, which means it will have a bigger "real" economy than bitcoin does. ASDA is the third biggest supermarket in the UK
Point d) is important. Bitpay and Gyft simply convert bitcoin into dollars and pay the retailer dollars - in other words they are the ones using bitcoin as a voucher. This coin would stand on it's own without conversion on an exchange - i.e. a proper currency.

egold *was* a money transmitter. They advertised themselves as such, and their customers were people who were trying to get money to shady places.
Bitcoin isn't like that - the first thing is that the ledger is public. There is nothing hidden or shady. Didn't the FBI testify to Congress that the ledger made it easier to track crims, and that existing laws plus the ledger were all they needed?
And then take the case of all the businesses that "accept" bitcoin - eg Overstock etc. They arn't really receiving bitcoins but instead dollars, the bitcoin acts like a voucher. Is Gyft regulated as a money transmitter or a stock exchange - or has govt recognised that they are just dealing with a set of vouchers - vouchers from the retailers and bitcoin vouchers from the consumers... People who buy and sell vouchers arn't money transmitters but simple ecommerce folk.
If it's the case that Bitcoin exchanges are not money transmitters, there's no need for heavy handed verification of IDs. I've tended to deal with btc-e because they don't require verification. My issue with bitstamp and others requiring copies of passports etc is what if they get hacked - the hacker will get a goldmine of sensitive personal info that could be used for identity theft.

By going to someone's website you are still consuming their bandwidth - that's not about duplication at all, each site has to pay for their own bandwidth.
Likely the owner didn't invite you to their site (they just don't know how to block people with ad-block from loading their site). You forced your way onto to it because you wanted to consume THEIR content and bandwidth. 
So you are in effect saying that you have the right to go someone else's site, use their bandwidth, and their costs incurred by purchasing the domain, plus creating the content - and you are justifying this thievery by making up some nonsense about how in your imagination it's not theft - the domain, the bandwidth, the content all appeared *magically* through "duplication" and hence you have the right to thieve off them because you are so special you don't want to pay and you don't want to be inconvenienced by ads either.

It wasn't meant to be a gotcha :) We're just having a discussion about the possibilities of this IRS ruling.
If you look at exchanges like bitstamp - they too use third parties for the payment - wires from banks etc. But the buying and selling of the digital good known as bitcoin is done by them. they don't themselves transmit money anywhere. 
If it can be established across the board that this is a digital good not money, then it's just ecommerce or the use of vouchers. It simplifies things so much.
I take the point that people have made about different govt agencies not talking to each other. But maybe it's time to lobby politicians to pass a law classing bitcoin as a digital good. Then people can just carry on and trade it back and forth to their hearts content without interference.

Am surprised more alts arn't merge mined - there is benefit to both parties - very secure blockchain for the alt and increased reward to keep mining for the miner.

It doesn't actually.
S&amp;P500 was 1552 in the year 2000
Today it is 2007.84
That is 29% gain over 14 years, which equates to 1.8% per annum. This is not a hypothetical gain - this is what that index **actually returned**.
If you were 18 in 2000 and invested $1000, you'd now have $1290 at age 32. And that's if there are no charges. Factor in an annual charge of 1% per annum, and the return is 11.8% - i.e. $1000 turns into $1118, after 14 long years.  
Those fantastic gains you are quoting? Haven't been seen since the 90's over 20 years ago - but the sales shills are still quoting them as though they are gospel and have been happening ever since.

Doge. Transaction fee on doge is 1 Doge, which is about 55 satoshi. Genuinely cheap compared to the 20,000 satoshi minimum required for btc at the moment.
If you do a lot of transactions, *fees add up*. If you do a thousand transactions with doge, the fees total 55,000 satoshi. 1000 transactions with btc, and the fees total 22,000,000 satoshi or 0.22btc.
Also, doge is great for microtransactions - on several writing sites where there is an option to tip with btc, ltc or doge, people always choose doge because it doesn't cost them a lot in fees.
The only people thinking btc fees are cheap are those who arn't doing many transactions - like OP said, they don't use it as a currency.

Bitcoin has never been anonymous, it's pseudonymous. The blockchain has **always** been public from the word go. That was built into teh protocol - that everyone could **see** what was going on, there's no secrecy unlike in the banking system. If you can link an address to a person somehow (detective work), you can see exactly how the money flows.
Secondly, only the criminal classes want it to be fungible (and lots are masquerading as libertarians). Ever wondered why they kicked up a fuss about BTC-E freezing accounts but not coinbase? That's because those coinbase accounts weren't connected to the crims, but the Btc-E action really threatened their ability to get away with theft. Genuine libertarians of course had no problem with a private entity like Btc-E doing whatever it liked with their exchange - it was self-policing at it's best.
For those of us who are not criminals and not involved in money-laundering, bitcoin is really about lowering fees. Merchants pay through the nose in Visa fees and consumers pay through the nose in bank account fees. For us it's about cutting fees, and being able to move money without using a bank. And that if there is another banking crisis, the govt wont feel the need to use our tax dollars to bail out the system anymore, because there is an alternative payment system up and running (the main reason for the bailout was because of the risk that people wouldn't be able to access their salaries and wouldn't be able to buy food if the banking system shut down). Why do you think western govts have legalised BTC? Because they are contingency planning for another bank shutdown.
But it's a pity the criminal class and all their sock puppets are seeking to hijack bitcoin and trying to force the community to believe that the point of BTC is to allow crims to steal at will and get away with it and any sort of policing (self-policing, govt policing, the public ledger on the blockchain) is evil and has to be shut down.

You can't get an amount that small (0.000001) confirmed - which makes it pointless to pretend that you can send it, doesn't it? As well as misleading to noobs who are told that BTC is endlessly divisible and then find it really isn't in practice.

Well I already use it to transfer money from exchange to exchange, as the withdrawal fees the exchanges charge for BTC are too high. (on cryptsy the withdrawal fee for btc is 100,000 satoshi, whereas it's just 1 doge for withdrawing doge (about 60 satoshi) so it makes sense to convert to doge when transferring out.
Then I discovered that most of the voucher sites in the UK accept doge as well as btc, which makes it easy for me to buy groceries - just transfer the doge straight from the exchange to  and buy vouchers to get groceries. No need to switch the doge back to btc or fiat.
So you see, circumstances and the eco-system mean I'm using my doge more than btc. Which is what leads me to think it might be the winning currency.

Of course a country would invade!!! 
Consider - you've got all that lovely land, you haven't bothered to provide for your defence - so the smart thing for a foreigner to do is invade and COMPEL the idiots with no defence to give them money and land on pain of death! They've got powerful weapons, but you were too cheap to get some of your own. So you'd be toast. 
That's what happened to Britain in 1066. The Normans invaded, and then went on a killing spree murdering and then seizing property. Within 20 years the whole of England was owned by just 110 people. And when there was a rebellion in the north, they ordered what is known as "the harrying of the north", where they simply killed 10% of the population - 100,000 people out of a population of 1 million. That's what happens if you've not bothered to collectively arm yourselves with the latest expensive weaponry but your opponents have. England before the conquest was a patchwork of small kingdoms that pretty much did their own thing.
It's not hard to literally "take over every household". You mention taking over "every police and protection agency" - but remember you have no police or protection agencies - you abolished them because you abolished government. All they need to do is do a Dresden and drop a few bombs (via drones) and simply clear you out! What are you going to do - try to defend yourself against the drone with a shot-gun? It doesn't matter if there is "no tax base to take control of" - they can set one up by simply killing your youngest and if you are still resistant, simply wiping you out completely and giving the land to their own people.
A more recent example: the American invasion of Mexican territory in the 19th century. The Mexicans weren't well armed, and they lost texas, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and California. The Americans didn't say "it's not worth invading because there is no government/weak government" - they said - "Lovely, this gives us a chance to steal land and murder the original inhabitants if they resist".
Why do you imagine governments were formed in the first place?

Priority is about confirmations.
So if there are two transactions, both of which have paid a mining fee of 0.0005, but transaction A has inputs with twice the number of confirmations as transaction B, then A will get processed first, even if it is made five minutes after transaction B.
Basically when each block is mined, they choose the transactions with the highest confirmations in the inputs first.
ETA: It's not the total you are sending "larger transactions" but the number of kilobytes that counts. So if your transaction is made up of a lot of smaller inputs then each will have 180 bytes, and they are added up. So sending 1BTC made up of 1 input will have higher priority than 1BTC sent made up of ten smaller inputs.
@_date: 2013-07-13 06:40:22
Remember there are a LOT of alt coins. So if you have a large amount of coins to move and the litecoin market isn't deep enough, you can just split it into litecoins, devcoins and ppcoins for example. Or any other combination.

@_date: 2013-11-21 16:44:29
Because bitcoin is a digital currency, the fee is based on the number of bytes you are sending. So if you are sending 1BTC made up of ten smaller inputs, the bytes you are sending are larger than 1BTc made up of 1 input.
The system is based on a weighted average of the number of inputs, the value of those inputs and the number of confirmations each input has got.
See the following for a better explanation:
TL;Dr - the longer you leave your coins to mature and gain confirmations, the lower the transaction fees.

Whether you hold your coins on blockchain or in a wallet on your PC, the transaction fees are based on a formula weighting the amount with the number of confirmations.
Therefore if you have low inputs, be patient and let the coins age before sending them, and then you'd have no problems ( the smaller the input the longer you should leave it to age). 
For more info on how the fees are calculated see the following site:
@_date: 2013-07-19 19:38:07
You need to let your coins age before spending (i.e. gain a lot of confirmations). The older the coin the lower the fee. 
Also, because this is a digital currency, the fee is charged based on the number of bytes you are sending, not the overall value.
Therefore a transaction of 0.02BTC which is made up of just one input can be sent with no fees because you are sending just 148 bytes, whereas a transaction of 0.2BTC which is made up of 70 inputs will definitely incur a stiff fee as you are sending over 10,000 bytes.

Part of the reason Germany has accepted bitcoin is because so many commercial businesses in Berlin have adopted it.
No government wants to go up against an entire community that has votes.
However, where bitcoin is used only for speculating and not commerce, it's easy for governments to bash it. After all the majority are quite happy to see a handful of speculators get hammered. Speculating has a bad rep.
There is a lesson in that for other communities. Adopt and use bitcoin and it's harder to get rid of. Once your community has sufficient mass to affect elections, you are invulnerable.

Litecoin's fees are even worse than Bitcoins - a whopping fee of 0.1 for transctions under 0.1. That's there arn't any litecoin faucets.
For microtransactions your best bet is Devcoin. They issue a large amount of coins each block which means that even as the price rises you are still sending whole coins without fees. A devcoin equals 147 satoshis at the moment and you should be able to send without fees

Well ask yourself why some ecommerce websites allow you to pay in euros as well as dollars, or allow you to pay with paypal as well as credit cards - or indeed allow you to pay with bitcoin along credit cards.
It's because the additional choice brings in a different demographic, so they increase their potential market share when they add the choice.
Are the litecoin crowd a different deemographic to the bitcoin crowd? I'd say yes - litecoin miners don't mine bitcoins, and they have hundreds of solo miners (unlike bitcoin which is concentrated in a few hands). So yes it's worth putting on an option for litecoins - you can only find out how big that market is by testing. Be sure to go to the litecoin forums and promote your offering too.
The other thing is that while bitcoin is on the regulatory radar, litecoin isn't. So you are under the radar, so to speak.
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:21:37
It's because your inputs hadn't achieved sufficient priority when you created the transaction. 
Bitcoin requires patience. Wait for your inputs to age before sending. Each input is judged separately. Rule of thumb: if your input consists of 1BTC, you need it to age 1 day before sending. If the input consists of 0.1BTC you need it to age 10 days. If the input is 0.01BTC it needs to age 100 days if you want to send it without fees.
If you want to send BTC sooner than the above ageing process, then you need to include a fee.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the spring spike attracted some hedge fund types, and they are now liquidating in order to get cash to meet their margin calls elsewhere.
In a way it's a good thing if the speculators depart - they ruin things, many a developing country has experienced what happens when "hot money" departs when the speculators get cold feet.

No. What you are describing is asset inflation. In other words the central bank has pumped in so much money into the system that it takes a lot more money to buy the same item, the house.
In places like Singapore and Hong Kong, land is extremely scarce, they've built on everything and reclaimed what they can from the sea and have reached the limits. In those places the scarecity of land pushing up house prices holds true.
But the united states is VAST by contrast. There's enough land to provide ten acres to every citizen, and still have land left over for farming and wildlife reserves. So the rising house prices you describe are down to inflation, not deflation.

Rule of thumb - 1BTC needs to age for a day, 0.1 BTC needs to age for 10 days, 0.01 BTC needs to age for 100 days and so on. There is plenty on Google about priorities and confirmation - Google "bitcoin priority" and read up about it. 
Basically bitcoin is only instant when your "inputs" are whole bitcoins. If your wallet is made up of inputs that are fractions, each fraction needs to be aged before you can combine and send quickly. HTH

The transaction fees are based on the number of kilobytes you are sending and how old they are, not the value of BTC you are sending.
So if your 0.0010 is made up of 100 micro-inputs that are newish (and therefore don't have lots of confirmations), then you'll see a steep charge based on how many kilobytes over 10,000 you are.
See the following post on bitcointalk which explains in exact detail how the fees are calculated:

Something a little like this is done by BTCPak - they switch BTC into Moneypaks. It might be worth you reading the following thread on bitcointalk:
However, your idea looks like its more comprehensive - and it would be lovely if you could make it so international customers could use your service too.

It's alread happened m'dear. What do you think alt-coins are about? All the alt-coins were made by forking the main blockchain.
You can choose an ethically inspired coin with no cap on the coins - devcoin. Or a proof of stake coin (aka interest bearing coin) like PPcoin, or a coin with demurage (freicoin) or a coin with faster confirmations and a higher total issue (litecoin). There's about a 100 more variations. If you are an anarchist an alt-coin may suit you better because the Fed doesn't even know most of them exist - how's that for under the radar?
Plenty of choice out there for everyone. No need for wars or arguments - just vote with your wallet.

So - if your country is invaded, you should have purchased insurance in advance, which would then pay out for your share of the cost of defence? And if your neighbourhood suddenly turns bad, you should have purchased insurance to pay for the security in the good times?
I bet most of the people advocating no-tax systems are too cheap to pay for the insurance. And in many cases they don't foresee the problems in order to arrange insurance in the first place. How many people in Cyprus in the good times were aware that some of their banks would go bust? How many people in Ireland predicted that their economy would go belly up and set aside money to pay for the cost? None.

I hold some Devcoins because I like their philosophy 
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:53:55
No - but then you have the problem of people "free-riding" on other people's insurance.
So say I took out insurance to pay out my share of defence if we got invaded, but you didn't. Unless there was a means to compel you to pay your share, insurance or no insurance, (perhaps seizing your assets to pay your share if you had no insurance), then I'd be carrying you.
Taxes are really a giant insurance pool - instead of being spread over a few thousand they are spread over a few hundred million. the admin costs of taxes are low (about 10%, compared to 30% in insurance companies), and there is of course no need for a profit margin.
If you add up all the insurances you would have to buy to compensate for the lack of a state, and then the cost of taxation in what is a "national" insurance pool, the taxation often works out cheaper. That's why the system is how it is - because the majority have done the calculation...

According to teh rules there are no fees if a) your inputs are aged and have priority b) if you are sending an output of more than 0.01BTC and c) if the inputs that make up your outputs are less than 10,000 kilobytes.
Anyone sending 1BTC should be able to do so without fees as long as it has aged in your wallet for 1 day. If you are sending 0.1BTC it needs to age for 10 days and 0.01BTC it needs to age for 100 days. If your output is made up of lots of small inputs, they take the weighted average for age.

The online poker industry still exists and is making money hand-over-fist - it's just outside of the USA. The global gambling industry is worth $125 billion - see
Makes the $2bn US poker industry look puny doesn't it? 
Bitcoin is a global currency - it was invented by a Japanese bloke! It might be that the US govt will forbid US citizens to buy bitcoins - but the rest of the world will continue to use it. Lots of bitcoin businesses are located outside of America - in Europe (bitstamp), in Russia (BTC-e), in Japan (mtgox). Satoshi dice is in the Honduras. 
There are 6 billion people on the planet and only 320 million in the US. The global bitcoin community may have to cut the Americans off to survive, but they can and will thrive without you.

The transaction fee on litecoin is too large for it to work well for small transactions (at the moment the fee is larger in dollar terms than on bitcoin).
For low transaction fees, Devcoin is really the way to go (and it's an older safer coin than Litecoin)

It's free riding if you are benefiting but not paying. So in teh case of defence - say I pay via my insurance, but you refuse to pay but benefit from my money repelling an invasion, you are free-riding.
If you don't benefit you are not free-riding. So if I have insurance on my house, I'm the only one who benefits, and you are not free-riding if you don't bother to get insurance for your house, as the only person you are hurting is yourself if your house burns down.

SEPA is available if you buy and sell through Bitstamp.
All EU banks have a SEPA identifier. If you examine your bank statement, it should have an IBAN number and a BIC number. That's all you need for a SEPA transfer.

Cyprus is a good example of a low tax country that simply didn't have any reserves when things went wrong and then stole from people's bank accounts to pay for debts. Ireland is another previously low tax country that didn't have reserves and after their crash they had to hike up taxes sharply to pay for their problems. 
By contrast countries like Germany and the UK with a higher initial tax base, had the reserves to chug along without stealing from bank accounts and which now have lower taxes than Cyprus and Ireland (because the latter have had to hike them up so much).
Those advocating no-tax worlds - how do you deal with emergencies? Having a tax system allows the govt to collect reserves over a long period of time. Have no taxes means that in an emergency you are subject to a punitive grab. People with cash in Cyprus banks lost 90% of the money over 100,000 euros and they still can't take the remaining money out of the country. They would have been better off if they'd paid modest amount of taxes in previous years which would have been used to finance the bailout.
There are costs associated with NOT having a tax system, but people forget to factor them in when trying to work out which system is cheapest.

Don't forget Devcoin. It's older than all the alts you listed, and apart from litecoin it's the only one with something like a fledgling economy.
There's ways to earn it and ways to spend (exchange for amazon vouchers or do gambling or whatever). And the transaction fee is uber-low - works out to $0.00005, whereas the litecoin fee is about $0.13. So devcoin better for microtransactions.

I don't think it will displace the dollar - it will just become another currency people trade.
The real value of bitcoin isn't it's price against the dollar - it's the low transaction fees. 
Bitcoin will displace paypal and take a chunk of business away from VISA in the same way MP3's killed the CD and iTunes took a chunk of business from the high street music retailers.

No-one can tell which alt-coin becomes the next big thing, so many people just put a tiny amount into each (about $2 worth into each).
There's an interesting discussion about this in the cryptocurrency subreddit:

I agree with most of that - only one quibble: book printing in England happened because King Edward IV championed it. During the War of the Roses he had to hurriedly decamp to the Netherlands - while there he met William Caxton, who was an Englishman abroad eagerly learning about the new printing malarkey.
When Edward IV regained his throne, he asked Caxton to come back and commissioned his first books. That capital (from the commission), plus the proceeds of the sale of the books helped Caxton establish his book printing business.
Also - if you look back at teh rennaisance - a lot of the rediscovery of the Ancient Greek and Latin texts was sponsored by the Medici. Lorenzo de Medici spent a lot of money trying to obtain the original texts and statues, and he even set up a school to teach young Florentine sculpters how the Greeks did their sculpture - one of the lucky artists who got educated in that school was the teenage MichaelAngelo.
So powerful patrons can certainly make a difference as to whether something takes off or dies.

If you want to "hasten the process", you can always launch a 51% attack on Litecoin to kill it (that's what happened in 2011 to many new alts).
If you can't do that then just live with Litecoin (and all the other alts).
It's kind of weird that some bitcoiners claim they are creating a new world, but they are upset that this new world has the FREEDOM to allow people to choose which coin they want to support.
You cannot force people to do things and remove choice. More determined folk than you have tried - Hitler, Stalin, Mao. If people want to drink Pepsi or KMart cola instead of Coke, they will. If they want to support Litecoin or Devcoin instead of Bitcoin, they will. Live with it.

You can either use that card to buy bitcoins, or nip across the border to Brazil and withdraw the dollars.
