think of it this way: if this shit suddenly goes to zero, will i kill myself? if the answer is yes, you're in way too deep. take any gains and get out.

i got it from cnbc but then re checked not too long ago and no one knows why so i take back what i had previously said. conspiracy theories, commence!

This shit is epic

if that's the case, double down and buy more. either way, maybe rethink suicide. you may strike it super rich. why kill yourself then? you're living it super big

you can still sell and make a profit. it's at 13k

what compelled you to sell your IOTA? genuine curiosity.

it's because all the asians are panic selling their cryptos because of news that their governments might be taxing the hell out of their gains from cryptos
when wall street does their magic it will be much uglier than this

Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:36:09
Blame the asians
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:42:39
that's nice. hopefully the market is kind
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:01:54
that's good at least it worked out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:08
lol you shoulda saw it when it was at 19k and sold then
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:39:12
lmao that's crazy. if you are right, reply back to this during the summer so that i can praise your prophetic powers
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:11:47
look at the news, the asians are panic selling their crypto, that's why everything is dipping, not just bitcoin

how old is your brother in law and what if he never goes to college?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:10:39
the question is, does the person even know what bitcoin is or how it works?
