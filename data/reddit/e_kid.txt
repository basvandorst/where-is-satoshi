You smart

haha, thank you intergalactictrash. 
Erm, you stumped me with the TLDR request... ebikes are just regular push bikes with electric motors attached and powered by batteries. 
They fun.

Cheers, JimmyRUDjam.
I'll update this post in the future. This was the day that it all started, and you guys wished me luck.

Thank you hanorb, and good luck to you also! I hope it works out for you with the cryptoing. 
My situation at work over the past month or so was such that I was able to get much more into it myself. The best advice I can give is: don't believe all the hype, but also don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Invest in the coins that you truly believe in.

The long term plan is to build complete bikes. The short term plan is to convert regular bikes with my own kit.
After years of scrounging and saving, I'm finally freed from the shackles of my office job, and I can go into this full time. 
I'm buzzed.

Seems like a no brainer to me!
