If your goal and ideology was to not be a victim of identity theft, then you left after they got hacked later on in 2011....
There's no way to sugar coat this - Gox has been demonstrating their incompetence for nearly 3 years now.

I don't know why you're getting down votes here. It's not even like you were saying nobody should download it, or the developers are malicious. 
I think you're totally justified in reminding people of the risks of closed source software - especially unregulated, unverified and unaudited software you're going to let handle money. Bitcoin probably wouldn't be around today if it's beta was closed source.
*"Hey, everybody, put your coins in my software - it's totally safe. I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to make sure they're safe, but I will do in future, honest!"*
This software is probably fine, but there's no guarantee or proof and I think it's important people are reminded of that, and don't forget that upvotes don't equate to security.

Probably my girlfriend. If I was her, I'd leave me for Mike.

Gox stopped being the go to place to trade when they started asking for personal details. They didn't require any personal details in 2011.
Anyone around since then who still had money in there.... well... I don't think you need to be told again how much of much of an idiot you are.

Hopefully the API keys have been taken out of the code this time, Amir &amp;

I think my girlfriend has that t-shirt he's wearing.

That's incorrect - it depends when you registered.
I registered back in early 2011 and I've never had to send any documents, even when I withdrew my BTC about 12 months ago.

I'm guessing you've never had a false sexual assault allegation bought against you....

The point I was making was that they're incompetent. The fact that it was only e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords that were leaked wasn't because they were competent, it was because that's all they held at the time, and they couldn't even look after those.
