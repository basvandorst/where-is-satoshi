Actually, it's probably worse if you are not employed. Chances are they will consider all gains as your income and you will need to pay tax on the full amount of your gains instead of 50%

it's an old affiliate code, no idea if it will work. But let me know, because I know many are looking for one.

Or, do you mean like an Auto sell feature? Where are you from? Quadrgacx has auto sell
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:50:20
Your money isn't locked into Coinbase. Just send it to another exchange where you can cash out ? 
Quadrigacx and coinsquare allows Canadians to cash out. Or even localbitcoins if you have to. Coinbase is amazing for canadians since it allows instant purchases with credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:55:36
Well, for sure don't try to extort them. Haha. That's just asking for trouble. 
If this would happen at a bank you would be on the hook for it and probably charged with theft if you didn't return it.
That being said, this is crypto. If you really want to try to keep it, keep your mouth shut. Delete this thread and keep the amount aside for a year in case they figure out what happened. If no one says anything after a year, then you can probably get away with playing stupid and saying you didn't notice or something...
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:19:15
Don't send bitcoin from coinbase to QuadrigaCX. Instead buy LTC or ETH and send to Quadriga and convert back to BTC... or buy BTC directly from Quadriga. It's not worth buying and sending small amounts because the fees are crazy right now.
Sending BTC should be reserved for sending large amounts (ie. $5k+). 
If you already have BTC in coinbase, you can deposit in GDAX, buy LTC or ETH. Send the LTC or ETH to Quadriga and then buy BTC form Quadriga with the LTC or ETH. You will end up saving money just on the transfer fee (for smaller amounts).
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:27:40
try this from bitcoin.com site. 
You should be able to get your funds back as long as you control the private key for the BCH address.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:20:54
88 confirmations more than enough. When did you send the transaction? If you click on receive in the bitcoin app are your addresses the same? Can you see the address you sent to? And is it the Bitcoin.com app?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:22:50
very low fee. 20 sat per byte. It is basically in the lowest tier. 
Meaning, it will probably never be confirmed and will be returned to your wallet after it expires.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:38:08
Ever see the meme where the guy asks about cashing out BTC for 1mil... and the response is something like: If crypto works, you won't have to cash out, it will have replaced fiat completely.
That's the difference, some are looking to get "fiat rich" others are in it for the technology and sociological aspects of it

That's what he is saying. PayPal and crypto are not friends. You could buy crypto with PayPal and then 30days later if you lose it, complain to PayPal and they will reverse the transaction even though you already received the coins, which are irreversible. 
Until Paypal updates their policies, no company or person  in their right mind will ever sell you crypto for PayPal.

Check this link before manually setting your fees. I will give you an estimation:  
right now:
101 sat/b is estimated within the next 134 blocks
201 sat/b is within 33 blocks
between 391 sat/b for next block

Depends, if you lose the 15k will you be totally screwed and your life over? Or will you recover from the loss fairly quickly?
Basically, don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
That being said, I think there is a better chance it doubles in value than goes to $0. So... maybe invest $5k?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:08:37
Oye, people really need to start researching what they are buying before they invest. But anyways, in coinbase, click Accounts, you will see a list of your wallets. Click Send on the wallet you have your coins in. Enter the BTC address you want to send your coins to, set the amount of coins you want to send... click send. 
Wait for the coins to arrive on your new address and sell them.

Then get paid in cash and buy bitcoin with it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:57:11
Not sure what you mean. What are you having issies with with quadigacx? You pretty much just need to create a free account and get verified. Then you are ready to buy and sell just as you would with coinbase. In your dashboard in quadrigacx you should have options to fund or withdraw all of the available currencies
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:41:46
Then you invested too much. Ask the guys who went through the 2013 "bubble" and lost 85% that took 3 years to recover.
If losing 50% will put you in a bad spot you need to pull out 50% and invest in something more stable 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:31:32
Source: me. I convinced a bunch of my friends to invest in 2013 when price was rising to $1000+ only to crash back down to $200. I was enemy  and the guy who lost all my friends money for a long time. They all sold at a loss and are regretting it now. 
It's just not worth the hassle of being blamed for something you have no control over.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:30:18
never had to wait myself, but it's about 2 weeks from what people say. You could also try a fee accelerator. Unfortunately, Bitcoin is very broken right now :(
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:50:44
To which bitcoin app did you send the transaction to? BTC and BCH share the same address. As long as you didn't sent to a Segwit address you should be able to just export the private key from BTC and import it into BCH wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:50:47
but yes. I don't think Coinbase is in the business of stealing money. Was just a suggestion in case you needed funds faster.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:41:50
?? what makes you say that? Guy is saying that a hardware wallet is currently worth 20% of his total investment. I'm just trying to help him out store his private keys for as little as possible with the greatest amount of security. Obviously an encrypted USB key is not a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:53:24
There aren't a million options. QuadrigaCX is probably the best out of the bunch if you factor in fees and liquidity. 
Otherwise, you have:
and so on...
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:04:39
Just remember. It is very easy to make money in a bull market. If/When we hit a bearish phase, all that ROI will evaporate and people will start panic selling at losses and blaming BTC volatility for losing money... That's what happened in 2013 anyways. Everyone is always happy when the price goes up and freaks out when it goes down.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:24:39
21-30 sat/byte is includes withing 134 blocks. 
11-20 is no estimate
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:58:22
honestly, the best way is to just get multiple ledgers (3) and keep them in different places. The odds of all 3 malfunctioning at the same time and you ever needing your 24 words again would be pretty big.... Even if one fails, you still have 2 so you wouldn't need to worry about your 24 words unless you lose 2 devices completely, then maybe think of replacing the lost 2... or transferring your current balance out of your last ledger if you are having issues with your words.
 That being said. Still save your 24 words somewhere... just in case. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:13:35
haha. yup. pretty much :P
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:47:05
Probably not, but it will be very suspicious when IRS guy comes over and has to pass by 2x Teslas in the driveway.
But yes, it is a taxable event in most countries. You traded BTC for something that has a verifiable monetary value.... so say you traded 2 btc for a 40k tesla, is the same as selling 2 btc for 40k USD from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:55:12
get a second nano, in case you lose the first and keep it in a secondary location. Much easier than purchasing a new one, waiting for shipping and stressing out about entering the correct phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:29:28
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:11:52
from Bitcoin.com? You should be fine. I just installed it and the addresses are the same for BCH and BTC. Try it out. Click receive and you will see the same address for both wallets. Bitcoin.com wallet is actually pretty good for this.
You will get them eventually. The bitcoin network is quite congested right now so your transaction is probably just stuck waiting for a confirmation. Check the transaction on coinbase, you should have a link to it and you can check it on a block explorer or search the address you sent to on blockchain.info and you should see the status of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:49:46
that's why i suggested converting to LTC or ETH to send to other exchange. You risk waiting 30 mins for transfer at the most, so your exposure to volatility is pretty minimal... especially if doing it in small chunks.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:15:09
Why would you answer this if you have no idea what you are talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:20:00
Look up Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube and watch everything you can from him :) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:13:21
Just use a USB stick. Encrypt it with Vera Crypt and store PDF prints of your private keys on the encrypted key. Boom!... hardware wallet for $5. Make a second copy to store in a second location.
While ledgers and Trezors are nice... if you are only storing &lt; $1000 worth of crypto, they are pretty much overkill imo.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:41:38
is converting to crypto and cashing out elsewhere messier and slower than waiting for support?
I dunno, if I were you I would probably open accounts with a few other exchanges and start the verification process in the meantime. 
If you get verified on the other exchanges before you get an answer from coinbase, then I would convert to LTC or ETH on GDAX and cash out small chunks on the other exchanges (depending on daily/weekly limits) while I wait on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:54:42
Coinbase is pretty straight forward :) Problem is you can't sell crypto on coinbase if you are Canadian. Buy only. If you want to cash out, you will need to find alternate methods
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:42:33
Increased limits and/or multiple exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:11:41
All of them? I'm not sure I understand your question. I've never encountered any exchange that does not allow you to trade once you deposit. If they have a BTC/USD pair you should be able to convert no problem
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:45:19
Not sure then. Seems like your phone isn't syncing properly. Reboot your phone and try again? Or try downloading the pc/mac versions and recovering from your backup seed there. It might be easier to see what is going on and what addresses you have listed. As long as you keep your recovery seed safe, the odds are pretty high you will end up recovering the coins somehow.  Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:29:52
Don't convince anyone to invest anything. If they lose money they will blame you for bad advice.
Just educate them and provide with the resources so they can convince themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:16:14
Yes. Exactly. You can use the same seed on as many nanos as you like :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:29
No. Not exactly the same. But for &lt;$1000 it is probably worth the extremely small risk of exposing your key temporarily. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:05
I doubt it. In legal terms value will be determined as USD value at the time of the loss. Same as Mt. Gox
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:48:44
You can buy and sell with QuadrigaCX in Canada. You can also buy from coinbase, send to QuadrigaCX and sell from there if you choose.

I dunno, going all in at this price point seems crazy to me. What happened to only invest what you are willing to lose. 
I actually think crypto will "crash" quite a bit. Simply because people are just trying to get rich at this point... and as soon as it stops going up, up, up... there will be a lot of panic since no one is in it for the cryptoanarchism anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:05:56
you sent your BTC to Bitsamp wallets. Once they have credited your deposit, they can do what they want with it or transfer it to other internal wallets/cold storage. 
trading and selling isn't done with your specific coin. it's just a virutal ledger on the site backed by your deposit. When/if you withdraw you will get different coins.
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:55:40
Not really going to help OP, but for everyone else. Losing your 2FA is a huge pain in the butt.
1) Be very careful when upgrading/changing your 2fa devices. Always make sure your 2FA has been imported and actually work to login on your new device BEFORE you wipe/sell/give away your old one.
2) whenever you are promoted to scan a barcode to activate 2FA. Take a screenshot and save them to an encrypted file somewhere. This way, if the unimaginable happens. You just need to rescan the barcode from another device and you are back in
3) get yourself a cheap phone/iPod touch and get all your 2FA set up on it identically to your main device. If you lose your phone, you've got a back up.
4) Don't delete emails with recovery information. Export them and save them in an encrypted file somewhere.
Best of luck OP. Hope you manage to find your info somewhere. As much as it sucks, BitGo is doing us all a solid here. It's not supposed to be easy to reset 2FA. Not something you can just send an email to support for and answer a couple of security questions. This is for the greater good
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:01:31
nah. people developed GUI's and solutions so that people could visualize their emails rather than construct command lines they didn't understand.
People didn't get used to the first incarnations of the internet/email.
Try sending an email with unix mail today and see how long i takes? Try browsing with Gopher? Try having your grandmother connect to the internet with a dial up modem on a pulse analog line and Trumpet Winsock out of the box?
The protocol (TCP/IP) is still the same... it's the tools around it that made it more accessible to the average user. 
We are still a long way away from that... which is why were are still on the ground floor. But we are still many years away from the majority of people using crypto on a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:48:19
As far as I know they've already credited your BCH if you held bitcoin before August 1st.  so you shouldn't have to do anything.
Otherwise, you would need to get your private key from them and then import it into a bch wallet/service.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:05:14
haha. And I agree with everything you said also :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:43:32
I think you are missing the point. Storing your private keys yourself is complicated as all hell for every joe, harry and sally out there. Do you think your grandmother/aunt/uncle/neighbors are all going to think of dummy wallets, plan a's, b's and c's?
Most people can't even remember where they put their car keys on any given day. Much less remember 24 word seeds and alternates in case of thefts.
It's a very real problem and it is the biggest hurdle preventing mass adoption. For now. I guarantee you 99% of new users are probably storing their crypto in Coinbase/etc...
Only users with very large holdings or those who have been burned before by exchanges are holding private keys locally.
Of course, there are exceptions, but the entry barrier to security needs to get a lot more user friendly before any type of mass adoption can happen.
I say this as someone who is very bullish overall in crypto. I'm just a realist.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:43:48

yes, but the problem still remains. No one owns the trademark "bitcoin". So who's gonna sue who for what? This was the entire point of bitcoin to begin with. That one one governs it... hence, this is by design.

I don't think you read the OP properly.

@_date: 2017-11-24 01:47:12
You will have 0.9 btc in your wallet. Your transactions are stored on the public blockchain. Not in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:07:59
It is a real concern. You don't walk around with your entire bank account in your pockets. if you get robbed, you lose what you have on hand and that's it. No crook is going to march you to the bank and get exposed on CCTV for you to access your accounts and empty them.. and even then you have daily withdrawal limits. etc.. If someone forces you to turn over your private keys, you are screwed

If you live in the USA maybe since you can buy a gun a your local post office. But for the rest of us, that isn't reality.
multiple wallets, different storage, security, it is too much to worry about for the average joe. People will make mistakes, forget passwords, locations, etc... that's the whole reason we have banks and vaults and insurance in the first place. To protect against human error. There is a lot to think about if you have large sums tied up in crypto. As much as the entire purpose of banks is what crypto tries to solve. This thread brings up some very real problems that have yet to be solved.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:41:28
if everything goes well, you will never need to "cash out". That being said, depending on your financial situation, you may want to cash out certain portions of your holding at certain thresholds to accomplish certain goals (ie. pay off loans entirely/pay off mortgage/etc..). but never cash out more than half at once.
