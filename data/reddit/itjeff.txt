Good point. I saw that documentary it was great. Thought about the huge increase in third world mobile too
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:01:52
I still can't find an English printed version I can buy with coin 
@_date: 2015-06-19 02:45:59
Thanks for the speech @_date: 2015-06-30 23:59:29
Nice but honestly I expected much more
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:29:08
Agreed!  Pick one person. After tell everyone to scan a paper wallet private key at their seat 
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:09:10
Exact reason they need bitcoin micropayments!

Thank you nice promotion. I'm not sure about everyone posting screen shots of their personal details on a reddit thread...maybe sending to an email address would be better. I love ShapeShift what a great service. Its fast, easy, and cheap got to love it!

This goes to show why the legacy banking system is flawed. Takes forever to move money  
@_date: 2015-05-13 23:59:33
I would use bitpay. No cost to you only savings really. It can't hurt will only bring in more customers over time. Offer a slight discount.  Market to current customers new discounted payment option

Did you insert this moon code?.?  Rockets away!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:24:44
Dont carry it with you.  You could but its not really useful for spending.  Use mytrezor lite from the playstore hopefully you have android. It allows deposits and balance checks on the go easily
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:36:23
Lol nice one 100 bits @_date: 2015-01-20 03:56:11

@_date: 2016-03-29 17:31:18
wrote this about a year ago. This bug only appears on a small number of iOS devices, and the developer can't even reproduce it on his own phone. It seems to have to do with the way iOS or Apple stores TouchID protected items. If you have this problem, please e-mail ios so he can debug this issue, because it works perfectly on our devices, and our dev needs a broken version to see what actually went wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:49:10

@_date: 2015-04-11 12:17:28
really should place bitcoin in the front fast checkout options. I actually bought a fan last night from them.  Mobile site didn't display it.  Had to go to full site then on payment screen bitcoin option appeared

@_date: 2016-10-29 02:33:36
Very good point you should be very careful. You have a country with a new bold ideas and people to protect.  Maybe think about issuing your own crypto.  Recruit those local miners and many others. Open to all to ensure your network is by the people for the people and decentralized.  Use Bitcoin as your reserve currency. This could be a great model that gives you issue control and is backed at least in part. Well wishes. Cheers

Great but I'm a little concerned about Zebpay. I have 0.005 in a wallet and unable to transfer out.  I've had several emails with them for over a month back and forth and they still haven't resolved. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:48:24
Thanks. Pruning mode activated
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:01:34

@_date: 2015-03-26 04:54:33

Always use the return address even if it does show as optional.  Also never use web wallets they may delay transferring your funds right away. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:10:33
Buy a few coins soon and hold. You will not need to worry about working :)
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:04:21

Excellent analogy thanks.  I'm off to go plant some seeds
@_date: 2016-05-07 03:55:17
Why won't the government embrace bitcoin?
They hate the idea of "Proof of work"
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:21:05
Great idea!

“You put an open, decentralized ecosystem: open source, open standards, open networking and the intelligence and innovation pushed all the way to the edge — put that against a closed system, controlled by a central provider, whose permission you need in order to innovate and who will only innovate at the exclusion and competition of all of the other companies — and we will crush them.” ~ Andreas Antonopoulos
