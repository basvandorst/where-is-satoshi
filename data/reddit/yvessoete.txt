hey just wanted to say that was a great reply, i'm going to use this saying in life if you don't mind
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:19:08
Thanks, I have read all the white papers 
none of them contain answers
but thanks anyway, good luck with the HODL
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:16:05
on Reddit? $500
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:37:48
no it's not compared to BTC
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:25:06
yeah but you're part of the 0,000001%ers that mine :-)
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:57:27
"It's always like this in Januari !!"
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:46:32


no this is even crazier
because.. that .com domain name turned out to have value :-)
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:47:38
"It's normal it's the Futures market who are expiring!"
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:40:59
hey don't stop, tell me the use of bitcoin
it's just a hash with no value
you can't make payments in a shop with it because it's too slow
if you forget a passphrase you're fucked and your siblings to inherit too, worse all thieves have to do is torture you a bit for your phrase and they steal the money without a trace! wtf is that bullshit who invents shit like that
no government in the world is going to let cryptocurrency do it's thing without having them the ability to control value and taxation of money, anyone who believes that should go to a doc right now
if we need it in the blockchain on how we do things in this world the fed and central banks will make their coin linked on the currency, end of story
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:18:25
Because this is not a regulated market, they can do whatever they think they want to do. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:32:34


until it doesn't
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:34:34
yeah i'm probably not intelligent enough
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:29:02
Nothing really, since technically BTC is a huge flop to replace a dollar.  It failed completely on that part. 
What about inheritance? What if  you forget your keyword? What if you die before you share your keyword/password? What if they hold you hostage to get your key? They can just transfer the money anonymously and boom it's gone, perfect crime...
BTC just failed technically completely on all parts to be a replacement for currency.
What's left then? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:34:27
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:56:14
No, I'm not into RIPL so I'm not a banker. 
I've read the whitepaper and there are no answers for the questions I stated. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:23:25
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:46:00
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:12:08
Thank you for your answer. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:27:11
I hope so, but I think it's a bit wrong to compare BTC to real estate, real estate is not as volatile, there is really no way to compare them.
If you want a long term investment imho the stock market index is a much better value.  
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:44:54
because for them, this isn't a dip, this is a welcome surprise from their $200 entry level
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:50:15
i mined in the old days on my laptop over 10.000 bitcoins in like 2 hours
then i said fuck this my laptop is getting hot with this shit and then reformatted to install a new distro probably a few months later and didn't even bother to back them coins up
i guess like you said many millions of bitcoins are lost forever
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:47:31
that is correct
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:46:17
because that 100 billion isn't trading 
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:43:14
I would even say below $1 for a few big whales
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:09:06
because big guys who owns literally hundreds of millions or even billions of bitcoin value sell on good news, not on bad news.
they sell on good news because otherwise the price to offload their position would even be much much lower
so that's why also on wallstreet you see companies with good earnings just drop 5% or more in price
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:26:11
or to keep the 300 to 400 bitcoins i mined by experiment on my laptop at around 2007/8
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:02:38
good luck hope it works
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:40:31
lol if italy leaves euro will jump up 30%
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:22:14
you know she died poor and was on welfare for the last part of her life, right? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:36:47
this. they even manipulate IN regulated markets, can you imagine what they do in unregulated ones? 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:06:57
well in the markets things work as they did before until they don't
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:41:49
this is actually good advise 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:50:13
ok, that's all correct but i still really try to think why you think family offices and whales are loading up on btc OTC
that they allocate capital to it, I agree completely, did they do that 3 years ago? Absolutely not. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 04:11:50
OTC is between parties and isn't public, i have seen OTC trades on stocks that expire after 30 and 40 years
why do you feel that they are loading up? 
not by looking at the price i hope because that would mean you have your monitor upside down
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:46:52
let me guess, you're in for the technology, right? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:16:22
at least that fucker worked for his money and he didn't die poor or on welfare like ayn Rand 
BUT still a great book :-)
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:24:02
some start years before
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:01:09
why? when they roll over they do it directly they don't wait for expiry. Please explain. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:47:56
Only losers average losers 
@_date: 2018-05-16 19:29:16
these guys aren't idiots and they would want to have real bitcoins to their capital, if they do this OTC as you say, where would they buy these hashes from? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:12:36
eugh no
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:26:14
people don't care about it  anymore, the big hype is over
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:16:15
it just did
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:11:06
What a strong support 6k was, it took at least 25 seconds to break it /s
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:42:05
30k+ a day on gdax
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:22:56
the big guys dumping their positions
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:19:25
then we should all sell now and get in lower
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:57:34
Why would that happen? That doesn't make any sense at all. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:28:57
Sorry for your loss, I hope big karma comes your way in life so you can make up for this 10 times. Take care man. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:10:05
oh that's what the scots do with the money they get from the English taxpayers
got it
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:12:06
increase it a bit, if you want to be sure you will have to use market orders
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:30:03
I agree except for 1 thing. 
You don't need Bitcoin to have Blockchain technology, and that is what is going to happen imho, the FED will make a dollarcoin so blockchain can be implemented and Bitcoin will have a value of $0,00003... overnight.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:37:41
or a bot creating fake volume
yes, it's not illegal, because, unregulated markets
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:03:39
no you cannot (anymore), this is what you need to mine bitcoins
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:18:05
or people covering their shorts
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:03:42
with the current price drop in BTC that might be correct :-)
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:32:53
the FED can make a dollarcoin that can be used in blockchain and bitcoin will be trading at $0.00003
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:23:06
you can't mine bitcoin with gpus
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:23:57
You can't with GPUs anymore since a very longtime, you need an S9 miner
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:11:39
Yeah just like the Democrats said 1 year ago that Trump wasn't taped during election time. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:29:43
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:01:51
i'm rather in losing position with 1 bitcoin instead of 2
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:31:46
All of them. 
It's how regulated markets work, you have to use a broker. You can't just be all members of the exchange and be a specialist. What are you asking me exactly please? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:35:22
experience has learned me that when this moment happens, you won't do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:59:23
what is it with bitcoin investors that they don't accept a bear market when they see one? This is a bear market, there is nothing to buy here. Nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:56:21
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:56:44
yeah they first had to kill the 1.0 version
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:16:49


I just quoted you from above here
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:08:11
so if they are sane they hold to potentially have a 99% loss of capital instead of a 60% loss? 
I don't understand you hodl guys
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:27:06
could be also to cover a short position, so that's not a buyer, these are 2 sellers
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:44:23
the volume on the futures is such a disappointment it's no use to manipulate it, basically nobody is trading it and market making in it is very very low, it's like a failed experiment and the CBOE and CME said they are cutting back on their other plans with cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:39:38
right, so billions of people on this planet without a bankaccount started reading the whitepapers and found a way to fund accounts with what, snowflakes, so they can pay their whatevers with bitcoins
okay this shit has come to far, ffs
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:05:47
One of the hardest things in trading is admitting your position you have put up is wrong and you should cut your losses short. 
It's against human nature I guess.
That's why bear markets are usually brutal, short and fast.  
Because in many cases, your broker will cut you loose when your denial brought you to zero balance. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:39:58
how do dollars work in blockchain technology? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:33:42
this isn't AAPL we are talking about with numerous patents, buildings, tech, cash on the bank the size of most countries debts with a dividend and cash streaming in every fucking day, no
this is a hash with a promise, that could not deliver yet technically, i hope ppl are to start realising that
yes i have read the whitepapers
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:17:27
shorts covering for the weekend next week will be bloodbath again
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:36:09
If that would be the case, other whales would jump in to take profit from that there is basically arbitrage between all markets in a blip of a microsecond.
it's funny to hear people talk about 'whales' as they all work together, they live of each other beating them on mistakes, opportunities, speed, ... on everything. 
The HFT market has dropped in income 7 times over the last decade and there are not 7 times less players, so it's getting harder and harder for them to make money, the BTC futures market is flattened out like any other futures market on the planet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:56:08
the boss of the FED said they were looking into it, how is that highly unlikely, guys like him don't say things like that without a reason in the press
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:31:48
of course not, only fools would average losing trades
get out, this is a crazy bear market, don't catch a falling knife 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:01:26


That ship sailed a long time ago, you cannot mine bitcoin with GPUs anymore, you can only mine it with Antminer S9
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:32:20
or your loss double, triple or whatever...
you do realise it doesn't work if it's not going up again, do you? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:00:47
Ha it's okay, now if you want to speak to your broker it's rather very painfull and takes a while after the waiting music is over ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:39:25
idk about you but there are more large sellers than buyers
oh well, dream on i would say
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:39:19
duh, how are they gonna pay for that? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:19:31
you forget to explain what happens if BTC goes below $1 and never recovers because major countries bans BTC forgood and they make an official dollarcoin that can be used in blockchain all over the planet
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:35:14
i think that's actually more expensive
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:01:04
so according to you people in venezuela don't have bank accounts
what are you even saying
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:23:45
he can just make a deal with gdax, deposit $100mil and pay gdax to give back the borrowed btc 
what happens is usually he's on the sell side so price can't go up no matter how much buyers are coming in
he can show he is light on the offer but if you look at the time and sales you see he has more at hand than he's showing
wales move markets their only game is to hide as much as possible so others can't piggyback 
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:04:48
who said they are buying? SOROS made his money by literally shorting and breaking currencies bringing down governments etc
when soros says he's getting into bitcoin, I'm just reading that he sees another way to destroy something for his gain
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:44:01
how crazy is that
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:36:15
he keeps selling so prices goes even down further
keeps selling
then he says okay i'm good (can be very long time) and he just buys back lower (or over a long period so it doesn't climb up)
it's killing everything you can't fight guys like soros
they are
killer wales
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:05:43
the low of the 2008 S&amp;P500 crash, the low of the bear market a decade ago
kid you not
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:08:22
was it 666 area?
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:07:02
who says they are buying? they could be shorting like crazy to destroy it 
they have too much money into real $ they could just get in to destroy it
