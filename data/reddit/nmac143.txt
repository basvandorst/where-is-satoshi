Honestly, after some calculations, I think it is just that they take a very large percent of the profit. So bitcoin would be able to aid in decreasing the price, but it would also be largely be from me just taking a smaller cut. Additionally, I have been concerned as well about attracting non bitcoin customers; as someone mentioned above, the site could sell tokens (maybe even an altcoin) that could be bought one time to buy and sell photos.

Thanks, that is why I posted this to get some critical feedback. Currently, until I gain some traction, this would be more of bitcoin project than a company aimed at taking down an big names :) Storage costs have also been a big concern of mine, currently Amazon sell storage at 0.02-3 per gb per month so storage wise at least while beginning that should not be a big a deal. All in all those were some very rough estimates that will need to be adjusted with time as there are many variables that I don't know that could increase the cut I will need to take.

Haha I guess I should have looked around a little more, before starting, thanks for sharing that :)

That's great, I have yet to get very far into building it, but I believe I could have out an alpha version by mid-august. Can't wait to see how this works out. If you have any questions or recommendations feel free to pm me or post to this chain.
And sorry I don't live in London :(

I am fairly new to web development. I would love to work on a project with someone with industry experience. Although, after thinking about it more, the issue I think we would have is accusation, of customers. Maybe we could make it open source and do it just as a bitcoin proof of concept (we could go so far as hosting the photos on sia's distributed network)? Please contact me back, with your thoughts if you are still interested :)

One thing that I have been contemplating to make this service stand out is using the blockchain to, store keys that uniquely identify a purchase of each image, and then using those keys to in some way modify the images to a point where the human eye can not see the difference but a computer can link the image to the key (think of it as an invisible qr code). This could then be used to curb unlicensed replications of the images, and help point point image producers to those who illegally use their image. My only question with this is whether piracy is an issue with stock images, and if so would this be enough to encourage someone like yourself to use a service with this feature.

What do you think about making it open source? Do you think this would help or hurt the project?
