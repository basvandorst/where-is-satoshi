Wow. Thanks for posting this. I'm in tears reading it. What an inspiration!
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:45:57
That's awesome. Congrats on buying your freedom!

Been in the cryptocurrency community since freshman, an a Redditor for only 3 months? Something not adding up here...
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:58:44
I second this.

Wow. Good stuff.  Got excited when he started talking about massive volume unlike anything we've ever seen
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:51:16
IDK, the mainstream news outlets are agenda driven. I don't even think it's about ratings/clicks anymore, but more about pushing a certain agenda that was devised in some think tank somewhere.  is real
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:47
Awesome video! I'm gonna like subscribe to your channel now
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:09:59

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:44:47
Yes thank you. Competition and diversity is good for ecosystems
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:47:08
Of course. All the banks I see at every corner, like I used to see blockbuster locations. Can't wait to see the same thing happen to gas stations
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:48:47
I like how you think. I wish more thought this way!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:02

I lost 2.37. Luckily I got about 7 of them out of Gox a few months ago. Thank Goodness. I guess I don't feel too bad since I originally paid about $150 for them but till sucks pretty bad though. It really drives home the point of not investing more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:22:12
Welcome to the club. I lost much BTC trying to day trade when I first started. Panic selling, panic buying, and even panic holding. Takes much fortitude go go against emotional trading.

No dudes talking about Bitcoin in this video. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:02:10
Nice piece, but did not like the way it ended.  They called my business to ask some questions so I was hoping to see this. Thanks for posting! 
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:33:10

Thank you!

Not really a talk but more of talking heads and chatter from news programs and sound bites from talks  
@_date: 2016-06-02 02:57:47
May incorporate this idea when I edit parts 1,2 &amp; (eventually) 3 together.Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:55:43

HODL is for non-trading newbs who are prone  to FOMO and panic selling the bottom. Nothing wrong with that. More seasoned investors will be less emotional with their stack and trade accordingly
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:35:01
Thanks. I think I heard Antonopoulos say somewhere that Bitcoin is not going anywhere and the genie is out of the bottle. I feel like he might be right!

@_date: 2015-08-12 14:29:33
It just happened to me. Got letter on Monday about my BOA business checking account. They are closing it without saying why the reason is. My guess is because i used Coinbase and circle like a savings account. I thought maybe because i started paying landlord/neighbor rent with cash, just to save money to have to buy checks and now they think I must be a criminal. Bummer because now I have to find new bank.

@_date: 2017-09-18 15:23:26
They did the same to me a couple years ago
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:31:06
Cool design. Maybe there is something you could do with "this is gentlemen"
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:20:53
If you don't have any Bitcoin right then hell yeah, you better get a move on it.

Check out  to pay for digital media production services with Bitcoin... We price things on per project basis. Although we don't say so specifically on our website currently,  we would be happy to offer discounts of 15% off.   Video production,  website design,  digital signage,  Graphic design.

The cover looks great! 
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:42:50
There isn't a lot going on here for places to spend bitcoin... Even though we have a bunch of hipster-like establishments,  apparently they are not hip enough to take BTC,  and if I even ask, all I get is puzzled looks.  However I can say that I did buy a filling today for 0.67 BTC from a dentist.  They said it had been 6 months since they had a another customer paid with BTC.  FL more progressive than you average southern state, but have to realize this is still the deep South.

Hey, I actually am the author of this video series! Have you seen Episode 2? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:59:20
Sounds about right. However maybe a little mini bubble first that will take us to $2600 ish and crash back to the 700's
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:14:42
Don't give it to them yet. As non believers they are likely to sell early
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:08:18
New media coverage just starting to trickle in. Should have enough footage to work with in another couple weeks or so for Episode 3
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:34:50
They don't take it anymore. They used to when Tony Gallippi would hold Bitcoin Meet ups there. When I called them a year ago the person that answered said no.  There is a Columbian Cafe in Lake Mary.. Not that close to Disney though.  I've been looking and there really not any places to buy food in Orlando with Bitcoin unfortunately other than that Cafe
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:01:58
Cool, but I couldn't get it to work
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:25:25

I don't believe so. Maybe. I don't really know how it works that good either. Hmmm. Looking into it now.
Edit: Nope, didn't get it :(
@_date: 2016-07-10 13:27:34
Well done! Sounds like you are living the dream. I want to come work for you and be an apprentice and live off the electrical grid. Eventually would like to be able to get an acre, and green house of my own. I'm ready to invest my time, money, energy into something this. Would just need an internet connection to continue my freelance web design business. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:11:39
I like it. but would be better if there was no vocals.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:07:31
Thanks for doing this! I was about to start sifting through the hearings for highlights for my news highlight video and this will help me find things faster. 
Edit: I mean thanks for sharing this post!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:34:59
Haha, yeah somehow I missed the cyprus soundbite.... I plan to add that snippet later when I revisit this. Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:49:13
This is probably not going to help 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:49:47
Hmm too bad. If you find a link, send it my way.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:51:32

@_date: 2013-11-25 20:18:05
Agreed. I plan to cut it down so there will be a shorter version too.

Yea, i would guess they are not laughing anymore. Thanks!

@_date: 2013-12-12 06:21:49
Cool video.  Did you make it?

Thanks for sharing it! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:16:51
Nice work! Do you think you will ever animate? Might be cool to have a 360 degree loop of it spinning ion the y axis.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:39:10
It's a work in progress. Thought it would be fun to try and tell the story of Bitcoin through mainstream news soundbites. I plan to add more recent news segments and the Senate hearings. Let me know what you think!
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:46:42
why reinvent the wheel? eh? Actually I agree but I was in a hurry to post it. Have any suggestion for music that is not as played out? I will be happy to consider it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:17:21
ok great. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:19:35
Nice! thanks for sharing. This production company is also accepting bitcoin,  Might even be the first one in Orlando.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:52:35
There is a lot of good material from the senate hearing to pick from. Great suggestions. Thanks! I cant wait to add the "It's complicated" guy.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:01:40
I've been editing this video over the past couple days. I know it's a little long and it's missing more recent CNBC interviews and the Senate hearings, but let me know what you all think.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:44:51
Send me the link. And maybe suggest to me a time segment that would work well as a soundbite.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:34:23
Yes, you are correct. This is motion graphics.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:10:29
I can vouch for 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:06:13
Cool.  Nice work!

@_date: 2013-11-30 03:53:53
Yes. Solar panels too.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:42:50
Oh man, that would be great. I'll keep an eye out for that clip, but if you think of who said it, let me know!
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:30:19
Wow. My first Bitcointip, Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:09:24
I will add to this one and do some further refining of the edits, and then yes i will repost a new one.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:39:45
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:25:29
Do you know at what point in the interviews he says these quotes?  
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:49:37
I thought about that too. It's easy to re-edit the footage to give it a different spin. It's a work in progress. I'm planning on a 2-3 minute version eventually after adding more recent positive news its been getting lately and clips the the senate hearing. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:57:55

Thanks for the suggestions. I had the Requiem song in my head when I first was thinking about making this video but i did not know the name of the song., even though I know it's a little played out..but still good. has an epic feel.  So thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:59:44
That's funny! 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:39:34

Nice.  Good job!  What editing software do you use.  I'm stuck on  Sony Vegas,  but need to get more into Premiere.. I'm on PC
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:00:30
Hey great points! I was actually thinking starting with a longer version first, and then cutting down to a another shorter version.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:50:01
Thanks man! Glad you like the music. Yes, i'm planning to do another pass at it later. I'm taking a break now. I probably spent 20 hours on it between Friday and Saturday! it was a labor of love, but I'm excited to do some refining, and add some more clips when I get more time.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:30:31
That's a good point. i made this one more for the Bitcoin community. I really need to get the new CNBC video. I can't seem to get the video files from their website. I'm working on it though.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:57:47
Thanks, I know some particular clips need some audio adjustment. I will fixing those and maybe bring down the music some more.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:19:53
Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:33:22
Thanks! Yes, Planning on doing that next as well as adding additional news clips from more recent CNBC segments
