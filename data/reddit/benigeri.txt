Try adding 'display: inline-block' to the li elements, and removing their float property. Then add 'text-align: center' to the ul.

Here is the wallet that I am using to do the payouts: 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:33:16
I'm really just trying to better understand they way all of us use and want to use BTC. I will only be using the emails/forum usernames to contact people who submitted responses that I am really curious about. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:22:29
That does not require users to disclose any personal information though
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:54:32
Ok, I switched wallet, here is the new block chain url: 
I paid out the 15 earliest responses. I still have a bunch more to do, but I need to convert some alt coins and move the BTC to my block chain wallet. Since it's 4am, I'll do everything tomorrow.
Thanks to everyone who filled in the survey, your answers have generally been very insightful!

I'd like to thank everyone who participated in the survey, we've collected a phenomenal amount of data. More than 850 people submitted responses, and the majority of the answers are very detailed  and thoughtful. 
When I created this survey, I was hoping to get 10-20 responses, maximum 50 if I was really lucky and it hit the front page. As stated, I spent 0.15BTC paying out the first participants between 0.001-0.01BTC, but that only covered 40 or so of you guys. 
I really do appreciate everyone's responses, so I've decided to donate 0.0001BTC to each and everyone of you. I know it's a tiny amount, but hopefully it means a little bit to a lot of people!
Transaction: 
If you were really counting on a larger payout, and you really need the money, I'm happy to make some exceptions. If that's the case just send me an email at me and I'll be more than happy to send you a little more. 
Thanks again for participating, and I'll try to post the results as soon as possible. Going through &gt; 40,000 words of survey responses is probably going to take a while. 
Thanks !!!

So I just payed out a bunch more people: 
I'd like to send at least 0.0001BTC to all the participants, since I can't afford more. That said, I need to send a small sum to 800 different addresses, what is the best way to mass-send BTC?
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:48:32
I have no idea how it would work. I talked to someone about it and it seems like a good idea, so we were curious about the feasibility and pro/cons. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:56:50
75,000 includes online merchants
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:46:03
lol yup, notice that I never got anything back....
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:03:41
Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:44:05
What field other than BTC Net Worth and email address should have been optional? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:45:48
Thanks for the correction. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:23:54
Thanks, I'll anonymize and aggregate the results at some point. I'll send you a message when it's done. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:26:38
Also wondering the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:17:37
My multi bit wallet is currently all "unspendable" so I'm waiting for a confirmation to be able to send more. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:27:30
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:45:38
Yup, I'll post aggregated/anonymized data as soon as I can. 
And thanks for letting me know, I'll nuke my server and start it up again :)
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:43:24
There was absolutely no obligation to give up privacy. The net worth could be approximated, the email/contact field was optional, and so was the address. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:52:22
Looks like I can do it easily through electrum :)
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:31:11
Thanks to everyone that submitted responses! This is ridiculous, I've gotten over 800 responses.... Even though I really appreciate everyone's work in filling out the survey, I don't have 0.8-8BTC to give out to everyone. 
I have already payed out approximately 0.09 BTC, and I will payout the rest to the people that filled in the form as early as possible. In order to make the situation a tiny bit better, I will try to send a small amount to everyone who participated in the survey. 
In addition, if you desperately need the money, or if you are really unhappy with the situation, send me and email and we can try to work something out. 
Please don't let this prevent you from filling in the survey though, the data will help people better understand all of your behavior, and will hopefully result in better services for the Bitcoin community!

This doesn't apply here because a safari extension could have done the same. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:54:12
just payed out everyone: 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:45:57
I'm sure I'll enjoy reading it!
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:59:46
Right, but a good exchange wouldn't insure a poorly run one. 
Ideally top exchanges would become really transparent with each other, and it would be obvious when an exchange starts being unprofessional. At that point, the subset of good exchanges would realize it's a bad idea to continue insuring the bad exchange and stop doing so. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:27:21
How do you protect yourself from being overcharged? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:38:45
hah my mining income &gt; my allowance, so I spend BTC on a lot of nice sushi dinners. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:42:41
Hey, thanks for pointing out your concern.
I do think that including that filed was important in the research. People that own less than 1 BTC might have a completely different behavior than those who got in early and own &gt; 100 BTC. 
If you are uncomfortable putting in your 'net worth' but still want to participate, you could just approximate it. And if that isn't good enough, then you could also fill in the survey with a new wallet, or without putting your wallet /email. 
If it's really lage
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:23:42
What is you address? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:24:09
Can you please share the url they sent you to?
