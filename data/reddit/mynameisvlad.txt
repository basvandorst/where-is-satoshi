As has already been said, making sure the source is good is a completely separate issue.

That's not 100% true though. Free bank transfers generally apply *within* the country you're in, whereas the main customer at WU is going to be someone sending money to their family overseas/in another country (otherwise, they'd just use their bank as we already established it's free). 
The alternative to WU on the bank's end is a complicated wire transfer, where you need lots of information on the receiving end, including sensitive bank information, and which usually costs to both send and receive (my credit union charges **$40** for an outgoing wire transfer).
In that case, the steps to convert back and forth from BTC may be less costly and easier.

Wut? There is no database "designed for online transaction processing". Hell, I don't even know what that would look like. There's nothing special about that domain space to require a special database. NoSQL is as good as any in that regards.


This is one of the stupidest things I've read. Too hip to write financial software? You don't have to be a boring suit to write financial software, and you don't have to be "hip" to write Facebook or Twitter. How do you know what the team is *actually* like based on the look of their site?

So how exactly would Bitcoin help someone in that situation since:
1. The by far easiest way to obtain bitcoin is to trade it for traditional currency.
2. The by far easiest way to trade traditional money for bitcoin is to transfer from a bank.
Average Joe isn't about to use his home computer to mine Bitcoins at a huge loss and atrocious return rate.

You being in the right in this particular instance and you overreacting and being a douche are not mutually exclusive.

“Inevitably fail”. Hahahaha. You’re a funny one. Please show me proof that all 180 currencies will eventually fail. 
You do realize the pound sterling is more than 1200 years old, right? It’s survived the majority of human history. It’s going to outlast a highly unstable 10-year old currency. With ease. It’s done it many, many times before. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:15:21
I had to look it up too, I couldn’t believe it when I first read it. USB 2 is almost 19 years old at this point too, which is just as insane considering it’s so widely used still. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:11:09
I mean, that’s still a bailout. I would consider that even worse since it needed to fix a bug in the coin itself. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:24:07
Your definition of a failed currency is not the world’s definition of a failed currency. 
You also cant, with a straight face and complete honesty, say that 1% of inflation is bad but look at one of the most unstable currencies in the short term and think thats a viable replacement. The leaps in logic for that to happen are crazy high. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:01:46
Sure looked successful for the pst 1200 years. But yknow, don’t go by most of the world’s accounts, your naive opinion is the only one that truly matters.

Being more descriptive than "vegas security guy" might help people figure out what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:55:14
However, it technically is currency, and if it's in excess of 10,000 dollars, it needs to be declared for import or export.

Maybe because, oh I don't know, it actually is a standard customs inspection? Shocker.
It followed a pretty normal path going from a small town in MD, to a regional post office (Baltimore), to an international postal center (JFK), to Canada.
It went to Jamaica, NY because that's where JFK is, which is the east coast international shipping center, just like a package coming from a western state would most likely route through LAX (the LA ISC). I know because I'm Canadian, I've ordered dozens of things from the US and abroad which enter either through Jamaica or LA. It provides a centralized place where all mail can funnel through, thus needing customs people at only one mail center instead of hundreds of semi-large international airports.
There is absolutely no proof that the device was tampered or that it was the NSA. Anyone who says otherwise is at this point paranoid and should probably take off the tin foil hat.
Edit: And as [said]( it started out in MD because that's where the US distribution happens.
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:00:03


Why? For all we know, it *isn't* tampered, and therefore still producing randomness. And even if, let's say it was tampered, and producing non-random values, then it's *still* better than just a salt alone since people that don't have access to these non-random values would not be able to get at it. And for the people that *do* have access to these values, the salt will keep them out.
So it makes absolutely *no* sense to throw it out other than for paranoid purposes. At worst, you have a salt + non-random values nobody else other than the person who compromised it would know, at best, you have a salt + random values. Either way, it's better than a salt alone.

Nothing you said is really accurate. 18 years from now you’ll still be able to buy an old as fuck computer for next to nothing that would be able to run both the software and have the ports necessary to. Vintage computer restoration is a big thing now and there’s nothing indicating that it’ll stop. 
Additionally, one of the biggest aspects of USB so far has been backwards compatibility, and nothing indicates that this will stop either. You can plug in a USB 1.0 device (about 23 years old now) into a 3.1 port with a C-to-A adapter and it’ll work just the same. 
In terms of the software front, it’s pretty trivial to run Windows 1.0 on a VM. If you can run the first version of Windows, released 31 years ago, now, then it’s almost 100% likely that you’d be able to run Windows 10 18 years from now. 
Hell, millions of people still run Windows XP on their computers, and that is turning exactly 18 years old next year. 
Backwards compatibility is a real thing in computing. 
Even on the flash decay front, most people estimate flash drives will last over 50 years if left untouched. The biggest source of flash death is from limited write cycles, not from length of time.

That’s not the point the comment is making. The point is Bitcoin is volatile and not the best choice to be used in certain situations like transferring money, as you’re losing money on transaction and currency exchange fees, and could lose a decent chunk of it by the time the entire source currency-&gt;BTC-&gt;transfer-&gt;desired currency set of transactions completes. 
A long-term stable currency is great for certain uses like investing. A short-term volatile currency is horrible for other things like day to day use. These are mutually exclusive and can both be true. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:21:04
And that's the main crux of it. In order to get a good enough return on the amount of time needed to implement a Bitcoin payment method (either BTC straight up or converted) you need to have people who can actually pay with BTC. Until it's really stable, people are either not going to want to buy into it, or want to keep their BTC as long as possible in case it spikes up again. Either way, you don't have people actually using the payment system you worked so hard to integrate.

So now that I've proved you wrong, you resort to name calling. Good job. You clearly are good at debating. 
Find me a place with email support that has a short response time. Because they're so exceptionally rare.

Right but the problem with a p2p solution is that the list of auctions needs to constantly be exchanged between users. A person is not guaranteed to have the most current list, and it might be a while before a bid/item shows up for everyone. And then how do you deal with bids on the same item? If person 1 and person 2 bid at similar times, then how do you spread who was successful in their bid throughout the network so that person 2 can bid again if their bid didn't go through successfully (because of person 1's bid).
The issue with Auctions as a decentralized system is that auctions, inherently, are centralized. Even non-digital auctions occur in a centralized environment. You need a very quick way to announce to everyone who is bidding on what, and a decentralized system is not conducive to that sort of distribution.

Oh my, is the scary neckbeard going to come after me now? I'm just pissing my pants in fear. 
You are making ridiculous claims without knowing anything about their development practices nor architecture discussions and decisions that may have happened. You are acting as an inside observer when in fact you are completely on the outside. 
So yes, you do seem to have a vendetta against the company. For really no reason. You act as if they are the apocalypse for what they have done. Everyone makes mistakes, nobody is perfect. 
And it doesn't matter if you alerted them in advance. If bugs are due to early decisions, you would have had to be there alerting them for it to not count as hindsight. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:25:09
I really don't think they'd have enough for servers, which are also expensive, along with colocation, and then on top of that *several* specialized developers.
As was said elsewhere in the thread, they've been getting more and more money, but it's still only recently they've come into a lot of money.
Finding new developers also takes a long time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:23
The magical chart fairy, of course.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:15:26
Do you know how expensive programmers are? It's pricy to hire a competent developer who would actually be able to do it, more for someone who is in that specialized area.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:30:59
They haven't had the kind of money they have now for all of the two years.
You can't exactly buy up lots of talent and build a huge platform overnight, nor can you do it when you start and have nothing. Hiring takes time, development takes time.
You clearly don't work in CS, or you would know this. You can't just snap your finger and get lots of developer and a new platform instantly.
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:59:08


Is it that hard to go look in a dictionary? I've given you examples of it, called it by other names. How hard is it for you to actually *gasp* do some work. 
And you haven't shown me a quick response time. So unless you do, quit trying to be macho cause you're failing. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:41:23
I'm pretty sure he meant give an alternative solution for Mt. Gox policies given the present state of Bitcoins.
It doesn't do jack squat to talk about theoreticals. If there were several solid exchanges then the policy in place is great. You don't like the policy in place, so propose an alternative that could be implemented right now.
@_date: 2013-09-28 23:52:02
No it's not. Because the support team, by design, should not have access to inner workings of a company, nor anything but the most surface level of information and actions available. 
As I said before, you have unrealistic expectations of the support structure of a company and acceptable response times. You should not go into customer service or own a company. You wouldn't do well in it. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:02:50
In some incredibly niche locations, sure. And a few online places here and there. Nobody big is accepting them as of now, and it won't happen for a long time because of stability concerns.
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:37:16
Because you're not going to get enough business transactions out of it to justify supporting Bitpay. There's not enough people using them as currency to justify setting it up. When it becomes more popular, sure, it'll be good. But right now, I wouldn't see myself taking the time to implement it. I wouldn't get that much more business out of it.
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:44:49
It's totally E.
@_date: 2013-09-28 03:16:48
Uhh... What? 6-12 hours is *amazing* for non-instant support (chat, phone).
@_date: 2013-09-28 06:21:03


Uh, what? No it's not. It should be, but it's far from "standard practice.


You seem to both have a vendetta, and not understand what a bug is. You can't claim to know what an "**expected** consequence" is unless you were there during the architecture design meetings and were privy to their conversations. Just because you think you can magically expect all these things doesn't mean everyone can, and I can assure you, you probably wouldn't have thought of a million things. Hindsight is 20/20 after all.
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:03:00
In any. When you're dealing with asynchronous responses, especially ones that loop in multiple people, a 24-48 hour response time is the norm.
It's impossible to have quick replies at all hours when you are dealing with several people at once, as is normal with email contact forms and the such.
You clearly have wildly deluded expectations. I hope you don't run any kind of business in the future, because your expectations are wholly unrealistic and impossible in the real world.

The foundation is in Seattle.

It's an obvious joke. The amount increases as you get further along.

I have heard it called that internally at some places I've worked. 
@_date: 2013-09-29 03:40:58
And you clearly don't understand what asynchronous support is.
@_date: 2013-05-28 00:36:06
Well let's see  requires some sort of system set up,  either requires some sort of automated system or manual processing of orders set up.
The problem I have is with the amount of time you need to invest to support not that many people buying things from you. Bitcoin, as a currency, is incredibly niche. You're not going to get a lot of extra sales just because you're now supporting Bitcoin, so it's not worth taking the time to integrate the payment system. If and when the currency is more used, I don't disagree at all with the system you provided. But for now, it's just not worth it to take the time to implement Bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2013-06-03 07:18:11
Auctions generally require some sort of centralized infrastructure to be able to work. Doing it in a P2P fashion doesn't wholly make sense because you won't have the ability to reach the full potential of your market (if the auction hasn't reached them in the network).
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:54:44
Sure, but you still have to take time to integrate that solution into your payment handling process. And that takes time, which I personally wouldn't spend unless I had a good amount of stability, especially after the instability the currency saw a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:30:46
I highly disagree. To make it useful for payments of any sort, it needs to have far more stability than 10 days. There's a decently high amount of work needed to accept Bitcoin and I definitely wouldn't put in that amount of work unless I had a few weeks worth of stability.
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:33:30
We've been talking about email and non-instant support this entire time. 
You're the one that said that 6 hour response times are atrocious. You're the one that claimed to know all about support in the industry. I've asked you several times to show me examples of this unrealistic response time. You haven't yet. 
So, one more time, show me **non-instant** support such as email with a **&lt;6 hour response time** that is in some sort of technology company. You won't find many, so good luck. 
Edit: Just for shits and gigs, I looked up some big companies' support response times.
[Apple]( is at 24 hours. [Microsoft]( is one business day.
