The Bitcoin network is not susceptible to a tradtional computer virus because of the huge variation in mining hardware. You could take all the windows machines out the network, you could take all the Linux machines out but the ASIC's will still be running.
In theory it might be possible to create a super virus capable of infecting everything but then you have to wonder.... why stop at Bitcoin? Someone able to infect such a global world wide network running on such a huge variation of equipment would have enough power to cripple any system in the world. The likelihood of any such virus coming about is pretty much nil unless there is a super A.I virus sent from the future.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:36:39


The bitcoin network recognizes any valid address and your private key is the proof that you "own" that address.
There are a fixed number of bitcoin wallets so as long as the address format is valid it's a usable address. It only needs a connection when you want to spend your bitcoin in which case your private key is the proof which allows you to do so.

I think it depends what you are doing with Bitcoin.

I highly doubt it. Someone with the motivation and technical expertise to pull off such a theft isn't about to make a dumb move by trying to sell off their stolen coins through other major exchanges and drive the price down.
An exchange would be a very risky move as it would mean exposing your bank details. Sure they could go get a fake bank account but that's not that easy and again opens you up to some real risk with the local authorities.
If it were me, I would sit on it for a while, probably over a year. During that year I would be building my exit mechanism. It would most likely involve creating a company offering services for Bitcoin which I would setup and run as a front to take the coins in, as long as you pay your tax and sort your accounts out properly nobody need know any better.
It's not just Bitcoin community you need to fool, you need to explain to the authorities how you suddenly became rich. It's quite easy to do that if you have a successful company that is paying tax.

A little disappointing that you have to wait until full identity verification before doing anything.

That being said I think the online voucher code is a bit strange. It means you buy the bitcoin and then go home with the voucher in order to have it transferred to your wallet? Or do it with your phone in the shop?
Either way I think the actual exchange could be done a bit better, as it stands you are walking away with a voucher code which may or may not be redeemable.

Difficulty is a relative term. It might not be difficult for you but I'm quite certain it's difficult for the vast majority of people.
And again, like the other poster, you fail to recognize my key point, usability. We already know _how_to secure our wallets, it's just the process is not well understood by everyone and involves solid knowledge to feel confident enough to store ones life savings. Not everyone even has a PC at home to run Electrum or Multibit and storing it on your phone is just asking for trouble unless you really know what you are doing.
Storing your coins on your home machine seems totally archaic to me, just as much as it is storing on a paper wallet. We do these things because nothing better has come along, this has to be Bitcoins biggest challenge, bringing usability to the masses.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:43:44
As I say, TA has no place when it comes to Bitcoin. You are referencing material that was written without any thought to Bitcoin whatsoever and applying it to Bitcoin as if it's fact. It doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is a brand new emerging market like never before. There is no accurate reference point.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:19:53
You aren't saying anything we don't already know and you totally ignored the question of usability which was the core point I was making.
Paper wallets are great for long term storage, I have some myself but they aren't for every day usage. It's more like a long term savings account that you can only access physically by going to your bank.
Considering it's 2014 and we all expect to access our data wherever we are, the current solutions for Bitcoin storage are outdated. Not everyone has a PC at home in which to run wallet software or to boot up a linux paper wallet. We need secure solutions for the majority of non-technical people out there.

Because it took a massive event like this to change the rules.

@_date: 2014-02-25 16:33:19
Most definitely. There are all sorts of possible case scenarios as to how they got into this position and I personally think there are lots of issues due to their piss poor management.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:31:03
How can they reassure? By posting the legal contract between them and the bank? That's not likely.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:24:26
Refer you to my statement:


The point I was making is that for an audit to be worthwhile it has to be thorough which means it has to take time which means it will cost lots of money.
If you expect an exchange to conduct these monthly it will cost you in commission because exchanges have to cover their expenses.
So either you accept the increase in rates, or you go somewhere else which is promising to be properly audited but instead is just fooling you with a  "shitty useless audit". I'm not saying audits are useless, rather they can be used as a veil of legitimacy to fool you into trusting them.

Seems like they are bricking themselves and going way overboard.

I'm trying to avoid making a distinction between good-enough and not-quite good enough. I think we need a solution that is simply secure and usable. If it's good for storing £100k then it's good for storing 10p. I would rather we started at the top than the bottom if that makes sense?
Though I do use Blockchain, think I've got 3-4 coin in my wallet which is about my limit before I start getting worried and move it to my cold wallet.


It's 2014. The concept of storing your coins on your home machine is simply archaic. This is the age of 24x7 communications where you can securely store your information all around the world yet here we are telling people to install a secure wallet on their machine as the primary store for real money. It's the equivalent of telling people to store their cash in a safe at home.
My wallets are encrypted and spread around. They are in quite a few places and hopefully I won't ever forget the password, though I have been meaning to put the password somewhere as a last resort should I forget the password but then I have to write down where I've saved the password....

This is exactly as I said in my first post but trusting yourself to store Bitcoins isn't feasible for the majority of people especially when you consider storing large sums of money.
Also remember that you have to trust a whole lot more than just yourself. You have to trust the software you are using and the people who are telling you it's trustworthy. Step out of your shoes and consider what it's like for a newcomer to Bitcoin who isn't very technical but who wants to use it. It's a minefield.
As I say, I think this is one of the biggest challenges that we have to face, the current implementations are simply not good enough for mass adoption. If it carries on like this Bitcoin will end up becoming way more centralized than we think. Eg, relying upon institutions like Paypal to handle our money with Bitcoin in the background rather than the free and open de-centralized currency we would like it to be.

The market fluctuates heavily in both a bull and bear market so it's no guarantee either way for a company that constantly needs to liquidate.

That isn't a great argument. Simply because something doesn't work 100% of the time every time, doesn't mean it's useless. What you don't know is all the potential problems that might have occurred had there been no regulation at all.
Regulation isn't a cure all and shouldn't be thought of as ALL or nothing. Regulation can and does well. It doesn't have to be government mandated, many sectors are self regulated, with open and transparent policies.
We are seeing it already, exchanges are queuing up to release information for audit, it may be that the future of bitcoin involves an independent regulatory body which the various exchanges volunteer co-operation.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:09:45


If you have 100,000+ stolen coins it really doesn't matter whether the price is $100 or $7000 because it's impossible to withdraw them quickly. In fact the higher the price the more difficult it will be to realize full returns on all of the Bitcoin. So it doesn't matter what the exchange rate is. What matters is their ability to safely withdraw as much Bitcoin as possible and the only strategy for that is a slow methodical approach to withdrawing coins over a long period of time.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:29:57
Bitcoin doesn't take 60 seconds. Your transaction can be noticed in seconds but you need to wait up to 10 minutes to get a confirmation in the blockchain and most recommend waiting for 3 confirmations before accepting the money.
For a coffeeshop or typical retail environment they don't have to wait 10 minutes they can just accept the payment. The risk of double spending is no different in that case (and much harder to pull off) than traditional credit card fraud which retailers accept all the time.
If you were to buy a car or make a large transaction then retailers would enforce a 20-30 minute detail before the goods exchange hands.

e.g 2 people send person X some money. One of them is using stolen funds, the other using legitimate funds. We can trace where person X sends coins but we have no idea which of those coins is stolen and which of those are legitimate because a bitcoin does not have a "unique ID". So a thief can clean his coins quite easily. There are lots of coin mixing services which will do this for a free or another favourite is using gambling sites like satoshi dice which payout over 98%.
A bad analogy: You have some stolen cash and you buy a drink from a vending machine and you get most your money back in change, all of it completely unrelated to the original stolen money. Now imagine if there are hundreds of machines in use 24x7 by people doing the same thing, some of them legit, some of them not.

Who said anything about Bitcoin trading? That is just 1 use of a bank account for Bitcoin. For these banks it's not a Bitcoin issue it's a money laundering issue. When you have customers pumping cash into your accounts and then you are sending cash back all over the place it starts to look like a money laundering operation and banks don't want anything to do with that.
Lots of businesses are conducting Bitcoin business without the worry of their accounts closing overnight. Telling your bank that you are running a Bitcoin business is no protection, they will still close your account if they feel like it as this is a totally unregulated market.

Have you stress tested these things? The thing with aluminum is that it flexes and the problem with anodizing is that it doesn't like flexing and will quite quickly chip and flake.
My suggestion for cards with the private key would be to repeat them twice on both sides of the cards - reversed plus adding the text key rather than just the QR code.
This means you have some redundancy built into the card should it get bent or chipped and become unreadable.

Nothing will ever happen to him.
He didn't take any money, he just offered a wager, as a friend might offer you. There is no contract there and he didn't take any money. The fact he didn't pay out was obvious, he took tens of thousands in bets, he was never going to be able to pay.
@_date: 2012-09-10 09:43:19
OK so now you are arguing over semantics?
The fact is, there is no way to "trace" the transactions to an individual. Thus it's untraceable. You might be able to see what transactions have occurred, that is the p2p nature of the system, but that is mostly irrelevant because there are many ways to mix your coins.

That is a terrible critique because almost every business goes through this.
They require funds upfront to allow them to research, design and build the ASIC equipment. The opted to pre-orders, presumably because traditional credit was too hard to come by.

I had a few beers at lunch so I mistyped "If I were MtGox". If that is the best you can come up with this should be a breeze.
**&gt;It has everything to do with Security Through Obscurity.**
Hahaha.... No really. LOL. That's the only argument you can come up with for MtGox not hiring outsiders? Because that is pathetic.
I've got 15 years experience working at the cutting edge of IT across multiple sectors. High value e-commerce sites taking £5m a day, massive data warehousing projects, parallel and highly salable computing. I've worked with clients with extremely sensitive information and from where I am standing your objection to hiring a developer makes no fucking sense.
If you had any sort of serious real world understanding of these issues you would understand there are many different ways to mitigate the risk of exposing your codebase or sensitive information to developers, outside or otherwise. Companies would be crippled otherwise.

Yes, companies like Bitpay and intermediaries are required in the short to medium term. The problem is that they hold the risk but what happens when it all falls over and the company goes bankrupt? It's little help to the small business who has a large chunk of cash waiting to be processed. So ultimately these things may take time to be established before people have too much faith in them.

I think you are making some massive assumptions there.
MTGOX have certainly created a lot of issues because of the amount of BTC that passes through their systems. There have been lots and lots of smaller incidents going back the last few weeks where GoxLag was causing massive panic sell offs. When you've got an hour trading lag nobody knows what is going on, they just want to get out.
So yes, MtGox have had a direct part to play in the last two major incidents. But then we all knew that was going to happen as they have such a huge market share.

In the business world, hiring new people or opening contracts with other companies is done every day. If you do the correct due diligence and you have contracts in place, there is no reason why you should be so afraid.
If I were ~~Bitcoin~~ **MtGox** I would hire a local development company, I would go to their offices, I would speak with their C-level guys, I would check their historical work, I would speak with their references, I would then open a contract on a trial basis.

Absolutely. They would essentially become a bitcoin exchange with OTC locations for buying/selling. Seems like the smartest move they could make. They already deal with a shit load of dodgy money, this isn't a hard market for them to deal with.

@_date: 2013-12-06 14:47:11
People buying/selling on bittylicious/localbitcoins are most likely doing so outside of the law because they are probably not declaring these payments as income and if they are, they will be under the VAT limit so won't be doing much business at all. My small business is registered for VAT (all businesses must over a certain turnover) which means if I sell Bitcoins I have to charge 20% VAT. So either my coins are 20% over market rate, or I personally take a 20% cut which is not feasible. Secondly the banks are extremely averse to any kind of dealings with bitcoin and if they get a sniff you are trading in it, your bank account will be shut pronto. It's happened lots and lots of companies in the past 2-3 years.
I did invest £5k into bitcoins before consulting with my accountant. He has told me now that the minute I sell those back and take the cash expect to pay 20% of that straight to the tax man, even if I sell em for the same price I bought em at. So I'm never gonna sell em at least until HMRC classify them different. If the taxman asks I'll show him my paper wallet which is stored along with the rest of my company documents. ;)

Fucking hell slow down. The point is that many people see Bitcoin as an investment only, they want to buy low and sell high. What they may not realize realize is that for that price to be sustainable, Bitcoin needs to have some basis for it's value. When you buy and spend bitcoin you are hugely benefiting the bitcoin economy, the more people buying and spending Bitcoin the higher the price will go and the more stable it will be. Nobody is saying saving is bad, all this post is saying is that if you want to help Bitcoin, buying and spending is a great way.
If you are gonna buy something with fiat money and an opportunity arises to use bitcoin, spend the bitcoin and put the fiat money back into your BTC savings. That way you are helping the wheels turn.

It's called purchasing power and in your example, apple buyers and sellers would rely upon some sort of mechanism to help them determine the price, that would then tell you how much you could buy with a bitcoin.
The same happens today in many markets. For example scrap metal. Who sets the price of scrap metal? The buyers and sellers, then are companies with aggregate that price and supply a figure for other companies to use if they don't have a direct line into that market to be able to determine the price for themselves.

Um because when you sell a Lambo today for 200BTC and then tomorrow the price crashes to 600USD, suddenly you are massively out of pocket and possibly facing bankruptcy. Of course if you take the long term and say that any sales you make you will save for the future value of Bitcoin which means you aren't really accepting Bitcoin for liquidity but as a long term investment. Most businesses don't want their daily turnover to be a long term investment gamble, they need that money today so they can keep buying stock.

Virgin are very cheap, but that is why they get so many service complaints. AAISP are expensive but the upshot is a very solid and reliable service. Two different kettles of fish. I don't actually use AAISP anymore, as I wanted FTTC Fiber and they didn't offer it yet when I got my Sky Fiber. So I just pay £5/month for a VPN on top.

I'll believe it when I see it. I've been within Bitcoin in the UK for a while now and it's simply not feasible to legally accept bitcoin, it causes all sorts of problems accounting for it because of the way HMRC classify them.

Funny because a shit load of average americans are using it already. Or are you saying they aren't average? What the fuck is an average american anyway?

That seems like a really big failure for security if you ask me. So even if you wanted to self-sign you could get fucked over by a 10 second domain validated SSL without even knowing about it. What a a joke.

You are wrong because I have spent a vast chunk of my bitcoin without relying upon an escrow.
Usually I build up trust with a supplier first using escrow then after a few transactions I stop using escrow and instead trust the seller directly.
I don't know what point you are trying to make but I don't think it's a very good one. There is no perfect system here when it comes to exchanging money with a seller. It's all a trade between your trust and the risk involved. you say the issue is brushed over, well that's because it's not an issue bitcoin can solve nor can any currency system.
As I said before it comes down to trust. If you are going to buy something you must trust someone. Either trust the seller or trust an Escrow. If you are unwilling to do either then you won't be able to do much business with your bitcoin. The same is really for anything anywhere. When you buy with your credit card you trust your CC company will back you up if things go wrong. Why do we trust credit card companies? It's something they have built up over time. The same is said for any bitcoin escrow service.
As I said, I have spent 600+ bitcoins and I have not had a single transaction go foul.

That's bullshit. But I'll give you $20 bitcoin tip if it's true.

Nah they do that themselves already.

That's an easy statement to make but when you think about it, what possibly would they gain from destroying a crypto-currency? Any gains would be short-term, there are already competing crypto currencies that will be picked up. Not to mention how much negative feeling it will generate if they were seem to be involved in such an attack on what is essentially a free market idea.

Which pretty much makes it unfeasible. who wants to pay 20% VAT ontop of whatever fee's they need to make for this to be worthwhile?
It will be like buying a £50 UKASH voucher to spend £20 of bitcoin online.

I did not know that actually, learn something new every day. I have always used it to describe general shit information.
Having ridden three bitcoin bubbles live this information scares me. This is the sort of information that starts to come out at the tail end of hysteria as genuine information dries up and people want to keep ship going.

This would be SOOO good for the economy. Just think how many bitcoins NewEgg will be taking and will have to liquidate, that's gonna be a nice chunk of volume to keep the wheels turning at the exchanges.

I got a e-mail back today about a £5k deposit into BitStamp I made 4 days ago, making me jump through fucking hoops just to deposit money because I sent it from my business account. Fucking joke.

Yes you can, you can submerge your PC in mineral oil no problem.

And you are stroking your high horse penis. Who gives a fuck what he paid, he paid BTC for a fucking plane ticket. So what if he paid a little more than retail. It's fucking BIT COIN FOR A PLANE TICKET.

Except that I simply don't believe this article is true, the regulation in the UK is stacked against Bitcoin big time. I've had my accountant look into this and it's not economically feasible to exchange/sell bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:35:24
True that. With that much money he should be able to sort this out and have a full time security team making sure the site is secure.

Whether its £5k or £10k, if you are doing anywhere near that much in daily turnover, you should be doing it legally or you might just shit your pants when the tax man comes knocking and asks you to firstly pay VAT on all those payments and then secondly pay TAX on your income.
Of course people avoid tax all the time and may be happy to do it short term but long term it's impossible to build a big business upon exchanging Bitcoin here in the UK. That's why the OTC p2p type payments with bittylicious are a great way for us to keep exchanging bitcoin, though it relys upon lots of people basically subverting the law to make it possible.
I'm currently working on launching a UK B2C business to primarily accept Bitcoin, it's getting there but the financials are going to be interesting.

Well there is going to come a point where miners won't process unless a fee is attached. It costs miners money to process, thats why the fee is there.

The only way to have a distributed stock exchange is to have a distributed artificial intelligence, aka, SKYNET.
Otherwise no amount of coding is going to get around the fact that people need to exchange FIAT (USD, GBP, Euros, etc..) into something digital which can then be traded.
Unless you just want to trade bitcoins with other digital de-centralised currencies, in which case it's very doable.
