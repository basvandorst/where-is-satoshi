Who is this economic majority, and what % do they represent, of what exactly? Why would businesses that have yet to prove their business models be elevated to such relevance?
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:00:42
This discussion should be first about vision and then economics. Inverting, or mixing, the two is what is causing all this confusion.

Am I being a party spoiler for pointing out that this is an obvious April 01 joke?
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:51:57
Sure, agreed. But not publicly. Selling a product while at the same time energetically seeding doubts about it just doesn't make a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:51:24
It's his right to deliver the message he believes in. It's shows bad taste to publicly denounce the character of core developers, especially considering this was meant to be a closed event. It comes down to what I've said before: it's now do or die for him. If core prevails he will have lost his credibility in the ecosystem, and he choose to go down this road. Live by the sword and die by the sword....

This is his plan to save his business model, not necessarily Bitcoin. Accepting an invitation and publicly mocking other participants shows little class and inflames this issue only further. His shareholders should hold him accountable when his gamble does not work out.
@_date: 2016-03-20 11:09:46
Who is this 'community as a whole'? All I can tell at this moment is that 95% of miners and about 2/3 of nodes are supporting core.

Good coup for Coinbase. As a side effect, this also probably means that BA has received (or soon will) binding advice to tone down his rhetoric. You can't penetrate these kind of markets while simultaneously put doubt in participants' minds why they should be involved in the first place
@_date: 2016-01-22 10:32:33
And? Newcomers can't ask any questions?
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:39:40
Terrible post which no one should take serious. 
Even if they'd have cash flow issues - like almost any startup is confronted with - they are are a legitimate business with high quality backers who have done a great deal for Bitcoin.
At worst they'd need a serious pivot. Again, nothing new for a startup.

BTC moving between wallets and exchanges to manipulate the market? Look at the price movements this past week
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:51:08
Agree. This is something core should be communicating to the larger ecosystem instead of just relying on developer channels. Being right and having others acknowledge such can be two entirely different things.
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:59:56
Brian just put his job on the line, surely he must realize this. Let's await the wisdom of his decision
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:55:20
I don't. I can only analyze and infer. But I don't believe in too many coincidences.
As an example, yesterday there was a cornering of the market by making placing long bets difficult and costly (extremely low liquidity and relatively high borrowing costs). Was this tied to the announcement by Chinese miners that they would be supporting core? Who would benefit from a big price drop, in terms of PR ('the market doesn't support the miners' decision')? Who has a sufficient amount of BTC to pull this off and could be secure that the manipulation was relatively safe, even in quite volatile general market conditions?
Let's see what happen next week when supposedly classic will make an important announcement. The timing and direction of the first big market move could be telling. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:07:29
With little time left for a classic hard fork to come into effect before Segwit is deployed (considering it needs a 28 day grace period), this kind of campaigning is no surprise. One wonders, however, what kind of bomb will be dropped within the next two weeks as the final desperate attempt to turn the tide. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 01:53:23
You're right saying in a responsible manner. I suspect that classic will come with an announcement next week that they'll commence the hard fork, quite possibly before Segwit is deployed.
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:13:08
But it is a cause when the big price movements are orchestrated by insiders which I suspect to be the case more often than not. It seems to me that this price manipulation is used both as a PR as well as a funding tool. Obviously many other factors play a role as well, but with few exceptions don't cause these huge price swings. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:47:23
What the ecosystem experiences, and what people most notice and talk about, are the huge price swings. These are to be expected for a nascent technology such as BTC, but insider market manipulation to - what I assume is the creation of a 'war chest' - is avoidable and unethical
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:50:17
Can anyone from classic provide a concrete example where such a voting system has worked for a project of this size, complexity, and significance? Considering their projected confidence there must be successful precedents, right? Please enlighten.
@_date: 2016-01-30 00:04:43
You realize that in every field experts are highly overrated, right? Some examples: 80% of investment professionals underperform the market over time, millions of people get misdiagnosed, and an estimated 40% of business value gets lost due to so-called expert decision making. At this time the issue here is not economic expertise, rather it is about what vision you believe in. This will drive everything else. And as they say, follow the money when analyzing both camps.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:52:02
A failure in governance? To me it seems that the processes put in place by core have proven (at this time) to work by and large. Like any other large project, there is always room for improvement. Contrast this with a governance structure of classic that is an unsophisticated and unproven voting system, about which any behavioral or decision making expert will telll you that it is extremely vulnerable to all sorts of biases, such as group think, herding behavior, and echo chamber effect. Not to mention that it is run by the brother of one of the main classic creators. I mean, how can this seriously be considered a better alternative?
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:39:19
It doesn't matter what you think of me. What does matter (naively or not) is that this self entitled behavior damages the growth of the ecosystem and turns people off from buying coins. It's exactly what gives BTC a bad rap. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:04:57
You're making a framing error. Bitcoin development at this stage should not be compared to regular (no matter how complex) software development but instead, for instance, to what was required to put a man on the moon. In other words, there is little to no room for error. And there is only one shot at create a foundation that is truly fool proof.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:30:40
I agree, but more from a principled rather than a risk driven perspective at this time. Particularly the Chinese miners appreciate the time and hard efforts that core has placed into creating and growing the system. They (rightfully) understand and respect this. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:29:47
You seem like an intelligent guy, but also one that argues for the point (love) of arguing. This is not always productive. Nevertheless, here are some quick rebuttals: 
1. The old adage of 'don't fix it if it ain't broke' is just so much more applicable at this time. Please provide a concrete example where an open democratic system has successfully executed a project of this scale. 
2. Thanks for pointing out the - what must have been a fairly recent - change on the classic homepage. I guess everyone is looking forward to seeing what concrete governance model will be ultimately applied. Care to share when this will be announced?
3. It does matter who builds and oversees it. Good governance is all about checks and balances, and which don't leave any room for opaqueness. It's just not smart practice in my opinion to even give the slightest impression of possible future conflicts of interests. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 01:25:07
Not at all. This is the plan to have three teams: communication, development, implementation 
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:05:39
This is around the time that the long squeeze was adjusted.
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:12:58
Thanks for a great explanation. On top of this (and I simply don't know) what exactly are the transactions that are supposedly about to overwhelm the current block size limit, how important are those at this moment, and how much would the fee(s) increase for these kind of transactions, if the block size 'only' increases by 1.6 times? Quantity and quality might be different beasts.
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:26:11
Why don't his VC backers install a second c-suite within his own company and see how that works out for him. It's just so naive to believe that such a high potential, but totally fledgling, system such as Bitcoin can be effectively scaled by having competing teams, at least for the foreseeable future. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 10:01:38
One possibility is self funding through market manipulation. Andersen and Garzik are self proclaimed and proud traders, with an enormous amount of timely inside information.
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:22:02
Does an indisputable, and available, overview exist of the current kind of transactions, which ones are growing fastest, and what their current and possibly increased fee is compared to alternatives?
