Thanks for the response. I went to my addresses tab, and it lists all of my addresses. I click receiving, and then my address to where the BTC was sent shows up under 'used'.
When I go to the console, this is the text that I see:

Just FYI, I sent a $20 tip from my coinbase wallet right after that last message, and there's still 0 confirmations lol. It'll get there eventually, but that's the slowest I've ever seen from Coinbase jeez

I believe I did do that. I followed the steps from a thread here. Do you have the time to explain exactly what I should do? I uninstalled electron cash but can re-install it

I have a wallet on coinbase, can I just generat a new address on my coinbase wallet, or do I need to download an entire new program like bitcoin core or blockchain and create a new wallet, then import my private keys from the address the money was sent to?

Okay, I just re-installed Electrum (I was on 2.7.1 or something) and now I can see my BTC. Phew. Had never had this problem in years using BTC/Electrum. Thanks. Shoot me a BTC address for helping me out man

Okay, I've never had this problem before, and the transaction was almost 16 hours ago, but I will change servers. Right now I have 'Select server automatically' selected. In the past, I would always at least get a pending status when receiving coins, immediately after the sender had sent, which makes me think that address is no longer connected to this wallet, or the private keys were sent to electroncash, or something.
So I can just switch to any random server on this list until I find one that is up to date?

Blockchain: 487501 blocks.
Getting block headers from 4 nodes.
Server: electrum3.hachre.de
I should note that when I told this person to send me bitcoin, they already my address from before (the one the coins got sent to), but I had actually created a new address for them to send to, on the same electrum wallet. But since they had sent to me before, they disregarded my message and just sent to my old address. This address was always assigned to my electrum wallet. I don't think this would affect anything but I just wanted to point that out.
This is the first time I've had any trouble receiving BTC on electrum, and it's also the first time I've tried receiving BTC after the fork when I downloaded Electroncash and retrieved my BCC

Okay, so what exactly do I do once I create the new wallet on new software? sweep the keys or something? Thanks for the help, google doesn't say much
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:39:45
Yes, I am back on normal electrum, and it is not showing up in my balance. These are the only procedures I followed in order to retrieve my BCC about a month ago (1 minute vid)  
If you can help me retrieve my coins I will give you a reward. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:15:25
Okay, thanks for the reply. So just download electrum on a different machine and make a new wallet, and sign in with the same user name? How will that help me retrieve my BTC? I'm surprised Google doesn't say anything about this. It was quite a lot of money; if you can help me find a solution I'll send you $100 
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:43:06
I think you're onto something, as the BTC was sent at block height 487,871, and I am on 487,501. Every time I choose a new network, it says "not connected" in the bottom left corner where it normally shows my balance.
I just tried manually loading a transaction from the blockchain (tools &gt; load transaction &gt; from the blockchain, and a box with the transaction ID pops up, and I entered the transaction ID) and it gave me the error code 'Server did not answer'

 I can't remember exactly what I did, but I think I watched this video and did this
