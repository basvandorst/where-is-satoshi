Can't tell if joke or you are retarded

That doesn't mean bitcoin will reach 238x what gold is. Or anything like that. People will only pay what they are willing to.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:09:48
Well in a sort of way it really is.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:47:41
Why do you buy bitcoins?

I think it's funny how one site does "80%" of all transactions.
@_date: 2013-09-07 02:46:12
This is what I don't understand. Half you people say it's going to increase 1000000000x over the next x years, and the other half say "Well if you use ASIC crap it won't profit". Everybody is contradicting each other. 
Yes, ASIC in the short term is unprofitable, but if the price of bitcoins constantly goes up, you're bound to make back your investment overtime. So what happens if I mine a BTC, and then over the next 5 years it triples in value. I obviously got my money worth.

You could say this about any currency throughout history. My $1 to gold in 1990 was vastly lower than it is now.

Heh look at my comments again. Kinda funny how stupid people are in this subreddit and the general community. Made quite a bit of money off that little USB asic in the past months.

think you forgot verify

I think the biggest flaw in this whole scheme is that technically anyone could make a currency, and that's where this will fall flat. We're already at what 10? digital currency? The more popular this becomes, the more and more others will come.

As someone who trades Forex daily, I see a major problem coming with volume. As more and more get into this, there will be major liquidity problems and problems filling orders.
Coupled with the fact that the "market" is now being diluted with new digital currencies, people are simply jumping from one to other as they fail to hold confidence in one.
Also, because there is absolutely no regulation, companies can "misplace" your coins, or even just say you got it.

Look at the chart for XAUUSD, and notice how up until 2008 it had a pretty set curve. And then look what happened after 2008 and 2011. Any sort of bank or government regulation will completely fuck this all up.
@_date: 2013-09-07 15:57:41
Right. I think people are looking at bitcoin the wrong way. I work with Forex and Forex companies, and I understand how the markets work. There's not enough volatility or volume to really make much money in short term trades. Sure you could scalp a few coins assuming the price fluctuates, but the real key here (for now) is long term investing. Even though the price does drop every now and then, there is a VERY common trend similar to how gold was before 2008. As bitcoin gains more market share, the price of 1 coin *should* go up. So even if you have 1 BTC right now you could see it grow tremendously. Look at the price just a year or so ago and now.

It will never get that high. The market can only support what people are willing to pay. If gold is sitting at 1700, then there's no fucking way a non metal will get that high.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:44:22
It only took gold 10000 years to get here, Oh and don't worry, if this "threatens the establishment" you bet there will be some serious fucking regulations.

Does your calculation of loss include inflation (USD &lt;-&gt; BTC) rising over the next years? You could possibly obtain coins now at a loss, that will rise in value later. Assuming there is no major crash to the currency.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:26:09
The market will be flooded soon with so many it will be diluted.
@_date: 2013-09-04 01:37:01
Late, but that also doesn't take into consideration that the price of 1 BTC is constantly rising.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:41:43
As a forex trader and person who works with thousands of traders a year, this post is the exact reason I am profitable. Thank you. I don't even understand this because I easily made 30% the past few weeks. Trading BTC is stupid easy right now. 
But we all know this is a fake post
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:21:46
Just wait until the banks get their hands on it. The scary thing is, this proves anyone can make a currency. Can't wait for my BoA bucks.
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:57:26
Right and that's what I feel a lot are missing. This is exactly how banks make money. The major turning point in all of this is getting new brokers on the field and merchants. As soon as that happens, your 20 bitcoins instantly starts rising in value.
Just like how we saw it spike to 200-300 a few months ago.
