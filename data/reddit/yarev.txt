Damn, nothing in mine yet. How long did you order?

Is that what they do? They use the value that was relevant when the zipzap payment went through?

I bought bitcoins from them 2 days ago via moneygram to btc address. Nothing yet. I contacted them multiple times and the two times they've responded with the same copy-paste message telling me to wait and that it will be "resolved in the next business day." If they are scamming, they are probably hoping the buyer will just let it slide. Fuck that, I'm not giving up until I get my order or my money back.

I bought coins from bitinstant five fucking hours ago I already messaged them TWICE and each time I got a big fuck-you in the form of "Likely tommorow"
It's like they are holding the coins just because of this volatile shit

Oh man I'm gonna be fucking pissed if my coins come to my address in the middle of the night and the price crashes during the morning

Technical difficulties? I made a deposit today as well and it's four hours later and it's STILL not in my blockchain account. They told me they'd have to manually transfer too.

Which customer support, bitinstant or moneygram?

Same situation here. This is some shit. I've deposited money to my bitcoin address almost 24 hours ago and it's still yet to go through. I've been told that it's supposed to come through today, but still no sign of my coins. What makes it even worse is that they took down the deposit &gt; btc address payment option.

I also keep hearing bitfloor charges like half the fees of bitinstant.

Damn, been 4 hours, still nothing. :(
