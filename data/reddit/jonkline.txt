If mining stays as PoW, eventually, the people who hold lots of BTC will be the ones paying for mining. Just like billionaires pay politicians to keep the social order now, those holding BTC will have incentives to keep BTC's ledger accurate.

But the problem is this completely destroys the anonymity of BTC. Are you going to tie a single address to a single address? So now, my boss can see how much my other boss is paying me? And how much is left at the end of the month? No respectable wallet uses a single address.
To do it right would require generating a private key relating to the email address. And then developing and using a protocol for Gmail to provide the unique public key as it was requested to each requester. Without opening the system up to abuse, DDoS, and hacks. 
Whoever builds this thing, that seems really simple but isn't, gets it to market, and markets it tirelessly until it gets wide adoption, will be making the next Chase or AT&amp;T or Google.

The kind of people that get excited about user experience design are not often the same people that get excited about encryption and economics. It's going to take some time and money before these big ideas get implemented in a wave of populism. 
Tim Berners-Lee and his compatriots designed a protocol. They didn't design the websites. The same is true for cryptos.
We don't go to the internet to get http, we go to get well-designed content. We don't go to our wallets to get Bitcoin, we go to them to pay for things. When cryptocurrency makes paying for things easier, without sacrificing whatever people require, people will use it.

Every transaction is has a failsafe built in. If the conditions for the transaction fail, it gets reversed.
