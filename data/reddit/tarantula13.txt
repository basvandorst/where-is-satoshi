You do realize what kind of trouble any American company can get in for violating OFAC correct? It's not feasible at all.

It's not like they were advertising something explicitly illegal, they just used a catch all phrase.
It's more like if a shipping company saying you can ship anything and then don't allow you to ship heroin. Don't get upset at companies following the law. It's being way too literal.

Retail banks are a sales position now more than ever. A lot of them try to sell you on the value of having a brick and mortar location. Nothing wrong with it, just the reality we live in.

In response to your other comment:
People can be successful day trading, most people however are in over their heads.
If you are a rookie do not attempt to day trade. You cannot predict the price and you will only lose money via fees from buying and selling.
It doesn't matter if you buy or sell with different companies, but you cannot sell for real money on Mt. Gox. People refer to it as "goxdollars" because the only thing they are good for is buying bitcoins hence the higher price. You cannot withdraw USD from Mt. Gox to put into your bank account.
Before you even attempt to daytrade I highly reccomend you research what you are getting into.

He probably holds the same stance, he is just converting them into dollars.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:32:23
It would probably cost you more to recover than what the bitcoin is worth (if it's even possible at this point).

PM me next time you decide to sell please.

You can also think that something is right or wrong and that doesn't make you universally correct.
Some people think drugs are immoral, others don't, which means it's subjective, you can't represent it as fact like your Earth example.

Guess that settles that.

You could try mining Litecoin or Dogecoin, less startup costs are required.

Nassor, I suggest you try getting a bank account a second go. I work at a bank and I know all about ChexSystems and how most places auto deny you if you fail that. You need to just go in saying you will fail ChexSystems but you can show proof of income and your savings as of right now. Branch managers have the final say on whether or not you get a bank account and they can give you one even if you do fail ChexSystems. Explain your situation and just keep going to different banks. If you live near a major city, there are dozens of different banks and credit unions that you can try, eventually someone will give you a bank account.

Any bank can shut down any bank account for any reason or none at all. It's their freedom to do so. It's also your freedom to bank with anyone you want. Considering the large libertarian leaning of this subreddit, most people would agree that bank and consumer are entering a voluntary transaction. If the bank doesn't want to be a part of that transaction any more it's their right.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:38:37
Ok? My argument is that morality is subjective and not a universally accepted truth.

You're the one that brought "paid shills" up. I don't understand why you accuse him of dismissing criticism as cult like behavior when you're the one putting words in his mouth.

If you actually do not get your money back you have course for legal action as someone withdrew money from your account without identification of being you. There are no such things as deposit reversals.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:23:19
That doesn't even make sense.
You should go into a prison and tell that to the nonviolent drug offenders.
What the hell kind of post is that?
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:00:49
Morality is pretty subjective.

Bitcoin philosophy does not equal libertarian philosophy. Lots of overlap but it can appealing to other philosophies or just thinking for yourself.

I don't think Peter Schiff was ever against the idea of Bitcoin, he was just warning people to not buy into it and to expect for it to go up because it looked like a bubble. He pretty much said that it is not a sound investment and is very high risk. Since it was anti-bitcoin, a lot of people here took it personally. The truth is that he hates the USD / government and has always been a libertarian guy.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:43:45
I believe in Bitcoin and I'm a a strong supporter, but I also understand that the price could be $1 or it could be $10,000. It's just fiscally irresponsible to have a majority of your holdings in Bitcoin and have the livelihood of a business depend on something out of their control.
Bitcoin would be great for a marijuana business in accepting payments and making payments to suppliers, but I don't think they should be banking Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:30:34
Honest question, why would a business choose to hold in Bitcoin like that? With the price fluctuations I would rather pay up the ass for some sort of vault services which is what they are doing now.

Can't you buy them w/o the transaction fees on the exchange? Or a much lower transaction fee if you are a taker?

I'm much more likely to get hacked or do something stupid than Coinbase is. Not to mention I have some sort of recourse if it's with Coinbase.

I mean you could sell at Coinbase or Bitstamp, they're higher than BTC-e.

Mandatory reporting for a CTR (Currency Transaction Report) is $10,000 in one day. If your transactions in one day add up to that amount it gets sent to the fed 100% of the time. Another report sent to the fed is a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) and those are sent based on the financial institutions discretion.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:40:49
They could at least call it something else.
@_date: 2015-03-23 23:55:44
No? There's no point because there's 20+ business days in a month. You could deposit a few hundred bucks every day or a thousand here and a couple hundred there and achieve the same result. The structuring law is to prevent money laundering. If you deposit $9000 every day or multiple times a week you will certainly be investigated. If it's $9000 once a month the feds really have no interest in you.
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:15:41
Structuring is purposefully avoiding the $10,000 reporting requirements by depositing smaller amounts over time. Something like a few thousand every day or every couple of days. You won't get investigated for structuring for $10,000 over a 3 month period.
@_date: 2015-03-23 21:42:40
The time frame is one day.
