If you open developer / network panel and check the details of that cert... Maybe you have a trojan that installed a self-signed root certificate that allows them to trick your browser into believing you actually are hitting bittrex.com when it really isnt ... what does nslookup bittrex.com say?

Do you guys have a list of comments to reply on? Two other people already told me my comment was incomprehensible. I guess it's something in the water you core boys drink?

Create &amp; run your wallets on:
Air-tight dedicated computer (old laptop, maybe even a raspberry pi). 
Encrypted (with a pwd you keep on paper) virtual machine thats created and run from a guaranteed (freshly, legit, reinstalled) clean host. 
Paper wallets.
If you're a hodler and not overly into encryption/security I recommend you use a hardware wallet and never keep more money than you are willing to lose on exchanges. Even though a hardware wallet like trezor might be suspectable to a really advanced attack like the one above ... theoretically (I dont know enough about how trezor works internally to decided if their site could be manipulated to trick your token). Hopefully not, because that would be a pretty big oversight from their side.

Only difference between 1x and 2x is which companies run it. Both will become government run.  Especially when lightning nodes is the only way for users to communicate on it.

Seriously you need hamsters though. And wheels, a lot of wheels.
