Assuming a bitcoin of 100K
That is an annual mining income of 12.50Bitcoin * 0.1 million USD * 6 Blocks/Hour * 24 Hour * 356Days=64080 million USD/Year (simplifying that income from fees cover everything else beside electricity)
At a market price of 0.05 USD/KWh that converts to 64.080M/0.05Usd/Kwh=1281600M *KWh= 1.282TWh
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504 TWh in 2013
1.282/19.504=6.6% of worldwide electricity!
If it goes up to 1.5 Million it will get dark.
edit: No electricity left to mine altcoins.

easy answer: exchanges(aka casinos) make the most money with altcoin trading. a dominant bitcoin is bad for business. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:41:55
Agrroz - Thanks!.  So in resume, to get to the 0,6% of world electricity, a Bitcoin would need to be worth 15Million. More or less.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:08:33
will the exchanges get away with telling their user: sorry your USDT now lost its value?
If USDT is worth a cent, then it will look like bitcoin is worth million, that would look crazy. I really would like to know what kind of deals the exchanges have with tether. Just cannot imagine they are so crazy to accept tether without getting some kind of security.

besides the 12.5 bitcoin of fixed mining reward, there are also "a few" bitcoins of fees the miner get for each block. but yes, at the end may be less electricity  and more other costs (hardware/ labor)

Greetings here from Panama.
Living in Panama: The economy here has just crashed, good if you make the money somewhere else. Crazy renting cost just returned to normal. If you do not come with a lot of money do not mess with the immigration, just just stay here as tourist.
Bitcoin: You will find a bunch of traders mainly from Venezuela on localbitcoin that do arbitrage trading between Venezuela, Columbia and the rest of the world. Get in contact with some, and you can allays exchange Bitcoin. There is also [ptycoin.com](
Bitcoin is not regulated in Panama. And i think it will stay that way. There two extreme positions in Panama at the same time. On one side the banks get pressured from the USA like crazy against money laundering. So if you use the word Bitcoin in a Panamanian Bank your account is close to be closed. I told my bank that one specific transaction was from localbitcoin and my account got closed. On the other side the same Bank sponsored Bitcoin meetings, and is interested itself to get into it. Many people in the financial sector here are at the point: Panama Papers ruined our business, now we fight back with Bitcoin.
There is a law in the pipe (not sure if it will get approved) for FinTechs to be supervised by the tax authority instead the bank authority. Its idea is to make Panama as "competitive" as possible.
You can also find an active and interesting Bitcoin community here. Erik Voorhees was here working here, and many of the people around him stayed. Search for panafintech.

The problem is not Coinbase. The problem is that people use Coinbase as a bank and not as an exchange.

Yes, it feels really bad. After bitcoin not moving not at all that strong move on a Sunday. Could not feel worse. If i would be a whale i would not sell on a Sunday, instead a day with more volume. That all let me think that the reason of today was only to get a better entry point.

1) store them at three different places. (you will loose at least one) 
2) put plastic tape on both sides. (they can get wet)
3) recover them for example with [electrum.org]( (not [electrum.com](
thanks to 1) and 2) i have not lost my savings!!!

Sorry we can not have bitcoin price at 1M now. ~~Electricity price worldwide would double.~~  Go up about 10%. Its already consuming 66Twh. Governments would declare war on bitcoin. With every halving the electricity consumption get reduced by 50%. So in five years we can moon, but not 1M.
Edit:  **sorry**, I missed a digit. Total electricity is 25.500Twh.  Would be 20%, but as xav-- say bitcoin mining use cheap electricity so may be 10%
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:44:27
The miners get 6B a year. They need to pay electricity and mining equipment. At the next halving they will get the half, so they will spend less on electricity. Or just turn their machines off.  So it will reduce the electricity consumption.
Second point I Agree. People should see the mining in relation with gold mining. The gold mining reward is 135B. (much more than bitcoin) and you can assume that a big part of hat is invested in destroying the environment just to pick up metals.

Me. My bank account is closed now. Today I pick up the check. And I will put it into Bitcoin. But it was a decision made by the bank. They closed the account after I told them that a specific transaction was Localbitcoin. Answer: This is against our policy. Bank in Panama.

The grayscale report indicates a bit over 2B in the first 6 months, that translates to 80M/week.  Coinbase now does the "storing" for grayscale. Maybe he is including this part.

people use it for moving money. the paxful and localbitcoin stats you can see at [ can give you an idea. nearly everybody seem to store their bitcoin on exchanges instead of using a wallet. [ when people do payments mostly it moves from one exchange to another.

i think most people still can work with the actual fees, but when it gets to 10$ or more several uses cases do not work any more. my question is, why not a dynamic block size that focus on stable fees?
if median fee grows bigger then 0.0001BTC then increase block size, otherwise shrink it.
@_date: 2019-04-29 03:25:03
I thought exactly what you wrote when i saw this: [ .
This will put a big challenge to BTC clone coins.
Bitcoin has a dynamic hash rate algo, could bitcoin get more stable fees with a dynamic block size?
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:14:22
Income from fees right now is only 10%. [ If bitcoin security should not get lower on the next halving total income from fees need to get up to 50%.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:11:01
my thought was if a 6000 BTC sell from MtGox cause BTC to drop several thousand, 2170 BTC should be able to cause a 500$ drop.

short answer: 18k.
long answer: prices based on long-term curve analysis made in mid 2017.
the lower amount is in depression mood, the upper amount if we are in boubel mood. the last one is a logarithmic average.
end of 2017 5k-25k  (11k)
end of 2018 8k-40k  (18k) &lt;-- the one you asked.
end of 2019 14k-70k  (31k)
end of 2020 24k-120k (54k)
(the boubel factor as you can see is 5x, but there is an extreme boubel factor of 10x that was only reached one time in end 2013, extreme depression can also be 50% of the lower amount)
the curve can be disrupted by another crypto. but do not look at market cap, look at the number of people having it, and feeling it has value.

bitcoin may not have more features, but its ecosystem has.
bitcoin may even lose its top market cap, but not it biggest userbase (so easy). 
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:25:23
yes. I made some conservative assumptions. it came up that an exponential growth with a small slow down factor fits better. also depends on the moment you do the calculation. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:58:02
I start to think that during the last hype people accumulated to much trash. On Jan 13. Bitcoin was 14k with BTC Dominance: 33%. 
Now we are on 7.5k with BTC Dominance: 45.3%.  
We seem to be in a cleaning cycle. And looking at some market caps from some alts it still has not finished...

from my friends i can confirm exactly what you are saying. the people that actually bought bitcoin in 2017, already heard about it in 2015/16 .. people need first to get a feeling to "know" about it. so yes... next time will get crazy..
@_date: 2018-07-15 05:10:18
It can actually be true. US population is 325M only 66 percent are between 15-64, that result in 17Million. Coinbase has 2/3 Us traffic on its side. (Alexa). If coinbase has 15M user now(guessed), that are 10M US Coinbase user. Another good indicator could be the traffic of coinmarketcap, anybody know about their user reach?
@_date: 2018-07-11 22:09:49
at the bottom in 2015 and 2013 bitcoin had a period where its price was not moving... for month the same price... dead... that is the point where it goes up again. so if in august we are still between 5800 and 6800 my horoscope say it will go up again. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:48:29
take a look at the recent price movements. you will see there are a lot of jumps. the last time i saw that was in beginning of 2015. for me it looks like that there are more big then small transactions. the little guys are not trading now, and people do not expect big gains from "little" people as the hype is over.  [
we will not have news of ATHs anytime soon.  miners are producing .5 billion a month. and some are waiting for bitcoin going up to sell with better gain. some people that have entered in the 10-20k rate are waiting to go out again without lost. most of the technical innovations that have been stated on 2017 are still under heavy development. ETFs will be simplified in some month, so nobody will set up one right now. so the only thing that can initiate a big jump is something like that [ . tens of billions of USD, will sky-rock bitcoin. this is the  institutional FOMO that coinbase wish to happen. and those big guys keep silent now or even drop bad news, but once they are in they start to spread positive news about bitcoin. the sad thing is that the "little" guys are not buying now, but will wait that the big once push the price to 12k first, and then will start buying at twice the price.

If you look at the tweet he said that it is based on 10k by end of 2017. in your chart it is 5k. So you need a curve that starts at 1.1.2018 or finds a formula that goes through 10k at 1.1.2018 otherwise it is not confirmed with McAfees prediction. Also, you should take the sum of the forks because he stated "the original coin".

assuming a starting price of 8k and a timeframe of 4.75 years he believes in doubling each year. (250k/8k)^(1./4.75years) = 2.06
when he bought at 600 the prediction of 10k was based on four times doubling.

I think what you mean is that a transaction is a proof of confidence between two addresses. If I get money from a lot of persons im trusty.  I could be an extortion virus, but let's forget about it. I could send the money to myself, well we can assume the value of my score is caped by the fees of the system.  What I want to say: I totally agree that the best score system is going to come on the blockchain, but so far with bitcoin some parts are missing.
