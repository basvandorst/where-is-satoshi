Well, it is the current flag of the Japanese [Navy] ( (Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force) and very similar to the current  flag of the Japanese [Army]( (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force) so read into that what you will.

Its a little confusing. I think its broken right now because when I try and go back and look at older bets they are all grayed out and just say "loading".
Edit: It works better in chrome.

That bet wouldn't give a target much time to react, but would that be a bet worth making or taking? I assume assassinating someone would involve some risk in and of itself to the assassin, and if the assassin were doing it to make it big on a predictions market wouldn't the bet have to have lots of money wagered , and would it be worth it to bet against something like this?  I ask because I still don't totally understand prediction markets.
Edit: also wouldn't that give the assassin  only a few minutes warning as well?
