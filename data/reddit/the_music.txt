That's why I always have my $200 worth of bitcoin and I'm not withdrawing. It could always go higher, and it's already worth more than the I bought.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:31:51
Thanks. Feels good. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:28
Yeah wtf. I'm so tired of relative suffering here 
"Woe is me with my millions of dollars.".
 There should be some initiative to make everybody on Reddit financially stable via Bitcoin. The amount of insanely bitcoin-rich Redditors is insane.

Why do they always make dumb mistakes like this? DPR also had an email linked to his name which he had used for a forum where he advertised SR in its early days. 
If you're gonna do illegal shit on the internet MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT HAVE YOUR FUCKING NAME ON IT

I feel that the "to the moon! Let's get rich!" Stage of Bitcoin is gone for good.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:58:08
Can confirm: bought $100 worth at $400. Now I have $300 ish.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:24:42
I did the opposite, when I saw the price go from $900 to $690 over night, I panic bought more. Got a little bummed when it continued to drop and stay &lt; $690. No matter what happens, I will not sell in a panic.
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:01:17
Cause a real ass gangsta plays his cards right.
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:06:54
It sucks always seeing Bitcoin given away sometimes. I feel like even though I'm part of this whole thing, I'm still missing out. I don't want to be a millionaire, but not having to worry about paying for college would be amazing. Shouldn't have made poor choices with my coins when they were cheap.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:14:57
Is there a watchable version up now that the stream is over?
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:47:44
It's possible. It could do a lot of things.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:39:40
So nothing to worry about essentially?
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:22:54
The second image is the blockchain page for one of the addresses which sent me the mbtc. Any reason why two random addresses sent me 0.00001btc out of the blue?

Patience. It always rises back up.
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:00:32
Last time this happened I criticized things like this.
Some kid made a few hundred bucks doing this on live TV, so I posted address in the popular thread as a similarly financially strapped college student, and was downvoted to oblivion because "you aren't being creative like the kid is." 
I still maintain that if printing your QR code and holding it is worth hundreds, my address in a popular thread should be as well.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:07:01
That's exactly how it works.

I mean, it's a pretty penny. I make $12,000 a year and if I lost my BTC I would shit a brick.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:32:53
Easy to say from your rooftop penthouse yacht m8
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:43:11
Agreed. If you spent $40,000 right now to buy 5 BTC, and the price went to $100,000 tomorrow, you'd still only have half a million.
If you wanna try the get rich shit try to guess the next crypto to go boom.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:44:53
Buy the dips, in a couple years a guy earning twice as much as you per year will say the same thing.

My [friend's] first experience with mushrooms cost $200,000.
It pains me to see old receipts where I got 10BTC at $4/btc. Oh to be 17 and stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:03:10
Just invest in BTC. Without a multi-thousand dollar set up and free electric bill it won't be worth it.

"hey Reddit give me free donations in exchange for catching our attention on the toilet for a sec."
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:59:41
Who the fuck would donate BTC to someone who's already a millionaire, and openly making terrible decisions. Send it a broke fuck like me.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:49:04
 
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:12:07
Nobody should have 90% if they HODLed properly. It's not stocks. The money I throw into BTC I assume is gone. It ain't gone til it drops 100%. Otherwise hold and wait for it to bounce back.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:18:46
Bought a quarter of a coin at 3600. I'm super happy rn because that's a lot for me.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:49:04
 
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:30:07
Lmao I wish I was that guy. I own a quarter of a bitcoin. I'd suck dick for 200 of em.

Let's pool our bitcoin, buy the mansion and rent it out and split the profits. Call it the Reddit Vacation Mansion.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:23:39
What free coin?
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:29:29
Probably. Additionally after seeing people getting rich on other cryptos, I've thrown some money into the cheaper coins and am also forgetting about them for eternity.
I'm not lucky at all, and don't have much in life. I'm determined to be posting here in 5 years as a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:11:31
Insert sob story here.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:05:11
Is there ANYWHERE to buy Cryptocurrencies anymore? People have been saying Kraken is good but all I'm hearing is that people are having issues performing even basic operations through them.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:01:44
Do they ever get to the USA?

Hell there are people who have made thousands off of Dogecoin and it's still sub $0.009.

How exactly does one obtain a paper/coldstorage bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:54:14
I'm 19. My FUTURE will be interesting at that point.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:58:39
Know that feel. I used bitcoin to buy unmentionables on TOR, not realizing their potential. One day I saw the articles that price hit $100, and I saw that I'd made $123 and cashed out. Missed the boat.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:37:03
My first time order better go through. Ima be so sad if it doesn't. YOU CAN DO IT COINBASE
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:20:36
Tried to transfer my 0.2 to a paper wallet in 2 $80 withdrawals. First one showed up fine in seconds, but the second one was withdrawn, and has yet to make it to my wallet.
Hope it's just slow...
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:09:30
Mhm. Sad thing is, I've been using BTC since early 2012, I just never realized it would do something like this. I had 9 BTC at one point. Then I forgot about it when I had 1.2. A year later, I see the news on reddit, and cashed out at $100/ 1 BTC thinking it could go no higher.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:11:33
If it crashes to $300 like some say it will, I'd buy in then.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:24
Decimal is fine. Just put *something* in.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:17:02
On the contrary, the dude who made the sign begged, he just did it on live TV, with paper.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:08:17
More like hire a fucking tax attourney
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:29:19
Go to bitaddress.org.
Unplug your internet. 
Hit "generate new blah blah"
Record the addresses digitally or print them, or write them down or WHATEVER.
Close window, plug in internet.
Transfer your coins into your new paper wallet.
Use a program (I use Electrum) to manage that wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:04:05
A 1/5th of a bitcoin is all. If it drops to $400 or lower, I'll go full coin. But I'm okay with what I've put in for now.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:42:31
mtgox, bitfinex, etc.

How many btc were those first two things?

90% sure the guy was being cheeky, and that he didn't intend on his Mom buying him Bitcoin via sign. That's what telephones are for.

God I'm glad I'm 19 and can start this shit now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:46:50
If you're super paranoid sure. The only reason for doing it like that is to guarantee there are no keyloggers or snapshop-viruses on the PC.
Honestly, a security-conscious computer user isn't going to have one and be unaware.

What the IRS doesn't know won't hurt them.

Pretty sure that word doesn't require an umlaut.

"No one" is a two word phrase. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:06:08
I tried this. Nobody cent me jack :(
If I had any more than 0.2 I'd send you a little.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:37:57
If someone can guess your private key, doesn't a paper wallet become kind of useless?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:44
Get in while the gettin's good!
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:04:26
True. Besides I love this phone. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:39:53
A sign is hardly an original idea.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:22:37
I remember when I bought BTC at $5 a coin so I could waste on some unmentionables found on TOR. When the $100 bubble began I saw that I had $120 where I previously had $20. I took it all out in cash, thinking it couldn't get higher. God I wish I would have seen Bitcoin for what it was back then. Stupid 17 year old me. Just threw in $100 today. Invest while I'm young.
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:02:56
N5 owner here. best choice ever. I love mine. It came with a dead pixel, but it's still amazing.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:37:54
That's really way too much trouble to go through honestly. Just generate the address, save it and truecrypt it into a hidden, password protected partition on two flashdrives, or SD cards.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:18:10
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:15:24
Yeap. We're in it for the long haul now you and me.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:55:07
Back when SR existed, there used to be a guy who'd send you USD in $100 bills for your Bitcoin. Ah the simpler times...
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:31:04
Meh. I keep hearing that people who return generally get something wrong with the next one. Besides, every display I own now has 1 dead or stuck pixel. It's almost tradition.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:03:10
Get in SOMETHING right now. Even just $100, in the event it doesn't crash.
@_date: 2013-10-06 03:12:12
I remember when all you could do with Bitcoin was buy drugs! Get off my lawn.
