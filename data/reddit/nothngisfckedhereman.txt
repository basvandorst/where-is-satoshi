First off, thanks for taking the time to share your feedback, I honestly appreciate it. No, I don't think the average Joe is going to stop what he's doing in the middle of the day, sit down and read the **two** sides of the flier. In fact there's actually **two** double-sided hands outs that I created. The second one describes exactly how to purchase BTC. I'll post that as well. Luckily for everyone I guess is the portability of the said hand outs. I'm almost positive that most average Joes will be able to transport the two pieces of paper after they leave and hopefully take them home to read at their leisure if they're so inclined. 


As far as the formatting, I earned a decent salary in a graphic design studio after college for seven years, *however* the formatting was not a priority at all for these at *this* point as my computer recently went down so I used the best option at my disposal - Pages for iOS, so please bear in mind this program would not be my first choice to design with. That being said however, if it is so awful as to be unreadable, that's certainly unacceptable and I will address it as soon as I have the time to create my own vector graphics - going down to the Apple Store tomorrow. 
Thanks again, you've been very helpful,  have a good one.

Design is hugely important no doubt, I really couldn't agree with you more. I should have waited to at least have the ability to use text boxes before posting my work. I posted it, you could say, prematurely because I'm most concerned with the content - all the information being accurate (if you can't read it, that definitely doesn't help though), as I'm certainly no Bitcoin expert like a lot of people on this useful sub are. 
I think this is a great and informative graphic (sorry I can't say I know who to give credit to for it), but maybe not so much for the Average Joe. I've been off these last 3 days spending my time at the most frequented coffee shop.  I talked to quite a few people and at this point I'm really surprised by the looks of utter confusion I got when I asked if they had heard of BitCoin - and from the whole spectrum of coffee shop goers. 
My own father who turns 70 next month and I would easily say with confidence that he's typically more tech-savvy than people half his age, like me. He teaches Photoshop at the community college and yet he had no idea as to what a cryptocurrency is - I really refused to believe him at first. And the coffee shop crowd, I think it's fair to say are typically more tech-savvy than say Average Joe. One barista knew exactly what I was talking about - he was literally the only one who had even 'heard' of, let alone 'knows' about BTC - which I'll readily admit I'm hardly a novice at best. 
I printed and handed out somewhat simpler fliers I made on the 13th and 14th (just basic information and how to get started - and me going over the process) to anyone who showed any interest whatsoever, but I think the more- thorough How-To's I made today seemed to inspire the more interested to hopefully follow through (but who knows - personally I think people want to know more why they should get interested in BTC to the point of feeling compelled to tell others than just how to DL a couple of apps. 
Most of you would probably put my overall knowledge of the intricacies of cryptocurrencies maybe a hair above Average Joe. Which is why I posted these on here (with awful formatting and all) tonight - to hopefully gain a little more knowledge and to develop the best means of spreading it. 
Like I said, I love the simplicity and elegance of this graphic, but if you were to put it in front of my homeboy Average Joe - he wouldn't know what the fuck he's looking at.

Definitely heard. All I can do aside from making empty excuses - is sincerely apologize wholeheartedly, learn from my mistakes, and make sure to never repeat them. 
And thank for taking the time to provide your feedback, I really do appreciate it.
