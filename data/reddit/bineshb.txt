I am in the same boat. The media has potrayed bitcoin in bad light. Moreover RBI's guidelines are not encouraging.

I am in similar boat as you . But just remember this , they are heading towards the right direction . Pay coin address a lot of bitcoin's shortcomings. They even partnered with Visa for debit cards. I cannot say that Paycoin will be always 20 USD always, but they will keep trying.

We need to get the youth involved in this . College grads . They are tech savvy and we need to create educational videos regional languages . 
Bitcoin can do wonders for remittances , but liquidity is a problem in India.

Wrong . Everyone got their coins. All these issues still happen with other exchanges.
