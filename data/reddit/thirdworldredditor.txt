There's no gains to be made from speculating with cryptos since december, so, newcomers are not getting in.
I think this is actually good because it was getting out of hand. 
Anyway, I think this is just the calm before the storm. It will pick up again sometime.

Yeah, I used to consolidate my funds on weekends very fast and almost free (10sat/b).
This hasn't been the case for a long time, however mempool seems to be on its lowest point in at least 30 days.

Did a big player enable segwit? I'm seeing many blocks above 1.1MB today

I'd say that it will be nice to have the option to store your coffee purchase for the rest of eternity IF you're willing to pay the associated fee.
If you don't give a fack about showing the world your coffee purchase then use the damn LN and stop complaining about high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:19:00
I have no idea. I only use them to monitor the mempool status. As for segwit, I have a trezor so I'm afraid I can't help you with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:29
Thanks. Makes more sense.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:32:23
No wizardry needed. Check [this]( to monitor the mempool status and estimate your fees.

Ok, so after watching both videos, it's clear to me that this will be a great way of making micropayments, however I have a question.
Let's say I go to Starblocks to get a blockachinno for the first time. 
If I understand correctly, I would have to open a channel with them and commit funds to it. So if I never plan to go again to the store I would only commit the amount necessary for 1 coffee.
So, the channel would open and close for this single transaction and the settlement on the chain would pay the actual BTC fees. 
I would actually be paying more by using LN than just sending an on-chain transaction. Am I right or is my understanding flawed?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:25:11
I get it, it's not a one-to-one channel but a mesh of interconnected nodes. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:38:24
Yeah, I'm sure they don't know you are checking it over your browser...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:28
They said they would add support. They still haven't.

None that matches coin diversity and convenience.
I've been mining for about 4 months and ironically switched to Nicehash 5 days ago because it was more convenient and maybe even more profitable. I lost 5 days of electricity today...
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:20:28
Well, they added the bcash donation link after BTC fees skyrocketed. It's a valid reason.
And actually the link you posted is recommending a fee above 600 satoshis for a transaction which is way above necessary at current mempool status.

Sarcasm? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:22:08
I agree, that's why I posted the screenshot of the mempool. 
I've only had issues with high fees during the "political crises" of BTC. Otherwise fees are very very affordable.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:24:59
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:23:02
With the added value that BTC goes up in value over time. There's no Swiss bank that will pay you even close to what BTC offers.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:24:32
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:13:20
I have one transaction there. I was waiting for the mempool to clear to send money to my Trezor.
At least my transaction is organic, many people could have been waiting like me.

Good luck making business with the Venezuelan government...

Take into account that this was done by Chavez in 2008. The new coin was named Bolivar Fuerte \(Strong Bolivar\).
It only lived for 10 years. Now they are doing it again while inflation is expected to be over 10,000&amp; on 2018 \(It was 4,000 on 2017^(\)).
The new Bolivar Soberano will live a very short life...

By buying petro you are fueling a totalitarian regime with no regards for the venezuelan people. The petro earnings will only be used to fuel corruption among government officials.
Please do not support the petro.
Us venezuelans will appreciate it.

Elections where opposition candidates cannot participate and people get threatened to vote for the government party are not democratic elections. Please get out of your socialist bubble and go see for yourself.

The conversion rate of 1 USD = 10 VEF is the one set by the goverment years ago. This rate is not to be found anywhere.
There's a huge currency black market. The Current rate is 30K VEF/USD, so that would make a bitcoin worth over 130,000,000 VEF.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:04:52
1 BTC is between [80 million]( and [120 million]( Venezuelan Bolivares.
I'm not sure where you or the app are getting your rates but they're clearly off.

They did seize antminers because they were deemed illegal, however you can find pro government people tweeting and bragging about their farms. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:05:45
I'm not an expert but I think you can. Problem is creating transactions in BTG that could be replayed on the BTC chain.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:58:19
Makes sense. Alts are going up in price while BTC is going down.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:28:59
In theory, yes. In practice, no.
It's the main reason of the economic collapse of Venezuela and the major source of official corruption.
For reference, check the price of an [iPhone 8]( It's 30,000,000 VEF. At the official exchange rate that phone would cost US$3,000,000.
At black market rates, however it's closer to it's real price at US$1,000.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:55:11
There's no way Maduro &amp; Co. are just going to give up their control over the exchange rate and USD like that.
Currency exchange is a very important factor in keeping power and filling their pockets. The enormous differential between the official exchange rate and the black market rate (x3000) allows them so much headroom for stealing that is naive to think they'll let it go.
In fact, persecution of miners and BTC traders is a very clear sign that they don't want to lose control.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:37:23
It may not be illegal but the goverment has [imprisoned]( at least 8 people for mining and/or selling mining equipment.
It is considered illegal because it allows venezuelans to skip the currency exchange control in place.
