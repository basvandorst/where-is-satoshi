There is no way bitcoin can reach 100 times more. Its already 10k. Maybe it can reach 100k in 5years or 10years.. what you think?

Good job.. I wish I wasnt afraid to send documents and passport and photos and bank accounts to "verify" my identity all around the internet.. :|

So you say when almost all bitcoin will be mined it will become worthless?

There is one horror scenario where those billionairs would start buying ALL bitcoins.. and keep for themselves.. I mean theay have enough money to buy all bitcoins.. thats certain.
Then they would be able to crash it.. no? And print their regular fiat paper money.. Any thoughts why this is not possible?

But how can you buy bitcoins anonymously? I mean your bank will know if you buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:02:02
Its not anonymous. Its just an ordinary sell buy give id give all stuff first.

It is helpful! I think many will understand stuff better reading this!
I neglected this bitcoin stuff because it still is hard to grasp the concept - like electricity, cant touch, no smell, cant see it yet its there. Takes time to understand even some basic stuff..

Cool, but is there a voting then? So we can atleast vote for other 2options instead of Segwit2x? How is it going to be "deployed" by popularity of some sorts?
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:06:49
So, that means all of these are good for us or just one? Also, Segwit is not existing anymore or its renamed as Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:23:46
This has to get reminded to people ALL the time in all segwit2x threads - because its important

Govs want to put taxes on it. Some countries already taxing bitcoins in some ways.. I think majority of countries already taxing mining! Thats what they want moneys from bt..
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:02:38
1. Does that mean bitcoin can have as many "forks" as possible?
2. Also its then not bitcoin because its not connected to blockchain?
3. So its a separate currency?
Im a noob I hope you answer :)
