Satoshi couldn’t have found a better incentive for a bitcoin.

Epic 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:36:32
ok... thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:41:56
Same here lol...

 The point here is the price of bitcoin will now be influenced by futures market as well, before it was just investors who buy/sell.
 One will have to wait and see how the impact is going to be. 
  Let’s say a Billionaire wants to short bitcoin who knows the price may fall or if he/she wants to long the other way is possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:14:35
I don’t get what you mean by 17.25?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:51
cause fking coinbase just added BCH 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:47:25
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:59:16
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:59
and now its @ 18.5 ..good lord...what's happening?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:37
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:12
You should relax. If you are new to this-you will learn.  Common occurrence BTC will shoot back.
I say you should wait and buy at the lowest with whatever you are left with. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:01:13

Edit: nevermind I got it. It's on the Google keyboard and wait for it. It's here's ₿
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:55:02
same problem here...gotta wait GDAX tranfers are all 0 fee's , its going to take atleast 3-4 hrs. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:10:23
Well Will ledger give is the question at least gdax released a statement ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:19:00

How many tried zooming into the mirror. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:47:01
yeah..forgot to mention i started to drink as soon as i sent. I just sent made a transaction from coinbase(not gdax) transfer to ledger nano worth $28 btc and the fee was guess what $8. i still dont see that on N/W
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:28:01
yep give it couple of hours... same issue. if the transfer doesnt happen by dawn or before the split...we'll have to see if cb will remit 2x coin.
RECEIVED--0.0 BTC 
SENT-- 0.0 BTC 
BALANCE--0.0 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:46:59
it took me little over a week when i moved funds few weeks ago
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:03:58
Ledger is french...doubt they celebrate Black Friday
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:56:49
What is this?
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:58:47
Its going to take time.....since GDAX has '0' fees...mmmm its disliked by Miners you see
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:33:18
Yup!  Grud luck
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:36:43
We will see when it comes down   
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:25:33
I am in the same boat as you are in. Let’s hope something positive happens. Brought all my coins to exchange during the recent dump. Now stuck here. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:01
whats with are they anti-btc or something?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:20:37
Also hope is price holds @ ~6100
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:00:09
Hey guess what...after i did that i got the initial transact BTC....see if you can kick the transfer in although its still showing unconfirmed in my ledger N...just make sure you use the same receive address...the $8 helped.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:27:08
but after the fork if you moved BTC from a hdw wallet like ledger to coinbase will the coins be lost? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:55:53
dont think you can get much from selling semen
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:24:08
There’s nothing wrong with you. 400k+ people on this sub are zombies like you. 
We are the reason for the price of BTC today. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:56:20
yep..isnt too much got that!
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:46:49
I look at it this way..if you have €1000 in your account already and you want to preserve your savings by taking out a loan and investing that way you have the 1000(to repay the loan) in case your investment (in this case BTC) got burnt for whatever reason. That way if the price goes up you enjoy the fruit if it doesn't you have the 1000 either way you win.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:55:21
Check the # of Redditors just under a week ago i remember there were 360,000 now its 381000 and counting, what does that mean PEOPLE ARE BUYING,BUYING and BUYING. Demand goes up price hikes and so on 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:58:54
"King in the Moon"
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:50:26
So essentially hold until the dust settles and we have a way to figure how to safely make transactions without loss of coins..correct?
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:31:11
Probably because of faster transfer 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:33:22
i am transferring over to Ledger Nano S. Check in coinbase..and you will see that the transfer is pending/Confirmations 0
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:16:30
That’s cause miners shift to BCH..
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:22:10
simple question...when will this political BTC/BCH sh!t end and when will crypto's go on as usual...this is frustrating as hell.
I want to see a day when this fork crap is over and crypto's get a life
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:34:58
Did gdax let you do the transfer? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:27:41
Just HODL and you will see. Just HOLD
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:26:39
So you have 10btc
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:56:46
its not PitPanda its BitPanda
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:19:45
cool....got 3
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:52:32
Just make another transaction sending to the same address from coinbase and it will be picked up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:17:10
in layman terms...no miners will adjust the difficulty to make mining easier..that means people like you and me can mine on a small laptop and earn bitcoins...which incentivizes others as well to mine and eventually a community making the prices soar higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:01:27
May be a buy time
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:50
I say buy some at the deepest dip..see it as an advantage
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:14:45
mine 4 hrs
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:36:36
WTF is this hard fork in 3 days then?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:36:03
It kept showing 2/6 confirmations (essentially unconfirmed)some 2 hrs later and then after I woke up in the morning they were all there. Don’t panic it will get there. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:08:08
There’s going to be a limit on the Transaction amount on your credit card 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:27:47
Mine took good 4 hrs. We need that lighting change or some change to take place fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:09:35
initiated transfer myself....pending as well....the fees...thats something we shouldnt have ignored...now we sit and wait 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:28:29
Naa too late  I’ll just hang in there. If you transfer now it’ll take another 2-3 hrs for the coins to appear in my wallet. You?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:02
whats .618? Cant sleep while the dear BTC is dropping like a fly
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:27:08


just hope it doesnt go down...for everyones' sake
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:36:58
Relax bud...i am nervous as well...but what can you do if CB never initiated the transaction. Once they initiate it will be picked by the N/W and miners will do the job for us
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:01:30
I would say just hoold and if price starts to plummet slowly start selling don’t sell all may be just .3/5 or even 1. So when there is a bounce you can go back in immediately but the thing is you need to be glued to the screen. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:50:41
i concur, in fact you should look at buying coins during the dip despite selling!
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:23:02
Hey It’s still a baby bull run...
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:27:04
Relax.

��% agreeeed... not too late to HODL 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:24:45
thinkabout just one brach of BOA/Chase/Wells Fargo etc.. the price for electricity /security etc... 
If you go all out decentralized. You are saving a lot of money in the big picture

nano ledger charges 23 euros just for shipping...did you actually spend that much?
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:20:37
How many are you planning on buying? I am afraid the price will fall for which I could have bought more coins.

@_date: 2018-02-18 02:22:18
So why the fuck were everyone bitching about the high prices instead of switching to segwit. This is one reason I despise coinbase when they could have adopted segwits way ahead of time.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:05:52
What personal wallet do you use? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:00:59
No begging plz
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:54:49
Did exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:11:50
Anything after the decimal 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:51:27
Cool. 
In the future make sure you send small amounts first and keep the same address copied elsewhere upon success and use that address to transfer big ones. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:33:30
Fees low and superfast... just sent from GDAX to Nano S..transfer time and fee $0

When do you this will get resolved? personally this is a major Pain in the ASS to many noobs. imagine you have no clue whats going on and need to sell BTG ending up some how selling BTC..do you atleast get your BTC money back or is it just goooone forever?
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:38:42
i concur...had i known about BTC back then....huuuuge win
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:29:54
At the same time there are articles like this who claims BTC will be valued  
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:42:29
which is why you need to mine BTG. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:10:28
EDIT: I have a pending unconfirmed transaction. But when i try to initiate a transaction while it is pending i get this insufficient funds error.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:44:53
With all this hype, its going to be a clear target for hackers. Rule of thumb never use text/sms based authentication, always use authenticators such as Google/Authy etc. and as much alerting as possible. Same should be done with gmail/or another mailing accounts. 
Always best to have a hardware wallet again
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:28:50
It’s talking longer than usual transfer times. I roughly went through 6 transactions each averaging 1 hr. As long as you have the right send receive addresses you should be good. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:11:59
That’s the best article I read about this fork. Read on. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:11:45
Guys I have 7k what point should I enter? Help. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:29:58
so whats the ideal time to cash out??
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:32:18
I am sticking to just hanging in there and holding. Fork date around 25th October.  Upon reading massive number of articles forums etc. I’ve concluded to move BTCs to a light/hardware wallet where you control your seed. Also BTC will be BTC there will only be 21 mil no matter a million forks happen. So if you owned 21 million BTCs then you own 21 million BTCs that’s it.  
We’ll all benefit from the fork in that you will get equal amount of the forked coin if in any case that coin is worth anything. Also note from my study this so called coin has no replay protection. If you understand opt in RP, please explain here. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:45:45
if there is a transaction already in progress, you might want to wait it out. i had the same issue on electrum 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:09:02
Does that mean if I moved my BTCs NOW into Nano s I will receive my BTC equivalent BTCGs when nano supports?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:04:38
With 2x can we expect any price on that new coin.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:33:55
Mine are all on the exchange... that ok?
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:12:27
You gotta be Kidding... Mine was the same amount but bought back  Learnt the hard way now I know how strong these HODLrs are
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:06:33
Did they implement replay protection already or noot!!! Damn this is annoying 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:59:17
Just a risk... probably will not happen 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:49:30
explain.. Please
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:58
and how would you know when the "DIP" ended?? OP stay calm...you did right
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:33:59
Can you elaborate? Do you mean to say you trading BTG sold BTC as well? i know i sound stupid, but your clarification can help
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:12:32
I thought that was 25th. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:07:39
I second you 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:00:11
What’s GBTC?
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:58:26
just create as new.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:58:10
But will BTCG support a wallet like electrum. My ledger nano just got shipped. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:52:15
Beware the premined coin sits  
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:16:06
The new BTG AKA sh!t coin is trading @ 141. The website claims that Replay protection works so please do yourself a favor and SELLLLL upon availability
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:43:45
lol.. needed that laugh ..you missed pup-up as well
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:15:04
It’ll comedown to 5100 again. Don’t worry 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:36:45
likewise only took 3 days.. just got to know BTC for a week before i realized it was already too damn late
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:05:32
You think GDAX works?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:32:59
never late to the game
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:54:35
Can I transfer into my nano today(10.22.17)? I saw this post in coinbase or it is it too late? 
When will this fork occur?
The fork has already privately occurred at a point known only to the Bitcoin Gold development team. The Bitcoin Gold blockchain will be made publicly available when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches block number 491,407, which is currently estimated to occur on October 25, 2017. 
 “
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:11:23
Damn it! this is so frustrating, i bought a ledger nano S specifically for BTG because coinbase wouldn't support and transferred funds over. 
Now they support 2X and i have to transfer funds back to Coinbase to get those coins. Whats Ledger N's take on this?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:35:22
Take a deep breath!
Take the transfer address login to blockchain.info and paste it there. It will show you the recipient address.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:15:42
UPDATE: JUST WAIT FOR A TRANSACTION TO COMPLETE BEFORE YOU START ANOTHER.
It worked after the first transaction is succsssful. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:07:25
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:28:40
You should look at exchange the amount into LTC and then transact..for huge sums. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:07:21
and that includes BCH as well?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:47:52
Nope... Hang in there..you will get it
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:33:22
Never gets old. Waiting for the 50k meme
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:06:49
Any  consensus here? Why is this happening? Should i be worried that my coins show up on Seg2X?
