So if I don't have internet access...how would I get Bitcoins for my wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:46:55
I cash out my check when I get paid. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:20:01
I would pay by cash. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:48:04
Guess the entire country would collapse if they abolished money....unless they replaced it with some other form of cash.
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:49:10
understand the point, but my rebuttal is that not all places have reliable internet, even in the USA.  This post is stating that a Bitcoin is better than a Fiat since is measures a failing Fiat.  Which is odd since I have yet to see any government which to Bitcoin yet.  
Personally I am a fan of Bitcoin and the block chain tech behind it.  But post like these don't really help the cause because they are not believable. Personally I would like to see Bitcoin used as a currency but it's not looking that way in the near future. People seem to only care about it has a commodity to get rich.  
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:46:14
Looks turned off?
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:05:59
Why?? What would be the purpose?
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:00:50
So you want to regulate bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:10:19
So no answer to the question? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:59:24
Well, what your talking about is market manipulation. Which Bitcoin is already under the influence of so...yes it can be done.
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:31:25
Damn straight. Screw Bitcoin and buy dogecoin. All hail Dogecoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:15:14
Why would their be a run?  I am confused. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 18:37:39
And this is why bitcoin has a hard time with mainstream acceptance 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:27:23
I am sure his comments have nothing to do with the fact that he has a startup that requires Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:20:21
You don't need to believe me. 
Look, let's say I put in $1,000 USD today. That's about .11 BTC. How do I make money I'd that value goes down? 
In a stock, you have different opinions such has selling calls or puts to get income if a stock is bearish. Also selling short for the brave traders. 
As far as the previous crashes and dips are concerned, do you think smart investor just hold on to an investment forever? There is always a time to get out and move on. Pretending your married to an investment is typically bad thing to do.
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:51:11
Funny, I formatted my whole response and it comes back as a block of words. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:40:19
No and no.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:25:40
Strawman argument and you may want to read those again. Cuckolding is not my thing, is it yours?
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:34:37
I remember getting involved with Bitcoin back when it was around $90 per coin. I even mine a little myself.  Years later the technology really hasn't advance to make it user friendly. Exchanges get hacked or shut down take coins with them, there is no recourse for fraudulent activities or even a way to find out who is responsible.  The strength of Bitcoin is also it's weakness.  Also the coins trade like a commodity so the value fluctuates wildy making it hard to use it for currency.  Also any major company that does "take" Bitcoin, usually converts it to cash. They really don't use bitcoins. Even a Bitcoin conference had to stop taking Bitcoins. Also it's technical to use Bitcoins so it is out of reach for people who lack those skills. Compared to a simple debit or credit card, there too complicated to use.
Sorry for the rant or any misspellings, I am on my phone, waiting to see the doctor....who doesn't take Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:44:38
Complete scam. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:26:23
Nope. Actually I am getting rid of what I have left. It is doing me no good anymore. I mostly invest in stocks and options right now. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:16:23
Poor analogy.  Try again. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:50:45
Without money...... You couldn't buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:01:19
I wasn't countering . I was answering the question. Cash is better.  You ever tried buying school lunch with bitcoins? Do you know what will get your a school lunch..... Cashola. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:42:37
You have some good insights and food for thought. I will see about reading your recommendation. If you are invested into BTC or any cryptocoin that you want to support, then I say good. 
I use options because they provide leverage when you don't want to risk the capital. 
What I hate are articles that try to say an absolute on a future that no one can remotely predicted, trying to get you to mainly buy (a couple where for selling). Instead of saying "Bitcoin will be this price, here is the sound reasoning why".  
So I made a choice to sell based upon what was the right time for me. And for me, Bitcoin as in investment, will not work. No one article I read inspired me to keep in it. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:50:19
Yes, money is better. That all makes sense now. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:13:49
If I can't buy it with bitcoin, then yes.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:25:14
Right,.... So really the block chain technology is where it's at if you ask me.  I read the white paper a long time ago, not sure how is that supports your argument.  As far as online stores, are you supporting my argument that it is too technical to be used as a currency. You have to convert it to gift card to use. If I use my debit card....no conversion needed. I just use it. Also most online retailers do not take Bitcoin. Some even stopped like Steam due to....... wait for it....... volatility and fees. Hence it is not a good to use as currency. 
I am not saying it's bad, but it is still not ready for prime time and is as an investment, well it is also too risky. Unfortunately I do not see that changing anytime soon or even 5 years. It may go up or down, or a new cryptocoin may take it's place. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:32:04
Doest the fact your using a 3rd party device make the idea of bitcoin pointless?  After all a debit card would have to go through the visa/mc network and cost more fees.
And yeah, your right. Wealthy people dont go to dive bars.  I forget those places don't service the rich. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:53:27
Only if you are carrying lots of it.  I don't need protection for my gold necklace. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:12:08
You only pay taxes in profit. 
The spread depends on what you are comfortable with. 
Also you have to consider transfer fees as well.
What you are attempting to do is time the market. It can be very stressful emotionally trying to find a good in and out point. I wish you well. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:09:59
People have to use it for it to be valid.  No one really uses bitcoin.  Sure we got those on offs that claim they traded cash for all of bitcoins but people don't truly use bitcoin on a daily basis.  I cannot go to a club and whip out sheet of paper with a wallet scribbled on it and say "Drinks on me!".  But I can with a wad of cash.
It makes no sense to use bitcoin as a currency.  It's kinda like gold, only less useful.
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:25:46
And still couldn't use it to buy drinks at a the local dive bar.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:12:20
Yes and yes
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:26:31
Cause you do realize you have to have a 3rd party device to make it work.  Like a phone with internet for example.  Do you know what works by itself..... Moola, lettuce, cabbage, cheddar.  All names for cash. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:40:55
Not that much return. I was trying to actually use them at one point as currency. 
 I found that buying bitcoins to hold on to was a poor long term strategy. Bitcoins have no intrinsic value. All you can do is yell "HODL" and hope the demand out weighs supply longer than you want to hold on for it. 
Also to use past results to prove future results on a cryto with no real information on the future besides guessing and yelling "HODL" doesn't work for me. 
But that is my opinion. Take it for what it is worth.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:55:57
   Great post. Might as well down vote me now.  I was an early fan on Bitcoin and the block chain technology behind it. Still am, but as a currency, it is no good. As an investment, it is still no good.  Use it if you want to support it but please do not think it will become mainstream in 5 years or so. I don't see that happening anytime soon. 
   Remember that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. None. So the price of Bitcoin is what people are willing to pay for it. As people bought Bitcoin while the price has gone up, what do you think those people did once they realize the price was going down? They started selling. Hence the price keeps going down. 
  What I believe will happen is that you will see a stready support for Bitcoin at a lower level until the next new thing happens and it will be another great story of the internet like AOL, IRC, that guy who sold is webpage ads per pixel and so forth. Bitcoins have a lot of competition.
   Also when you bring up an argument against the current use of Bitcoin, someone always brings up the white paper and asks if you read it.  Let me help you out, read it first because it does not do anything other than confuse non technical people. The way I see it if Gramps can't understand it, than it's too complicated for the masses.
    Also will tell you that all governments fail and so on and point to a country in crisis like Venezuela (I think someone has already).  Did you see the news reports about people begging for bitcoins on the street? No? That is because they want food, water, medical is what they are begging for. Do you think cryptocoins matters to them if they have no electricity or internet?  Basically cryptocoins are a first world technology and still need a structure to work on. 
   What I do see happening is using the block chain technology to speed up wire transfers and other things.  That I am sure will be mainstream soon.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:08:27
The article did not explain why he thinks Bitcoin will go up other than single day price hikes. Another shill article.
