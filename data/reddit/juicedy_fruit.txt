I wish I had an account there just so I could close it and let them know why.

"Bitcoin is great and will replace traditional banking! Pay us to put your bitcoin into a traditional banking system!" Am I wrong or is that what's going on here?

Can we do this in every aspect of life, not just bitcoin?

Saw I post a while back - “I invested what I could afford to lose, but now it’s grown so much I can’t afford to lose it!”

this is why "taxing the rich" will never work. they have the money to spend on finding the loop holes.

The systems built over the past hundreds of years DO NOT help the people. The banks and governments are the ones who rely on them. Historically, when people realize how unfair the fiat system is, they turn to other mediums of exchange. And that is when the governments bring in legal tender laws and outlaw gold, etc. 
When the dollar collapses, they will outlaw crypto, and force the SDR on everyone. Hopefully they won't have taken all our guns by then..

Seems like a good advertising campaign. Just be sure to leave a real tip along with the trinket.

Yup. It’s safer, but only if you know what you’re doing.

With trezors on back order, I'll be storing my coins on a 'tato wallet
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:41:26
1) But what if the next time it goes down it's from $2000 to $1600? My justification for buying now is if you believe it will go to the moon, you will look back and not care that you could've waited a month and saved a couple hundred dollars. Justification for waiting is the same though, you will look back and not care that you waited a month and paid an extra couple hundred dollars. :)

You buy 1 bitcoin for $2700. Then value goes up so that 1 bitcoin is worth $27000. You now have 10x more money.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:06:20
Invest what you can afford to lose. Gains are proportional. So maybe you don't get to buy a lambo by only investing $100, but if bitcoin goes up you're still making money.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:08:25
But but.. lambos..
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:39:00
Oh I see. I guess if the value of 1 BTC becomes very high, that would mean bitcoin has a very large market cap, and therefore (probably) has mainstream use, which is a positive for the currency.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:40:54
I have electrum on an internet-connected PC. I'm not planning to spend the coins in this wallet for a long time. I put what I guess is the "wallet file" onto an encrypted thumbdrive, and I have the seed phrase written down. Should I then delete the wallet file from my computer so that it cannot be hacked/stolen?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:57:02
Hmm I don't know very much about currencies either so hopefully someone else can comment too. But I would say yes, the dollar has a high market cap because there are so many dollars in circulation. But the federal reserve can just print more dollars, while bitcoin will have a fixed amount. This goes back to the value of bitcoin for trading purposes; it is deflationary.

I like this video which says basically the same thing.
