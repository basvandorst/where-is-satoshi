Then don't use price as an argument

Monero had flexible block size, so it will never get a mempool like btc currently has (which is driving up fees)
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:59:04
Maybe so but there's plenty of server rooms in the infrastructure around bitcoin as well. It is ludicrous to suggest that bitcoin is efficient compared to a bank wire transfer.

Do you only care about the gains? If people are only in bitcoin for the gains then it is flawed
Disclosure: I'm in both bitcoin and general crypto. Diversify, spread risk, profit.

Haahaaaa, what a fucking tool
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:57:16
Signed up but don't see how to receive the bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:22:24
It never asked me for it
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:06:39
I think this one is the best, rolls off the tongue nicely and it's clear what it is.

Poloniex? Buy some maidsafecoin.

Just because they aren't successful yet doesn't mean they won't be

Just like MySpace...

Insider trading? ETF approval?

Not if you're rounding to the nearest square number

Or he is the original hodler. When bitcoin replaces fiat he will be able to buy the world.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:04:09
Bitcoins not a company
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:29:08
It's not fiat either. 
I think the only thing that could drive btc to zero, is someone fucking a huge flaw in the code. If this happened someone would fork/snapshot the network and create a new currency such fixes the flaw. You'd probably take a big hit on your net worth but I don't think it'd go to 0. 
The only thing that might would be apocalypse style scenarios where we lose the internet, but then I don't think dollars would be very valuable either...

That guy was wrong. I don't know the answer to your original question but more inputs does mean higher transaction cost.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:50:02
I don't want to FUD (it's not in my interests, quite the opposite) I just want to be realistic. As far as utilities and miners go, it's a simple financial issue.  You can't rely on them to decide how much is too much. It already is too much! Bitcoin uses more electricity than some countries!
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:10:52
Someone's already doing this with the large bitcoin collider 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:59:37
Your solution is that we
pay higher transaction fees? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:20:45
Last time I checked you needed to 'host' your own listings, and you couldn't run it through tor so you could be tracked down. Both of these things were going to change though so keep an eye on it
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:25:04
Surely you'd need a stupendously prevalent bot to have any chance of matching pools? ASICs are about 1000x as powerful as GPUs, which are 1000x as powerful as CPUs, so doesn't this mean 10000s-1000000s of computers infected just to equal one ASIC?

Or retire to Barbados or Vietnam or a cheaper country. Live on £1000 a month comfortably sipping tequila sunrises
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:44:24
But it is. The price of everything reflects the fees retailers pay visa
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:26:36
You may not pay directly pay fees but there is a fee paid for every transaction you make.
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:59:37
It's not, so why are you saying bitcoins worse than visa coz of fees?
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:19:30
Most workplaces would (or should) destroy the hard drives
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:44:40
You're fees are too high (unless you've got an obscene amount of inputs to all your transactions). Debit card transactions cost around 10-20p a pop
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:36:14
I'm almost at that point. I'm selling a motorbike, I'm tempted to drop the price a fair bit just to make sure I have money in my account if we dip hard...

There's a lot of FUD on DNMs that AB (the largest DNM) are exit scamming
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:52:30
Check out There's a couple of posts on the front page right now. I don't know if it's true, if I was exit scamming I'd probably go all out rather than the trickle of lost withdrawals it seems to be. Might just be tech difficulties, blockchain congestion, competitors FUDding
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:40:52
Use Monero bud. Or push for byteball, total scalability and allows for completely private transactions
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:38:41
I did but got convinced otherwise from the comments.
I'm a bit of a shit OP (fire and forget on my topics like nobodies business)
