Bitcoin has some good attributes for a world reserve currency--decentralized, not owned by a single country/government, independent of the dollar / fiat, deflationary. 
however, it is still too volatile to actually be considered a world reserve currency.  I would expect a future stable coin to be the international reserve currency.  I think the Dai (built on ethereum) has the best chance at doing this, personally.

A reserve currency is held in large quantities by governments and institutions as part of their "reserves".   
Basically if shit goes sour for their country and their local currency gets wrecked, the reserve currency is a universally agreed upon currency that is commonly used in international transactions and is considered to be a safe-haven currency.  It is their 'back up' money that they hold.
Right now it is the US Dollar, but governments often hold yuan, euros, etc. too.

If I were a real estate agent, I'd try my best to make it happen.  The press would be great for you, imagine "Beverly Hills House Purchased in Bitcoin", and also knowing that you facilitated a BTC purchase of a house can help attract other crypto-&gt;real estate buyers to your business.

This site is pretty good for tax related stuff:
Here is an excerpt that is relevant to your situation:
"What happens if I earned Bitcoins?
Most countries will also consider earning of crypto-currencies as a barter transaction or payment-in-kind. You are taxed as if you had been given the equivalent amount of your country's own currency. So, for example, say your salary was paid in part cash and part Bitcoin, and each month you received $1000 worth of Bitcoins, you are taxed like you had just received $1000. If you are paid wholly in Bitcoins, say 5 BTC, then you would use the fair value. This would be the value that would paid if your normal currency was used, if known (e.g. $1000), otherwise you would use the price of Bitcoin at the time to establish your taxable income."
TLDR: You pay taxes on the value of the bitcoin on the day it was received.  It doesn't matter if you sold it or not, it is considered income.  If you sell it for USD I believe you will have to pay an additional capital gains tax on that.  
I am not a tax accountant.

Rather than predicting it, I would say F.A. Hayek's writings helped shape / inspired the invention of bitcoin

It would be cool if we made May 18 'Pizza Day' to celebrate this event, and everyone buys pizza's with Bitcoin every year on this date.

The US economy will have a big crash (2008 like) among the election of the new President.  This economic crash will cause the Bitcoin price to skyrocket.
This coupled with: halving, etf approval, and any other events that come along the way.
