There is such a thing as a conspiracy.  It is when a group of people work together to further their interests against the interests of others. 
Simply accusing someone of believing in a conspiracy is not a reasonable insult, nor does it provide any argument against their views. Unless you are trying to suggest no group of humans has ever conspired against another, in which case you are an idiot.

Just start googling related terms and reading all u can find about bitcoin and how it works. When u come across words u dont know, look em up and do your best to understand.
Also, sure buy $20 so u can see how the process works and get in the habit of checking the price...once in awhile... 
Anyway, this is what worked for me, after about a week i started to understand the basics of what a bitcoin is and the potential it has :)
