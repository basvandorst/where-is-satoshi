We need something to track visitors. IP anon is turned on (getClicky feature). But I'm open for any suggestion that respect more user privacy. Any idea?

I just fixed a small bug maybe you was affected. Email me the file uid if it's important.

Accepting bitcoin is not just a simple business decision. It's much more. It's a vote for free economy and free world.

You have right. Bitcoin is the bottle neck. But we decided to help &amp; promote Bitcoin instead of giving other payment methods. Promoting Bitcoin is our main mission.

New feature: The secret encryption key is stored in the URL now. Not even us are able to decrypt your files without the key.

Did you share the file link or the transaction link? Every transaction has a unique bitcoin address so you have to share the file link (coinuploads.com/downloads/unique_fileid) and your friend should click on the download button.
Thanx for the feedback we should make this obvious on the page.

jesset77 Very smart thoughts. You are such a party popper :))) We are working on this already!
The main benefit of the secret keys inside the URL: we, the server owner's can't access the file. Even if we forced to do so.

It's too expensive for this kind of service.
