Your absolutely right. These hodl, moon, lambo kids should atleast speculate on bitcoin by spending and replenishing it instead of just holding in the hope that someone stupider buys their coins for 1000000

Since the article suggests that the bitcoin can only be used via a bithumb hot wallet this is the total opposite of decentralization. On the other hand will this also definetely increase the real world usage of bitcoin and therefore be good for all other users in terms of price stability and liquidity.

Considering the definition of socialism "workers owning the means of production" countries like Norway are definetely more socialist than Venezuela.

Bank fires two employees that were involved in private trades with a mafiosi.
Same bank bans crypto purchases via credit card.
Sorry but I see nothing wrong with that(except you are a scammer or stupid enough to buy your crypto with credit card).

They are against the mafia(two employees involved in private trades with a mafioso fired) and against bitcoin credit card purchases(often used to scam sellers). 
I see nothing wrong with that.
