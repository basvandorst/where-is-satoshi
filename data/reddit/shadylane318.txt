How do you know your computer doesn’t have a keylogger? Don’t be stupid. Play it safe and write the words down or get something like cryptosteel

Sure. What’s your address?

Yea, after doing some research I'm going to hold off for the ledger blue.

Whoa. Did I just receive my first bitcoin? I'm so grateful and confused at the same time. How did you find my bitcoin address, Sammrr?

Thank you good sir! I will def pay it forward.

Quick Update: I went into a backup that I had and I just replaced all the files with the backup and it worked! I'm back up and running again! Thanks for the tips guys!

What's the lesson here? 
People say use paper wallets?
Don't keep that type of amount in an online wallet?
2FA for all accounts related to bitcoin (email, coinbase, etc)
Blockchain is still hackable with all security measures in place (explain this to me please)
Don't use android or windows.
Did I get this right?

Hey guys,
I'm currently going through some issues with my Bitcoin-QT Client. I recently upgraded to Mavericks on my Mac and now the Client is refusing to update or even open! I have made multiple backups of my walllet and I'm trying to figure out the best way to get my bitcoins back...

Could you mine for me?
Thanks!
