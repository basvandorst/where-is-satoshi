This also could be used as sound predictive analysis of the coming financial quarter too.

Actually I tend to mostly up vote this whether it's this one or the down hill.

I've only ever hodl with BTC. It's easier and typically more affordable to use ETH or a market coin to convert into other coins or use as a stablecoin.

Fees suck but also remember that Segwit addresses help make transactions faster and overall are healthier for the network.

The Vatican actually owns a pretty good amount of crypto and have their own blockchain implementations to help with some of their agendas.

Coin mining only will benefit from green acts due to it forcing mining off grid earlier to self sustained solar, wind, and hydro.

TL:DR - Don't let fomo trick you into even making causal investments unless you seriously have money to gamble with. Enjoy your holds, try to catch the next serious dip. This is a pump like 2017.
If you don't watch this every waking day like some do (because its literally their business model) there are easy ways to stay out of trouble.
If you are noticing crypto for the first time or again, congrats on noticing a pump while bitcoin appears to be testing against 8k pressure.  Noticing what looks like fomo or a bull run is not a time to buy casually. Maybe if you don't have any sort of wallet (cloud, hard, etc.), this would be a great time to read the community wikis and find where questions have been answered so you at least set one up.
If you already have crypto and have meant to hodl instead of feeling regret missing a previous time to sell thank you for continuing to passively help promote digital currency against traditional nation-state controlled fiat and industry controlled debt. You should spend this time maybe doing more reading, enjoying a few good community memes or get a chuckle from someone wearing a tinfoil hat in here (maybe their prediction will come true). If you have some fiat (nothing more than 1-2% of your total retirement across all your investments across all markets) maybe is that perfect time to plan what crypto to research and decide to casually watch for the next best dip to buy into.

Buy low, always hodl.
