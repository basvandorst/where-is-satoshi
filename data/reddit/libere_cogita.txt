You can purchase with cash from an ATM at IBAY Computers in Port Moody (2929 Saint Johns Street).  It was placed there by Cryptopick Canada.  Not sure what the premium is.

I ordered one and am waiting as well.  I emailed them in mid-April and got a response that they got 800 of the 1000 and as soon as the final 200 arrive they will be shipping them out.

As a lender i see none of the borrower's information. I can see if they've attached their FB, Coinbase, LinkedIn, or other accounts as verification, but nothing more.  I've not taken a loan, only funded them, so unsure of whats required from a borrower's perspective.

If my concern was that a particular fiat currency was going to "crash" I wouldn't wait... and while i was divesting myself of that particular currency, I'd be converting some of it into long lasting necessities and bartering items as well.

i had to go into the router administrator account and forward port 8333.  between instructions for the router and a few how to bitcoin sites, i figured it out.

My experience over the past year has been different.
For example, Simon Fraser University has added a Bitcoin ATM to their bookstore, and several new ATMs have cropped up around other parts of Vancouver.  At Waves Coffee House locations there are several 2 way ATMs, so not just 1 way.  Within 5 minutes of me, there is an ATM where I have purchased on numerous occasions with cash and no identification required.

here is a 25 minute chat that should give you a bit of bitcoin flavor.

Vancouver area has a lot of btc ATM's.... not less than three within a 5 minute drive for me.  Easy as scan your qr code, insert fiat, receive btc.

What do you see as the next wave of potential bitcoin business opportunities?  How would you advise someone who doesn't write code to build such a business? What would be the FIRST skill set such a person should develop to improve success?

If you happen to be in the Vancouver area, there are several ATM locations, which from my perspective is the best/safest approach to purchasing bitcoin.  No need to provide any kind of identification... just walk up, scan your QR code, insert $C, and press purchase.  Done.

I have used two different ones in the greater Vancouver area.  They are there and working.

Perhaps the word "issuance" in place of emission?  Also it is "gold standard" in place of "golden standard". 
Consider "...by speculation of value relative to fiat currency..." (which dollar... US dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar?)

Pointing out potential flaws in a system is a useful exercise...  it's often an important step in the improvement process.  Unfortunately it can also be abused and is frequently used to destroy rather than improve.  I wonder at the ultimate intent of these anti-Factom polemics...

i have an account with bitbond and made my first loan today. 6week repayment period.  guess we'll find out how it goes...

So negative comments are altruistic, but positive comments are probably motivated by self centered greed?
Our friend, Mr. Jimmy Song, has invested a great amount of time and effort and energy in this tiny little corner of the universe.  It is neither pro-Factom or anti-Factom to question his fixation.

Mycelium.

Though i don't use BTC-e and i don't know this poster, my first inclination is to ask "what is their agenda?"  It seems short on facts, long on innuendo.
@_date: 2015-09-13 04:54:05
check your unit of measure.  some default to mBTC (which is what it appears you have).

I use mycelium as my only wallet.  They are incredibly responsive, both to email and comments in this forum (which adds to my comfort level).  There is a threshold point at which I will move some to cold storage, just haven't gotten there yet.  :-)

In the permission details section I see a larger list of items, but upon checking the app on my phone, the only permissions are "camera" and "your location".  Looks like a documentation error and not an actual control/access problem.
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:51:51
I use Mycelium.  Never had any problems and gotten questions answered quickly with them.  In my book, they rock.
 
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:38:12
Thanks Miracle Max....
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:50:43
I use Mycelium.  It has a wonderful user interface, it easy and intuitive to use and also supports paper wallets and trezor if you want additional cold storage options.
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:00:50
Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:49:00
Thank you for the incredible level of engagement that you and others at Mycelium demonstrate. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 03:30:22
Follow up... I submitted a request to help explain the problem and a way to resolve it.  They closed the ticket as resolved, though all I got was a cut and paste of the same message that appears on my account page.
This is not the kind of service I was hoping for...
