Man, TRON was the biggest pump and dump i've personally seen yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:55:47
How is this getting so many upvotes? This is PURE speculation and an exaggerated one at that.

Only cars I have heard of being sold for bitcoin are supercars. The CTS is pretty widely available, you'd probably have a bit of trouble trying to find a buyer willing to pay in btc.

Is anybody really surprised though? I don't think anybody really expected another meteoric rise without a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:24
Right? The person took the time to comment, why not take the time to go to youtube and find one of the thousands of videos that will break it down at the very least.

A. If it's crazily over-priced why are you buying more if you think it'll go down? 
B. Isn't it pretty stupid to tell the world exactly how much bitcoin/money you have in bitcoin?

The EUR and USD are two different currencies.

There's nothing you could have done differently. The price could have just have easily gone to $18k right after. HODL and stay strong.

So *IF* this is a pump and dump, how will we know when the dump is happening?

Yes I was looking to hold until 400 and then sell right at 400, and then sell if it dropped to 345. Is there a way to do that on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:15:17
Can someone explain this to me please:
This morning on the gdax order form under the STOP tab I hit sell and I put the amount as the number of LTC I had at the time with a stop price of 400 and a limit of 345. A bit later I found out it "settled" for a price of 358 and sold my LTC at that price. Not mad about it, but what I thought would happen is the order wouldn't be executed until LTC hit 400. What am I not understanding?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:21
What we are seeing is historic. Have there ever been any stocks that have done anything like this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:05:52
Ok, so back to the whole why buy right now if you think it's crazy over-priced? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:12:25

Why is coinbase nearly always behind Gdax? Aren't they pretty much directly connected? Coinbase is the only way to get direct money into gdax instantly and it's super annoying they aren't at least within $50 of each other, for me it's normally at least $100 difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:44:09
Can someone explain why gdax is "post only" mode right now with BCH? Say you wanted to buy $100 worth of BCH, how would you do that currently?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:23:21
Thats a good ELI5 thanks!

Yes? Why else did you message a girl whom it looks like you've never messaged, saying "I need you in my life in literally any kinda way"? That's either blatantly asking for sex or a super cringey and pathetic attempt to hit on a girl. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:54:58
I could care less, just thought it was funny. It's the kind of pick up line would use on some random chick. It's not even really a pick up line, more like begging for attention.

"I need you in my life in literally any kinda way" and the following "Venmo me 200 i'll fuck you 2 hours" is what I was referencing. I get your cute little bitcoin is a real currency circlejerk joke.

@_date: 2019-03-07 14:27:56
Yea it's the whales! It's definitely not the fact that bitcoin has drastically dropped out of the public spotlight and normal people have got it and got out already. Definitely not because the majority of humans see bitcoin as hard to get in or shady. Nah definitely not. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:07:41

Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:36
I worded my question to simply. What if you had 500 total investment but bought at different price points?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:03
Is there a calculator out there to figure out what your amout of bitcoin would be worth if it went to x price. Say one invests $500 at 10,000 $/BTC how would you figure out what your $500 investment would worth at say 50,000 $/BTC?
Edit: i'm an idiot I get it haha. Thanks to those who broke it down though.

Can I upload videos on bitcoin and blockchain? /s
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:42:48
Yes, bought bitcoin when it was worth ~$8,000 USD. If you want the full story; I got in at around $1,500 USD then sold when it hit $18,000 because I got scared and had some awesome gains. Then when everything seemed to even out for a few days I got back in at around $8,000 and have watched the money wither away ever since. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:01:39
What you see as complaining, I see as being realistic. I don't have enough clout, nor friends, nor anything else to keep people from buying bitcoin because nobody will listen to what I say. I'm just stating what I believe and the attitudes towards bitcoin i've read here and a few other places on the internet. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:33:01
I get that people love bitcoin, but I think we have to be realistic. I doubt we’ll ever see $10k again. The hype is gone, the vast majority of people don’t care about bitcoin again because they hopped onto the train a few years ago before $10k, then when the bottom fell out they all decided bitcoin isn’t a good investment and have moved on. The only people still investing in bitcoin are people who truly believe in the tech and whales. The time of “riding the Lamborghini to the moon” has come and gone and likely we won’t see it again. The trust that many people had in bitcoin for a short time is gone due to the massive fall in price. Normies will continue to avoid bitcoin because of what it is; a bad investment. The only reason I’m personally still in is because I bought at like $8k so I’m stuck unless I want to take a loss, which more and more is looking like the right thing to do.
@_date: 2019-04-07 01:10:49
That's not what I was trying to say, i'm very happy with how I made out. I just don't have a lot of hope to recoup what i've put back in.

When you got in at $800, this is the only perspective you should have.
When you got in at $10,000+ you don't feel this way.

You've got half a page of history, most of which it looks like you've tried and failed to delete, I wouldn't call that deep creeping. There's a lot of recent crypto experts on this sub now it seems, enlighten me with your ~2 weeks of crypto experience. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:49:34
That happened??
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:25:59
I'm sure it will. Meanwhile, thousands of other "normies" lost thousands maybe millions during the meteoric rise, good public opinion was lost. The only people that have this attitude are people like us who got in WAY earlier than everyone else. While we celebrate because yes technically we are up monumentally since we got in, most people got in too late and got out too late. And i'm still cynical because sure i've made money but at this point I don't expect anything spectacular.
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:47:13
Well to get on the hood of a main team you’re gonna need to have minimum $600k for one race. Dogecoin was able to get on Josh Wises car for cheap because they were a back marker team who never finished on the lead lap, so it was much cheaper to get on the car. Kasey Kahne has been sponsored by xrp I believe a yea or two back for a couple of his dirt races

That's not at all what I said. Where did I even say we should ban bitcoin? I was just pointing out that bitcoin is used by many people for many things, including drug dealing and (I have no proof) i've got a haunch that if the Sinaloa Cartel is smart, they probably use it as well. I think it's ignorant to think that they or others don't use bitcoin to launder money since it's all anonymous. Of course banks launder money, that's been a thing since long before bitcoin was around.

Looking at an entire year is cherry picking? I've been watching bitcoin since 2014. Everyone's argument is always "bitcoin is up x,xxx% since it started it's still up" and while yes that is a true statement, it's not true for everyones portfolio. I've noticed the only people who use this argument are people who have been involved for a long time. My opinion, is that the majority of the public has lost faith in bitcoin due to what happened in the end of 2017 and all of 2018, when it became "mainstream". Now we are in a position where bitcoin has faded again into a niche currency that a vast majority of the population who got involved in the timeframe I just mentioned lost money on because they didn't get in early enough. They saw how it inflated and then popped. Leading me to infer that yes, bitcoin is a great technology but won't really gain much mainstream attention again.

Yes, but bitcoin was the primary way of paying. So you can't say it wasn't used by drug dealers. I'm sure you're aware of the quantities that people ended up getting busted with; it was substantial. If you think the Sinaloa Cartel doesn't use bitcoin as well, then I think you're being willfully ignorant.
