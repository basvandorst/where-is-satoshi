In that case, I am sorry for your temporary loss.

It's interesting how Bitcoin seems to come up organically in my Masters level distributed systems course. A friend of my is actually doing a thesis on blockchain theory and potential applications outside of of cryptocurrency.

My friend felt bad about buying at $15k, I told him it won't even matter in a month.

Everyone uses the term wrong. Glitches originated from electronic hardware design. Essentially something is wrong with the physical connections, either they were designed incorrectly, or manufactured incorrectly. When a programmer messes something up, it's called a bug.
i.e. A computer can have a glitch, but a program can only have a bug.

A Moving Average is essentially just taking the average of the past *n* days. Its typically very arbitrary, but is a good indicator of the health of a market. If I use a 50-day Moving Average on the price of Bitcoin, you will notice the price rarely ever dips below that. Most investors use a 200-day Moving Average for more stable markets.
Personally, I would recommend a 30-day Moving Average for your business. During the last dip to $5500, the 30-day MA was $6250, but during the ATH of $7800, the MA was $6200. Essentially, it is allowing you to purchase Bitcoin by dollar cost averaging over 30 days.
The only customers that would pay more than the price of Bitcoin would be during the 1-week dips we have every 2 months, otherwise, they'd be getting a deal and you might not have to give the 5% discount.

Gemini in the US works great for me. They are regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) and claim to be held to the highest level of capital reserve requirements and banking compliance standards.
Honestly, I don't feel worried about leaving my Bitcoin in the exchange. I can trust other brokers to hold on to $50k, there shouldn't be a reason I can't trust Gemini to hold on to $10k.
I could be very naive on this though, so I welcome any advice to the contrary.

It purports itself as the true Bitcoin, and it makes it harder to new users to understand the madness. A Bitcoin to the layman should be a Bitcoin.
Once I found out about different types of coins, I put far too much time into ensuring when I bought Bitcoin, I was buying it, and not some altcoin. I know now the ticker is BTC vs BTH, but it still took me a bit to ensure I wasn't screwing myself over by making an uniformed decision.
It is dangerous for forks of Bitcoin to refer to themselves as Bitcoin. Changes to Bitcoin should be made with unanimous consent, not through forks that split the market.

Oh I'm only talking about 8% of my wealth being in Bitcoin. Its a big risk, but I'm young. Nothing to worry about if I lose it all because it will be made back within a year by my other investments. I'm certainly not losing any sleep over it, but I am learning a lot of lessons.

What exchange are you using? I'm pissed at Gemini and need to switch.

They definitely are still filling, I just got a script set up today with Gemini's API and I can see all transactions coming through.
UPDATE (4:25pm EST): Heartbeat lost from Gemini, Handshake returns Error 503

I'm in it for the long term. I want to avoid those 25% Short-term Capital Gains taxes.

Yah, we spend $26k a year between my wife and I but make $50k (after taxes), and we feel very comfortable. However, I always get looks from my friends when I say, "Oh we don't have the money allocated for that new laptop right now." Although we feel very comfortable, we also feel significant pressure to "Keep up with the Jones" and buy that new fancy item.

By paper wallet, do you mean write down the seed for my private key and store it in a safe?

They are just regular income taxes. If you are married and make less that $75k, you are getting screwed by paying long term cap gains at 15% instead of income tax at 10%.

Gemini allows up to $500 to be pre-credited per day, and up to $15000 a month. No fees charged.
My advice is to wire a large amount (&gt;$5k), and buy dips each day with the $500 daily pre-credit.

Have you considered charging a moving average of bitcoin? Reduces volatility and your risk, and the people who want to use their coins to buy probably bought them a while ago, so it's still a deal for them.
Of course, I could be totally wrong with my assumptions. I just want to hear your take on it.

Looking to switch to a different exchange that didn't crash. Any recommendations?

This hits too close to home :( If it weren't for my emotions I would have profits right now. All my limits have been profitable, all my impulse buys have bit me in the ass.

There are a lot of people trying to act against Bitcoin, and it is difficult to differentiate between sincere criticism and brigading/trolling.
I was temporarily banned a couple days ago for commenting on a deleted post. The mods thought I was brigading because the only way to get to the post was through another post pointing out it had been deleted. Technically they were right, but I wasn't trying to do anything malicious, so I messaged them and explained the situation. My ban was quickly rescinded.
Moderating is a difficult task and it's easy to make mistakes based on a quick judgement call. There are so many reports every day and you try to go through your modqueue as quickly as possible, but it can be impossible to know for sure if someone is acting maliciously. It's a big issue with social media across the board, and a reason why "shilling" has been so effective lately.

This is the attitude to have. It will go up. I just feel sorry for those who don't have the extra cash to buy when it goes down right now.
I'm sitting at a cost basis of $7155, I bought a substantial amount at $7800. Oh well.

How do people feel about buying from Gemini in the US? I put in my financial information today and they seem like a normal financial institution.

No, no, it's called the inDICKator.
