Yes. The transaction that is stuck is not a public Bitcoin broadcast transaction, its a transaction in a database on a mtgox server (or something they are trying to cover up etc)

Thanks for this man. I dropped the following into retailers.json to see how much localbitcoins sellers are making % :)
    {
            "name": "localbitcoins.com",
            "hosts": ["*.localbitcoins.com"],
            "rate": "coinbase",
            "selectors": [
                "[class=\"column-price\"]"
            ]
    }

You should set up a website and take requests or something, because you have some skills my friend.

If the networks slows down the difficulty drops and the network speeds back up again.

I love the fact that I can control who broadcasts and captures a QR code, this is much harder with Bluetooth or NFC.

Do you have some setup where you trade your drawing ability for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:41:39
Edit3: and make it work on mobile.

How terrible do you need to be though, to lose money gaming an exchange that you coded?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:39:08
Qr coded pillows, go!

Why the fuck would anyone want Litecoin for their Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:21:11
They could do that but really don't have to, provided they are still making profit off spread.
I think they just suck :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:57:28
I was just about to write 'ditch them and go with a local bank'!
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:34:54
How is this bad news? All they have done is shit on the Bitcoin protocol for weeks, and I can't think of any good they have done.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:18:03
Its not that sensitive, I just subscribe to 'deny all'.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:36:43
So was it you or him that declared bankruptcy?
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:11:36
Its almost like they asked him in the past to sort his shit out and he did not.

I'd love to see bitleak.com right about now

Hit download zip, then run the HTML file (while offline to be safe).

I'll happily send someone a 20gb .z7 file for thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:50:45
Has there been any payments to that address?
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:58:27
Would you be interested in selling them?
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:59:19
They should start taking micropayments and giving me content I want and can easily pay for directly instead of trying to sell me shit and ruining the internet with fucking 'OBAMA DOESNT WANT YOU TO KNOW'.

I mean to say 'possible to use offline' vs 'online by nature' (bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:05:03
I think the only reason they don't like NFC is because it doesn't run through their server?
Its a handy protocol to have and I use it often.
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:50:03
To think people fucking want e-ink and capacitive touch for this price.

My favorite part was:
Inspect Element much?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:56:47
I can't believe they threw out $100k worth of BTC. They could have bought a $50k car.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:28:40
And we _still_ don't know who they were.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:17:05
It also adds to the suspense when clicking...
