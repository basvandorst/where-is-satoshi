Basically you want to do one productive thing and earn yourself out of having to continue to contribute to society in a productive way. Existence justified. Everyone else can scramble now, to take care of the world. It's just not the communist ideal... It's in a way, morally bankrupt in that kind of society. Sure, you could do it. But it would make you a dick in that context. It's essentially anti-personal behavior on a political scale.

How much BTC can a setup like this mine? Per week? Per month?

They're not starting a new country, it's a Free Trade Zone inside an existing country. Maybe Chile or Nicaragua. It would be like a Hong Kong of the Americas, on crack. But that's okay because crack would be legal.
The real point to take though is that you are basing these claims on nothing but ideology so while I would never say it couldn't work, don't get ahead of yourself. It's intellectually irresponsible to make baseless claims. Anarcho-capitalism is an experiment that will take place inside our existing world. It will never start from a vacuum. There is absolutely no assurances it can work from this starting place. It may fail spectacularly.

Because this way the investment will start out - psychologically - as fractions of the dollar again, making it more enticing to newcomers. It's also a great idea to create more headlines when an mBTC grows in value to meet and then exceed the USD.
