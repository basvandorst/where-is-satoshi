...and what type of economic principles are those?  Are you talking about Keynesian or Austrian.  I actually know both sides.  I could regurgitate what you're saying better than you.  What you don't know is if there were a perfect Keynesian coin, that increased supply as needed to maintain stability and unit value with new units going to current holders proportional to the amount they hold, central bankers wouldn't even push that model.  Truth be told, I thought about making it but the Austrian model works if you have money that can support it--fixed supply, extreme divisibility, counterfeit-proof.  That's bitcoin.
1) No price volatility when it's used by everyone.  Look at gold--and that can't even really be used as a currency.  
2) Lenders will actually have to do real work in determining if the loan will yield more bitcoin back than they are loaning.  It's not like it's going to triple overnight once mass adoption settles.  Also, the interest rates will be extremely low.  Plus, perhaps you didn't see the part about just earning and saving accounting for a loan for yourself in x amount of time.   Impossible with the current model.  
3) People will spend more of their btc as they feel richer as the price slowly increases.  It's almost like you don't know people are buying lambos now.  Why aren't they just holding it again?  Why do you sell your house?  The value is usually rising?  I guess you don't know people never sell their houses?  
4)Rising price of btc is world wide.  What in the world could you possibly think that has to do with exporting.  Hell now you won't even have to switch currencies internationally and you can send and receive payments instantly.  
Conclusion:  Central bankers nightmare.  Peoples victory.  Also, it is going to happen so you damned well better get used to it.  Be stupid if you like and don't hedge your bets but you will hate yourself eventually.  Truly sound money has never come around before.  This is it.  This is what it looks like.  
Good luck.

Someone's bought into the Keynesian propaganda.  Hmm...I wonder what would happen if prices keep going down because the world used a fixed unit currency that was easily divisible and transferable.   We couldn't buy and do more stuff with the same amount of money now could we?
Anyone know how to feel about spending money when saving constantly gives you a loan?  Save bitcoin for a month or two and boom--there's your small business loan.   No one would ever weigh whether they could earn more just saving or starting a business with that new value now would they?
Of course no would would spend it right?  Just like no one ever takes the gains they've made on investments and spends that.  People never sell their houses today because the value keeps going up.  We all know that.  
Shh...no one tell him about the Austrian theory of economics.

I literally just showed you how it's nearly as stable as the US dollar.  You seem to think that 1 dollar being 1 dollar makes it stable.  Go learn what cpi is so you can have an intelligent conversation.   


What does that have to do with anything?  We're talking about selling assets that are rising in value.  You know, the thing you said people don't do.   


Yes I love endless wars and a super rich elite class that does nothing while controlling everything.   It's great!    


..and I can do it with Bitcoin--worldwide too!
 


The truth is both of us are speculating on this.  The fun part is--we get to see as bitcoin sucks the value out of USD and replaces it.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:18:10
Gold can't even be used as a currency and it still has decent stability compared to this:  
  
That certainly doesn't look that stable to me--other than the general trend of not being able to buy as much next year as the year before.  Such sound money.    
You're not actually thinking the dollar is stable because 1 dollar always equals 1 dollar are you?  
Truth is though gold is still not a good comparison because it's only a speculative hedge as it doesn't have the ideal properties of currency I described earlier.  
 
You're confused about a lot of things.  Market cap is the result of total units x unit price.  You don't increase or decrease market cap.  You keep saying that for some reason.  That's silly.  You increase or decrease supply.    With any currency if you left supply alone, it would fluctuate until it reached it's absolute adoption point.  If you and I traded together using our own currency of 100 coins, it would only have as much value as the two of us together would give it based on the amount of trade we did.  If we add a third person, the unit value would increase and so on until it reached absolute adoption.  At that point it's a function of quantity of trade and and units being lost--on a macro level anyhow.    


Well that's new in the economic world.  You should teach a class on your theory of central banks manipulating demand.  That's kind of funny.   Truth is though, you're actually right on that and what they do is evil but yeah...that's not the official line.. 
 Officially, they just control supply. 
     
  


You're conflating an infinite increase in value over time with a constant rapid increase.  Perhaps you don't know the dollar infinitely decreases.  Maybe go look at that cpi chart and really try to understand it.   


They will spend regardless.  It's like you think people never sell their houses.  I'm pretty sure you don't understand what I'm saying with this.  A house is money.  Gold is money,  Money is a house.  Money is gold.  Everything is money.  We still trade these things.  Spending is trading--buying and selling EVEN with money.  Ever hear of the forex market?  The USD is no different than anything else?  We're talking about trading ultimately.   According to you no one would ever trade their house because the value keeps going up--but they do.  You really seem to struggle with this.

You're repeating yourself bot.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:30:28
Want to compile a list of merchants that have left bitcoin core vs those that have left bitcoin cash?  Let's do that!
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:53:26
Why does BCH need proprietary side chains like Blockstream?  They didn't cripple the main chain and it's not a company looking to make a profit like Bitcoin Core is now.  
Also, if LIghtning ever works, it will work cheaper, better and faster on Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:43:01
You have terrible comprehension skills.  You just keep repeating yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:09:50
Come on man!  You can do better than this!  I'm waiting on your next batch of lies.  You sound like a parrot though.  You're repeating yourself.
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:17:58
I'm surprised they let you walk out with no confirmations on Bitcoin Core.  Use Bitcoin Cash for Zero Conf.  Bitcoin Core destroyed Zero Conf.  
If people want to use Bitcoin Core for payments they would be best to use the proprietary Liquid from Blockstream until Lightning actually works.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:57:56
If you want absolute security you wait on confirmations.  This has always been the case.   It doesn't matter though when you go through payment processors as they guarantee the zero-conf transaction.  You seem to ignore that.   
What is NOT safe is trying a Zero Conf transaction on Bitcoin Core as this guy did if you don't use a payment processor.  That is absolutely not safe because Blockstream put in replace by fee.  Since he used a payment processor in all likelhood it's still good to go but the fees will be nuts for the poor merchant.  That's what happens to a purposefully crippled coin like Blockstream..err Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:08:43
I'll tell you exactly when to short Bitcoin.  I could write a paper on it.  Just wait for the alt market to pull back.  Bitcoin will always pull back further.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:09:23
So you're saying Blockstream Liquid transactions are Bitcoin transactions--where is that in the white paper?  Derp.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:11:23
See when it comes down to it, you can't defend your lies.  If merchants weren't getting paid in BCH they would be abandoning it--only the opposite is happening left and right!  
Liars always get exposed.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:34:36
I absolutely won't delete them!  According to your own words, which probably is high, 10% are invalidated by double-spend.  That means 90% go through just fine!  So Blockstream killed this because they wanted to sell t-shirts?!? That's just nuts!!!!   We're talking about instant buys at point-of-sale terminals for low-value times.
If you look at the transactions it's super easy to see why most were confirmed.  The fees were too low!  Not only that, most vendors that accept 0 conf do so through a payment processor that guarantees the transaction as they simply run statistical analysis on the likelihood of double-spends.  That's the way it was done for years as Bitcoin advanced before Bitcoin Core decided to lock down the block size.  It still works great with Bitcoin Cash!  
So you can spend and receive on Bitcoin Cash as a customer and a payment processor with assurance and with high speeds.  Too bad you can't do that with Bitcoin Core!
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:50:14


You're really struggling here.  This is 0-conf.   You go through payment processors that guarantee the transaction.  You don't have to worry about it and you ALWAYS get paid.  
How long have you been in bitcoin.  You're confused by the fundamentals.  It was always this way and it works great for small value-items.   Payment processors use algorithms on the likelihood of the transaction going through and you don't have to worry about it.  
You just spend your money and accept your transactions!  The way it should be and always was before blockstream corrupted Bitcoin Core.  Bitcoin Cash still works GREAT!  Just like the original Bitcoin it is.  They should have called it Bitcoin Classic like the whole Coke debacle.   That's a perfect analogy only Coke actually realized they were wrong and reversed course.  Blockstream just wants to sell their side chain products.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:37:17
Bitcoin NEVER rises on it's own.  You're smoking something Mr. Ad Hominem.  
BCH can scale with Lightning if it ever starts working.  Stop lying.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:07:44
BTC violated the protocol with Segwit.  
BTC violated the protocol with Replace-By-Fee.   
0-conf is the same as when Satoshi was around.  There is nothing BCH changed there.  
YOU SUCK AT DEFENDING BITCOIN CORE!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:15:07
Bitcoin zero-conf transactions are useless unless you use a payment processor.   Hell that's the nature of RBF.  It's literally designed to let another larger payment take it's place.  It's in the fucking name you dolt.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:54:05
You're doing a TERRIBLE job defending Blockstream....err Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:12:43
You're repeating yourself bot.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:12:29
That's zero-conf.  You're comparing zero-conf to confirmed transactions.  Everyone could see you're a liar if this sub didn't mute these conversations.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:11:51
Everyone make sure you check out his link in case he deletes it.  
  
He literally just proved my point.  The original is in the original transaction column.  The double is the double spend attempt.  Notice they say "lost".  That simply means they were detected and failed.  
Is this guy arguing for me here?  Thanks for the link @_date: 2019-08-20 06:27:38
Did you look at the price to node ratio?  The price to node ratio of Bitcoin Cash is MUCH better.
@_date: 2019-08-19 04:39:33
Currency=can buy and sell shit with it.   Simple.


They do when they are the best and all the others are scams with folks at the top creating as much as they like without anyone being able to tell.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:03:31
Lightning absolutely works on BCH.  Why do you keep lying?  It doesn't need it though.  
The block size is entirely sustainable.  You can't just make things up and have them be true.  Bitcoin Cash devs are constantly looking into how to increase the block size safely.  That's what the Core devs were supposed to do but they wanted to cripple bitcoin to sell their products.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:05:46
So show us the merchants that have lost money on zero-conf that were going through payment processors.  You'd think they would be leaving the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem left and right but they are GAINING!
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:14:54
All of Bitcoin Core zero-conf transactions are unsafe due to RBF.  Bitcoin Cash zero-conf transactions are much, much safer.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:09:00
So you think this merchant didn't get paid?  You think he didn't use  a payment processor?  Why are you lying?  Where are all the massive amount of merchants abandoning BCH?  
Don't be a liar!
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:38:28
Honestly BSV is more bitcoin than Bitcoin Core and that is sad!
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:59:05
You keep saying that and I keep paying for my stuff with it and the merchant keeps getting all his money.  Are you saying the merchants aren't getting their money?  Why sir, that's an outright lie.  Liars like you shouldn't be trying to defend Blockstream.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:04:56
Zero Conf on BCH is perfectly fine.  It's an algorithmic approach to the likelihood of double spends.  It's perfectly fine for the vast majority of transactions.  
This guy is all about ad hominem.  It's all he knows.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:35:16
Your guys literally removed Satoshi's opcodes.  That is the definition of a dishonest chain.  He also championed spv which is in the whitepaper and the Blockstream devs are trying desperately to get rid of.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:05:24
I'm interested in the merchants that left BCH versus the merchants that left BTC.  
It's not a favorable list for you at all.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:59:54


HUH!?  Bitcoin ALWAYS worked like this until Blockstream crippled Bitcoin Core.  Nothing has changed.
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:39:46
Low value transactions are perfectly fine with zero conf just like they have always been with real Bitcoin.  click_again is a troll that doesn't like the truth and the truth hurts for bitcoin core.  Go to to speak openly about the truth and what Blockstream did to Bitcoin.  
By his own admission, 90% of transactions go through and it's really just a statistical algorithm to determine which ones are safe.  Most go through payment processors and the payment processors guarantee the transactions they approve.  
click_again doesn't like people telling the truth about Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:04:48
Nahh, Bitcoin Core is the name of Blockstreams coin.  Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin.   
Already showed you how Zero-Conf is perfectly safe for small transactions just like it always has been even when Satoshi was around.  You really hate Satoshi huh?
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:07:15
Right...perhaps you don't see section 8.  
8. Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.
As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more
vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:24:39
Bitcoin Cash is far, far closer to the original Bitcoin than Frankenstein's monster Bitcoin Core.   They put back in the original opcodes Satoshi had in that Blockstream removed from Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:19:39
Man...all those poor merchants that keep preferring to use Bitcoin Cash because it just works!  Those poor guys!
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:19:07
You did what now?  You linked to a website that shows 90% of ZERO-CONF transactions go through!!!  You are insane.   That's what you're proving.  
So, with Bitcoin Cash, payment processors can rest assured that Bitcoin will work like it always has.  
See that's why Coinbase and BitPay prefer Bitcoin Cash.  Anyone that uses it does!  Let me guess Coinbase and BitPay are scams.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:36:32
Merchants are MOVING to Bitcoin Cash and away from Bitcoin Core.  You can't stop that.  Your lies won't matter.   The merchants that it does have are unhappy and looking to jump ship.  It's an easy sell.  Bitcoin Core simply doesn't work an they know.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:37:14
You're dishonestly comparing full confirmation transactions to zero conf transactions.  
Everyone sees how much of a liar you are.  It's shameful.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:04:30
It literally shows decentralization versus price.  Bitcoin Core decentralization does not justify the price.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:06:46
No, the fees most definitely are not lower even with Segwit especially during times of high transactions.    
  
Hell try it now.  Go send yourself some BCH and some BTC.   See which one has the lower fee.  There is no other way to put that.  It's just true.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:26:58
Lies, lies and more lies on top of lies.  I hope they are paying you well to lie like this.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:29:29
So they are being scammed and tricked and aren't leaving BCH.  That would make them retarded.  Since this is not happening it's clear you are lying!
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:11:17
I don't think this conversation is even showing up.  You got so thoroughly wrecked you embarrassed them.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:20:38
Segwit and RBF violated Satoshi's white paper.  That is super simple to see.
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:25:30
So then merchants are leaving Bitcoin Cash right or are you calling merchants retarded?  
Who is lying again?
@_date: 2019-08-20 06:32:08
I think I'll compile the list of merchants that have left bitcoin core vs those that have left bitcoin cash.  
That will set the story straight.
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:07:58
Yet you won't list these make believe merchants that are leaving BCH...odd.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:03:06
There are no vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Cash.  If there were Blockstream would have exploited them.  


That is my point.  Thanks for seeing it.  Then when BCH drops, bitcoin drops.  Best thing for Bitcoin Core folks is to buy Bitcoin Cash.


That's an outright lie.  I'll let you know when I'm banned here.  Not that you'll care.  


Yes that's called Liquid.  You don't even know what you're defending.     


It can only do 180 million transactions a year.  That's not scaling.
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:02:05
You "argue" weird.   It's all ad hominem and statements with nothing backing it up.  
Let me know when Bitcoin actually pulls out of a slump by itself without alts first rising.  It's only used as a spoiler.  That sucks for you and your clan.  
I'll have to delete these comments soon though so I don't get blocked on this shitty sub.   Want to continue on where you can discuss things freely.  I tried to discuss this with you in but you left.  Why was that again?  
When you say side chains, you're obviously talking about the Blockstreams product liquid.   You think it's correct for a decentralized currency to have to use the network of a company?
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:10:23
LOL!  BCH payment processors are now being exploited.  So, I guess Bitpay and Coinbase prefer Bitcoin Core then huh?  Oh that's right, they prefer Bitcoin Cash.
