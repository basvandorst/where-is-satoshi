Go to the head of the department. There was nothing more satisfying that seeing and old professor's office being used as a storage closet the semester after we brought formal complaints to the department head. 
Note: Be respectful, level headed, and bring a document with a clear cut list of your complaints. Was a huge boon to our case when we handed over a well written 2 page document instead of just rambling off the top of our heads.

It didn't get any love because it's just a monitor setup. There's barely even a glancing shot of the actual computer. Check the top of any length of time for the sub, and practically every one has a beautiful tower in the picture.
To say nothing of the super low quality picture itself.

Less than 20B of that is microsoft, which is less than 3% of Microsoft's market cap. The rest is invested in multiple things. Given that he's routinely donated billions of dollars to things, it's not too far fetched of a thought to be able to liquidate that 90B without losing too much value.
