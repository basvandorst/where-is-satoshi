i got interested in bitcoins last year at some point and my main fascination with it at that point was the fact it could be mined harnessing the power of the computer, i only finally got into it a couple of weeks ago due to needing a few things of SR (still havn't actually got around to buying anything cos i got too wrapped up in the pirate incident, i may never get what i want, im too into this now!) but what put me off last time is my piece of crap laptop would never be able to handle mining but this has peaked my interest a bit
to my main point how easy would it be able to mine using an ASIC and a malware ridden laptop on its last legs or could i sub in a cheap desktop and moniter and just plug in the ASIC or would it have to be a bit more complex than that?

lol i did it for fun bro, dont worry!
@_date: 2012-08-26 20:58:15
i never found it hard at all, initially i made an account with intersango, bank transferred the money with online banking, it was in the account within an hour or two, from there it was smooth sailing, bought my bitcoins and sent them to the wallet app on my tablet, whole process took less than 2 hours
have to admit though with mt gox it took a couple of days for my funds to clear, shame that intersango's going down to be honest, although its a little pricey in the exchange

i think your missing one fairly large point: one is a currency, the other is a kids game. everyone that got into pokemon was a kid who grew up, no-one grows out of money
@_date: 2012-08-27 02:16:12
i keep seeing these insane numbers thrown around, are you sure its not 7% of the original amount invested per week? it wouldn't be 7% of the 107% the week before, thats crazy
@_date: 2012-08-22 22:48:06
a lot of it is still speculation as to whether he pays full amounts out or just repayment of investments without interest or even partial payments of the total amount invested
Matthew could still lose and the odds are fairly heavily against him given the change in rate which Pirate couldn't manipulate to his advantage

would this not be bitcoin's value decreasing all currency regardless of exchange?
@_date: 2012-08-23 15:27:46
now im really confused, so many bets, so much money, so much speculation, i love this game
@_date: 2012-08-30 15:16:12
just wondering if i had a wallet stored on a memory stick, would it need to be constantly updated to retain it's value or is that stored on the address?
@_date: 2012-08-27 07:10:59
kudos for writing it all out but that's what i'm saying wouldn't it always be the same amount being given the 7%
so week 1: 10,700
week 2: 11,400
week 3: 12, 100
week 4: 12, 800
by the end of the year it should only reach say $50,000 instead of over $300k
the interest isn't taken into account in the next payment, for that to happen someone would have to withdraw and reinvest every week
i mean sure everyone would want the previous scenario but there must be a clause in pirates thread somewhere because keeping the interest in the next return is just nuts

@_date: 2012-09-18 10:04:20
sorry my mistake
@_date: 2012-08-22 00:19:46
ive got a theory of how this could pan out, bear with me.
so pirate induces FUD, drives the price down to pay for his scheme, in the meantime these cards are announced, pirate pays back his money and instead of FUD creating a dip in the market people keep their coins because the conversion to cash is easy, this stabilises the market and may even create a rise in the market due to security in the knowledge theyve got their coins and the easy option to cash out on expenses, hence more money is added.
and by the looks of it pirate hasn't cut and run, hes still on IRC 'sorting it out'
@_date: 2012-08-25 08:19:40
yeh thats what i meant, sorry worded it wrong
@_date: 2012-08-22 23:17:27
im glad that this was people's first sobering dose of what a ponzi is then, it certainly illuminated me and i didn't even invest, if he fully pays out now people will have learnt their lesson, and not been too badly burned. for a pirate he's definitely more of a captain sparrow than captain hook

a similar question i've been wondering on the same back as this: if perhaps the dollar does crash and in turn the rest of the current currencies, what would happen to bitcoin? essentially its non fiat and we ourselves ascribe value to it, however its overall worth is determined on the value of the dollar so would hyperinflation crash bitcoin too? or more realistically send it into hyperdeflation, im not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing since the value of the dollar would be worthless

@_date: 2012-08-27 12:00:41
the real question: what point do we buy again, whens the next crash and rebump to get a quick few BTC in? i dont fancy buying at +$10, i spose if we're looking at an average of $20 in a couple of months time $10 wont be so bad though
@_date: 2012-09-09 22:57:57
i don't think he's going to the bitcoin conference anymore, they'll eat him alive
i agree with what you're saying though, he made a stupid bet and he weaseled out of it, there's nothing signed so technically he got away with it but he can never show his face in bitcoin again, he's ruined his career. fucking idiotic.
he's done what he had to, he couldn't have followed through with it though, the only thing we can do is talk light hearted around it and as angry as you can be don't push it onto someone else who's being rational about the whole ordeal (i.e. downvoting titty-fucker)
people are variable they do what they can to survive, matthew was just a little more naive and gungho than most but he's paid for his actions now.

@_date: 2012-09-09 22:34:42
what? seriously he's not paying?! i thought he may have some saved up from the early days or something to make up for the amount that pirate took but seriously?? i'm not saying i wouldn't have done the same thing in that position but i certainly wouldn't have laid a bet on like that, he took it way too far, he should have known better. 
i mean goddamn. i thought he had a trick up his sleeve but not paying people is just dishonest, don't make bets you can't keep, jesus christ.

@_date: 2013-04-10 00:52:08
If we look at it not in terms of a dotcom industry but the actual internet itself and how quickly it was adopted then we get close to what bitcoin is. It's not like we're investing in shares of a company, that's why I said Facebook as well (aside from their share selloff).
It's like we're the first house on the block with a colour TV, we're learning to use this new technology and it just so happens to have a dollar added to it. People look at it like it's a company to invest in but it's completely abstract from the norm so you have to throw out what you know about stocks and companies.
Then you could look at it as a fledgling currency, one not tied to another like the Euro to the Dollar but one that can grow and expand into as small or as large as it wants to be. It's not like that though, it's more like a rare materiall like gold and silver with a limited supply.
It's all of these things but our ideas of them are different to bitcoin so whatever model we use to describe it will fall short. It's born out of a belief that we have no need for financial institutions, it's an economic algorithm which corrects itself. It's tailored to the needs of the common man and relinquishes human error. It's a living, breathing economy that doesn't need a leash to flourish.
And after hundreds of years of being kicked around by the people we pay to control our economy, we finally have something that does it all by itself and I would gladly give every last penny to give it a fighting chance.

I dunno, are we counting the fiasco in 2011? I would say that was a minor hiccup in the launch of SR and the real work on BTC didn't start til early last year.
However I am also hesitant in saying it'll fall as much as gold did. We're going up again. Especially with all the recent interest from investors.

No, not even close, there are $13,000 worth of coins moved every second. At yesterday's price it was about 50btc, we see that kind of trade in just the tiniest of walls.
[This]( is probably what did it, mixed with sell bots, unbacked orders and Mt. Gox's horrific servers.

Why didn't you remove the option to 'false-trade' when you first knew about it? The very next day the same thing happened but with DDoS's too. 
Also the shutdown seemed to reduce the momentum of the crash. Why didn't you think of doing this the first day?
P.S. You're down, yet again. Shouldn't you be fixing it instead of faffing around on Reddit?
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:34:09
Erm, you know, or the fact that the US unemployment figures that were released yesterday were the lowest in five years.
Everything tanked, except of course the dollar and, not surprisingly, oil.
I think though it was a maelstrom of everything at once and the rising dollar was just the final kick in the shins. ~~Bitcoin seems to be recovering though, so fingers crossed.~~

Nah, it would probably be that the gap from 109-98 was made up of lots of 0.1 walls so when someone made a market sell they would drop 1btc getting down to a larger wall and then spilling the entire order onto the lower number.
It happened to me a couple of times then I vowed to never market sell again!

10 minutes later: Well fuck! I was sitting near 80 with $700 waiting on the next dip, then all of a sudden that happens. I'm gonna have to find those extra two coins elsewhere it seems.
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:44:11
As I've seen with my own bitcoin spending habits this will not be the case. I have things that I really want and I buy them. Even with the ridiculous amount of deflation we have now, I still give in to the urge.
Also once people begin getting a wage in bitcoin (a dream, I know) there will be less of an impetus to save and it will start behaving more like a currency.
However if people do save up here and there and not embrace the capitalist greed that is rife nowadays, would it be so much of a problem? I mean the entire idea behind bitcoin is an anti-capitalist one. This is just another aspect of it's value.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:31:36
Probably start spending it in the BTC shops, only problem is I don't want to spend them!
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:19:22
Meh, if people are stupid enough to lose their .dat file they deserve it. Their money however is still in BTC so it really shouldn't matter, it'll just contribute to the overall deflation which in the end aids us.

"Picture book example of an economic bubble"
Except this is a completely novel creation. We have never seen anything like bitcoin before, ever. I'm not talking about the rise, I'm talking about the technology.
This is normal growth for what it should be. 
Was the internet a bubble? Was Facebook a bubble? No, but they rose at a rate similar to Bitcoin. The only difference is we're combining a technology adoption rate with money. It'll continue to grow until it levels out and that's that.

It's a trading platform used for the stock market, so it should be able to hold against the lag and DDoS's.

What happened to Mt. Gox's facebook announcement to eliminate orders that don't have the capital to back it??
"Oh we'll get round to it next week."
It's fairly goddamn obvious that they are a severely flawed system, organisation and most of all management team. I'll never return to it, I doubt many others will either. Even if it was DDoS'd it doesn't stop them from fixing the elements that brought it to that state. It's been lagging heavily over the past few days which meant orders weren't going through and the someone's reaction to that was 'if I can't trade, no-one can'. Their complete lack of competance has just cost them not only their top spot in exchange ranking but most likely their entire company as well.
They should have stuck to Magic the Gathering.

Come on, the guy got into a crash on his way to 'pay him a visit'. I find with bitcoin it's less keyboard warriors and more smart investors that live in the real world but stumbled upon an internet jackpot.
Also note that joey hasn't been seen in a few days and multiple people had reported him for fraud, prostitution etc. There is likely an unseen resolution.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:31:06
They are now, but my silver and gold took a little dive when they first heard about it. The Bitcoin market is a little less...structured, however, it's like a waterslide.
I agree about the propaganda though, I was a little confused when I saw the charts. 
"Why would the dollar be rising if there was the worst unemployment in five years?
Wait what? It's the *lowest* in five years?! That can't be right."
I mean everyone knows we're in worse shape than 2008, we have people yelling this 24/7 on every news channel. Why can't they admit it? Not to mention the other news yesterday about the ECB, the US is in way worse financial affairs than the EU. Why should they get the fanfare while the EU gets dragged through the mud?
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:58:10
So...what happens now? Is there going to be another surge in popcorn and tissue sales?
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:53:55
When I first heard about bitcoin a couple of years ago now, I was fascinated. I explained it to friends and they thought I was mad, so I reconsidered putting faith, and money, into bitcoin. 
By then however, I already knew a fair amount about how economies worked and thought instead I'd have a go at (fun, non-money) day trading through eToro. I had soon lost the entire $10,000 starter amount and gave up on it.
A year later I found bitcoin again, decided to give it a go and here I am; knowledgeable on world economics, up $2000 and still looked upon as one-of-those-get-rich-quick-scheme-idiots. Their loss I guess.
The main thing that's kept me so glued to the currency though is the risk. The fluctuations, the folk tales, the world events influencing bitcoin spikes, it's the whole culture surrounding the bitcoin and the ideology behind it. I feel like I'm part of something and part of something big, created by people with pure belief in it's politics.
And it feels good.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:19:51
Cross fingers then. I have a little panic attack whenever I withdraw btc and they don't show up in blockchain for 20 minutes, that must be a nightmare.
@_date: 2013-03-24 03:27:29
I know, that's what is part of me interested in mining in the first place. I feel I should know about hardware more than software in the early days yeah?
