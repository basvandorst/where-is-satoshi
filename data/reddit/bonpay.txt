Well, this one is very arguable. You can avoid disclosing your private info if you use services which don't require verification.  
Edit: However, I rewrote it to be more precise. Thanks

The part of gold is getting smaller and smaller while the most of bank reserves are in currencies. Anyway, as you have stated in your other comment – we can witness an evolution of money.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:15:59
while many believe that Bitcoin could be better money than their national currencies, most of them still cannot imagine the existence of Bitcoin without fiat.  
The government usually understands your desire for more privacy as something illegal. Because (in their imagination) if you don't wanna to be 100% transparent and public – you have something to hide that means you are criminal

That's a long process. For example, gold is used as a store of value, but fiat has almost replaced it entirely.
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:20:28
Thank you for noticing that to me. I will fix now.

People are in search for better payment solutions and that's why we need as many alternatives as possible.

Amazon and Tesla have much more differences than Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
Last ones operate on the same market. You are right they target different market segments, but the market is the same (can we name it cryptocurrency market?).
Surely it is possible that both will be successful. 
However the first place is always unique. It is impossible to have numerous winners.

Bitcoin is already regulated in some countries. What do you think about BCash legality?
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:28:53
It is impressive!

Should be "Spend Bitcoin"

DLN (Decentralized Liquidity Network) is our solution to resolve the liquidity issue. It is the system which will be based on the interaction of several smart-contracts that enable liquidity providers, rich individuals as well as Bitcoin exchanges, safely cooperate rather than compete and provide their customers increased liquidity. Participants don’t need to trust each other as everything is cryptographically protected. Bonpay will be one of the equal participants of Decentralised Liquidity Network and the first who invests in it.
DLN solution from Bonpay will give both cryptocurrency community and traditional business to use one service for conducting fast and secure transactions. DLN will give the opportunity to avoid unnecessary fees as it will directly connect any two network agents willing to make a deal.
If you have any questions left, will be glad to answer.

I am sorry this happened to you. At least next time you will be careful this never happens to you again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:05:12
I hope it won't result in the opposite process :/
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:07:16
I believe Belarus did the same thing in 2017, they removed 3 zeros and it wasn't a big deal
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:46:55
Are you legally working for a company, or you are a freelancer? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:36:28
yes, it is possible until someone will prove the opposite
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:51:07
I would instead say that BTC is growing slower, but not falling. This is a normal thing considering the market capitalization of Bitcoin.
