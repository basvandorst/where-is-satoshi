what incentives besides privacy are there with using bitcoin during transactions?  i know i can purchase a gift card from gyft and use ebates and get a percentage off.  i can easily just use my regular credit card that comes with 1% off all purchases.  
is there something that is comparable with these credit card rewards?

the transaction i made over at coinbase was for $1200 USD.  hardly any wait IIRC.

i recently deposited over 900USD on the 4th.  The shit is still pending today.  I used my bank and not CC, so there shouldn't be any fucking time in between.  I used my bank over at coinbase and I don't remember waiting for any unreasonable amount of time.  fuck circle.

i'm currently investing in bitlendingclub.  
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:53:10
any of them freaking out about the current situation?
@_date: 2015-08-18 12:36:45
which site do you use?  i used 5dimes and they only allow deposits with bitcoin, but not withdrawals.
@_date: 2015-08-04 04:20:06
what about getting on bitlendingclub? you can build up your loans,  get enough credit and get bigger loans for equity/trading

i'm pro bitcoin, but the lack of bitcoin isn't a reason there's a leaked e-mail list.

lol.  fear monger.  why even have a screenname like that unless you want people to sell on purpose?  this guy is either a trader, in it for the short game, or wants the price to stay low so he can horde as much btc as he can before some paradigm shift.
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:47:08
nice work man.  do you still keep in contact with any of them?
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:50:04
it's not even cool yet.  uber hipster over here.

circle sucks a fat dick.  don't use them for anything.
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:09:50
why not just do changetip?  honor system.  other guy can be called out on reddit anyways.  if loser doesn't pay up, they will have forfeit that reddit account.  lol
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:12:37
report that guy and have him fired.

BLC has a better platform.  i'm currently on both.  i'm investing in this guy who's also on both.  pretty crazy because he's got like 59 btc in active loans, but his rep is 100%.
check this dude out 
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:21:50
yeah, i was trying to transfer and got the same shit.  fuck

no wonder there are so many Venezuelans on bitlendingclub.  seems like most of them are scammers too. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:38:26
just buy a giftcard from gyft.com using ebates and you get extra 1% off.

skeptical and cynical me believes stock manipulation.

i've been keeping up with bitcoin since around/before the silkroad.  i have an account on localbitcoins for over two years.  
my money was stuck in shitty stocks and i was waiting for them to go back in the green.  
a few weeks ago i finally pulled out all my shit from stocks and bought in at around 245.  
it's fun.  been on btcjam and bitlendingclub as an investor.  was really tempted to buy stuff off agora, but i'm moving to seattle anyways.  
TO THE FUCKING MOON, DAMN IT.

how do you put up an ad?  mycelium is just a wallet to me
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:01:15
how long does it take for them to up the credit card limits?
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:17:55
is it always 20% or just up to?
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:26:31
been using both, i can see why.  bitlending is far superior IMO.  way better layout and stuff
