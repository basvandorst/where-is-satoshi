Happy birthday in advance!

If I understand correctly, it's not a fork-able issue. The fork that allows it to function has already happend (segwit)

They didn't disable coin withdrawals, I've been depositing and withdrawing regularly for a few weeks now. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:01:20
Ah well kudos to him then :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:24:22
I'm not really sure of the connection here, could you explain for me? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:50:22
Welcome to the crazy world of cryptocurrency! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:27:32
If anyone is looking for a mobile wallet that supports segwit, take a look at Samourai wallet. It's still in alpha, but it runs really well, has a simple interface, and has a wide variety of security features.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:33
I have no basis for this assumption, but the way I see it going is Lightning gets released on the mainnet, and it takes about a year before it start getting widespread usage al la bitpay
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:14:25
Ive really enjoyed using it at this point. Cool privacy features, and it's a segwit mobile wallet so that's a huge plus! I haven't had a crash yet, but it is in alpha so I expect it eventually. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:55:56
As long as Apple Pay and Venmo allows you to. Since bitcoin is decentralized no one can really stop you from using the network. If you need a transfer done quickly, you pay a small premium. If you can wait for confirmations, you pay a smaller fee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:19
Wow this is exactly what I needed! Thank you very much :D 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:57:48
Adding hyperbitcoinization to my dictionary 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:46:49
Hope I did this right (this time)! Thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:40:45
Thanks for your help
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:38
True, I guess I was just hoping "ease-of-access" things such as LN, etc. would have been further along when mainstream adoption had started. Not saying I don't welcome it! Maybe this rise in adoption will spurn production to progress even quicker!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:13:08
It could have been, I don't remember the specifics.
My point is I want to help people understand that things like that have happened before and haven't destroyed bitcoin. Bad things happen, but we continue on!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:47:06
Sick meem broski
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:50:02
Thank you for this! And I appreciate the corrections regarding nodes/channels.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:45:25
Aww thanks for the info :) I think that tip actually covers a bit of the coin that I had in the other wallet (Pun totally intended)
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:26:14
First off I have to say Thank you for the well thought out and written reply. 
I agree with what youve said, and I'm a little worried that all this political drama will put a damper on individuals or businesses adopting bitcoin (or even bitcoin cash for that matter).
No amount of "Segwit"s," "Lightning networks", or "block size increases" will convince people to adopt if both sides are saying the other is bad and they are right.
I hope we all get past this soon and grow as a community :/
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:11:45
Then go use Bash and let us use LN. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:46:14
Very interesting article,  but Im wondering how big of a deal this really is. With DOA's is there still a person in control,  or is it 100% just a business run by a computer? 
@_date: 2016-12-13 03:38:04
It's honestly refreshing to see these types of posts again. People are excited,  and want to share that. It's a good break from some of the other topics as of late :) 
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:12:37
It's really unfortunate how everyone in this post on r/btc are complaining how this post was censored. Even though I found this while browsing r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:05:06
Thank you for your response. What are some ways that someone with a bit of technical understanding but no experience help pave the way for better understanding and adoption?  
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:54:51
I get what your saying. There's still quite a bit of time left for the 'votes' to come in, so to speak.  Hopefully it does'nt need to be reworked. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:28:19
What do you think is wrong with BCH then? 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:25:19
My biggest fear,  which has been addressed in previous comments,  was that intimidating for someone looking in and seeing mentions to things such as Segwit/lightning network, and similar things. The basics are definitely easy,  and I'm sure that as it develops it will get even easier! 
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:10:12
I don't really understand that logic though,  don't the miners vote for or against something? If the miners vote against it,  doesn't that mean we rework the idea until it's more favorable? 
@_date: 2016-12-13 21:30:57
Is FoldApp working again? I tried using it a few times last week and it was down each time.
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:15:29
Okay, one last question then: Why do my transactions verify quicker when I pay higher fees if miners don't validate transactions? I think all of my confusing is stemming from my misunderstanding of this...
Thank you for taking your time to explain this be the way!
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:45:20
I don't want to to make a full thread to ask this,  but...
I keep seeing people say "well,  the miners just need to upgrade. " in response to people asking about why segwit's adoption numbers are so low.  Am I misunderstanding that when a miner upgrades their system to run with segwit,  that it's them voting in favor of using it?
I hold no strong feelings either way on the subject,  and run a segwit full node,  but I feel it's a little unfair to say things like "they will come around eventually", it comes off as someone saying "oh,  they will vote for X candidate eventually" (maybe not quite like that,  but similar)
When I look for answer regarding this I either get a far pro-segwit response,  or a far anti-segwit response, and it's a little alienating...  Thanks in advance for any response. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:31:27
Fantastic analogies! What do you think is slowing down the growth process? Or do you think that is just the nature of these kinds of things? I'm excited to see what acts as the catalyst for bitcoins growth in the future! 
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:24:29
Cool, I'll try all that, thank you!
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:29:25
Ok that makes sense,  thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:12:38
So both miners and full nodes validate transactions? I'm sorry I'm just confused :( I thought miners got paid to do the validation and the discovery of new blocks
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:34:50
Don't miners validate transactions? How does running a full node do that? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:47:35
Aha,  so miners put the transaction into the block chain,  and nodes confirm that it's there? I'm simplifying of course. I think that was the word that was tripping me up, confirm. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:53:48
I'm wondering this as well,  and I see three answers that all say different things.
Is running a full node a signal of support to miners,  but not a vote? Both a signal AND  a vote? Or nothing significant in terms of voting? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:58:57
I'd definitely be Interested in trying it, more so if lightning network is used.
 Do we send funds between accounts on the app or is that handled separately from our own wallets? Additionally, is there a form of escrow service? If not, what keeps me from getting someone's advice and not paying out?
Not trying to sound critical, just genuinely curious! :)
@_date: 2016-12-11 04:53:48
That does seem to complicate things. It does help explain how the answers were incomplete, yet not completely wrong. Thank you! 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:09:05
That is a bit of a relief honestly,  I imagined that every user in the future would have to understand the ins and outs of PGP and the technical terms used here frequently.  Things such as forks (of any firmness), 51% attacks,  etc can be a little daunting for someone who just wants to use a private, secure,  and decentralized currency. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 03:59:22
Hah I just discovered the bitcoin talk pages on Wikipedia  yesterday and have read through almost all of the edit notes for that page xD He definitely seems to know what he's doing. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:20:16
Is there an option out there that allows people to discuss bitcoin without all the "under the hood" things coming into it? I feel like this subreddit used to be something like that a couple years ago when I first became interested.
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:21:38
What if the miners just dont want to? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:32:42
It unfortunately is no longer available. Hopefully when lightning network gets implemented we can go back to doing things like that! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:54
Can I use the wallet without having to make an account? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 05:48:36
The very first bitcoin transaction was sent with that message attached, to verify that it couldn't have been sent prior to that time. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 06:09:09
Sorry, yes it was the headlines of  "The Times" on the third of January, 2009
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:38:15
When I had it in my phone (Galaxy s7) it never actually loaded, except for one time. Unfortunately that one time was as I was leaving the store that I wanted to use bitcoin at :(
I don't know if anyone else has had issues with it, but maybe it's worth a try for me to reinstall it. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:46:12
Oh sorry, I misread that as the value goes up because you spent it, my bad! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:11:57
How does the value of btc double? 
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:56:39
I don't have to respect anyone to recognize a valid argument.
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:45:45
Isn't it suppose to be a digital cash? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:21:24
Gotcha! So I get what your saying now and agree with you. I'm trying not to come off as rude, and I apologize if I have.
We can use it to buy our coffee, given a little patience.
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:02:56
If bitcoin is used as a store of value, or only for high priced transactions, how am I expected to "destroy the middleman" when I still have to use their fiat to buy groceries? At the end of the day the bigwigs buy up bitcoin to store their wealth, while still reaping the benefits of having me use their cash system. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:49:30
The two concepts aren't mutually exclusive 
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:00:23
Yeah, I agree. Additionally I saw a couple posts by an account that was less than a week, saying they were new to the BTC scene and asking questions. On more than one occasion they were pretty much told to shut up because there account was too new. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:59:19
To the Earth!  
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:10:45
I'll answer to the best of my knowledge; the coins you have will have will be the same value, because nothing is being doubled. 
It was explained to me like this, The chain itself will split, so when you make a transaction to some people your coins will have moved, but to others (on the different chain) your coins will still be unmoved.
I could be wrong, but this still doesn't allow you to spend extra, but it could mean that the person you transact with might not get your coin. 
If this is totally wrong, I hope someone corrects me, because I too would like to know. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:11:46
Yeah, I support that, absolutely. With it bitcoin can be used as an electronic cash, to buy things such as coffee. So I still don't understand why you said what you said at the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:58:11
Might be a stupid question, but any will it lose 50% of its value? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:49:35
You know, sometimes people lurk these subreddits without an account, until they have a question they need answered. Not every new account is a troll. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:11:05
Right, for a major company. That chocolate shop earned my patronage on the sole fact that they accept bitcoin. I honestly don't really like chocolate!
Your absolutely right about the risk they take, and I'm sure as more people start using Bitcoin they will see that becoming more of an issue. Though I also feel that the owners of a small bussiness have thought about that and are willing to take that risk.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:46:11
I bought chocolates from a shop in Idaho a couple weeks ago, and didn't have to pay extra for using Bitcoin. I also didn't have to wait till it was approved. I paid a tip of ~$2 and went on my way, no issue. I could easily see it working in a burger joint as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:07:45
If this is being caused by a large group of miners, how can bitcoin be called a decentralized currency? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:23:33
What part of it centralizes it around blocks treat? Honest question, not trying to troll 
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:55:51
Cool I'll give that a peek! 
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:01:06
I agree, hopefully someone actually helps instead of just posting that usaf website as a response :/
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:15:12
The day of reckoning 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:27:17
Another quick question: Is it necessary to have a smart phone to use bitcoin in person? I assume it would make it a lot easier, but for the time being I'm stuck with my potato.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:56:17
I thought it freed up room to fit more transactions, doesn't that have a (potentially small) effect on fees? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:55:03
I keep seeing people say things like that, who sets the price for starting up a lightning network? Could I set up one for something like $1 and then just keep it running till I'm done with my transactions? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:17:52
Okay thanks, that's what I thought. I'm pretty pleased that I bought it when I did, yet sorely disappointed I didn't buy it two months ago. &amp;
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:21:21
Someone seriously needs to consider it. PotatoTech (tm) is the way of the future my friend!
