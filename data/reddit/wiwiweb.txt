You heard it here first, Bitcoin will let everyone stop working as we generate our own money.


"I saw a documentary about Bitcoin on TV once so I'd say I'm pretty knowledgeable."
Finally, this one deserved I copy the entire post:


If a major monetary system collapses and a large group switch to bitcoin, just realize that no one is in the driver's seat. Just like any government, military, corporation, or banking system, it will seek to maximize it's own influence. But this time it's a protocol which runs on silicon and employs humans, robots, and AI to do it's bidding. Watch out.

In that context, "Tout de suite" could be translated literally as "everything following", as in "I want you to do everything immediately following this conversation".
A good translation would be "Straight away" or "At once".
