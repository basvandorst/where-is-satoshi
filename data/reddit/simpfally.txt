Would love some kind of bitcoin dev subreddit, but I'm not sure there'd be enough people

How do you make people trust in the medication you're selling them?

Your answer was right there, some peps just downvoted and since nobody except trolls looks at "new" you never see the surface. Recurring problem in subreddits

You're right, I hope I won't need to.

The only few charities I know (and many from the humble bundle hehe) are already listed here. Thanks for the tip!

True, true.
If we consider there exist some virtual value of fee that won't get your transactions in the next block, I'd like be as close as possible (not really) to this value.
Actualy I just need to get an average value I can deduce from clients to avoid any loss, and I'd like to find this average myself so I could adapt to another coin.

I thought this sub got a bit more mature over the years.. Yet still upvoting random stupid 4-days chart trying to create hype out of thin air.
