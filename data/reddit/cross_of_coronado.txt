@_date: 2015-12-11 06:20:34
 Yes. But there are bad ideas and there are worse ideas. And the death of cryptsy really was on the wall for months now.
I'm even out of Bitfinex because I didn't like some news. Bitfinex is NOT in trouble but add soon as I hear anything remotely bad, I'm out of there.

Sure, it makes no difference if you get 20 Dollars or 20 times one dollar. But the admins of the subreddits might not like it and the one-time-20-dollars is the more efficient solution. Also we can cooridate our efforts.

I had that guy writing to me too. I was friends with BigVern on Facebook. Dont even know why really, but I sent him a friendship-request and he accepted, like maybe 2 - 4 days ago. Yesterday about this time, he contacted me. When I go to facebook now I can't see what messages he has sent to me anymore, because the Messages are "no longer available". I think he deleted the profile. But on my mobilephone where i have the Facebook-app I still CAN see the Messages, so here is our conversation:
BigVern: Hi there
Me: LoL, Hi! Its an Honor, Mr. President :)
BigVern: Hhahaha
BigVern: *bows*
Me: uh.. can i do something, can i fetch you something?
Bigvern: lol
Bigvern: Are you a moderate cryptsy user?
Me: not even that, I'm invested moderatly as well. I bought one sahre and Jesus knows I would buy more if I had more money.
Me: you know over at cryptostocks
BigVern: ya
BigVern: we actually have a project investor group I wanted to invite you into if you intend on holding any coins.
Me: how would I join, if i wanted to?
Big Vern: it is to help get USD investors, by showing them solid volume of BTC investors, as right now we have speculative btc investors (traders)
Big Vern: well here just read this lol
Big Vern: I wanted to invite you as well since you have an interest in Bitcoin and perhaps also a Cryptsy user, We are getting temporary investors for the next four months starting today actually for a 10 % interest of whatever they guarantee to hold on a ledger. With project investors by linking your Cryptsy account to us, this provides us with backing to show USD investors that we have a secure "solid volume" investor base. As we are trying to start the USD exchange in the next 5 months. If for some reason we cant start it within 4 months you can always continue with the project investors 10 % until we do have enough USD investors to start the exchange. I have the investors launch meeting at 12:30 pm est so if you are interested reply with your username and an amount to put down for your account that you intend on doing the hold for, we accept doge/vert/lietcoin and bitcoin, the inimum is 1btc for any denomination. Stephanie Murphy is also on if you have any questions you can ask her as well. Hope to hear from you!
Big Vern: Stephanie Murphy who is a project investor currently for Cryptsy.
Big Vern: project investor coordinator
Big Vern: anyway basically we link what you want to h old with a key that is to our program
Me: It does sound interesting, even if this reminds me of the conversation Leonardo die Caprio had with taht other guy over the telephon, when he started to sell pennystocks :-p No offense ment.
Big Vern: LOL
Big Vern: great movie
Big Vern: but im not trying to make you rich, just a little boost over the next four months :-D
Big Vern: your welcome to leave before the four months but we do not honor "pro rated" interest.
Me: Atm all i have in Bitcoin is about 1 BTC, so I could help you a little (as little as possible actually) but still. But I have to think about it. Do you have somethig more to read? Like a brochure or something?
Me: What i dont get - (Im german, maybe I dont get the meaning of words or something) - How do I give you the money? how do i send it to you?
Big Vern: well 1 btc is the minimum
Me: I know
Big Vern: The key links it to our project investor program.
Me: but atm that 1 btc is lieig around, doing nothing, that lazy son of a bitch
Big Vern: Then your account is put on the ledger for interest.
Me: so this comes to a good time
Big Vern: Yes actually, I was just about to go to sleep and noticed I didnt talk to you yet, lol
Me: ah, so I would just put 1 BTC in my Cryptsy-Account?
Big Vern: as our meeting is tomorrow 12:30pm est
Big Vern: to launch this
Big Vern: yes 1 btc in account and use the key thereafter once its confirmed
(More to come - i'm at work and the conversation is long)

ALWAYS ignore the wife. The wife does not know shit. She will bitch and bitch and bitch because you're doing something she does not understand (can't and doesn't want). Her girlfriends also do not understand. And that is scary and of course "creepy", because everything out of the normal is creepy for a woman. It's not a real hobby, and her girlfriends will likely ridicule her for what you do.
Of course once you HAVE the money, you're the hero. OTHERS will say you're just lucky, but not your wife. She will brag about how smart you are and shit.
I just take small amounts of money and buy Bitcoins. Never tell her ANYTHING about it. Never talk to your woman about financial "adventures". She will not understand and she will be afraid. Because woman are afraid. And that leads to constant bitching.

You know, at the moment it starts to feel a little better again. I'm not saying THIS is the start of something big. But I think we are SOMEWHERE close to the bottom and we can start working from here.

Look how they cheer and upvote 1234578. That faggot and his "rational" behaviour that he's has chosen to shove in your face. "You deserve it" says the faggot.
I however will tell you this: earning money is hard. And so far we, who have bought BTC have earned nothing. NOW is the first time since January, that we see some strong panicking. Holding now is hard because we all start to lose hope a little. Now is the time that we earn our ticket on board this ship.
Question is: Will we sink? Or will we stay afloat and sail? So you can take a life jacket now and leave or ride this storm out, not knowing if it will get us to the very bottom of the ocean, with no way back up. Then we'll have to realize, that the ship was built only from dreams. 


That is what you need to know. That you're playing a dangerous game, well I think you know that yourself, without the faggots help.  
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:44:16
Because then it would be ahuge 1-Dollar-Spamfest. I think its more powerful if we do this together. Also we must decide WHOM to tip. We need to combine powers. Much like Team Planet. And give 'em love!

There is! The most important thing he says is, that Bitcoin is here to stay because it is a natural development. Bitcoin, or more general crypto currencies can not fail. As much as electricity did not fail, as the railroad, or as the internet. There is a place for Bitcoin, there MUST be something like Bitcoin and that is the reason why it can not fail.

Yesterday, when Philae touched down on the comet and nobody at my workplace really apreciated it, I thought that there's really a gap opening. Because noone at my workplace has Bitcoins. They heard about it, but they don't own it.

Hm... I did not think about that. That DOES give me hope! Jesus! Imagine how cool it would be if at some point we just would start to get richer and richer because we've started to buy Bitcoins 10 years ago, when 99 % had no idea what was up. Or 99,5 % atm?

And even if you have horses, when you have wheels you can attach carts to them and transport stuff. Even without Roads and Horses you could build a wheelbarrow. The invention of the wheelbarrow was actually a big thing for productivity in Europe.

We should COMBINE our tips. If we go there and tip 50 Cents, they lol, if we tip 1 Dollar, they might still lol. If we tip 20 Dollars - The lolling stops.
Someone here should be a "leader" of some kind with an open Changetip-account, so we can check if all the money we send there, gets donated.
So, we send the money there to that person. You could call him a trustee and then we have some kind of thread going here, were we decide where and whom we tip. 
THAT is combined force.

This is what keeps me in Bitcoin. The price may go down, but as long as the whole Bitcoin-Environment grows, the whole thing is absolutely alive.
Back, when it was 1.000 Dollar,  it was overvalued for that time. At the moment it might be undervalued. I'd wonder what an "objective" price now is, knowing that there IS no objective price.

You know why that normally happens? Those people saying that "your bitcoin is dead"? Because they are afraid. They are afraid that Bitcoin IS the big thing we believe it is going to be and they are not on board. They realise that this could happen. It is a relief for them if they think that they don't have to worry about that any more. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:54:21
Nah, not that big. Let's say early 2014

I never wanted to believe that, because the broad "Public" has never been into Bitcoin. So how could this circle apply to us? Then I realized, that WE - WE - are the Public for Bitcoin, because we know about it, but in relation we've learned about it pretty late. I got into Bitcoin in January 2014. For THIS cycle I have not been an early adopter, but a late majority.
The thing is - I WILL be an early adopter. This cycle is true, it is what happens right now, but Cryptocurrencies can not be stopped, because they're the logical next step. And when this cycle happens again in 2, 3, 4 years? WE WILL be early adopter - compared to the people who will join them.
Third Option - Bitcoin IS a Ponzi Scheme after all. Then I'll have to take my cyanide pill, because I could not stand reading my old posts like this one.

I'm worried, but I'm too greedy to abandon bitcoin yet. I guess I will ride down the elevator to around € 200,-- before I think about selling them.

Oh, i AM mad. But not for the opportunity to get cheap Bitcoins. Yeah, I'm one of those guys! I will buy 0.2 or 0.3, come march (come paycheck). No big numbers, I know, but I only invest what i can afford to lose. And I'm up to 1 FULL Bitcoin (yay). I totaly believe in the concept of cryptocoins and believe they are the future.
But what really DOES grind my gears is that fat pig-eyed Mark-Karpelès-face and how he ignored those protesters when he ran into the building, squealing and squeaking, not even able to face them and talk some charismatic shit. (I'm not sure if he actually was squealing and squeaking and I am also not sure about that pig-tail of his and his pink skin and the stench, but that is how I remember the Videos).
I have a strong feeling, that this fat guy will get away with all of this and just fall back to his other career as irate Battle-Masterbater and professional COD-Shittalker in his moms basement.
And all I want to do is to see him suffer for what a incompetent sucker he is.

True, at this point nothing much can happen to me. If Id lose my job Id be on "Arbeitslosengeld" for a full Year. That would mean Id have to live of 1400 Euro per Month which is absolutely doable.

Also I have no debts at all and my parents are still alive and - absolute worst case scenario - could maybe help me out.

But even if! Most of us will be around in three to twelve years. And we still have time to put Money into Bitcoin NOW. All I want to see is a growing Bitcoin-Price. And Digital Currency IS the next thing. Because WHERE ELSE should money go. Its pretty much the development of EVERYTHING to go digital. In some years, everybody will be "Duh, I wonder why I did not see that coming". One Exception: Bitcoin is just the predeccessor of the REAL digital world-currency. Then we might be all fucked.
But if things work out - BOY will I shit into everybodies face, who laughed at me, everytime I brought the topic "Bitcoin" up, and after it succeeded will say, how LUCKY i was, that i coincidentally put money into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-08-01 13:41:08
Even if we reach 1 Million in 10 years, how many of us, do you guys think, will be tempted to cash out at 5.000 Dollars? 20.000 Dollars? 100.000 Dollars? Because we'll never be sure if it hasn't been the peak. Even if Bitcoin COULD make us Millionairs it needs a LOT of Willpower.

@_date: 2014-11-10 09:45:29
please yes. Because if we have another superbubble I'd want to get back into fiat for the time BTC goes down. And that never works well for me.
Going down? MUST SELL? Going up now? Damn, buy back in! Ah, NOW it is going down! Going further down? Okay sell! Ah, going back up? Buy back in! Oh, going down anyway?....

Thank you for the biscuit, but keeping it (well, or keeping ALL of it) feels wrong. I want to spread the love. But we're kinda not even "allowed" to tip outside of the Bitcoin-Subs because they might ban us for that. Which is fucked up.
Is there a list with bitcoin-friendly subs where we're allowed to tip?

Nah, it could take a while before we see much growth. But the important thing is that the Bitcoin-Community continues to develop. Cryptocurrency IS the next logical step, something that the Internet NEEDS. But it will take a while. I'm actually happy that it is not going too fast because I will use this opportunity to get more Bitcoin.

Look at the fucking chart. You don't have to be THAT smart to at least assume that we're going to see lower prices. Until then: Why would I buy? Of course: If the price goes up, I missed my chance to buy at the lowest possible price. But it is safer to buy in an uptrend anyway.

Seriously! Imagine the following scenario.
Price is 400 now, but will be 200 in 6 Month. Then in 12 Month (sigh) price will be at 1200.
So if he buys now for 800 he gets 2 Bitcoins. If he would wait and he buys in 6 Month he gets 4 Bitcoins - double - for the same price.
2 Bitcoins will be worth 2400 in 12 Month, 4 Bitcoins will be worth 4800.

Yes, the secret is: Buy more Bitcoins when they go lower. That way you can count it all together and you lose less money. Let me explain. It's simple but very intellichent.
Example: If you buy 5 Bitcoins for 250 (= 1250) and they go down to 40 (= 200) you have practically lost 1050 Bitcoins. BUT WAIT!
If you now to the smard thing, you buy 5 more for 40 (= 200) meaning you have paid 1450 (1250+200) for 10 Bitcoins. This means that you have paid 145 per Bitcoin. See? You just lowered the price at which you got in. This is called a pre-historical-timetrade. That is how people get rich. But wait, there's more!
Now this is where the magic happens! Try to stay with me. Do you listen? It's complicated: You have paid 1250 for the first 5 Bitcoins and eventually lost 1050, remember? Now you have bought 5 more bitcoins for 40 Dollars! And if the price goes even deeper - which it will - you have lost LESS money, than you COULD HAVE LOST, if you had bought 10 Bitcoins when the price was still 250.
[It's genius]( and you will be a winner!
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:30:02

Me too. I used 30 Paperwallets for the sleeping bag. Every paper wallet has 2000 Bitcoins on it. I know, that sounds like I am not poor. But give it some da... Some hours.

Well it is good news, so Bitcoin will lose a 5 %.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:43:07
Damn, I did not even think about the opportunity that some guy just sad there for a good picture. I'm slow somtimes.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:49:09
Nah, im in with 3BTC which I don't need. But I still kinda feel betrayed for all the blood i've put into Bitcoin. It feels like it SHOULD be the next thing. But it doesn't behave like it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:54:54
Yeah, I also think we'll go down to below $100. And then - if we are lucky - we end up in a wasteland of not too much movement for a few years. If Bitcoin proves worthy it will still develop in the background and grow in adoption.
The only important thing now is, that it surwives the fall, that is going to come. The fall down to 10 $ I mean.
I'll still hold my 2.32105 Bitcoins. Just because. Because selling it now and getting like € 500,-- for it would be okay. But imagine if it DOES make a turnaround soon? Its absolutely not likely, but I couldn't forgive myself.
In the contrary. If Bitcoin surwives and there still is development, I'll keep buying small amounts of Bitcoin. At least as there is no alternative.
But frankly. I think we're witnessing the end of an experiment.

I can't afford to buy right now and I hate it. Price could still go lower of course but I could have nearly HALF a Bitcoin for 100 Euros. It hurts.
Edit: It hurt that i can't buy right now, not that it is that low.

@_date: 2015-01-29 15:23:54
The secret is: Buy when Bitcoin is low. But don't buy if you could buy any lower!
It's a lot like what Mr. Myatori said, the japanse Karate-Champion of 1881, 1882 and 1895. When he was 86 he said:
"When the mountain lion has the spirit of the seagul and the shadow of the cherry blossom is short, anyway, fuck the chinese, drive them into camps and butcher them all."
It was 1944 and today many mistake this quote and claim, that he was a fucking radical Nazi, but what Mr. Myatori actually meant was, that you should stay the fuck away from Bitcoin, because you'll be broke if you don't.

@_date: 2014-02-14 15:45:12
Not too much. The demise of Gox is meanwhile pretty much anticipated, so this knowledge is already incorporated in the price. We already have seen a big drop in price because of Gox. Now there is nothing all too surprising too it, if it falls down completely.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:30:56
You lost it a fun way! And we are all here with you, losing money with you and enjoying it. So you're with good company and we have a blast while going down.
Fuck the money. You wouldn't want to miss this party.

Well, the hope was - and I do not work at a 7-11 btw - the hope was, that Bitcoin would skyrocket like a motherfucker and be worth MILLIONS!

The low price effects me lett than I thought. But probably I see the money I've invested in it as "game money". Also the Bitcoin-Idea is good and the infrastructure is still growing.
I'm not even sure if the low price has a bad effect on the growing Bitcoin-Environment.

@_date: 2015-01-04 18:07:17
Aaand 200 is gone.
Nah, price will hover a little, go back òver 300, then come back down to around 250ish, slowly drop to 230ish and then in a matter of days crash below 200.

If you are in germany I HIGHLY recommend Bitcoin.de
I've been using it since I started in January 2014 and it works perfectly. The smallest you can buy is 0.1 Bitcoin. It's not an exchange, they put you and the seller together. It works perfectly. I also keep my BTC online their - which isn't smart, I know, but so far they've never been hacked.

Its not so much about the gambling. Its about daring to do something new. Most people here on r/Bitcoin don't simply buy Bitcoins and that is it. Most of us do all kinds of interesting shit and - yes - sometimes it's a gamble. But what isn't?. We try new things. And at some point, some of us are successfull. So even if Bitcoin goes down in flames: Worse things have happend.

Because I know for a fact, that I did nothing but lose so far.
That's ony BAD piramd scheme.

9.000 Dollars in September 2014. Then price will drop back to 900, because everyone is afraid of 10000. Christmas we'll see 40.000 upwards. This year is going to be a rolercoaster.
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:59:53
The price will fall and fall and fall. I don't know if Bitcoin can survive. I have 2.32105 Bitcoins in total, but I consider that "game money" and I'll stay. Hell, I'll even buy small portions of Bitcoin. Give me one bitcoin for 10 Dollars? Okay, let me have 5!

There really are too many things happening to "keep order". I linked to something that Mike Hearn has said, now I'm worried that this might get me banned here.

@_date: 2015-01-15 13:03:41
Yah, but Bitcoin does not seem to be that system that cannot be tampered with. Because u/_btc_ is right. Bitcoin is 3.7 Billion heavy right now. Probably less by now. That is NOTHING. And the US could serisouly fuck around if they wanted to. Bitcoin would need some kind of mechanisms that prevents this.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:27:49

@_date: 2015-01-14 11:44:11

I have taken up a loan from a russian guy, that I know. He's a funny guy and told me to "better pay him back" by July next year or "he would break my kneecaps and worse". You know, like one of those movie loansharks. Funny coincidence that we were in his garage when we talked about it.
I'm actually very good friends with him and his gang (I call them the gang, because they look like swollen badass criminials, but they're really the nicest bunch of guys :D)
Anyway. I'l put those 250.000 Euros to good use and - of course - into Bitcoin over the next few days and I think, when I'll pay back Yuri in next July, I'll let him have some extra-cash, because he really helped me make a fortune!

Also I'm like ScroogeMcDuck when I have to give away my BTC. It really hurts. I can feel it. Every little part of a coins tells its own story.

Well some people bought gox Bitcoins long after it was known that they had lost coins. They hoped that gox would eventually pay. Which never happened

You can just divide the size of the earth in square kilometers through 21 millions. That way each tiniest bit of bitcoin stands for a certain space of earth

Nah, has there ever been a "Master of Money"? There are business-studies and stuff, but I don't think there will be a program specifically for digital currencies.

I want to add: Conspirational thinking it not bad just because it is conspirational thinking.
You are RIDICULED if you believe in a "conspiracy" and the media give you the most stupid examples for conspiracy theories. Like Roswell or Chemtrails or the moon landing.
But that doesn't mean that there are no conspiracies at all. And I'm thankfull for every Nutjob who looks into what ever he things to be a conspiracy. 99 % of the time he won't find a thing. But there is that ONE percent, when something is going on that IS a conspiracy.
Also: The fact that conspiracy-theorists are so heavily ridiculed by the media, makes me believe that they're up to something. Which - of course - is also conspirational thinking. But I don't care.

Nah. I went in with less than I could allow myself to lose, so I'm not worried at all. I'm riding this dirty Bitcoin-Hog to its death. Bitcoin won't go down to 200, to 150, to 100 or to 2 Dollar - I sell - and then you guys skyrocket away to 10.000.
I'll get rich with you bastards or you'll all go down with me because I'm not letting this pig go.
Bitcoin will die beneath me or take me to richess.

THIS might be not too unrealistic for once. Bitcoin IS perfect for gambling. If we can take some of that cake, the price might actually rise.

Know what I do?
I was very impressed by that post a while ago that showed how much of the earth you would own, if 1 km2 was that and that many bitcoins.
So whenever I buy bitcoin I draw my empire on Google Maps. The cheeper bitcoin are the more land I can buy!
And one day ALL that land will belong to me! At the moment I have 4 Bitcoin and own 27 km2 of land. :D

Get the fuck out and abandon Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin got down to 0.01 I would actually buy 100 just so Im able to say I have 100 Bitcoin.
Also I have 3 now and I'm holding which means that Bitcoins owes a certain - very tiny - range of its worth to me.
