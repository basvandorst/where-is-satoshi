I hate to say it but I think you’re not wrong. I’m still new to this but the frenzy is over. And now people are scared to buy in. I think it’s going to go much lower, but it will rebound fantastically... eventually. 
I’m purely guessing. But the masses are now afraid to buy, and I don’t know how many newer buyers are selling but I’d guess a fair number.

This is what concerns me. It sounds big.

It seems big to me. To me, it doesn’t = crypto is bad. It just means there might have been a huge pump/ponzi/manipulation going on for a few months now.

The tether thing is the likely reason.

If it goes to 5000 or 1000 etc, I’ll buy a shit ton more.

Cramer reverses position constantly based on what the DOW has already done.  He’ll tell you if it just rained.

Actually, fixingthat, I’m saying that bitcoin will likely be top dog in spite of some difficulties. If there is always a newer, better coin than the last, how are any of them special?  
I’m new to this and I’ve been buying other coins. Litecoin is hot, then it’s ripple, and then it’s bitcoin cash. What’s next?

That might be the biggest distinction.

And you take controlling interests with 50% of stock holding.

It’s going to like 2k, and it’ll eventually rebound big
