Yes, but if you look at the process of taxing transaction fees it works in a pretty similar way... so that if you send big transactions paying a high transaction fee, that specific transaction will be processed faster than other transactions that pay much less fee and so on... furthermore... very small transactions with 0 fee cost might never be processed....
So.... shouldn't we introduce transactions net neutrality???
@_date: 2014-08-09 19:03:47
This is gold info! The community must share this type of thought. I somehow sense intelligence services are trying to guess where the leaks are. Along with the fact that they are trying to gather what they can to REGULATE on their own interest or ultimately close bitcoin down and start their own definition of government owned and centralized digital currency ... that can never happen!
I’m not saying I agree with this sort of fraud ... I'm saying I believe that the decentralized aspect of bitcoin technology is the most precious offering bitcoin can deliver us; we has a community have the obligation to stand and fight for the cause. Let's not mess this up.

Could this dip even further the price! Well if indeed BTC was a bursting bubble and the higher point of its bloom has already past, shouldn’t we see this constant dipping has a repercussion of more businesses coming in???

Technically, and if what he says is true, it’s not stolen. Found, not stolen. To be stolen, someone had to claim the loss; from what I here nobody has claimed this wallet, or at least presented some real evidence that it was the real owner. So, in some sense, it can be regarded has money you found in the street and if nobody claims, it’s yours!
But to begin with… the best way possible he should find to solve the puzzle should be tracking the transactions made onto that Wallet! And, off course, maybe go back to the garage where he bought the laptop and ask about it…

have you tried exposing your problem at their trollbox? try to be insistent ...

"Now Bitcoin is truly "Green Backed" and will never fail because Free Green energy is the way of the future and can never fail thus Bitcoin will never fail."
so, fail it will not, meaning  impossible to fail it is...
Plain o'll rubbish that's what it is!
Correction, Bitcoin is not totally green backed... for each Khs spent there is a % that will help greenhouse effect! So it’s said and done that the digital currency mining industry is leaving its negative ecological footstep behind.

I still mine! but just to stay updated on the Know How and because I really believe in the technology!
I have one rig and some CPUs mining and cloud mining; mining mostly XMR and X11, X13, X15 coins (SLG, SSV, DRK...)
And I try to keep track of new launches and mine the most innovative coin!

As said in the article this process can turn out to be a little more expensive. However, there are not too many options.

Thanks! But that was one year ago... the same question should be asked again!

altough BTC is not backed by gold you can already trade it for gold:
“Quadriga CX is the first Bitcoin Exchange in Canada to offer Bitcoin/Gold trades! Users are now able to trade on our XBT/XAU platform, trading Bitcoins for ounces of real gold. You can also now fund your account with gold bullion, and request withdrawals in Royal Canadian Mint 1oz Gold Bars!”

technically you can buy anything with it...

Bitcoin is actually a great store of value. It is just not a good payment network, but like virtual gold, it works great.
Other coins already offer better payment networks than Bitcoin

Ok. Thanks for the heads up. Frankly, it sounded a bit weird to see signatures taken out... So, if I understood correctly, this new sig structure releases a certain amount of space which increases the capacity of a block. Is this right?
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:22:56
Nah... you should keep it! It is far better and provides a lot more security than the 2fa sms factor.

The prices are pretty different in several exchanges because it is not feasible to make arbitrage trading using Bitcoin. Since the transactions are very delayed there is no benefits in arbitraging with Bitcoin
