This guy probably bought in at 19.8k and sold at 12k lmao
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:27:37
Because they lock in the selling price. If BTC drops $4k tomorrow they still make $2k profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:42
They won't discontinue it because it is a huge source of income for them. They only pay per NEW customer deposit. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:08:59
$2k to me is nothing. I guess you're right, I was just trying to get her attention by offering to change her life. Thank you for your advice 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:00:57
Transfer little bits at a time then, make sure the first transactions went through then send in a bigger amount 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:16:48
Yes I know $2k is a lot to the average person. It was a lot to me too not to long ago, I guess I would be teaching her just to open the door of friendship again, because she hates me for what I did (won't get too much into it) and I feel incredibly terrible. It sucks.

Look up the lightning network. Bitcoin tx are about to get super fast and the fees are about to be super low

USD value would have gone up not remained the same if you held BTC while it was going up 20% 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:01
Thank you for the knowledge
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:39:09
You can really love someone and still make the same mistake twice, they don't correlate like you would think.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:25
BTC could rise to $20k overnight while we are asleep. It went up $2.5k in a day doesn't mean it can't go up another $5k in a night 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:42:49
No he got in at $9k
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:47
Major support at $9k, Wall Street knows this, they're artificially breaking all these past support lines, just hodl your coins and ride this dip back up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:19
Yes but with a huge increase in price over night how will the liquid be there? Let's say everyone buys at $100k a coin and next day it goes to $1m where does the $900k come from? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:15:21
All coinbase prices are locked in at purchase time.

Of course it will bounce back once Bitcoin stabilizes but today has been a crazy day
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:13:02
Either way, all's fair in the crypto markets, I'm thinking someone wanted to slander his reputation

McAFee denies it, and he said the blue ticker was Photoshop. Think about it, why the fuck would he need to beg for bitcoins? He's a mega rich Public figure. He's filing a civil lawsuit against the fake Twitter account.

@_date: 2017-12-25 20:59:30
Thats $150m worth of fiat, so if I have $149,999,999 I wouldn't be considered a whale? Lmao. A whale is someone with huge market influence. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:08:49
Sell BTC for cash, deposit cash in bank, then buy back at a lower price, thus starting the cycle all over again 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:16:26
Hold and of course you'll see some return in the long term

The bigger the BTC the longer the wait time... Relax 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:52:43
I don't check the prices that much just have a lot of stuff in my mind! How do you deal with that?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:49:10
Bitcoin buyers only care about 1 thing: fiat profit. Crypto is a long time away from becoming a real method of payment, not everyone has an internet device to conduct these transactions. Say you're out with a friend and your phone dies, how will you pay for your food with crypto then? Credit cards/ debit cards will have to be linked to your BTC address for it to work, but it can't work now due to insane price fluctuations

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:31:53
And how would you know that it will dip or fall? Short answer is that you don't. Selling today could mean losing thousands next month with no guarantee of dipping. People thought it would dip down to $7k or lower after it hit $10k and it did not.

Bitcoin is being used everyday! People are using it to buy alt coins. These transactions make up 99% of Bitcoin usage. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:15:45
Not recommend since it can take hours/days for funds to show up, by then a huge price fluctuation could occur
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:35
In the scenario people are using crypto to buy products like I said above, but what about the people that still want fiat?

It's not too late to buy. If you buy $100k worth of Bitcoin today, and it goes up 20% tomorrow, that's $20k profit. What you meant was is it too late to buy for my [insert income level here]

@_date: 2017-12-24 22:52:07
Multiply whatever Bitcoin you have by whatever price you think it will reach when you sell. Example
I think price will go up to 20,000 and I have 2.2 Bitcoin, if I multiply 2.2 times 20,000 I get a total balance of $44,000.
You can multiply your Bitcoin balance with whatever price you want to sell it at :) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:03:33

It's pretty beta to classify yourself as an alpha, beta, or XYZ. Why would you want to socially label yourself anyways? That's beta. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:30:51
So let's say you have $100,000 in savings in fiat and you convert it to today's Bitcoin rate, now you have $100,000 of Bitcoin. Now let's say Bitcoin drops 5% the next day and you had a bill for $100k due the same day. You wouldn't be able to pay that $100k bill since you only have$95k worth of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin has a lot to do with timing. You could buy at an all time high and it could drop the next day. Usually the price goes back up but no one can truly predict the future! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:30:40

@_date: 2017-12-06 08:05:21
By "losing thousands next month" I meant thousands in potential profits lost if you sell all your coins today. If you don't need the money today why would you sell after seeing the rate of rise? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:58:09
You're the only one that agrees with me 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:18:21
Look, the money is not made with bitcoin anymore, it’s made with Alt coins. Let’s say you buy $1k worth of bitcoin at current price, cool nice, then you move the money to a cryptocurrency exchange and invest in several alt-coins which some increase by 50-200% daily. Bitcoin is a long term hold, alt coins are short and fast gain investments.

Alpha, beta or XYZ are all social terms to classify yourself. And honestly I could care less about being an alpha or a beta because I don't give a shit about social status. I just loved her and wanted to help change her life.. she's 19 and works in retail and if it wasn't for my mistake we would still be dating. This sucks.

Don't use username/password that you use for other sites. Always use different ones.

That is an expensive lesson learned 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:00:40
It went up to $19.5k the other day. If Bitcoin will be truly successful then we can all expect unexpected prices in the days/weeks/months to come.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:44:34
Exactly this. When you invest in money you don’t mind losing it gets rid of emotions. You can’t let emotional money affect your analytical mind when investing.

@_date: 2017-12-25 09:22:42
Honestly I could care less about if she takes me back or not, I have the ability to change people's lives, and I guess I wanted to give back to her as a way of feeling better for my misdeeds. It's the only bad thing I've done in life and to reconcile it would make me at peace

Sell your coins on GDAX, bank transfer only takes 1-2 Days
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:21:45
Coinbase is delayed, check out their status page, might take a couple hours to show up 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:28:39
I just applied for a withdrawal raise. Is it worth it to send over BTC over to my bittrex now since GDAX is delayed or should I wait after the delay is over to send the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:38:20
Stop. Please. Internet beggars are even more annoying than real beggars. Strangers are kind but don’t ask when you’re not willing to give anything in return. This is really cringeworthy. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:36:36
You added it then the price deceased for bitcoin. Most likely, 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:36
When a majority of people decide to sell their coins 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:25:30
It's a fee on dumb people that don't know how to transfer to GDAX and send from there 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:07:22
Thanks for your advice. I guess you're right I was just trying to buy her attention again by offering her a life changing deal. Damn

You're right but do you care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:56:22
Sorry I still have the high from BTC going up so much
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:32
I think it will hit 9k before bouncing back up hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:19:26
GDAX doesn't charge any fees and even when I tried transferring to coinbase (uses the same back end as gdax) the result was the same, a lower withdraw than my balance. Wtf GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:25:38
Or a lot of money could be lost. Greed is a killer. Be careful using this strategy. If it was so easy there would be many more millionaires.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:10:54
Longer bank withdrawal times 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:02:55
Simply put, you bought high then price of Bitcoin decreased a bit, decreasing USD value in your coinbase account 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:07
The value is that it's a 1934 bill. They wont be printing those any time soon, lol

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:46
That already happened, amateurs were shook off with this dip, that was their plan. Now institutions/ wall street will be buying up the low priced coins. It was a slaughterfest.
There will be a sharp turn up as these big accounts buy  cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:34:48
Don't sell, buy at a dip. If you can't afford to wait then you probably shouldn't have bought Bitcoin in the first place 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:13
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:31:55
Gdax is owned by coinbase but is much faster with less fees. Can't go wrong with gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:24:32

@_date: 2017-12-08 04:35:49

@_date: 2017-12-25 10:05:45
I'm 21, she's 19. I could literally change her life. I learned a lot from these comments though. Helping her out would probably make her think I'm doing it to get something out of it. I mean I wouldn't mind talking again, but what do you think?

Bitcoin is an investment, govt could put regulations on it and it could crash drastically. Emergency means fast, you won't be able to cash your bitcoin in time for a same day emergency, usually takes 2-3 days for it to reach your account after you sell it in an exchange. I'd say have some cash in handy for emergencies and treat Bitcoin as an investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:39:32
Hold til the new year and you'll be happy
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:57
No. The big boys at wall street just got in. They're shorting the market right now, don't fall for it. Interesting this dip is after the futures and CME came huh? Yeah they're shaking out the weak hands to buy cheap because they know blockchain technology works and they're investing in the face of it, aka Bitcoin. 
Relax and don't look at the charts so often.

Well some people do actually get heart attacks from losing money, so always invest what you're willing to 100% lose. Think of it as lost money as soon as you put it in and the gains will be Soo much more rewarding.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:15
Of course there was insider trading by coinbase employees. Thats why prices started at $9500 at coinbase/GDAX. Already had sell orders in place. Like wtf.

Have a disclaimer that bitcoin rates are locked in live time. You’ll make a profit from holding the coins in the future as it steadily goes up in value 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:41:44
Insider trading from coinbase, Bitcoin cash being added to coinbase, holiday seasonal selling, there's a huge list, go look on Google not Reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:23
Nope. Coinbase will continue to be the  
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:46:10
Bad time to sell since there is a dip in price due to market manipulation, holidays, news, ect. Wait til January for prices to uptrend again 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:16:18
This is insanely risky. Lot of complications. Sending a lot of money and receiving money overseaseas is not an easy task.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:29
It will go up since market cap will go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:04:13
People buying bitcoin cash caused it to drop from 17-18k
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:22:28
I don't mean to buy her back with money, just a Christmas gift to change her life. I made a huge mistake and keep thinking about it from time to time and helping her out would let me have a peace of mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:02:44
Bitcoin billionaire walking around without body guards? Seriously? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:04:41
Thanks for your comment
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:04:52
Let's say you have 10 Bitcoin but still want to cash out 1 coin for $1m fiat just in case of hacks or whatever, what then?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:41:28
Transfer BTC to gdax and place a sell order then withdraw to Bank
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:52:41
Oh wow awesome insight 
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:41:06
Amen! 
@_date: 2018-05-20 07:30:49
Tell that to Patreon...and any adult cam sites out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:18:44
I am successful now like I said. I wasn't when we broke up. And she has no idea how successful I became after she broke up with me.
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:57:40
I thought the guy in the picture was Michael Jackson for a second
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:47:40
How much are you selling them for? If you’re serious, use an online escrow service. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:53:13
Use a vpn then use an online escrow service. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:09:11
I would choose to take both, but if I can take only 1, I’d go for the bitcoin since currently its trading at $5.8k. Who wouldn’t take $800 more.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:00:16
How do they know you paid? Also can you split payments with a large group (each person sends % of the check to the QR code)?
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:37:23
For tax purposes in case you make a killing and want to withdraw 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:26:57
Calling it a tenth of a bitcoin is fine. Too many names will confuse people since they sound like Alt coin names 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:37:16
It’s market average, it averages the cost of bitcoin across all the exchanges 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:32:55
Once strip clubs accept bitcoin then we’re talking! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:55:35
For which market? Because 10k hasn’t been reached in GDAX yet 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:05:24
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:40:46
 No. You lose your bitcoins. But you can use escrow accounts through bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:17:44
I can imagine a wall with all the dancers wallet address on it (maybe a QR code haha) and the guests donate/tip via btc. How awesome would that be 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:26:55
Put your trust in the system, and don’t be dumb 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:19:37
Yes because weak hands who have a lot of coins that bought early on will sell at $10k 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:19:58
It’s going to go to 11-14k by the end of the year. Your friend is smart buying later than never! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:39:46
No it’s probably the easiest transfer ever since coinbase and gdax have the same back end, they’re basically the same company 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:28:50
You can't buy and sell Bitcoin or litecoin right now on coinbase but Ether is available to buy and sell
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:36:09
Most successful crypto traders use multiple exchanges since some coins are exclusive to an exchange
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:28:47
What if bitcoin explodes and hits $20k by January? That would be unprecedented but I’m sure we all wouldn’t be surprised if that did happen! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:54:27
Oops I thought the title said June 2018z 
A guess for 2019 would be impossible to make right now
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:11:01
It will be after or during cyber Monday (today) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:58:37
Add identification and also link a bank account, banks have $7500 limit after you answer the security questions 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:41:07
If you go on support.coinbase.com it says ethereum is online but in all reality all three coins on coinbase are offline! Today was a huge smear on coinbase's reputation as an exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:54:43
Got the logo to ripple too, nice touch
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:33:33
You basically got the modern day version of finding buried treasure if this is true 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:50:44
How did you get push notifs for coinbase like that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:48:43
Here’s a tip: telling how much bitcoin you own to the public is like asking “please hack me” just stay on the down low. We don’t know how most people have but the income level of redditers are varied 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:54:16
Why didn’t you wait for the dip after 10k to buy? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:44:35
You said you had $10k blocked on their page? What do you mean by that 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:46:12
This makes me want to have pizza for breakfast, ughh
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:39:48
I’ve never used it before so I can’t say, but it’s an option for you 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:35:15
You need to start writing articles for a living
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:37:36
$20-25k per coin. I see exponential growth after the 10k mark is breached 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:09:20
The dip is coming 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:51:23
Buying at the dip at $15k? I don’t think that was a coherent sentence lol. Honestly the next dip will most likely be after the $10k mark. But if there is no dip after $10k there probably won’t be one for a long time unless something happens in the world against cryptos, but that’s unlikely
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:13:41
This would be a bad move for Uncle Sam since people will just start using foreign bank accounts to withdraw their bitcoin, it’s a worldwide phenomenon not just for us in the US
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:30
Do you know how much money people are losing in those few hours? A shit ton of missing profits from trade fees coinbase is also missing from being down, millions are at stake, I bet Coinbase internal team is going crazy right now
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:16:39
We will find out soon 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:22:15
Hard drive damage is the risk of having physical copy 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:37:25
You can meet up with people in real and trade cryptocurrencies straight to your bitcoin wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:15:35
Move your btc from coinbase to gdax to avoid any fees, then transfer from gdax to your wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:04:22
Yes but can you wait 7 years without pulling out
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:57:28
If the “Bubble” ever pops, savvy investors are going to buy it all in a heart beat which will skyrocket prices back up. Seriously bitcoin isn’t a bubble, it has VALUE! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:31:12
Yes you can 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:13
Same! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:19:54
Plot twist, this guy is the scammer trying to build trust. 
Nice try guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:05
No dude I'm saying most successful crypto traders use multiple exchanges 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:34:37
If you buy through coinbase, they lock in the price until they receive payment from your bank! So if I buy $9700 today and the money doesn’t get to coinbase until 3 Days from now and btc is $10K, I still only pay $9700 even though the money cleared 3 days later 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:17:45
Use a web texting site like textnow.com to get your verification code. It’s free to sign up for it and you can use it on the same device you used to type your reddit post
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:17:23
We knowww
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:29:17
Yes but only after bitcoin tax laws are more clear. Amazon wants no part in a huge tax problem with the US gov’t over bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:23:31
Keep doing what you did for years, hold it 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:30:20
We need all the nans to buy, the price will get higher and higher 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:31:16
Or maybe he should just use a trusted friends to get the verification code? Seems the simplest option
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:42:37
No one needs your attitude on this historic day 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:30:02
Pro tip; don’t invest on what you’re not willing to lose. Whatever you put into cryptocurrencies, pretend like you already lost it
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:36:45
Sounds like you’re getting screwed over from negligence on bittrex‘s part. I’ve never had a problem with them before, but then again I’m from the US
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:08:39
You can log into gdax with your coinbase account information 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:11:38
When people ask “do you think the price will go up?” Just say 
“If you think it will, then it will.” 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:20
This is ridiculous, Coinbase isn’t using their profits to improve their back end, they’re just sitting on their money like the rest of us
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:32:12
People are paying for a system they believe in, plus it’s historic! This will be in the history books for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:38:06
This is what push notifications are for lmao 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:15:04
And who are you to put a price on bitcoin? 
Bitcoin is a peer 2 peer currency, everyone as a whole dictates the price. So if we all sold tomorrow, we’d be saying the value isn’t worth keeping and of course the price will drop. But if we as a whole decide that bitcoins are extremely valuable (which is the case today) then the price will remain high or even increase
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:18:09
Especially on a smart demographic that reddit has. Upvote
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:28:42
Coinbase wallet is also beginner friendly 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:49:17
I use Crypto Pro, it’s $5 on the AppStore but is amazing. You can also set up alerts in Coinbase and that app is free
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:18:40
It might also dip before 11k but that’s for the future to tell
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:31:51
It was a chain reaction, one site fell down so everyone flocked to another exchange and then crashed that too, traffic is at an all time high since hitting $10k
