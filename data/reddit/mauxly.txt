My hairdresser thinks aliens made it, and sent it to earth the help us. Adorable!

I once had 100 bucks worth of bitcoin. And man, people made fun of me for buying in when it was 100. 
I do not regret that decision.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:31:02
Agreed.

Self half of it.
My little baby 'moon' is on the horizon. It's way more than I ever expected. 
Going to sell half, and diversify, keep the rest in for at least as long as I held last time. 
That way, if it really goes to the moon, I'm still on that rocket, and if it crashes, I have quite a bit of something out of it. 
And, I sort of figure that if the stock market crashes (as its expected to within 5 years) altcoin will surge.

Yeah, I don't think it's a great idea to go around talking about this stuff.

You don't now how to Reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:00:22
Oh, they have some great curves don't they?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:45:18
Mam. And yes.

It'll bounce back. When I got my first BC at a hundred bucks, this sub was chock fulli of 'Oh shit, PPL buying in too high!'. 
When it hit $600, people were euphoric. When it crashed back down to $300, PPL be like, "Armageddon!"
You are fine. 
Unless you put money in BC that you actually need to survive, or you put so much in that your opportunity costs will be painful of BC doesn't return more than the going rate in 5-10 years, you won't have lost anything.

I've seen it too many times. Freakout, sell off, rebound to higher levels. 
One of these days, it might nit rebound. And then, I will have lost a hundred bucks...in my mind. 
I have a set 'sell' point that I'll sell at regardless of what's going on in the market. 
It was my original goal when I bought my single BC at a hundi. 
When I get there, I might buy some back. Depending. 
Until then, no stress.....it was a hundred dollar speculation. A gamble.

Jelly! How much did you buy? Still have it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:28:56
Eh, it will for a while, then it'll start to grow slowly, and then jump, and crash, and repeat. 
Until ithen doesn't. 
But I don't think that 5 years from now, with even the most pessimistic outlook, it'll be under 5k. If you made your initial investment  (with am amount small enough that opportunity cost doesn't slay you) you'll be fine. 
Other than that. Ride the Rollercoaster.

Technically, he right. 
I was laughed at for buying in when it was $100. 
That was considered the top at the time.
I work with a financial advisor who, up until this week, encouraged me to cash out on my 'speculation' while I can.
Last week's meeting? He said, 'Bitcoin is in its infancy', which is different language by fat than speculation. He actually advised hold. 
People like us? We got into when it was a foetus. 
The people before us, got it sometime between ejaculation and the winning sperm ceremony. 
Yay, them, yay us, and yah anyone who can catch this train before it reaches maturity.

That's just as extreme as "OMG Armageddon!" when it dropped. 
It falls drastically, rapidly regains, then back to the slow rise until a surge, then panic, repeat.
On an interesting note, today my financial advisor went from, "It's just a speculation, gamble' to 'Its in its infancy, these fluxuations will level eventually'.
He basically admitted he was wrong. And, confirmed my hopes from the my initial investment....that I caught it at its infancy. 
This time, he didn't advise me to sell and diversify. He is OK with the hold.

I'm new to this game also. I figure that there's still a shitload of volatility. So I'm not going to stress if I buy at 105 vs 125 over the next week. 
I do plan on purchasing two bitcoins and sitting on them indefinitely, no matter what the market does. If I lose $2-300 dollars, then fuck it. 
If bitcoin is truly the wave of the future (who knows?) it could be a great investment.
One thing I don't want to get into is day trading behavior, watching the market and trying to sell high or whatever. Too easy to fuck that all up, and there are people out there a lot smarter than I am, with a lot more time on their hands, so I'll undoubtedly lose that game if I try to play.
And, Jesus, the stress...imagine that one day you have 50K, and the market tanks and then you have 1K, and you freak out and sell it trying to save that last 1K, but then it rallies again...
Fuck all of that. I'm plopping down an amount I can afford to lose, and making a super high risk bet that this becomes a 'thing'. I figure that the more legit companies, and the more international companies that take payment in the form of bitcoins, the better our chances are that this is the wave of the future. 
Bla bla bla...
Only put in what you can totally afford to lose. And then don't touch it, no matter what.

I got my first (and only) coin 6 months ago when it was $108. Right after the "OMG ALL TIME HIGH FOREVER!" of 200+, and then the crash.
Everyone was saying back then that the crash was proof that Bitcoin was 'over' and that only an idiot would spend over $100 on something that they paid $5 for.
I figured, hell, $100. Maybe I'll lose it. Don't care. Lets see.
Two days ago that $100 was worth $900. Now it's crashed again to $470 and rapidly dropping. 
I don't care. I figure that's a good thing. Maybe when it hit $900 the people who were hording huge amounts (that they got when bitcoins were pennies) decided to cash in, causing a reactionary sell off. 
This is actually a great thing in my mind. Hopefully some of the more speculative folks freaked out and rushed in to buy when it was rising, but since it's so expensive, they can't buy a shit load and horde them all.
Maybe the price will stabilize without these massive sell offs by the huge holders and people will start using them as actual currency. Which is truly our only hope for the long term stable growth of the bitcoin.
NPR story yesterday indicated that traditional venture capitalists speculated that Bitcoin could easily replace Visa and Mastercard. Do Western Unions still exist? Because if so, they would be toast too. 
I asked my husband, "When do you want me to sell my measly little bitcoin?" 
We decided, Never. I'll never just sell it outright. I have to keep thinking of it as only a $100 gamble that this could truly be the currency of the future. And if that is accurate, maybe sometime over the next 10-20 years, I won't need to 'cash it in' maybe I'll be able to pay off a huge chunk of my student loans with that coin itself. Or put a downpayment on a house, actually using bitcoin.
Or maybe not. Maybe it'll bust.
But I'm not about to look at these massive fluctuation and instability and freak out. My hope is, again, that the people who've been holding a shitload of them for investment purposes will sell at a price that's too high for most people to 'go all in' but low enough for most people to be able to afford a few.
And then, really, best case scenario is that after that, bitcoin slowly and steadily drops in value. Like, really slowly. So that people who only hold a few will stop seeing them as a long term investment and start using them as currency. Really, the use of bitcoin as actual currency is it's only hope for the future. And long term value.
That's my two cents. And of course, I'm fucking holding. So I'm a hypocrite here. The it's likely that most other people will hold too.
So who knows. It'll likely go all belly up.
Don't care. It's $100. 
TLDR; Nobody is ever gonna read this. It's too long and rambly and nothing that hasn't been stated before. I should just get a journal or something.

Please don't be too pissed at me for [doing this](
You might be right. I hope you are. But if you don't get rich by owning Bitcoins you really could make a living as a bitcoin investment broker on college campuses.
