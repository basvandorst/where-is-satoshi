You are basing all of this on an imaginary incentive google will give to entice miners and users of thier coin. 
Also keep in mind Google is publically traded. I really don't see them wanting to take on this risk.  They don't want to be a bank. For example, google wallet virtual card is backed by a bank,  Bancorp Bank. They do not want to get into that regulatory environment, as it differs away from their core business, technology.

If you are using the term "miner" to represent a person or entity, then it is very easily done. Just buy or produce a bunch of ASIC devices. 
If you are using the term "miner" as a single piece of equipment, then you may be confused. The eligius address/account can be used by multiple devices. For example you can point your mining hardware to that eligius account and mine. Of course since you don't have the private keys for that address you wont see any compensation for mining to it.

Depends on how long nodes keep it, maybe 2 days. But as I said before, post the transaction here so we might see what the problem is. it's not a constant .0001 minimum. The larger the size of the transaction, the more the fee should be.

Basically, need to build awareness and trust first. Read what the overstock CEO wrote. He can't keep the bitcoins if suppliers still want fiat. We can't expect everyone to transact in btc only until we spread awareness and trust.

"although the same user claims to have gotten more double spends credited to his account since."
Your use of "double spend" terminology is incorrect. Duplicate withdrawal maybe. Seems like his system works pretty much as intended, except he was the one that caused the system to pay out after he manually sent. At least that is what I gleamed from your conversation with him. I have never even heard of this service, but on a scale of meh to oh shit, i give this a meh.

There is legislation in place that gives rules and guidelines to sale of these assets. I would think that since all of this is audited, and can be easily obtained with a FOI request from anyone, they would not want to mess around with the sale of such highly publicized assets. These rules generally don't allow government entities/employees to buy these assets.

You are wrong that AAPL has no debt. They have been issuing over 50 bil in debt and more to come since 2013 to buy back stock. Also domestically they don't have 150b in cash.

Point is in China they can seize your money for whatever reason. Wake up.

Some people would switch, some people wouldn't. Same as what happened with litecoin, dogecoin, etc came out. Then those currencies price slowed and people stopped mining those or moved back to BTC.

Yes it is a capital asset so gains should go there.
Capital Assets
Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment is a capital asset. For exceptions, see Noncapital Assets, later. 
Bitcoins are not on the exception list so it should fall under the broader definition of capital asset.
