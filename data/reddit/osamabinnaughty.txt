I have to advertise an advertising site here because there are no other advertising sites lol. I think I found a niche

TorAds (by Grams) did, but I never heard of them before doing extensive research to find the the same answer, so I'd say we could fill a large market.

Just an advertising platform for tor sites, not really important if you don't use it
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:01:07
Sorry for the late reply!
We are about to make an adjustment to the price and payout rates, I'll update you shortly :)

Ok, so previously we were asking 10 bits per view, and paying out 5 per view.
Well, we realize this is not appealing, and we could still make a profit if we lowered our % and got more users into it.
We now want to pay out 9 bits, because 10% is plenty for us.
This is becoming final as of 3am EST. :) we hope to have you as one of our first users!

In my opinion, this is my way of contributing to the Bitcoin economy on a small scale.
The reason the site looks so bad is Tor takes too long to load and most have JavaScript disabled, so I apologize for my lack of minimalistic skill.
We plan on making a clearnet advertising service using Bitcoin in the near future. We hope you enjoy!

It's just and Advertising platform for Tor sites, it uses Bitcoin only so I guess it's relevant.

I like this option, how does one use the BitcoinJ from the command line? Or as a daemon?

In case you can't see it, it is an advertising platform for Tor sites that only accepts Bitcoin, that's all.
We are making a clearnet version of it soon, but that would require a monitoring/approval system. This is a (mostly) ruleless version where you can post any ad (except for CP, we do not tolerate CP)

I just made the switch, I am setting up there with a $15 storage plan (640GB, 2GB RAM). Fucking sweet, it may be 1 core, but that's all need. Thanks man!
@_date: 2014-12-24 07:02:22
It was down for a little, our server wasn't big enough for the Bitcoin Blockchain, so we had to move.
