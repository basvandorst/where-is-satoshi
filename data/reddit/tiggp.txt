1800 btc/day for 7 billion people is not "many bitcoins"
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:30:58
If it doesn't require ID it seems a fair premium.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:48:34
But what instant payments do you use?
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:35:30
Instant? 
Don't get me wrong, I use lbc and like it but there are not many instant payment methods available with no ID.

I'm still buying my Lambo and I won't pay more than 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:19
It's still too early to cashout your crypto.
Most people started to realize just now that this world even exists 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:21
Do you have your own ass?

Welcome to the club buddy!
Been using mine everyday! 
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:53:09
Tried to open an account with cryptocapital but without success :-(
Are they still working?
Maybe it was a momentary glitch idk...
@_date: 2015-05-25 10:39:39
I sent my ID to upgrade my account 2 months ago and so far it's still processing... :-(
For the same purpose I opened an account with ING Luxembourg and it was fast and their english e-mail support is great
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:23:34
I did today and they replied fast.
They said it's ok now, and that they'll send the card.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:27:04
And paypal is well known for freezing your assets whenever they please without justification.

Because bitcoin is an alternative to gaypal
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:28:18
Never give real credit cards or bank accounts to these fuckers.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:13:26
If you really need to use gaypal give them virtual credit cards and bank accounts loaded with just enough funds to complete transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:07:47
When can we expect lower fees?
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:08:25
This is the community forum, not the account itself.
They are actively censoring anyone who dares to point out service failures.

He was lucky because the top could have been at 200k or 2M like I said. 
If it had gone to 2M he would feel pretty stupid now. It topped at 20k so his speculation was right, or in other words, was lucky.
What would btc price be at top if btc followed eth pattern? Why was that impossible or improbable? 20k was a random guess like many other random guesses.
But if you think you know better I have a challenge for anyone willing to accept it.
Post here what the price will be in 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Just that. 3 very scientific and very educated estimates! And then we talk.
Who's up to it?

It's a shame to see what Revolut has become.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:43:19
You are not focusing on my point.
I'll put it simpler. Compare BTC and ETH. What's fundamentally different?
Why did ETH rise +7000% in the last year and BTC only +600%?
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:19:30


Interesting perspective. Where did you see that?
I already read Thinking, Fast and Slow.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:59:58


Risk of meeting people?
You really need to get off that cave eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:25:22
Enough internet for the day...
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:06:03
It was a joke. I also still use banks.
Btw, you seem to use a very good bank. Most banks have fees.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:32
You think and you did good if you sold and that made you happy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:14:56


Why? Where is that golden rule written?
The truth is that there are no rule. Ethereum had a much steeper rise and other alts even more. 
Did you also predict that or you sold when it quadrupled?
You are free to cashout whenever you feel comfortable but please don't pretend you know better than everybody else just because you were lucky with the timing.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT!
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:56:02


They can't rob more than a bank, can they?
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:17:24
Relax! I know you left that cave at least twice.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:06:15
And how did you know that the top of the race was 20k and not 200k or 2M? 
If you really did what you said you were just lucky, nothing else. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:06:42
What do you suggest?
