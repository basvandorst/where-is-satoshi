That's just to further validate your username (screen-name) which is called a "handle" and why it says that. 
It doesn't have anything to do with the actual server. To put it on a server you want to install it just as you would normally on any computer then go to the advanced tab. From the advanced (same tab the resolver is on), 2nd from the bottom are the server settings. Click "Change" to setup the server parameters. These should already be set for whatever system you install the client on. 
Once it is running on the server however, this is where you can configure your client to point to your server to administer your profile, settings, store, etc... What I mean by that is when you install Openbazaar on your laptop for instance but want to point your client (the openbazaar software) to your server, you would put the servers parameters in these settings. (eg. IP address, ports, etc...).
That make sense?

There is a fee with Circle its just better hidden. For example the "no fee" cost at circle currently is $447.95 whereas the Coinbase cost is $443.38. Total cost of Circle comes to $447.95 and Coinbase ends up around 460. Which means there is less than a ½% difference between the two.
Both base prices are higher than the index (which at the time was $442).

Under the new amendments (effective Jan 1st 2016)
    VII. "Convertible virtual currency'' means a digital representation of value that: 
       (a) Can be a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value; 
       (b) Has an equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for real currency; 
       (c) May be centralized or decentralized; and 
       (d) Can be exchanged for currency or other convertible virtual currency. 
    XV. "Monetary value'' means a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in currency, and includes convertible virtual currency.
    XVI. "Money transmission'' means: 
       (b) Receiving currency or monetary value for transmission to another location. 
Scroll to the second portion, the first expires on 1/1/2015. The second definitions sections under title [RSA 399-G:1 effective January 1, 2016; see also RSA 399-G:1 set out above.] as 399-G:1 Definitions. -- go into effect 1-1-2016.

On average it's about a $10 to $25 transaction, that taked about 30 minutes to walk someone thought the process and explain shit. 
That individual is usually on a cell phone with absolutely no clue of what bitcoin is or how it works, with little to no technical skills, generally in a bad mood already, and freaking out because they need bitcoin an hour ago which has pushed them to the point of shooting the next person they see because they won't be able to feed their kids tomorrow if they don't get the transaction completed ASAP.

On this forum, you are likely right  but it propagates to other areas of the web where those not yet as knowledgeable as yourself, may fall victim.
 is exactly correct. Case in point, this very site nearly scammed a colleague of mine until I pointed out the reasons it's suspect, and he's been dealing and trading bitcoin for a few months now. There are new people coming into the industry everyday that have no clue, so we all have to help them get up to speed on these types of scams. 
Luckily he asked before trying it out, so I won't tell him you called him stupid. ;)  
The site looks fairly well made and legit at first. The minimum is low at 0.01 and my guess is that is the actual scam. 
They are likely not even trying to Ponzi, but just outright steal by persuading people into a "well it's only 0.01, doesn't hurt to try" mentality. That and what wtfcode2 said, as well. 
Then they up and slither away with the stolen coin, and no one bothers to chase a few bits.
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:26:58

It's tricky the way the this is amended. It is best explained in the article which covers this in detail from a legal perspective, so I would recommend reading it there instead of me trying to explain it. In a nutshell, they place virtual currency (bitcoin) in a classification of what is considered money transmission by amending the definition of monetary value without changing the money transmission laws or explicitly stating anything specifically. 
In other words, they shoved a square peg into a round hole. Beyond that I would recommend reading the article in detail as it covers this in depth.
@_date: 2015-12-10 13:02:24
This is explained more in-depth in the subsequent article: 
I don't think that one got posted on Reddit, but it has a bit more detail.
You are exactly correct in your assessment and that is the loophole they are closing. What New Hampshire's regulation states is that "money transmission" means sending "money" or "monetary value" and that is not what is changing to reflect digital currency. It's wording is specifically: "Receiving currency or monetary value for transmission to another location". That's one of the reasons nobody had really heard about this. It still says something similar. This is at 399-G:1 (VIII).
What DID change was the definition of "monetary value". It read: ""Monetary value'' means a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in money.", and hence the loophole. Bitcoin is not money, and its not monetary value. 
On January 1st, THIS is what goes into effect: " 'Monetary value' means a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in currency, **and includes convertible virtual currency.**"
They were slick about this too, kept it very quiet, made it hard to see even when visiting the published regulation (buried it at the end), and managed to change the definition to make it work without making it apparent in the "money transmission" terms themselves, which they also changed, by the way, so at a glance it looks like there is nothing to worry about. Previously the definition of "monetary value" was at 399-G:1(VII), and NOW it's at 399-G:1(XV), another curve ball.
Residents in New Hampshire who KNEW about the bill (HB 666) earlier this year and had NO IDEA it had passed.
I encourage you to give the newer article a read, it explains this better than I can here and I don't want to state anything inaccurately since regulations can be complex. It's here: 
Hope that helps.

Actually it's US and Canada that seem most active. 
There is some overlap with LBC, but yes, very different. The buyer just sees a button "Pay with Paxful" just like "Paypal" or "Visa" on whatever marketplace it's installed. Then they go into a LBC-ish landscape but it's very different too. 
I think it is mainly the additional support, I can't see any of the buyers on there fitting into the LBC model really. That would be like throwing a steak into the lions den. I know in the beginning they only allowed a small group of traders (legacy traders they are called on there) to sell for this very reason and they all conglomerate on a separate live channel.
Yes, it's allot of work in comparison to LBC and likely why not many LBC traders trade over there. Allot came and signed up, but left after the onslaught of customer support that was required. From what I have noticed, almost all of the volume traders there are actually companies or trade coins full-time for a living so perhaps the extra support is handled with staff.

I think there is misconception when reading the statues at 399-G:1. New Hampshire's presentation is misleading in that the current regulation appears at the top of the page, whereas the amendments effective 1-1-2016 are at the bottom of the page making it appear as if this is article is inaccurate. 
However, upon review of the actual amendments (located as described above), you can see that this is in fact going to go into effect on January 1st.

Note that this is in regards to selling bitcoin only, buying or using bitcoin for purchasing goods and services is still allowed. Only the sale, which includes personal sales, is prohibited under the new regulations. 
The provisions at 366-G:4 still allow gift cards as well.
There are no provisions, however, for the personal sale of bitcoin as an exemption, meaning that selling any amount of bitcoin on a individual personal basis may also be considered an illegal activity under the new regulations at 399-G:1 which include virtual currency in its definition of monetary value of which the transmission of money is considered in the State of New Hampshire. The amendments go into effect on January 1st, 2016.
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:55:05
Not exactly, by definition they would be more accurately redefining the value of an asset. However for their intents and purposes, they are sneaking regulation of bitcoin in the back door by these definitions without amending the money transmission law explicitly. I say "they" but I should say the one person responsible, which would be Laura Jones. She, and she alone, sponsored house bill 666 from which this regulation originated.
Whereas the sale of digital without a money transmitters license will be illegal under the amendment, the title is accurate. There's not enough room to write a paragraph specifically stating every detail of the subject matter. However, in all fairness "Unlicensed bitcoin sales" would likely have been a more definitive title, but the current title is not inaccurate. 
What they are specifically doing is defining virtual currency, and redefining "monetary value" to include the definition of "virtual currency", subsequently including virtual currency in the existing money transmitter law which requires a license as it is defined as activity that involves money or monetary value. What they are not doing is providing a provision to exempt personal sales of bitcoin.

Well here on planet Earth a direct trans-lunar injection from the surface is not feasible and would be inefficient anyway. This is why we do this from the parking orbit where you not only get more bang for the buck (literally), but you never actually leave earths orbit, rather you enter an elliptical orbit intersecting the moons for lunar insertion. We do the same same shit on the way back. 
It's *all* about the gravity.
Nice analogy, although I would propose "borrow" rather than "steal", it's more like a 3rd party loan since the planet borrowed it from the Sun in the first place and when you're done with it another borrower will come along. However, I'm sure the planet itself would certainly claim it was "stolen". LOL

Actually that is inaccurate. Every example of 13K you presented is *not* "OK". In each case each industry has to file as well. In fact the filing requirements of non-MSB entities is actually much worse and more detailed covering more things like money orders and cashiers checks. Registered MSB's are exempt from certain copious reporting requirements as well as the aggregates beyond 24 hours whereas non-MSB have more detailed reporting to worry about and up to 12 months of aggregates. In the real estate industry for example, if a tenant pays cash of 1K per month for rent, then on the 11th month the landlord has to file a report as a single 11K transaction.
In every example the failure to file a report would result in trouble equally the same, the MSB would just have an easier quicker report to file.
In the Bob/Alice example it (edit 1) would depend on the state and the money transmission laws but typically a report would be filed if it were a normal vendor, an MSB may not need to report the bitcoin transaction, but both would need to file the cash transaction. 
On (edit 2) it wouldn't matter since there was a cash transaction involved. It would all need to be reported. However, the aggregate timespan between transactions for MSB's is 24 hours or 1 business day (24 hours for bitcoin). Non-MSB company's such as a used car lot or jewelry store have to report aggregates of up to 12 months. 
What's worse for the non-MSB company is that they additionally have to provide statements to their customers for each report filed at the end of the year. MSB's also are exempt there as well.
You basically damn if you do, damn if you don't, but that extra charge is brutal and ridiculous in the way its used sometimes, this being a perfect example of that. 
As far as that charge, there is some explanation on the "unlawful money transmission" part here:

**We're suppose to believe this horseshit? Give me a fucking break.**
What idiot hacker who had 6 million bucks (which would undoubtedly be elsewhere by now) that was stolen **over a year ago** and **never reported** and whom the wizards at Crypsy admitted they **could not locate,** *suddenly* has a change of heart and gives back 87% of the money at risk of imprisonment.

very good analogy and cafe would be doing *slightly* better without  the additional overhead, but capacity is cheap, however using your same example and lets say cafe can take 2*capacity of cafe
coffee adoption doubles, both cafe's are "bursting at the seams". cafe  is doing better. cafe  experiences no change since adopters must use cafe  if they want coffee or wait longer. 
coffee adoption triples, both cafe's are "bursting at the seams". cafe  is doing better. neither cafe experiences change but people are left without coffee and waiting but with a better chance to get coffee at cafe  more people obvious try there. 
cafe doubles its ability to serve more customers, cafe  does nothing. now cafe has no lines, no people waiting. cafe  is still "bursting at the seems" but adoption for cafe  no longer occurs since there is no ability to serve anymore customers than it already does. cafe is doing better, but only slightly since the increased capacity hurts a bit
**the price of coffee and the difficulty to make coffee both go up**
cafe  and cafe  must decrease capacity by 25% to maintain the ability to produce coffee efficiently and both raise prices. 
cafe experiences no change other than decreased capacity. cafe is now doing worse than itself when it originally started and the bleeding begins
repeat this process over time, eventually there is no more cafe unless it increases capacity
or at any given time starbucks comes in and gobbles 50% of the marketshare ... cafe  can't survive ...  and enjoys a quick death rather than the aforementioned slow one ... cafe  struggles at first but sticks to its model and ultimately lives since it was very strong to begin with

You created a bunch of accounts on LBC, one of those accounts has a charged back of which you just didn't bother to pay back. You've gone all over forums calling LBC names and talking shit. You're account has been banned.  
ALL things you yourself admitted doing.
Now you're over **here** crying about it trying to cause trouble with yet **another** brand new account. You lost your 1.3 bitcoin because you're either a scammer or an idiot. Maybe both. 
Stop scamming people and stop doing stupid shit and your life will improve.

Yes, at your normal income tax rate if you realize the gain within a year. If you hold for 365+ days before you realize the gain , then that is considered a long-term investment and the tax bracket goes down to 15%-20% depending on your income tax bracket, if you bracket is under 15% you may qualify for 0% on gains.

1. This merely proposes micro-payments not being as important to be in support of a block-size increase and does not address the fundamental issue of the problem. if large transactions equate to a capacity great than that of the block capacity itself even without micro-payments, the issue remains. secondly this happens already with low fee or free transactions (micropayments) so this really doesn't make allot of sense. miners can kick micropayments way down the road if they so choose to by way of configuration.. many do this already to prevent spam and floods
2. well put and nice use of "*champagne problem*" as this certainly falls under a "nice problem to have".. however, just one addition, panic-selling generally comes from bad press in the mainstream media... for example: what just happened ... nobody who pays any attention to what's actually going on *panic-sold* ... in fact many panic bought ... the panic being that they weren't going to be able to enjoy buying at lower prices for long .. as you can see, they had a small window .. its those outside of this that see bullshit in the mainstream media and freak-out that did the panic-selling ... just an additional two cents to what you already stated.

Not really. 
Instead, you would take the new bitcoin and add: 1 part bitcoin, 100 parts wallet. Split 1 bitcoin between wallets 1-10. Add **new** bitcoin to wallets 1-10 (split unequally). Send random amounts of wallets 1-10 to 11-20, then again 21-30, then again 31-40, the combine 2 wallets randomly from wallets 31-40 into a random wallet from 41-50, and split the other 31-40 into the remain 9 wallets of 41-50, then from 41-50 take do this for 2 wallets then 8 for 51-60, 4 for 61-70, then combine 5 randoms into 1 of the 71-80, and the other 5 into another 71-80,  then coming both into 1 random wallet of 81-90, and then finish it by send 1 of the 2 bitcoins in the new wallet into a random wallet from 91-100. There is the new bitcoin.
But do this on a much bigger scale, with more random patterns, and with lots of other bitcoins.
That would be hard to track, but still ... not impossible.

You'll need to get the raw hex from the transaction itself, then you can append fees and rebroadcast the transaction. if the other transaction ever does send, it'll just be seen as a double-spend and error out. The easiest way to do this is to use a 3rd party tool that allows you to append fees. You can get the RAW hex from several sites as well if you are not familiar with how to do that.
For example, you can use blockchain.info to view the transaction by TXID. Then take that URL and add: **?format=hex** to the end of it.
You end up with: 
 
Then take that raw hex and rebroadcast the transaction or use a 3rd parry tool for this, there are several out there. Remember to add fees.
Hold that helps.

Agreed. 
Just a note, the "conservative" statement was in the comparison of other service offerings (scams) promising a ridiculous 100%, 200%, 1000%, or similar excessive return of no probability. 
These scams are getting slicker and more deceitful making it difficult to explain the fraudulent nature of them to many. To an average person looking to make a nominal investment, it sounds within the realm of possibility. Although as you stated, highly improbable. Additionally any statement insinuating complete absence of risk in a commodities trading investment is a absolute fabrication of the truth.
Despite efforts to call these out, sites like this one are difficult to expose due to their realistic appearance. Everything is setup and said just well enough to cast doubt on the actual fact that it is a scam.

In addition to the $100 being a bit for an average Joe to flush down the financial toilet, that only equates to 25MM ... a normal bank needs at that just to get the door open. Yet, these guys expect to launch globally and go where no bank has gone before on what 100+ banks couldn't do last year in a single location and normal conservative banking?
Bad investment? Likely. Realistically achievable concept? Not so sure.

Ever hear the term "quit while you are ahead"? You've just proved yourself a fraud several times over.
Instead of going through all of this pathetic dribble, I simply leave you with a couple things disproving your entire scheme before you get yourself thrown in jail. You can thank me later.
What the Vanuatu regulation actually states is that it is a $500,000 minimum. Not the total, it is the minimum. They base the total capitol requirement on many things such as risk, type of banking services, experience of the controllers (of which only you are so it will all be base on you), etc... You are "supposedly" offering the most risky of the known financial services on earth. Not one or two, ALL OF THEM. Do you know what your capitol requirement is going to be? Possibly millions.
This is assuming you can even qualify. One of the prerequisites for this license is experience (they generally like to see 10 years) of which you have absolutely none. 
Secondly, the length of time for this to possibly come to fruition is going to be 4 to 6 months. It's going to take you at least 6 to 8 weeks to get the mountain of necessary paperwork in place and delivered with all of the trimmings that go along with it and then Vanuatu has 4 months to conduct their review before they ultimately decline. This of course, is after the million is obtained, of which you not only have to secure the $500,000, but the additional fees of about $24,000 for other required registrations and license fees. 
So this pipe dream of a license by December as you have claimed is not even possible.
This is, of course, is not to mention the legal and setup fees. You've spent 10% of your total budget that you don't even have yet and you have been open for 5 days. Yes, we also know that too. You weren't even a business a week ago. NB Formation registered on October 23rd, 2015. Would you like me to show you the registration documents from the Vanuatu government? At least you spelled your name correctly there, which you conveniently got wrong on a press blast but manage to spell it correctly everywhere else on everything you signed since 2009.
To be nice, we withheld allot, for everything that was stated in the article, there are 5 things that were not stated. This is because we do not make baseless claims, we spend copious amounts of time and resources looking into claims before blowing the whistle. All of which goes to show you are either perpetrating a scam or you are so foolish that you actually do not realize how badly this would fail and blow up in your face if it ever made it past tomorrow. So either way, we are doing you a favor.
My advice. Give any money back that you received and forget this entire thing before you land yourself in real trouble. 
You are welcome.
Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 03:05:21
It was a press release, so only the PR firm is paid. The news outlets merely pass it along "as-is". 
In this particular case, even with validation of the source and content, it was coming from a PR firm and the company actually does exist in Vanuatu who hosts many banks and financial services. So it actually looks legit on the surface.
The original press release came from PR News Wire ( which is not industry-specific.

Whereas I obviously agree its a joke, it's still not something to take lightly. "michelhacker" should count his lucky fucking stars because had the arresting officers possessed an actual clue about the laws they were attempting to enforce, they would have done things just slightly differently and he'd have been in deep shit. Another purchase for just a few hundred dollars would have resulted in a drastically different outcome. He got **extraordinarily** lucky he was arrested by a bunch of idiots.
The real joke here is that a DA would even pick up this case since they should have known this would be thrown out. Then again where there's a public fucking defender you find the same flavor of public prosecutor. This judge didn't make any "groundbreaking" rulings either, it was more a lack of options and below anything that could remotely be considered any form of laundering. Had she ruled otherwise they would have appealed and won and she'd look like a fool which is never attractive on a resume. Trust me, this was self serving for the Judge. Unlike the rest of the clan involved, she's obviously *not* an idiot.
This was more like getting a speeding ticket for going 7 miles over the speed limit. Technically illegal but _not quite_ illegal enough to be considered actually illegal.
