I published an extensive essay yesterday about the four stages of Bitcoin evolution, where we've come from and where we are headed. It may be helpful to you.

thanks for pointing out the typo. fixed.
very much agree bitcoin is always evolving. thanks for sharing your thoughts.

Hi. You've got it mostly right. You can also read our whitepaper here 
1/ The 'cloud' key is the user key encrypted with the strong passcode. BitGo never sees the unencrypted key nor the passcode. We just store it in the cloud for convenience. No one can do anything with the cloud key unless they know your passcode.
2/ For the most basic of consumer wallets, two keys are created in the browser. We use advanced security protection like Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks and so forth. But if you want the utmost security, then you can create your own cold key offline and just give us the public key during wallet creation. Then you are completely safe and still have ownership of 2 keys in case you need to access your holdings without BitGo. For enterprise customers, this is a best practice we recommend every time.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:19:57
Good question. There are a number of mechanisms in place to mitigate this risk: 1/ we have open-sourced much or all of our client-side code (where the 2nd key is created) so you can audit it yourself; 2/ we put our system through a rigorous security audit; and 3/ we have procedures in place to prevent foreign code from entering production. Our key generation is best-in-class, uses robust open-source libraries where appropriate and then takes additional measures like key-stretching to ensure the utmost security. Lastly, we allow you to bring your own backup key to the consumer wallet, and enterprise customers can bring two keys to the wallet if needed.

give [BitGo]( a try. It offers a multi-signature wallet and 2-factor auth for maximum security while still accessible online.

Hi. I definitely hear your concern. If you look at our bios, we aren't patent trolls. We are veteran startup guys who are very passionate about growing the Bitcoin ecosystem; so the last thing we would want to do is make it more difficult with patents. For example, Mike (BitGo's CTO) co-invented SPDY while at Google and made sure all of those patents were made public domain to those interested in moving open-source forward. BitGo's patent protection is for some of our internal tech and has value for defensive purposes.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:40:24
Really? You should see the BitGo homepage describing the multi-signature wallet, along with a sign up and login button. We've never heard of this issue before. Can you try again?
@_date: 2014-04-22 02:21:38
Hi- thanks for being a BitGo customer! 
We are first introducing spending limits and approval chains with [BitGo Enterprise]( which we announced earlier this month, and plan to roll out some of these protections for the consumer wallet. Stay tuned and feel free to email us at support if you have any suggestions.

Actually, exchanges can operate without holding a central pool of bitcoin. With multi-sig, an exchange could be designed such that every user has a 2-of-3 key wallet and the exchange has a single key. That way the exchange has a right to transact on that wallet, according to predetermined business rules, but if the exchange gets hacked or taken down, the users' funds won't be lost. There are several next generation exchanges pursuing this model, some on top of the BitGo API.
Your point about the time between blocks is correct, but that means that an exchange only needs to hold a centralized float for 10 minute intervals, not permanently.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:38:28
Hi. Thanks again, I appreciate it. 
On pricing: our BitGo Secure Wallet is free for consumers. We charge for business solutions that allow corporations and financial institutions to manage their Bitcoin holdings. Organizations need more advanced functionality like multiple signers, key management, and so on. We will be publishing that pricing and product suite in the near future.

Thanks for using BitGo! Sending to P2SH addresses like BitGo is widely supported by the top wallets in the ecosystem, including Blockchain.info and others. We have published guides for how to send BTC from any wallet you can read here 
If your wallet does not support sending to a P2SH address (addresses that start with a "3"), you can import a single private key account into BitGo - follow this [guide]( and then transfer from that account to your BitGo multi-sig secure wallet. This may be a useful workaround for your case.
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:52:47
Interesting point about the size of the redeeming scripts. Don't you think that is solvable or otherwise a worthwhile expense for the security?
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:08:38
Have you tried [BitGo]( BitGo has a multi-sig wallet built on P2SH. 3 keys issued, 2 required to sign any transaction. One key is stored with BitGo, one with the user, and one offline. Security of multi-sig with the ease of use of online/mobile access.
We've published a whitepaper on our tech and open-sourced a lot of components. Our tech was built by a team compiled of veterans in online security and digital currency. 
Please give BitGo a try and let us know what you think!

I think the industry is poised for a divide between blockchain security, or as Andreas put it "[Trust by computation]( and man-made security.
This leads to a natural ethos division of "the user hold the coins" vs "a service holds the coins".
I think the core Bitcoin community is squarely in the first camp: the user should holds the coins. And, as you point out, there are wallets available today that allow for this, with [BitGo]( being the most secure, online, multi-sig option.
There are also wallets and exchanges in the second camp, including MtGox and the exchanges that were hacked.
We still have yet to face a test of adoption. Users are familiar with FDIC insurance, 4-digit pins, call centers, and so on. Will they want to take on more serious security measures like strong passwords and encrypted private keys, or the learning curve of understanding what the blockchain is, what mining is, and even more advanced concepts.
The services that will win are the ones that stay true to decentralized, blockchain security, while hiding the complexity of this security from the user and bridging the existing financial service paradigms.

Single key on paper wallet + camera = theft. This happened to a [Bloomberg reporter]( Of course, an exchange would be more careful, but single key = theft risk. If you have multiple keys held by multiple parties, the risk is much much lower, maybe near zero.
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:37:36
Thank you. Let us know if you have any additional feedback. founders
@_date: 2014-04-26 05:40:05
Thanks for raising this question. The whitepaper you read (thanks for reading) is from August 2013 when we first launched this wallet. We are actually moving BitGo entirely to HD wallets (BIP32) for the reasons you reference. BitGo is a finished product and fully safe, and by adding BIP32 we will enhance privacy.
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:52:51
Thank you for helping to clarify this. You are absolutely right. BitGo only ever sees 1 key, generated on the server and stored securely. BitGo never sees the unencrypted user key or backup key, nor the user's passcode. A user can even bring their own cold key.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:45:25
Why would you want to do that?
@_date: 2014-04-06 16:01:20
Yes, these scenarios are absolutely possible with multi-sig. At BitGo we have built a multi-sig platform that allows for multiple signers within an organization, spending limits with approval chains, and other corporate treasury capabilities. BitGo acts as an authentication layer and co-signer. The business or financial institution sets the rules about who can sign and what the limits are. You can try the consumer multi-sig wallet at  or contact us if you are interested in the business solution. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:12:09
Thanks for the support! We love to hear from happy customers. Keep sending us your feedback.

Ok thanks. Two responses: 
1/ We do have an API that these other wallets can use. The two you mention are not using the API as of now.
2/ As a user, you could link your Blockchain address in the BitGo dashboard and then watch your holdings on BitGo, getting the benefits of 24x7 monitoring and alerts. This means you can keep your Bitcoin with your preferred wallet but see your total holdings on the BitGo dashboard. You can link Blockchain, Coinbase, and even cold storage.

[bitgo.com]( - fully operational multi-sig wallet using 2-of-3 p2sh. give it a try.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:27:53
Thanks for the feedback. It was important to us to work within standards and not be a "custom wallet". We use a standard P2SH address (BIP 16), so that means you can use any wallet software to send bitcoins to that address. We also have open-source tech that allows you to send bitcoins from your P2SH address in case BitGo ever goes away. That way, you're never locked into BitGo by any means.
We also have an API that other wallets and exchanges can use if they want to build their platform on top of our secure multi-sig.
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:45:03
If you have not checked out [BitGo]( please give it a look. It's the world's first multi-signature wallet invented by a former member of the founding team of Google Chrome.
3 keys are issued to a wallet and any 2 are needed to sign a transaction. 1 key is held by BitGo, 1 controlled by the user, and a 3rd held offline with a trusted party. This means you can use BitGo as a secure web wallet but you have a backup plan with your other 2 keys for the event BitGo goes away. Industry best practices for 2-factor auth and strong passwords are followed.
Read about how BitGo works at [company.bitgo.com]( and get a free wallet at [bitgo.com]( We've secured tens of millions of $ and strongly believe it is the most secure way to store Bitcoin. We'd love to hear your thoughts.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:33:19
Hi- Will from BitGo here. Here is how it works.
Each wallet is created with 3 keys. The first key (BitGo key) is created on our server and stored by BitGo. The second key (user key) is generated in your browser in Javascript using maximal entropy, encrypted with a passcode only known to you, and then stored in the cloud like Blockchain.info's single key. The third key (backup key) can be generated in the browser or you can bring your own cold key. At the time of wallet creation, we ask you to print the user key and backup key and a redemption script, or you can email yourself an encrypted PDF with that info. If BitGo is ever unavailable, you can use that piece of paper and open-source software to send your bitcoins somewhere else. Otherwise, for normal use, to send a transaction you simply login to BitGo and sign with the user key. Each time you sign with the user key, it is downloaded from the cloud, you decrypt it with your passcode, and you sign it in the browser. We authenticate who you are and apply business rules like fraud detection and spending limits, and then co-sign the transaction and send to the blockchain.
We never see:
* your user key
* you backup key
* your passcode
Therefore, we only have 1 key in our possession (the BitGo key) and we do not have enough information to access your holdings. We remove the complexity of remembering or pasting your actual user key by using a passcode to encrypt it, but we never see the key or your passcode.
Hope this helps. Email us support with more questions. Thanks for using BitGo!
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:52:14
We also use 2-factor for every transaction.

Hi, you'll want to keep your Bitcoin safe. Create a free secure wallet at [BitGo]( For the non newbies, it's the first multi-sig, online wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:43:00
This is up to the exchange. Low-frequency, large block transactions are not a problem. 
For high-frequency trades, there are two ways to go about it: 
1/ the user could hold 2 keys, and the exchange would take on the temporary liquidity risk and "cover" open trades. It's not unlike other capital markets - stocks, derivatives, what have you. Traders accept orders and continue trading, then the runner takes the ticket and it's printed later. In the same way, for a Bitcoin exchange, the trader fraud risk is limited to current open orders rather than the total funds an exchange has access to and a trader who commits fraud could be punished.
2/ the user could be limited to having one key and the backup key would be with a custodian. there would be a protocol for the user to get the backup key in case the exchange went away, but it would involve human intervention and documentation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:46:34
Thanks! That's exactly right. BitGo never directly accesses or holds your Bitcoin. Companies interested in our API to build their own services on top of our multi-sig platform, please contact us.

It is safe. The key generated in the browser is done in Javascript using extensive security policies like CSP to prevent XSS attacks and so forth. That key is encrypted with a passcode only known to the user in the browser. BitGo never sees that key nor the passcode. You can audit our client-side source code on github.com/bitgo and we have performed independent security audits.
@_date: 2014-03-11 14:40:31
Yes we do! This is especially important for businesses. We will let users set spending limits on a per transaction and daily basis, and establish approval chains for when those limits are breached. Stay tuned for us announcing this functionality. If you have ideas or questions, email us at founders

@_date: 2014-03-21 21:06:01
I'm not sure I follow your comment. If you mean that there could be race conditions, that could be solved by creating a multi-sig escrow address for every trade and setting rules about key distribution only once the trade clears.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:21:27
Hi- I hear your concerns. A couple of comments. 
1/ Our CTO/co-founder Mike Belshe was on the founding team of Google Chrome and is an expert in browser security. We are using the absolute highest standards of security in generation and transmission of data.
2/ Our whitepaper  explains how keys are generated and brought together. In summary, one key is generated server-side by BitGo and stored securely. The second key (user key) is generated client-side, encrypted with a strong passcode the user creates and then that encrypted key - which is useless to anyone else - is stored in the cloud for ease of use. The third key (backup key) can be generated in the browser and printed (never uploaded) or you can generate your own "cold key" and give us the public key. This guarantees that 3 keys were generated by 3 different parties on 3 different systems, and so there is not a chance for an attacker to steal 2 keys.
Thanks for trying out BitGo!

Thanks for using BitGo! I think we can address all of your questions and wishlist today.
We do have a BitGo Enterprise Basic tier for $19.99 per month. Sign up at [bitgo.com/enterprise]( or email sales
We have also upgraded our processes and tools for generating the 2 keys you maintain (one operational key and one cold key). With one cold key, BitGo is a great and safe alternative to single-key cold storage.
We do have a video explaining how to create a secure wallet with an offline Backup Key. 
All of our wallets are HD so your addresses automatically change on every transaction.

Hi there-
To clarify, BitGo only holds 1 private key of 3. You have control of the other 2 keys. We have no independent authority or ability to transact on your wallet. If BitGo is unavailable, you can use the other 2 keys to transact directly on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:16:28
Also, 100% on blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:37:32
Hi. Thanks for sharing but your answer is inaccurate. Please see my other response on this thread. BitGo only ever sees 1 of 3 keys. The 2nd key is always generated on the client side and encrypted by the user. It is not derived from the passcode, it is encrypted with the passcode. Important distinction.
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:46:31
The wallet is fully operational and we have secured a lot of bitcoin. If you need help getting started, check out our step by step guides and FAQ.

On April 7, OpenSSL, the dominant library used to implement secure network communication on the Internet disclosed a vulnerability which impacted approximately 66% of the internet, including BitGo servers.  The vulnerability has been given the name “heartbleed”, because it exploits a bug in the heartbeat mechanism of the TLS protocol, and “bleeds” random information out of the server.   Less than 24 hours later, a fix for that problem was deployed to BitGo and BitGo customers are safe.
We want to take this opportunity to talk about the importance of TLS server configuration at BitGo and how we take it seriously.
Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
First of all, all data communications with BitGo servers utilizes an optional feature of modern web browsers: Strict Transport Security.  This simple feature tells your browser that you should always connect to BitGo using TLS for encrypted communications. There is no way to accidentally connect to BitGo using HTTP.  You can read more about how STS works at Mozilla.
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
A less commonly used feature of TLS is that of Perfect Forward Secrecy, which BitGo has enabled for some time.  Imagine if an entity decided to record all encrypted traffic to a particular site.  Because we use TLS, all of that traffic is encrypted, and the entity cannot read it.  But what if that entity was able to learn the server key in the future?  Would it be able to go back in time and decrypt the past communications?  Prior to use of PFS, it could.  But thanks to PFS, they can’t.  You can read more about how PFS works here.  Or you can read more about which sites use PFS today at Netcraft.
An A+ Report Card
One site which we love at BitGo is Qualsys’ SSL Labs.  SSL Labs provide wonderful tools for evaluating a site’s TLS configuration and helping educate users and system administrators to maximally secure their TLS.  And it’s all free!  BitGo receives an A+ Report Card.
Additional Precautions
We don’t believe any attacks were attempted against BitGo servers.  Due to the nature of this bug, however, we are taking precautions anyway.   Fortunately, BitGo’s TLS servers are isolated from BitGo’s core service in such a way that your Bitcoin keys were never exposed to the TLS server in any form.  There is no chance that any bitcoin keys could have been stolen. As a further precaution, as of this writing, BitGo has deployed new certificates to all of its servers.
If you have any questions about BitGo’s security policies or if you have any suggestions for improvement, please don’t hesitate to contact us at security

Hi. This is Will O'Brien, CEO of [BitGo](
Here's a great backgrounder on multi-sig that my co-founder Ben Davenport wrote recently. 
The easiest analogy for multi-sig is the digital equivalent of a safe deposit box where two people each need to bring a key to open the box. With multi-sig, you need multiple keys, multiple people, or even multiple institutions to sign a blockchain transaction.
Bitstamp replaced their hot wallet with a BitGo Platform API integration. Now BitGo holds a key, Bitstamp holds a key, and there is a third key offline for disaster recovery. Every transaction is signed by Bitstamp and then co-signed by BitGo once a set of fraud detection and business rules are checked. If there is ever an attack that compromises Bitstamp, BitGo will stop co-signing, thwarting the attack.
Multi-sig is without a doubt a better security model than single-key cold storage + single key hot wallet -- the predominant model in past years -- we are thrilled to see Bitstamp lead the way in adopting this important technology.

Hi, this is Will O'Brien, CEO of [BitGo](
You absolutely can, and should, use 3 keys that are generated on 3 different devices. For our enterprise customers, we go a step further and require that each key is generated and stored by a different person or organization.
In summary, a 2-of-3 key p2sh wallet is comprised of:
* BitGo key: generated and stored on BitGo's key server
* Operational key: generated by customer when creating a wallet and stored encrypted in the cloud or offline
* Cold backup key: generated offline by a chief security officer, custodian, or other provider. Only the xpub is presented to the wallet.
