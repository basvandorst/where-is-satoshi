Use a crypto to crypto exchange, btc to ltc on 1 exchange then ltc to btc on another. Black hole
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:56:59
Let them come then. Do what you can to boycott the state and its people. This is a New York problem, not a bitcoin or internet one.

I don't want to waste my water in such a way. I have gallons and gallons of clean drinking water as I was raised to prepare for emergencies such as earthquakes etc.  If I buy a gallon of water($.69 at the 99 Cent Store), it sits somewhere safe for that reason.

There's no negotiating with terrorists. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:30:33
I need this in my life
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:55:28
You explicitly ask the user, it doesnt matter what vpn they use.  Let the goons come after you. Boycott new york and new york bitcoin users. Fuck their authoritarian bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:59:44
So what? Seriously so fucking what? It's also the center of wall scams and assholes rigging the market to make their bank accounts fatter. Fuck them they can not have bitcoin then if they want to br authoritarians with every little thing.
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:53:13
They can just ask, are you from NY? If yes no account. They cant be held accountable for NY citizens lying on a straight up question. That would never ever stand in any court ever.

if I had my own 3d printer I would have access for the file :) I'd rather have this one though.
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:48:31
I'll gladly pay for shipping :) PM me here or contact me on twitter 
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:00:32
How about we just boycott New York?  Dont do business with NY bitcoin businesses and bitcoin businesses outside of New York dont allow users from NY. Stop being such bitches. All you want is their money, fuck their money.  They dont bring value or legitimacy.  Bitcoin has proven year after year it doesnt need to work with the any institutions or even States to keep chugging along.  For the Statists here who just need regulation, go start your own fucking coin stop trying to steal value and wealth from those who are choosing to optout from your coercive violence.

good find, I may have to buy this tshirt!
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:16:34
haha and myself have done the  we live in California and don't want to waste water!
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:46:59
Who cares, throw the notices away.  It's nothing more than an extortion letter and terrorists are not to be negotiated with.  Honestly boycott new york. It is unreasonable to hold businesses accountable for lying users. If New York wants to punish someone they should punish their citizens that ignore these regs. No amount of begging is going to change the State. Only rebellion and revolution will. That's exactly what Bitcoin is a rebellion, a revolution. To weak yo see it through, then leave. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:43:58
doh I had just sent him a payment as we were dealing in PM, but I'll shoot some via changetip so everyone can see :)

brilliant

So just ask all new users, are you from new york? If they answe yes " sorry no users from new york are allowed, contact your governor"
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:28:37
incompetence has worked its way into bitcoin in the past, I hope it doesn't find its way into it again in the future.
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:15:10
You won't see me disagree with you here. I think all of these places should stop using as much water as they can. Though as an individual, I can only act individually so I do what I can to cut back.  Lead by example etc etc, if others don't want to follow. That's fine I've already been planning an exit.  I am not here to defend the Governments actions, I'm just here to let people know we're using way to much water in Southern California.
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:06:13
You're most likely right, CA has other issues with regards to power production and consumption.  For instance people want to shut down back up plants that are currently running because San Onofre went down.  Again, I'm not arguing FOR the Government here. I am anti-State, I am just trying to reach out to individuals to act individually. I too think that these corporations given a pass by the ruling Governments to exploit the water supply while hampering down on the individual is bullshit.
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:03:30
Agreed. Let them come with their guns. Terrorism is by definition the use of violence towards a political end, so let them terrorize their political opponents who opt out. PS coinbase can choose not to do business with NY, NY businesses and the NY people. Treat New York like most the world treats North Korea. They deserve it after decades of stealing wealth from billions.

it's not to hard to run a fine grit sand paper over it either to smooth it out and finish it up nicely.
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:04:43
read the white paper

I always thought a decentralized exchange was a DAO-like entity running code across multiple computer systems.  How it is accomplished, peer to peer or with servers signing, doesn't really matter imo.
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:08:13
What do you mean take bitcoin mainstream? I dont care  if nor do I even think your grandma should use bitcoin. also, who cares about these fucks who have been screwing shit up for years? Stop dreaming of $.  New York doesnt matter, bitcoin matters and it doesnt want or need this regulation. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:39:40
decentralized exchanges aren't a pipe dream. they will be executed like DAOs. contracts will come, contracts will come out. If one was created using lets say Open Transactions, there would be no block chain recording TXs.  It's also sufficient enough if it's planned out and you don't get hit by any crazy market movements. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:28:17
do it when you need a shower anyways then? I live in California, I've already reduced my showering to every 3rd day, I haven't washed my car in over a month, I extend the life of my dirty clothes, every little bit helps.  In Los Angeles water consumption has actually gone up 30% during this drought, while we're supposed to be cutting back.
So dust yourself off as best you can, then take a shower.
  
I challenge any one else to do the same and also donate thewaterproject.org 
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:34:34
Reusing bath water to fill our toilets would save a million of gallons a day I've heard, but don't quote me on that.
Apparently farmers have already gone the route of trying to drill their own wells here. Issue is the water table is so fucking deep, there's only a few groups that can pull it off and the waiting line is longer than a year now.
There's things we can all do to try and alleviate the issue.  All adventures start with a first step right?
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:44:26
decentralization doesn't protect from hackers or incompetence :) though it is a good defense against Gov't

Water consumption is up 30% in Los Angeles during this drought, every little bit counts.  Pouring 1 gallon of clean water on the ground is a waste of clean water. You might not think so, maybe you live in an area that doesn't have rivers and lakes drying up. I suggest taking a road trip through central California.

yea it was hard to get the audio quality up without it sounding to funky
