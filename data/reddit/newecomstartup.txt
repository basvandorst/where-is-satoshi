Not so sure about that. Ebay only do business with paypal because they own it. They have a brand called braintree which is a little more flexible but I don't think they do anything out of the convention.

We are doing something that is commercially ready as well. It's a marketplace plus a social media platform. Think twitter + ebay

Congrats! Ours is as well. It has been a long journey. So tell me, your business model is to charge for listing item, do you take a cut from the final sales as well? What is the total addressable market for bitcoin marketplace?

We will compete til one is left standing. HAhaha just kidding. I think we have a different product, our site is for mainstream purchase and for businesses. And there is no auction. It has Taxes, Shipping, and other integrations. Beside that, it's also a social network. Check this out  cool website, how long did it takes you to build it?
