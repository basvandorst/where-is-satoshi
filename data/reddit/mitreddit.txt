what are the odds of lightning network being successful?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:55
an unbreakable monetary system that allows more efficient holding and transfers of money than the banking / banking wire system without inflationary risk has value. how much value it has can be debated, as can how much apple and gold have. ultimately the market decides value, but i'm open to a discussion of the theoretical value the market will give it long term if you or anyone has salient points on the subject.

why pretty high? shouldn't there be multiple lightning network like solutions competing to increase the odds of something working well? what is there if lightning network fails / stumbles?

once you invest for a longer period of time you will realize some bludgeoned companies and cryptos don't recover, and some will even die. myspace, american apparel, etc...

personal opinions can be based  on an explainable rational
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:42
do you have a valuation model for cryptos and/or bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:48:09
Don't disagree with that but still curious to hear people rational valuation models. Doesn't seem like many have them

current energy usage is less than 2 billion a year. guess how much the budget of just the us mint is per year?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:13
how do you arrive at those odds?

They said none of their users had ever tried to exploit the vulnerability... and that they've now added measures, presumably to address anyone that tries.

and lost their careers doing that.

what coin do you mine?
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:50:02
goldman recently said bitcoin is headed to 2200  
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:05:11
that will never have a chance to happen unless bitcoin becomes a mainstream currency (and even then who knows), but that will never even have a chance to happen unless the volatility issue is solved.

what's the rational/logic behind your valuation? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:08:35
correction of how much?

why would smart money buy back in a few days if the crash will last longer? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:35:16
gains are always very big in the early years of a growing business/technology, the question is where is bitcoin right now on the early to mature timeline?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:35:20
how much did it gain under obama?

what's the logic/rational of your valuation of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:37:53
nice chart, according to that fair price is about 1500. are the bars in that graph volume of transactions? why is it lower this year?
in any case, the growth trajectory in the chart is likely not going to last forever.

@_date: 2017-05-25 06:03:03
so when is bitcoin going to have quick enough transactions for viable mainstream merchant/consumer usage? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:14:19
but when will this be a reality? when will i be able to buy things directly on say amazon? or at 7 eleven with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:09:16
Why is this not a problem? I'm not saying it is, just curious.
