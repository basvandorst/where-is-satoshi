Any other good alternatives for a block explorer?

Sorry, I should have included an example to make my point clearer. 
Say you want to buy something for $100 with your credit card. Since the merchant has to pay a 3% fee to the bank, they only receive $97 of those $100. 
So, you pay $100, the merchant gets $97.
If the merchant would give you a 2% discount for paying via LN, you would pay via LN of course. Say the tx fees on the LN are around $0.01, which means the merchant receives $97.99.
So, you pay $98, the merchant gets $97.99.
So it's not like giving out free money. In fact the merchant would be highly incentivized to give you a discount, that is lower than the fee they have to pay the bank, because they simply get more money in return.

Well, merchants could offer discounts to anyone paying via LN. This way you would pay less and the merchant could get more than with fiat.

Absolutely fantastic...great work! Looking forward to Andreas and Roger.

Have tried multiple times to receive some coins from the faucet but they never seem to come through to my wallet. Anyone having the same problem?

Great list :)
Might wanna add [3Blue1Brown's introduction video to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies]( It's what finally got me into Bitcoin.

From my understanding, the MAST structure reduces the amount of data within a tx which would otherwise contain long complex scripts to unlock funds. Less data results in cheaper txs.
Schnorr sigs also reduce data by aggregating sigs into a single one while also improving the privacy, because now txs with complex scripts look virtually indistinguishable to normal P2PKH txs.
Maybe someone more knowledgable than me could chime in and let me know if I got something wrong.

So you mean before someone could pull this scheme off quickly enough, we would already have realized that this is a weakness and would have changed the encryption algorithm?

Thanks for the link.

Yes that would probably be easier. However, I wanted to check if my notion is true, that in case of broken ECC, you could potentially even steal funds from P2PKH txs.

Gotcha, thanks!

Great idea! How about using Braille? This will mean more holes but it is way more space-efficient?
Using Braille you could fit more than 24 words on this plate.

Interesting, thanks! Where did you get the information from?

Anyone else unable to open a lightning channel because the wallet says "not enough funds", despite there being enough funds in the wallet?

Ah, good to know. Thanks!
