I don't have enough to do it by myself, but if there was a fund I could contribute a tiny bit.
However, it's the guys who are buying Lamborghinis who are in a position to do this properly. It would protect their own future interests.

The drive speed seems to be critical. A few months ago I set up a node using an external HDD and it took over a week to sync. I started over again with an SSD and it took less than a day.

How much is it costing the spammer to send these transactions? Surely it would be mach greater than the amount sent.

From 0.004 to 4000 is almost exactly a million-fold gain in value.
So if you invested $1 on May 17 2010, you'd have one! million! dollars! today.

Apart from being the record price to date, this number has only a psychological significance. Still, it's pleasant to check the graph every once in a while.

So, do we know which wallets are smart enough to ignore these transactions? Can the "dumb" ones be upgraded?
Is there going to be a dust problem in the future as more tiny transactions accumulate all over the network over the coming years? Is there any way to sweep up and consolidate the dust?

Thanks. TIL.
Edit: Answered below. ~~I'd still like to know if there are any other general user polls on the topic.~~

A poll here would be useless precisely for that reason. It's completely obvious which side would win.
I'm interested in the general public sentiment outside our little forum. :)

No. I'm asking a sub that is against Segwit2X for their opinion about why a poll on Coindesk shows support for Segwit2X, which I did not expect.

Thank you very much. That's an indicator which tells me a lot!

Online at  - it's an Australian site that takes deposits and withdrawals from local banks. Trades are in Australian dollars or various crypto pairs.

That would be people who own some bitcoin. There are probably over a million of them.

I haven't tried it yet, but I hope it has an option for setting display units in milli-BTC and micro-BTC. 
Working in numbers like 0.000123 isn't very intuitive.

Using smaller units would help promote wider adoption. Most people would feel more comfortable working with 145,020 satoshis than 0.0014502 BTC.

I remember some people referring to it as "buttcoin" a couple of years ago. They were the same sort of people who had earlier said the Internet would never go anywhere.
