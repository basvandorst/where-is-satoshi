Based on the following assumptions:
* one bitcoin could be worth one million in 10 years
* mining reward 2 halfings later plus fees should be about 5 bitcoin per block
* around 50% of mining rewards are spent on electricity to archive economic equilibrium
* electricity is about 5c/kwh in the areas where mining is done
If you put together those numbers, the yearly electricity need of bitcoin mining in 10 years would add up to 


2 629.74383 terawatt hours 
So somewhere between 10-15% of the [global electricity consumption in 2009](
Is there any way out of this trajectory, except reducing the block rewards by hardfork? 
Looking at the growth so far, a million in 10 years even seems moderate and it also wont stop there.
It would also not really help, if clean energy get abundant in that short time frame, as abundant means cheap and miners would consume even more energy in consequence.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:25:40
By design, to secure the network at market cap x, a proportional amount of energy must be wasted yearly. Otherwise it would be too cheap for an attacker to get &gt;50%. 
To secure the network at 100 billion market cap (right now), the wasted energy already equals Denmark.
My concern is, that this requirement for wasting energy does not scale well.

You are right 60x is a lot, especially as 16k does not exactly reflect a realistic price point at the moment imho. My "just" was more related to the factor bitcoin/total money just being 180 right now. That is insane! Thanks for the source.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:32:32
Do you have a source? A million is just 60x from what it is worth now.  If you are right bitcoin is already 1/180 of total money and I somehow doubt that.
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:13:07
Bitcoin is currently consuming about half a gigawatt of power. Assuming the price would rise a factor of 1000 within the next halfing, it's logical that money spent for mining and thus power consumption would grow to 250GW. There is 700 million cars. Asuming they are driven a 10th of a day in average and consume around 50hp on average, cars in total consume close to 2000GW. So actually the metaphor isn't so bad.
@_date: 2014-12-26 10:39:39
I tried it and have been watching the price for quite some while. From what i have seen the basic promise of maintaining your worth relative to the dollar worked out pretty well so far. I do not have experience about the yield, but i think it is hardly worth mentioning at the moment, as bitusd is not used very much and yield comes directly from usage fees afaik.
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:10:35
Are you saying the compromise is not to hard fork to a smaller block size?
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:57:49
I still don't understand what concessions are made to call it a compromise. How would Segwit look it was not a compromise?
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:56:39
I don't think having money stolen is the main concern here. 
It is more about the question - do i want some hackers have my private data associated with that record? 
That data will probably get sold and might end up anywhere.
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:24:46
Can you tell me what advantages we would get from not disregarding the witness data? Compromise implies something was given up in exchange for the increased capacity and I still have a hard time figuring out what.

I think it is astonishing how so many people write ethereum is a scam and they have nothing to show for. If you check their github repositories or watch their presentations or read the paper and watch their talks, you can clearly see they are very committed to their idea, putting in tons of work and transparent about their progress.
The claim it must be scam, because they accepted money upfront instead of doing everything for free seems like total nonsense to me as well. Afaik there are lots of people working on this full time. How are they supposed to make a living?

They write that directly in the lighthouse client. I guess the anyone-can pay-transaction method of the bitcoin protocol got a limit on how many signatures it can pack into one transaction. While 684 pledges is not to bad, it will still prevent many usecases where lighthouse would be really awesome.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:18:05
I guess I really need to read up way more on Segwit to understand. Up to now I thought the ~2.1MB were only the effective block size while the diskspace and bandwidth requirements stayed at 1MB. Thanks for the answer, I think you guided me in the right direction.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:48:14
Very nice software. To bad there is a hard limit of 684 pledges due to bitcoin protocol limits.

That's not really how science is supposed to work. You are expected to fulfill certain standards in your methods and your writing. If the writing is sloppy there is a good chance, the quality of the underlying work is sloppy as well.
I have no idea how to design that experiment, that is why I would really like to read how someone else solved it. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:27:59
The numbers are just not important. I just wanted to answer your question by saying it is not so much about the botnets being more powerful (which I still think they are), but about the incentive beeing much higher than 5 years ago. If you want to see those numbers backed up, just look at the marketcap increase since bitcoin was beeing mined by cpus for the last time.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:08:21
From what I read Segwit transactions look like anyone can spend to old miners, so why would the 60% of nonsegwit miners not mine a chain with a transaction spent by anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:09:29
Nice, very good read! I did not know the effective throughput is so low.

if i hadn't found out about his involvement with r3 later on, i could have sworn this was his plan all along.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:01:03
I have read the anyone-can-spend trick of Segwit is not a problem as Segwit miners do still check validity and would not mine on a chain from a non-Segwit miner, where one of these has been spend illegally. Does this still hold if the Segwit miners are a minority?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:10:10
As far as I see it, if 60% of miners would decide to change their code and mine such a 100BTC chain, there would be a hard fork. So if the answer is the same, the 60% of non-segwit miners would also create a hard fork. But still you say, that is not going to happen. My question is why? I just can not understand why miners, that do not upgrade, would not include anyone-can-spend transactions into their chain. And I don't see how that chain would not be the longest when it is supported by all those 60%. As far as I understand, there would be a hardfork, with one chain having 60% of miners, that don't support segwit and one chain with the 40%, that do not accept illegally spent anyone-can-spent transactions. I understand that a 100BTC chain would probably die out over time, but that does not mean there is no hard fork. In my understanding UASF would cause a hard fork, unless it is guaranteed the segwit portion is always over 50%. I am trying to find out, where I am wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:10:37
sure, i think bitcoin price is a beautiful fractal

I hate these absolute statements. As if you could possibly know. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:20:28
As I said, the link is indeed interesting. I would still not call it science.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:50:44
I still don't really understand? What is the mechanism here, that stops the 60% of old miners from mining on the longest chain. From my understanding the unspendable anyone-can-spend transaction is backwards incompatible and there would be a fork. I did not know economic analysis was part of the mining code.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:36:28
Nobody is talking of cracking SHA256. All I am saying is CPU mining might have been safe 5 years ago, when the network was to small for any serious botnet owner to consider an attack. I dont think it is safe enough anymore.

you just explained logaritmic scale =)
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:44:42
In a hypothetical scenario where Segwit is activated via UASF, but only 40% of miners adopt Segwit: If someone spends a anyone-can-spend output and the 60% of old miners agree on that transaction, will there be a hard fork between the 40% Segwit miners and the 60% non-Segwit miners?
@_date: 2017-02-01 19:59:25
it would allow you to buy influence on the miners. activating features could be bought. you want larger blocks? just pay enough fees to only miners that signal BU and incentivise them it that way. after that it only depends on what price you are willing to pay.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:29:35
Have you ever read a scientific paper? The only place for your opinion is in the conclusion, you don't write anything in first person and quantification like "usage is not too bad right now" will land you piece in the trash bin. You were talking about actual science, so that is what I was interested in. As I said, it is still an interesting read, but I would never call this science.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:08:17
it is still the same problem. nobody would spend 10 million to destroy a 100 million network. make that 10 million to destroy 17 billion and you might find someone to do it. The ratio between cost of an attack and impact is important.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:00:47
roger ver must be your personal jesus if you apply this metric.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:36:22
I must misunderstand something here. If at any point in time the Segwit hashrate would be below 50% for some extended time, someone could trigger a hard fork by spending a free for all output? I don't think UASF would be considered, if that was the case.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:09:40
How can you determine, if it is any amount of users? Could I as individual not just fake thousands of users? I always thought that is the reason for PoW in the first place.

Maybe I am blind, which of these would you say give a good insight about the practical limit?
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:30:14
The network was worth way less, when it was mined with cpus and gpus last time. Incentives to attack the network scale proportional to the market cap.

@_date: 2017-03-07 17:52:39
thanks for your efforts, they are much appreciated. I have the feeling however, I am getting more and more confused. There would be a split into two networks, one with the old miners and old nodes and one with the new ones? But it would be different from a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:56:06
back then bitcoin was not worth as much. cpus were enough to protect 10 million marketcap. But a 17 billion bounty is another thing.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:29:10
So you are saying, if it was a hard fork, both chains would be valid. But in this case only one chain will be valid, and thus it is not a hard fork. Do I understand that right?
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:33:30
wow, this brad peterson is an absolute pro at not giving an answer. i watched his answer like 5 minutes and this guys was not getting to any point whatsoever. 
from what he is talking it sounds like he got no idea. kazaa and napster as examples for p2p?? 10 years ago maybe.
Also he is talking about proof of work. do banks really plan to outcompete eachother in their private blockchain with hashing power? Does that make any sense at all? I would have always imagined they decide the amounts of block in a more political way. Why the hell would they use PoW with 42 known participants?
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:48:04
I think it would be nice if everyone can run a full node. But I also think a ~1GW payment system should be able to handle more than seven transaction per second. If it turns out you cannot have both, I am not really sure which compromise is the better one.
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:46:48
that is actually a good question. if 95% of miners did that, what else could you do? The 5% rest of the network could hardly offer you any security.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:38:19
Just doing experiments is not enough. You need to give clear instructions, how to replicate your results and you need to give sources for any claim you make, that is not your original thesis. If you really want to know I recommend reading about the [scientific method](
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:42:37
Looks like you found out your self, that your answer was not very helpful (way to many papers and too little data on the topic). I don't see what importance luke-jr plays in any scientific approach. If I already had such a strong opinion, I would not be looking for scientific data. What do I know, if non city americans should run a full node? If you use bitcoin only as a settlement layer, there might be no real reason to run full nodes in small villages.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:46:21
can you link a paper? actual science on the practical limit sounds interesting!
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:33:30
well calculate it yourself: 25(BTC/block)*500($/BTC)/2000(average transactions/block)/.15($/kWh)=41.66 kWh/transaction.
average consumption in the US seems to be about 30kwh, so it sounds about right. The values i used should be precise enough for the purpose of this calculation.

so the leftover chain with all the people that did not manage to adapt the hard fork within less than 12-18 month could then easily do a hard fork on their own within a short time frame?
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:05:10
You're right, seems to be a block every two hours. My point still stands. If you want to transfer your BCC you could do so within about half a day. The bigger reason we are not seeing huge sell offs is, that exchanges don't allow BCC deposits yet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:46:36
Don't they need different transactions anyways due to the replay protection?
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:38:59
There is a block about every hour, and none of them is full. So transaction capacity is actually higher right now. Not beeing able to deposit to exchanges is the only culprit here.
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:56:18
What a stupid comparison. People say that all the time. There are clones for almost every product and many of them are way cheaper for similar quality. And even, if it is worse quality, people often buy it, as they care more about the price than the quality. Just look at the success of banggood, hobbyking, Alibaba etc.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:53:23
If you really get twice the throughput fees should be less than half, as there are more low fee transactions than high fee transactions and fees will be less competitive.

What does that even mean? If none of the larger players would go the BIP148 route, you will still run your BIP148 node? for how long? You would not use the "legacy" network anymore even if &gt; 99% of all people use it? As far as I see it, only merchants, exchanges, payment providers, wallets etc. matter.

@_date: 2017-07-24 18:19:59
It offers bigger blocks and no Segwit. I was under the impression, part of the bitcoin community was asking for that. It might be the smaller part of the community by far, but it looks to me to be quite similar to the ETH/ETC case.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:11:23
Are you implying people would just stop using their miners, because they could not manage to get more power from the grid? What components do you think one has to have "sitting around" to draw more power? And even if a data center would be near max capacity, which most of them surely are not, why would people not organize an upgrade upfront or move the miners?
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:33:29
I have the feeling running a UASF node is the new facebook like. It kinda shows there is a person supporting an idea, but it can be easily faked and in the end it just means about nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:08:49
This is wrong on so many levels. 
Total latency is the sum of (distance traveled/speed of light)+(blocksize/bandwidth). So the latency added by speed of light will always be the same, as long as the distance travelled between both locations does not change. The blocksize dependent part of latency is only proportional to bandwidth.
Why would miners prefer the "longer block"? Actually the miners would receive the shorter block faster if you sent them both at the same time and thus mine on the shorter one slightly longer. Only thing relevant here is the longer chain.
Also, that is not "why we wait 10 minutes". People are supposed to wait longer than 1 confirmation. And even if they did, a miner could find a block almost instantly after you send the transaction. The 10 minutes are not even the average time a block will be found after you transact, unless you only ever transact directly after a block has been found.
This dude sounds like he got hardly any idea of either physics or bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:13:09
Does it really make sense to copy the blocks? I thought BCC would create a new genesis block snapshoting the current UXTO.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:02:39

Asicboost does not increase hashrate of your miners, but improves energy efficiency. So there will be no drop in hashrate when it stops working. Even if there would have been, the claim could be easily disproved, if the combined hashrate of btc and bcc does not add up to the previous hashrate of btc.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:58:19
So, if at any point in the future the community needs to hard fork. Core develops and tests it over years and then finaly deploys it, despite a 7% minority beeing against it, you would call that a hostile hard fork?
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:43:55
Out of my gut I'd say, it probably is already possible to do that today and the cluster you need to do it isn't even very large. I am pretty sure it will be doable in 10 years. I am to lazy to back it up with actual number though. Just do a bit of google research your self if you are really curious.

I looked at the code. I found the block size defined as 2MB here 
And checked against here: 
Maybe I fell to the obfuscation, but for me it looks like the limit is 2MB.

@_date: 2017-07-02 10:32:10
Just took a quick look at the code. This is what I found: 
It looks to me like the base block size is defined as 2 MB. If any of the miners changes this only for him self, all other miners would still reject blocks larger than 2MB. Could you please link me the code, where 8MB are ok? I still have a hard time believing this.

What makes that hard fork hostile? I thought they were forking of peacefully with proper replay protection.
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:41:01
I'm not really an expert on those. But assuming Moors Law holds up, block validation takes &lt;50ms today (quick google result) and verification does scale roughly linear to the amount of transactions it would take about ((8 billion / (7 * 86 400)) * (50 ms)) / (1.6^10) =
6.0151766 seconds to validate a block. Assembly might be similar, but I think it is a non issue anyways, any computation done by miners or pools is dwarfed immensely by proof of work either way.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:04:57
I'm not sure. I thought the same about ETC. Only a matter of time before it goes to zero. Who in their right mind would be interested in a chain without real developer support? Look where it is now. I expect a very similar thing to happen with BCC. Price will be much lower than BTC, but there will be to many seeing a good buy before it drops down to 10$.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:08:10
Who is not mining empty blocks on principle? As far as I know every miner is mining empty blocks for as long as it takes to receive the previous block, to make sure you are not finding an invalid block. Not doing so would only make you less competitive. Please link me to any miner stating he is passing on those profits out of principle. Also note, that those times are not reliable as clocks are not perfectly synchronized. Just compare blocks 478036 and 478037. If those times were accurate, 037 had been found before 036.

I think he meant before he will withdraw his BTC back to his own wallet.

If a company is building your house, they have built 100% of your house so far and you could still easily fire them. Also isn't calling someone else a moron toxic in your eyes?

What meaning does it have? Best it could do, is to show the real important players (exchanges, payment providers etc.) there is some interest from individuals. Even if you get 10000 people to run such a node, that is almost nobody compared to how many people use bitcoin. And you still would not know how many of those nodes are fake. Imho it is as useful as a facebook like or your signature under an online petition. Just way more complicated.

To be fair, I do not think he meant for this vision to be today. If you give Bitcoin 10 years, before nearly everybody is using it and assume Nelsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth holds up, this would equal ((30 Gb) / (10 minutes)) / (1.5^10) = 108.384562 kBps of bandwidth today, which does not seem outrageously high.

So as long as total fees per block go down below 15% of the 12.5btc block reward, including no segwit transactions and mining with asicboost is still more profitable? Even more so the more non-segwit transactions are in the mempool.

I think they could secretely mine empty blocks for a while, then make that chain public, instantly sell anything mined and cause mayhem with the reorg or something like that.

I am confused. Two posts earlier you say Segwit2x is the result of bip148. Now you say bip148 is not responsible for Segwit2x. Wich is it?

Please, do the math before you say stuff like this. Even if you convinced EVERY owner of an obsolete (FPGA and GPU) miner, you would not even have one percent of the current hashrate. Someone with luke-jr's expertice in bitcoin should know this. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:50:29
Security is not proportional to hashrate alone. It is proportional to hashrate times cost per hash. If calculating one hash is 4 times more work and you get only 1/4 of the hashrate security does not change.

I was trying to say, that SegWit on its own will not allow for all those use cases.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:08:52
If you are convinced your actions forced others to act, you certainly can agree, that you are at least partially responsible for their actions. Imagine startling someone, so he jumps of a cliff. It might be his decision and it might be a totally inappropriate reaction. But wouldn't you still be responsible for it?

I don't think fees really matter if your mining hardware is inefficient by a factor of 1000.
@_date: 2017-06-25 09:28:15
I think we are using a different understanding of responsible. I am using it in a sense of being the cause of something and I assume you are using it more in a sense of being liable for something.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:18:05
Please also consider, that your miner is probably inefficient by a factor of 1000. The only difference it will make, will be in your electricity bill.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:07:45
Even if you were right, and we almost instantly had the full 2MB blocks from SegWit, which we probably wont, that would by far not be enough to allow all those use cases.

My post was not intended to talk about core or bitcoin at all. I was just trying to say, that it is possible to fire someone, after he did all the work on a project - even if you continue the project on that basis. I think its ok to "call them out", but the last two words of your original post were not part of that, they were just an unnecessary insult.

Couldn't they just sell the coins they mined during the attack for profit?
