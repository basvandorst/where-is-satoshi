Seems totally legit. I also made 0.5 btc in just 5mins in January.
All I did was just login to a site and buy it. I just want to share my happiness and now I am fcking bleeding.

Out of my two balls, one ball says it will and the one says it won't.
BTW--I meant my crystal balls.

Best feeling to see your portfolio grow every few hours.

I hope you don't hatch a bitcoin gold.

The question should be, does anyone has any money left to buy? ��

No big news no Nothing. Some strange shit. I am trying to figure out too. 
Market Cap drop by 45B in just few hours  definitely doesn't sound like manipulation either. 
Some weird shit going on.

My answer might be harsh but Here it is... 
That's fine. I still make money investing instead of you just having your money sit in the bank. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:55:35
Lol. I don't even own bch. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:11:06
Looking at this, my balls hurt and I have to feel them to make sure they are still there. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:43:29
Transferring bitcoin to criminals or for criminal activity is definitely illegal.

Apart from the totally agreeable comments above, the only other dust I know is the one my wife tells me to clean every week. ��

Good question. Good luck getting the right answers. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:48:04
Use gdax and limit buy and sell orders. 
Example - buy ltc for $200 and set limit sell order to $210.
Keep an eye on the prices. Once sold, look out for spikes. Make sure you don't buy when the volume Is spiking. If you would have bought it already, set a limit sell order again.
It's all about the time. Make sure you don't godly when it's dropping. Always limit orders. Both buy and sell.
These are just some ways I use. There might be other ideas from other people. Everyone does it different.

Go to coinmarketcap.com and click on bitcoin or any other currency you want to buy and then go to markets tab which will list all the sites you can buy. Look for sites that says usd/btc or eur/btc(depends on your country currency) Which means you can buy btc with fiat.

Traditional assets are good - 10years &lt;5% may be. - less risk
Crypto - infinite growth or get screwed(if you are a dumb ass) - more risk.
Moral - less risk = less returns. More risk = more returns.
Remember - invest responsibly and play with profits to max gains.

Damn... I never knew this at all. Wow. What a great advice. I will definitely buy for another 18k right now.

If you are in US, I heard that Arizona state will accept btc as tax payment. If it will be a success, it might get rolled out to other states as well.
Just my thought.

30% of 1000 is 300 and so your account should show 1300. 3% of 1000 is 30

If you quickly register in Coinbase, you can quickly buy if the verification is quickly done. 
If not, quickly create an account in binance. Ask your friend to quickly buy and qucikly transfer the btc (who already is a crypto trader or buyer). It will quickly appear in binance.
Once your coinbase account is quickly verified, you can quickly transfer it back to coinbase. 
Problem. Quickly solved. 
You are quickly happy..
