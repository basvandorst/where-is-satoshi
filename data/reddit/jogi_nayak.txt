Waiting for 3k

My transaction of .4 BTC confirmed at 1sat/byte. It took around 10-15 minutes. Moved my funds to a Segwit address! I'm really excited for bitcoin if transactions could get cheaper than this! Lightning coming? 
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:45:58
I don't think it's that easy right now.. I find it hard being a tech person to understand crypto fully. It's going to take some time to convince the masses. Unless we make crypto really really easy to use. I'm sure people are working hard for this to happen. Hope lightning really kicks off. ��

Not all my savings but half! And hoping it sky rockets :) 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:46:47
Great stuff! Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:01:56
I'm 28 and I have a decent job. I could always make it back. But it would still feel bad to lose all that money. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:17:25
I spent $6300 to get .42BTC and 1.15ETH. I wonder how many people are in a worse position than me :(
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:02:08
Yes! I'm planning to accept payments in BTC on my website. I would be able to work from anywhere and get customers from any where in the world. This would be real freedom. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:42:21
This is awesome man. Thank you.. Will go through! 
@_date: 2019-03-16 11:59:02
Stop being emo guys. It's a good joke! 
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:19:53
I don't blame them. So many people have lost money to wallets being hacked. It's scary even for a tech person like me. Most people don't care about a revolution. They don't think about the bigger picture. They just want to lead an ordinary life. For them, it's a headache to manage their own money. They'd rather leave it to banks for a nominal fee. Bitcoin may replace Fiat the day each every child on this planet is taught about money and is tech savvy. Education is key! Until then fiat will rule.

My bad. I should've mentioned it's a proposed bill  and there's high chances it will be law.
No reason for me to do a click bait. I don't work for this website. Being an Indian, I'm just shocked by this news.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:54:52
Even if it does work, what about LN being off chain and reliant on third party trust. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:40:12
Guys is there still a chance that you can lose money in lightning?
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:08:14
What the hell? Seriously? Which normal person would ever go through this to transfer funds?! The only reason I love bitcoin is because it's trustless and decentralized. Now you're saying I need to rely on a trusted third party to make the transfer? And after all this, I may lose my funds?! I'd rather use bank transfer! They take even my $5 transfer seriously.
All these people saying "it's an acceptable risk" For small amounts. Who are you to decide what's small and what's big? Every damn transaction needs to be valued if Bitcoin is to be mass adopted. And looking at all this, it seems like the day is really far. 
Some thing just doesn't seem right with all of this! I always thought the guys at BCH were bullshitting but all this makes me rethink! It looks like bitcoin has the difficulty which makes it more reliable but scaling issue is far from being solved. 
Can someone please enlighten me about what's the drawback in  increasing the block size like BCH? 
Sorry i may be sounding like a noob! But these are questions people are going to ask! 
P. S. I am a tech person trying to understand bitcoin and lighting network. Still find it all quite confusing.
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:14:56
What is the incentive to run a full node? I feel like supporting the bitcoin network but think twice because I have to spend money to do so. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:48:22
Is it possible to introduce some sort of an incentive so that more people support?
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:56:31
I bought a lot at 12k. Hopefully the prices fall further so that I can save up and buy more and make it one BTC :) 
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:12:58
I'm going to gift my great grandson the Lambo with my 0.4btc
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:56:36
I don't see any real adoption. This bull run is definitely manipulation. Get ready for 2k.
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:38:26
That really depends on what people believe in. I feel if majority are convinced, it can happen sooner. No govt. can and should stop it. After all, they are meant to be for the people.
I guess the only problem BTC faces is people losing faith in it or using it for profits and converting to fiat. Awareness needs to grow that it is money. I think people involved in crypto need to go all out in trying to educate people about what it is. I'm a computer science student and still find it hard to grasp. Ordinary people will take time. I agree there's years left. But I can wait and HODL. That's the least I can do to support something I truly believe in. I hope the tech catches up and it becomes more pervasive. That way, people don't need to sell. And can use it as it is. 
I also plan to start accepting payment in bitcoin on my website soon.  We all need to do our bit to make this happen. Of course it will be risky to accept it as payment. Considering how the price is falling. But we need to grow some balls and start accepting it. That's the only way the price can even rise. People are like sheep. When they see bitcoin logo everywhere, they will think it's something LEGIT and only then they'll make an effort to find out what it's all about.
Bitcoin already has a good reputation for having survived nine years. I think if it survives this bear market once again, it will instill more faith in people. HODL on! ��

It won't die but get ready for 2k.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:58:41
No big rewards without big risks ��
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:42:06
Wonderful. I've already ordered the book. Looking forward to it! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:44:12
Will wait. I bought with the intention of using BTC as money someday and not to convert it for short term profits. Fuck dollars! I hope people understand how amazing the tech actually is. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:03:19
Thanks for the info. Yes I should join the groups mentioned above and read that book! I'm good at programming on the Web. But I have no idea how bitcoin is built. Will give it a try though. Would love to contribute to this potential revolution if I can! 
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:40:43
I really hope! Put in quite a bit of my savings in it. I really think bitcoin is the shizz. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:05:03
Anyone else bought at 12k like me and didn't sell at the top? I feel like shit right now! Not being able to buy at the low prices. You guys think it'll ever go back up that much again? 
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:07:49
These bull traps are getting obvious and annoying.
