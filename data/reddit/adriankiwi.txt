If I recover my money I will try another wallet.

My phone is totally clean. Can you recommand me a wallet?
@_date: 2018-07-23 07:12:45
I use fingerprint, and nobody from my family/friends know about my btc
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:04:10

@_date: 2018-07-22 18:09:14
But bro, how tf to change my wallet adress? I think it is a bug or I've been hacked
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:20:21
Thanks for the kind words. I have already sent an email, I hope to solve it. If not, then even this application is a great scam.
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:03:55
Hmm. Nobody have acces to my phone :/
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:57:02
Move to another wallet. Mycelium isn t safe... i have proofs. If you want I can show you on facebook 
@_date: 2018-07-22 19:52:48


What does "lightning network" mean or what do you mean by that?
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:23:42


Yes, I made a backup before and now I have returned it, but apparently from the application it changed the code to the wallet, so it is an even more serious problem. My old Wallet is probably to someone else.
