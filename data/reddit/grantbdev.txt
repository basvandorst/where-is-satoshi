Please consider donating. The LPL has had outstanding growth since the 2012 election and is building local organizations from the ground up. We have candidates running for major positions this year, including a candidate for US Senate running against Mary Landrieu and the Republicans. Many Louisiana Libertarians are pro-Bitcoin.
Louisiana has a jungle primary system, so 3rd party candidates can never "spoil" an election.

What is your libertarian justification for supporting government-mandated net neutrality?

You really don't seem to understand what I said. The LNC doesn't have bitcoin addresses listed that they own. You cannot donate to the LNC with bitcoin without filling out the BitPay form which gives you an address owned by BitPay for that address. Then BitPay distributes the money to their clients. Therefore, there is no real information you can gain from putting a BitPay bitcoin address on blockchain.info, the LNC could received less or more than 0.0849 BTC.

They've accepted it for a couple of years. Donate the first time you get the "I am Satoshi Nakamoto" badge. Donate a the second time and you get the "Double-spend Attack badge." Here are mine:

It's through BitPay, I don't think they have one address per merchant and they might share addresses between some. So blockchain analysis probably isn't going to work.

Cody Wilson didn't lose because of his political views. Cody Wilson lost because he wanted to destroy the Bitcoin Foundation, which obviously wasn't going to be that popular with the voters who paid to be members.

I got mine today, but then I noticed the dormancy fee and I decided it wasn't worth activating it at this time.

My understanding was BitPay had a 3 year deal to sponsor this bowl, I guess they backed out.
