This is literally a warning to bitcoin users, specifically.
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:34:38


What?  
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:54:23


Do you mean above the atmosphere (ie space)?   Because there are lots of people mining Bitcoin with solar power on the ground (in atmosphere).'


Your statements are unclear with or without context.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:25:10
I agree completely.  I hope it's not you who downvoted me.  I said "It's time" to mirror the comment I replied to.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:57:59
While relevant, that's not the kind of duplication he's talking about here.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:13:14
I assume you mean fiat that is still gold-backed (unlike USD)?  Gold-backed fiat is a promise from a central entity.  Lightning transactions aren't promises, they are a cryptographic capability to make a real Bitcoin transaction at any time.  If anyone decides to cheat, the others just publish the Lightning transaction to the blockchain and take what they're owed.  So long as no one cheats or goes offline, and cheating should be pointless, you can transact virtually for free.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:23:51
It's time to stop leaving money in exchanges, period.  Deposit, trade, withdraw.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:09:51
Whoever decides to cash out takes the most recent LN channel state and broadcasts it on the blockchain, paying the fee to do so.  Shouldn't be a problem since LN means that as many transactions as you want can fit in one channel.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:09:29
The Lightning Network guys have plans to implement cross-chain transactions with no counterparty risk.  Others do too.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:28:29
If you don't understand how Bitcoin or the blockchain works, you shouldn't be buying, IMHO.  One day it will all be stable and friendly enough that you don't need to understand it, and that will be great, but that day is not today.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:18:03
Something like: users * 2 Bitcoin transactions per month/year/arbitrary settlement period, regardless of how many transactions.  Bitcoin TXs are linear time/space/bandwidth given that all nodes have to know about them.
And each LN transaction is potentially constant time/space/bandwidth since only the nodes involved need to know about them.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:22:18
As I understand it, LN gets its security from the fact that at any time, either participant in a channel can force the "cash out" of the current LN channel to the Bitcoin blockchain, making everyone agree that he has money now.  If you remove the blockchain layer, what do you commit to at the end?
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:24:24
I think we have a misunderstanding as to the definition of "understand".  If you don't understand the stock market, you shouldn't pick your own stocks, no.  You buy funds that do that for you.  If you don't know what an engine is, you shouldn't drive a car, and if you don't know what spark plugs are you shouldn't be your own mechanic.
CPUs are immensely complex, but knowing the basic principles is enough for IT.  The ideas behind blockchains are simple, though the implementation is complex.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:11:54
Lots of early adopters got in by mining on their PCs like I did.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:26
Easy, yes.  But inefficient.  A bigger block size means that every full node has to download, store, and seed those MB to everyone.  The blockchain is already huge and is growing.  LN is supposed to allow more traffic without so much resource consumption.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:23:20
It didn't happen.  He's fishing for donations.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:03:57
Ah I misunderstood what you meant.  Yes, generating a key on a poorly secured device then moving it would be pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:14:09
Does that mean that deflationary currencies could act as a counter to the rampant consumerism that is destroying the environment?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:57:20
Are you disputing that people go to jail for not paying tax, or disputing that it's a bad thing?  Your comment isn't clear.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:28:41
Bitcoin not being anonymous is a technical flaw that is being actively worked on.  I wouldn't bet on cryptocurrency staying traceable.

Segwit does something along those lines.  Read up on that.  Also this video is pretty cool:

"Fortunes are made by buying low and selling too soon".
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:03
I don't see why.  If you find a bug and how to trigger it reliably, that's still a big help.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:29
Satoshi fully intended BTC to get this popular.  He also intended for people to upgrade it to handle the load.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:23:31
The problem is that they are secretly injecting javascript into people's sessions.  Also why all sites need TLS.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:39:33
That's not actually an argument.  If you're going to bother arguing for a cause, use arguments based on fact, not appeals to the majority.  Ie, prove that taxation is good, not that most people believe it to be so.  There are a lot of things we now know to be true that "sane people" wouldn't have considered a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:08
By "online" they mean having the keys on a computer which is internet connected, not literally posting it.
@_date: 2018-09-17 04:23:30
By using millibitcoin, as people are already starting to use, or microbitcoin which may be needed already?

I've seen it attributed to lots of rich investors :P
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:07:36
It doesn't need to be.  The success scenario for crypto is that you stop needing to exchange it to buy most things.
@_date: 2018-09-17 04:24:27
The problem of creating a secure currency is 100% manufactured?  Sure, currency was manufactured by humans, but I don't think that's what you're talking about here.

What's the point of having "anonymous" money that you can't spend without revealing your ID?  Also, Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:13:56
If it broke overnight, yes.  If theoretical weaknesses were discovered well before they could be exploited, the network would probably upgrade to a new hash, although that would be quite an upheaval.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:40:46
I don't think starting an explanation of Bitcoin with mining is good - mining is a technical detail that doesn't need to be mentioned until they ask where it's produced.

They provide an entertainment service (gambling) and take a fee.  If you don't like it, don't gamble.  You can't use that argument to justify defrauding the site.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:23:21
Long-term investment is fine, the problem is people buying and selling every time they read an article about Bitcoin or whatever.
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:59:56
Any money still in Greek banks is vulnerable to being stolen by the government to prop themselves up, as Cyprus did.  It's only half the currency stability, the other is that Bitcoin is the third alternative to bank or mattress.

Maybe I'm just biased, but I'm having trouble imagining a adult who has bitcoin and cannot comprehend that 49.50% is less than 50%.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:11:44
Card counting should be legal, yes, it's just playing well.  But I don't see why you are assuming that the people playing their game don't understand statistics.  Many people gamble because they find it fun, not because they expect to make money.  Their 1% fee is quite reasonable.  If someone bets $5 once a minute, they would (on average) lose $3 in an hour.  $3 an hour is pretty cheap entertainment.

Any sentence that includes "all you bitcoiners are against ..."  will be wrong.  Bitcoin supporters include capitalists, ancaps, libertarians, anarchists, minarchists and just about everything else.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:52:37
Well, you could convert to Bitcoin to exfiltrate the money, then convert to shares of gold in someone else's vault.  You would be proof against currencies crashing but not as much against theft. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:15:25
And email isn't remotely secure, so it's a great example of why people will use easy services at the cost of security, just like a Bitcoin bank would work.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:41:52
Right, the blockchain would be worthless for timestamping, but not for Bitcoin in general, I meant.
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:46:19
Just because it can be "rigged" due to small market cap does not prove that it is rigged.
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:14:14
You misunderstand - I don't gamble.  It's not worth the money.  I'm just pointing out the assumptions being made.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:25:01
Right, which is why I mean that if we are going to try to get the average joe to use Bitcoin, then we need to create systems that allow him to actually get the benefits of it without sacrificing too much convenience.

Lots of countries do now, many sites are being banned.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:50:48
Or better yet, stop looking for Satoshi, because he doesn't want to be found, and we don't want to find him.  It would do no good and much harm.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:23:57
But they also create volatility, changing their positions with every article and blog post.  Customers &amp; businesses create less liquidity but also less volatility.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:23:02
They aren't defrauding people.  It's not like a lottery where it's all "1 in 5 chance of winning!" or whatever.  Their page literally says:
Payout: 2x  Win Chance: 49.50%.  It's pretty obvious exactly where they make their money and how much.  If you still click Roll the Dice, you can't blame them for your lost money.
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:41:44
I think you're forgetting that many "full" nodes aren't port-forwarded and up most of the time.  If new people were told to use Bitcoin-QT, synced it, then started it up every few weeks, they'd be harming the network, not helping it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:01:28
The main mistake that you made here was to completely miss the point of crypto by letting someone else hold your money for you for a bit of convenience..  That being said, I hope you get it back.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:20:15
Well, it seems you are into cryptocurrencies for different reasons than some.  Some people feel that a big advantage of cryptocurrencies is having a currency that functions without the need to appeal to a central authority or violence.  If all you want is a currency that's clearly pegged to gold, sure, that makes sense.
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:13:18
Convenience is what people want.  Security &amp; freedom is what people need.  Just because the average person doesn't understand the need to control his own money, doesn't mean it's not important.
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:14:09
Ok, and what makes them give you gold when you request it?  What prevents the government from walking in and taking it if it becomes a problem?
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:29:43
It "looked legitimate" when it doesn't even have TLS?
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:50:41


The point of trustless cryptosystems is that you don't rely on promises.  If a certain amount of bitcoin belongs to you, then you have the keys, and no one else does.  Money that you don't have doesn't belong to you.  This is why things like smart contracts are being worked on so heavily - the aim is to reduce the difference between "should" and "is" however possible.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:56:24
Why use a pool when there is p2pool?  Way safer, and 100% uptime.  Cloud hashing is nice, though, if you trust the site to some degree.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:16:15
Just in case?  10 years, after all.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:04:35
Did you not even get the Cyprus reference? If you'll recall the news from a while ago, many bank accounts in Cyprus were skimmed for significant percentages by thieves, regardless of the security of their online banking passwords, or the thickness of their vault doors. 10 Million Euro stolen overnight from an entire country's population.
That is certainly equal or worse than $1M USD in Bitcoin being stolen due to an entire string of preventable security mistakes.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:34:13
But you see, there is no reason that there can't be Bitcoin banks.  Those who want banks can have them, those who prefer their own wallets are free to do so.  Preferring a bank-only system is only a reduction in features.  Perhaps as Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will arise banks that take care of security, are willing to cover fraud, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:38:03
Taking the levy _may_ have been the best way out, at the time.  But I think we can agree that it only came to that because the government screwed up.  Can we?  Also, I never said Bitcoin, I said a secure currency, which arbitrary numbers in a bank's server is not.  Can we agree on that as well?
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:48:33
Actually, it is that simple.  However, I never said it was easy.  The best way to prevent theft and fraud in general is tech like decentralized exchanges(atomic transactions) for digital assets, webs of trust like PGP if that's possible (ie physical assets).  However, those may not work for all transactions, and so it all comes down to you doing your own due diligence.  After all, we as a community can work on ways to reduce theft, but ultimately it's your money and your responsibility.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:44:37
As Bitcoin's value rises and tech improves, losses should decrease constantly as people are more careful.  Most losses happened in the days of prices measured in cents, not thousands of dollars.  Also, since Bitcoin allows fractional values, it's not that big of a deal.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:07:13
However, you also need to factor in that most high-value targets are running Linux servers, so attacks against Linux are still researched a lot.  But I realize these are often different software.  Making a "virus" for Linux is trivial, it's getting someone to run it as root that is harder.  But some users are careless.
@_date: 2014-01-27 13:40:29
My point is that the bank account is unsafe, now that Cyprus has proved that even a supposedly democratic government can decide to take your money at any time without the consent of the governed, thus changing bank accounts from a small, predictable loss to a roll of the dice.   If Cyprus did it, then Greece can do it, then another...  Then you have either runs on banks or a shutdown of the banking system.  Capital flight from the Euro to safer currencies.
Also, in direct response to  If the EU had been using a secure currency in the first place, the gov't of Cyprus wouldn't have had all that free money to destroy their economy with, and wouldn't have needed to steal more when they realized they had no more money.
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:54:26
Where would be a good place to read about these kinds of attacks, with background?
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:41:53
Backed by who's gold?  And where do they keep it?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:10:49
Really?  You would prefer that some organization have complete power over and knowledge of your finances, rather than need to keep viruses off your own computer?  To each his own, but I prefer decentralization.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:32:00
ASIC resistance, although it seems good at first, is 1: Impractical and 2: Generally bad anyway.  What you really want, is something so _easy_ to implement in an ASIC that you can buy small, cheap ones to plug into your PC, and the only real cost is the electricity and _cooling_.  Since 2 physically separate machines can more easily get rid of heat, it encourages decentralization.  SHA256 is getting there, slowly.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:39:19
But you see, the possible bankruptcy of the bank would be due to: 1: Fractional reserve, the bank never having enough money to protect their customers. 2: The same people who stole this money having mismanaged the money they stole every year before.  
Also, I doubt that the bank's terms and conditions stated, "We may take your money at any time".
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:58:37
The Bitcoin dev's can't change the mining algo, that would be centralized control.  And all the big players know, that ASIC resistance is a crock and you don't want it anyway.  What we need is for ASICs to become commodity hardware you can buy anywhere, so that everyone can stick a PCI card in their PC and mine p2pool in the background. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:41:19
1: an extremely centralized and vulnerable part of the Bitcoin economy finally died(almost) before they were compromised by data mining. ( as far as we know)
2&amp;3: Badly coded exchanges lost reputation, making sure this issue is well known and will be dealt with in future. 
4a: If it was the bug, see 3.
4b: If they ran off with the money, this will encourage the development of decentralized trading systems, ie OpenTransactions.
So yeah, it's bad in the short term, but this could help solve a lot of future problems.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:08:17
That's the problem, I don't see him doing that.  Unless he figures that's already done anyway?  He never actually said it was Satoshi, but he didn't deny it either.  Most seem to interpret it as a confirmation, but who knows?
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:23:10
That's the thing - I assumed the whole article was bs, until I saw Gavin's tweet.  Or is he helping the real Satoshi by jumping on a red herring?
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:41:28
That depends what country you are in.  A Bitcoin wallet on an average WinPC is still safer than a Cyprus (or insert EU country here)  bank account.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:03:19
Incorrect.  In a communist society, there are no "political elites".  You are thinking of USSR, China, etc, which were/are in fact State Capitalist.  That is, the State owns everything.  A communist society, where wealth is shared equally, does not have a State.
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:56:14
Yes, but then you still have one key difference between capitalism and true communism - starving people unless they produce stuff for you.  Whether this is "fair" or just or more practical,  that becomes the debate.
@_date: 2014-04-29 01:02:47
Miners are nodes, that's not the point.  there are enough miners (if they would all smarten up and mine solo or p2pool).  But the number of nodes that store and relay the blockchain is decreasing, as the blockchain size soars past 20GB.
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:59:11
Right, because the _completely_ closed-source iOS has less backdoors? I doubt that.
EDIT: Any closed source software must be considered backdoored.  If you want a smartphone that is secure, you have to run Replicant.  And even then, your location, calls, and texts, at a minimum, are still an open book.
EDIT2:  I'm not talking just about random crackers stealing your coins through exploits.  There is also the obvious fact that Apple has remote access to all iPhones, just as Samsung Android modems are backdoored unless you run Replicant.
@_date: 2014-02-15 02:20:30
Yes, there is no perfectly safe transaction, because all decisions are made with incomplete information.  However, as much as some frameworks can assist, you ultimately have to weigh risk &amp; reward.  Is it a mistake if, according to all known information, it was a good idea at the time?  That's a philosophical question, really.  True, I should not have said "incompetent", I'm sorry, I was in a hurry.  What I meant to imply was that if your coins are stolen, don't turn to bad ideas like Coin Validation, doxxing, etc.  That is what I thought was meant by "how to deal with coin theft", since it was in the context of the Coin Validation discussion.  Just try to keep your coins safe in the first place.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:23:50
Theft: don't be incompetent and get your coins stolen.  Fraud: see Theft.
@_date: 2014-05-09 03:38:52
I know this is a little more technical, but please add a link to this:
It's by andytoshi (sig is there too), explanation of ASICs and why ASIC resistance is bad.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:29:46
Just from reading the release, I'm guessing it's because the _release text_ was signed, but did not include the signing key, so it doesn't actually affect the software sig.  The easiest attack would be to publish a fake "Andreas Schildbach's GPG key" on lots of keyservers.  Am I close?
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:44:57

A special wallet for when someone is forcing you to give them your money.  He probably wants a second password that unlocks a wallet with less money.

Some people, especially the Chinese miners, say they can't handle 10MB blocks on their internet.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:35:12
The miners can limit the size of the blocks they publish, but not the size they receive.  If they spend a minute downloading a 10MB block before they can start mining on it, that's a huge disadvantage.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:25:33
Well if block size doubles (actual, not limit) then yeah, that's twice the bandwidth costs.  They can already be quite high in some locations.  A concern is that nodes will become limited to countries with fast, cheap internet, which could be bad for security.
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:04:48
Wait, you bought bitcoin in the first place without any idea of how they work?  So that you are surprised by this?  Yeah you should probably get out and go back to shiny rocks.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:03:11
They say it will cause higher bandwidth costs for nodes, which it will, thus causing even less people to run nodes, which it may, which is centralization, which is bad.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:54:54
Problem is, these miners are highly influential in many ways and will resist any attempt to let "market forces" cost them money.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:56:36
Simplicity, presumably.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:03:05


When you are mining, you are already working with your transaction list.  If you find a valid hash, and you add a transaction, it's not valid anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:19:22
Yeah but this can be used to fix the 0-days involved, so it's progress
@_date: 2019-03-30 13:02:11
So what makes cryptocurrencies substitutional goods, that doesn't apply to fiat currency? The fact that they aren't tied to a specific nation / area?
@_date: 2016-01-12 00:08:30
0-conf transactions are primarily important for face-to-face transactions, like buying coffee.  In these cases, time is very much relevant.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:22:14
That just because people are dumb, doesn't mean they couldn't have selected Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:35:18
Both are the same statement; the recommended one just avoids the inevitable question of "what if I can't afford a whole Bitcoin"?. While anyone could make their own blockchain, this does not automatically steal value from other chains. There is a finite supply of Bitcoin; what other currencies do doesn't change that.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:59:10
Yes, but it's not worth burning those backdoors.
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:30:48
The belief of it's users, like most currencies.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:51:32
Lots of people have heard of Bitcoin. They may not understand it, but they know it's been going up.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:25:38
It's funny because you think the only options for the future are 1) government doing everything or 2) ancap (plutocracy).  Rather than, you know, post-scarcity.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:13:59
No, I'm wondering why, when technology has continuously made our lives better in an exponential curve, you somehow find it impossible that it will continue to do so.  Particularly as you type on an electronic device.
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:44:16
This version is better, it says you never have to guess: 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:34:02
More transactions per block, thus hopefully lower fees.

Depending on who you're talking to, FUD has been a common term for years.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:44:07

By what definition of "automation"?  If you mean "there are things that cannot be done by non-sapient entities", sure, probably.  Does a sapient AI count as automation?  I'm not sure, fun question for an endless philosophy argument.
But even ignoring sapient AI, if the only work remaining is this category, I would think that those roles wouldn't be all that annoying - by definition it's a task based on creativity and solving new problems, and with so many other jobs removed there would be no need for long hours.  You could probably find people who would do it out of boredom, or for the social status.  I'd do my current job for free if I only had to do it 10 hours a week and got publicly thanked for it.

My reasoning for the possible unemployment spike (and yes, I should have said "maybe") is that the nature of automation is changing.  In the past, automation has meant machines doing simple work, at greater speeds.  Then computers came along and starting doing brute force calculation at greater speeds.  Always these changes created new, "smarter" jobs that paid better - like my own.  But what if computers because "smart" enough to do those jobs - qualitatively, rather than quantitatively?
Here's a better explanation:

So there isn't actually a limit to how much stuff you can have - you could a have a $10M megahome if you wanted.  It'd be tacky as hell, but it is now.
The difference is that a megacorp or person can't rise in wealth exponentially by just already being rich, buy tons of land and a private army, and become a state in all but name.
Even without such an extreme example, capitalism allows some people to gain power over others, and when that happens, it is abused, no different than a state.  I think preventing that is worth a reduction in total GDP.  Replacing the state with a different hierarchy doesn't help.

Thing is, these post-zeroing data recovery techniques all rely on reading the magnetic platter yourself and reconstructing the data based on the leftover magnetism.  The block device presented to the OS across the SATA connection shows binary, not "0 that used to be a 1".  So you can't recover from a zeroing in software alone; if that were possible that would mean that the bits can't be overwritten and thus the drive can't be written to.
If he, from his perspective, "zeroed" his drive from software, then recovered some of it in software, there are a few realistic possibilities I can think of:
1) Most likely: He actually interrupted the wiping, or had a power flicker or overheat that restarted his PC, and he thought it was done.  I've had multiple power flickers in a month sometimes, and wiping takes hours, so this isn't impossible.
2) Maybe: his wiping software sucked, such as not flushing to disk properly or something.  I've never used it, I dunno.
3) His drive was unreliable and failed to write - I've had that happen, though failing to write 26GB would imply he's going to have noticeable problems *very* soon.
4) He's just plain wrong some way I haven't thought of

Your third link literally says:


And talks about storing files then deleting the partition.
2nd link talks about ntfs undelete, which is a file carver, which also recovers files where the metadata/filesystem no longer refers to them, not things that have been wiped.
Dunno about this Remo tool but seeing as they talk about "Unintentionally hit the format option" it sounds like they are talking about reformatting ntfs over the old one.
So none of these recover data from zeroed drives, which makes sense, because you can't do that without platter access.

51% is actually a tipping point.  See, what we've been calculating is the chance to win the first time - to mine an unbroken chain of blocks greater than the amount needed to confirm, before the rest can.  This is needed because if you have less than 50%, you need your chain to get 1 block ahead, just for a moment, and then it becomes accepted as the legit chain and you aren't fighting the network anymore.  You can't fight the network forever at 25%, you have to get lucky.  But at, say, 60%, you can just keep trying.  Forever.  Legit chain is 100 deep and yours is 99?  Keep working.  Odds say you'll win.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:20:33
Well, mining is a particularly clever solution to some interesting problems.  tl;dr:
1) You need to introduce new currency somehow as the market grows
2) There's no central bank that just makes this free money for themselves - that's the point - so how do you introduce it?
3) A large amount of users need to do a lot of expensive computation - and do it honestly.  That is, it needs to be more profitable to mine honestly than to attack the network.
Therefore, you pay legit miners with the new coins, solving the problems with each other.
As for "bank" websites, well, part of the reason for Bitcoin's existence is to no longer need a bank that controls your money.  You and only you are supposed to control your money.  Exchange websites are useful, but leaving your money in them is foolish and goes against the intended purpose.  Not to mention they were startups in a new tech space - what's the success rate on those? 2%? lol.  Sure enough, some of them imploded in various ways and took people's money with them, because they trusted random Internet startups with their money.  However, it's not the fault of the currency that some companies that worked with it were untrustworthy or poorly run.
As for what you can buy with Bitcoin, I just put $100 CAD into my Steam wallet again.  That's the main way I've been spending it.

Depends.  If all you want to do is mine empty blocks (DOS) then you can disrupt the network by 25%.  Hurts but it's not fatal, and eventually you'll run out of money or lose your control of the stolen pool.
The real threat, both financially and in terms of confidence, is a double-spend large enough to turn heads.  That means you have to mine an alternate block, hold it, make the transaction, have it confirmed by someone else, then release your alternate block.  Without a Sybil attack on the merchant, your block starts from behind and won't be accepted unless you mine another block on top of it first.  Now, you can have a head start like before, so you "only" have to mine 2 blocks in the time everyone else mines 1.  That's what, a 1/16 chance?  But a TX big enough to be worth it won't accept 1 confirm, they'll wait for 6. 0.25^6 = 2.4% ?

When you send coins, they often get sent from multiple addresses, which clearly shows they are part of the same wallet. It takes surprisingly few known points in a social graph to deduce the rest with high accuracy.

A RNG (Random Number Generator) program on a computer is actually a PRNG - Psuedo-Random Number Generator - it can't be truly random.  To generate a private key securely requires a PRNG algorithm that has no flaws, an implementation that has no bugs, and still needs a "random" seed to start the generation.  Dice, on he other hand, are so dirt simple that it's hard to screw up.  You can tell that they are reasonably unbiased by simply holding them.  They also don't block until you move your mouse more :)

Those are an option, but then you are required to trust the website operator to not tamper with the numbers, or record them after  sending.  The whole point of the private key system is that you can generate the keys yourself and be assured that you control your identity.  If you want to be more careful, hashing lots of entropy from different sources can help secure you against the possibility of bad entropy.

Quite right, but you should always put in more entropy than you need to be safe.  A few bits off your key shouldn't be too big a danger, but you can always be careful.  Generating a 256 bit key?  Generate 512 bits and SHA256.  If you have more than 256 bits (50%) entropy in there somewhere, you now have 256 bits of solid entropy.

In theory, yes.  In practice, many times it's been attempted, someone seized power in the name of the people and made it a real dictatorship.

Student here:  I was homeschooled JK - Grade 8, when I came into Grade 9 English (at a really good school too) I was one of maybe 10 students who had read a book outside of school in years.  I had a vocabulary 2x-4x the rest of the students, even the really smart ones.  And I did just fine in all the other subjects too.  
The reason for this is that, since homeschooling can take up less of your day than a formal school, I was often done by 1:00 or 2:00.  I was then encouraged to read and do other educational things until supper, at least.  Homeschooling works when the parent cares about their child's education, and knows that they need to be interested to learn.

Miniblockchain reduces storage space needed by separating the block header and the full block, thus, you keep all the block headers, forming the chain of hashes, but delete the older blocks, keeping only a table of all unspent TXs.  The idea is, you don't need the full TX history, only the knowledge that you did check the full history once, and it's proven by the hash chain.
Zerocoin gives an upgrade to full anonymity by using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing you to totally unlink the sending and receiving addresses of a TX.  Unfortunately, it has high CPU usage, 2 new TX types that need to be added, and thus blockchain bloat.  It either needs an upgrade, or a new version of mini-blockchain so we can affford to use it.

I get what you are trying to build here, and why, and I respect your intent.  But to rephrase this sentence, with coinsignia if you do &lt;anything the government doesn't like&gt;, anyone will be able to contact the local police.  For example, what if you are a political blogger/journalist, and you want to take donations?  
Coinsignia would make sure you are the real blogger, sure, but it would also give away your meatspace ID. 
GPG web-of-trust systems like OTC don't have this weakness.  Sure, the problem with OTC is that people can still choose to defraud you, and maybe not get caught.  But by doing so, they usually have to throw away a valuable account.  The more trustworthy the account's reputation, the more money they might be able to scam in their one shot, but the account is worth more too.
What it all comes down to is:  Centralized solutions are vulnerable.  Decentralized solutions are the only practical option.  Also, tying someone to a meatspace ID in order to be able to "trust" them doesn't really work.  All that means is that you can now threaten violence to a scammer.  The fear of violence isn't trust.  
No system is perfect, but a decentralized system based on building reputation, ie GPG WoT's like OTC, is better than a centralized system reliant on the threat of violence, and inherently vulnerable to violence as a centralized system always is.

Thanks for your response.  Insurance is an interesting idea, but then why not run a conventional escrow service?  Escrow would work similarly in most situations involving Bitcoin, and you put yourself at no risk of loss. (Provided you are always able to determine the truth in a dispute, of course).  Escrow is, I think, more practical than insurance, unless you are dealing with a trade that cannot be easily held in escrow, ie both physical goods that must be shipped.

If you are planning on putting more than a few BTC on a PC, please, use Linux. I suggest Debian for easy security.
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:25:36
Well, many of them are known, have faces, were at conventions.  Not sure exactly how many of them you could prove.
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:46:06
There were about a dozen people at the very beginning, some of whom probably had more fast PCs than Satoshi did.  Could be any one of them.

If you're exchanging large amounts of bitcoin, or making an offline wallet, you should be using an entirely OSS, and stable, linux distro. say debian with no nonfree packages.

Do you run their software in a chroot, and encrypt the data outside of that chroot?  Otherwise you're handing them all the data on the hard drive.

A truecrypt volume is pretty easy to use.  I've shown people how to use it in a few minutes, and if it's their money on the line, they'll listen.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:13:27
OSS does not automatically make you safe, no. But proprietary software automatically makes you unsafe, due to the high risk of back doors.

This might give them an excuse to attack Bitcoin, sure, but if they try to make it illegal, their economy will just miss yet another boat.  And the rest of the world will use it anyway.  Although it would certainly slow down adoption.  EDIT: It's more likely the NSA, etc, would prefer to allow it to run, since lots of people think it's fully anonymous, even though it's not.  Now if zerocoin were added...
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:02:44
It doesn't _have_ to be centralized - what if you make an account at your local grocery store? They debit your account when you buy, and email you a bill every 2 weeks or whatever, which you settle up with 1 transaction. this sort of thing would lower blockchain TXs immensely, without centralization.

Well, in the long run it's wise to secure the network by distributing some units to lots of people.  Otherwise they risk losing everything.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:09:46
Certainly its a hard decision, I also believe this is early adoption. "Adoption" being the key word. I intend to sell some of my BTC by buying things I need with them, so as to help the economy, thus helping the rest grow :)

Thanks for this warning, everybody check for the "Forbes Staff" tag on the author.  Of course its absence doesn't mean its not a good article.

And are you going to open every water bottle and run a chemical test?  Kinda difficult.  Simpler to disallow all water bottles, and sell secure ones inside.  (of course, let's not forget how much they must charge for those licenses :P )
@_date: 2013-09-27 02:56:14
Pretty much, we already have lots of closed-source cloud services.  Why not just run a Sparkleshare server for Bitcoin?  btw I just checked their site, they are accepting bitcoin donations now!

Random != arbitrary. And remember credit cards are "internet points" too

People saw his service, not knowing he was 18.  They trusted him based on what they saw, same as any other service.  He was no more likely to scam or screw up than a 30yo.  pirateat40 anyone?  Don't know about you, but I couldn't care less about him being 40.  Also, lots of people are 18 before graduating, depends on your birthdate. (Canadian here)  It's true, he should have had insurance, but I don't think him being 18 had much to do with that decision.  (Unless he tried but was denied based on his age, which I could see happening)

Not if you make them pay in advance, ie keeping the account "stocked" rather than paying a bill afterwards. Then merchant risk is zero.

Really?  What's the most complicated concept in grade 6 math?  Looking at this first search result, it looks like basic 2D geometry and basic probabilities.  With a teacher's book for a quick review, anyone should be able to teach that.

There are plenty of good guides out there.  No, nobody can just change the protocol. Some minor changes could be made with a consensus, but the fundamentals can't be changed.

any free-market commodity can crash in value do to panic, if people start selling because others are selling, it spirals down.

Because there are clear liquid/gel explosives powerful enough that 500ml could take a plane down if put in the right spot.  Annoying as it is, it makes sense to disallow water bottles.

No, these ASICs can do SHA256 and nothing else.

He did say that was because the sudden attention would hurt Bitcoin.

Awesome, that is great to hear.  Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:29:20
I will start with zerocoin as soon as it's released, because Bitcoin is _not_ anonymous enough.  It is probably the biggest upgrade over Bitcoin of any altcoin, so I think it will be adopted.

How would this arrest allow "them" to go after the currency his trades were conducted in?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:01:29
And these are all great experiments, none of which has proven to be "better" than Bitcoin, or at least not better enough to start taking over.  Now whichever altcoin implements miniblockchain AND zerocoin, (if that's possible) I'm in.
@_date: 2013-08-19 17:30:39
An interesting question.  The ISP would probably say that it is reselling, since they would prefer to forbid it.  Perhaps this would require them to accept Bitcoin as a currency, which would be interesting.

That's how most websites hold bitcoin, so probably yes.  It's possible he transferred some extra out to an offline wallet.  But if they have the server, they have _some_ bitcoins.

She can use Bitpay to avoid any risk.  It's perfectly stable.

Proprietary software automatically has a backdoor risk, and backdoors can be used by more than one person. Also, the simpler the system the less risk, so a light Linux distro is better.  I would go with Debian for max security myself, though I use Arch.

There is always that problem.  And you can always add a third, and a fourth password.

Someone has to use bitcoin if it is to grow - its also a great way to transfer money globally. And remember, the guy who bought that pizza doesn't regret it.
