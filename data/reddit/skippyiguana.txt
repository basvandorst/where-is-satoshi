I have used both in the past with success.  Fees and price are basically a wash.  For buying BTC, Coinbase generally has a more favorable exchange rate, but Circle has no fees -- and in my experience they have always cancelled each other out so you are getting (about) the same "BTC per Dollar" at the end of the transaction.  This is all in general terms and based on my experience, so it is possible that one tends to be cheaper than the other at certain times, so YMMV.
If you get instant buy setup in Coinbase, speed is basically a tie.
IIRC, Circle seemed to ask fewer identity-related questions when I signed up, but I can't remember.  I know I needed to "verify my identity" with Coinbase before I could do any sort of instant buy.  With Coinbase it was obvious I was buying BTC, but Circle was a bit more cryptic as it required me to dig through settings to "switch" my account to buy/sell/send BTC.
If you are allowed to join the Coinbase Exchange (not all US states are eligible), they don't charge a fee for "maker" orders (limit orders that aren't filled immediately), but it also takes 3-5 days to get USD from your bank account into Coinbase Exchange.  Given how much Bitcoin can fluctuate, this can be a blessing or curse depending on what the market does in that time.  There is also the option of doing an instant buy through Circle or Coinbase, then trying to make a trade or two on Coinbase Exchange to "make your fee back".  But as is any type of trading, it's a risk and for smaller amounts of money, the fees of the instant buy purchase aren't significant in terms of absolute USD.

At least one of them accepts Bitcoin directly...
