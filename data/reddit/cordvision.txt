I’m not American. Yes, there are some use cases in places with very unstable currencies. However, I do think it is essential to achieve a high adoption rate in western countries because that is were most the money and trade volume is...

All I’m saying is that we need to think about escrow/purchase protection and storage of private keys. These are issues that might be even more important to solve than just transaction throughput.

I said no incentive for the average Joe.

The average Joe doesn’t have enough money in the bank that he would care...

Defeats the entire point of crypto currency... if everybody stores their keys with a centralized authority it is no different than paypal.

The average Joe is so  irresponsible with his personal finances that he buys a nice car just to show off even if he can’t afford it and it puts him in debt for years...

The 27% off amazon won’t be permanent and most businesses could’t offer such rewards. Your second point is valid and I specifically listed it as a valid point in my original post...

No, it doesn't. It's the same. 1USD costs 1.43 AUD
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:32:31
I never said it has no value. I specifically referred to “mass adoption for daily purchases”!

The overwhelming majority of traders looses money. In the long term, it is almost impossible to beat the market with trading.

I think you are actually required by law to update your address with the DMW... If you don't your ID is technically not valid....
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:18:14
Yes, but getting some temporary discount on amazon his hardly a convincing argument for mass adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:30:15
Obviously a scam....

Not if you live pay check to pay check, as many do. Also, a large part of the population is neck deep in debt...

Yeah, but the average Joe wants purchase protection, cash back rewards, insurance and air miles, and gladly pays 1.5-2% more for those “rewards”. 
I think Visa is reliable enough, and in the rare case it is down I can pay with mastercard...
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:01:57
Please explain why the average Joe cares about any of those points when buying his starbucks coffee? Visa does just fine...
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:33:30
Completely defeats the purpose of crypto currency. At that point it just becomes another “paypal”.
@_date: 2019-11-01 19:18:47
Typical scam... He sends you money (by check, wire transfer etc.) and once you sent him the bitcoin the check will bounce or the transfer turns out fraudulent. Also, this is considered money laundering and is a crime in most places.

TA doesn’t work!
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:02:46
Why would they need to know about your funds? A screenshot showing a balance in some wallet doesn’t do anything since it could be anybodies wallet.  How would they possibly know that you control it. Never ever give them your private keys! Sounds scammy to me...
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:24:19
It's your fault for using a wallet that over charges you. The same as it would be your fault if you buy gasoline at a gas station that charges $15 per gallon.

You said take profit at $10600, it went up to 11780 as of right now. In other words, you lost out on over 1000 dollars of potential profit.... ��

Time to revisit: Wow, your TA was waaaaaaaaayy off, but for some reason I'm not surprised ��

If you sent BTC, you are likely SOL. Yes, it is technically possible to trace your transaction, but even if you know who scammed you, you would still have to take them to court and the win the case and the somehow collect the money... Unlikely to happen... Just my 2 cents
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:06:04
No, it's actually not created yet. It gets created as the miners solve block. The miners actually create new bitcoin with each block they solve.
Knowing the exact percentage point of BTC you own is meaning less and has no practical use...
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:50:50
Unless I'm completely miss informed, you are wrong on this. BTC is actually created by the miner and not just allocated. The miner simply includes a ledger entry in the block that says that his address now owns x amount of bitcoins (x=block reward), thereby creating new bitcoin out of thin air. The other miners/nodes accept this as correct because he solved a block... Therefore BTC is not allocated but created by the miner.

Recovery sites may help you recover a wallet you lost your keys to (like a password protected wallet file that stores your private keys). There is currently no way to revert/recover a btc transaction that has been confirmed several times. After all this one of the main properties of btc.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:55:52
No, don't. It obviously wont....
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:38:13

First you would have to locate them, which is likely to cost you a lot of money. Chances are they are in a foreign country so you would have to find a lawyer that is familiar with that countries legal system. Furthermore, chances are they don’t give a shit about you threatening them. In other words, I think you are SOL. Consider it an expensive lesson...
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:32:39
Anybody can check if those transactions are actually valid or not. It takes a ton of hash power to create valid blocks. You can’t just create  "fake" blocks out of thin air...
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:29:24
You can consider that anything that promises more than 5-8% interest per YEAR and low risk is a scam!

Part of the code is to allow only for 21mio btc to be created but its not like the 21mio btc already exists and then gets allocated. BTC is created with every mined block, basically out of thin air (just like fiat money is printed). The difference is that there is a consensus between the miners that they wont create more than 21mio btc (technically they could, if the majority would agree to it).
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:52:35
What i there is no warning (which would make a ban most effective)? What if notice of a ban is only given a few short weeks a head of time (like when India banned large bills) and you can't transfer your bitcoin because you forgot to file form xyz (there's plenty of people that lost access to their funds for months because of issues like that). What if someone gets access to your account and steals your funds and coinbase claims it is your fault because you didn't protect your password?  What if coinbase gets hacked and it turns out that coinbase was really negligence and the insurance company therefore refuses to pay?

You are welcome. I suggest to spend some time doing google reseach...

Sounds scammy to me.... many people got scammed on Telegram so be aware. Some of the scams are pretty sophisticated and hard to spot. Also, the overwhelming large majority of traders fail to outperform the market.

You assume it will go lower, but it might not. You could be right or you could be wrong. If it just keeps going up from now on, and you decide to buy back in, you have less btc than you started with.  It's very hard to beat the market. The overwhelming majority of traders makes less profit in the long run than the long term investor. This is a fact...
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:22:19
Typical scam: Bank transactions/checks etc are reversable, BTC transactions are not. Scam usually works like this: You will receive money into your account, you then send a large portion of it to some btc address. Later, the original bank transaction gets reversed and you have now a negative account balance. You will be liable for that money. Also, you might get charged with being a money mule.
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:41:00
Could be counterfit, stolen etc. Also, as I said, you could be charged for money mule activity or worse which carries stiff charges in many places including prison time...

If you want to make money you probably shouldn't trade but hodl instead. The large majority of traders can't beat the market in the long run.

There's no such a thing as a safe trade. Even a well established currency like BTC can flashcrash 20+% in seconds...
