 If they have investors on board who plan on buying a significant part of the company, they may be able to repay their customers much quicker than expected.  I've listened to PGP  talk about repayment happening on the order of weeks instead of months or worse.  To be able to say something like that, I think can only mean outside investors.

[Here's the best explanation ever]( courtesy of a post from &gt;Alright here's how it works:    
Basically it only works for bots that have been shadow banned (banned from voting/commenting, but they have no idea they've been banned.) This means the bot can post, upvote and downvote all it wants but it will have no way of telling if it's shadowbanned. In fact, you could be shadowbanned right now and not know it. Until I reply to your comment, then you know you aren't shadow banned. The reason they do this is because if the bot knew it was banned, it would just make a new bot and continue exploiting. This way, the bot will keep doing stupid stuff not knowing it's been banned all along, and no new bot will replace it until it finds out.     


**Edit:** This is also why you see almost perfectly agreeable posts get thousands of downvotes. They aren't real downvotes, they are fuzzed. It might literally have 10 downvotes, but the fuzzing will add a lot more on.    
**Example:** A comment or post with 14572 upvotes and 11442 downvotes could very well be closer to something like 3504 upvotes and 374 downvotes. However, both values still result in the end tally of a total of 3130 up.

Maybe if this was made explicit of the day that they made a big announcement about it I would've been okay with it. Perhaps I would've taken more time to consider which choices to make. The fact that they're bringing this out a day late, on a Sunday night ... it's really disappointing.

1 inch is 2.54mm. Even the United States is familiar with the *milli* prefix. That's as complicated and sciency  as it gets. One conversion rate. I can do a quick calculation between one system and another with it. To quickly determine length. I have no idea if I can afford a cup of coffee with 7000 bits without having to think about it first when another, already existing system is already in place.
What you're asking me and that newbie to do is to add another step take to understand just how much money I'm dealing with.

There are also no instructions on that page.

I waited 19 hours after my first email to them before sending another to ask them what's up. I wasn't going to send my coins to that address unless I knew that we had connected first.

I don't blame you for being timid about trading for the first time. It's not for the faint of heart and you are almost guaranteed to make losing calls if you try to just wing it on an exchange. You're swimming with sharks. 
But selling at a premium to cash customers is a no-brainer unless you happen to get unlucky during large fluctuations.

It has to do with intent. For instance, is an upvote brigade allowed by Reddit, however, hundreds of people we are shadowbanned when someone on 4chan linked to a post here. If that were allowable, the site would break. Someone who is a nuisance is not a ban-able  offense in itself until it crosses a gray line that's determined by the admins. The fact this is something to do with monetary gain makes it even more likely.
The first large tip I made on Twitter, I got spammed by someone following  A relatively new account and those were his only comments over and over.  I blocked and reported him for spam. Shit like that got and being altogether banned from other subreddits.
Other bots have been shadowbanned, you just don't realize it.
@_date: 2014-11-22 18:57:45
I wouldn't be concerned unless tipping becomes the only thing you do, it crosses the line between being generous and promoting ChangeTip.com. There's a link somewhere with the list of tipping-friendly subreddits. I'd stick to that and ask moderators if it's okay in new subs that may not of seen it before. A lot of mods are not friendly towards bots and some feel that the tipping is just a way to promote bitcoin in self-serving way that disrupts normal conversation. That's how they felt in we are tipping is now not allowed. I think if you're polite, take the time to explain tipping and tip generously yet in moderation, you'll have better results. Use $'s and not the silly words and the misunderstood 'bits' in non-bitcoin subs.

If it's unwanted/a nuisance and he's mass PMing, just a few reports would bring it to an end. This is especially true when money making/paying Redditors to do something on Reddit is involved. Not all the reasons for a shadowban are spelled out explicitly and it's up to the discretion of the particular admin who reads the reports.
One possible interpretation: self promotion.


*You may never offer money or compensation to anyone to promote anything on reddit for you*. Things should be submitted on reddit by redditors who have found your content organically and submitted it because they found it interesting. You should never run a contest to see "who can get a link highest on reddit" or ask anyone to submit links on your behalf.

Take your pick from One that I would recommend to someone brand-new would be the one from Hive for its simplicity and overall ease-of-use. My personal favorite is Electrum mainly because you can restore the wallet anywhere from a seed phrase. However, that can also be done using the one from Greenaddress.it which has apps for the iPad, iPhone, Android and is able to sweep private keys/QR codes from paper wallets and I'm completely in love with it too. Armory would be the next one on my list.

Coinbase is the best place to begin, though you may be paying a little extra for the convenience. There's always also going to be a delay b/c you have to become verified in order to buy at any online exchange. Shop and compare face-to-face cash transactions on localbitcoins as that may be your cheapest and fastest way to get your coins.

I don't know if I'd leave it unattended but it can be bolted down to the countertop in a store. Overnight, just take out the cash and leave the lid open so no one thinks that it's of much value. You have to put a big sticker on it saying "there are no bitcoins *in the machine*, duh." Otherwise, idiots would run off with it thinking they got someone's private keys.
In the second video, the guy opens it up with the key and it looks like it's pretty solid but it wouldn't last long with time and a crowbar. Someone could just punch through the front of the android screen anyway.

You will be told that paper wallets are the most secure form of cold storage which is true. However, if you spend from the paper wallet, i.e., you sweep the coins from the paper wallet onto a computer or phone by scanning the QR code, you should sweep the *entire amount*. Some applications don't play nice with paper wallets and any funds that you don't spend get sent back to what's called a change address where retrieval might be impossible for the average user.
Anyone using paper wallets for storage should read [this thread](

I suppose it's because they're looking for particular pattern. They must have hundreds of thousands of transactions to do statistical analysis on and shoot for the most likely targets. Somebody in Vegas that wins $12,000 every month and sends the whole amount honestly and in the open is not targeted. But somebody that wins $100,000 and deposits $9,500 every two weeks is a would be.
You got to admit that breaking large amounts in the smaller ones *regularly* or in a pattern that an algorithm might catch is asking for it I guess. The fact that just being suspicious is not illegal but they can grab your funds anyway and proving that you're not freaking any laws is more expensive than just settling in giving them the money is complete bullshit in tantamount to extortion. *It's a racket.*

The explanation is actually simpler than that. If you're at all familiar with 4chan, they started promoting a bypass to their comment captcha for $20/yr. So when they started accepting bitcoin payments, the announcement said, "We *buttcoin* now." I thought that would be easy enough to remember… people just try it sometimes like I did when I created it, I think.

Thank you. My advice has gotten over [80 legitimate users unbanned]( in the last couple of months.
Keep in mind, though, that if it weren't for shadowbans, this place would be overrun with spam to the likes that you can't imagine. Everyone would go back to Digg. Even 4chan bans spammers but they at least tell you about it.
Having been banned myself once (twice if you count one of my alts), hence the meaning behind my username, I decided to take up the good fight and help those who didn't deserve theirs either. It's an awful predicament to be in if you value, not just your imaginary points, but your identity on Reddit.

Great idea and I subscribed but, as mod of I'd like to offer the following advice especially for relatively new accounts with not a lot of history:
Within the rules of Reddit there's the [often overlooked section on spam]( Even more overlooked is the subsection on [self-promotion](
Note that linking too often to a site where you might personally gain, whether it's your own or someone else's, could get you shadowbanned. The rule of thumb is to avoid exceeding a **borderline** ratio of 1:10 when it comes to referring to outside links vs typical posts and comments. 
Not only can someone report you as a spammer on Reddit's algorithm will also do it too if you exceed their undefined threshold.
I certainly don't mean to be a wet blanket, but if someone begins posting lots of links of products for sale too much, [they'll risk vanishing with no warning](and this really bums me out when it happens to regular people and not actual spammers.
Best practice: Avoid posting links to just a single source. Mix it up with several different ones and make plenty of comments that don't include links at all on others' posts.
Best of luck on the success of your new sub, OP.

Nope. Those are public keys. Just like coinbase gives you their public-key to deposit bitcoins into your account, when you withdraw to your desktop wallet, you give coinbase your public-key.  In desktop wallets and even the Blockchain Web wallet, you're in control of the private keys even though you don't normally see them out in the open when sending/spending your coins; it's done in the background.
I just now [generated this paper wallet]( on 
The difference between the public key on the left, which you would use to deposit bitcoins onto the wallet, is now obvious compared to the private key on the right which you would use to import into a desktop wallet or blockchain.info.
This is besides the point, but some beautiful examples of paper wallets and how their public and private keys are displayed can be found here: 
Coinbase has your private keys, and you're at their mercy for them to to send you your coins when you request them.

**BFL** verb
1. To have something you ordered - delivered so far behind schedule, that it is no longer useful to you. Especially in cases where delays are 100+ days and the manufacturer or reseller is refusing to offer a refund for the goods. 
2. Scammed 
3. Completely fucked over
The term originates from the famous case in the Bitcoin community of longer than 1 year backlog of orders at Butterfly Labs, who have refused to refund their customers.
Usage:     
*Damn, I think we're getting BFL'd*
*Be careful, you might get BFL'd*

We're already used to SI prefixes and I much prefer using mBTC to bits. At a glance, I know whether a cup of coffee priced in millibitcoins is a value compared to the one priced in my familiar local fiat currency or if it's overpriced.

Fit me for my tinfoil hat but wouldn't an adversary of bitcoin, say the PBOC, find it well within their means to push it this far and further? Regular miners brought it to 41% and then this adversary only has to add a little extra ghash. As well-meaning miners leave the pool, this adversary picks up the slack. 
Using the PBOC is just an example of a wealthy enough individual or group who might not give a shit if they ruin what they've mined.

I found it helpful to distinguish *Bitcoin Technology* from *bitcoin,* the part attached to the price — it makes it easier to steer away from the areas that rustle peoples jimmies (cost, hacking, theft, tulips, etc.) When doubts inevitably come up , I say, "I know how you feel. I felt the same way but I've found...," and answer the question then redirect the conversation to first how and why Bitcoin works. The revolutionary parts are fascinating. Remittances are much more compelling than a small discount at electronics retailers.
As you feel you're nearing a jimmie subject that needs to be touched, like wallet security, you have the upper hand in the conversation and can direct it positively. Explaining wallet security is much easier when you're not starting out by defending an objection.
Always offer free bits to experiment with if anyone shows interest in starting their own wallet. Practice a transaction with them too.

A bona fide, site-wide shadowban is either done manually by the admins after a violation is reported to them or by a Reddit algo when it picks up certain activities like spamming a particular domain or vote brigading. You can never be certain what all the triggers are; they're kept secret to keep abusers from learning how to avoid them. I would imagine being banned from multiple subreddits would bring extra scrutiny. Realize that there's two ways to be banned from individual subreddits:
1. The official subreddit ban where you get notified and mods can put a certain time limit on it.
2. The unofficial 'shadowban' by use of Hope that helps explain things.

Bitcoin days destroyed is calculated by multiplying the number of coins by the number of days since they last moved (spent). A small amount of very old coins from 2009 *(edit. and stored without being spent)* have much more weight in the equation than a lot of coins that were made last week.

I know exactly how you feel and I'm perfectly happy with Electrum. 
For Bitcoin to go mainstream, it needs more (I hate the term) "apps" for everyday folk to use that holds their hand for them. For instance, this one automatically makes backups. Hopefully it helps lessen the fear of wallet mistakes for new adopters.
~~I haven't tested it out myself, but I plan to to see if it's something I would recommend to a friend.~~
edit. Having installed it, I find it dead simple. Not quite sure how I feel about the option to back it up to dropbox but it's better than nothing if you don't have an external backup hooked up (there is an option to back up with Time Machine).
So far, I feel a lot better recommending this to a friend who's casually interested in bitcoin rather than holding their hand through some of the others or the risks of a web wallet.

People who are good at it and know what they're doing can feed their families daytrading but you're right in saying that it's not for just anyone to simply pick up and try.
Losing even 50% of the time is fine if you're set ups involve payouts that are greater than 2:1 *and* you know how to exercise proper risk management. At worst you come out scratch… Next bus in 20 minutes.
My point is that regular people get scared and sell their precious coins to someone cheap only to get excited and buy them back at twice the cost later, often with money they can't afford to lose.

Agreed, however having a beginners knowledge of what an dire looking chart pattern resembles is important. A double top/double bottom is probably the most recognized by even a beginner (except the for people who were buying over $900 after it confirmed and who will be selling when we close in on $200). Regardless of anyone's beliefs about how important blockchain tech is to the future still, you can't afford to make huge mistakes with your weekly paycheck and buy the top and sell the bottom.
Definitely stay away from margin trading if you're not *thoroughly comfortable* with technical analysis.

The difference is Coinbase is more like a retail outlet for btc. It has limitations on the amount you can buy/sell and is slow compared to an exchange like Bitfinex, OKCoin, etc., which  have lower fees and the benefit of speed, attractive to people who are dealing with larger volume and frequency. Traders, basically, who don't mind KYC/AML can sleep a little better knowing their cash wont disappear overnight without recourse. 
This is a huge step in the right direction which will help put shady exchanges out of business. The Wildwest is getting tamer and more attractive to mom and pop investor. This is good press for Bitcoin in general.

I think the future of mining we've only just begun to fathom right now.  Satoshi didn't anticipate centralized asic farms.  Maybe the only 'profitable' miner in the future will be those running in our toasters  which will help to slightly offset our electric bill.  I think we'll look back at the $10,000 mining machines  of today the way we look back at $250 floppy right drives.

 I believe it's OK *as it exists today* but if you want it to be your main wallet for the foreseeable future, you want something that's being actively developed especially in light of the fact that wallets will need to be updated to accommodate forks.  If your intent is to run a full node, I would recommend Core or do your own diligence to see if Multibit  is still reliable.  If you're OK with a SPV light client, I strongly recommend Electrum for the desktop and Copay for mobile.

Perhaps. Like I said, a lot of it depends. It comes down to the whims of a  prosecutor and the political climate  at the time. Involve two countries that share a good relationship and *the possibility* of recovering a portion of the funds isn't zero. It's worth pursuing to a degree.

That's because you don't report your friends to credit agencies when they're late/default.
Back in the day, I used to lend on  which was also a mixed bag. If you're too conservative, your profits were very small; too aggressive and you didn't see any profits. But at least there were people that would buy defaulted loans from you who are willing to wait for the deadbeats to eventually try to straighten things out with their credit. Not sure how well this works with bitcoin. The price is just not stable enough to warrant months of waiting. Borrow it when it's expensive, pay it back when it's cheap.

But then, as a $ lender, you would be compelled to submit to your local taxing authorities. As a pure btc lender (and I may be misunderstanding the reporting practices of btcjam, etc.,) not having that *technical* burden is attractive. Maybe enough so to warrant a little extra risk. Dunno. I read too many prospects that were for trading or to buy a miner. Most people have no business borrowing money for either of those when 90% of traders lose their initial stake and ROI is so low for hobbyist miners. Bad news for the lender, mostly. Someday, when there's more outlets to spend BTC on, say, your brick and mortar store's utility bills, things will be better. Money and people suck.

The coins are placed in escrow until the seller confirms that the products from Amazon have arrived then the coins get released to you. Afterwards, buyer and seller rate each other so there's at least a functional reputation system.

I respect your commitment and admire your outlook but 90%, man. Just keep in mind that that violent $165 spike downwards is going to be tested. For us to have a sustained bull market, we need a firm floor. A shallow, boring, saucer shaped bowl or **W** shape from which to rise. I, like you, believe strongly in the fundamental story behind Bitcoin. The *technical* side of its price is frightening. To come out smelling like a rose years from now, long-term investors need to come to terms with both the fundamental and technical aspects. Naïve investors will be taken advantage of. Remember the Dogecoin investors dumping at 35 satoshis and coming to this sub claiming being in Dogecoins had  been a mistake? Don't become one of those. 
I have no doubt Bitcoin is here to stay and will transform the future in ways we can only try to imagine. Just keep your head on your shoulders and drink the Kool-Aid only after you've seen other people do it and live to tell the story. Good luck to both of us.

People who love to trade Bitcoin do so because of the volatility. Traders provide liquidity in the market. When a market becomes stable (pick an altcoin that's been flat for weeks, for example) they move their money elsewhere where the prices are going up and down and they can make money quicker.
The downside is Joe Sixpack and merchants don't like the volatility and dont want keep money in something so unpredictable. It's ironic that people still think that gold is a store of value when it too is wildly volatile.

Home recording was destined to be in everyone's reach back when VHS and Beta formats were battling for marketshare. The consoles weighed 35 lbs and the four head VCR it was over $700. It turns out that investing your life savings in a VCR repair business wasn't the best idea after all. In a word: timing.
I got started in bitcoin when the price was  $7. I've read other posts where people say they don't mind buying at this price (~$250) even if the price drops to $100. That's fine by them. Keep in mind that it may very well get that low and take months or years to recover to levels near where we are now. 90% investment in a sustained bear market is not prudent, no matter how sound the fundamentals of Bitcoin happen to be. Don't let me dissuade you but make sure that your safety net is in place should the market in the next couple of years disappoint you. If you had gotten started when the price was over $1000, you would have a different perspective on today.

The Ministry of Finance has prepared a draft law providing penalties for the production and trafficking cryptocurrency
Finance Ministry proposes to plant for four years for Bitcoin

The Ministry of Finance has tightened approach to punishment for the production and trafficking cryptocurrency. Anton Siluanova Office has developed amendments to the Criminal Code, under which offenders would be jailed for four years. Earlier, the Ministry of Finance offered a lighter sentence for the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrency - a fine of up to 500 thousand. Rubles, or correctional labor for up to two years. This "News" told in the press service of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Economic Development, which supports this initiative, noted that the bill will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the Government to the State Duma in the coming months.
In late September, the Ministry of Finance proposed to introduce criminal penalties for the production and trafficking cryptocurrency in Russia, considering them money substitutes (prohibited by law "On the Central Bank"). Criminal proposed add a new article "The turnover of money substitutes": in the manufacture, acquisition cryptocurrency the purpose of sale, as well as sales of the Ministry of Finance proposed a fine of 500 thousand. Rubles or the salary and other income for the period to two years, community service up 480 hours, or correctional labor for up to two years. Office clearly drifted to the Bitcoin monetary surrogates, identifying their turnover illegal financial operations. 
According to a source at the Finance Ministry, now the issue of punishment for Bitcoins decided to tighten.
Perhaps this decision prompted the agency plans to produce cryptocurrency companies. Qiwi September 2015 announced the development of its counterpart Bitcoin - bitrubley. As told "Izvestia", the press service of the company, it is expected that in 2016 bitrublyami can pay for the services (eg, mobile communications) through Qiwi-purse. CEO and co-owner Sergei SOLONIN said that when you start to use kriptotehnologiya blockchain, in which the system works Bitcoin.
Representatives of the Central Bank in the past year indicated that believe Bitcoin money substitutes. But this summer, the first deputy chairman Georgi Luntovsky declared that "it is impossible to deny this tool, it is possible for him the future." And in September 2015 deputy chairman Olga Skorobogatov said at a forum in Kazan, the regulator has established a working group to study the technology blockchain based on international experience. Perhaps the Central Bank showed great loyalty to Bitcoins after in 2015 the Bank of England announced plans to create its own digital currency Bitcoin and compared the occurrence of the birth of the Internet.
But cryptocurrency act strongly against the security forces, for example, the Federal Service for Drug Control (FDCS) stated that Bitcoins among other payment systems are actively used by drug trafficking in the drug trade. As noted by representatives of the service, Federal Drug Control Service's position on this issue has not changed. Against cryptocurrency act Prosecutor General's Office, Interior Ministry and FSB.
In 2014 its intention to introduce penalties for the use of cryptocurrency stated deputies from the "Fair Russia".
- Cryptocurrency jeopardize financial stability and fiscal sovereignty of Russia, - says Duma deputy Andrei Krutov. - Have enough uncertainty in the market and it is not necessary to using such a situation, people were trying to save money in Bitcoin, and then turned into deceived depositors. We have developed a bill to impose liability for use cryptocurrency, and the other day he will be formally submitted to the Duma.
A source close to the Central Bank, said "Izvestia" that the final position of the Central Bank will become clear from the analysis of the functioning of the working group cryptocurrency Central Bank, in the study of this issue is involved Rosfinmonitoring. Close to the agency source said that an increased risk of trafficking cryptocurrency points FATF (the international Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering - Financial Action Task Force, which is a party, and Russia). According to the source, FATF considers that the main risks are related to the anonymity of transactions cryptocurrency. The source said that in all recent reports FATF says about this issue.
Among the opponents cryptocurrency and Economic Development.
- By monetary surrogates, including cryptocurrency, no software and is legally bound by them actors - he told "Izvestia" Elena Lashkina, Assistant Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev. - Operations on them are speculative in nature, are carried out on the so-called "virtual stock exchanges" and carry a high risk of significant changes in value. The use of surrogates, including cryptocurrency, associated with a high level of risk, primarily due to their unsecured assets, lack of uniform regulation of release and is legally bound by them subject. The anonymous nature of the production of money substitutes, including cryptocurrency, unlimited range of actors creates the preconditions for involving citizens and companies in the illegal activity, including the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing.
Elena Lashkina added that the use of money surrogates, including cryptocurrency, as a means of payment and savings may infringe the rights involved in their turnover conscientious individuals as holders of money substitutes because of their anonymity and virtuality are unable to defend their interests in judicial or administrative proceedings .
Chairman of the board of the agency "Financial Innovations" Roman Prokhorov (previously headed the department of the national payment system of the Central Bank) said that the only chance for the legal circulation cryptocurrency in Russia - the establishment of clear rules for their treatment with the elimination of anonymity.
- But if you bring your rules for handling cryptocurrency to regulation of existing tools, it eliminates the significant benefits cryptocurrency as a convenient tool for users, - says Roman Prokhorov.
The deputy chairman of the National Council of Financial Market Alexander Naumov confident that the risks of using cryptocurrency in illegal operations is much higher when they are banned than it in exchange for a limited ability to use Bitcoins state can gain control of the transaction. He believes that the limited resolution cryptocurrency in Russia will reduce the risks of serious crimes related to their use.
But the chief analyst Natalia Shilov Binbanka warns that actually cryptocurrency not provided nothing at all (no gold reserves, nor of the economy given country), that is, can grow into a classic pyramid, without any responsibility for it on the part of the creators.
According to the lawyer, Nina Eremina, taking into account the positions of participating in the discussion of government agencies chances of adoption of the amendments the Ministry of Finance are high.
- It must be emphasized that the ban on direct appeal cryptocurrency, production of which is produced in Russia, the law on the Central Bank does not set - like a senior lawyer of "Yukov and Partners" Irina Adamova. - Before the corresponding changes for the criminalization of trafficking cryptocurrency seems premature. Violators should be punished according to the article. 174 of the Criminal Code ("Legalization (laundering) of money or other property acquired by other persons by criminal means").

Depression and anxiety will do that to a fella.
Returning home from work one day, on a rare occasion that I was having one of those awesome days, I opened my mail to find a letter from three attorneys. Having reason to believe that I was being sued or pursued by a collection agency, my heart sank and my day was ruined.
I opened it to find that it was one of those invitations to "private sales event" and a local Hyundai dealership.
Long story short, I chewed the sales manager's ass for using such an underhanded marketing ploy to try and sell cars.

I plan on getting written confirmation from someone higher up in the food chain than the person responding to my hurry.
From the time delay in them answering I inferred that they looked into it a bit and basically said, if it's not gambling/illegal, we're okay with it.
Nothing says, though, that an internal memo from higher up doesn't get sent out a week from now saying that they disapprove of this.
 It's at that point that I would expect communication like, "We're no longer permitting money transfers of that sort any longer…"

I believe it is this logic that is contributing to the decline of ASICMINER-PT share price lately. At first I was hot to get a miner but I didn't have the funds to get more than just a few GHs. After doing the math, it just didn't make sense to spend many thousands of dollars on a machine that will never pay for itself. So instead I invested in stock. Since then it's doubled but it's on a steady decline now. Us small-time guys are finding out that buying the minimum amount of hashing power isn't worth it. Maybe soon some corporate interests will get interested in purchasing terrahash amounts of chips… That'll be a good day for the stock.

It's what I first cut my teeth on when first introduced to bitcoin.  I know how to use it and back it up properly. It's a nice, comfortable feeling not worrying about every step you make around a new client (brain wallets, etc., scared the shit out of me) so I stick with b-qt. 
I also have a distaste for keeping my investment on someone else's server. The US doesn't have to make a law against bitcoin to attack it, all it would take would be for DHS to claim that Slovenia is harboring enemy combatants therefore, yada yada yada…

It's not necessarily many wallets, but using a *new address* for each new transaction rather than using the same one over and over again that helps protect your anonymity.
Storing your coins on several different wallets, or types of wallets, helps protect from losing your investment just as you don't carry all your eggs in one basket.
For example, you might keep .02 BTC for tipping on Reddit, .2 on blockchain for portability and quick spending, 5-10 on your computer or an exchange ready to go for trading and 100 coins on a paper wallet stored in a bank vault for long-term safekeeping.
For sure, you don't want someone you're going to meet up to sell a couple coins to know that you store $10,000 worth of btc on your iPhone when you go to meet them.

The only issue I have with it personally is:
1. Now that I've posted something here about belonging to the credit union, contributing on your site would make me more easily doxxed.
2. My credit union only serves the county in which live so probably 10 or 15 bitcoin users.
Good idea though.

That's the thing though. Cutting expenses and middlemen and making banking more accessible to the smaller entrepreneur. I can fathom seeing smaller institutions popping up that are now able to afford to get into the lending business this way.  That's the "flipping shit" scenario I had in my mind. More competition for the big boys.

I believe that's true but they're also never going to make a profit from me if they cause me to give up trying in frustration. I made many attempts to buy in all kinds of different market conditions, they couldn't all be unprofitable positions for them.

What kind of deposit methods did you allow your buyers to use? All methods, cash and electronic? I'm thinking about pulling the trigger on selling through localbitcoins  and am concerned about allowing electronic transfers for this very reason.

I agree that "hacked" was a poor choice of words. More accurately, transactions reported as fraudulent associated with your account. But it could be anyone, even a long-time customer of the bank who decides that today's the day to log on to their account using TOR, etc., etc.

Hopefully they do it just like we should be doing it; the bulk of deposits being stored off-line with multiple backups stored someplace secure with a daily operating balance online available for withdrawal. Pretty much the way a regular bank handles cash; 95% in a vault and 5% at the tellers' windows.
This question *has* to be answered by that bank for sure but don't expect any details.

Yeah, I saw that but it didn't really clear things up for me. It's nicely produced, slick but too entry-level. I was hoping for it to walk through a transaction. I kind of understand how it could represent something like stock but when they glossed over a house or car, it completely lost me.

My comments have to be taken knowing that I'm speaking as an investor.
That being said, I was riding the fence between investing in shares or buying a Blade myself and joining a pool. With what I'm willing to invest, I would only be able to buy a single Blade. As more asics get shipped, buying confidence will go up and difficulty will increase exponentially. My single blade may never reach ROI and Whether or not it did, I would be left with not much resale value.
If my logic is wrong, I would hope that somebody would convince me otherwise.
