continuing to prove my point........ 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:52:16
bitcoin scales perfectly on chain with bigger blocks...
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:09:32
Not FUD, a bitcoin user that doesn't want to pay 40$ transaction fees. The only people spreading FUD are the users encouraging this retarded behavior like yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:22:37
You're going full on potato. I'm aware that satoshi discussed using "Alt coins" (not what I would call them in the context he described them) but that's completely irrelevant to bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:57:23
There are no spam attacks on the network. Instead oy paying 40$ you will spend 20$. Instead of waiting an hour you will wait 30 minutes. This fixes nothing
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:42:36
todays average fee $24, don't worry we will be back over $40+ soon. 
This isn't FUD, this is the sad reality of bitcoin. You must not use bitcoin for everyday transactions or you wouldn't be sitting here arguing with me about transaction price. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:32:56
It does not need to create a new coin if there's majority consensus. 
Still waiting for your quote.  
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:27:50
segwit won't get us low fees 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:19:13
being so brainwashed by blockstream that you refer to it as bcash. A word that suits you well would be "retard"
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:38:33
They don't vilify it. They don't believe resorting to only the LN for scaling is a good idea. Bitcoin cash developers have said they are open to second layer solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:18:08
So you say satoshi said himself that bitcoin is not supposed to scale through bigger blocks. 
Your argument for that is he mentioned using alternatives chains (coins) as one of the scaling solutions. 
That right there is a straw men argument. How do you dress yourself with such a low IQ?
No one except for you has ever argued that Satoshi was against bigger blocks. Blockstream shills argue that Satoshi was wrong about bigger blocks but not that he was against him. I've provided you proof that Satoshi supported bigger blocks. You can't find a single quote by him saying otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:40:18
and the discussion (if you can even call it that) here doesn't? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:57:12
with the 1mb block it's like 1 string of cable on the Ethernet. For people to use lightning they need to transfer funds from mainnet to lightening. This will not be possible with current congestion. The lightning network will not be enough to remove the congestion. Bigger blocks are required.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:41:36
lightning network developers themselves said that blocks would need to be 100 mb+ for lightning network adoption 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:29:41
If everyone were to use it: 50% max, it doesn't solve the problem 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:04:10
If you want to call cheap transaction "spam" then sure. LOL
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:03:26
wut, developers have posted on the other subreddit multiple times they are open to the lightning network and second layer solutions. No one complained since the first layer will still be usable. With bitcoin the first layer is unusable and as a result will force everyone to use the second layer solution to do transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:53:09
Adoption is not increasing, it's decreasing 
With 100% segwit adoption fees would still be too high 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:01:52
there users ability to run a node does ≠ decentralization. Miner node decentralization is crucial not your useless none mining node. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:02:47
Provide a quote in which satoshi says a blocksize increase is the wrong way to scale. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:16:50
LOOL, segwit adoption hasn't been increasing  
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:13:30
You're forgetting that 1mb blocks sizes were an arbitrary number Satoshi chose to prevent spam at the beginning. Originally it was built to have 32 mb blocks. With block size increases alone bitcoin can scale with sub penny transaction fees. You're entire argument isn't even relevant to why users would currently choose to pay 40$+ for bitcoin fees rather then sub penny fees for bitcoin cash. 


No that's not how it was intended to work. If a lesser valued coin with a low use case is used as an alternative for transaction it won't be a low value/unused coin anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:20:18
I am aware of channel factories. They have nothing to do with my point. Transactions will still occur on the main chain. The lightning network will help ease off some of those transaction but the main chain will remain congested especially with more adoption 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:36:55
what does this have to do with Satoshis nonexistent quote in regards to not supporting bigger blocks? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:04:51
If you want to call cheap transaction "spam" then sure. LOL
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:55:26
it wouldn't, the network would still be clogged and fees would still be high. Why do you think no one is adopting segwit? Too much work for little reward.
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:47:59
you're telling me users would rather pay 40$+ in fees rather then sub penny fees? hmmmm
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:09:06
you're pathetic, you try to make up a bullshit fact and then try to argue you can't provide a source because you don't want to waste time finding it. stop spreading FUD
Here's a quote in which satoshi is explaining how block size can be increased: 
satoshi NEVER said that a blocksize increase isn't a valid scaling solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:18:36
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:00:24


No you don't, you know how to make it work better for private corporations to profit off of it (blockstream). The fact that you said you arn't legally allowed to say why means you work for a private cooperation. The reason satoshi didn't push for blocksize upgrades when he was around was because it wasn't needed until a year a go. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:27:37
You don't even understand how bitcoin works. Hard forks do not equal a new coin. Bitcoin has been forked many times in the past. 
And again how's this relevant to Satoshi? Every post you make is a straw men pushing further and further away from the original argument. I'm still waiting for that quote 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:08:39


I didn't make a comparison between them in my posts. We can argue about blockstreams control over core and how they benefit with limiting the block size if you want....


I didn't mention the lighting network in any of my comments. I can argue with you the problems the lightning network will face if there isn't a blocksize increase....


Businesses are dropping bitcoin. More and more businesses are switching to BCH, the latest big one is purse. This looks like healthy growth:


no 


Bitcoin cash developers are open to second layer scaling solutions. There have been papers done to show 8mb blocks are safe and they are working on increasing it further. As of now a blocksize increase is short term/long term scaling solution that works unlike segwit and lightning. Miners receive the fees they should be from each block. If this is what you're concerned with. Then you should be concerned with the lightning network taking fees from miners........
I have kept both BTC and BCH so it's in my best interest for both to succeed but btc is turning to shit now. 
Having such hatred shows you either invested recently or you fell for the blockstream propaganda campaign and sold all of your bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:58:05
You made practically no arguments. LOL


We should keep transactions fees/times ridiculously high because when you bought your miner you were under the impression you can extort users out of their btc with the current transaction rates? 
You do realize if the price to send bitcoin was cheaper there would be more users and transactions so the miner reward would be pretty similar? With the lightning network it's directly taking transactions and fees away from the miners (this is your concern not mine)
You're truly retarded buying a miner to mine bitcoin and hoping to profit well. LOL at you. 


It's open source. You know what lightning network will work well with? Big blocks.
I feel like your so upset because you sold off your bitcoin cash and now you are legitimately worried it might overtake bitcoin at this rate. If you truly believed bitcoin cash was so bad you wouldn't be sitting here complaining because it would disappear on it's own without damaging bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:16:46
I used to use bitcoin everyday until the transaction cost got higher then the goods i was actually paying for. I've been forced to use other crypto currencies. Bitcoin is losing due to transaction fees and times. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:13:51
you're a retard, you're trying to argue satoshi said a blocksize increase isn't a valid scaling solution by saying he discussed making new coins. You do understand these are not mutually exclusive? Just because he supports one scaling solution doesn't mean he doesn't support the other? 
I can find numerous quotes of satoshi discussing a blocksize increase. Go find me one quote in which he says it's the wrong thing to do. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:26:54
by only 50%. So it fixes nothing 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:05:04
lmfao, you can't provide a quote because he never said it in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:52:51
This isn't bitcoin cash bots. It's users sick of paying high bitcoin fees.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:06:48
the original bitcoin network is mainnet. Lightning is second layer 
You are so misinformed on these topics yet you go around shit posting about them. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:51:48
"Users need to run their own node to keep bitcoin decentralized"
Blockstream (bitcoin core)
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:52:44
the larger the block size the more energy efficient it is 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:57:27
sorry to break it to you but u/_professorcrypto_ is correct and knows what a node does. Nodes are absolutely useless for validating the network. They rebroadcast what the miners give them . How does that help keep the network decentralized? 
Minder node decentralization is all the matters
