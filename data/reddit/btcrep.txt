Litecoin also has much faster confirmations, which is a BIG plus for people contemplating doing face to face transactions. Too many people overlook that with Bitcoin and say "for a small amount, 0 confirmations poses only a small risk". Which is false - 0 confirmations means you have no idea if the persons payment to you was any good until they're long gone. So, Litecoin speeding up the confirmation process is a huge plus.

It would likely be more economical to 51% the network (or 80%, for that matter) than to attempt to buy up all the Bitcoins. An adversary thats intent on doing that would soon become apparent and prices would skyrocket as people realized that there was a buyer out there willing to purchase Bitcoins regardless of the price.

You can keep your cash at home if you'd like right now.
And in todays zero interest rate environment, the incentive for banking isn't so great except that it's almost impossible to exist without a bank account.
But stepping back to more "normal" times - people have the choice of keeping their money under their mattress and earning zero, or depositing it at the bank and being paid 4 or 5% for doing so, understanding that the bank will be loaning out those funds to others.
There's nothing about bitcoin that would stop banking from occuring in that realm. So long as people want to purchase things that cost more than they can afford, there will always be a demand for credit. And the time tested way to provide that credit is offer people some return in order to pool together and spread the risk. That's banking. Bitcoin won't change that.
It's just like people complaing about US Government debt and demanding a return to the gold standard - they're not realizing that doing so without changing our attitudes, and yes, they are our attitudes, would just mean that the government would be borrowing gold rather than dollars.
Changing the underlying currency has no effect on the rest of the system, if people demand the perks of that system.

Why would changing the proof of work to, say, scrypt, piss off the entire community? I understand that it would piss off the ASIC players, but the rest of the mining community would have no problem adjusting it.

If we're content being players in a system that's dominated by a single large corporation, what do we need Bitcoin for at all, then? We've already got the dollar and Federal Reserve. To me, the promise of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized, peer-to-peer. That there were many mining pools competing with one another was great - for too many people, mining their own blocks is simply unfeasible, so concentrating into groups (mining pools) in order to make mine blocks in a timely manner was ideal. But we're fast reaching the end of that - I really wonder what hte mining network will look like a year from now or two years from now.

Are you saying that Avalon built their own foundry? Absurd. Just as speculating that an attacker would attempt to do so with GPU's - if they know enough about Bitcoin to want to try to takeover/shutdown the network, they also know that GPU's have been eclipsed in performance.
Lets find out how much Avalon has spent/invested, and scale that up to 51% of the network hashing power. My bet is that it's going to be a lot cheaper than anyone here thinks.
For instance, according to Blockchain.info, the total network hashrate is 90,000 GH/s.
If Bitforce SC was a shipping product, it would cost $2500 for 50 GH/s. That would mean that 1,800 would be required to replicate the hashing power already in existence. Total retail cost $4,498,200.
On the one hand, the Bitforce isn't a shipping product. But on the other, someone buying that many machines isn't necessarily going the retail route - they'll do what Avalon did and contract it out to a foundry themselves. 
So, really, $4.5 million is likely at the high end of the range of what it would cost to take over the network today. Though, as more capacity is brought online, that number will change.

I'd say that so long as there's more than one exchange, we're good. Exchanges are there just as a venue for exchange between two willing participants, if people don't want to transact at the price one exchange is offering, they don't have to.
The threat of a "51%" attack on exchanges is nonsensical - the only way to corrupt the exchange system is by having 100% control over them.
What is a far bigger threat in my eyes is that of ASIC miners an the potential that one large player decides to not play nice anymore. They could take over 51% of the hashing power of the network in not too long a period, and arbitrarily request transaction fees far in excess of the "default".
Instead of being alarmed, though, everyone seems to be cheerleading this eventuality... But yeah, that's a far bigger threat than having a dominant exchange could ever be.

you realize that the big picture will never get here if everyone sits on their coins, right? For bitcoin to succeed in reaching that big picture, it needs to be a currency that's circulating, not one that's padding each persons wallet.
Odd as it may sound, the best way for bitcoin to reach where we want it to get to is by all of us speing most your coins rather than sitting on them

ASICminer is making far more money from their own mining operations than they are from selling chips, guaranteed. I'd almost think that the only reason they're selling chips is to make certain that the hashing power of the rest of the network keeps up just enough to insure that they don't surpass 49% of the hashing power one day.

I don't know, but I'm going to wager that if you ask the 99% of the world who doesn't frequent these forums, they're going to be a whole lot more befuddled trying to transact with Bitcoin than they would be with Paypal.

Wrong. Simply put, deflation is a negative for industry.  If today, a company could invest $1000 in order to purchase 1,000 widgets for their employees to use, but they knew that if they waited a week that $1000 could be used to purchase 1,100 widgets, they won't make the investment today, they'll wait a week. And a week later they know that if they wait another week, they'll be able to purchase 1200 widgets, again, they'll wait another week. And when it comes time to make that decision a week later... well, you hopefully get the idea.
Deflation is the enemy of investment, and, when it spreads throughout the economy, the enemy of the entire economy. Why should I buy X today when I know just by waiting, I'll be able to buy more X's for that same amount of money?
In contrast, inflation incentives purchases and investment - the imaginary company whose pondering purchasing 1,000 widgets for their employees for $1,000 will be much more likely to make that purchase if they know that next week that $1,000 will only buy 900 widgets and the week following, it will only buy 800 widgets. 
Deflation keeps money, and therefore resources, idle. Inflation puts money and resources to work.

the "underbanked" have this pesky problem of not having computers, which makes transacting in Bitcoin a real pain. 
And underbanked people who are starting a business will find that lacking computers, lacking suppliers that accept bitcoin and lacking bank accounts to convert bitcoins to the currency their vendors use makes Bitcoin denominated microloans not the most useful of devices.

ASICs arent an off the shelf component. Otherwise, Butterfly Labs wouldn't be having any problems at all - they would just buy their ASIC's from the same source that ASCIMiner uses. It doesnt' work like that. An attacker would design their own ASIC and contract it out to a foundry.

You lose your physical wallet - go online, get a new drivers license. Call bank, have new debit/credot card shipped out to you AND get coverage against any fraudulent transactions that might have occured while the thief had your wallet. Well, you're on the hook for $50 or $500 of it. Lose cash, yes.
Lose Bitcoin wallet: lose entire life savings, or at least all of the bitcoins that were inn that wellet. 
I'd rather the first, personally.

People love to throw that out, and it worked in during the gold rush because gold was a finite resource. But in the real world, current ASIC producers don't seem to be going along with the theory, at all.

Just to think conspiratorialy - do you think that the costs to overrun the Bitcoin network would be infeasible to the US Government? I tend to think that, if they decided to go after it, they could accomplish a 51% attack (or far greater than that) with ease, while the cost would be just a rounding error inside one of their departments budgets. Obviously, going after BTC with CPU's or GPU's would be prohibitive, but rolling out their own ASIC to make the attack would pose no problem if they were so inclined. Which I doubt they are, for the record.

So, Bitcoin has become the Freidcat Trading Network, has it?
Litecoin doesn't sound so bad anymore. One of the great selling points of BTC has been that we are all involved, that its a peer to peer network.
Increasingly, it looks like its about to turn into a one player game.

then explain Japan, who's been battling deflation for a couple of decades now?
Computers are definetly a deflating item, and taken to the extreme, no one should ever purchase one, because right after they purchase, they'll find that they could have bought more computer for less money. But most other products aren't that way. Cars only go up in price. Houses, prior to the big crash, tended to go upwards. People would borrow money now in order to make those purchases because they believed if they didn't, then those purchases would be even more expensive later on. But we just saw a deflationary collapse in housing - as prices plummeted, no buyers could be found because they were all waiting for prices to get cheaper and cheaper. Now that that finally stopped and reversed, (home prices were just reported as going up for the the third month in a row in 20 different markets) people are starting to consider wading back into the market - they know/believe that if they wait longer then prices will be higher still.
Computers are an abberation compared to everything else we purchase.

Just tell them to accept Bitpay and treat Bitcoin like any other non-cash donation they might receive (ie stocks, bonds, cars, etc) - liquidate what they receive immediately in order to turn into cash. 501c3's have reporting issues and the risk of misreporting something (say, the value of 500 bitcoins) could result in tax penalties or loss of their tax-exempt status altogether. Lot of risk there. But if they just accept bitcoin under the auspice that they're going to convert to dollars (and then to the national currency that their beneficiaries utilize), they're still sidestepping credit card fees AND might stand to receive additional donations from the Bitcoin community that they wouldn't have received without engendering that bit of good will from us.

Just thinking aloud here. Not advocating for the end of Bitcoin by any stretch - Bitcoin is not going anywhere, nor should it. It's got the lions share of support, and is amassing serious wealth in its ecosystem.
But I think an objective observer would say that there are definite issues cropping up now that it's coming of age that might make it more suited to being a reserve currency, used mainly in facilitating transfer between numerous local cryptocurrencies or use-specific currencies (i.e. Namecoin for DNS, someone posted either here or at bitcointalk the possibility of using a bitcoin-type system for proving ownership of securities, so that could be another "Coin", etc). 
The mining cartels being one issue, the simple amount of time for a transaction to be confirmed being another glaring issue. It's going to be hard to convince retailers that Bitcoin's irreversible transactions are superior to chargeback-able credit card transactions when the buyer could be miles away before the seller gets the first hint that the transaction is being rejected by the network.
