Of course not, but we're already in too deep with Wall Street &amp; cash-settled futures. It's unfortunate it happened in the first place.

Wait, what? You can rattle off several but you want me to? Go ahead and just rrrrraattle em off bud!

"Wall St doesn't follow rules" and "not your keys" were your counter-points, no? Go ahead then, let's hear em.

Hey, like I always say, when your counter-points get rekt just start name-calling.
Bitcoin futures exist. Both on Wall Street and in crypto via bitmex.
Futures are being used to suppress price, just like they were with gold in early 2000s. 
The introduction of gold-backed ETFs ended the short-it-to-the-ground price suppression and led to true price discovery.
You can be against Bitcoin ETFs, but if you hold BTC and hope it appreciates it doesn't make sense to be.

Oy vey.

Pfffft. Weak af.

Yeah the hidden leverage thing is TDB. Loeffler not mentioning it doesn't necessarily mean they'll allow it though, we'll see.

True, but the Cboe/SolidX physically-backed BTC ETF provides secure custody and the fund's assets are insured by a syndicate of A-rated insurers. I expect Bakkt will have something similar.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:26:56
Right - That's why I like the Bakkt physical futures from what we've heard so far. No leverage, no margin, actual BTC delivery at expiry. No paper claims on real assets.

Like the tweet says - talking about gold in the early 2000s before gold ETFs were introduced, it's well document how futures affected price at that time.
Some futures are settled in cash, yes, bitmex is settled in bitcoin as will be Bakkt
All that was in the tweet
