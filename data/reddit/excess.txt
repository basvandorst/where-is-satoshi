Thanks for the concise explanation; I never understood until now how bitcoincrash could possibly affect the decentralization of the network.

Did he said that via a private message on out in the public? If it was posted publicly maybe google your old reddit username+bitcoin or +wallet?

Yet here we have someone making a sincere effort to learn about the topic and you shun him away with your pedantic views of how things should be done.
Asking more versed people about a topic IS making an effort to research it.
You are not helping to dissipate the FUD, you are making it worse.

Whenever someone cry censorship it's usually because the people downvoted them to oblivion, not because they are persecuted and have their posts removed.

Noob question: Lets say I send some BTC to a [blockchain.info]( wallet and backup the 24 words seed. Who *has* the keys in that situation?

What's a *burn address*?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:32:36
But then what difference would it make to send them to a burn address as opposed to simply hodling them in your own and "forgetting" the key?

Thanks, I'll look into them.

Actually, bulls (all cows really) are green-red colorblind. It's not the color of the flag that sets them off, it's... THE MOVEMENT!
PS: I'm available for hire to animate parties by the way, I'm told that I'm fun at them.

Whats the other %90?
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:44:17
It is.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:03:12
How? Utilities? Taxes? Food?

Damn, at least [let the body cool off before harvesting it for organs](

You used that password in a random website that didn't secure it properly and got stolen. You can check in 
[ which website leaked your password for the world to see. Change the password, ignore the email. 
Those emails are autogenerated and pray on your fear and ignorance, they where mass produced by an algorithm and sent to thousands of different individuals at once. They couldn't care less about YOU in particular and nobody installed a virus on your machine. They hope someone among those thousands will pay out of fear, and they bank on that.
Ignore it, change your password, keep on pleasuring yourself in front of your webcam for the russian h4ke3rs to see like always.
