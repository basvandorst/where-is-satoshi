Correct me if i’m wrong but iirc the numbers are more like 90% win, 8% osx, 2% linux for end users, 85% windows, 15% linux for servers.
Android is clearly a corporate version of linux which only got so big because a huge company threw all their money and marketing behind a streamlined simplified version. Which was exactly my point.
Anyways the point of this clearly was not to discuss unix market shares so i’m out.

Yeah that was my point.
The centralized corporation version of unix (=osx)  became a huge success whereas more idealistic unix builds remained a niche nerd thing
Obv i meant osx not ios. But yall get the point.

Man you’re easily the biggest tool in this thread.

I hear you.
Or we might use Apples or Chases blockchain instead of btc.
Which i hope won’t but fear will happen.

Well lets hope you guys put up a better fight than lets say unix vs ios. Cause usually the corporations win against a handful of idealistic nerds.

The fact aside that bcash is totally irrelevant, it still is a more corporate/less idealistic version of core.

Aside from that comparison you’re saying that it’s not the case that historically a lot of times the corporate washed up commercial version of an idealistic product became way more successful than the “original”?
And aside from the main argument i obviously was making you are also trying to ignore the fact that nowadays most unix distributions are open source, idealistically and maybe theoretically better than osx but osx has 1000x the market share?
Not sure what point you are trying to make really.

Come on these are obviously bots can some mod look into this?
