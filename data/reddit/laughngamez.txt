It was a pack on my minecraft server as lame as it sounds.
Edit: Thanks for the support guys, glad to see the community cares about adoption! The service I used to add payments to mc servers is "Buycraft" they utilize coinbase to process the payments.
Edit  Server IP is mcp-mcs.com if anyone was wondering.

I've been in -10k before. Gotta love selling virtual goods.

What about black arrow?
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:21:58
Shucks, maybe I will consider buying in instead, thanks anyway!

Thanks, glad to see the community is happy about acceptance :D

I've got about 10 LTC from mining, and thinking about trading half for BTC what do you think?
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:49:41
That sounds like a bad experience, this whole this is sketchy but I am younger so money does not mean as much to me. I will listen to your warning and likely stick with alt mining or plain out buying though. Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:17:47
Thanks for all the suggestions, I'm sure one of them will work!

A secure exchange which accepts PayPal deposits would be huge! 
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:28:34
So I guess mining altcoins might be the best bet then.

I didn't think that bitcoin difficulty was rising that fast, even if the price does not rise.

We mainly focus on running a prison themed server connect to mcp-mcs.com 
We are however working on a hub server with original gamemodes connect to mc.cdgs.net

It's all good, just glad I asked before making any decisions. Luckily with paypal disputes are a thing, but it's one of the reasons I want BTC to take off. I've lost my fair share of money to abusers of paypal's system.

So a miner like this:  
At current rates/difficulty will pay itself off in 40 days, even if the difficulty doubles in that time why would it not make a profit?

What was so bad about Butterfly Labs?

LTC seems to trade with BTC at about .025 it generally follows BTC due to it not being as widely accepted as BTC. I think I will trade some LTC to BTC just to diversify, even though they trade at the same ratio almost all the time.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:11:59
Links please, considering that bitcoin price has been higher mining now could be very profitable if I hold.
Edit: Preferably for sale over Paypal.

Not at the current rates, I've mined over 10 LTC on 1 GPU at this point.

Not sure about the fees compared to other methods but  is legit.

Used to be 45 for just PayPal, now it's 180. I also believe CC payments can be charged back further.

Cat + Bitcoin = Karma

Thanks for the spoiler.
