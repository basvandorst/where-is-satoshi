Also I think about the person that took out $329k on their house and put it into Bitcoin   They said they'd sell at $10k.

They charge $300 a month to filter the bad reviews out and keep the good reviews on top
So if my company is being horrible to customers for the last 3 months, the average person wouldnt know if I paid yelp to filter those out or put them at the bottom of their "yelp sort". Same with BBB. They're not government, they're a corrupt business that has a strong following, and you can pay them like $300 a month for them to give you an a+ rating. 
Yelp could go bankrupt for all I care. I'd donate a million if I could to help take down both of those companies.

THATS WHY YOU NEVER PAY IN BITCOIN. THE VALUE GOES UP IN BITCOIN ALL THE TIME, ITS STUPID TO SELL FOR A CANDY BAR OR A $200 COMPUTER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY AFFORD.

We are back in 1700 though! hopefully to stay, because I bought more at 1701...
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:04:14
Exactly, if you use coinbase and use your debit/credit, youll need Bitcoin to go up 8+% before you even make a profit!

Imagine the person that put in $330k when it was 1701 and had the chance to sell at over 1800. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:36:15
I put in $80 last thursday and its barely at $84 (after fees.) Scared to buy a full bitcoin, but I feel like since more are buying, they price will go up 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:14:22
At the price now, $1739, if you pull out now you'll be up $7110. That's not bad. If it goes up like it have been lately, about $250 a week, you'll make $50k in a week. Not bad at all. 
I wish you luck, I'm over here going crazy over making a couple hundred off Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:55:37
Seems like a reasonable idea for a made up currency.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:01:07
But, if it drops and you decide not to hodl, say to $1000, you'll have to wait until that 4-5 days is over before you can withdraw, which may be too late. But if it goes up to $3000, you'd be happy that took a long time to transfer 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:30:20
This issue is sure, buy a bit coin and sell in 5 years or so. What happens when they run out, we can all guess, but no one knows if it'll crash or shoot up to an outrageous price, making many millionaires. Now let's say the trend stays the same for 5 years from now, then it should be at roughly 8,200-9,000 USD per BTC. Yeah, 6,500 to 7,300 for doing nothing would be dope, but why stop there? It's the same as betting. Think blackjack. You get a crazy hand and win and then you decide ok, I'm bound to lose and you put in the minimum bet and then boom, blackjack. Or the reverse can happen, you bid too much and then coincidence, dealer gets blackjack and you're fucked. 
Same can happen with Bitcoin. Do I risk less, or listen to the trends and put all my money in that I can. We have all heard stories of people buying BTC looooowwwww [like 100-300] and selling at $1k+ (or at least the same with stocks). It's stressful and the first thing you do when you put that much money in is check these prices 85 times a day. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:17:42
They should really post the picture flat, because that's pretty much what happens once it breaks $1x00, $2x00, etc. Also interesting that a worldwide currency reddit goes off USD price to show advancement.
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:22:48
You can, but you will see a small increase. For example, if you bought last week when it was $1496, and sold now at 1743 a BTC, you'd profited $82.55. Not bad, but $247 seems better with the same exact risk, just more money on the table.
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:16:14
My point exactly 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:51:24
Well the way BTC and ETH is going, you'll be making less and less as time goes on. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:00:41
I have quickly learned that this is the answer 
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:36:05
Same, but $25 lol
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:54:36
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:58:24
Exactly. Or would still be hodling forever pretty much
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:26:55
I know, but I am just saying, dealing with bitcoin and cash is a shady situation. If you're in the wrong and the store pockets the money, who will you call other than your "boys" to commit a (possible) even bigger crime. Just saying, I recommend making sure everything is legit, at least for buying the BTC. We have all broke the law a few times at least, so I am not saying don't break the law or be shady, just be careful and think before you make these decisions. Or dont, doesnt matter. I have been lagging on buying bitcoin since $1050, and then $1200, then $1500, finally buying at $1600. I need sleep lol sorry for the mini rant
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:09:48
1704, looks like we might break the 1700 barrier again

Used to sell LibertyX at our store. The funny thing is people were most likely buying for illegal reasons. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:27:42
You are correct that was unexpected.

@_date: 2017-05-27 06:10:29
I am sorry. Buy more now though!
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:45:05
So no ones used it?
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:08:02
Eh, I wouldnt recommend it. The only benefits they give you are 1000 Satoshi an hour and they put you in a Bitcoin lottery, which you can win 1 Bitcoin in a year. You do have to work weekends though. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:19:58
We can go off pesos, ruppees, any Asian currency, Canadian, pretty much any other currency. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:55:17
Or show them the price. And keep doing it once a week or once a month. They will eventually invest. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:21:00
$1200 per Bitcoin profit would make it worth it to get a dual citizenship.

John Legere would probably be up for it, does he have a reddit?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:44:57
They guy who did is still up $300+ per BTC he bought 
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:46:22
Don't live near there at all, but regulating a currency that isn't owned by your country is a joke, unless we are talking $10k+ USD worth, then they'd assume it's for illegal reasons.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:51:38
So you explain what you should do smart ass
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:39:51
Yes. A room in Antioch/Pittsburg is roughly $700-$900, while Berkeley is $1000-$1300. I live out in Berkeley and am paying $950 a month for a room. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:07:12
Honest is buy a full Bitcoin, sell it exactly a week later, make generally $180-$250+ a week. That's an easy $500+ a month. A lot of stress if you look at it all day every day though. Especially days like today. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:56:18
This is what happens when people go "oh my god it hit $2800, it's gonna blow! I'll sell!" They sell and then the 3rd parties have more money, price goes down. So stop selling unless you're moving big money. Oh you made $20 in a week, stop messing with people with 2k+ invested. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:58:53

Living an hour away for a major city and paying $100-$200 in Uber fees just to get there is not fun. Rather pay a couple hundred more a month to live closer to where I want to go to all the time. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 03:22:11
That's how I lost my first 4 houses, I should try doing the opposite from now on. I'll wait til BTC is $3000 before I buy
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:17:34
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:05:46
That's strange. Shit I'll sell there. USD?
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:11:03
But then the company Purse wouldn't love you like they do now. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:03:01
A quick search says avg people will pay 10-15% of the earnes amount. So say tax is 15%. You put it $1,000 and it grew to $1,300. You'd pay tax on $300, which would be something like $45. 
So say you used coinbase. They would take $15 on the $1000 down(so $1015). Then selling at $1300, theyd take $20(over estimate). So $300-$45-$20-$15 is $220. Still a decent profit, but that's almost 27% given to taxes and fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:00:36
Yeah, even owning $110k in bitcoin is not bad at all. Also, $110k in less than a month is fucking crazy.

Estimation for when BTC hits $500k
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:50:40
What's funny is I saw it drop $20, so at like $1720 I went to sell and there was an error and then something came up IRL. When I checked BTC later on it was at $1820, and I was glad there was an error haha
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:31:31
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:53:10
That's what I think. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:15:24
The 3-8% they take from buying and selling should go towards better servers or upgrading servers 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:30:27
Maybe $2900, for sure $3000. Because the short hodlers will want to sell. 
Edit: ok I just saw it went over $2900, it might be crashing now. 
Even more edit: it was just a temporary crash. Maybe $2800 is our life now
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:11:41
I know, I bought at $2600 the other day and now I'm happy haha only took a couple days

You can buy using libertyx. Used to sell it in my store and would take cash. Not sure if that's still the case because we don't sell it anymore. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:16:06
Maybe when BTC decides to go up again
