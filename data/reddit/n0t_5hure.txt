I agree with you to some extent, as the market is significantly broader.  There may be people in Venezuela pouring into bitcoin because of inflation while speculators exit in the United States, but it is virtually impossible to quantify how big of an impact that would be.  I'll add that in my opinion the big 2017 run up in price was due largely to speculation, as it has been in past booms.  If you look at the steep 2017 run up in price and compare to past bull markets it looks much the same.  If you take a look at a chart showing the bear market from the peak of $1072 on 11/29/13 to the bottom of $198 on 1/14/15, that is an 81.5% drop and still fairly recent.  A similar drop today would put bitcoin at around $4K.  I like to use [this chart]( when looking at price history because it allows you to focus on price movements for specific time windows and contains annotations of significant events.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:29:45
I agree.  Looking at past bitcoin bear markets, the selloff has been 60-90%+ off the peak over a period of 6-18 months.  Using ~$20K as the peak price, we're looking at a price range of $2-8K.  Given that the recent bull market was extraordinary, my guess is that we're looking at an extraordinary selloff.  After seeing signs of a market top, I started selling on December 26th, and am out for now.  The market is behaving just as I would expect, with weaker and weaker rallies, none of which even remotely threaten to bring it back to its all-time high.  
As far as when to buy back in, I don't think in terms of price, but rather conditions and timing.  Markets don't turn on a dime and its going to take time for the bear market to work itself out.  The sell off hasn't really begun in earnest yet.  We'll see where we stand in a few months.  In general, when I start seeing Jamie Dimon and others saying "I told you so," the bitcoin market more or less demoralized, and price starting to creep up with no positive news, I'll buy back in.  That will likely be more than a year from now.  
Edit:  RemindMe! 2 months
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:27:57
I was expecting it, and you should have been too.  Bitcoin is in a bear market, and has been since it sold off from the peak of $19,800.  I further expect the selling to continue, with the bears dominating for about a year, as has happened in past bear markets.  Sub-$4K bitcoin seems likely.

It has the same engine/transmission as in the Toyota Corolla S, the Celica GTS, and Matrix TRS. Lotus did their own intake, exhaust, and ECU, so it pumps out 190hp, about 15 more than the ones put into Toyota cars. It doesn't sound like much, but the car weigh only 1950lb, so they have decent performance. 0-60 is about 4.7 seconds, but the real advantage is the handling. There is nothing like it on the road anywhere near this price point. Think of it as a baby F40 - a street legal track car. They're a riot to drive.

Fool? I cashed out in December when I saw that the conditions that led to the 100x run had changed. I am now sitting out, patiently waiting for the current conditions to change, teeing up the next run. Talk to me at the end of September, and throw it in my face if I am wrong.
As far as a "crystal ball" goes, no magic is necessary.  Just Google "speculative bubble chart". We're in the "capitulation" section of the "blow off" phase. We still have to pass through "despair" before it's time to buy again. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 17:26:17
The timing is difficult to hit with any accuracy because it depends upon so many factors. That said, the general pressure is down, and will likely continue to be that way until we pass through complete demoralization. I don't see that happening until at least December, but it will more likely take longer than that. The last bear market was 15 months, and I think this one will be at least as long, if not longer. I think a key factor will be the resolution of the tether situation. There is an open criminal investigation into price manipulation, and until that investigation bears fruit or is laid to rest, it will cast a shadow over the market. I personally think that there is substantial evidence to support the view that unbacked tether issuance has been used and is still being used to pump up bitcoin. The eventual unwinding of tether will probably be the moving force that pushes the market into complete demoralization, clearing the decks for the next run. What will the bottom be? I'd say probably $1-2K, but possibly a little lower.  I agree that $1200 is probably a good estimate, but bitcoin has breached prior peaks before, so that isn't a hard floor. I have a hard time seeing bitcoin fall below $800 though. When will we see it? Probably spring of 2019, but possibly as early as December 2018.  It all depends on how the investigation plays out. It may not be until the summer of 2019.  When will we see $20K again? Not for a while. After we see bottom, a small bounce back, and then stabilization, it'll take a year or so for the price to double from where it stabilizes. Then another year or so before we hit around $16K, or about 80% of the last peak. From there, it will take off and run to probably $80-100K as the masses pile in. So I'd say $20K is probably 2.5 years off. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:34:58
You say this as if it's all random. It's not.  The conditions that brought it from $19,500 to $6,500 are still prevalent and unlikely to change for a while.

The SEC panel rejects a bitcoin ETF, issues a lengthy statement about why it rejected the ETF, discussing manipulation and nothing to mitigate the concern, which was endorsed by the chairman and 2 of the 3 commissioners, and all I see on reddit is "SEC COMMISSIONER WANTS BITCOIN ETF!!!!!!!!!"  
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:00:30
SEC is concerned about manipulation, not surprising in light of the same issue with the last ETF it considered and the open criminal investigation into price manipulation.  The SEC will likely approve an ETF eventually, but not until the Tether bomb drops.
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:55:26
Well, it was around $11-12K at that point and it's half that now. The unwinding of tether should easily cut it in half from here. It's drifting south anyway, even with the tether pumps. There are limits to what can be done, even if you have unlimited free USDT tokens. We've bounced into the $5Ks twice now, and it's making lower highs and lower lows. I think testing $5K is definitely on the table by the end of September.

I don't think I know the future.  I do think I have the capacity to understand what is happening and make reasonable inferences about where it will lead, as I have been doing in this context since I became involved with bitcoin in March of 2016, when it was $450.  So far, my inferences have been on point.  However, I always look for objective information that will tell me I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:23:30
The SEC probably knows where the CFTC and Justice Department are heading with their criminal investigation into price manipulation.  They further know that approving a ETF will be bullish, and cause the public to pour into bitcoin.  Moreover, an ETF will allow exposure to bitcoin by institutional investors, including pension funds.  If the SEC were to approve an ETF, and then the Justice Department drops indictments for price manipulation, not only would the price of bitcoin plummet and take people's retirement money with it, it would also make the SEC look like idiots for approving the ETF while there is an open criminal investigation into price manipulation.  If you read between the lines in the recent SEC statement on the Winklevoss ETF, it sounds like they won't approve an ETF until they are confident that there are reasonable checks on price manipulation.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology, but will also likely be the biggest financial bubble of all time.

When that bubble pops and bitcoin price plummets to a fraction of the bubble peak, and Jamie Dimon et al. are saying "I told you so", it will be time to think about getting back in.

I don't think so.  It could go to $.01 and it would still function as a censor-resistant money transfer network, which is where a large portion of its fundamental value lies.  The only thing that will kill it is a core failure, such as the hacking of SHA-256.  I think $1K-$2K, or 90%+ off peak, is a realistic, objective estimate of where things are headed once the Tether situation fully unwinds, possibly even lower, though I think that is unlikely.  In any event, all I can do is sit tight and wait until the situation is done unwinding, and then it will be time to load up and wait.

Wait until it starts making higher highs consistently over at least a 3 month period. It hasn't stopped making lower lows yet. My guess is that it'll be 6 months to a year before the the time is right to buy.

Thanks.  I didn't understand this.

I'm not sure I follow you on this.  Are you saying that the investigation is a dog and pony show to say "look guys, we took a close look at this and no manipulation, so we're just going to approve this ETF"?  If so, to convince me of this there has to be some evidence to support this conclusion.  A more reasonable explanation is that the people who lost their asses in the last 6 months or so have raised holy hell with the CFTC and SEC, who are looking into it but move at a snail's pace.  There is plenty of evidence in the public record to show that price manipulation is highly likely, and to be in the market while the issue is being sorted is a dangerous game.

Sounds reasonable, and I think this is a necessary prerequisite to reset for the next 30-100X run.  The thing is, the mere act of accomplishing this will be brutal for the crypto markets when it actually happens.

You make a whole lot of sense, but unfortunately there are a lot of people that don't want to hear what you're saying.  My guess is that the buying opportunity won't come until December at the earliest, but probably more like March of 2019.  There are still a lot of issues that have to be worked through.

And what exactly does that mean, that the letter is "legitimate"?  [That some unknown person asserts that there was a certain amount of money in a bank account at a certain time, and felt confident enough to attest to it "without any liability, however arising, on the part of Deltec Bank and Trust Limited, its officers, directors, employees and shareholders. . ."](  Wow, they're really sticking their neck out there!!!!

Given that there is still an open criminal investigation into price manipulation, there is further to fall. 
For those downvoting me, I'm giving the OP exactly what he asked for.  Moreover, there is an [open criminal price manipulation investigation.](  If you don't see how this could possibly affect the price of bitcoin, ask yourself what you think would happen if the DOJ dropped indictments for price manipulation.  Then ask yourself, what if one of the top 5 exchanges by volume [has admitted in public that wash trading]( an illegal manipulative practice, has occurred on its exchange?

Sort of.  The redistribution plan has to be filed by February 14, 2019.  The actual redistribution will come some time thereafter.

You and I have different goals and strategies. I'm not a trader, I'm a speculator. My focus is on the long-term trend, not the interim price movement. I agree with you that there is a movement underway, but I don't see it as a long-term trend reversal, but rather an interim movement in a drawn-out bear market. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that this bump could peak out in the mid-$8K range before coming back down, and that we'll back in the $5Ks in less than 3 months.

Here's how I see it: this down cycle is similar to the last one, in that it's going to take a while to work through. As it stands, there is an open criminal investigation into price manipulation, which carries the potential of wreaking serious havoc on the crypto markets. If you look at it objectively, there is definitely manipulation. Indeed, Bitfinex's website has posts about manipulation that has occurred, and Potter was on whalepool talking about spoofing and wash trading, trying to explain it away. Accordingly, I think it's more likely than not that at some point the CFTC and/or the SEC will drop indictments, and the markets will respond appropriately. Add in the fact that a huge number of people poured into the market in the latter half of 2017 and either closed out at a loss or are sitting on huge losses, it doesn't leave a lot of people out there to pour into the market and run the price up right now.
That said, once all the shit is worked through, there will be another big run. If I had to estimate, I'd say that it will peak out somewhere around $100K, and that will probably be around the end of 2020, with the safest entry point likely coming in the spring of 2019. However, take these estimates with a grain of salt, lots can happen between now and then.

There is a crypto bear market in progress. Don't buy until it is over.

Can someone explain why 94% success rate in routing payments is good?  I suppose it is better than a lower success rate, but a 6% failure rate seems bad when sending money around.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:33:24
No one knows for sure until the trend reverses, but in my opinion late summer at the earliest, but more likely not until 2019.  Until the tether situation works itself out, I don't see the bear market being over.  If I had to give a price estimate of bitcoin at the bottom, I'd say very likely sub-$2k, and possibly sub-$1K.  That said, there is absolutely no way to forecast these things with pinpoint accuracy, and I'm just going from past bear markets, with the most analogous one being the 11/29/13 to 4/26/15 bear market that shaved &gt;80% off the market peak.  I think the current bear market, coming off the biggest bull market run, will be worse.  Just one man's opinion though.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:54:47
Well, you're already underwater, enjoying the life of a bear market hodler.  If it will bother you to see the price cut in half before the next bull market, you might want to sell now.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:49:43
By my estimation, there is at least 6 months and 50% lower left in this bear market. However, I've consistently underestimated how long it would take to get under $5K, so I could be underestimating how long the bear market will last.

The chart posted by OP indicates that the current price is the bottom, and then wonders about the next bull run. Instead of a price for the bottom, it should have "???".

Does anyone know how this type of chart is made?  What tool is being used?
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:25:04
Actually, I'm currently a nocoiner, having sold out back in December 2017.  I've been patiently waiting for the market to bottom and turn around.  While we've made good progress as of late, I think we have at least another 3 months to go, probably more like 6 months, but maybe even as long as another year.  A key factor will be the resolution of the pending [DOJ price manipulation investigation (aka., the Tether situation).](  Until that risk is mitigated, I'm going to sit tight.
