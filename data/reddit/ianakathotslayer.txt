I have solar panels
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:02:10
yea I tried nice hash and it estimated id get 35 cents per day so I switched to honey miner which gets me 50 cents per day and I find the UI to be more user friendly, also my gpu is a nvidia 1060 GeForce, so not the best but do you think 50 cents seems like the right amount to be earning with that gpu?
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:17:20
Bit coin mining,  is that like a better app?
@_date: 2018-08-25 05:25:11

Ok man im not asking how I can make money ( I know of lots of ways I can make more money then bitcoin mining btw). Anyways where I live there are no recycle depots where they give you money in return. So if you have nothing that relates to the subject I suggest you continue to deep throat your own dick. Good day :).
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:28:49

     Well I use paxful and you know they give you a wallet. I buy the bitcoin from the people with a giftcard and it gets sent to the paxful bitcoin walletthey give you.Then send that to my wallet on the DNM.
    Paxful is like coinbase basically. Is that what the exchange is? Sorry but I really don't know shit about bitcoin and stuff like that.

Well crypto is still in its infancy, once its more widely adapted it wont be so prone to fluctuate in price , and eventually fiat will die out and bitcoins value will become very stagnant. I believe a catalyst for this will be US dollar hyper inflation.This is what I think anyways
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:26:39
