It should pop back to around 500 in the next 2 days, it may be brief just keep an I eye on it. That's my guess.

Still wouldn't describe him as refreshing. I really can't stand the idea of people listening and following these talking heads.

There is no separation. Only a oneness. Reality is experience, consciousness. I am you, you are me, there is only now.

When I think terrorism, I think killing / maiming / blowing up civilians. Now, who is doing the most of that right now? USA Drone Strikes. Gotta face up to the reality that it's USA that is killing the civilians and the funding is not anonymous. It's all out in the open, that's how mass crimes can happen. You just label a group of people as subhuman, call them terrorists.

Yeah, there was a pump in China tonight, up to about 520. I think it the lowest it will hit is 480 or so. I think anywhere around 500 is good before this next bubble.
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:33:04
If I had to guess, I would say the price will be around 600 -750 until this thing is over. Then the price will rise to over 1000 from all the publicity. I think the coins will go for above market price. If I were a large investor and wanted these coins I would bid slightly above market price. News of someone purchasing them above market price will take the price up anyway. But what do I know? This is bitcoin, who knows. Not me.
Edited for a typo.

If you think bitcoin is going to continue gaining popularity then buy now. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:49:29
I am wondering how the intelligence realm will respond to Bitcoin. How will the CIA react? Will they use Bitcoin to increase their own power or will they bring it down because it threatens the system that feeds the MIC.

We could be at bottom now, or it could be 420, 360, 260. 260 is the lowest it will bottom. A lot of coins will be stripped from weak hands if we go that low.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:08:30
Kind of an ironic comment since you just speculated that it never will reach mass adoption.
@_date: 2014-05-17 11:55:11
Yeah, basically since we entered May. I think it is good. Most of the anxious investors who put in too much money have bailed I think. Eventually all the coins at these prices will be bought up and we will start trending upwards again. I anticipate another bubble.
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:14:58
You're right but they are so cute.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:36:49
If you love someone, encourage them to eat right, exercise and wear a seat belt. You are more likely to be killed by a US police officer than a terrorist. Terrorism is statistically insignificant. Dog bites are more dangerous, slipping and falling is more dangerous. Don't get hung up on the sensationalism of it. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:30:35
The technology is still sound, news is good, price has been less volatile lately but has not bubbled up yet. I would say, yes if you want to take a risk, invest, I think it will bubble up in the next 3 months. BTC has not yet reached it's potential as a global crypto, there is no guarantee that it ever will but if it does, the value of BTC will be through the roof. There will be more bubbles as adoption and usage increases. The exchange rate bubble cycle is the way BTC behaves as it expands in our culture. Crypto will be the currency of the future, so long as we don't have some kind of apocalypse that wipes out computers....and in that case, money doesn't matter anyway. The question is, will BTC be the first global crypto? I think, yes. Because people want it to be and they are working to make it happen. People who do stuff, they create the future.

Are you trying to trade the market at the top or just hodling? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:49:15
Making claims about an unknown future is speculating. Claiming that your speculations are fact is not convincing.
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:09:27
I agree with your outlook. 2 Months is probably the soonest I can see a strong up trend. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:27:31
Can you elaborate on that theory?
@_date: 2014-06-22 21:40:32
Step 1) Make crazy promises
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:06:40
I think we will hover around here until July or August at least.

In general, everyone is super polite at @_date: 2014-05-22 09:01:09
TA is one side of trading, I think it helps you perceive the present and past market but it does not predict the future. Half of trading is emotion and intuition.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:51:38
The conversion rate to dollars changes constantly but that is not anything changing with btc. That is only change in perception resulting in a change in exchange rate. No one is manipulating btc, if you understand the protocol correctly. Absolutely, the market and exchange rate can be manipulated. That is human nature, something we can't change. The plus side for me is there is not a group of people who can print money and give it to themselves.
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:12:46
Sounds about right. I was thinking July at soonest but that is probably wishful thinking. September seems realistic. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:47:47
HAHA Nice!
@_date: 2014-09-09 00:29:13
Is English not your first language? You seem to not understand. I did not say bitcoin was a company. I did not say bitcoin was private. I said the public (as in the general populace) is not going to jump on bitcoin any time soon (as in the masses are not going to start using it right now, because they have no reason to). You should focus on reading and understanding before commenting.
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:04:31
That is true, human nature will infect any new system given enough time.
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:44:04
That doesn't really answer it for me. Still wondering. We will just have to wait and see IMO.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:27:56
That is true but there are some pretty standard ways to set things up. Payment services is not usually the type of graphic design that would be very creatively set up. It's usually set up like everything else. Even the color scheme is usually blue for finance and banking imagery because blue is trustworthy color.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:51:02
As far as I can tell, "The Global War On Terror" is creating more extremism and is a mask for western aggression. As for counter-terrorism within the US, I doubt they will ever uncover any large plots before they happen. They will probably mostly be used to harass political groups like OWS. I understand the need for a government like ours to have a counter-terror operation but the budget is way overblown. And let's face it, you can't stop somebody from doing something bad, they will just think up new more creative ways to do it.  
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:30:54
I think you may have responded to the wrong comment.
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:32:06
I'm not seeing that.

Ever since that matrix movie came out, the word real has lost all meaning anyway.

You are selling where smart smart money is buying. You are gettin shaken out. Nothing has changed, bitcoin is doing well and has a use. It will not be adopted by mainstream over night but over the next 15 years or so. It could fail but what is happening now is just a correction of the market. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:33:52
Anything is possible. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:35:01
It is risky but the risk to reward is high. We are near the bottom, so anything below 470 is a good long position, unless you believe bitcoin is going to go to zero, which I don't because it seems to be progressing all the time. The downward trend since January is a normal correction.
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:42:43
Stop being so dramatic.
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:41:47
The public is not going to jump on bitcoin any time soon but it will happen gradually. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:11:15
The strong down trend is coming to a close but it's not going up yet. It's going to hover in this area for a few months until there is a reason for it to go up. Actually, if it hovered for a few months around 400-500, that would be a reason to go up because it is behaving as a more stable store of wealth. Know what I'm sayin?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:58:19
Now is not a good time to sell. We may go lower, to 250 but it will be brief. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:45:20
This is also true. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:38:24
I think you mean helping the CIA move money to the terrorists.
@_date: 2014-05-11 06:48:25
Well, I think it's obvious. If bitcoin eventually rivals the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency, we have a situation where the control over printing money is lost. US dollar can't compete, now US can't fund expensive wars and covert operations that the people do not support. 
I am not arguing this is the case, just something I wonder about.
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:40:17
You make it sound so simple!
@_date: 2014-05-17 09:38:42
Do you ever look in Most people seem to believe we will begin trending upwards after we go sideways for a bit.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:44:46
As far as I can see, this all exists in your imagination right now.
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:59:38
I think it's going to pop back down to 490-500 after this spike, I'm going to pick up another coin and then hodl at that point. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:53:43
Also, whoever is buying these is not going to turn around and dump them on the market all at once to crash the price. I think most likely they are anticipating BTC push up into another bubble in the future, taking us into 2000-4000 range where BTC can have the market cap it needs to be really useful. That's just my train of thought.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:43:07
This is the world we are already living in. Bitcoin is not going to change the desire of humans or the nature of humans on this planet. It is just a better reserve currency than government fiat because it is peer to peer and it CAN'T be manipulated by humans. People have free will, it seems like you struggle with that concept. People can do what they want and are free actors.
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:45:06
Interesting connections, thanks.

I have done a few trades to prevent loss. I pulled out when I knew a big drop was coming and then bought in low a few times. Basically I increased my holdings a bit by doing that.

The risk to reward ratio is really good. It is obvious that some in Wall St are going to get in on this, whether it is a pump and dump is unknown but BTC is just getting started.
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:05:18
I don't expect an up trend until July or August. I think it could dip to 380 one more time before then. I am all in right now because this is low either way.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:41:32
If someone wanted to do that I'm sure they could find a way.

I like and I visit that sub everyday. It's definitely true that nobody there can predict the future. It really just helps to get all that past and present data presented in front of yourself so you have maximum information and other people to discuss it with.

There is not much evidence to support sexuality being genetically determined. Genetics is not very well understood at all. Sexuality is a mystery. However, the evidence mostly suggest that it is a mix of predetermined traits, cognitive and behavioral, etc, basically every factor that exists can be mixing together here. This is why reductionist science does not work in psychology.
@_date: 2014-07-10 08:57:12
What I mean is, it's not entirely pre-determined, genetics is not absolute. But as you point out, it's clear that people do not choose what they are attracted to, which raises moral questions. I believe in treating everyone humanly, regardless of how taboo the issue. However, most of the prevailing cultures of the world are not so enlightened, people always want a witch hunt.
