That is a valid point - but it is not specific to Bitcoin.
Any company - small or big - can burn clients or shareholders, as it happened in the past.
The Bitcoin exchanges are small startups, with no protective regulations so far - they are obviously more risky than banks - although even Lehman could bite the dust.
Everything around BTC is high risk - you need the right tolerance to handle it. If it is stresses you out, you should not put your money in it, of course, that's the standard advice for all financial products.

Legal tender vs legitimate tender
Since Bitcoin has not been created by the government, it is not controlled by the government, it is basically absurd for a government to recognize it or not as a legal tender.
The astonishing attribute of BTC is that it is fully operated by individuals or businesses, who recognize it among each other as legitimate tender.

BTC will change regulators - beside many other things. 
For starter, the US government will not be able to send a regulator ON SITE at the BITCOIN HEADQUARTERS. 
More importantly, regulators will not be able to threaten with lawsuit Bitcoin, and Bitcoin can not settle.
"Bitcoin" is basically an unprecedented entity, without legal standing. It is outside of the legal system - as it does not exists in the current legal framework. All the regulators can go after is the BTC to fiat gateway. But in worst case BTC can go to full in-person, cash transaction. Good luck with banning the use of cash - or banning the meeting of two citizens just to regulate Bitcoin.
All they have to fight is Bitcoin user voting citizens, who pay the regulators salary by their taxes.

Apple is making the classic Microsoft mistake: it creates her own fully controlled ecosystem. 
For Microsoft the result was to unable to recognize that the Internet is way bigger than the MSN network "internet clone" could ever be. As a result, Microsoft locked herself out of the future of IT.
On the other hand Internet enabled Linux to exist and bloom to the point that now the Internet runs on Linux and virtually all recent IT innovation (virtualization, big data, etc.) is built on Linux.
It is impossible not to see that Bitcoin and Linux has the same fundamental DNA. 
Linux also does not have a headquarter, it could not be sued out of existence and it is powered by the voluntary will of people, around the globe - regardless of nation state and corporate borders.

The point is not whether BTC is "not inflationary" or "deflationary" (compared to the dollar). 
The point is to understand why economist think that properly functioning money should be able to be inflationary, as a tool to support economic policies, aimed at distributing money.
This is not a "nice story for idiots" - it is the story that results in printing and injecting 75-85 billion dollar a month, just into the US economy for several years now - in my view mistakenly. 
Policy makers, economists are trying to "fix" the broken "money distribution" by printing money, but the "money distribution" is broken by the shift to "labor market-less" economy - not because the money is not cheap or available enough.
If they realized this, it would not be an important criteria for a "usable money" to be inflationary in order to be able to serve fiscal policy.

Bitcoin is not inflationary, which is the basic headache for many economist, who see devil in deflation and in Bitcoin.
But they are fundamentally wrong. 
Here is the argument for putting more money in the economy, by printing it at will:
“But more productivity just creates more goods that noone can afford to buy, crashing prices and making the deflation even worse. It’s a vicious circle.
This is why we need more money in circulation. But we need money that is fairly distributed.”
I found this part very interesting: more productivity creates more goods that noone can afford – crashing prices lower – THIS IS WHY WE NEED MORE MONEY IN CIRCULATION.
I think putting more money in circulation is simply avoiding the fundamental contradiction, that noone (I know of) can resolve within the framework of the current socio-economic system.
In this system all investment is fundamentally serving one goal: increasing productivity. Whether it is a new product or service or the production of an old product or service.
The most important way to increase productivity is to eliminate human labor – as much as possible. This is the most deflationary part of the current socio-economic system, since human labor is actually the customer who buys the products. Eliminated human labor is non-purchasing customer.
It is not accidental that we are having unprecedented strange things in the economy now: the labor market is melting down due to unprecedented technological advance. The melt down is not temporary – it is just the beginning, temporarily buffered by cheap Asian labor.
Personally, I would encourage the speeding up of eliminating the labor market, by accelerating automation, robotics, as much as possible. There is no point of fighting it with temporary “job creation” incentives, by wasting more tax payers money, trying to turn back the clock.
In reality, only those jobs should be filled with humans, which still can not be automated or done by robots.
This would, of course, need to eliminate the entire, historical human experience, ideology, economics, politics of “people have to work for living”.
Of course, the current system can not do it – as this is the basic mechanism of – in lack of better term – distributing money to consumers, by some kind of rule (“market economy”).
The problem with putting more money in circulation (in order to defeat deflation) is that deflation is caused by transforming to “labor-marketless” society, which malfunctions the money distribution mechanism. Not because there is not enough money in the system.
If you eliminate most of the labor market (you automate most of production) it does not matter how much more money you put into the system – as the money distribution is broken. 
The money will just stay there “undistributable” – which is happening already, bank landing is sinking, although we have never had more money available in the system.
So what now?
It is not accidental, that the idea of “guaranteed income – decoupled from participating in the labor market” has surfaced just now.
It is basically an attempt to introduce a new money distribution system,
Completely removed from the labor market.
Coincidence? I don’t think so.
Now, let’s look at Bitcoin in this new context.
As part of the new money distribution system. 
Suddenly it does not seem to matter that much at all that Bitcoin IS deflationary (as you can’t put as many of it into the system as central banks want to, in order to create financial policy to “stimulate economy” – which is basically a code word for an attempt to distribute money [which used to be distributed by the now broken labor market], in order to enable consumers to buy, so that the economy does not stall.)
I think Bitcoin is just a symptom of the shift of paradigm – not in payment system, not in money – but the entire socio-economy, ideology of the “labor market-less” society.
Society v 2.0
Probably the biggest intellectual challenge in history. Technology is easy.

I am not sure if I understand you correctly - I know way too little about the tech details.
Let me approach the problem from an other angle then. 
Can Bitcoin detect if any of the miner/pool is reaching the 50% threshold? Or Bitcoin is not aware of this, only the outside observer?
If Bitcoin is able to detect the 50% threshold, could it raise artificially much higher the difficulty, effectively choking mining, thus encouraging pools to reorganize themselves in order to let the difficulty drop back?
If Bitcoin is not able to monitor the 50% threshold, could an external service do it for Bitcoin and initiate Bitcoin to choke mining by raising difficulty artificially high?

Krugman is looking for the floor value of Bitcoin.
Krugman explains: "Underpinning the value of the dollar is a combination of (a) the fact that you can use them to pay your taxes to the U.S. government, and (b) that the Federal Reserve is a potential dollar sink and has promised to buy them back and extinguish them if their real value starts to sink at (much) more than 2%/year (yes, I know)."
Basically for Krugman the floor value of dollar is 
a) the government ability to collect taxes without receiving plenty of chickens, goats 
b) the Federal Reserve promised to buy them back...
I am not sure how collecting tax gives value to a currency - it does not make it gold for sure.
The Federal Reserve buy back argument is even more interesting, considering that The Fed is privately owned entity. I would be curious, how would The Fed buy back trillions of dollars if everybody wanted to get rid of it, because the value dropped more than 2%? And what would The Fed pay for the dollar? Gold? Does The Fed own enough gold to cover all the dollar it prints? Then what is Krugman talking about?
Considering the floor value of dollar explained above, the floor value of Bitcoin seems way more real to me. 
The floor value of Bitcoin is not centered around government tax collection and a private entity, which has no ability to do what it is promising. 
The floor value of Bitcoin is people around the world, accepting Bitcoin to play the role of making payments for products and services among the members of the community - without the need of the assistance of any third party. The community is open for anyone, people or businesses can join and participate, regardless of their location, nationality.
It sure sounds more solid floor value to me than a government tax  collection (which by the way BTC can also do, actually cheaper, more transparently than the dollar) - or a shady privately owned organisation, The Fed, which is clearly not in the position to buy back the US dollar, if it ever came to that.

When I signed up to a BTC exchange, they asked me to provide pretty much everything you would need to open a bank account ("Know Your Client").
The BTC exchange can most definitely connect my identity to wallets where I transfer to or from bitcoins - at least one of them is probably my wallet.
This makes me question the anonymity if you ever trade on an exchange. Even using localbitcoins leaves your digital footprint - unless you can keep your email untraceable.
Once you bought your BTC on an exchange, you can of course create a new wallet and just transfer BTC directly.
But if NSA collects all network traffic data between different wallets and other unrelated data that can tie you in time, location, etc, to a wallet transaction, it is probably possible to get a sense who owns which wallet.
I am curious if I am wrong.

@_date: 2013-12-03 04:32:06
These are great questions - and really at the heart of bitcoin at this moment.
At this point the most important thing for bitcoin to be able to start working as a payment method between individuals and businesses.
Privacy is almost secondary, I don't even know if it exists - the exchanges I signed up with collected pretty much everything a bank would to open a fiat account.
Once you start moving bitcoins in and out of the exchanges, the exchange will have the data that which wallet address is connected to which verified user.
Replacing dollar or other fiat is also a long shot - before anything like that happens, bitcoin should be able to fully function for anyone who wants to use it.
The BTC/fiat gateway is one of the weakest link at this moment. This is the part which resists the most automation - unless using ATMs, which won't happen overnight.
I am sure plenty of people would like to buy into BTC, but getting verified on an exchange takes extreme long time - clearly fiat is finding difficult time to get into BTC right now.
A clearing system, that could match the in/out going fiat internally would be very useful.

After all, legal Canadian businesses need to have bank accounts in order to conduct business - which is the reason why they exist.
The big Canadian banks could find themselves in a legal hot water if someone pursue the case.

That's a good use :)

A good, working, easy BTC/fiat gateway, where BTC and fiat can flow smooth.
That would allow to create the critical mass for BTC to be able to start functioning as a currency, so users will feel less and less the need to move in and out to fiat.

Absolutely. Mods, please!

VoS is great!

mBTC makes it feel more real and it will make it more accessible for the masses, who can't drop $1000 on BTC, while it feels surreal to buy 0.00000001 (or whatever) BTC.

I would rather see you and me and the rest of VoS customers complain - after all, if we need to do wire transfer or certified cheque, we are forced to use a more expensive service, while other customers, dealing with other accounts have the cash deposit available.
VoS is also in a more delicate situation - I think customers wanting to use cash deposit have a better upper hand in the situation.

You get them because you have some money that you can afford to spend (and even lose) on a highly speculative, but extremely interesting social/financial/technical experiment - that may be financially rewarding. 
If you want instant gratification, you can buy BTC at localbitcoin.com. You will pay some premium for the speed and relative simplicity of the transaction.
Then you have a BTC.
You install a piece of software, called wallet and transfer your BTC to your computer.
You read up a bit about wallet, etc. You will also read up on BTC.
You may stop there and see what the future hold. Your BTC can go to zero or to the Moon in the next months, years.
You may also get more curious, excited after reading up on BTC and you may decide to get more involved. You can join one of the exchanges and you can actively trade BTC. Ideally, you would also start using BTC as a form of payment and even more ideally, as a currency. 
Your financial reward would be the highest, if you eventually never had to move your BTC back to fiat currency. 
By then the whole world has changed around you - and you were part of making the change.

A deposits $500, buys 1 BTC @ $500.
One months later A sells 1 BTC @ $1000 to B. In order for B to purchase 1 BTC, B had to deposit at the exchange $1000.
When A withdraws $1000, the exchange transfers A, the $1000, deposited by B, to buy BTC from A.

Sorry to hear about your story.
1) don't invest in anything that you can not lose.
2) you should build up your position gradually - that can help not to get in on the top.

Apple is not an elected, democratic institution.
Your only effective petition is to not buy the Apple product that does not meet your needs.

It is more of a concern.
JPM and WS can throw any amount of FED fiat to set up mining operation with the purpose of spoiling the game.

The BTC community should contact Bloomberg (and other media outlets) and point out every single disputable issues. Hosts, reporters need the support of the community, so they can point out when their guests are wrong. It is a matter of educating the media, public, politicians, decision makers. It is very important to do it.

And BTC is a perfect medium to pay taxes, as well... to any government... transparently and cheapest way possible, saving for tax payers.
