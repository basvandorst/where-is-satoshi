That only works if your coin is already on an exchange and if the recipient is willing and able to accept ltc. 
If it's in a personal wallet, the only way to get it off is by making a ledger transaction with some kind of fees and waiting.

Sorry man, it's from a David Mamet penned play/more popular movie about selling real estate. "Glengarry/Glen Ross"
You've actually provided far more detail and evidence that your property is in fact real and at least not completely flooded, but the thought of buying a property like this harkened back to the film for me. 
Best of luck, that seems pretty reasonable for an acre but I do live in an area where a wooded acre would cost closer to half a mill anyway

No bitcoin mining fees on exchanges, but there are still trade fees, depending on your transaction and exchange. On gdax, no fee on limit trades (maker) but the market price trades carry the fee (taker). On binance fees are .1% for everything (I think.05% if you use BNB for fees, not sure)

Hey I bought an xbox on newegg a month or so ago, using bitcoin. It was awesome.

I think the fact that you can throw
$500 at something, get 25000 units or whatever, and maybe it goes up from 5 cents to 10 cents,maybe 20, maybe you get extremely lucky and it hits a buck, or maybe it goes down to 0 and you're out 500 bucks worst case. It's not a bad bet at this point. 
I like and own btc, but there are profits in shit coins right now. And there ~~are~~ were a few last week that had pretty interesting use cases at very reasonable prices. Those prices have accordingly skyrocketed.

Every transaction you make is absolutely the wrong one, on a short timeline (you'll never hit the perfect short term top or bottom). But its not like the spin of a roulette wheel or hand of blackjack, you still hold coins, they just rise and fall where you don't want them. If your timeline is longer (hours, days) things have been steady enough to repay reasonable bets (ie, don't get caught buying at an ATH) with reasonable gains. Can make 10-20% easy, in a couple hours, sometimes less, sometimes more, if you pay decent attention and have reasonable goals. 
Can lose that too, but unless the coin fucking tanks (hasn't really happened yet, has it?), its unlikely to destroy your nut.

It's an interesting conundrum. On one hand, bitcoin is viewed as an investment and tax regulations seem to want to view it as such. But its also a currency that can be used for purchase or changed into other currencies. If I purchased an xbox on the internet using euros I wouldn't pay capital gains taxes on the USD/EUR exchange rate, so I don't think it would apply to BTC/USD either*, but if I day traded on the currency exchange from EUR to USD, I'd pay capital gains on that, right?
*someone somewhere in the IRS is working to change that

So that fee is roughly similar to what I've seen moving from gdax, and I've done a number of transactions that cost roughly that. The cost doesn't really scale because it's based on the memory size of the transaction (how many bytes it takes up) not how many coins or portions thereof are being moved. This makes it prohibitive if you are only moving $10. If you're moving $10,000, the fee is downright negligible. 
It's the same issue that prevents bitcoin from being a reasonable method to pay for coffee but perfectly acceptable to pay for electronics merchandise or whatever that might be a significant cost in fiat.

I'm largely hodling what I have at this point but I wanted to try out some of the currency "features" of bitcoin and happened to need a new 4k DVD player, so I bought an xbox one on new egg and paid in btc. That was at 10500 per coin a couple evenings ago. Then I bought some to replace what I spent (plus extra) when it was down around 9400 yesterday. Instant 10% off sale on the merchandise. 
Incidentally I was kind of amazed just how easy it was to use as payment. With fees it still isn't useful for a small transaction like coffee, but for buying a ~~$189~~ $169.20 game system its a really simple and effective method of payment.

I sent a low fee transfer (.2mbtc total fee, I think it was like 30 sat/byte) to myself on a different wallet that didn't clear for a while, then I forgot about the change being involved in that tx and sent two more, one with another tiny fee (.06mbtc....whoops) by mistake and a third with a reasonable fee (.77mbtc ) that required both of the previous parents to clear. I didn't think that any were going to clear, but miraculously they did. I guess the last one was lucrative enough for the former but that surprised me.

I was going to post a comment about bitcoin, then realized I was actually in the bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:43:15
Sure! I am both uniquely qualified to walk you through it, as well as severely underqualified to tell you that this 100% is the right way, being that I actually only learned how to do this a couple weeks ago and while I've tried to read up on every aspect of the process that I can, I am certain that there are details I miss. That said, the more I've read and - this is important - tried myself, the more I've felt comfortable with the process. I may have insight that feels second nature to a veteran of bitcoin but that is completely foreign to someone who hasn't done this before. I hope I can help you, but in that, I hope I can better my knowledge so that I can explain it to whomever is lucky enough to get a paper wallet gift from me this Christmas. Isn't that the tough part? Knowing enough to explain it to someone who knows only that bitcoin seems to be worth more and the newspeople are talking about it. 
Here goes...
I use bitaddress.org to generate a paper bitcoin wallet. There are some precautions that you may decide to take - going offline after loading the site, using a hard wired printer not a network one, generally doing this type of thing on private computers and networks that you or only those extremely close to you have access to, but I'm not a security expert and I think that most people don't have a reason for hackers to have installed a keylogger or something on their home computers. I wouldn't do it at work where there was an IT team or group printers though. 
On bitaddress, you move your mouse, or type random keyboard keys, and it generates a random bitcoin address. When you get to 100% it will show you a new page. it looks like [Example paper wallet](
You can print that page and that's all you need to have a wallet. the bitcoin address or public key is labeled "share". this is what you will use for an address to send bitcoins to. 
The private key is labeled "secret" and this is what you would use if you decide to spend or transfer your coins out of this wallet. You can make it pretty for printing by selecting the tab that says "paper wallet" as opposed to "single wallet" as well. 
Paper wallets are basically one time use for spending, since inputting the full private key into some other system compromises any coins that might be left in the wallet, and while that does require someone else to actually go about stealing it, its so easy to create new wallets that its just solid practice to wipe the wallet and transfer the coins to a new one when you find that you want to use a portion of it. There are good apps like electrum or others that facilitate daily use better than a paper wallet, so its easy to just move the coins to those if they are for spending cash. A paper wallet is more like a safety deposit box where you don't need access on any sort of regular basis. And an excellent vessel for giving. 
Speaking of transferring, how does one go about transferring bitcoin to a paper wallet? Easy! You can do it from Coinbase, GDAX etc by withdrawing to a bitcoin address. The address is the public key marked "Share" (again, never enter your private secret key anywhere unless you intend to move coins OUT of your paper wallet). You can check the transaction and also the status of your paper wallet by entering the public address on a place like blockchain.info. It might take a little while to get confirmed (average of 10 or 20 minutes - or more depending on the fees charged when transferring, but thats a different discussion) but you should be able to take a look at your paper wallet public address any time you like and see your coins sitting in that wallet. Its like checking your bank account, but its easier and anyone else that decided to check that address could see that you (anonymous "someone", in this case) have X number of coins in that location. 
You can transfer from a wallet like electrum too. Its the same process as transferring your coins off an exchange like GDAX to your electrum, but I'll walk you through because I'm learning too by doing this and putting thoughts to paper (er, Reddit). 
Print the wallet. In the app where you currently have coins stored, go to where you can send coins. Scan the QR code (much better than entering it by hand) and check the first bunch of characters and the last bunch. If they match the wallet address, you are going to be fine. Then go ahead and send the bitcoin. In electrum, you have a pin code required, in some other things like GDAX there will be an authentication two step method, in addition to being signed into your account. Etc. 
There will be a fee. you will pay it. I just paid $3.88 on a $50 transfer to a paper wallet i set up. Steep, i know, but I think its a worthwhile cause. 
Check the transaction on blockchain.info by entering your public key in the search bar and see when it gets confirmed and your wallet address with the amount you transferred to it. 
Gift the paper wallet, hopefully with a decent primer on what to do with it, if you have a bitcoin newbie as your giftee. Then enjoy helping them along the bitcoin road. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:59:46
The key for me in spending it (and as you say, it doesn't make sense for small transactions, regardless) is just replacing what you just spent, maybe even taking a bit of short term chance that it goes down between your purchase and when you buy back. But it's not attractive to simply spend it right now
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:05:51
This is a thing. You are the one in the know, as it were. You are the one who set up the wallet, gave the recipient the fucking keys. You had them. Keep them. Don't fuck with them but know that the recipient can either learn enough to transfer to a new wallet (or spend or put on an exchange etc) or not know enough to do anything except forget that those keys are actual money. Help them out and keep them, just with a level of trust that you intended when you actually gave the gift.

Gdax has fees (they are very reasonable either way) if you want instant buys or sells at the market rate. If you set a limit buy or sell order, even if it's a relatively small move away from current market rates, you are considered the maker and the person buying at market pays the fees on that transaction as the taker. 
Set a limit buy for a bit lower than current price, or wherever you want to buy at, and no fees. Set a limit sell for higher than current market and no fees. 
Fire sell on the downswing, or catch the falling knife that just stated going back up? Market buys and you'll pay the fees. Stop orders are also market orders with fees, they are just automatic. 
The fees aren't anywhere close to coin base though, not too much concern.

I realize, I think, that this site is one of the trusted ones, since I see it recommended on here often, but how does one know that (in general)? It seems trivial that, despite the site's own claims that it does not have access to the address generated, a site would have your qr code and address since it served the damn thing. I think I understand that their code is open source, verified, etc but there is a level of trust on that end that I'm conditioned to not give in this world of crypto.

I own fractional shares of a number of different funds, including an sp500 index, and various mutual funds. I consistently reinvest dividends which are never conveniently at the current share price, and when I bought into a number of these, it was for rounded whole dollar amounts, rounded generally to the 1000. So I feel confident that you can easily buy fractional shares of a lot of different investments. Maybe the issue is buying less than a single share? Not sure I've tried that.

@_date: 2017-11-15 04:22:32
Is coinbase going to send any tax correspondence? It's rather complicated to determine cost basis, profit, loss, how long an asset was held etc, once you have made more than a few transactions. Even more difficult if coins were moved into coinbase from elsewhere, moved off to wallets, spent, or even just shuttled between exchanges. 
This is unlike regular investing in so many ways, even though on the surface it seems similar. 
I can't spend my apple shares on pizza without first selling them. And there is zero mechanism to determine whether a user is merely hodling offline or if he spent them, and even less so to say what the value was at the moment they were spent or sold. 
I'm trying to wrap my head around reporting even my modest gains from selling a bit here and there and buying drops. Like portions of coins at a time. It took quite a bit of adding and subtracting to even get my cost basis from current holdings and that doesn't say anything about my tax exposure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:48:42
I'm a bit of a newbie as well but essentially Coinbase is a simple platform that charges ticketmaster-esque fees for the convenience. Gdax is like going to the box office directly. Since it's simply different web addresses and the sites are interchangeable (and free instant transfers between the sites) there isn't a ton of need to use Coinbase for anything.
One possible exception is instant buys of btc from bank accounts, credit cards, wire transfers at market rates (with fees) that let you get in even if you don't have USD on an exchange ready to go. But it takes a week or so to actually get your coins once the transaction clears. Not sure you can do that on gdax, but wouldn't really surprise me if you could
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:36:43
Which you should anyway because there are no fees on limit buys or sells.Just market and stops and they are very low for those too, especially compared to coinbase.

At the time my biggest nightmare was somehow I copied the receive address wrong. It was never listed as confirmed by sender, then I would have actually pooped, but it's still unnerving until it shows up (even unverified) in the wallet. 
Took about 30 minutes, but as a transferring-off-gdax virgin I was slightly nervous. 
Incidentally, if sent to the wrong address, if it's a typo, it's unlikely to be a real wallet. Can a real wallet be set up using that typo and the funds retrieved?
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:31:44
Ha! Who knows? 
Fwiw, I sold at 8036 (it was at about 8050, but this is after fees) and I'll probably sit on the cash until it gets back to the 7500 mark or so. Of course I could be 100% wrong and this is going to 10k and I blew another 2000 USD selling a coin...
You never know. I feel good about the sale though, personally.

Yeah. I educated myself on some various wallets etc and moved about 1.5 BTC from gdax to a wallet last night in 2 transactions. The first, for .03 (strictly as a test, albeit a $200+ test) cleared very quickly and I felt safe to do the rest....took a while and I'm tripping a bit, knowing full well I did everything the same and correctly, but still crapping my pants just in case.

There are a lot of places that tried stuff like that and don't do it any longer because of loss control. That is to say, people steal shit, and it's way easier to do so when you are self checking out.

2% of earnings or portfolio? The former is an amazing deal better than the lowest cost admiral index fund from vanguard (very small investment being the exception due to the flat fee). The latter is pretty much criminally overpaying unless your guy is Madoff levels of good, while still being legit, of course. 
Either way that fee is an outlier. 
If it's the first one (what you stated), I would like to trade my 1% flat fee (on portfolio) advisor for your guy, but I'm still putting the bulk of my investments into the vanguard admiral funds (and bitcoin!).
