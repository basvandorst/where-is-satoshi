Ok so here's a quick and dirty algorithm (Note: It is probably more efficient to use a language's built-in matrix class)..
* read in the latest version of oxford dictionary into an array of words (I believe another user has already provided a source for this)
* read in an "older" version of oxford dictionary into array of words (the older you go the better your chances of finding the password but at a significant time cost)
* calculate the array difference: recently_added_words = latest_version_words - older_version_words (Note: maybe there's a source that lets you start immediately with just the recently added words).
* recently_added_words_1 = recently_added_words.random_sort
* recently_added_words_2 = recently_added_words.random_sort
* recently_added_words_3 = recently_added_words.random_sort
* for i = 0 to 9
  * for each word1 in recently_added_words_1
     * for each word2 in recently_added_words_2
         * for each word3 in recently_added_words_3
             * passphrase = word1word2word3i
             * try it now (

Yeah I think you are failing to calculate this correctly, and repeating your comment over and over makes you look incredibly foolish.  Lets see if you'll even spend 30 seconds to try and understand:
The average price of BTC during 2013 was around $200.  So $200 he earned last year, at current rates is worth $550 today.  It is true that what he earned in November and December is now only worth half, but what he earned in January through October is worth much much more.  Overall he is way up.

I explained exactly how I made that jump: by assuming that you had respected the perspective of the original post, which you did not.  That is why a misunderstanding occured.  You then proceeded to be quite insulting and demanding of an explanation, which I have given and now repeated.  We both made a jump.  And you're the one who made a logical fallacy by saying "your clients were at no point vultnerable to heartbleed bug".  Oh no?  Not even when they logged into other websites that you had nothing to do with?  It is nitpicking, but you made the logical fallacy and accused me of doing that.
Now you have a choice to make:  you can realize that you were at least partially to blame in this misunderstanding, you overracted and displayed some degree of hipocracy, recognize that and grow as a person.  OR, you can choose to continue being offended and wanting to be the smartest one in the room but ultimately looking like a fool.

yes, that is what "net neutrality" means.  But the bill that is currently being put forth is a perversion of the term.  It proposes that sites can pay for preferential bandwidth.  Meaning companies with money will get a speed advantage over your website.

I'm afraid obamacare is also anti-libertarian.  It forces everyone to pay for an insurance policy that may or may not suit them.  Thanks for the tip, and I support your journey.  disclaimer: I am not a US citizen and I have not looked very deeply into this net neutrality bill, but my sources tell me it is the same thing that was put forth last year, which was an anti-neutral farce and thankfully shut down by the american people.

I will balance that by saying that investing generally should not involve emotions.  Its the quickest way to get burned.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:37:37
I will go out on a limb and suggest that as long as there is someone willing to pay $0.01 for BTC, then a single miner could still profit by producing 25 BTC every minute, for a profit of $0.25 per minute (minus electricity costs which would be negligible at this level).  Of course in this scenario, the network is very vulnerable, but the system will theorically continue as long as someone is willing to buy BTC.
This is just conjecture in the interest of provoking someone more knowledgable to chime in :)

That's what it sounds like to me too.  I just hope there's checks and balances in place to prevent a bot like Willy that can get away with only selling :/

Anyone who felt like an early adopter buying after the price passed $600 on the way up was wearing rose tinted glasses.  I feel for them, but they had to realize that buying on such a tremendous all-time high could go either way for them.  And I still think they'll be fine long term.  They are only financial ruined if they put all their faith in Gox, and that really begins to stretch the definition of early adopter.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:45:28
First he divulges how much he lost on Gox here in reddit.  Then the first question in the interview is "how much did you lose?  was it X amount?"
Evoorhees doesn't get flustered and answers truthfully.  Then he comes back on reddit and gets ask how much of his total BTC holdings was X?  Erik should not have answered that question in my opinion, yet he did for some reason.
Now yourself and rufusthelawyer have decided to take it one step further and that Erik should divulge his personal net worth right here on in this thread.

afaik Buttercoin was conceived about a year ago, after the last goxxing or failure of a major exchange (can't remember which one) the idea(l) was a distributed exchange based on trust.  After this recent Wrath of Gox, I looked it up again and it seems the project is now more focused on creating a white label open source exchange type deal.  Still a cool thing, but not as cool or ambitious as the original concept, which I'm not even sure was possible.
EDIT: I don't think I'm teaching you anything, but the internets will now start to learn about buttercoin and maybe revisit the idea of building an exchange mechanism into the bitcoin protocol (or something fun like that, I've had a few frappuccinos today)

credit cards typically take $0.30 + 3% so that would leave btc-e with less than 2% 
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:58:58
But you agree its weird that the bot was previously buying AND selling, until March 2103 it started ONLY selling.  Bitcoin had just done a pretty impressive run up in the preceding year (from $5 to $50).  I can't help but wonder if Mark started to take a gamble with only selling.  The only thing that could have gone wrong is if the price kept going higher and higher and higher, reaching $1000 just 8 months later!

If they allowed payment with BTC they would lose their ability to claw back funds from the merchant, in other words they would have to turn their current business model upside down.  Also they would be putting their reputation on the line and possibly upset their largest "partners" in the payment world i.e. credit cards and acquiring banks.  No, they are much better to sit back and not mess with their cash cow.  A better idea (for them) would be to create a separate company that focuses on Bitcoin.

There's your answer, mostly.  It is interesting I suppose if there is a price at which all miners would close up shop, like for example could miners still make profit if BTC fell to $1 and remained there.
