And you didn't it receive it with the seal already broken? 
Unfortunately mine will be a museum piece. 
edit: just noticed there's a seal now on the USB itself.

Just in case anyone is interested in how this began:

Why should anyone be worried by the BTC-e crash?
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:02:06
Agreed. I had a good laugh.
Also, does anyone know who that Bitcoin-savvy rap artist is that plays at the end of the video?
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:19:28
I backed it. Can't wait for my device and shirt.

I think I saw him at the altcoin panel during the Texas Bitcoin Conf. Can someone else confirm this?

Don't forget Topman and Vanishing Elephant.

I'm probably going to get downvoted for this. 
When you're talking offline, are there text bubbles corresponding to the discourse into which to insert said bucks? Or, said another way, are there upvote/downvote arrows?
I liked your comment. I thought it was funny. I just think the analogy falls short of these differing natures of discourse. There's a separate consideration that can be made—for incentivizing quality content in a limitless open forum. Because of the duration and scope of such content, for its level of public scrutiny, and for the limited screen real estate public participants have in viewing discussion threads, you would want to reward content proportionally.
That said, in other AFK forums, be it conventions, summits, panel discussions, et cetera, you'll sometimes support the participants prior to the event, maybe in the form of admission costs. Similar concept, in that, quality content is rewarded proportionally. 
This has gotten a little long. So, instead of deleting it I will hit save.

I've seen Bitcoin tipping downvoted in other subs. I'm hesitant to do so, in part, because I view to be a nuisance to others.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:12:00
Just. Wow.

Is it a good idea to buy more Bitcoin now that the price is so low?
@_date: 2015-05-08 04:57:23
Damn, that is sexy looking.

Why does the site feature a rendering of the moon?
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:49:05
You're right. But the devs have talked with [CoinTelegraph]( Where they seem to suggest their reticence is a way to first "gauge market interest". ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
edit: which, on second thought, actually is strange since they instead chose to include fabricated customer feedback. Also, reading further there's mention of this "customer feedback".
update: [Definitely trolling (borg style)](

Well, they're not interchangeable terms. Virtual currencies are a subset of digital currencies. Think of the former as rupees from the Legend of Zelda or Vanguard/Crucible Marks from Destiny. 
Their representation is quasi-meaningful extension of their respective world. And, as part of this world, game devs are the ones who decide things like supply and valuation, making them centralized.

I agree that it's not bad. I almost shrugged this off thinking the piece was going to be a roundtable of talking heads spreading FUD. 
Now, I'm off to find a copy of that book. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:22:03
Wow, I didn't know either of these subs existed. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:40:48
I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....
edit: what little doubt there is.

Just tested it out. I didn't see any confirmation of it in the stream or my ChangeTip history.

Nice, OP. Still awaiting my Entropy in the mail. 
Never heard of the Piper though.

Lol, they've moved on from lossless compression.
@_date: 2013-08-30 08:43:32
You're right about this. But trying to explain Bitcoin as a legitimate form of exchange, as a p2p currency, is also frustrating especially since I do this AFK with people who have their own preconceptions and baseless reasons for not taking seriously any of the above. Here, at least, there is understanding. 
Your two cents is worth a lot since this is a forum for discussion and not a circle jerk.
