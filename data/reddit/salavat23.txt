There's another angle to this that I never see covered. There are a limited amount of Bitcoins out there. If everyone held onto their coins and limited selling activity, we'd be raising barriers for new folks joining the community because:
1. Less trading removes incentives from developers building better exchanges, wallets, and other infrastructure.
2. Less trading means less acceptance by merchants both online and offline.
3. Lower long term prices of Bitcoin because of  and 
I say this somewhat shamefully as a long-term holder having acquired my first Bitcoins early on. I don't think this is a healthy way for the community to move forward.

An event I stand by: last year I participated in this run and withdrew all my Bitcoin from QuadrigaCX (a popular Canadian exchange at the time). Literally a few weeks later, QuadrigaCX was shutdown and untold amounts of funds were lost. Take it seriously folks. :)

There are two sides to this. Sure inflation is a way to confiscate cash savings. But this confiscation, in return, stimulates consumer desire to spend and helps our collective economy chug along. 
It would be a painful (but maybe temporary) path to reverse course.

Mark didn't spend even a minute thinking about what he said. BTC has a market cap of $132 billion as of now. This means that consumers have actively chosen to sell $132 billion worth of other assets to purchase BTC.
