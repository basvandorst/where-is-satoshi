I’m just gonna transfer all the BTC out since I have the private key and I’m technically the owner since. Whoever holds the keys owns the BTC...

Bitcoin is a SORRY excuse for a currency. It is a slow fat sluggish POS that investors piled money into. 
We don’t use tube TVs anymore hence same  for outdated crypto. BTC is popular because it was the first. There are much better cryptos out there.

Fucking horrible idea. I can finally afford a Bitcoin now but I’m not buying as I literally have 4K to my name

Ummmm yes cash out and claim that loss on your taxes. The IRS makes you claim gains so stick it to the fuckers and claim your loss

So I could buy 1/2 a BTC but I think Cannabis stocks are gonna be much more profitable once true legalization happens. I’ll take my gains then and reinvest into BTC

The max you should ever invest is 1/2 your life savings. The Ogs go ham and all in but if they did that 6 months back and hodled they would be fucked

Best idea ever!!!
