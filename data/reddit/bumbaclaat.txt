I am not sure but I think the answer lies in  "For legal reasons, we can't call it unlimited data service"

the way I read it, the service continues..  if it doesn't throttle, cut off or charge you extra, then it continues.  what other possibilty is there


~~I don't know but I'm going to find out in a couple of days and will report back~~
edit:  I found [a datasheet for the device]( it takes a microSIM

If you look at the data sheet I linked to above, the device doesn't have ethernet.  It has USB that you can tether from, and wifi.   I will know more when mine comes in the mail in a couple of days.

I used to have Straight Talk..  Their plans are all "First 5GB Data at High Speeds then 2G"

I have Tmobile on my phone too - that is with throttling once you hit some limit, 2GB or 4GB

But isn't that what liquor and tobacco sellers do ? And that's legal.

For me, it totally is, but I don't have access to FIOS or Google fiber.  Maybe if I could get those I would opt for that, but then again the advantage of being mobile and online even when speeding down the highway, or wherever I sit and want to do work is worth *a lot*
I get around 15mbps down and 5mbps up consistently, and have gotten that all over the country
And getting to support a non-profit that runs Tor exit nodes and their encrypted Jabber service and other projects gives me a good feeling
