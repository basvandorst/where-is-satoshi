Yea. Either way, two changes, not 6. :/

make uninstall also works...unlike windows, (well formed, such as bitcoin) makefiles don't leave shit hanging around.

While I'm happy someone caught this, I'm minorly annoyed that it appears 4 lines of code are wrong, but in reality, all you are changing is a single &amp;&amp; to an || (and to or). That's it. That's the entire change once you unwrap all the formatting tweaks he made.

Chainsplit != hard fork. You need to understand the difference because it matters and the term 'hard fork' cannot be thrown around.
Soft fork / chainsplit: Two parallel chains exist, a-legacy and b-new, but almost everyone agrees that one chain is superior to the other, thus, the small number of people on the legacy chain suddenly have a very good reason to upgrade to the b-new chain, because only a handful of nodes and possibly no miners are actually making blocks for the a-legacy chain.
hard fork: Two chains exist without a sufficient motivator for either chain to die off. BU and BTC are an example of this. BU intends to fork and continue, and BTC plans to endure a possible fork and continue. Thus, two longest chains remain active going forward.
The truest truth of what causes a blockchain to be accepted as 'the longest chain', and therefore the correct chain, is buried in a few function calls in the Bitcoin Core code I haven't read closely.
The idea behind BIP148 is that enough nodes will upgrade to encourage a softfork by showing people demand, rather than support, the implementation of Segwit. 
Last time I checked, a few days ago, there were around 55 BIP148 nodes. Let's...actually, let's go through a walkthrough of what would happen on August 1.
Bitcoin Core client:
* July 31 23:59:59: Head = 1233, block comes in (prev = 1233), not signaling Segwit support. Block is validated and added to the blockchain. Head = 1234
* August 1 00:10:00: head = 1234, Block comes in (prev = 1234), not signaling Segwit support. Block is validated and added to the blockchain. Head = 1235
* August 1 00:20:00: head = 1235, Block comes in (prev=1235), signaling Segwit support. Block is validated and added to the blockchain. Head = 1236
BIP148 client:
* July 31 23:59:59: head = 1233, block comes in (prev = 1233), not signaling Segwit support. Block is validated and added to the blockchain. Head = 1234
* August 1 00:10:00: head = 1234, Block comes in (prev = 1234), not signaling Segwit support. Block is rejected. Head = 1234
* August 1 00:10:05: head = 1234, Block comes in (prev = 1234), signaling Segwit support. Block is validated and added to the blockchain. Head = 1235
*August 1 00:20:00: head = 1235, block comes in (prev = 1235; but the hash is the 1235 signature that the core nodes accepted, not the hash accepted at 00:10:05), signaling Segwit support. Block rejected -&gt; incorrect previous block.
And so on. Blocks will be rejected from the BIP148 chain unless they are built on the previous BIP148 block AND they signal segwit support. This is why this plan only works with a majority of node supports. If only 50 nodes want to enforce BIP148 come august, there will be no point in continuing to run them; they'd be off on their own little 50-man chain.
Both the MASF and the UASF require popular support to be implemented, they just go about attaining/'having' that popular support in different ways.
By all means, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe my explanation is technically correct. I do not claim expertise in block validation (outside of the specifics of what change was made to create BIP148).

It doesn't cost $2000 and a 1 year ROI to setup a BIP148 node.

Technically? Any percent will work. After 51% miners refusing to signal segwit support will be stuck on the shorter chain as most blocks will be in the BIP148 chain, but the reason 51% and up isn't required is because having a block be rejected will cost the miners money. While two chains would exist at that point, if Segwit does eventually activate at some later point, and an obstinate miner fails to mine their blocks on the segwit chain, all coins earned after August 1 by that miner are unspendable on the segwit chain, because the coins only exist on the non-segwit chain.
It is to the miners advantage to not mine themselves into a corner.
