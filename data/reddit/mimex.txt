Where are you based?
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:23:17
Firstly, you shouldn't be trying to fight back. We all love bitcoin here - me included - but thats not how you should be thinking of things.
Second, Alipay doesn't let him send money all over the world without limits on destination or amount, does it?
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:25:51
I made a mistake
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:47:48
And we're out: 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:16:57
As far as I am aware - yes! In fact we have two partners domestically and two internationally. (Although one of our current domestic partners is a backup)

You can't, unless you can convince a pool owner to accept the new transaction.

I'm William, the Director of Mimex.
We are partnered with Unitransact, who are licensed by ASIC - and we share a director/investor with them.

Just working on the SSL cert, slightly intermittent.

If you want to buy coins in Canada, and don't want to pay a 6% fee (3% Circle CC fee, 3% currency conversion from your bank) sign up with Vault of Satoshi. Once verified you can deposit instantly through Interac online.

The Isle of Man is a crown dependency, just off the coast of the UK and may become the first country to accept bitcoin for taxes. They are connected to the UK banking system also.

And we're out: 
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:18:58
We launched this week and you can deposit via UK bank transfer
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:49:44
  
  
No verification process for less than £800, deposit via faster payments and very reasonable fees.  (£1 deposit, 0% maker 0.8-0.3% taker)
  
You just have to create an account with us and an account with our banking partner.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:14:57
It depends on the service. For example with an exchange they often have enough money that a largish mining pool could potentially make a profit through a one block double spend.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:36:29
You're right, but 0 fee trading means that most of the volume is just bots, whereas on exchanges like BitStamp with higher fees its generally people buying/selling.
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:05:02
I doubt it, although they will continue to shrink in terms of bitcoin stolen but increase in terms of $/£ stolen.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:20:57
Maybe you would like to give us a try? You can deposit via UK bank transfer.
@_date: 2014-11-23 02:25:13
Yes, I believe it is.
We've also launched this week for Aussies.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:25:19
We're not anonymous.
I'm William Dunne, our investors are UTA investments limited. 
Our details are on companies house, Mimex FS LTD
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:20:55
You can have an account.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:25:16
Mardica, and we have a backup that will be ready in about a month.
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:21:55
Okcoin does IIRC

His IP would get added to every blacklist under the sun, and using the internet would become a general hassle (for example accessing any site that uses CloudFlare)
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:29:23
Hey, sorry about the delay in response.
Its via UK bank transfer through our banking partner. It normally will cost £1 for deposits but our partner is currently waiving fees for our clients.
Here is our trade fee structure, I think it is very fair but I'll leave it for you to decide:
Link was to the dev server
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:59:19
Users are able to deposit via a variety of methods, including UK and Australian bank transfers, Crypto Capital accounts and international wire transfers.

Normally its a line about risk, not what is considered risk. They can use a broad term like that to stamp many activities as against the T&amp;Cs
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:02:12
You're right, my bad.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:21:06
Thank you for the plug @_date: 2014-11-22 11:05:30
Mimex.net does not charge GST, and fees start are 0.3-0% for makers 0.6-0.3% for takers but as we are new to the block we don't have much volume yet.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:24:08
We do at mimex.net! Our volume is currently low, but we're working on it and have a big liquidity partner coming in a couple of weeks.
