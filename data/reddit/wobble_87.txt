Moment of truth boys.
Been building steady for almost a month now until just now when someone(s) just tried to flashcrash the market.
If we hold here (6400) and then continue to build upwards again we'll have effectiveley set the first higher low in a long time.
Which in my opinion would be pretty bullish

The only thing more volatile than bitcoin in a bear market. Is bitcoin in a bull market. As fast as bitcoin falls it rises waaaay faster (when it really gets going)
I would rather rather see bitcoin hit 100k and then fall to 80k and sell then when the next bull market is 100% over than to start DCA selling all the way from 20k up to 100k.

No because in essence this isn't even a bitcoin question. You could replace bitcoin in your question with any asset or stock or publicly traded commodity and the answer would be the same.
I also get the feeling that the answer which is almost intuitive to most people would take forever to explain to you. Like trying to explain the colour purple to a blind child.

Greater than 1 as bitcoin is deflationary it would cause the worlds economy to almost grind to a halt. No one would want to buy shit.
 They would buy as little amount of shit as possible because they know their money would be worth double in relativeley  short amount of time.

Canadian here. Coinberry is garbage, they do the exact samr thing as shakepay but shakepay is cheaper.
I just downloaded thw coinberry app to compare the 2. The buy price on coinberry was just under 8850$/btc while it was just over 8450$/btc on shakepay.
Neither one of them has "fees" for traiding but Shakepay tells you straight up they get the best quotes from multiple exchanges and then they tack on 1.5% for themselves. Coinberry does the same but their cut is much much higher.

Bitcoin was created in response to the bailouts from the 2008 recession.
Since it's existence though the stock market and global economy have been in a bull run for the last 10 years. Most people have all heard that bitcoin is sound money, that it is hard money. They don't really understand what that means though or care as long as their FAANG stocks are growing.
Bitcoin will be bitcoin like never before during the next global recession. 
When shit hits the fan and everybody's life savings are dropping day after day there will be 2 green ticker symbols flashing on marketwatch gold and BTC and it won't be gold they run to this time.
TLDR: bitcoin will hit 1 million$ during the next global recession because it was born from a global recession and that's where it will shine brightest.

He phrased the question terribly but from what I understood he is basically asking the following hypothetical scenario.
if altcoin x suddenly becomes worth 0.5 bitcoin but has a supply over 100 million coins (so more than 5x the supply of bitcoin) how can we sell all the altcoins and convert it to bitcoin at that rate since there isn't enough bitcoin to do so.

2) he got a job
3) he bought da bitcoin
4) he ends with a cautionary warning to not buy bitcoin with a credit card.
I could see how one might assume he paid off his debt first before buying the bitcoin based on his reformed attitude. This is most likely false, the 40k debt is still there.

My eyes can't focus on the words on my screen too well.
Currently getting (HODL BiTCh, Death To No-Coiners) tatooed across my forhead.
The pain is a bit distracting.
Edit: grammar

That's his whole point bro. When Bitcoin becomes  the world reserve currency, that will end rampant consumerism as we know it due to it's deflationary nature.
See, who said bitcoin was bad for the environment.

Should reboot your pc every now and then.
Shit needs to update and whatnot.

I bought a fake breitling from china using bitcoin. Does that count as a sale?

Nothing at all good luck.
You might get lucky trying non-stop after 40 million years.

I have a decent paying job and no kids and no car payment, and no mortgage payment (I drive a piece of shit car and live in a piece of shit house).
I invested my entire life savings in bitcoin at just below 7k price earlier this spring and been buying ever since. Bought at 8k. 9k. 10k. 6k. 5k.
I'm still buying. I spend half my paycheque every 2 weeks buying bitcoin and i'll keep buying until i have enough bitcoin to live off of till I die.
I don't know the meaning of the word overextended. I have no debt and i hate buying new shit. All my money goes towards buying btc.
I only spend what I can afford to lose. Fortunateley for me, I can afford to lose everything.

Fuck the economy. Economic growth, kills the planet.

Anyone else afraid to go to sleep?
Wondering to yourself that if you stop staring at the ever moving price charts the spell will be broken?
I have to stare at my screen! The bullrun depends on it!!!
