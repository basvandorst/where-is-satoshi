No, it isn't useless and it won't drop to $0 (though a crash back into triple digits can't be ruled out), but it will never become mainstream.

I have to go to work right now so unfortunately I can't reply for another 8 hours or so. Hopefully someone else can give a good reply, if not I'll check back here and write something up.

Bitcoin has much bigger issues than the government not liking it.
--It's largely deflationary, which historically with national currencies discourages investment, reduces corporate profits, and increases unemployment. In short, if Bitcoin was the main currency it would seriously hinder economic growth.
--Its deflation/inflation rate is extremely volatile. The Bitcoin-USD conversion rate looks much more like a stock price than an inflation curve. How can you know how good of an investment you're making when you can't accurately predict the value of money in 5 years? You can't, and that's why that sort of chaos is terrible for a currency.
--Its inflation/deflation rate can't be regulated. For all people like to shit on the Federal Reserve, it's generally pretty great at keeping the USD inflation rate at a reasonable level. Same goes for the national banks of _most_ governments. But bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies can't be regulated in the same way by anyone, whether government or private. Yet another reason investors never prefer Bitcoin to USD.
--It can't be used to buy goods and services in most places. This is the most fundamental aspect that makes money money, and yet outside of some online vendors it's quite rare for businesses to accept Bitcoin. That probably isn't going to change unless businesses regarded bitcoin in the same way they do cash or credit, and Bitcoin's fundamental problems for investors as described above largely make that a pipe dream.
Blockchain is pretty cool and I wouldn't be surprised if it is integrated into national currencies, but Cryptocurrencies will never replace fiat money.
Also the rising price of Bitcoins is cool if you have Bitcoins only because an alternative currency exists. Bitcoin is undergoing hyperdeflation at a rate of roughly 85%, which would be economically devastating if it Bitcoin accounted for more than a tiny fraction of transactions.
