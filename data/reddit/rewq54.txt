Because you argue against the etf is one thing, obviously you don't understand why it is a good thing: it is an asset that can be liquidated immediately and be re-invested in stock, options, currency or any other asset that is available through the broker account, this gives it a great advantage which a tiny fee won't offset.

There is no gain or loss for either network, regardless of what currency is used, while your text is based on the opposite. Your % figures are off, it can be both lower, higher and anything in between. There is no information passed to the network regarding in what currency your account is denominated so it already works to pay in btc but not yet charge in it since the symbol isn't included yet.
Read your text again and replace all instances of 'bitcoin' with 'foreign currency' to get a better grip on reality.

Bitcoin is not a threat to paypal, banks, visa, mastercard or any other entity handling multi-currency accounts. If they integrate it it will just be with the same fees as with any other currency. If/when the market is big enough it will be integrated but right now it's not worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:43:50
They just need to link a bank account to an exchange to get the money out for a 1% withdrawal fee. It is not complicated to set up and bitcoins could be sent directly to the exchange so they don't need a wallet. You can handle that account yourself but for withdrawing you would need them to log in since a code will be sent by sms to verify (sms code also needed when registering account).
If you can get them to accept that or not will depend on the size of the company, type of company and what relation you have to them.

No, you deposit in euros and withdraw in euros, or you deposit and withdraw in btc, or a mix of the two. But for the first which is predicted to be dominant there is no difference to any other bank, what the bank does with my deposits are irrelevant to me (lending, investing, currency swaps) as long as I can withdraw what I deposited.
The only risk would be a total crash that lasts a very long period and the bank becomes insolvent. Since he makes claims of creating hedging possibilities with other financial actors this would mitigate that risk.

It's only a matter of electricity cost if you already have the miner. Either you run it or you don't. Resale value is irrelevant since selling only passes the equipment to someone else, therefore depreciation is also irrelevant.
At some point it will be too expensive to buy new equipment though and the difficulty will only rise if the usd price goes up. Even though difficulty and exchange rate are not directly related now the equipment cost will go down relative to price and will be more related in future.

Market share isn't just about volume traded. Also you can have daytraders and bots inflating numbers, exchanges can themselves fake trading which maybe all of them do but more likely smaller ones to create an illusion of an active site. Therefore I think the chart is kind of pointless.

Good idea but in current form easily manipulated by smallest exchanges. There needs to be a point where an exchange is not included, perhaps 1% of btc volume, otherwise the smallest can fake a small trade at a ridiculously high price to push the average. Can also be solved by excluding trades that deviates too much from the average, perhaps below/above 75%/150%.

But the bank account was probably emptied every day so there wouldn't have been much either, all money was flowing in one direction at the time, if knowing the inflow and time of crediting on gox one can possibly come up with a figure but it would be speculative.

I was a little sarcastic because there is no way that Starbucks will start taking bitcoins because of that petition.

Would be great to have both though, especially the banks.

Since gox is still the big dog, and all other rates depend on their rate, this is the de facto base rate. If an exchange is not taking place at gox you have to adjust for whatever positive/negative factor that influences the exchange at that place.

TA is used very much as you described and with the gains in fractions of a %. But that is in the traditional markets with people doing it for a living and being well paid for it. When it comes to bitcoin the TA that people present is basically like what I described above, but it is being presented as being very solid evidence, anyone can do it.
More seriously though: I really believe that the bitcoin market has neither the liquidity nor the maturity in order to profit from TA. As it is a new hybrid commodity/currency I also think that it will take quite a lot of serious research to understand what TA can be applied and not.

What very good alterrnatives? Exchanges has come and gone, sometimes taking the customers funds with them, during Gox lifetime. The alternatives lacks liquidity because noone trusts them with large amounts.
Since none of the smaller exchanges has ever had massive traffic it is impossible to tell if they have a better backend or not but I guess they would experience the same problems as Gox did.
They haven't had years to sort out regulatory because there haven't been any regulations until this year.
Saying that Gox has given bitcoin a bad reputation is just ridiculous. Outside US it would rather be US that gets the bad reputation and it might be for the best for everyone else if Gox stops serving US customers completely.

If you want speed then you send gox your wallet, i.e the private key, and then they have as many confirms as you do. All btc instantly available. Not sure if 10 mins is more helpful otherwise, reason to do quick transfer would be market crashing but then 10 mins will still be too long.
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:54:29
But the problem with a service like namecheap is that they have chosen 6 confirmations which is an arbitrary number and they could do with a lot less, 1 would be enough for them. But 6 is spread as a magic number which it isnt, it is just the point where it is unfeasable for someone with slightly less than 50% of the network to double spend, getting the word out that 6 confirms are not necessary would help a lot. If someone still want the 1h security it would still be 1h even with lower block time, it is all about the probability of staying ahead of the main, so double spend security is not affected by block time.

That reality is far away, very few if not non-existant are the merchants who can pay all expenses in btc directly or indirectly.
Bitcoin competes with credit cards and that is where the comparison must be. I.e. a card denominated in usd paying for goods denominated in eur, merchant only sees eur, customer sees usd. Not much difference.

Forexminute is promoting plus500 as affiliate. Plus500 deals with cfd, no actual bitcoins, so this is misleading.

The money and btc on the exchange is probably there, the deficit pushed into the 'withdrawal queue', so not really necessary to trade themselves and I think they want to avoid that.

Didn't downvote it but not upvoting either. Some countries can try to ban it but what is more important is which countries doing it. Would be very good for bitcoin future if North Korea, Iran and Cuba made it a crime and publicly executed people for posession since this would force the west to support it instead. If a western country try to ban it then it will be supported by the above instead. It is all about politics.

Even if 90% wouldn't touch anything with their name it still leaves 10%. If 0.1% of those want to invest it will be a considerable influx of money. It does bridge the gap between bitcoin and every investor in the world so even at 0.01% it is a mountain of money.

Very important project with great potential. It is a serious attempt to bring bitcoin to the masses but if it doesn't succeed then bitcoin will probably never be adopted by the masses.

And the troll argument would have been avalon or asicminer chips, fake pictures, photoshop and so on which you already know and where prepared to argue.

Asicminer, but out of stock. Bfl, but as above. Avalon, have sold chips that are put together by group buyers mostly. Knc, but noone knows if they have a product or when. Maybe I have missed someone, go check bitcointalk.org, everything to know should be there.

As long as customers are fully aware, not being given a 'false impression', I don't believe the potential damage to bitcoins reputation is very great, not when I compare to the potential beneficial effects.
It is not like bitcoin has a pristine reputation, usually it goes like silk road, money launder, ponzi....so sadly even a failure would be more inline with expectations among the masses.

There are risks associated with all new businesses. You want to make preparations to safely start a business? That is a business that will never happen, either because you will never feel safe enough and/or someone else will beat you to it.
Compared to most other bitcoin ipo's I can't see the valuation as very high. The prospectus isn't as bad as you say either, many 'real world' stocks have a lot more holes in theirs.

There is a lot of data showing that terrorist attacks are not expensive at all, there are great savings to make on the escape plans when they are suicidal, a bank robbery is probably more expensive due to the need for escape. Bitcoins would actually be useful because of that but so would Western Union so it doesn't really mean much.

Still not true and won't be in the near future either, there is not enough liquidity in the market to support multiple exchanges at this point - at least not for anyone wanting to buy/sell more than 1000 btc.
@_date: 2013-07-06 01:08:44
More liquidity is needed on the exchange, price doesn't necessarily need to be higher but the order book must have more USD and BTC in it to create more massive slow moving walls.

But then it is back to a trust based system which doesn't work unless you only trade with your close personal friends whos credit rating you can adjust on a daily basis. It doesn't work with anonymous people because a scammer will infiltrate and spend the time necessary to build the trust and then the whole system crashes.

Writing this much without even understanding how the visa and mastercard systems actually works is ridiculous and including outdated information doesn't make it less so.

Those trades are internal and won't show in the blockchain.

True, but common people see money launder as a crime and LR as criminals because they have been arrested, as long as that doesn't change I think the connections are bad for bitcoin. Good PR is to display a different positive profile of things even if essentially the same.

Replace bitcoins in all questions with foreign currency and you can answer them yourself. Really not much difference.

They do, but your question was about diversifying with the least hassle. With those amounts they are a good alternative since there is no need to learn anything about wallets and such. Someone investing millions to invest can also be assumed to be used to having broker accounts.

It is up to financial regulators and institutions to decide how virtual currencies fit into the regulatory framework. That decision will not be based on how you prefer to brand it. Also, strenghten legitimacy of other alt-coins? Like asking Gucci to help a manufacturer of a cheap chinese copy...
@_date: 2013-06-15 01:35:45
But you can have your btc in cold storage, when you want btc at gox you send the key, i.e. give them the wallet.
As for changing the protocol: if not broken - don't fix it. Bitcoin is what it is and risking unforeseen consequences for a minor improvement is not worth it. You won't know what will break until a change is pushed through, if it was easy to foresee you would never need to worry about security in any program and would never need to install security updates.

Gox can't be ignored since it de facto sets the market price and all other exchanges follow. There is nothing indicating that this will change anytime soon.

Much easier to be a TA expert on bitcoin. First you get a graph on usd/btc over time, next choose a point (high or low) and find out what happened right before the point and then find another point where something similar happened.
Example: Today wimbledon tennis is over and the price is going up, find another point on the chart where the price goes up and a tennis tournament has finished, this should be easy because there are tournaments all the time. Now you have your own theory you can tell the world about (present it with a picture also), if it doesn't correlate in the future you can still defend it with different winner, continent, weather or something else.
Good luck to your new career.

You will have plenty of problems getting any useful data from that model. Assuming that everyones equipment instantly switches on/off according to cost is wrong. A lot of people are mining as a hobby, some switching to alt coins, even when they are obvious scams. Some have 'free' electricity. Consider the fact that most people in the world when using a computer are not making money doing so.

If bitcoin is to go mainstream this will solve itself without changing the protocol. A bank will sooner or later allow accounts denominated in btc, following that will visa/mc integrate into their system. With cc in btc those transactions will be kept off the blockchain and merchants worldwide will accept btc without needing to do so actively. I dont really see the network as suitable for small purchases, rather as a b2b platform and a contender to the swift network, also as a store of value  but for mainstream not.

With all grey projects you need to go to several random banks, you might get lucky but more important is that it will allow you to follow up and narrow down the exact details for refusal. When you know that you can tailor your pitch and/or your project for other banks.
