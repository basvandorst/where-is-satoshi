It really depends on how to see the current ecosystem... it's not just about visa and mastercard and their 2%/transaction or whatever. It's about petro-dollars and inflation fueling wars for the last thousand-or-so-years. The ability of someone else to freeze or seize assets because they have guns. It's about freedom. Thus, it's a lot lot better than the current system. Like the quote says, the deflation is just here to win addicts and converts and it protects the decentralization whether people like decentralization or not. The decentralization is the cure. The deflation is the sugar to help it go down.

Are you sure? Because the internet already works without whatever MaidSafe is. So the statement that this new thing is needed to underpin the internet is disprovable without even knowing about this new thing. I can literally say it's bullshit without having to learn anything about this new topic (MaidSafe); because I already know enough about the old topic (the internet).

NP-completeness properties only apply to classical touring machines. That's the point of QC. And there have been demonstrations of QC. This is not a 0.000001% change theory problem. Our public private key system is very explicitly targeted by the kind of QC advancements that have been slowly accumulating. Being dismissive here is not a safe bet. Our money relies on this system being strong. It is worth a debate.

Yea, the thing about gold is you have to actually have enough of it then and there's a lot of dollars out there... much more likely he's just saying things that don't relate to his plans.

You can still put money in a bank if you want. And they could still lend it out if you want. Gov could even still bail them out using taxpayer funds. But... you don't need to put money in banks to have it anymore. You only need a bank if you think they'll generate interest for you. And you don't need that interest as badly because you are not using a non-inflating currency. All in all, interest rates on loans will go up, but when you invest in something you'll actually get a good rate of return. and if you just 'save' you won't find that savings worthless in 50 years because you didn't risk it on investments.

I don't think we should totally spurn r/atheism's approach. If anything, we have a similar problem; a system that's perpetuated by pure belief alone.

Just because it's risky doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. Going out to protest a tyranny is pretty risky; you might get killed. But it may still good ROI because if you can overthrow that tyranny and replace it with a more free society the return is good. For all the reasons we like bitcoin, perhaps it's worth taking larger risks. I think so, and do.

This makes sense. 75% of people have never hear of bitcoin, 80% wouldn't think of using a currency other than the USD. I wouldn't have thought of another currency either before I heard of bitcoin. 
Mostly this tells us that we still have room to grow just in terms of even *telling* people it exists, let alone convincing them to use it. I didn't know that number was 25% before this, for all I knew it was still 3% or it was 70%.

Well, you have to start somewhere. If she's listening. Step 1: Separate those topics. Both are confusing. Better to attack them independently and then decide if there's any relationship. As for bitcoin; watch come youtube on it:  Also recognize that bitcoin is many people's escape from a government controlled currency. Read about the history of central banks. Try "Lords of Finance" and " When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation, and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany". This will begin to put in perspective a rarely discussed conflict about the basis of money. Bitcoin is an effort to win that conflict by one side of it. As for the plan, I'd just wait. I don't think we have enough info yet.

I don't think it's accurate to say bitcoin isn't deflationary. If the bitcoin/fiat exchange rate continues to rise, then people will have an individual incentive to keep bitcoin instead of fiat. Sure, you don't have to. But why keep something that loses value when there's something else that increases value. It makes it into a personal choice. And bitcoin will win the personal choice.
More accurate I think is that it's fine to have a delationary currency. More on that: 
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:14:04
I think there's not justification for why it wouldn't be a 'reserve currency' but can only be an 'trading currency'. She seems to imply that it's because there's not enough Bitcoin. But that reason doesn't make sense; if there were 100T Bitcoin instead of 20M would it really fix this? In reality, what prevents something from being a 'reserve' currency would be something like price instability; either inflation, or unpredictable price. Deflation isn't something that prevents it from being a reserve currency. Deflation actually promotes it as a reserve currency. Therefore, once bitcoin is price stable or deflationary, it will be attractive as a reserve currency. In fact, many 'investors' are essentially using it as a reserve currency now.

I know 'security through obscurity' isn't safe. But let's not underestimate how very, very messy the ledger is. The government can barely figure our mortgage backed securities; they're not skilled at complex systems. And I'm not sure I could identify what accounts where mine if I didn't have a program telling me. Now imagine a world where people are intentionally obscuring things... The problem of solving which physical bodies owns what virtual accounts is going to be an immensley hard problem. I think it would be literally the hardest single problem the government has ever solved. Want to fly to the moon? It's a lot of semi-interdependant systems you can individually test. Want to build a nuke? It's some basic algebra that you use computer models to iterate on. Matching a billion one-time-use accounts with tens of millions of people based on transaction clustering, bank statements, internet traffic logs, and spyware as your only guides is a nightmare of complexity.

Well, I see bitcoin more as being decentralized because you can't have a 'level playing field' with centralization. Centralizing currency control breeds corruption of that currency. Bitcoin is *designed* to fix that. Bitcoin is *designed* specifically to combat centralization. 
And let's just be honest, it'd be a real square-hole/round-peg operation to try and shoe-horn bitcoin into a socialist/communist government. Like, imagine a currency that no one can take away from you but in a world where the government takes/gives to make everyone have equal property? How would the government take things from people when those people are using a currency designed to be un-take-able? Or even prove any of those people own the currency?

This is the first real case of a country seeing bitcoin as a credible threat while their own debt situation devalues their currency. What happens here will be a model for both sides.

I love the way he just randomly throws 'consumerism' in there alongside 'hatred of the vulnerable'. There isn't enough widely-known agreement linking these or backing up the statement that consumerism allows the powerful to do as they please. In short, he should provide some evidence for the claim.
A lot of things Chomsky believes make sense. A lot of them also don't make sense.
(Not that I'm pro 'consumerism'. It seems like a complex topic.)
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:15:35
This depends on what's 'scarce'. As you point out, we stop having post-scarcity when people always want more. Let's say we seize all assets and make sure we can at least feed everyone. Now how do we divvy up the rest? Do we house everyone? Give them an education? What about transportation? What about the quality of those products. Post scarcity is not possible. 
At best we could try to make everyone equal, but experiments with socialism show that corruption and totalitarianism rapidly invades any system designed to force equality. Furthermore, forced equality correlates strongly with ever declining resources. In some cases it's cased the death of tens of millions by failures of central planning; the great leap forward in China or the Holomodor famine in Ukraine. That's not a proof of course that consumerism and inequality is good, just that we'll need something other than force of violence/government to solve the problem
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:34:32
Bitcoin's current implementation will weaken governments because it limits the value of using force. If makes it harder to use force to tax. Also, they can no longer fund a use of force by printing money (which is very common when going to war in particular). Government is the ligitmized use of force; the moral approval to use violence on a peaceful person in order to get them to obey. So if bitcoin makes force less useful, then it makes government weaker.
I also like the idea of being able to get transparency in the government. But like others I feel they already have the ability to do this if they wanted. They don't want to.

Firstly, I appreciate having a civil and sense-making conversation here. I don't want to go so far as to say that's rare, but perhaps more like I appreciate someone who can talk through the nuances of a situation. Even the people I agree with at any given moment can sometimes be a bit close minded.
I have two difficulties with the plan to move to a socialist state on the path to getting to that charity-based-equality that we both agree is probably ideal. 
1. How do we create a strong government that is benevolent/non-corrupt? It seems like the least corrupt institutions we have are run not by elected officials but by their creators. E.g. Jimmy Whales and wikipedia. That's not a democracy, it's a monarchy that people can walk away from at any moment if they don't like it. By contrast, it seems like every organization that lasts a long time is eventually corrupted as people usurp it's organization. The libertarians will say the answer is to reduce the involvement of government so it can't be corrupt. I find that compelling because I can find no other way to make an honest organization than to let people walk away from it when it stops being so.
2. I'm not convinced people will be able to make the transition from being compelled to give in a socialist world to voluntary giving in an anarchist world. They would have to be educated and 100% bought in. But while that work is happening, it's once again just as possible that some corrupt elements will usurp the organization. Here again, I suspect the only way to keep a revolution clean is to allow people to walk away from that organization and follow/start another at any moment.
Thanks for your time

This is so true. The point is you can control your wallet if you want to and do what you want with your money.
Also, don't hate coinbase for it. They're under restrictions and scrutiny because they plug into the fiat system. They have to play by those rules; which including enforcing victim-less crime laws like gambling restrictions.

There's still a lot of fluctuation in the price because the world doesn't have a good handle on what the price *should* be. For example, the price-to-earnings ratios of stocks.

I wouldn't say this is so much as a worry as part of the design of bitcoin. There's no way to prove anyone did anything as long as there's some other random address in between. This is just a growing period for companies and others to learn this inevitability of uncertainty and deniability.

100% agree. The point is to have a system that's not *forced* on us. We still want a system, we just want to choose it. 
Bitcoin itself is a system with very clear rules. We agree to those rules by our choice. But we do get the benefit of those rules.

Fully agree. A lot of people on this comment list talk about how the blockchain is totally open. While technically true, it's also heavily anonomized. When used correctly, a given person has an unknown number of unknown addresses. Even when you get a good *sense* of where a person's money has gone it's very difficult to prove they actually control that money. Even if you do convince a jury or judge of this, what happens when they deny owning it? How do you seize it? A person's argument that they don't own those coins is entirely consistent with not giving up the keys to them. They hide a USB key under a rock and that becomes a very tough nut to crack.
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:33:55
Actually the concept of monarchy and government in general is about the ability to enact laws that are enforced by violence. This is how they contrast to other big organizations like the Red Cross. The Red Cross can make all the rules they want but people can opt out. When the government makes rules, people can't opt out. Bitcoin is more like the Red Cross; you don't have to use it. There are many competing alt coins and it's easy to start a new one if one doesn't fit your needs. But that said, no one is compelled to do it your way either.

Yep. Price swings are the norm.
Also worth noting bitcoin is kind of all or nothing. Either A: it's a well used currency (and thus we get all the benefits of it) or B: it's not and we don't get the benefits. Right now, we're close to category A than ever. Until it becomes A, the price swings are part of the package. 
Now, the place to worry is if we start regressing from adoption. Like if business roll back their user because customers don't come. I have no idea what level of rollback represents a problem. I guess for me the only impacting rollback would be if gyft stopped taking bitcoin or my friends stopped accepting it as a form of peer to peer payment. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:10:50
This is true only as long as fiat currency is involved. I guess everyone could continue using the hybrid model many of us do now.

If they're willing to invest millions of their own money making bitcoin secure, then they deserve to have more influence than I who did not spend those millions. That is the implicit contract with the miners. It's not about how many people you are strong (democracy of people). It's about how many machines you are strong (democracy of machines). Also, though I expect it won't stay that way, it so happens that good mining hardware still isn't that hard to get. 28nm is still the standard and you can buy that for a reasonable price. Most mining is still a problem of electricity prices.

You should use bitcoin because there's people out there who want to use the complexity of the normal financial system to take that money away from you. While the world is far less violent than it used to be it is still quite dangerous. Finance and money is where people battle now. What makes bitcoin nice here is that it's very clear. Maybe people won't value bitcoins, that's hard to predict. But if they do, the way it works is far simpler and easier to understand than any other financial system you'll encounter; you know how much bitcoin is, you know how to move bitcoin, you know where bitcoin is stored, you know what happens when you over-draw your bitcoin, etc. And those rules don't change out from under you. Using bitcoin is a way to sidestep many of the traps designed into the current system of finance. By contrast, dive into inflation, banking, etc. and you'll find a maze of systems designed to take your money. Just one small example; in "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" John Keynes says that inflation increases employment because people don't realize when their wages go down. Did you know that most people in our world follow Keynesian economics? Do you know how to protect yourself against that design? You shouldn't have to dive into such rabbit holes. By learning to use bitcoin you won't have to learn much to be reasonably safe. By contrast, using banks and dollar, you have to learn an awful lot to get to the bottom and you'll never be truly safe.

Market cap of BTC could be greater than market cap of gold simply because it moves faster (send over the internet) and divides easier (don't need to re-melt). Not saying it will happen (gold has a long track record and many features) or when, but there are features BTC has that gold doesn't.

It won't work then. But that's a different kind of event. 
A massive power outage lasting months and years could happen (e.g. EMP, CME) but is unlikely. There have been some rare events that might have caused big power outages but they've never happened during the era in which we used power so much. In this scenario, BTC is worthless. 
However, a currency devaluation will happen eventually. Every fiat currency does it. Pick any one in history and try to trace out a two hundred year span in which it wasn't devalued by &gt;95%. It's never happened for a non-metal-backed currency. BTC is a solution not to an apocalypse in which we lose everything. It's a solution to the inevitable collapse of something we use a lot.

This is a pretty fundamental point for bitcoin; it was made deflationary on purpose. It/we stand specifically against keynesian economics and the belief that inflation fuels employment by causing people to work for less wages (it's spelled out in the first few pages of "The general theory of employment, interest and money". In our opinion we do earn more dollars, but not because inflation caused the economy to grow. If you believe that, you should probably be an enemy of bitcoin because we're going to break that system.

Faking a chat log isn't some complex 'digital forensics'. We're talking about corruption. Cops cover up murder of people they arrest on a regular (at least yearly if not weekly) basis. And the cops here were so corrupt even other cops went after them. Is it so hard to imagine they might fake evidence? So hard to imagine corruption when there's so much corruption around you? When we're all here literally trying to invent a new currency because ours is printed and given only to bankers or spent on wars by the trillions while the country rots? In this context, you're telling me a person would have to be a conspiracy theorist to believe some cops would fake a chat log to smear a drug dealer that made them look like fools for year? Yea, it's not outside the bounds of consideration.

It's a great clarification of their vision and why they have problems. They get too much hate here from people who seem to have a problem downloading and using a self-controlled wallet (it feels like work when your inflation is at 1% but it feels like a welcome workaround for people whose inflation is at &gt;20% with capital controls).

Good points to both of you.

I was wondering the same thing, so I read a good chunk of "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and I think their world was a bit simpler; they did just fine conquering a lot of territory and imposing a slightly more productive culture but then withered away from internal corruption (e.g. not necessarily fighting wars but military coup after military coup).
I've been trying to find good examples of where the US is and they're a lot more recent (e.g. somewhere in South America like every decade). It seems like the key is if the US can do one or two years of massive debasement of the currency but then immediately balance it's budget in the process, then you come out ok. If you run a deficit while debasing, that's when you're fucked. So when the moment of crisis comes, we gotta throw everything in to balancing the budget the year of a major debasement. If we can do that, we can stave off collapse.

Very interesting. On the one hand, with regular dev work the customer is king. On the other hand, it's pretty clear that someone needs to care in order for a currency to not screw over it's users. And if that currency is decentralized then the users have to do it. Clearly some people can get away with not caring, but a lot need to care. And the people who don't care risk getting screwed just like people today who don't care about the money system are getting screwed. The killer app isn't the app on your phone; it's a system you *can* understand and thus a system you can be assured isn't designed to screw you. Perhaps in this case, the idea that most people can get away with not having to care isn't true. Perhaps with respect to money, our representation for the value of our objects and the thing we use to trade everything (including our own lifespan) we need to care about how it works.

Worth looking into actually buying a TIP. You have to pay taxes on the inflation value-gain before the security reaches maturity. In direct terms; if there is inflation you owe money before the TIP pays out. It's a terrible system. Not a realistic hedge against inflation.

I don't think we can claim that 'growth' has a knowable limit. Two examples:
1. The amount of physical resources in your phone (atoms, space, energy) is very small. It will take us a long time to turn all the matter on Earth's crust into things as useful as your phone. And we'll likely have invented even more useful patterns to put that matter in by then anyways.
2. We live in a very large universe and Earth is not our limit any more than our valley or our continent was our limit in times past. It takes a lot to build a trans-Atlantic ship when you're in the stone age. And it takes a lot to build a trans-solar ship when you're in our age. But it can get done with the resources we have on Earth no problem; so it's only a matter of time until we actually get around to doing it (assuming we don't get wiped out). That will greatly increase the amount of space and resources we play with.
In short, there's plenty more room to grow.

Interesting question. If there's an island of power, bitcoin will keep working there. If there's island*s*, bitcoin will offer consistency and availability in the even of a partition and then resolve by block-chain length when the partition is fixed (probably to great conflict and likely a hard-fork if the partition went on for very long). Obviously dark areas will be without service and fall back to physical offerings. It's easy to imagine perform at least some bitcoin transactions though through satelite broadcast of the block-chain and HF radio to reach people with a solid enough internet connection to be running full nodes. So I imagine even in dark areas people would know what they own and could move money when it was large enough to be worth doing so.

@_date: 2018-07-30 17:38:58
Disagree with you both. 
The Bitcoin is very clearly and interestingly deflationary. The concepts of inflation, deflation, and 'backing' are all quite in this realm. This McDonnald's coin is a currency issued by a private party who is backing that currency. It's not like that company is trying to make a currency, but they might have done so on accident just like gift cards are used as a form of currency in some countries with weak government-issued money. 
Happy to also make a case for wanting money that's anti-inflation, which is sort of the basis of wanting money backed by something that can't just be hand-waved to existence (either special gold atoms which are hard to forge or burgers which take energy). 
Sure, it's a little silly. But it's very much on topic and interesting. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 19:07:00
Yea, this 'stolen card' thing doesn't apply here. We don't need an identity because the money doesn't need an identity to be considered real money. It's like buying with cash, but online.

It would be false to assume that everyone believes the Keynesian model or derivatives of it is best for humanity. I agree that humans can in theory control inflation/deflation to make a stronger overall economy. I also agree that in periods of high-unemployment that government spending and specifically inflation will cause people to work for a lower real wage; driving employment back up and getting total production above what it would have been (this as the cause of inflation stimulating the economy is made very clear in the General Theory of Employment Interest and Money)....
But that doesn't mean it's best overall in the long term. Eventually, people abuse the power to control money and major problems result that might be larger than all the minor good they produced with such tight control. Similarly, convincing people to work for a lower real wage might be causing long-term problems we don't expect. And again sometimes we abuse this idea and the cost of a sovereign debt crisis might be worse than all the minor gains we got along the way. 
Most importantly, regardless of whether inflation and/or controlled money supply is 'good' or 'bad' (it's a tough call), Bitcoin has a very clear opinion; Bitcoin is deflationary. The money supply is limited in the long run. When anyone loses a coin or the world GDP grows, Bitcoin is going to deflate. That is a goal (section 6 of the bitcoin whitepaper talks to incentives that work 'completely inflation free'). That is part of the addictive adoption strategy (good money pushing out bad). That is deeply embedded in the code and expectation. Bitcoin is going to drag us all into a deflationary world by eliminating competing inflationary assets. I hope it is a good place, because we're going; Keynesian economists, Austrian economists, anarchists, socialists, and all.

Just to be clear, HFT's frontRunning isn't just another bot. It's a specific strategy used to arbitrage when a large buyer or seller enters the market. It is a pretty market unfriendly practice... but it's also based on government rules requiring best price and dark pools in the exchanges and special bidding practices to help front run.. and oddly even bitcoin exchanges aren't that corrupt as far as anyone can tell :P

I think what you're asking is a question about whether printing (or seizing so you can print) more money is an effective way to stop recessions. 
While I think we can conclusively say it does get people back to work, there are less easy to measure negative consequences (like the mis-allocation of capital or the moral injustice of theft).
As someone who supports a strongly deflationary currency like bitcoin, I subscribe to the notion that the juice of inflation isn't worth the squeeze.

1. No one 'knows' what will 'save' an economy. They might have an opinion or theory but they don't know.
2. No one has a right to just take things from you. Even if there's a lot of them. If my whole neighborhood decided to come clean out my house it doesn't make them right. It makes them numerous and hard to stop. But it doesn't make them right. 
3. If they ban bitcoin, they won't be 'right' and the price won't be 'zero'. At some point bitcoin as a deflationary currency is going to start really breaking Keynesian economics. It's going to get messy. They will ban it. They will try to take it. They will try to use violence on people who use it. Bitcoin was designed to be resistant to these measures. You have the right to sell yours. But don't expect everyone to sell. And don't expect it to work. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:37:06
It is my opinion, some parts better founded than others. What part would you want more detail on? (So I can be more specific where it counts). 
E.g. Well-founded: "Bitcoin is deflationary on purpose". Anyone designing a currency would understand inflation and deflation. Changing between one and the other in BTC is almost trivial. It was coded to be deflationary. Thus, it was done on purpose. Several other conclusions can be made from this one (e.g. that deflation is part of it's adoption scheme). 
Less well founded: That it will end war-mongering. Realistically, wars are almost never fought with money gotten voluntarily. Inflation is rampant in wars. So is seizing property of all kinds. If the only way to start a war was to personally pay your own hard earned money for one; I think we'd see a lot less of them. Imagine if you as a dictator had to convince people to pay your bitcoin address to fund a war. Like you literally couldn't go to people's homes and take money. Yea, you can take like chairs and beds and milling machines and make people do work for you under compulsion. But you still can't buy anything. You can't leverage the amazing abilities of a modern industrial economy to make war material, you have to build that pipeline of product. Could you still find a way to make a big war? Probably. Will there still be wars? Probably. But it'd be sure hard to start and run another WWI for example. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 20:59:32
So the argument is that not enough places take it? Because while I'll admit it'd be nice if more places did, I don't feel like my bitcoin are illiquid; enough places around the internet do take it that I have no problem getting goods. Worst case I trade it for a gift card and use that. (It being high or low volatility seems less important when I'm keeping it one way or another) 
@_date: 2015-11-11 05:33:50
Would stability be nice? Yes. 
Are we dealing with a never-before-seen, digital, distributed, crowd supported currency? Yes.
Just the fact that it still has value and is traded is actually enough to make it a functioning currency. I buy stuff with it. I save part of my money in it. We already live the dream. What other people think doesn't matter; our little multi-billion dollar community uses it as a currency. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:37:14

The difference between 'savings' and 'speculative vehicle' is really just whether we intend to convert it back into dollars or whether we intend to convert it into products. I can't speak for other but I'm never going back to dollars with that money. If it hits $10 I'll keep it, if it hits $10,000 I'll keep it. I'll keep it until I want to buy something with it. I think that makes it 'savings' rather than 'speculative vehicle' but I'm open to counter argument since I haven't thought deeply about the difference before.

Just putting it on that screen is a lie. Bitcoin buys drugs. It's used for cyber crimes. It's probably used for child porn. But there's no evidence that ISIS uses bitcoin. There's a difference between 'they could use it' and 'they do use it'. The difference is honest journalism.

I sometimes wonder how many people on here still understand what bitcoin does, what inevitable consequences it's adoption has (assuming it works as intended, not hacked, not changed, etc.). It is so easy to miss this in all the technical complexity to make it happen and daily market changes. Just seeing the way people react to Eth (which has rolled back transactions and has build in inflation), implies they don't really understand bitcoin; they just understand blockchain. But blockchain isn't market-addictive. Bitcoin is. At least a few still see that design and where it leads...

It might not be obvious, but this system is deflationary on purpose; it's an economic system that not everyone likes. It also happens to be give big incentives; low-inflation currencies out compete high inflation currencies. When the price goes up relative to other currencies, that's BTC delivering on it's design. When BTC goes big, there will be a massive deflationary spike. But it will also be the end of the oligarchy what controls the banks and money supply today; making people poor with stagnant wages while building a massive debt bubble. It will be an end to massive paramilitaries funded by war-mongering governments. It will be a return to free markets and free people. Assuming it works as designed, that is. And who really knows if it will work. We just know that's the design and a bit about the processes and strategies to get there. I'm no even so certain I'm going to like where this goes myself. Big change like this is a big risk. We'll see.

It is difficult to argue about whether deflation is good or bad. But nothing short of a code change to the protocol will make bitcoin inflationary. And even if someone builds a bank that does fractional reserve lending, they can't keep expanding the money supply unless they constantly reduce the fraction held in reserve. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. No doubt about it and no way around it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:04:59
No. Not at all. BTC is a very different product than ETH. For example, a really clear inflation scheme. BTC isn't wonderful because it solves all your problems. It's really wonderful because it defeats a massive problem: fiat. ETH isn't designed to do that and it won't do that. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:19:25

The number of exchanges that aren't regulated (because they're just random people) is enormous. Those people are only going to get more numerous and some will be more technically advanced so they can scale. There will never be regulation of the exchanges. It's simply impossible to control them all, especially when much of it is done with cash. Also, again, who needs exchanges when all the transactions are in bitcoin?
