In all likelihood, the competitor will be following a similar idea because many markets are a race to the bottom to provide the most bare minimum product at the lowest price.


I can think of numerous things I prefer to buy for life. Shoes, chairs, my bed, virtually anything in my kitchen, just to name a few things. Hell, is all about people who want the same thing, and it has 168,000 subscribers.


I would argue both of these are at least partially wrong. Higher quality might increase the price initially, but the lower longterm cost of ownership typically results in savings over the life of the product. Additionally, well-crafted products tend to have a strong second-hand market which further brings down the price to purchase. The notion of cheap goods saving you money is often not true. Finally, keep in mind there is a difference between luxury and quality. Luxury often results in high prices, but quality is not necessarily proportional to price.

There is a difference between things being improved upon and things becoming obsolete by design. Planned obsolescence is an industrial design idea that has been around for ~100 years and encourages the production of low-quality goods that will wear out over time in order to force the consumer to buy the same thing again in the future. Some businesses don't view at as a good thing when you can use their product forever without ever needing to buy from them again. How many times have you had an otherwise good product break because of a single design flaw where there company used cheap materials in a single spot, resulting in a complete failure of the item?

Those were the days...
I would have bought my first Bitcoin right at the bottom of the crash discussed in the linked thread if it wasn't so complicated to get your hands on them back then. I lived in a rural area (no local hodlrs at that time), and I didn't have much money to spare so I wasn't willing to risk the services that accepted money orders. All I wanted was for a way to put $10-$20 from each paycheck into btc.
I finally managed to buy my first 0.5 btc on ebay literally hours before the next bubble popped, and I paid well over the highs hit on the exchanges. It was disheartening to see my meager investment dropping so much in those days, but its quadrupled in value since, so it seems to have worked out :-)

A better strategy is to disrupt the lesser civilizations power structure and slowly replace it with clones controlled by the advanced civ.

USD stored at Coinbase are FDIC insured, the Bitcoin stored there are covered under a separate insurance policy.

Anyone that says they have an idea of this is blowing hot air, no one really knows because the very nature of Bitcoin is experimental and we have little to no point of reference for how this experiment will turn out. After the last bubble, we knew it settled once it had spent a year hovering around $250.
Don't try to time the market, time in the market is always better than timing the market. If you think BTC is a good investment, buy it and hold.

I originally subscribed to this subreddit because I wanted to keep informed on something I'm deeply fascinated by and have significant money invested in. As the moderators have stepped in with censorship more and more, I've realized it serves my primary need less and less. All of this side topics that have been banned are still highly important to Bitcoin and have relevance to its value and success in the future. I want to learn more about the developments around all of these topics, but sadly this subreddit doesn't fill that gap.
I still check this place on occasion (that's how I ended up here now), and I'm usually disappointed in the content I see posted. The mods have every right to control this subreddit as they see fit, but they are pushing people like me to other resources that are better for gathering important information.
With that said, do you have recommendations for places to keep informed on this stuff?
@_date: 2015-09-15 14:26:19
You rock! I'm taking the advice of the mods and moving to other places to get more valuable information. Thanks for putting this together.

Not to mention that a currency that is universal and can be sent anywhere in the world nearly instantly certainly has some level of value. No other currency can accomplish this as gracefully as Bitcoin.

I bought my first bitcoin at $300 USD perfectly timed with the peak of the last bubble at $230. That's right, I paid more than the last bubble and I was the guy holding the bag when it dropped. I knew it would be worth it in the long run, and today I have more than doubled my investment. BTC could still lose half its current value and I would just about break even.
The volatility in this market is a given, learn to ignore it and plan for when it reaches $10K by this time next year.
Edit: I want to add that I also spent my first BTC that day too.

For 50% of your share of the bitcoins, I'll send you a link to a youtube video that explains how to find videos on youtube.

Most of the payment service for bitcoin allow sellers to immediately received USD when a buyer uses bitcoin, thus avoiding the changes in value to BTC.

This is awesome! I got to use a CNC mill for the first time as part of a class project this semester. I wish I had come up with this idea then.

I think this hits the nail. Cryptocurrencies have the ability to be custom tailored for specific purposes. I think bitcoin is likely going to serve as the benchmark for all others, and we will have a diverse selection of Cryptocurrencies to use.

coinbase.com allows you to spend as little as $0.10 USD on bitcoins.

I think [this]( is another adoption curve to take into consideration. IMO, we are just crossing the adoption gap right now as we transition from early adopters that are visionaries to early adopters that are pragmatic about the use of new technology.
This current push upwards seems to be driving the interest of bigger organizations (e.g. paypal, ebay, hedge funds, etc.). Once more established companies start entering the fray we will witness the transition to the mainstream. I think once we have an established escrow service bring their services to Bitcoin, a lot of people are going to start getting involved.

mBTC are all the rage these days, I hear they just surpassed $1.00

If you are interested in buying in, I would recommend setting aside a small amount of money on a regular basis and using that to buy Bitcoins. Put an amount of money into it that you wouldn't miss if you lost it and see how the market moves.
Nobody knows for sure what Bitcoin is going to do tomorrow much less over the next few years. In my opinion, the potential to move to the upside greatly outweighs the downside risks.
If you buy in now, you would still be one of the early adopters. Bitcoin has barely even hit the radar of the mainstream, and if it does, that will be when it becomes truly explosive.
