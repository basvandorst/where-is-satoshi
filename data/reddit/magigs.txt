Buy more on the dip if you can
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:44:17
Exactly

And in regards to that. There is acknowledgment regardless of whether it comes from a place of codependency. The very things that make it what it is, are also gate ways towards exploiting it. A currency of value permits wealthy people to amass bitcoin. I’m sure you know but people are saying that this downturn is the result of a sell off, possibly those multiple Mt. Gox accounts all dumping... its part of the game.  It’s fucked and this is sometimes why people think regulation could lead to less pump and dumping, price manipulation, etc etc. You can’t have an isolated monetary system survive in a global network. There’s a lot of risk.

Serious question regarding this. I’m in the US. Wouldn’t you owe taxes on both the sale and purchase of that transaction? I heard you get taxed basically every time you move the coins.

Technically, if you’re a “real bitcoiner” you want to be spending your BTC in order to give it more legitimacy and relevance. All in moderation of course. But in order for it to survive as a currency and not a security, it’s gotta be used to buy shit, and be exchangeable for goods, quickly, easily, and affordably.

That’s awesome. An example that you can do both. It’s smart to diversify, its smart to have security, but it also helps to support the system by using it. It promotes wider adoption, and a rising tide raises all lambos.

Pretty much all crypto, along with any stock, is susceptible to a “pump and dump” scheme. Actually amongst a lot of shitcoins that’s is a major problem. There was a segment on John Oliver about it.  BTC isn’t regulated (in a manner of speaking) so there aren’t really any rules in place regarding protecting investors. In NYSE, you get caught doing pump and dumps, and you can owe hefty fines and possibly even jail time (but only if you screw over rich people ��)

That was my thought too. I always think of the pizza guy. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:50:18
You need to have disposable income to buy bitcoin, or purchase gear to mine it. Rather way, millennials don’t have much of that disposable income stuff.

Eh, I’m still up, so I can’t go into panic mode just yet.

Same! Let the revolution begin! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:25:05
Yes it is, but to a certain extent I understand why. Most of them are in place to combat money laundering and to attempt to create a "digital paper trail" in the event you are a scumbag who finances terrorism or are trying to hide drug money, etc etc. eventually we will face regulations and the info will be used for tax info , capital gains, or something of a similar "raping and pillaging" nature.

There’s a big difference between a small shop taking a few American dollars VS multi billion dollar per year exchanges for things like Oil. 
“Since the agreements of 1971 and 1973, OPEC oil is generally quoted in US dollars, sometimes referred to as petrodollars.” 
That means if you want oil and all you have is Yen, gold, rubles, etc. you HAVE to convert your currency into USD. That when talking about the scale of monetary funds being moved around per year... helps keep the USD afloat, stable, etc. 
there has been pushback for years regarding this, Venezuela was involved in “petro” which is an oil backed (alledgedly) crypto... 
This is appears to be a power move by Russia to try to weaken the strength of the dollar. But I didn’t even read it yet so that’s only speculation.
Edit: I was partially wrong, it’s a preemptive move regarding possible sanctions.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:37:08
Shouldn’t this be a great example of the price normalizing?

This is one of my favorite memories from the show. It's how I feel to this day, I would respond to winning the lottery.

@_date: 2017-11-26 22:22:22
My condolences. What are you looking for? Long term? Short term. One suggestion right off the bat would be diversification. Definitely want to read up on the subject a bit. With any type of investment there is always an inherent risk. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:46:07
Isn’t there a ton of additional fees to use BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:05:40
But doesn’t it’s very existence stand as a representation of anti regulation, big govt, etc.? And as I’m writing I see that that is in fact what creates this relationship and now I get it. “Indirectly” is the key.  This is the definition of “revolutionary technology” Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:56:10
Then that’s a good basis when you consider were still in the “early adoption” phase 
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:55:19
Can you expand on this? I want to know more
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:55:59
Agreed

Actually the fastest growing gamer demographic is older women. Gaming apps are taking over by storm. When you have in game currencies, it’s an intro to conceptualizing a digital currency, so it’s basically training wheels on a trike, so you can’t expect them to understand how to fly a Crypto rocket to the moon over night, but it’s a start. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 06:59:55
This was exactly my point. It’s training wheels 
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:57:02
They will, it’s called adulting 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:58:24
In all honesty... I want to pay off my loans, get a reasonable used car. If it shoots to the moon, I want property, and a nest egg and to travel and no longer work in the service industry.

I was wondering why there was a rally. I was at work and couldn't catch much on the hearing. Great stuff, hopefully this is the balance we've been seeking. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:23:55
It's not exactly a "get rich quick" if you plan on "hodl"-big it for 5+ years. And I'm sure from your comment you've done extensive background research into the topic... 
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:53:09
I remember hearing about that when it happened thinking, man I should check this Bitcoin thing out. If I had then, I would have had the same curiosity I had when it was 2K+ and I actually would have A. Been able to afford a few, and B. Definitely bought some with my meager (college kid living in NYC) income. and C. Totally forgotten about it until it was at 2K...

I don't know, I think it's proved it's value in the 4-4500 mark, BTC among a lot of people represents a crypto that is more of a "security" investment, similar to that of gold with a higher ceiling because, well there's less BTC than there is gold... so to speak... That is why we saw pushback around the 4500 mark today and it already recovered from there to the 4700 range. It's higher highs and higher lows, at least until there is a major sell, an economic collapse in a major market (which could either force people to sell off BTC for immediate financial help, or it could send its value SKYROCKETING, it could technically do both)

Now or soon. Watch the fluctuations, your technically buying in a bear market, the trick is figuring out when to maximize your profit. I just watched It drop and drop, and then I looked at it 10 min ago and it's up 125$ in the last hour, now it can fluctuate hundreds even near thousands of dollars in a day so this could just be a brief upswing. If I had the money I'd be buying small increments now. 
Edit: a word.

Agreed. If we really want it to touch the sky. We need anybody and everybody to adopt it and use it. AKA: Tourists are good for business.

Haha, I have been a downer lately, It’s not that I’m not happy I haven’t been keeping up on news and such. I injured myself and have been out of commission for a few weeks. I wanted to see if the sun had the skinny. I’m gonna check this out. No tax!!??
