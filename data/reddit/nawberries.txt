If you got this far down and are still asking you are wasting time. He hasn't actually answered anyone except repeating his Big Old Meany Mr. 25% and lose faith in currency lines.

This is the first time in my admittedly small amount of time researching bitcoins that I have seen a logarithmic chart. Really changes the way you think about it.

Sometimes the tip bot is pretty slow. Also I couldn't really figure out how to do anything with my tip until I used the export account command. It sets up a new working wallet on blockchain.info so you can go from there.

I don't think its changing much. Tips beyond a few bitcents are pretty rare and occasionally users will go on tipping sprees. Only saw a single 1BTC tip earlier today and it seemed like a pretty big deal.

I think a neat site would be like couchsurfing for bitcoins. Like hey if you are visiting blank city and need a place to stay, I have a couch for x amount.

Sorry, don't know enought about the bot to asnwer that one for you. Hope you get it figured out.

Haven't seen that one yet. There are almost too many different sites to keep track of. What would you reccomend as the most important ones?
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:44:16
Says its just me as well.

Why is this? You have to personally tip the bot to make tips show up, or a subs mod has to tip to get the bot to show up?
