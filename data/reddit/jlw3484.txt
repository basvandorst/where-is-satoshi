Would a Samurai wallet work just as well. It's paper. Also, could sending the coins from my phone from my paper wallet be traced back to me?

Yeah me too. I don't buy btc, I receive referral coin from  Crypto Gambling sites, so it won't hurt me to hold
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:18:17
I use my referral coin to buy gift cards to Amazon or to pay my phone bill.

It depends on who gambles and how much. You have to get quantity referrals to make anything. It's definitely nothing to make a living from though. Now the Darknet Markets referral programs are a little bit different;)

They probably used a tumbler which makes it virtually impossible to trace.

I've been around bitcoin for five years and I only seem to recall fees being high when the price is soaring or falling dramatically.

True. Libertarians must be completely for it based off the "sovereign money" argument".

Good answer. That's a very objective viewpoint.

I haven't seen them really talk about it. I think they are afraid to bring it forward into the public conscience.

I have heard that there are systems you can use that will greatly increase your odds of making some real coin, but was wondering if anybody has a personal experience they would like to share about. Thanks.

I like Trump, but respect your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:40:36
Good answer. I think conservatives just have more traditional values is all. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:38:27
Lol. Or put a tariff on it. :P

I haven't had a problem until now. I have to use bitpay to buy my gift cards because the sites won't allow me to send from most wallets because of the new payment protocols unfortunately.

@_date: 2018-04-12 20:18:33
Yes! Problem has been resolved. Thanks!

I have to use it to buy gift cards from egifter and gyft unfortunately. Their payment protocols don't allow payments from personal wallets.

Thank god! I had 77 in my wallet, plus a 26 dollar payment that I sent this morning that has vanished without a trace. So you're saying funds will be restored? Do you have an eta? Thanks for responding. I've been using Bitpay for almost 2 years now.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:20:56
That's f×÷=ed!

Yeah I like my Samouri wallet, but can't pay certain invoices with it except through Bitpay. Thanks for the useful info.
