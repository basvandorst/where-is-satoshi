Hey.  I applied a couple weeks ago, but haven't heard anything back.
This might not be the best place to campaign on my behalf, but I've written some small time bitcoin projects ([Geminipy]( and [Fulmo]( and would really love an opportunity to be involved with this residency.

Awesome.  Thanks for the response!
@_date: 2016-03-11 22:26:27
Awesome. Looking forward to it.
By the way, for other developers in here.  I wrote a Gemini python library to make it super easy to write software that executes trades through the Gemini API.

Very cool.  I never thought I'd randomly run into an esperanto fan on I only learned about it from Monero.

Yea, I now realized that was bone-headed of me to forget.  I'll upload a few tonight.

From my understanding, nodejs is server side Javascript. I chose python for the server side language because there was already a Lightning RPC library written in python.
I've never used nodejs before, but was familiar with Flask and jquery, which is what I ended up choosing.
Next time I'll take a look at nodejs though. Thanks.

I've been working on this project for a few weeks, and I wanted to introduce it to the community.
For those already running a [c-lightning node]( this is a simple way to slap on a web based frontend.
It supports all major functionality including opening/closing Lightning channels, creating and paying Lightning invoices, and even has a built in internal Bitcoin wallet (which supports Bech32).
I'm not a front-end developer, so the html/css is very basic.  But all the basic Lightning Network functionality is under the hood.
If you're a CSS guru and want to help with the style, submit a pull request!

Thanks.  I actually do too.  Although the reason it looks so basic is because I'm no artist, and I don't know CSS that well.
I just enjoyed working with the Lightning RPC python library and learning how Lightning worked under the covers.


I'll add it to my to-do list.

Haha, yup  How'd you figure out it was esperanto?

I use javascript to hide and show specific elements of the UI as needed.  That screenshot looks like it just loaded the raw HTML without any of the javascript.
