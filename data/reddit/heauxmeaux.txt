Haha. Before today I'd never spent more than a couple mins on this sub. Reading the comments on this post sincerely defending this company has critically overloaded my irony detector.

The point is that they could easily say you have xx BTC but it's in cold storage so please contact us. But they don't. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:13:04
Again, why do they show a ZERO BALANCE if they aren't being shady? It's not like they don't already have a reputation for being shady. It doesn't matter what they promise. There is an expected level of communication necessary for a ONLINE FINANCIAL business to maintain reputability. People are free to call out their bullshit as they see fit.

Some of us care more about the principle of the matter. If you think stealing is acceptable because it's not more than some x amount then you're both wrong and a bad person. This is not directed at you necessarily but this sentiment seems common here. How do you expect crypto to take off if people who don't spend 16 hours a day online can't safely use it?
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:15:41
They *said* they would give it back when they were caught stealing. Otherwise their website would tell the user that their coins are in storage. There's nothing even in their FAQ about it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:37:09
That would be a valid point if they actually indicated that's what they do. There is no indication on their site of a 'cold storage' process. Shouldn't the account say you have xx BTC remaining in cold storage oh and by the way please verify your identity? They instead show ZERO BALANCE because they actually just took it hoping you don't notice. Even assuming good faith you basically have to figure out and threateningly present evidence to them in a manual email which is so far technologically backwards that it's mindblowing. Running a secure site is hard but not impossible with proper procedures. I've never had my normal online bank/brokerage accounts compromised and they've been around for a decade.

Nice words, but that still doesn't tell me how one would exchange cryptocurrencies and other currencies at a fair price without trust in a market maker. Please link to a solution that allows fluid exchange while retaining full cryptographic control.

Yea. I purchase tangible goods and services which requires tender that other people accept. I also enjoy the fact that my savings and investment accounts remain secure for years on end without incident and are insured in the unlikely event that something does happen. LOL

Lack of accountability on these exchanges' parts is why cryptocurrency will never take off in its current form. Why shouldn't one be able to leave money in there. A responsible business has strategies in place to mitigate and cover losses due to hacks. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:29:01
It sounds like they could have provided literally any form of indication that the coins were 'moved' to 'cold storage' but chose instead to just take it and force the user to actually notice and waste time digging through evidence and have to contact a human using a form to get them back. Ethical issues aside, what part of this process is modern? This is the complete opposite of technological transparency and defending this practice is stupid as fuck if you want cryptocurrencies to succeed. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 13:52:29
Yea, it is actually. It would be a basic courtesy to email you and say by the way we're moving these to storage. In fact the process could and should be fully automated which is trivial. I thought the entire point of Bitcoin was technological transparency for financial transactions? This is the dark ages. It's like going on vacation and coming back to find all the shit in your apartment gone with no explanation because the landlord moved it all into his personal storage for 'safety'. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:08:40
It means they're stealing and getting away with it for people who don't ask for their money back. Otherwise they wouldn't show ZERO BALANCE and would have email notifications sent out when they move your coins to cold storage. It is trivial to set up these notifications. I get a text on my phone instantly if I use my credit card in another state suddenly at an unusual store for me and this is a GOOD THING. You'd think a technologically advanced currency infrastructure could keep up with best practices from 10 years ago.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:27:25
There's no way you're real. It's not possible for someone to be so naive. Such an inability to understand basic economics implies you lack the critical thinking ability to pour a bowl of cereal. I feel bad for you honestly.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:36:37
Yea, stick with normal money in regulated financial institutions. It's no wonder that every single one of these services that requires your trust has shady shit go down when there are no criminal consequences. The technological solution for exchanging cryptocurrency would be some kind of completely distributed solution but there isn't a viable one (yet?), and that still doesn't solve the problem of exchanging normal money to cryptocurrency which requires a point of trust.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:51:52
It is kind of funny, but presumably people want to think of these services as legitimate and they need to be shamed into being better.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:06:59
From their site: Authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority: 531127 and HM Revenue &amp; Customs: 12500717 
So it's a normal, regulated financial institution. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:36:51
No, I said it was trivial to automate the notifications. Building an exchange platform is nontrivial, and anyone who can build such a platform can trivially add the notifications. Learn to read. Reputable businesses actually do routinely email their customers. Online businesses also close accounts and shutter. They typically EMAIL the users informing them as such, giving them a timeframe to vacate their assets. Also note the OP has shown that they have erased transaction history to cover their own ass.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:04:35
You're encouraging criminal behavior. 'Go out of their way' we have these things called computers that automatically send notifications for all kinds of things. Does Facebook 'go out of their way' to tell you some guy from high school posted a pic of his dog when they email you? No. It's basic procedure. You'd think a technology company would have that in place. Or maybe they're STEALING until you ask for it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:57:39
I don't understand what you mean. You send them the coins to make trades with the expectation that you can withdraw them. If I deposit money into my stock brokerage account it's not their money even though they are managing it. If the stock broker decided to take my money without notifying me in any way that would be considered theft by just about everyone. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:03:40
Why do you people tolerate the shittiness of these services in the first place. It's not normal to assume that your shit will disappear at any time. Shouldn't instead we make these companies accountable if you actually want cryptocurrency to be viable?

Your status as a functional member of society is threatening.
