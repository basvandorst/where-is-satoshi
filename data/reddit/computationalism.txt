Bitcoin has earned it's keep because it was the first crypto and has name recognition for the general public so institutional money has pumped it up. Not because it's technologically superior to certain alt-coins. Fact is there's better options out there for anything you want to do.

I love how this board tries to rationalize it's "investment"
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:23:15
Inflation isn't bad and is necessary in a growing economy/population.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:18:50
This. People are putting their money into alts and ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:22:02
literally hundreds of computer companies back then.

I mean whatever helps you rationalize your loses

You still do. Most banks have savings accounts, CD's and money market funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:30:50
Why would they be more than the FED interest rates?
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:20:31
It's backed by labor, the ability to pay off debts/pay taxes, and the largest economy/military in the world.

**Thinking 11 minutes is fast*
There's already alts that supersede this by leaps and bounds. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:27:03


TBH this isn't unreasonable. If you don't have enough money for the bank to use as credit to issue out a loan, it isn't really profitable to even have you as a client. A small fee of 12 bucks is really just a fee to keep the infrastructure maintained. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:37:25
Why wait when their is a viable alternative out already? You're just a brand loyalist and afraid of change.

They've had the ability to implement sigwit for a while and have yet to do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:24
You should seriously short. It's going to fall because of bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:17
Try getting a job and taking some on some responsibility.

If you find yourself alone, riding in the green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium, and you're already dead! Brothers, what we do in life... echoes in eternity. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:59:21
You can't beat yourself up over hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:06
Completely ignore the fee's and transaction times. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:54
This. 
Cryto is the free market of currency. If one currency is bogged down but another has a problem sovled. i'm not going to sit around and be a brand loyalist until they fix the problem.

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:07
He's right. There are no insider trading laws for forex, futures, and especially crypto which the IRS doens't even have many laws for. Hell congress is aloud to engage in insider trading. You guys are just mad that theirs an alternative to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:31
I can respect that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:10:01
Money gives you options. Simply having the ability to walk away from a job is a huge burden off your shoulders. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:47


Your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:00
Seems like you need to sort yourself out, bucko. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:12:53
And people are investing in this new asset class in the hopes of it going up in price and earning a profit
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:21:31
I just looked at ethereums price...you're right
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:39:50

@_date: 2018-02-06 22:04:35
Nothing wrong with inflation. You need it for a growing economy and population.

LE bitcoin will bring about a socialist utopia?!?!
We're already seeing inequality with the ownership of crypto.

Paypal is literally a better and more secure way of transporting money online.

You can by a sandwich from some local Indy restaurant in Seattle?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:42:41
People are realizing that it's an overpriced asset that has no practical utility. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:56:33
The got the legs of a gril
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:06:58
Not as fast as bitcoin

@_date: 2018-02-05 23:51:25
Its like investing in forex but buying Zimbabwe or Somalian currency 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:01:18


Because they have to report wire transfers over 10k to the feds. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:40:52
They're saying

Pay your taxes and invest it in real assets.

technologically speaking bitcoin is the least advanced crypto.

big money is invested in crypto...
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:42

Until crypto produces a tangible good or service and pays a dividend, stop comparing it to stock.
