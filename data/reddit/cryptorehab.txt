^this guy sold his bitcoin after gox.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:33:05
Bitcoin core? what is that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:37:17
Yes, good luck trying to time it perfectly every time. Also trading fees.

Coinbase makes something that is usually a headache, quite effortless. The fees are not unreasonable for someone who can’t figure their way into an exchange.

“Obviously, this is far from an exact science. Bitcoin's price could easily double in the coming months. Or the price could plunge by 80 percent, as it did after the last two big bitcoin booms in 2013.”  
This should be at the very top of the article, could’ve saved myself two minutes.

There are cheaper ways to send your bitcoin, but yeah that sounds normal when you’re doing Coinbase &gt; ledger.

What are the Koreans doing?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:25:35
Truth is, none of us know what’s going on! Go with your gut and hope you’re right!!

Thanks for contributing to the discussion. :)

It blew past 9000 with no correction, which leads me to believe it is likely a bubble..we shall see!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:15:32
BUY now. 2nd profit grab just happened, people will now start buying the dip...expect 10k by Monday. 
Not from the future, just a shmuck with a good gut.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:39:10
Care to elaborate? Interested in why these some think so, as I disagree.,
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:28:21
Seems like people are spreading FUD. I wouldn’t worry.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:07:50
There was nothing wrong with this video. Turn the shill down dude, it’s okay to take a step back and look at the negatives. Though comparing it to the tulip bubble is really, really stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:42:31
I mean...these price gains are insane, it’s not like the Bitcoin I’ve been following for the past 6 years...makes me uneasy lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:39:52
Look at btc from 2010-2017 in a graph. Looks like btc is just getting started.
