I recently entered the 6 figures and became more and more nervous. The small 5-10% decreases that used to only take out $1000 now take out more than I make in a month time. What I’ve learned is that 5-10% is no big deal here. We are early investors. Other markets are stable because they have found their correct prices, we’re just waiting for ours.

To clarify, you must have 21 btc to be in this club right?

Jeez, I’m so sorry. We live in a messed up work :(

I found it weird how 10k and 22k are grouped so close together. Following this chart, wouldn’t we dive down now below 10k?

As a 19 year old, this is my dream by the time I hit 31. Best of luck man

I don’t think a belief can cause the price drop. Looking back on when BTC was hitting $4.5k, Goldman Sachs stated it would dip to $2,200 which we never saw despite the fact that many believed it.

Everything is clogged. If you are cashing out, sell on an exchange for some other coin and export that

No worries man, best of luck to you

Would you be willing to sell? I don’t have a 3D printer and would love one. Willing to pay via bitcoin or Litecoin :)
