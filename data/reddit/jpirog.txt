You could dispute it on those, with the coin you can't.

I'd recommend buying a hard drive to USB reader. That way you don't have to do anything with it and you can just access the files. Easiest way. They're pretty cheap as well and always handy to have around
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:16:16
So you want someone to come up with a topic and give you all the research for you? I know who's not getting that degree
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:39:47
Some stupid game that literally kills people slowly but surely. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:23:51
$11 is still more than 1 cent though. I don't have any bch but I also don't want to pay more than $5 for a transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:34:00
The biggest reason is because of the spam. I agree, it needs to be addressed but if you have hundreds of thousands of less than one cent transfers just to spam your network, yeah it's going to cause issues. Just like a DDOS can take down almost any type of network infrastructure.

Your privates are showing..
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:25:55
It is not solely on those reports..
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:05:25
So why don't you enlighten us on some of this information you have? Wouldn't that be better to provide real information than to pretend?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:47:10
Yeah...the penalty of digital currency for instant transactions shouldn't be higher cost. There are so many other currencies that have instant transfers for almost no cost or minimal. I love bitcoin, but it needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:41:22
Yes very productive post.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:42:04
Ooh misread. In two weeks
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:39:44
Damn, again and again and again and again
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:53:44
Look at the graphs of every year around this time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:05:58
You're a poor soul. I feel really bad for you.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:59:33
I'm 13 and still call people fags.


@_date: 2017-12-21 14:29:14
So what about this current push? There's actual volume, that's even higher than the original
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:26:27
Why build, invest it. And you'll gain much more
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:02:43
I don't have any Bcash but the price still went from sub1000 to over 3000 and seems to be staying consistent. I'm just observing what the numbers are saying.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:26:17
Ah, subtle joke I like it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:22:38
Yes. You can't handle this, get out now
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:01:19
Wow, that's very interesting. I thought about running one but not sure now considering that upload
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:28:59
I know you said you won't donate to people, but I'd like to help my sister out a bit. Her daughter has a lot of health issues and essentially lived in the NICU for months and her bills are piling up because of that. Obviously, I would gladly give you her information to talk to her if you end up changing your mind.
I also sent this to her so she can decide which ALS fund to request! My dad just passed a few months ago from ALS and she likes to help them out as much as she can. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:13:39
Just because it worked doesn't mean you're not an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:44:02
Neat! Looks fun
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:45:30
Because you're waiting on your bank transfer..
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:19:48
Damn he overpaid
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:36:12
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:40:28
monero, stellar, ethereum would be my bet
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:06:49
You gotta stop spamming this.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:12:48
I bet he's willing to return 1000x the trade too! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:15:44
Go away.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:27:03
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:14:58
It would be nearly impossible to guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:55:08
I created a keepass db with ALL my crypto in it and sent it off to my best friend. A backup with instructions or to someone who already knows is a must, at least for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:13:19
Or just refresh the page. You should never have power cycle your own hardware unless you're having issues with your internet as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:33:40
Haha what is this crap
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:19:21
I'd eat a Klondike bar
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:14:20
Ooh nice! Makes sense
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:46:24
I thought about this same exact thing, and being 'young' still I said I wanted to do something just in case. Because I have accounts spread out everywhere will multiple wallets and keys etc...
So my contingency plan that only one person knows what to do with it (and the only one who could figure out what to do with the information) out of my friends - I have a flash drive and created essentially backups of everything keys and password offline and shoved it into a multilevel encrypted archive (tar/zip) file. He has the password needed to ever unlock it and a separate password to get into each individual wallet that only we know from a long long time ago.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:35:11
No idea, never used one.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:03:25
Holy crap, how many times are you going to post this.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:31:10

Enjin has been way better for me imo
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:47:23
I don't disagree he understand the market. A broken clock is right twice a day.

Just happened to sell at LTC's actual all time high and just so happen to say there's going to be a huge drop.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:00:05
I think REAL price of BTC by the end of the year will be 25k. Give or take a few thousand.
