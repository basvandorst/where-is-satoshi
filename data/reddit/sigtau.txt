Yes.  15% gratuity was factored into the final cost.

Yep, that'd be the place!  They had to call the owner to get him to bring his smartphone in, but he lives next door so it was a non-issue waiting on that.

Roommate here.  We decided it was best to get two because why not?  We've never eaten there before, it was worth a shot.

Thanks, asshole. &lt;3

Cheesy, delicious, and smothered in butter.  Stained the paper plates we carried the slices in.
TL;DR: It was good.

Damn it, I screwed up the title.  *Yes* I should integrate bitcoin into my payment process, but the question is *how*?  (see the original post for my delimma)

I don't know about you, but if the 0.014 we spent on that is worth 1.4 million in the future, I would just drop out of school now and take BTC commission for the rest of my life.

It's likely to be a small volume unless I get Reddit DDoSed by posting it to or or something.
I think the question would be mainly how I poll the blockchain via PHP  to check for a transaction and the number of confirmations on the transaction.  From that question it'd be an issue of how many confirmations I should wait for before I call the transaction "good" and able to be put into the SQL database as valid.

Yeah so I'm totally that sexy roommate in the plaid shirt.
Ask me anything, preferably about the experience at the pizza place.  [(proof here)](

Just bought myself an individually named card.  Reasonably priced, too.
