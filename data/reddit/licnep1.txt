In europe it is actually illegal for a merchant to charge different prices based on payment methods, the processing fees always have to be paid by the merchant. 
This is retarded of course, it was probably lobbied by credit card companies to compete with cash, otherwise no one would use credit cards if merchants were allowed to turn the credit card fees to the consumers. 5% is a bit too much, but if anything this law should be lobbied against, so that transaction fees are finally transparent to the consumers, and the cheaper options (like bitcoin and cash) will prevail, or credit card companies will be forced to lower their fees.

It's near a all time high, in general, I would advise not buying near all time high prices, as you are more likely to lose money. I'd suggest to wait for a dip in the price, and after the whole hard fork situation has settled down a bit.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:08:11
lots of people bought in to get the free bcc, so at least part of that money will flow out. 
No real reasons to justify bitcoin price going up now, the fork has brought a lot of uncertainty, as it kinda conflicts with the idea that there can only be 21 million bitcoins ever. So yes, I think price is more likely to go down than up, I imagine it will touch 1800 but even 1000 is not unlikely, before starting to climb back up.

that's how difficulty adjustment works on all blockchains, if it gets low hash power, the difficulty will go down. The change they made was to make the difficulty adjustment faster compared to the legacy blockchain, because otherwise it would have taken months. 
Some altcoins have very fast difficulty adjustment compared to btc.

the whales are waiting for lower bcc prices, at least from the chats I'm in. They are starting to place low ball buy orders in the bcc books now. They are waiting to buy bcc when it dips, selling their btc. But then again these is only a small sample of whales i know, there are others around and I don't know if they have the same plan, but the ones I know are going to do this.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:46:26
You can do it on deribit
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:41:13
hard to say, I think the whales are still waiting for people to manage to get bcc on exchanges and dump the price, before moving from btc to bcc. They have a lot of money so they'll try to do it slowly and not get noticed or the price will crash too fast.
Price has been extremely steady... calm before the storm?
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:36:22
there is a bunch of people who say they are dumping bcc for btc, so basically they sell their "free" bcc to buy back more btc. If they had 1btc before now they have 1.15 . So this would make the bcc price go down and the btc price go up (more demand). 
But this is what small holders are doing i believe. On the other side of the trade, selling btc and buying more bcc, i think there's whales with more money, but i think they're still waiting for lower prices to move a majority of their holdings. 
Then again i dont really know, would need to know how everyone in the market is behaving, i only have a few datapoints from users with little and big bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:08:12
You understand that this was all planned right? 
If no blocks are found for 12 hours the fast difficulty adjustment mechanism will lock in, and that's exactly why the miners stopped mining for 12 hours. 
This will mean that for at least 6 blocks the difficulty will go down 20% per block, bringing bcc difficulty at around 26% the current btc difficulty.
At current market prices this difficulty adjustment will make bcc more profitable to mine and more miners will switch over, starving the legacy chain while the bcc chain gains higher throughput. 
This was all planned, you are watching a highly strategic war playing out. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:46:31
I think he's referring to something like "child pays for parent" (cpfp, google it). So instead of making one transaction, two are made, the first one doesn't pay fees, while the second spends the output of the first transaction and pays the fees. So if the miners can only collect the fees if the first transaction is not malleated, so this economic incentive structure makes it so that transactions are not malleated. 
This is how i understand it, not sure if it's the right interpretation. I think he talks about this more in another talk, maybe in this one 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:18:26
why having people use a second layer solution where you have to open payment channels and use additional software, where bitcoin itself could scale to that level on it's own. 
To be honest I understand where you're coming from, cause I loved the lightning idea, and also segwit until i looked into it. I thought segwit2x was the best compromise, but then the more i looked into the details the more i realized that it's a very bad piece of engineering and it's a frankenstein of the original bitcoin. So I changed my mind and I'm now in favor of the bcc fork. Seems like more people are feeling this way, but we'll see if it ends up being a majority or not
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:40:13
satoshi's vision was for bitcoin to be used for payments and scale to compete with VISA. The 1MB cap was just introduced temporarily to protect against flooding attacks because btc was worth nothing. 
It is totally possible to make bitcoin scale that much if the block size is increased. The idea that people should be able to mine on raspberry pi's is preposterous and they can't do that even now (and I say mine, because only mining nodes count). 
Bigger blocks are a more elegant scaling solution, with a smaller attack surface, and lower fees. I don't see why people would prefer segwit +the lightning network. Furthermore that will mean less transaction fees for miners, and potentially less demand for btc as it would just be a settlement layer. 
I will stick to the satoshi version cause that's what i believed in since the beginning, but you are free to invest in the segwit altcoin if thats what you prefer. We'll see which version will win in the end.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:38:07
Lots of people read the whitepaper in 2009, I read the whitepaper that year too. If you were hanging out in the right irc channels / mailing lists / forums, it was already talked about quite a bit in 2009. 
Anyway, apart from your ad-hominem, I don't think you can disagree with him from a technical standpoint. Bitcoin cash is an implementation of Satoshi's paper, and in fact it would even be compatible with earlier version of the software which didnt have the 1MB cap. Segwit is a different protocol altogether, not the one described in the paper. In fact, many altcoins are much closer to Bitcoin than segwit is. 
This does not mean one is necessarily better or worse, but from a technical standpoint Bitcoin cash is definitely closer to the current Bitcoin, whereas segwit brings major changes to it.

No, 8MB is a maximum block size, just like 1MB is a maximum block size for Bitcoin. Not every block has the same size.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:39:31
I beg to differ. I have been in bitcoin since 2009 and and I just recently flipped my position to be fully short bitcoin and long bcc. 
I know segwit, it's against satoshi's original vision, the segwit chain is not bitcoin. Segwit coins (less secure and just a high-fee settlement network) are inherently worth less than big blocks bitcoins. We'll see if time proves me right.
The old money believes in bigger blocks and is against segwit: 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:54:24
I agree, Satoshi is not perfect, but a coin that follows a different vision is an altcoin imo. And I would argue that many altcoins are technically better than bitcoin, bitcoin just has a first mover and branding advantage, but it has always been technically inferior to pretty much all altcoins. Bitcoin is "the first", and there's more money in it than any other alt. But my feeling is that after the fork, the bitcoin with bigger blocks will be more "bitcoin" than the segwit bitcoin, which is different enough to be an alt-coin imo. So my feeling is that a lot of the old bitcoin money will consider BCC as bitcoin and not segwit-coin. I consider myself one of them and that's my feeling, but we'll see what the others feel.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:44:57
well, miners have the power in bitcoin, that's how it's designed. Not users, not "full nodes", just miners, they have the highest stakes in the system and the most power. If you don't like it crypto is not for you. 
Now the asicBoost thing is another problem, but I'm pretty sure more than one player will implement it even if it's technically patented, and the BCC chain could also introduce ways to mitigate it in the future. This is not bitmain's chain, it is just a Bitcoin closer to the original

He gave the commit rights to Gavin Andresen, who is still in favor of big blocks. Gavin decided to give commit access to other people too, and those people ended up ousting him. 
Anyway, what I mean is, if you looked purely at the code of the two forks, a blind test would say that the BCC chain is an implementation of the satoshi paper (it is), whereas the segwit coin is a completely different protocol.
Now, as you said, satoshi never liked to be a dictator, he believes in free market capitalism and competition. The hard fork represents exactly what he believed in, he believed that in these cases the network should fork, and the mining power and economical power will vote on which chain is the best. This is what we are going to witness. To me the big blocks coin is more valuable and is truly Bitcoin, others think differently, we will see in the end who has the money and computational power to back it up.

Craig Wright is Satoshi, its pretty clear to people who were involved early, except those who have a strong interest in keeping their power. But I don't need to convince you, I'm sure you'll figure it out with time. Some people take longer than others. Will be good fun when Satoshi dumps all his segshit altcoins on the market.

I'm not personally hoarding bitcoins (just 0.08btc), so I don't really have this problem. If i was, you're right i most likely wouldn't pay taxes on it (but i would also be ok with being convicted for tax avoidance if what i did was deemed illegal).
Like i said i want to SUPPORT the bitcoin economy and hoarding currency is the worst thing you can do to any economy, I wish more people understood this. Hoarding is the biggest possible crime against humanity. Any second you're holding money you're killing the economy by slowing down money. We must always spend, spend, spend. Money not spent is useless and meaningless. 
If people keep hoarding bitcoins the economy will collapse, just like it's happening to other currencies. With regular currencies the hoarding problem presents itself in the form of debt though, cause entities with a lot of money don't spend it but loan it instead, expecting an increased return. It looks like they're not hoarding, but in fact they are, it's just another mathematical form for the exact same problem. At a certain point the total amount of debt in the economy will become impossible to sustain, causing defaults or runs to other currencies. This is what i believe, at least.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:55:17
99% of the legit demand for bitcoins (not speculation) is already for illegal stuff, be it silk road or money laundering. It's not like those people care wheter btc is "legal" or not. This means even if it was indeed made illegal (i highly doubt it for many reasons) there would still be a multi trillion dollar market where bitcoin can thrive.
Btw, i doubt they will (or even can) make it 'illegal'. They'll try to tax it if anything, 
but not make it illegal.

stability doesn't necessarily mean a constant value, i would consider a varying but predictable value as stable as well.
The supply of bitcoins is predictable, as opposed to regular currencies, and that's a good thing. If the economy is expanding then you'll see exponential growth in value, but it's not that scary if you look at it in a logarithmic scale.

From wikipedia:

I like where you're going, decentralized power is a good thing, but entirely free markets aren't the solution either. Unregulated free markets often lead to monopolies, and that goes against the decentralization of power. 
I'm really annoyed by anti money laundering laws as the owner of a business involved in financial transactions, but i also came to understand why they're important. At least blockchain could offer this service under a different name to avoid being shut down entirely and putting its regular users at risk. While it's financially appealing, i think making money out of money laundering is immoral.
I don't think the decentralization of power you want will happen with increased privacy. It will happen when we have LESS privacy. Attach a camera to the forhead of every congressman and make it stream the video 24/7 on the web. That would stop corruption, not allowing politicians the uttermost privacy of their communications and financial transactions. Then one day maybe we can stop having politicians altogether and use some public p2p network like bitcoin for voting and taking decisions too... (though crowds are often not that smart so i'm not sure that would work)
(On a side note, Berlusconi got his money before being the center of power. His first companies were financed by the father's bank which was a small bank famously used by the mafia for money laundering. Then he received even more money in cash and no one knows where that came from either. He has lots of offshore bank accounts and shell companies, he's been convicted for buying congressmen and judges for several millions. He went into politics only AFTER he started being prosecuted, with the mission to change the law to protect himself and his criminal friends, under the pretense to be a libertarian)

You're right, the sample is probably "people who care enough about bitcoin to browse bitcoin forums", rather than "people who use bitcoins" (as i'm guessing it was posted on bitcoin forums). 
But I'd guess the number is pretty valid for the entire bitcoin userbase (the vast majority of which is computer nerds).
Men have higher testosterone levels which means they are bigger risk takers, they like trading and gambling. Most people with a profund interest in computer stuff are male, but probably that in part due to the way we raise kids (

I'm not from the US but from what i've heard i'm entirely against it, I agree.
I was thinking mostly about european anti-money laundering laws. Here in Italy, for example, money laundering is a huge problem. Ever wondered why Berlusconi is so powerful and keeps getting elected? Money laundering plays a huge part (but it's hard to prove). Do you think it's a good thing to allow the mafia to directly finance the law makers with no way to ever prove they did it? Money laundering laws try to prevent that and many other things. 
The patriot act is an extreme, but the other extreme is also bad. If we don't give the police the right to enter private property or wiretap communications or get access to the logs of banks and websites (if they have a good reason to do so) then lots of huge criminals will never be convicted. On the other hand selling drugs or being "suspected" of terrorism shouldn't be crimes.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:54:07
of course the lower the better ;) but i understand you have to cover the risk and the credit card fees (+a margin to cover costs and possibly profit).
As a seller of digital goods i think 10% could be fine (considering google,apple and facebook take a 30% cut on their in app purchases...) but if we're talking about physical goods with a lower margin or about buying bitcoins, lower fees would be desirable.
If you get this to work i'll be pretty excited, I've been thinking about it for a while but was afraid the chargeback risk would be too high and hard to mitigate without making it cumbersome for the user. Hope you have found a good solution (i had a few ideas myself, we can talk about it if you want)

@_date: 2013-02-23 19:01:49
hehe, i'm not implying that... ;) but it's a fact that the mainstream coverage has focused a lot on silkroad and bitcoin's illegal uses. If people start believing that bitcoins are only good for criminals and drugs addicts (and i'm seeing a lot of comments like that on mainstream websites), then we're giving a huge leverage for governments/banks to bash Bitcoin and/or make it illegal. 
I'm positive Bitcoin will succeed anyway, but if we pay attention to its image in the mainstream media it could be even more successful.

I developed something like this for myself, but you need some programming knowledge to be able to use it:
You put it on a server, put the secret stuff in a folder that is encrypted with a password (so you don't have to trust the server provider). You give this password to a trusted person, like your father. When you die your father goes on the website and inserts the password to decrypt the folder. 
It doesn't decrypt immediately, it first sends you an email and you have a period of time to stop the decryption procedure if you're still alive.

iirc, illicit drug market is several hundred billions a year.
money laundering alone is around 3 trillions a year, iirc.
It's no small markets, and there's a real demand and need for something like bitcoin there. I think OP is right when he says they will (and already have actually) generate the initial demand for bitcoin, cuase those are the people that really NEED it. They can accept the initial high volatility and risk for the advantage it gives them. It IS the initial use case for bitcoin. For merchants to actually use bitcoins (=denominate prices in it) it has to become extremely stable first, and that won't happen for a while. In the meantime maybe we'll see merchants accepting it but converting immediately to fiat, and as the volatility lowers it can start being used for frictionless cross border transactions and internet microtransactions.
OP's scenario is clearly optimistic, but identifying illegal transactions as the initial market is correct imo.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:36:57
To be honest i think this is routine and has to do with some new anti-money-laundering regulation. My bank (barclays) also called a couple weeks ago with respect to an update of anti-money laundering norms, and asked if i was using the account for personal or business activities. 
To be fair i _did_ use that account for buying some bitcoins on bitstamp over a year ago (about 15 euros), but i really doubt that was the reason of the call. I'm more inclined to think there's some new anti-laundering regulation which is requiring banks to call all their clients and ask if they use their account for personal or business reasons.
OP probably is using that account mainly for coinbase, and the bank just made the usual call "Hi, It's Diana from Wells Fargo, we're calling with regards to new anti-money laundering regulations. Are you Mr OP? What are you using your account for?"
OP probably shat his pants thinking they're investigating him or somehting, but i'm fairly sure this was just a routine call.

They have to call clients and ask this question because of some new anti money-laundering regulation.

Money laundering is as victimless as much as suppression of evidence after a murder is "victimless". Money laundering is not really a crime per se, but it's used to hide and finance bigger crimes.


If that was the real cause they would have made a law to make all bank accounts and transactions accessible to the government at all times, instead they can only be accessed if a serious crime is being investigated. This proves the law was made to fight crime and not to control the population.

I'm sorry, I'm not particularly familiar with this idea of "markets regulated strictly by consumption" (maybe you could expand on that?), but maybe what i refer to as "unregulated markets" coincides with what you're referring to as "markets regulated strictly by consumption".
If it's the idea is to ONLY use consumption to regulate markets, i'm not sure it can work. It would work in many cases, but not all of them. 
Say there are two companies controlling all the oil wells and they decide to make a cartel and fix the oil price to make more money, what can the markets do? They NEED oil so they can't stop buying it. And they can't buy the wells either unless the companies want to sell them. 
Also, there would have to be a lot more transparency in order for "markets regulated by consumption" to work well, transparency needs to be forced. Otherwise say two companies sell the same kind of food but one is using very bad ingredients to lower the price and people don't know it, they will buy from the bad company and put the honest ones out of business (same for, say, an energy company who saves money by not disposing their nuclear waste properly). Other problem, businesses from any one industry could choose to make their clients sign anti-competitive contracts which make it costly or hard to switch to the competition.
Also, if you have a lot of money you can buy the media and politics and make even more money, in a self perpetrating loop people couldn't be able to stop cause the media and politics have been bought. 
I'm a libertarian at heart, but I'm also a realist and i think free markets alone are not the solution that maximizes the common good. Some things must be regulated by laws, like transparency, anti-competitive behaviour, and others...

Makes sense. In that case, though, they could keep the logs, and i'd be perfectly fine with the service. But the fact that they advertise removal of all logs after 8 hours goes against all anti money laundering laws ever. 
I'm not against freedom, they are free to do it (if they don't someone else will anyway). But I won't personally use(=support) such a service, and I think they should do it under a different legal entity, because this exposes the entire blockchain.info at risk of legal repercussions.

I may help out a little if i have some free time. When you have a website/forum/irc/anything let me know, and i'll see if i can be of nay help
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:22:46
but that's the entire point of bitcoin, that it can't be put down.
It's like torrents. Granted, the MPAA hates them, but they can't shut them down.

They're NOT investigating coinbase. There was a recent update in anti money laundering regulations so banks all over the world are making these kind of calls. I got a similar call from barclays a couple weeks ago. 
They asked for my information, and asked if i was using the account for personal or business purposes (they clearly had my balance in front of them cause the woman said something like "i see mortgage payments, i'm guessing this is a personal account? correct?").
Chill out, this is NOT specific to coinbase. Just banks trying to comply with some new regulation.

Yea, if i understand correctly there are a total of 100 billion XRPs and each can be divided in millionths. Like you say, I heard that the fees for a transaction can vary upon consensus. Still, a minimum fee of a millionth of an XRP will be required. 
That would mean, if i understand correctly, that there's a limit of about 100,000 trillions transactions... 
I don't like the idea of a protocol that can run out of transactions, but I gotta admit that's a pretty big number, so it probably won't be a problem...
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:42:57
haha, good question...
anyway I imagine if you looked at the early adopters of computers or cellphones you'd find a pretty similar userbase (middle aged men). It's probably just a matter of time till it spreads to other segments of the population, I wouldn't worry too much.

What Bitcoin needs most is probably a good marketing campaign. 
We need to contrast the idea that Bitcoin is an illegal currency for drugs, make it good. Something used by good people to do good things.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:01:58
awesome :D would be nicer if it was clearer you can pay with bitcoins tho, can't see that anywhere.
I'm actually considering buying a few of these lol
oh shit you don't ship internationally :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:05:39
It's not 100% untraceable, nothing is, but there are ways to make it pretty untraceable, depending who you buy the bitcoins from and how much you shuffle them around. If you use several addresses there's plausible deniability you own all those addresses. Not if they seize your computer before you wipe the data though...
The way the average user uses it it's 100% traceable

I'll let you know if I do ;), I doubt it's impossible. Chargebacks are a big issue but it's something everyone has to deal with, they're not specific to bitcoins. The exchange should simply:
1. Put a transaction limit. 2. create a blacklist of credit cards used for chargebacks and stop accepting them. 3. charge an arbitrary exchange fee 4. adjust the fee over time to correct for the chargebacks while still making a profit (5. (opt) try prosecuting the scammers).
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:23:37
In my opinion yes, but maybe it is legal. I sure wish there was an anti-trust lawsuit forcing them to change this policy. Facebook and android have a similar policy, you can only use their own payment system in your app (which gives facebbok/google/apple 30% of the revenue). 
Shit sucks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:42:12
Yes, let's fuel the bubble some more! Vive la deflation! Hoarding good, spending bad.
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:30:57
thanks for the info. I agree with you that these regulations are a burden for small companies, being designed for big, established companies. 
I guess the intentions of the regulators are good, but they seem to forget about young startups, which, in my opinion, should be given less strict rules until they reach a certain volume/age.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:34:03
oh i see. Makes sense.
@_date: 2013-03-08 03:54:14
In this case yes. But the problem of money laundering is certainly not specific to politics. 
It's about being able to follow the money trail, seize riches obtained illegally, convict more criminals,.
If a mafia guy gets paid a lot to do mafia stuff (threatening and killing people, burning properties, stealing etc.) it would be nice to be able to prove where all that money went afterwards so it can be seized. With a system like send shared™ they can just open a facade store, get all the money through send shared™ and pretend it came from lawful activities. There would be no way to prove where the money comes from. People would be buying villas and yacht at the expense of good people. There's a reason why this shit is illegal everywhere. 
Bitcoin can go either way, it can either be used to promote transparency of transactions, or do the opposite. I think the former is a great opportunity. Say an exchange gets hacked. We can all see the address/es where the bitcoins are sent, and the network as a whole could choose to stop accepting transactions from that address or even force a transaction from the thief's wallet back to the exchange (and its users). This would be awesome, but something like send shared™ would make it impossible.

SEPA transfer from my bank (fee &lt;1€, depends on your bank). Appeared in my account next day. Very satisfied overall, good service.
If you're in the EU it's a great option.

Yes, it's from the trailer of "The Wolf of Wall Street", not out yet.

they sell domains (eg. reeeeedit.com) and related stuff.
They're of the biggest companies in that area. I use them for all my domains.
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:46:25
It only affects them if you can convert the credits back to fiat, otherwise you're basically selling a product not offering a payment system.
Anyway money laundering laws are not that hard to comply with as far as i know. If i recall correctly they basically say you should keep a record of all transactions and you should notify the authorities if you see anything suspect. Not too hard.

@_date: 2013-05-22 19:09:52
but you can use credit cards and wire transfers to pay for things as long as you want, even if your money is loaned out to other people.
You can't pay to a Bitcoin address if you don't have the bitcoins. I think you're thinking of a system of debt denominated in bitcoins, not of Bitcoin, and it would require another protocol to work. I think you know what i mean.
The Bitcoin money supply cannot be increased. M0 can't be increased (unless there's a hard fork). M1-3 of **bitcoins** can't be increased (if people start transacting in loans denominated in bitcoins, then it can, but we're not talking about the Bitcoin protocol anymore).

@_date: 2013-02-20 21:48:32
Duh. That's true for regular companies too. There aren't enough dollars in circulation to buy, say, Apple,Samsung and Exxon at the same time, or enough dollars to pay back the entirety of the us debt.

Oh god, yes. It has the potential to turn into an awesome episode, it's a perfect topic for south park.
They will make fun of us but it would be worth it!
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:05:56
Are ripples (XRP) truly necessary? (or is it just a scheme for the devs to make money)
Who should a regular user trust normally?
extra: 
If XRPs are destroyed on each transaction, does that mean the absoulte number of transactions is limited?
@_date: 2013-11-16 04:47:14
It's not really a vote. It's quite complex, you have to understand how the blockchain works to get it:
The main idea of bitcoin is the blockchain, which is the one and only list of transactions regarded as true by the majority of people in the network. It's a distributed, public ledger. The network is entirely peer to peer, there's no central server, so you can get a list of peers ad connect to them to join the network. When you connect initially you download the blockchain so you have a local copy too and you are synchronized with the rest of the network. Then when you want to make a transaction you want to get it written in the blockchain so you broadcast the transaction to other peers.
If these peers agree that the transaction makes sense (you are spending bitcoins you own, you are following the protocol's rules), they will put it in a list of transactions to confirm. Now, to actually get the transaction in the blockchain, a new block has to be 'mined'. New blocks are mined at a constant rate. A new block contains a list of accepted transactions (including your own). 
At any given time, the peer in the network will only consider the longest blockchain to be the real one. What does this mean? Let's say you make a transaction and broadcast it to peers A,B,C,D.  D doesn't like you so he decides to reject your transaction and not put it in his blockchain. He will mine a new block without your transaction in it. But A,B and C, the good nodes (the majority) will accept your transaction and mine a new block with it. Now we have two blockchains, one with your transaction in it, and one without it. But as A,B and C outnumber D, they will mine blocks faster, so their blockchain will grow faster than D's, and will eventually be accepted as the real blockchain (as it's the longest one). 
So basically, some change is accepted in the blockchain only if the majority of peers accept it. Divisions can also happen (called blockchain fork) where two factions are working on different blockchains, but generally it's in the best interest of the smallest blockchain to join the biggest one, as that will be accepted by most peers.
Shit, I'm sure this post isn't clear at all, I won't even proofread it, it's a confusing topic. If you have questions let me know. I'm not an expert but i have some generic knowledge.
