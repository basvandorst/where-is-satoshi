At least you can say you've now done a public service by officially convincing me NEVER to deal with MtGox :D

This is interesting. Technologically, look at

You have to confirm your account to get BTC out?!? What a pain!

It's a huge pet peeve of mine when an organization owns a domain and still publishes free email addresses. May I suggest setting up email (with google or otherwise) on your domain and using contact
I perceive this as the equivalent to a brick-and-mortar business operating out of a tuff shed in an alley.

I haven't personally used Mt. Gox but, if possible, I suggest buying bitcoin with the USD and transferring the bitcoin to a place like Coinbase (only because verification is pretty simple) to sell it. Sure, you wont get the same price/btc that you would at Gox but you will at least get your money.

This is not an open source project. 
However, this application takes no username or password. The user must provide an API key (which you generate and control permissions of on HavelockInvestments.com) to the application in order to access your portfolio information. The application walks you through generating an API key and only giving it portfolio read access.
If you only choose the portfolio permission then the API key can only be used to access the following information:
* status: Contains 'ok' or 'error'
* message: Contains error message if applicable
* apirate: API usage rate for the past 600 seconds
* portfolio: Contains array of portfolio objects
Portfolio objects contain: 
* symbol: Fund symbol
* name: Fund name
* quantity: Number of shares owned
* quantityescrow: Number of shares in escrow
* lastprice: Share price of last sale
* bookvalue: Share price at which you bought times quantity owned
* marketvalue: lastsaleprice times quantity owned
The Havelock API documentation is here, and I only use the portfolio endpoint: 
Let me know if you have any interest in participating in alpha/beta versions!

DROID is trademark LucasFilm, Ltd. and used by Verizon in the most consumer-confusing marketing campaign ever. 
The correct term would be Android-powered phone.
Also, go for it and don't look back! :)

I second this. 2FA is just to get into their site. If their site (not simply your account) is compromised then your Coinbase wallet is too.

So poorly done, too.
