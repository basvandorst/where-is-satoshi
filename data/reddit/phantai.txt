LOL. 
No argument, no premise, zero logic. 
Rewrite the definitions for "stealing" and "everyone" all you want. You're still not going to make any sense.

No, a tax evader is not stealing from "everyone." 
Such a TINY amount of tax money actually goes to helping citizens. Elementary schooling gets about a penny from every tax dollar, NASA gets 1/2 a penny, and student financial aid gets 1/50th of a penny. Most of everything else goes directly to private companies who are neither qualified to act in the best interest of the people, nor are motivated to do so.

I honestly can't see how her justifications are legitimate. It doesn't matter what he was caught doing if the investigation was conducted illegally. God damn, what the fuck is America coming to these days?

Been writing a lengthy document in an attempt to verbalize the practical political benefits of adopting Bitcoin. Although, given the amount of people on this sub-reddit who refuse to talk political implications (for whatever reason), I'm not sure if anyone will even give a fuck.

Without a severe change in modern online privacy laws (U.S. be damned!), only the third one is a realistic threat. Even if internet freedoms are limited severely all over the world, just to stomp out BTC, they would be easily circumvented. Buying a pre-paid credit card and renting out a VPN is all you need to do to guarantee complete anonymity (unless you're an idiot about it).
The third point is a real threat. Public image is absolutely vital for the success of Bitcoin, and the BTC community must actively work to nurture a positive image of the currency. I've been mentioned it several times on this subreddit, and sent some people PM's, but it was mostly met with disinterest/apathy.

Please don't mistake Bitcoin for a mere investment opportunity. It is a decentralized currency, which is sound, secure, has virtually non-existant transaction fees. Its infancy makes it volatile and unpredictable, but its strength lies not in price alone. I do not doubt that people may panic and crash the market, but even if BTC crashes below the point at which it is profitable to mine (for anyone), it can still survive. 
 
As long as we see value in it, and as long we understand its strengths relative to broken fiat currencies, it can endure and thrive once more. No matter how badly the currency crashes, it has the potential to rebound to prices MUCH higher than those of today. Basically: Hold onto your Bitcoins regardless what happens in the short term.

Another problem Bitcoin can easily solve :)

Bitcoin needs an organized grassroots education campaign to: a) dispel inaccurate beliefs, b) grow the economy, and c) gain mainstream support. Operating on the fringes of the high-tech is great, but it's a very vulnerable position to be in. If the currency is to succeed, the general public cannot be led to believe that BTC is a fad or a scam.

I understand the motivation behind this sort of thinking, but I disagree. Although we should definitely discourage misinformed blabbing about Bitcoin, leaving the BTC economy to the whims of press/twitter is ill-advised. Without some sort of organized, well-planned lobbying efforts, BTC will be crushed by big finance and big corporate whenever it begins to threaten their oligopolies. The key phrases here are organized and well-planned (see Wall St. Protests for an example of what NOT to do).

This is a special time in the economy of Bitcoin. Certain niches have virtually no competition, and thus vendors are free to set whatever prices they want. As more vendors start dealing in Bitcoin, increased competition will force them to drive prices down or to increase the fidelity/quality to compete. For now, however, decreasing prices may not yield a large enough increase in sales.
Although, your argument would make perfect sense if we were talking about businesses using mainstream currency. In a highly competitive market that uses traditional currency, a reduction of costs would give a merchant a huge advantage in pricing, allowing them to siphon the sales of competitor merchants. If the market is not very competitive (like the case of privatized American health care), low costs do not always translate to low pricing.

Torontonian here. I only discovered Bitcoin last week, and have spent most of my nights catching up. Although I have yet to begin mining (and I am not sure if this is the right direction to go within the economy right now), I would be very interested in getting together to discuss the future potential of Bitcoin. I am particularly interested in organizing a grassroots movement to legitimize the the currency and educate a larger population about its benefits.

I wonder if they'll have any shipping problems? :P
@_date: 2013-03-03 08:32:26
Hmm, interesting. Is there any point to joining the mining party before then?

Because when Bitcoin starts to threaten the oligopolies of large financial institutions, they will start pumping money into media campaigns to damage the legitimacy of Bitcoin. You're going to see news stories on Fox news like "The Crypto-Currency Scam," or some such title that seeks to damage Bitcoin's reputation. People who are not tech-savvy, and who do not understand the difference between BTC and LTC, will eat that shit up no problem.
@_date: 2013-03-05 04:48:19
Agreed. I will be looking into what it takes to organize such an effort. Message me if you are interested :)
