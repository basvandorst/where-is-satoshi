This is a fantastic form of cold storage, is it not?

Fantastic news.

The jurisprudence you have cited will not help you.  Just letting you know.

Honestly, I'm on your side, I think TD is a bunch of asshats, but to explain why not would require a few hours of research which I don't really have time for.
You may have a case, but it's not pursuant to the principles you have outlined.

I know... but I literally don't have 2 hours to spend going through the jurisprudence and highlighting how the Courts have defined "reasonable".
I am on this guys' side dude.  He needs legal counsel, not hearsay from the reddit peanut-gallery.  
EDIT: You know what though, the part that confuses me is the RCMP's reluctance to get involved in this one.  It should be a rather simple process to see who is on the other end of this transaction.  This isn't a raw, BTC-BTC transaction.  Where fiat (not cash) is involved, tracking is fucking easy as pie for authorities.  This is worth over $5,000...
Get legal counsel.  Time to draft some subpoenas.

Doesn't armory do this already?

It's in my head.  How would I lose it?

So... Cryptomator can be cracked?
Even if it is - my Electrum wallet is encrypted as well.

My concern with Hardware wallets is that hardware breaks.
Software on a redundant system will not.

That seed is stored on an encrypted drive.

Duly noted.
Thanks for your input, man!

Let's assume that I will not forget my key.
Is my solution a feasible one?

So... does this fund your education?
Seriously.  Don't send anything to this fucking address.

I literally refuse to go on Forbes website because of their advertisement structure.
