I promise not 2 get ripped off. By the way can i use your bank account 2 launder my millions of dollars with? or maybe just give me your SIN

As a broke ass college student I like being able to tip penny's. It spreads awareness without breaking me financially(i eat a lot of noodles).

@_date: 2014-11-08 01:15:43
are they giving out bitcoins, or just like an informational booth?
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:59:26
i was going to say this. The hard part would be finding a charity that accepts bitcoins. Id suggest rather then giving it to charity maybe you could pay it forward to someone who needs it??

@_date: 2014-11-07 15:50:30
thanks, i recently started using electrum while the core finishes downloading (thanks 2 tips from other redditors). i didnt know that core helps the greater good, i guess ill keep her on my computer once she is downloaded
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:57:05
OP approved
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:23:37
Should add the people who stream games. huge untapped market and i feel that most people there would love a few extra bits
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:27:03
you can gift people steam games via change tip. Its already here
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:50:55
Although i agree with you in the drop of quality content. this type of viral marketing will get thousands more people to join up and start using bitcoin. It got me to finally stop procrastinating, get off my ass and get a wallet
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:47:36
have 20 bits on me, you mother fucker @_date: 2014-11-08 17:12:01
then what? i dont think bitcoins are widely accepted enough to pay for electricity and cable and shit
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:21:11
this is either or im not sure which   
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:29:19
yes, you can transfer funds from wallet to wallet. no issue. try a few out. Id suggest transferring a small amount into a few different wallets and trying them out. (I use Electrum)
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:40:14
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:29:03
why tip redditors, and not just tip out a charity that could actually use the money?
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:06:03
