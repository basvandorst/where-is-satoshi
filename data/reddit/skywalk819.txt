about time.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:39:37
Yeah and pull off the biggest scam of the human history. 
once everything is interconnected with bitcoin and sell his fortune.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:35:41
I'm not sure about that. Yes some people would maybe sell premptively but it could bring immense publicity to Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto Reveal himself! headlines!
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:10:38
Hmm that would be some twisted ideology.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:51:41
Im in a state where I dont give a fuck. I see the dip and it doesnt even affect my portfolio, because im not selling these bitcoins, I want more and more, every day. PAssive income bae.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:36:37
Wow that is my favorite answer so far. Good definition of saving the planet.

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:45:02
well Jamie dimon is a fraud, he should give a public excuse to the bitcoin community and say that he is indeed a fraud himself.
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:14:01
hdd died so its long gone. around maybe +500ish btc lost forever. block rewards was huge at that time and it was worth pennies
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:34:38
Who knows? What do you think?
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:13:00
wish I could find my 2009 wallet, at the time I mined with my CPU, but nope, forever gone
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:46:51
bitcoin bank, what a load of horseshit, why would I want to deposit bitcoin in a bank?
I have no plus value to this, its just giving my coin to a third party and worst, its a real bank, why teh fuck would I want to do this? seriously...
Thats totally useless.
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:30:22

@_date: 2014-03-24 21:12:38
It isnt hard to hold 10BTC in a wallet, thats about all the btc on kraken...
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:06:10
i guess the thief doesnt use reddit.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:32:46
CEO of Air you breath here, sorry you have no authorizations to use this air. It is copyrithed
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:04:55
Well, i thought mtfox would fix their problems but seems like they used the bitcoin maleability bug to steal people bitcoins even if you cant steal bitcoins with this bug. they just stole everyone bitcoin and think they can walk away with it. I dont think so. or if they do i dont think they will walk very far until someone grab a hold of them
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:01:36
just hope whoever buy them will let people widthdraw our funds. i didnt loose much. but i hope i can get my loose since its profit from my mining farm and pay elec bill and tax. if not. pretty much didnt make any money and gox are thiefs

@_date: 2014-04-28 12:24:26
why why, thank you sir!
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:00:27
The problem is, most people on reddit, are from America, the land of the slaves, they reeks of hatred, drugs, alcoolism, prostitution, addiction to fry food, gangsta mentality, pop a pills to fix a head problem, get high on GMO and pesticides, altering their minds, controlled by politicians slaves to banksters, what good can come out of that? They cant even stand for themselves and judge the people around them. They think they are almighty but in reality they a weak. One day they will learn of what they done, I hope, and that day we'll win.
But not yet, not yet
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:58:48
and what about the btc graph behind ?
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:19:27
the people who doesnt have this kind of lifestyle. the people who are for none pollution practice. organic feeding. no vacine. no pesticides gmo. all the bad stuff in the world. im talking in general. most people dont understand that. they want to understand. when u talk about that. they laugh at you or think you are crazy. so we would be everyone else and the people who want to change. it come with a price. but i would say about 10% of world population think like that
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:13:59

@_date: 2018-03-08 16:52:57

@_date: 2018-03-08 16:59:51
20$ where
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:21:43
its ok pal. everything is fine. i dont have time to argu. so ill just give it to you. good job you win. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:19:14
its just people are willing to pay more fees to be approved faster, you just dont undestand what you are talking about and you come argu here with me  go read 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:53:48
There are no problems, ask any dev that arent bitcoin cash devs. and we are borderline mainstream, why? because couple years ago there was no crypto show on cnbc and other tv channel, crypto is mainstream, its the begining of the wave.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:55:49
and segwit split transactions so they can be confirmed faster, reducing backlog and at hte same time decreasing tx fees because people dont pay more fees to be confirmed faster...
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:35:29
the same can be said about any crypto. u are delusional. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:57:08
and I wouldnt be surprised if individuals or groups have flooded the bitcoin network with transactions just to push idea that we need something like segwit, bitcoincash or lightning to solve a "problem".
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:09:18
im not trying to argue with you, you can do all you want, but you said it yourself 95% will fail. whats the plus value in speculating in something that you know 95% of the time it will fail. too risky for what its worth. id rather buy bitcoins, litecoin, ethereum, monero, ... with that money and make a profit or invest in an ICO.... and its gone.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:10:28
i own thousands btc since 2009. 20$ at peak usage. wow poor soul. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:43:34
Yeah its a hoax, i still stand by that, ask any dev, there is no problem as of now. its all FUD started by rogerver.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:12:15
hey rogerKver. remove your mask
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:21:51
How many are ICOs Scam? Probably 90%.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:18:06
go research what are the fees for your TX used for, go check it out, then come back complain about it.. oh you probably arent a miner, so you dont care, you want free transaction, but it doesnt work this way. ur fees are used to sort of put your transaction in the tx queue and the higher you pay, the faster your transaction get approved, if someone pay higher then you and send it at somehow the same time, he will be approved before you, and the fees are added to the block reward of that block, its sort of how this work, so decreasing the txfees, decrease miner rewards a bit. get this approved in the github, then have nodes support your idea and maybe it will be support, but forget it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:56:00
and please dont come to me saying, oh I made a profit bla bla bla, its great, you did a profit, but I will never tell a client to buy in an ICO. ICOs are destroying crypto/bitcoin image.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:52:52
too me. most is all. plus there is no actual mining. they are ethereum tokens. created out of air. and you bet that a project. or company. that you will probably never see in real life overturn any problems they have to do a project. need to allign the stars perfectly for it too succeed. no thanks ico equal scam. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:57:55
how many ICOs are scam? versus how many ICOs succeeded ? I dont need any more saying.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:44:44
I am not buying this Robinhood because 1) Im from canada and it isnt released here and 2) the huge advertisement behind RobinHood, out of nowhere is "the thing" that usually indicate problems in the long term
Will never use robinhood.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:06:00
Maybe Craig want to be pursued in court to give more credibility to his satoshi story... or its the real deal and dave was satoshi and died and craig stole satoshi coins to pretend to be satoshi.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:54:37
icos are scam, whats the point, to look for the ICO that is a gem among a sea of scammers... buy tokens that arent mined, created out of nothing and you hope everything goes as planned to resell your tokens for a profit, just buy actual coins. safer.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:44:23
as a crypto trader/miner/investor for 9 years + I believe there are no legitimate ICO, consider all ICOs as Scam and if you put your money into an ICO well dont be surprised people run away with your money.

They are testing the network for the next move. They want to destroy this currency that is against the goal of the NWO one currency only. BTC is going agains tthe giant that is the global world elite.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:12:42
thats pure bullshit, if you lost ur coins u probably deserved it, and u probably will never see them again, what this do is lower the amount of coins this already limited coins can have. st00pid idea.

@_date: 2013-11-15 17:18:04
whats with this taint bullcrap, do we refuse fiat money bc it was tainted? is there a list of tainted fiat money, this is ridiculous. taint or not taint, a coin is a coin, same thing with business saying, we do not accept 50 or 100 dollar bills here, fuck you, a bill is a bill, it was issued by gov, it is legal. this will not pass.
