Which regulations specifically?  I have seen people say this and read what they posted which  actually had nothing to do with it,  I don't know if you are just repeating fud or actually read through the regulations and were able to directly apply them to the removal of cold storage.

@_date: 2018-01-29 16:00:27
Like you said, every future transaction will now cost less.  With only 7k unconfirmed transactions you can get a tx confirmed for barely anything at all now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:50:18
I think myself and many others have started using other coins.  I use litecoin whenever possible and most of the payment processors now have a ton of coins you can use just as easy.
8k unconfirmed transactions only as of 30 min ago, because less people are using it unfortunately as well.

If people find out that they actually have not been getting $1 for every tether they printed and it was all made up to prop up the btc economy.
Not sure if it will truly drop though as only about $1B worth of tether are inserted in a $250B market.

They will be using coinbase/gdax and they can't magically remove those fees and will most likely just add the fee on as a premium and include it in the "base price".

And create a SegWit address and send the bitcoins there.  Once you have a segwit address all your fees will be cheaper.

I personally think Satoshi died when Hal Finney died.  His last post was only 2 months before Hal's early death and none have come since.
Add that to the fact he was the first person to get Bitcoins from Satoshi it all adds up that it was him, in my opinion.
Those coins aren't moving ever again.

It will expire after 14 days.  Some wallets have "replace by" and you can double spend but just wait the 14 days if you aren't confirmed and then resend again with a higher fee.

Transaction accelerators need to have a shitload of power to even work first of all since they have to choose to include your low fee transaction.  Basically no tx accelerators are working at all and haven't for weeks since the fees are too good.
It will either go through, or get returned to your wallet one or the other.

And yes, it was a CASH deposit that was reversed by the depositor 2 hours after the deposit.

It took me less than 24 hours to get verified on bitfinex, and 1.5 weeks to get verified on bitstamp, and almost 3 weeks to get verified on CampBX.
I am wondering why I wouldn't deposit to bitfinex since they clearly are the most professional of them all, and have the cheapest rates.

Wow that is shady as hell, and that MPOE that comes in and doesn't tell the person they represent bitbet is a total scum move.  Everything that MPOE-PR said was horribly rude and disrespectful as and deceitful at best.  
So much trust on that site for such a shady user, pretty much defines the majority of the current user base of btc sadly, or at least the ones with huge amounts of btc.

I have been selling on localbitcoins using this exact same method, and just a few days ago a CASH DEPOSIT got reversed by a scammer and the credit union is not going to pay me back.  I am trying to get all my documents together then going to take the credit union to small claims court for an unauthorized release of cash funds directly from my account to a random person I never met before.

I had a cash deposit reversed on my and apparently a few other people have too.  I thought it was impossible but it's not and my credit union confirmed that.  I am out $1,200 and a few btc.
After 50+ trades I had to stop using them because I got burned so hard.

It did cost 1 BTC when they were about $100 I think.

Just login to the site and see if the deposit was cash.. if so release the funds.  been no problem for me.

How much cash did it cost to send the wire to bitstamp?  I am wondering if it is even worth it to send $1500 or so due to the fees of the wire, or just keep using coinbase.

Nothing, they deposit cash to my account and I released the bitcoins.  3 hours later they went back to the bank and took the cash out by saying it was a mistake.

The bitcoin fork was completely different because it was a fork in the protocol itself, not just to reverse one bad trade or situation.  Huge freaking difference.  I have a bit of ETH but they are kinda screwed.  If they fork to reverse this all trust is or should be lost.

btc-e hurt for sure but I trade over 5 exchanges to mitigate risk.  I am doing fairly well but I really enjoy it and have learned a lot, the only negative is the bit of sleep loss when you have positions open on margin.  
The key is really just to be patient and know that it's ok to pull out of a bad trade because not every trade is going to end up in the green but you just need more green than not.

I assume they just pay a lesser fee to Bitpay.

@_date: 2017-08-11 21:34:59
Bitfinex was ahead of coinbase and all the others they chose not to get regulated and do business in the US legitly most likely because there is some shady shit going on behind their closed books.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:27:16
Yes there is, same as localbitcoins.
I had hundreds of trades until someone reversed a cash deposit 2 days after they put the cash in my account.
I was out about 8 btc and the cash.  Same thing can happen on bisq.  Filed a police report, claim with the bank, hired a lawyer.  Nothing could be done.

There are pretty much only two ways to manipulate BTC alone without finding a fault in sha-256.  One is to buy mining equipment which in turn secures the network and drives more and more users to it, the other is just buying BTC which in turn drives other buyers.  Both pretty only help the network in the long run.

I am in the US and used to trade all the time on LBC, most in person but some just deposit cash right to my credit union through their credit union or bank.  Someone reversed the money out of my account about 2 hrs after they deposit the cash to my account and I sent the BTC.  Was only out about $3k total between btc I lost, and cash that was reversed but it's way easier than you would think.  All you have to do is say you messed up the transfer and want to reverse it.

The real answer is that psychologically placed shorts were getting called and a world wide market was too strong to stop at a barrier in one currency.  People had to buy BTC to cover the shorts which in turn caused a cascading effect and here we are now like 3 hours later at $10,661.
People will start closing longs to take profits though and things may slow down.

Yeah right on I personally trade on wex, polo, gdax, and hit to spread out my risk of one exchange getting F'd' as was the case with BTC-e which I actually just wrote off $10k or so.  When it came back on since I considered it all lost I just bought as much debt tokens as I possibly could.
I recommend spreading risk out over multiple exchanges which also enables arbitrage opportunity although that is so hard since the bots eat it up so fast.

@_date: 2016-02-16 21:09:26
BTC usually costs over %1 each way, buying and selling, then xfer to bank account from exchanges, easily coming to a total of 3% which is about $180, except  without BTC its all done easy and legit in one system instead of the three it would take for bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong, I use bitcoin more than 99% of the world, but buying bitcoin, selling bitcoin, then transferring it to your bank will always bring the same fee that was $256 at a very easy process, to ~$180 in a very difficult and convoluted way using multiple points where errors can occur to the non savvy user.
Yeah if you already have the bitcoins or mined them yourself 5 years ago this is a moot point, but the fact remains it costs money in fees to both buy and sell BTC which eat up all of your precious words making BTC look like its free to move.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:29:14
Well actually now that I think about it... why did I even care to make the first comment anyways is my real question.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:36:15
Because the scenario laid out is about transferring $$, dollars from a home sale and I clearly doubt he sold the house for btc.   Thus if we want to transfer the cash $$ using the same scenario, it requires all of the steps above I laid out and will not in fact save money compared to the risk, time, and savings.
Again, I have been an active member of the btc community since early 2010 and I love it, just don't bend the facts to make it work where it doesn't since it has many great applications we can use it as an example for.

I made a post 4 years ago on here but must have deleted it for putting out too much info.
Basically cash deposit, released the bitcoins, next day they go to the bank saying something about how they were forced under duress to put the cash in my account.  The bank that did both the deposit and withdrawal was a sister credit union out of state and I had zero recourse.
Consulted with lawyers who said I could fight the credit union but it wasn't worth it.
That was after 200+ positive sale experiences in which I made zero profit, was just trying to spread the word since I believed in it and was doing a lot of mining.

Actually Bitcoin is updated all the time, they are called BIPs, bitcoin improvement protocol and are validated, voted on, used on testnet, and then deployed to Bitcoin which is how you would want responsible open source devs working on a $100B market to behave.

I'm basically going to go to the place with the lowest fees.  I'm liking TH.

I jumped in on the other forum, signed up another redditor, and then gave my wrong code for the next person... so I missed out on that one.

Good luck, any idea of the pricing?

You are doing something wrong because I was getting 609 Mhash/s with 2x 5830.
@_date: 2011-07-24 18:15:07
Because future difficulties actually matters.
@_date: 2011-09-01 22:12:09
Honestly, I got in early May, and bought 3x 5830, and finally paid them off (minus electricity)....  I am done.
I am going to cut my loses, stop mining, be down and out ~$100 (expenses + electricity, minus the btc I sold), but hold on to 10btc.
Not worth having a computer with 3 video cards putting out SO MUCH HEAT, noise, etc...
If you get in right now I would honestly say there is a good chance you will regret it.
I used to watch the ticker every second, stay in the IRC chat, talk about btc and the future, and I am pissed I spent so much time doing it.
All the early adopters made a ton of money, all the late joiners lost a ton, there is always a balance.

Someone already asked a google rep and said virtual currency is availble for sale as long as a company isn't against it.  You will never see WoW gold for sale because Activision-Blizzard won't allow it.

But the fact of the matter is, this individual package went through about 6-10 transitional post offices, that would all have had to made the exact mistake and "overlooked" their official transit stamps, because each post master that touches that package is required to look for two things... one is the address and the other is the crossed stamps.
Who knows...
@_date: 2011-06-18 14:18:27
Yup, do it all the time.  Just like people below said how, stop mining on the first gpu.

If you lose it.... it's called Google Authenticator and then if you need, your phone or any android device generates a 1 time key you use along side your password.  But it's easier to just have the stick and plug it in.
So you would have to lose your phone, the dongle, and also the sheet of 10 1 time passwords that you stick in your wallet.
Basically you don't have any business being on a computer if you fuck that up.

You would have to purchase every single bitcoin UP TO $15........
Not sure how I can explain this better...
If you type you want to purchase 1 BTC @ $15...
There are currently thousands and thousands of coins less than $15, so you would need to purchase every coin up to that amount.
If right now you type in you want to buy 1 coin  it would only charge you $8.244 because that is the LOWEST PRICE someone is asking right now.

So please explain why you are in this sub-reddit if not for the sole reason as to extend hate to other users of site we share.  An incredibly huge douche move for you that reflects on your true character, and I am ashamed you are a 4 year user.
Why not go over to the sub-reddits of other religions and tell them they are fucking stupid?
Why not go over to the sub-reddit gatherings of people of different descent than you and call them fucking stupid?
Why not just call all people of a different gender than you fucking stupid?
Seems to me like the person who doesn't open their mind to other possibilities is truly "fucking stupid".

bitcoin wallet app?????
Just secure your wallet on your own system for now is my recommendation.
If you are really paranoid throw Linux on a second laptop and transfer your coins to that regularly and encrypt, while making a backup on a USB stick that you keep at home/safe.

@_date: 2011-09-01 22:26:41
How long have you been mining?
@_date: 2011-08-20 15:02:53
Well, I have been mining since June 3rd @ 909Mhash/s, with an investment of $360.00. (3x5830)
I have sold back now $200.00 on Dwolla, and received it in my bank account, and I am currently have ~28 coins in my wallet and between my hopping pools.
If I were to sell all my coins today I would made all my money back plus ~100.00 and that includes the cost of running electricity I measured out with my [Kill-a-watt]( meter.
Yes, I pool hop, and donate at every place I hop.
So if you want to get into BTC, you decide if you want a hot computer with a fan running out it (24/7) to possibly make your money back, or you purchase coins and trade/hold on to and hope they go up.
It's all risky no doubt, but so damn fun!  Just a new hobby is all.

That does nothing and they still track it.  So say 2 hops later it is at a gambling site.  Then a month later you buy $50, send it to a random new address, then another, and finally the gambling site.  
Now coinbase has multiple instances of you sending your BTC from them to a random address, then it ending up in a gambling site.
There is software that tracks all this for them.  Now they have a pattern of it going to you and x amount even 10 hops and it still ends up at a gambling site.  They will close your account.

Looking at Ripple is the worst possible argument you can have about why the hashing power is useless.

If you are in US and want cash quickly use coinbase.  No question.
Anywhere you do go you will need to be verified in one form or another with your bank account information.
I have used coinbase over 30 times, all great.
Also I want to add since you really haven't done a lot of research yet, there are a shitload of ways to spend the BTC right now if that is an option to you that you may not have known about when you got the coins originally, assuming you didn't steal them.      is one of them but there are ways to buy anything you want with BTC if you do it right.

yea, but you paid your price in bitcoins up to 6 months ago.   So instead if you held on to your bitcoins you would already be up 400% instead of just pissing them away.  
Also, if you paid in bitcoins 6 months ago and asked for a refund now, you would only get 1/5th of your actual refund because they send the $ amount, not the BTC amount.

What legality is required?   I got a bullshit response from their PR team stating that they require picture ID due to the "Know Your Customer", but they lied to me because that is complete bullshit.
Gox isn't even registered as a financial institute that would require due diligence to be established before an account is created.
Not only that, KYC doesn't require picture ID.
I am fucking pissed about Gox, and bitinstant has just magically been down ever since people have told me about it.
I think you need to talk to a finance lawyer before you spout this information and get 100% upvotes, because people actually believe you for some reason.

I looked at every single one and the only decent one was the CampBX, but they too required a picture ID to use Dwolla (which I already have my $150 in).
None of the others even come close to helping me get bitcoins in an easy manner.
Bitfloor requires me to open a whole new bank account, bitinstant no joke went down when I was actually trying to use it and is still down right now, 
It is all just a joke on how much bullshit you have to go through to get these bitcoins.
Actually I just tried again with bitinstant and when i select Dwolla, and my Mtgox account and hit "accept" to transfer the funds I get a nice page saying "Pay for Your Bitcoins in Under an Hour

if you ever read the KYC, it does NOT require a picture ID, and SSN.  And it is more than questionable that these unknown entities are demanding that you provide them that information.
Especially since I have already had my bank account linked and verified for 2+ years.  
They did NOT REQUIRE any photo ID or SSN to take the money out of my account and move it in to Dwollas hands.  Now I am stuck with $150 in limbo with my Dwolla account that I can not move unless I provide my SSN (on top of my already submit and verified picture ID and bank account information).

The anonymous part is no concern of mine at all!  I think the concept and idea of btc is amazing, but the practicality of obtaining them is a horrible deterant.
So you are saying that everytime I want to get more of these, I need to really really work hard and get them.  Aside from that, I am paying a huge premium, and there is also not a single coin listed within 40 miles of Detroit.
So the process will not get easier if only a handful of people are actually selling coins, and the userbase will drop off the radar once the people like me, who have been using bitcoins for two years, coins run out.  Because I do system programming and analysis for the Army and Department of Defense.  If a user with technical knowledge far above the average user is unable to obtain coins, no one else will.
I have already gone through hundreds of coins (maybe near a thousand) that I mined myself, and once those are gone I am done because fuck the process of obtaining these (in America) because I will NOT give these unknown entities my SSN, picture ID, bank statement, bank account, and utility bill.
Fuck that,

You can make as many addresses as you want either in client but I am a big fan of blockchain.info, and when you hit "send" on coinbase you paste in whatever address you want to send the coins to.
But the coins you buy will just be in your coinbase account, you need to send them wherever you want.

Coinbase is not an exchange in the manner that you can store cash on it and trade at will.

It's not like the shares value goes to 0 BTC after you buy it.  You get the dividends and you can sell the stock back when you want at going market rate.  The price of stock may go above what you bought it so you get the dividends plus the increased yield price.
I don't think any company in the world has had an equivalent IPO going from ~$350k to $100M in  less than a year.

Not only that, I applied for my verification on the 22nd of December, and just got notified today that since I had my thumb over my drivers license picture they would not accept it.  How does that not seems like a horrible situation waiting to happen?
Did you provide your Photo ID, SSN, utility bill to paypal when you got an account?  What about any of the millions of credit card offeres that you just come right to your door in the mail?  They never once ask for a photo ID.
Thanks for the reply though, I guess after 2 years and all that mining I am done with bitcoins since this really is where I draw the line.  As someone with a CS degree who works as a network analysts I am giving up on bitcoins because of the sketchy process involved with obtaining them outside of mining.  I am going to sell my 25 bitcoins on Gox and get out instead of actually hoping to obtain more and use them.
Fuck bitcoins if this is the process.

Did or did not Gox provide the full details of the hack including details of how the hack was performed and how they made changes in the future to avoid any situation like it.  Not only that, did they or did they not reimburse in full all lost coins?
Hint, they did.
On the other hand, Bitfloor CLAIMED they were hacked, when asked countless times to release any details on the hack Bitfloor never addressed any details whatsoever.  On top of that, they did NOT repay any of the 24,000 coins, not 25,000 as initially stated.
I am not the biggest Gox supporter, but when they got fucked, they did not fuck their customers.
On the other hand Bitfloor was run by a known scammer, and HE fucked his customers whom gladly took it in the ass, twice now.
