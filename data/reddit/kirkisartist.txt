We're fucked if we do that now, so let's avoid that. But it's still on the table nonetheless. Let's just hope the futures traders would rather not burn the market just to fill a stupid gap.

believe me, we'll go a lot lower if we hit 3k again and we may never see another ATH.

@_date: 2019-07-04 01:19:57
yeah, it invalidates the falling wedge I was trading. But filling in the top gap at 12k now means filling in the 8.5k gap would be bearish AF. 
Not gonna fomo back in. Just gonna wait for a new pattern to develop and draft a new plan.

I remember when I first heard about bitcoin, the guy was like "after all these years it's finally happening!"
I literally had no idea it was something that anybody ever wanted. The general concept made sense, but I didn't think it would work, because anything can be hacked. Happy to be wrong.

As much as I like to buy low and sell high, I'm more comfortable when I sell high and buy higher.
I don't like seeing the trend shift downwards.

Smart contracts have to outperform government, like the automobile outperformed the horse. Payroll, book keeping and insurance will be automated, without a central institution. Auditing and arbitration will be autonomous. 
If you don't think the left will ever hop on board, just use these two magic words "workplace democracy". Bitcoin is worker self managed. It is truly socialist in the classical sense. What people choose to do with it tends to be capitalist.

I agree. Our monetary system is simple to explain, but it'll always be a controversial subject. The dismal science of economics gets absurd when anybody believes there's one economic structure that's objectively suitable for everybody.
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:11:59
That's a bit unfair. We thrive under a division of labor. If you specialize in say electrical repair, you may be tied up learning how to master your craft without getting electrocuted. The rest of your free time is reserved for raising your kids to be decent people.
That's why most people are 'dumb'. They have to trust how money works, just like how we don't need to learn exactly how electricity works.
Besides, normies aren't going to defer their expertise to fringe anarchists for economic theory. They're going to defer their expertise to the banksters that already control the economy.

From my understanding, it was initially a Templar meme from the crusades, where you could spend bank notes in Europe, but if push came to shove, you'd have to journey all the way to Jerusalem to collect the physical gold. It's easier to just accept that money can be in two places at once than to journey through hell and back to collect.
Same thing happened with the gold rush in the states. You deposit your gold in the bank for protection and interest rates, but if you wanted to settle out, you had to travel thousands of miles away to settle out. 
The entire point of running a reserve is to keep your money in 2 places at once. The "bitcoin standard" would only be sustainable if on chain transactions were too damn expensive to settle out. Which is certainly possible.

Thanks. Atomic swaps (forgot about it) within the lightning network sounds about right. I guess it would be up to Joseph Poon to connect Lightning and Plasma, since he authored both. Atomic swaps are just the key component to link the two. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:48:46
I'm not here to debate you about which ones are shit coins and which ones aren't. All I can say is that everything is way too underdeveloped for main street. I suppose wall street can spare the time and money on slow expensive transactions, but all they care about is dumping on main street.
Sometimes I have my doubts about any one network scaling to fit everybody on chain. When fees cost more than a cup of coffee, that means the network is at capacity. So I think it'll make sense to migrate from one currency to another from time to time. And if a new bug worries you, move your funds away from it.
And don't kid yourself about offchain scaling. There are trade offs that can't be ignored. Offchain scaling is great for fast and dirty transactions. But are as hazardous for value storage as keeping tokens on an exchange. 
But yeah, lightning swaps is the component I was forgetting. That should do the trick. As long as everybody settles out their tab responsibly. Joseph Poon has described state channels as a mattress for roommates to stuff their money under. At some point you'll want a neutral 3rd party with no money in the mattress to dish it out.

People are still lazy and I'm pretty sure exchanges as they stand are being abused. I don't imagine that if everybody pulled all of their coins off of any given exchange that would end with everybody getting their whole balance. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:50:54
Hhheyyy, good to know. I'll look further into it.


Exactly. Lightning should be great for spending and exchanging and cold storage would be for your savings. I'm pretty psyched about the cold storage phone that Huawei is working on.

No it doesn't lend your money out and print out the difference whenever the pyramid implodes.
Reminder, bitcoin is an *alternative* currency. Wish it could function in full velocity, so I wouldn't need a bank account, because I'm sick of feeding the ponzi and debt cucking the economy. It's a mistake I'd like to avoid repeating if I can help it. But it's not easy.
Currently, if you have to chose between selling your car or your bitcoin, you'd be a degenerate to sell your car. If bitcoin functioned like a currency, you wouldn't be stuck with that dilemma, because you could spend it.

I've been a reluctant nocoiner since consensus flopped, but today I bought .012345 BTC on coinbase, just to celebrate proof of keys. But it's saying I don't have enough to move it off the exchange into my wallet.
Maybe I've made a huge mistake.

Yeah, the conference. I was hoping for merchant adoption on lightning to be revealed or something.


Sorry to tell ya, but you're not out of the woods yet. I'm not a big blocker, but I am sympathetic towards the merchants that got burned last year. We'll be back when lightning is safe, reliable and user friendly. None of that ETF or BAKKT jive will revive BTC's promise as a p2p electronic cash.


Thanks. Never really went away, just playing the long game.

Fractional reserve banking was always a shell game. Plebs would lend their gold to a bank for a return on interest. You could technically withdraw all of your gold. But not practically.
If enough plebs tried to withdraw in the full amount at once, you'd get a bank note for your gold that you could retrieve on the other side of the continent. You could get on your horse, travel through bandit country and maybe a warzone, maybe lose a horse or family member along the way, just to get where the reserves were held. Or you can play along and spend the IOU, like every thing's fine.
After the industrial revolution, traveling across continents became faster, cheaper and easier, but feeding the ponzi became a bit more difficult. Every nation that had a gold backed currency failed in less than a century. America even started banning the possession of gold ingots and confiscating it to keep the scam going.
Thank god the sham finally came to an end. Sure, 1 GBP is worth chicken tenders on the kids menu, not a pound of sterling silver. But now that we can admit we have a problem, we can at least hedge with precious metals. Unfortunately precious metals can't be transmitted digitally. That's the one thing banks really made genuine progress with.
Bitcoin was invented to be a natively digital P2P currency without a trusted 3rd party. Great idea. 1 BTC=1 BTC, no ifs ands or buts. But if we go on a reserve standard 1 BTC=1 empty promise from a trusted 3rd party.
Bitcoin has succeeded as a store of value since the genesis block. The volatility makes it unreliable, but it has succeeded nonetheless. Until it's accepted as payment up and down production lines across several industries, it will be too volatile to be called sound money.
The easiest way to make bitcoin scale for the masses while keeping the back end decentralized would be to trust a 3rd party (bank or exchange) to handle the velocity. Transactions could even be free and instant. But the catch would be they'd use your money to inflate the supply and abuse the economy. Same way they did with gold.
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:26:10
I actually agree with just about everything you said. Just to add to your point, we have a long way to go until bitcoin can be called sound money.
Personally, I think bitcoin is still overvalued. Which is why I've been a "reluctant nocoiner" since I lowered my expectations. Until it can handle around a billion transactions a day, it'll be too volatile for a reliable SoV. 
But I had to represent for the satoshi run. I was actually hoping some exchanges would get flushed out yesterday and the market would tank as soon as I hit the buy button. I'm still pretty sure they're running fractional reserves.
Currently if anybody asks if cryptocurrency is a scam, I have to tell them that, if we fail into fractional reserves, then yes. And that's what worries me when I hear when somebody say settlement layer.
I'm still pretty optimistic, because you can't have this many brilliant minds working 24-7 on accomplishing absolutely nothing. Could take as long as the dotcom bubble to justify the 2017 hype, but it should be glorious nonetheless.
