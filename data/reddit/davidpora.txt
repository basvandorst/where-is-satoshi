Because Bithumb is known for their pump and dump (Bcash, Ripple etc).
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:32:39
It's SETHER for sure.

No need to do this. The best crypto will win.

I hate these bots. Saw quite a lot of them here. Roger, it doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:39:55
LN is like a bus. A lot of people can go from A to B with it. Imagine there are only buses on our streets, then traffic jams wouldn't exist anymore. You reach your destination much faster. Furthermore it costs you less than driving your own car. Apply this to current Bitcoin transactions and you'll see the brilliant idea behind LN.

Great news.

This needs more upvotes!

exchange maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:20:48
Move to PoS or other new method.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:54:24
No, their website is only displaying how the actual market looks like.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:43:49
The volume is going crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:51:03
The graph is pretty much like the one of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:39:21

Ofc you can, if the market cap will be big enough and volatility will be small.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:44:33
It will be without CME.

2008 Lehman Brothers
2018 Winklevoss Brothers
Just joking.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:57:48
Who else hears the sound ;D ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:14:42
If the guys from Wallstreet buy BTC, then these whales will be the fish.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:34:45
What about the fees?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:19
Four letters. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:09
This guy also can be obsessed with $ or €... He bets on football games, so he can use every currency to stimulate his addiction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:48:42
HODL. I heard that Bitcoin will reach Mars before the humans.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:44:12
It's Bitdegree.
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:19:36
yes. Why do people give him so much attention in this subreddit?
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:20:34
There are hundreds of fraudsters with their version of Bitcoin, but they don't get the attention from a group with 800k members. Ver's aim is to get this attention, nothing more. "Bad Publicity is better than no publicity".
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:54:27
Roger Ver already reserved all top level domains.
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:50:45
Your username fits in very well.
@_date: 2018-06-02 01:56:23
C'mon. Smartphone &amp; internet are known in almost every country, even the poorest, and the Penetration Rate is growing steadily. Bitcoin will be popular like that very soon. You need to feel optimistic about technological development.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:47:45
I hear this more often than my own name :D
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:08:18
Thanks. Is Bitfinex the best exchange for the fork (in the matter of speed) or should I move my BTC to an other exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:48:42
exactly my experience.
Just be patience and explain it all.
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:52:10
 Let's say your government looses the control on it's people or financial system. Which one would go to the moon?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:32:59
$85 K
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:18:02
Not related to that. Just normal swings.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:38:18
So what?
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:41:01
Do you even understand what layer 2 is?
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:41:10
You still don't know, what layer 2 is. The transactions will still be made in BTC, but there will be more small transactions, like paying a coffee through LN. The maximum amount of 21m still remains as it is. Educate yourself, it has nothing to do with FOMO. Just logic.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:39:06
Read the whitepaper. Do your research.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:55:45
The development is quite interesting. But I don't think China will go ahead. Chinese people invested 330 million in Bitcoin.

it's the truth. James Dimon is a liar.
