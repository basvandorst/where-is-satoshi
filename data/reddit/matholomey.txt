If miners won't ever turn off (or not turn on) their rigs then how would you explain the sudden -30% hashrate drop right before the next diff adjustment right before the next fork?
It looks like miners are tuning their rigs off to lower the diff on both chains before the fork. Also, in the last 3 months more hashpower has been added to bitcoin than in all years before together, it doesn't seem like an impossible task to add a lot of hashpower in a short period of time.

Yes of course. 
Velocity must be seen in the context of units of money spent. When the price goes up exponentially the units spent get smaller exponentially too. Bitcoins exponential growth in price is fucking up velocity completly, this pushed up the price - leading to more people buying and hoarding. Then repeat.
But there is nothing wrong with that. Nothing bad about everyone  having more money.
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:14:21
If money wouldn't be created out of nothing to counter the growth of its value it would become worth more anyway. If you have a growing economy thats constantly creating value and a finite amount of money suppy associated with that growing value things become worth more. its basic economics. Read the arguments why people think inflation is needed (hoarding etc).
The value that pushes bitcoin up goes to the holders and they profit. The value of the usd also goes up but the banks create so much money they eat all the profit.
We are stealing value from banks who were stealing from us for decades.
You are being fucked over and told bullshit reasons to think its ok
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:34:50
I can understand asking the users but I'm a software developer myself - I work to get a job done, most of the programmers I met are replacable except when they have control over huge parts of the code but thats a no-go anyway.
The only argument you gave me is that they made the client which makes up the vast majority of the nodes on the network. So what? I don't get why this makes you shocked - in the end I'm just a user who have never met anyone of them and I also have never seen any of their work. I also never ran a node.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:40:34


Yes, but just like you have shittier internet than me, somewhere, in some city, someone has shittier internet than you and you would not like to reduce blocks to 0.5 MB because of him, right? You would think there is some minimum investment and minimum internet connection speed that is required.
Now time has moved on a few years, the world has upgraded their internet but where you live nothing got upgraded and now you are in the same position as that 0.5 MB guy and, for example, I can't have 2MB blocks in bitcoin and will eventually end up with a less function version of bitcoin than it could be (high fees full blocks). So, seen from my perspective you would now be a negative geopolitical influence just like I would be one from your view.
Technology upgrades fast and I don't think if we can wait for everbody to upgrade. I mean there are people who are still using nokia phones from the 90s - should we go back to sms only communication because they can't afford a better phone? This doesn't make sense... The fork might come too early , I dont know when its the best time but it just have to happen and what do you do then if your internet is the same?

I would like to know why you think the core developers should have been at that meeting. To me it looks like we have people that make the network secure (the miners) and people who gives it value (the users and payment processors), the core developers seem to me like some of dudes who make wallets and argue about whats best for bitcoin but if this is the only thing they do then they are totally replacable by anyone who can program and knows the topic. 
What makes them so special?

@_date: 2017-09-16 20:44:49
hm ok I get that. Can someone spoof the network if he has control 51% of the nodes oder does he need 51% of the hasrate?
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:08:44
Thanks for that answer.


ok but what do they expect? It wouldn't have been like that forever anyway, they had to upgrade sooner or later - the problem is, maybe, telling the people that they can run a node on a RPI3. If I made a program and I tell my client it runs on a RPI3 and after some time it doesn't then I made false promises or bad guesses.


Oh I had forgotten to say that I heard about those super low speeds in a youtube video where the Core developers discussed 2x.


Well when you want to make money then maybe invest something? Especially when btc goes up like 50% in 2 Months and you get money for free? You think that $600 is a huge investment for a business? I understand it for very very small businesses, but having to pay 600$ to earn bitcoins? Isn't that like nothing?

I think its assumed that prices would be more stable at 1mil - a drop from 1mil to 500k is less likely than from 5k to 2.5k
this would increase usability
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:28:12
Yes the price might drop if someone sells 100k coins so what? 
Most of the time I need to pay someone I only use fiat when I need to. If I can use bitcoin instead I actually never need to cash out and the person using btc also doesnt need to do that. So its ok for money to only flow in as more people are accepting btc.

I saw this quote from satoshi in the bitcoin forums and would like to hear your opinion about that:
"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale [... ] The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms."
Btw I'm against 8mb blocks and I guess 2x maybe good because segwit gives more room for growth and bigger blocks are needed at some time. We can't wait for everyone around the world to upgrade their internet, your locational problem is YOUR problem and you are making it the problem of everyone else.
Mabe there just have to be a bitcoin for people who like to run their own nodes, even though the inventor of Bitcoin said they shouldn't, with shitty internet, and a bitcoin with a few fast nodes, bigger blocks and segwit that works for the masses.

@_date: 2017-09-16 21:50:16
Thanks for the long answer, I was just wondering who has the Control over whats in the blocks and, as you said, it's the miners because they create them and the nodes just confirm them. I was asking in that direction because I was wondering what happens when 90% of the hashrate leaves the network because of 2x. 
My guess was that maybe when 10% of all nodes leave the network (the miners) the remaining 90% non-mining nodes could attack the 2x network by spoofing transactions - but they can't, they have no power to hurt the network, they can only support it.
But the miners have that power - if 10% of the miners stay at the core chain and 90% leave it then on the core chain there will be a block about every 1.5 hours and readjustment will take about 100 days. This kills the chain. 
Also, if more than 11% of the 2x miners decide to fuck with the core chain they can do it. If 40% of them decide to override transactions on the core chain it will be doable for them and the nodes will jump on the longer chain.
It looks like the miners have massive power and the core chain has no chance to stay alive.
Good night :)

Why do you think that 1) everybody needs their own node and 2) nodes are there for reaching consesus vs this quote from satoshi:

I'm a computer scientist (B.Sc.) reading this sub every day I should be someone who switched first but:
1. I don't know that I should do it - I'm only reading about wallets "adding support for segwit" (whatever this means) thats all
2. I don't know what i should do or what segwit does or how to use it
3. It's still my money, It's hard for me to change software that turned out to be secure, like changing my wallet
In general the whole documentation about Lightning and Segwit and how the users should deal with it is missing. If I don't understand it how should my tech illiterate mom? A 10 sentence long tutorial or faq would be enough.

Better to have steady and secure 2%  inflation amirite?
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:34:40
Yes you're right. I'm assuming that more people will sell the higher the price gets and this will help spreading out the total units. Also, someone who needs 10 Million $ to buy something might probably still need 10 Million $ to buy it no matter how much coins he has and how much they are worth.

Why should its value decrease if people are buying stuff with bitcoin and the seller doesn't cash out?
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:53:29
I'm just saying that if the market cap is 60 billion and someone sold 20 Billion worth of coins then the market cap drops to 40 billion, about 33.33 %. If the market cap is 6000 billion and someone sold 20 Billion worth of coins then the market cap drops to 5980 billion, about 0.3333 %. This is what I mean when I say it's more stable when the price is higher.

@_date: 2017-09-16 18:32:34
I like your post but I would like to understand it better - why not just use a faster computer? It's not like a RPI3 can do much... Wouldn't it be better if everyone would use a faster computer and Internet connection? I kinda makes the problem go away. I get that it's more expensive but aren't we heading this way anyway?
I mean why do we need to downgrade bitcoin instead of upgrade the users. I can get an old PC for 200€ and an Internet flatrate with 50MB for 20€ / month.


I don't see why bitcoin is the problem, just as I said, internet cheap and fast as fuck where I live. I also don't understand why some rural living dude in australia who pays for each MB and has only shit computers needs to run a node.
Why is there a need that anybody must be able to run a node? I get that decentralisation is good but with my current setup at home I can run a node for years without upgrading anything and I'm also just some dude somewhere on the planet its not like running a node suddenly becomes a millionaire or corporation thing.

You have to change your mind setting. Only people who bought from DEC last year until FEB this year had made a loss and those just have to wait until its up again. It can take some time but that's the risk they are willing to take.
Normally you own money longer than a few moths. If you only spend money on Bitcoin that you don't need then it's not a problem to wait until it's worth more than when you bought it. When you're up enough you can pull out what you've put in.
