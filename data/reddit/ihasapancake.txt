All enthusiasm and happiness aside ... seeing the price climb from 195$ when I woke up, to 217$, where it's currently sitting at, scares the living hell out of me. This seems surreal.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:26:59
It shouldn't surprise that it's going down a bit, after such a hectic day.

A crash doesn't necessarily mean that the entire concept of Bitcoin is flawed. Sure, a crash could happen, it already happened before, but I (and many others) believe that it will survive and pick up again. Maybe it won't reach three digits ever again, but that's not the point. The point is that Bitcoin is being used by merchants, companies and individuals.

Would if I could ... 
"We are currently low on bitcoins. A temporary limit has been placed on orders. New Stock ETA 5:00 AM."

I'm supposed to be writing a boatload of papers. Word count: 13. Derp.

That's what a lot of people are doing, despite the almost disgusting sense of defaitisme that reigns over this subforum as of late. Then again, Sofort-banking seems to be broken, so there's not a whole lot us EU-types can do besides holding our positions.

Why? This was bound to happen. Bitcoin is in for the long haul. It will recover, and it will stabilize at one point or another. If you've got some BTC and you don't have too much money riding on this, then just hold on to them until you feel comfortable purchasing something or getting back in the game.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:30:14
why don't you use one of the many other exchanges?
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:53:27
Damn ... wondering if I should buy in now and hope for it to take off, or wait and hope it crashes again and then buy in.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:54:22
I'm in the EU, but I guess a lot of people use sites like bitfloor.com and bitcoin-24.com? 
Anyway, there are loads of sites:

Same here. Seemed like the only thing one could do at such a time.

As much as I'd like to earn money, what you just wrote saddens me. Are we seriously this invested in some quick bucks that you'd be 'really pissed' about having promised a friend a decent birthday present?

And it's a bank holiday where I live :'(

Damn it. I've been trying to buy some BTC through Sofort on Blockchain.info since friday, and it keeps telling me they've put a limit on their stock, so you can't buy any. This morning I tried again, when it sold for 147$, and I was able to get through but didn't buy anything in the hope it would go down a bit during the day :( 
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:37:13
It's gone down a bit since I posted that though. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:04:51
[Don't hate the speculators!](
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:51:51
I would if Blockchain.info brought back instant money transfer.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:57:34
You gotta hand it to them ol' geeks. They have a sense of humour. I'll be listening to that song all day now.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:43:31
It's also worth being on the lookout for blogs etc. that accept bitcoin donations. Tip some µBTC, save an artist/entrepreneur.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:06:36
GO GO GO GO
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:38:14
For this to kick off, the writers (or artists, inventors, musicians, ...) that are being tipped, should probably redistribute their tipped bitcoins to other content-producers. I like the idea of productive people being paid for what they do best, but equally interesting is bitcoins becoming a way through which we can motivate each other and improve solidarity between each other.

The OP of that e-mail has already admitted to it being a 'thought-experiment', though.
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:05:25
160$ is so 5 minutes ago. 161$ now.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:23:02
Bitfloor has it at "Last Price: $164.97". Welp. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:27:00
You can also buy BTC through blockchain.info, if you make a wallet there.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:33:30
and the use of BTC hopefully goes up... and up and up.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:34:26
Yesterday afternoon the price roughly matched the highest price friday had to offer, though. And since then it has only gone up, not down like you say.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:32:57
You mean ... something like [this?](

On the other hand:

Don't I know it. I'm afraid of even using the word "currency" or "virtual" around the house. When I tell my friends, they call me an idiot and generally sign off with a generic "have fun with your bubble" or whatnot.

according to their Twitter: 
"Maintenance Over however we are now under a DDoS attack."
Don't panic.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:33:47
Can't you simply buy some BTC somewhere else (with similar or lower fees) and then send it to your MtGox?
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:46:52
Is it important to have your account verified? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:32:08
I think this is a good idea. Heck, why shouldn't you try? There's basically no risk involved, and if it picks up, so much the better. If a) bitcoins become widely popular and acceptable to use as payment and b) I had some money converted into bitcoins, I can see myself tipping articles and inspiring people with small amounts of bitcoins. What I like about this idea is that it both pushes the writer to produce tip-worthy content, and to spread that theoretically "good" content to as many people as possible. I've been thinking about ways for large amounts of people to collectively help smart and enthusiastic people with their ideas/projects, and this would definitely be a decent step in the right direction.
