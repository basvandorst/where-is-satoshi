That's absolutely terrible advice. Lots of people regret having kids and hate being married. And this is specifically about whether they're a good nest egg strategy. Nothing you said actually addressed that. If people enjoyed having kids for other reasons, that's besides the point.

That is exactly what they do. And they also sell it. None of this is unique to facebook:

You don't need everyone to have kids to continue the species. Also, I haven't actually provided any advice so the first part of your comment makes no sense. You still can't seem to form a coherent response that addresses what I've said. But I know how well arguing with fools ends so I'll leave you to this conversation by yourself.

But how much do kids cost, are they really a good investment for retirement if you could have just invested that money elsewhere? Not to mention there is no guarantee as to how much your kids will help you. A lot of people live in different cities from their parents.

I don't blame her. In my mind this is going to play out pretty well but at the same time the use case and actual value of of bitcoin at any given moment is not very clear cut. The majority of people holding it are just holding it because they think it's going to go up. I think it's legitimate for people not to trust it. I don't try to change their minds because I don't want to be responsible for talking them into losing their money if I'm wrong.

Until now there mostly hasn't been though. There has been some adoption which introduces one of many variables but the problem is that speculation always exceeds the natural demand so it ends up following the dynamics of a typical bubble but cycling around halving schedules. The pattern could definitely break down but the theory itself is not wrong. Lots of people used this exact theory to make a lot of money during the last bubble as well plot their re-entry.

It's not about agreeing or disagreeing. It's the reason why. You don't seem to have much of a rebuttal to the arguments provided to you so I thought you may have changed your mind. If not, no big deal. But you may want to do a little more research on the topic.

Not to mention that the richer you are the more likely you are to be able to save a higher percentage of your income to generate interest on. Deflationary currency leads to exactly the opposite of what the OP is concluding.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:42:01
Also, it means the halving pattern is more likely to hold. I think the more people that know about it the more likely it is to break down.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:05:29
I disagree with your conclusion and I'm sure you can tell that most people do as well but I would like to say thanks for posting it. I think this is a good community discussion even if you original conclusion was incorrect. Have you since changed your mind on this?
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:51:00


No it doesn't. Rate of deflation depends on both demand and supply. It's technically possible for Bitcoin to experience inflation if GDP output decreases too fast.

I thought you were responding to my actual question which was have you changed your mind. Not caring about who disagrees with you is irrelevant to that question. There were a lot of good points brought up in opposition to your initial conclusion that I was hoping you had reflected upon. But if you were responding to the first half of my post then I see your point.
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:12:34


But you would actually need $227 to get you back to where you were because now the taxes are due that year. Spending and rebuying each year reduces your investment if you don't have the money to both pay taxes and rebuy the same amount of bitcoin that you just paid taxes on. The money that you are using to pay taxes is money that could have been the principal for tomorrows gains. You lose money this way.

It is overly simplistic because the Federal Reserve system is not private in the same way that Apple or any other company is private. The case you mentioned is a precedent within a specific context and not a definitive ruling. Someone tried to sue because they got hit by a truck owned by a local Federal Reserve bank. The term "Federal Agency" within the law that they tried to sue under does not fit the Federal Reserve, hence the ruling.


However, under other laws the Federal Reserve does meet the criteria of a Federal Instrumentality. Statements from the exact same case as your cherry picked example:






So, yes. Calling the federal reserve private and leaving it at that completely ignores the governments role in its purpose and long term operation, as well as precedents set under other laws in which it was successfully deemed a Federal Instrumentality.

Banks are not borrowing to stay solvent. They're borrowing to stay liquid.
@_date: 2019-09-21 04:22:10
Not really. See the example I gave earlier. Illiquidity issues can cause insolvency issues but you have options before that. The main option is to simply borrow against your assets. Have a job and a house but no cash to pay your debts? Instead of selling the house, use it as collateral to borrow against.

I'd say it's pretty difficult to acquire something you don't have enough money to buy.
@_date: 2019-09-21 02:54:58
 One means they don't have enough cash. The other means they don't have enough in total assets, including cash. If someone owes you $1000 dollars and they have no savings and no job, you're probably not getting your money because they're insolvent. If on the other hand they have a job and a $500,000 house but an empty checking account then they can still pay you your money... just not on time,  because they're illiquid.  One is much worse than the other. Calling a liquidity crisis a solvency crisis is incorrect and alarmist.

Never said they didn't. Before you ask if someone is "dum" I suggest you go learn to read.
"Alarmist - someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic."
Saying there is an insolvency crisis when there is a liquidity crisis is exaggerating the actual danger. So yes, it is incorrect and alarmist. By definition actually. Never said illiquidity wasn't a problem. Only that calling it insolvency is an exaggeration.

Hard: "characterized by or causing hardships or problems."
Would buying an entire coin at $5k cause people more hardships or problems than buying btc at 50k? Yes it would. Therefore it is harder. It is a pretty simple concept. Not sure why you seem to be so unwilling to comprehend it.

And I gave you three judgements that said the opposite. I've never argued that they are not private, only that calling them private is overly simplistic, while you claimed it is not. If you have one court judgement classifying the same entity as private in one instance while multiple other judgements classify it as a Federal Instrumentality, I would say at a minimum that means it's not a cut and dry answer.  Which is why any one judgement is not a definitive ruling but simply a judgement about its status under the context of one specific statute (of which there are many). I don't know how to make that more clear to you. You can go to one of the Federal Reserve banks own website to understand that it is not "simply" a private organization but is both public and private at the same time.

It's still a risk. Downsizing and gambling the cash is no different than if you had that money in your savings account and you spent it all on btc. It's cash that you had but no longer do. Hopefully it's money he can afford to lose.

I did read through your comment but unfortunately your other posts are lacking evidence for your insinuations just as much as this one is. The fact of the matter is that you gave an example to show the manipulation of market caps but you could only do so by first manipulating the the price to the point where it also becomes unreliable. You also can't seem to understand nor negate the fact that the market cap can actually be useful in the very example you gave, in which it becomes a signal of overvaluation. At this point I'm pretty sure there's no real conclusion to this conversation. I won't be responding after this. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:05:53


I've never argued that market cap can't be manipulated. I'm arguing that it is not a useless metric. It can definitely be manipulated but only as much as the price itself can be manipulated. In your own example you attempted to demonstrate manipulation of the market cap but your only means of doing so was by manipulating the price. Essentially you were "painting the tape" by intentionally buying and selling at inflated prices between you and a friend. At this point the price itself becomes unreliable. In my example, I'm saying that the market cap of your $1 dollar coin is indicative of overvaluation, whether it was through manipulation or other means. It's not the market cap that is useless. It's just a metric. It's the way that you employ the metric that becomes useless.

Market cap is not "bunk". Stop. Your example is silly. The only way to  game the market cap is to game the price so essentially what you're saying is that price is a meaningless metric. In your example you haven't just artificially inflated the market cap, you've artificially inflated the price. The only thing you have to ask yourself to know if a market cap is inflated is whether or not the average person could sell at those prices. Most likely no one would be able to sell it at that price in your example. So market cap can only be "bunk" where prices themselves are "bunk". 
And in the scenario you've made up it's still not "bunk" because it's just a metric. If someone wants to sell your shitcoin for 1$ the market cap would actually be a great metric to have because it may not be obvious to the buyer that the coin is not worth 1$ but it's damn sure obvious that it doesn't deserve a $100 trillion dollar market cap.  So the usefulness of market cap as a metric depends on what decision you are using it to support. Even if it is inflated it can still be a useful metric.
