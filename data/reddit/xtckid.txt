When everybody uses segwit (95% adoption) and lighting is deployed we can analyse if we need it or not.  For now the consesus is scale with segwit+LN ,   give it a go please.

If 1btc= 10.000$ (soon)
1 bit = 0.01$
If 1Btc = 1.000.000$ (around 2027 if there is a dollar/yen/euro collapse)
100 satoshi = 1bit = 1$
If 1btc =  100.000.000$ (never)
1 satoshi= 1$

The electrum app for android has hardfork detection and should display the 2 balances automatically (not sure 100%)
Just write your desktop seed once you install the app and hopefully i will show the 2 balances on agust 1st
If it doesnt work export the private keys.

Future mobile phones (10 years from now) with 5G and big SSDs will be able to run lighting nodes on the background without affecting the phone's performance or battery life much.
That would allow not only beeing able to send on lighting but also to be able to receive funds.
As for now it's not possible to receive payments unless you are running your own lighting node.
In 20 years we will all be running our mobile phone lighting node, but 1MB block is not enough for everyone to open/close a channel,at some point we will need to increase it.... I hope the best for us all but I will keep some BSV as plan B.
