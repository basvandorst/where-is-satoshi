In a fantasy world the global money supply is $10, all owned by A.  A lends B $10, then B lends that $10 to C. Global debt = $20 &gt; $10 = global money supply.

Don't you think [this]( shows a clearer picture than [this](  With the logscale, you can see that BTC has consistently run up by ~ an order of magnitude, and then pull back.

I meant that the change on the vertical axis shows your ROI.

I agree with you.  I was trying to say that I believe that people are more scared of seeing a loss of $500/BTC than $0.50 per BTC.

Constitutional protections are there to protect you ALL the time. If the state wants to convict you of the crime, they should be able to do so without trampling on your rights. If they can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you have committed the crime without violating your rights, then what justifies the state violating said rights?

You just don't understand how to read a logarithmic scale.

I'm not arguing that there is perfect correlation between the rate of EU QE and BTC price. BTC is traded primarily on dollars, so € going down -&gt; $ going up -&gt; BTC going down. But who knows what will actually happen?!?

Let's say you own 1 BTC valued at $1000.  If the price drops to $500, you've lost 50% of your holding in USD.  Now let's say you own 1000 BTC valued at $1 each (total of $1000).  If the price drops to $0.50, you've again lost 50% of your holding in USD.
In both cases, the price experienced a 50% drop and you lost 50% of your holdings in USD.  However, the first case is very "scary" (the price dropped $500/BTC), while the second case, considered today, isn't so "scary" (the price only dropped $0.50/BTC).
tl;dr: using a logarithmic scale shows your return on investment, which if you are a speculator is all that really matters.

With the EU starting QE, bitcoin should get stronger against the Euro.  USD stays strong so it will be a tougher market there.
Since the Mt. Gox crash, the USD index has gone up 25%.  While this doesn't come close to the ~80% loss in BTC vs USD we've seen since then, it does account for some of it.

If it was free how could they make a profit?

I asked. They said the fees are "about 10%", but "it varies."
