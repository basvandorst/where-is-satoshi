Don't have a doubt. In a bitcoin standard bankers and politicians won't rip you off anymore. Only the entrepreneurs that bring real value to people's lives will get richer. Imagine you find a solution for cancer or baldness in the shape of a pill. Well, be sure that people will be willing to give you some of their satoshis.

In the current inflationary system the rich keep getting richer because they outplay inflation by investing in stocks, bonds, etc., and the poor and the middle class mostly don't/can't, so they get poorer and poorer and money keeps flowing to the top.
In a bitcoin standard the rich and the poor people will also work and save money, without having to worry about inflation. Prices will tend to go down, so the more you save the more purchasing power you will have in the long run. The rich will not have the possibility to get richer unless they find a good investment opportunity.

In the current system saving money in the bank doesn't increase your purchasing power, the life gets more expensive (around 3% more expensive each year), while the interest the banks give you is less or much less than that. In the last weeks I read that European banks are thinking of charging and interest for just keeping your money. Even the interest of some bonds are negative! Summing up, in an inflationary system you lose around 2% or more of your purchasing power if you keep the money in your bank or under your bed. Rich people invest in bonds and stocks and they gain more than what the price of living increases (let's say they gain 5%, so overall they gain 2% each year). You NEED to invest unless you want to get poorer, and only the rich people do, because poor people don't have any money left to invest.
In a deflationary system you gain purchasing power just by saving because prices tend to go down, so just by keeping your bitcoin you gain, let's say, 0.5% each year. This works for both the poor and the rich. If you want to make more than that, you will have to take a much bigger risk.

To those wondering: the book is about how the Winklevoss twins became billionaires, and is written by the guy who wrote the book that inspired 'The Social Network'.
And The answer is yes, you should buy more bitcoin because in a couple of years the sequel (inspired by this book) is coming, and it will be as successful or more than 'The Social Network' and bitcoin will blow up once again.

We will still have problems in a bitcoin standard, but the system will be much better. One example is real state. Rich people (and also the middle class) invest in real state because there is a big demand and house prices tend to go up over time, specially in crowded cities such as NYC. If you buy a house as an investment and don't rent it, you make the prices go up. Having empty houses in a crowded city for the sake of making money is stupid, but it's a way of not losing purchasing power.
In a bitcoin standard it's a lot safer to save your bitcoin in your wallet instead of investing in real state. Bear in mind that in a deflationary system prices tend to go down, and this includes real state. Why would you buy a second house (or even a first!) instead of saving your bitcoin? The house needs maintenance, and the price will tend to go down unless your city is growing every year and there are not enough houses for people to live. And considering that people will travel a lot more in the future, it wouldn't make any sense to invest in real state.

I will only reply your comment once. You are incredibly ignorant and you have no idea of how things work. The point of bitcoin, the one you are missing showing how brainwashed you are by the current system, is that nobody should be forced to invest their own money. What if I don't want to let the banks invest MY MONEY in their dodgy investments? Who is the one who agrees with the rest of the flock? bitcoiners? or you following the flawed system like a sheep? With Bitcoin, you could put your satoshis in a shoebox and win purchasing power, while in the current inflationary system, according to your link:
 "if someone had a bunch of cash in 1959 and literally put it in a shoebox, they'd have lost a lot of money over the last several decades." 
But you are so ignorant that you don't know how a capitalist deflationary system works. The great inventions of the industrial revolution occurred under the gold standard, genius.

Explain why do you think I don't know about economics and government.


Destroying? Bitcoin is fixing. What is destroying society is inflationary systems and corrupt &amp; inneficient governments.


Inside the law and regulation of which country? I would argue it was designed to operate either inside or outside the laws and regulations. Bitcoin is just a decentralized ledger, doesn't give a fuck about laws and regulations. It just works.


You are contradicting yourself. You said it was designed by a libertarian and that bitcoin is a republic. Now you are saying it's not anarchist and/or anonymous. Many libertarians are anarcho-capitalists who believe in a republic, and bitcoin would be the pseudonymous ledger in such economy. Bitcoin it's kind of anarchist and pseudonymous for now, but at one point it will be anonymous.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:14:01

Jeff Schumacher: "I do believe it will go to zero. I think it's a great technology but I don't believe it's a currency. It's not based on anything. If it became the standard currency, because of the proof of work model that it sits on, if it gets to what we call the gold standard back in the 70s, the dollar was pegged against the gold standard, if bitcoin is pegged against the gold standard, which is around 7 trillionish dollars, if will be responsible for 20% of the world's CO2 production. So just by that alone tells you it's not going to be the go forward thing, at least for my view"
