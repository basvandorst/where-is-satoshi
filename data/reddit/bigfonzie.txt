Will anybody here be going to the Bitcoin Foundation conference May 14 - 17 in Amsterdam? - Guest Speakers include Gavin Andresen, Bobby Lee &amp; Patrick M. Byrne CEO of Overstock.com. Which to me looks like a Who's Who of the bitcoin world. I'll be flying in from England on the 13th to attend this event, will any other fellow redditor's be attending? It would be great to have a meet-up with a few of you there.

I feel PETA mine is one of the big players, they have a good business model, of an always expanding hash rate. I feel the dividend's pay well. So I shall be buying some more shares when the price establishes itself abit.

Ill be in Amsterdam from Wed 14th - Monday 19th. The conference will be the biggest of the year, cannot wait. You can still get 75% off tickets if you register with a Student email address. Would be great to see more of you there. Or have a Reddit meetup somewhere nearby. PEACE

Yes it costs quite a bit for the 3 days. But its 75% discount for students. If u have a university email account, or a friend does. Maybe try that? Amsterdam will be an important part in the bitcoin future.

Oh it will, if anything this is the largest bitcoin conference of the year. The Dutch ability for Trade, Freedom and Openness, as well as the jaunty quirky, practical nature of the people make Holland and bitcoin the perfect match together I feel :-) , Who will step up, and take this opportunity to make the utility of bitcoin accessible for the masses?

Hopefully, by next week they should start allowing registrations to go through.

Do you feel PETA mine is a good investment, considering the price keeps on going down?
