The futures are already out dumb ass

As someone who trades options and futures, no I didn't; clearly, any wave that would be made by the release of Bitcoin futures would have happened already when the first exchange lists them genius

But either way you'd just break even wouldn't you? You'd either lose 10% on a hedge you didn't need or you'd make money on that hedge but lose roughly the same on your portfolio right?

You must have nuts of steel and an endless bank account to short Bitcoin at 10x leverage my friend. That's some wsb material right there

If you can't do that math maybe you shouldn't be buying Bitcoin..

I agree, there's two groups of Chinese investors: 
1. Those who took their funds out as soon as the announcement that exchanges would close was made. 
2. Those who are going to wait until the last possible second.
We've just had the dip caused by group 1 but as soon as at least some percentage of group 2 sells for fiat (as opposed to removing from the exchange to store in a hardware wallet)  we're going to see another dip.

Easily if done right, but it's also pretty risky.
