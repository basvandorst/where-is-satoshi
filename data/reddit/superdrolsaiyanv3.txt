No one said that, and you’re looking at it from only one perspective.

High teens. I’m not knocking the decision to invest in BTC, I have a stake in it too, same for ETH and LTC. I’m knocking the blatant disregard for any shred of diversification. It’s mindless insanity for anyone with a significant net worth tied up in BTC.

Thank you for the reply. So what I keep wondering is...why not just keep the encrypted seed in a fireproof safe bolted to cement yadda yadda??? 
If anyone or anything is getting in, the hardware wallet is doomed regardless so why not stick with laminated encrypted seed, etc?
Will it all make sense if I just buy a dang hardware wallet already?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:17:26
do you even diversify bro? No I’m not talking about silly crypto-trading portfolios. Going all in with bitcoin is the same as going all in with just one stock. Both are retarded strategies. But owning a slice of 500,1000, 2000+ companies is a fucking helluva lot better in terms of risk for those who aren’t little snotty crypto-zealot kids

Fair enough. I’m not exactly sure what we are debating anymore but we are on the same side about most issues apparently. 
  I just put $250 today into each BTC, ETH, and LTC because I truly believe in it.
   I also mine ETH not for shits and giggles but because I believe in it, even though it’s likely costing me more electricity than the current return. 
  Also I updated some of my books lately and as of now I have returned about 25% on my capital including crypto. Crypto accounts for only a few percent due to its small allocation at this time.

Wat.   At least admit your stealing organizational resources
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:17
I got the feeling very quickly that the majority of this sub gives two shits about diversification, based off the responses. “But look how much it’s grown in he last few months!”
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:04:51
Um, there is guidance from the IRS...
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:03:30
Still, people asking for money for no logical reason is absolutely absurd and very uncommon, OP has freakishly bizarre friends/coworkers
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:44:00
Yeah no, that’s not how banks utilize interest rates. Take an economics class.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:16:18
It’s not talking shit, it’s trying to bring some sense back into the hysterics. Trust me, I believe in it too and invest in BTC as well, but it’s absolutely  ridiculous how people are losing their minds and throwing diversification completely out the window
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:48:27
Anyone care to share what allocation they devote to crypto in their portfolio? Obviously a lot of folks are all in, but would like to see some sentiments from others who are more conservative with this emerging technology and balance the risk with traditional financial instruments. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:15:47
Yeah right now, sure. Let us know how everything pans out by the time you are 65. Are you so sure everything will be dandy? Or only sort of sure? Maybe? Don’t know? No fucking clue? This is what diversification is all about, and you are not diversified at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:11:26
No thanks I like my liver and portfolio in good shape haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:08:03
The current financial system works fine for many, it has been for me for quite awhile. Crypto is still very new and very uncertain. A lot of us who aren’t single kids just playing with a few thousand bucks and need a bit more diversification than something between all in and “just put half in” when we are looking 30-35+ years into the future in terms of risk management. I’ll stick with my 10% allocation to crypto for now.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:17:34
If you have such a “deep understanding”, then why are you trying to describe interest rates and normal operational fees in the same context? Interest rates are determined by entities outside of the bank, and used to slow down or spice up the economy. Everything else is just normal operations. If you don’t like the fees or rates, find another lender with your credit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:10:36
Ah yes, Homo sapiens. What a flawed species we are, unfortunately
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:07:31
You sound like a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:40
That’s really easy for some people to say and do, but not everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:38:31
Wow. what a long dramatic write up to tell everyone what everyone already knows lol. Leave day trading to algorithms.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:00:39
Hey now, I still primarily invest in mutual funds. Only $100-150 a month in BTC....rest goes to SP500 index, would be insane to go all in with BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:42
This. I am 80% equities, %10 bonds, %10 crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:19:32
Gotcha, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:33:27
This is exactly why I only buy small amounts of BTC alongside my regular index fund retirement investments, the last sentence nails it right on the head.

You have beef with capitalism, not financial instruments. 
  Do you have any clue how they work? Any average joe can sign up for a brokerage account in minutes and put his money into the market grow it according to their risk tolerance. 
  If average joe has a family and wants to keep his kid’s college savings safe before they go to school in a couple years, bitcoin is not the fucking answer to everything.
   If average joe is about to retire in a few years and needs to keep his life savings safe and stable, bitcoin is not the fucking answer.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:31:17
Idk, can we use your lens of the future? of which you apparently have access to
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:45:29
Yeah if you find out please reply, was wondering the same too
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:44:36
Isn’t a hardware wallet just as good as a secured paper wallet anyways? 
Because if you have to maintain the passphrase of 12 words or whatever, and if you lose it, your hardware wallet is locked forever anyways????
 I’m not understanding how you could have a hardware wallet without having to maintain the security of 12 words somehow???
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:14:00
And how do you know it won’t crash to zero?
