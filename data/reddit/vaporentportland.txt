Thanks! Sent from GDAX 18 minutes ago (I forgot what I paid in mining fee, I think the lowest) and still not seeing a "pending" transaction in Mycelium. Should I be worried?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:02:00
Thanks! I'm not entirely sure where to start, though. Also, do I lose that little bit in the initial transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:38:33
Appreciate the advice, although no one has answered my question.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:34:38
Love this concept. What about capital gains and all that though with using the hot wallet for spending?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:16:19
Even though it has appreciated since injecting principal and is thus partially made up of that interest?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:47
What's the best way to set this up "conservatively?"
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:12:45
Also, I just transferred some BTC to Mycelium. How long should this take? It's been 5 minutes, not showing up. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:52:03
Totally disagree. Please discuss.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:30:05
Still nothing! I'm assuming that if I got the address wrong, the BTC would still be in my GDAX account? Is there a way to confirm that the transaction actually has been completed?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:30:45
Downvote it to hell, but if the general mindset around here is that investing in BTC is not far off from buying a lottery ticket, I think it's a fair question and would like to see what folks think about which could potentially turn a quicker short-term gain, providing one is knowledgeable about the principles of each.

This is helpful stuff. Do you all feel the same way about other cryptos, or just BTC specifically?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:22:47
Going forward, Can I deposit all cryptos straight from GDAX to my Ledger or do I need to transfer from GDAX to Mycelium? If not the later, do I have a need any longer for Mycelium at all?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:02:15
Checked it out and bc.info confirmed it hasn't been sent yet! I guess I'll just wait it out? It's certaininly showing up in both Coinbase and GDAX as a transfer.

You're buying multiple $70+ hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:42:11
This is exactly the well thought-out answer I was looking for. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:21:43
Got it :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:37
So hardware wallets are essentially reserved for those who are holding with bitcoin for many years and selling when they're ready as opposed to waiting to anticipate a crash/short the currency?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:19
For example, I've got 1K in there right now. Should I be building upon this?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:25
Also, this advice goes against what I've read about not wanting to host more than $1k in an exchange due to the risk of hacking/theft etc.

I tried his phone pin (which I guessed, his birthdate; also sums the guy up in such a great way) but no dice. It then asked me for the 14-word key. I'll be going out there in about a month and REALLY hope I can find it, but I'm wondering if there's an option if that comes up short. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:00:56
My concern with not doing anything at all would be that the coins would eventually get lost in the ether, which would fully go against his wishes. By small amount I'm talking like ~$2k as opposed to 20 bucks, so it could become significant in time. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:19:13
I'm pretty sure when I tried to and guessed it wrong, it removed his wallet entirely from Bread! How can I get it back and try again?
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:07:28
No, that's a nice idea, actually! I didn't even think about doing some sort of crypto memorial piece; it kinda speaks for who he was in a lot of ways.

Real funny, asshole.
