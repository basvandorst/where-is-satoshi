Got kicked from Bitfinex, good exchange, bad reports, and apparently fraudulent un-auditable USDT.

They are definitely aware that they fk up.  The goal is to be right the majority of the time.

Dude, you could be worth a solid 50 million.  Just wait it out if you have the ability to do so.  maybe sell 10-20 of them if you are concerned.

They are probably smart enough and understand they need to harness and empower and figure out a way to tax it effectively rather than try to kill it.  That would only be suicide and that’s not a good strategy.

Well drugs don't have the potential to totally change a global economy.  Crypto does not detract from productivity, and will be a major source of revenue and innovation in the next 50 years.  Like I said, they can make it illegal, but that would be the U.S. putting the nail in their own coffin.  Not smart - IMO won't happen or very low probability.
The mindset of incarcerating millions for non-violent drug offenses is starting to change.  People are realizing that it makes no sense.
