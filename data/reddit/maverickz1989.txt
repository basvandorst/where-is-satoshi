Cryptocurrency doesn't care about gender, so please keep that SJW bullshit far away from here. Everyone is free to invest, regardless of age, race or gender.

This isn't something that is related to parenthood, just plain human stubbornness. People are reluctant to change, and are mostly stupid/ignorant.

Market cap of BTC decreased by 10 billion and Market cap of BCH increased by a couple o' billion, so I guess that is correct.

I don't think 25% increase in 24 hours is something you call "dropping hard". So be careful who you call moron.

I'm no expert on bitcoin but I do know quite a bit about computers. Wouldn't the space/speed requirement of let's say 1024 MB be insignificant for computers in the future? Hypothetically, if we would double the blocksize every year (which is super fast) it would take 10 years to reach 1024 MB. 10 years ago we didn't even had smartphones, imagine what is possible in 2027.
I'm not trying to critique, I'm just trying to learn all I can so I can pick the right side when the moment is there.

I also value my internet provider more than a nurse, but those are just opinions of two persons. You don't get payed by perceived value, you get payed by responsibility and risks. Someone who is an *investment* banker (not all bankers work at Wall Street FYI), takes considerably more risks than someone caring for a couple of patients in a hospital. As you may have seen with the economic crisis, Wall Street can destroy the world in 1 day. 


Exactly. So how is that somehow the fault of men? Men take ALL jobs, they don't cherry pick. Men take the most dirtiest and most dangerous jobs in the world. If all women just take jobs in a couple of fields, you will have an enormous oversupply of people in those jobs, which will drive down the pay. Therefor, I don't think you grasp the economics of the pay gap, you think of it way to simplistic.


TIL that nurses get paid way more than me: 
These jobs get paid pretty damn well, so I have no clue what you are talking about.


Length of education isn't the only factor in higher pay. The difficulty and intensity of the education does, also how much sought after those jobs are. A doctor obviously gets payed way more than a nurse, but I don't think I need to explain that.
A nurse isn't some sort of university study, most nurses have below bachelor education (atleast here in [The Netherlands]( and our health care is better than in the USA). Finishing a bachelor or masters in economics is way more difficult than finishing a nurse degree. 


So where is your argument? A feminist(male or female?) in the military is just anecdotal evidence, it doesn't prove anything. Everytime I bring up this argument no feminist is able to counter it, they just change the subject. 


Not it is not. It is a whataboutism if I used to counter one of your points, which I didn't. That's why it is a P.S. (Post Scriptum). If you read the text above it, you could've seen that I tried to say that women might not want to work dirty/heavy jobs. A recent study in the Netherlands showed that despite increased economic power and rights for women in the last 50 years, womens happiness has declined due to increase in work related stress. 
What I'm trying to say is that feminists try to hard for women to be like men.

Just another dinosaur babyboomer who thinks that if he understands digital fiat, that he also understands crypto. News old man: Your opinion is not relevant on this matter. 
[This is also the same grandpa who said Bitcoin was banned by the US in 2016](

Ehh, so?
So you let yourself be defined by your gender and age? Or are you a feminist who thinks crypto is some sort of men's club and it is the fault of the patriarchy?

**Answering your questions with my questions:**
* My uncle is a banker and he gets paid less than me, I'm an IT guy. Why do I get paid more? 
* What do you propose? Equal pay for all jobs? So a banker gets payed as much as a nurse?
* You want equality of outcome or equality of opportunity?
* Hypothetically, let's say there is a gender pay gap. Businesses like to make profit, employee costs is about 40% of all expenditures of a company. Why aren't they hiring **women only** if they are cheaper?
* Which job requires more experience and education, a banker or a nurse?
* Why do feminists only complain about high paying jobs. I haven't seen them complaining about equal pay or gender diversity in the steel, sewer, oil, car, or any other heavy duty industry. 
I don't know if you are a guy or a girl, but if I were you, I'd lay low with this feminism stuff. There are already a couple of countries in Europe listening to your demands. You will get drafted in the military and if you don't look out you or your daughters will need to work on oil dericks, crawl through sewers and lift scorching hot heavy steel beams. 50/50 representation. Great stuff, it's your funeral!
PS. [Men die by the bushes in these jobs!]( ;)

You sure like to point out that you are female.

I started with a small loan of a million dollars.
Joking aside, I started this weekend and I invested €50 to try some stuff out. Currently I have:
* Etherium
* Reddcoin(Is going great)
* Monero
* ZCash
* Ripple
My portfolio is now €58 euro's, not bad for a first try right? So how is your investment going? Any good alt coins I might invest in?
