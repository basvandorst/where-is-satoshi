Let's not get ahead of ourselves. The tax fraud investigations are for the authorities to conduct, not random people on reddit.
I understand that people might be inclined to be hostile towards this guy for lying out of his ass for personal gain, but I don't think it's right for people to rush to conclusions concerning matters most likely unrelated to the current events unfolding.

I'm mostly saying that you shouldn't get out your pitchfork and go on witch hunts, because those are usually more driven by emotions and the urgency of wanting to be "the first" revealing something.
You can talk about whatever you want, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to do so. You may hear of all the evidence against him, but never of his defence, and you sure as fuck will not stick around for the final verdict, so if he ends up being found to be innocent then he'll be in quite a tough spot considering all the speculation about him online. I'm not arguing specifics here, but principles.
It's just not something that's relevant to debunking his claims about being Satoshi. His public proof has been debunked.
**EDIT:** To emphasise, I'm no expert in Australian tax law and I haven't spent the time verifying the claims a post makes because quite frankly, I don't give enough of a shit, and I don't think any of the people who upvoted the post to give it exposure have done this either because they're probably browsing reddit on the shitter and found something outrageous that they upvoted. I know it's fun to play private investigator, but if I've learned anything over the past few years is that a lot of self-proclaimed experts on reddit are just pulling shit out of their ass and nobody has any stakes in the matter to bother investigating anything in a post.

**If** they are true, and **if** that redditor's hypothesis is true.
Again, I'd rather not be working off speculation at this point when it comes to declaring somebody a criminal. Yes, there is a lot of evidence that points towards this, but since we're on the Internet and not in court, there is no defence lawyer and the picture painted is going to be one-sided.

Yes yes, free speech is a great thing and censorship is bad, but there is a very real reason as to why libel laws exist: Not everyone's speech gets the same exposure, and the timing of statements is incredibly important when it comes to how many people you will reach. This is going to be the top story now, but it'll be an old hat in a week's time, and people are less inclined to upvote anything about it.

The ongoing tax fraud case is not relevant as to whether the public claim of being Satoshi is real; it can and has been debunked separately, without any speculation as to his motivations.


In front of the law, he is currently innocent, as he has not been convicted of a crime yet. There is an ongoing case against him, but this does not mean you can claim he's a criminal right now.
