if you dont want to use bitcoin because of the fees, there are still much better alternatives than BCH. BCH is slow compared to some other alts. shop around for other alts depending on what you need. be that quick transactions, cheep transcations, price stability, anonymity etc. BCH is not the next best alt to bitcoin.

Well this a very narrow view of why we need privacy and security. They will likely want to fight for rights to warrantless universal surveillance on these grounds. But what they are doing is framing argument in a way which is easier to justify the intrusion into the privacy of innocent people.
When we hear these arguments we should remember that we use privacy and security to protect ourselves from cyber crime, hacking, fraud, extortion etc from criminals.  The majority of us are not hiding from law enforcement and to claim we are is completely disingenuous.

I wouldnt accept an international payment without charging extra for wire and exchange. The point of "whats in it for the consumer" is what merchants can offer them for using btc. Merchants can operate much more freely with btc and can pass these benefits on to consumers. there is no require to use btc but it is an option. If you only purchase bread and milk from your local store btc is a bit irrelevant, use the local currency you have in your pocket. If you're purchasing used goods on ebay paypal offers a level of buyer protection that makes good sense. But these are all options amd all these option have pros and cons depending on use case

even if the credit card is not stolen, the buyer can ring the credit card company and say "hey, someone used my card to make a purchase, i have no idea what this is, this is a fraudulent transaction. Someone has stolen my details and made this transaction"
Credit card company reverses the payment. 
I recently had the same issue with a buyer sending payment from his bank through to my bank. Either the bank account was hacked or the owner claimed it was and attempted to make a chargeback. however my bank sided with me and denied his bank access to my money.

2009 to 2014 is 6 years to you.. so I was out a year on bitcoins age but how many year has the dollae been around? You dont want correct me on that? My point is still unchanged by this correction. The dollar has many years and the use of violence and coercion to enforces its global status. Bitcoin is a voluntary mechanism of transfer of value.
You can easily  lose all your money if your careless and dont take some simple security measures. Your right  bitcoin doesnt protect you from your own  carelessness.
But as to bitcouns utility, no, i didnt mean any of those things. I meant i dont have to wait 3-5 days to recieve a payment. I dont have to pay between $10-40 to make that payment. my bank cannot confiscate my wealth or charge me extra fees at their whim. I can make payments without giving all of my personal information and keys to my wealth away. I can transact with anybody i like anywhere in the world and transfer payment  in under an hour at almost no cost.

they can do this and profit. they would not need to be losing money. Owning a mining pool such as ghash and some other large pools. they can make a profit while gradually take over the blockchain. 
However once they have control and their malicious behaviour is noticed people would leave the pool or hard fork the chain. there are numerous scenarios and possible solutions after that.

[My Disclaimer} I am an artist and only became interested in bitcoin technology through social activism. I come from a first world inner city culture. My maths is terrible and many people around me dont do maths in their heads. 
For me trying to calculate the real world price of something when it is priced in mBTC or Bits is too much trouble and I will tend to move on rather than struggle to do the maths. I used to love bitcoinity.org for its pricing charts since it changed to Mbtc's i cant use it. 
I appreciate that most people have good level of maths education but I hope that for the sake of inclusion for those all round the world who dont have an adequate level of education, some better solution is arrived at.

The price of gold rough average this month $1275

But it doesnt have it built in. Your thinking about the market. Your wanting the market to pay you more for your bitcoin than you bought it for. This is not coded into bitcoin. All the code does is say X exists at a given point and allows  owner ship of X to be transferred.  The market decides how much you pay for ownership of X or how much you will be paid when you want out of X. Getting more or less than your original input  is not a funcrion of bitcoin but a function of the market.

option a is highly unlikely unless more than 21 million bitcoins are created ino rder to meet the demand. your trying to sugggest that $21million dollars is enough currency to service a global payment system.
if Bitcoin is used as payment mechanism on a global scale then the cost of bitcoin has to be much higher. because the ammount of bitcoins in motion + the amount of bitcoins held by people who are using daily + plus the ammount of bitcoins held by exchanges for tading for profit  + traders and speculators trying to make profit = a lot more than $1 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:48:39
Agreed. It doesnt make sense to sell all mined coins every day. Selling only what is required each month to cover costs and holding for future price increases makes a lot more sense.

op states less interest since december. evidence is less visitors to reddit. maybe that is due to more trolls rather than declining interest in bitcoin. could be other reasons.

the only thing that stops this from happening is the bitcoin sellers not accepting credit cards. Anybody stupid enough to accept credit card (or any reversible form of payment) is going to get swiftly and duly rinsed.

Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.

Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon

How do you get fiat in and out of coinfloor? I tried to make a deposit and my bank wanted to charge me £9.50 on a £100 deposit. coinfloor say they will take £5 too. That would have been a near 15% take out of my deposit. do you have similar fees?

Traders need people to buy when the price is high and sell when the price is low. Fud encourages people to sell, hype encourages people to buy.

Have you noticed the price is going up? But the general thrust of your post is in the right direction. There are vested interests that want to suppress price. In order to suppress price they need people to sell. In order to encourage selling they fud, troll, brigade. This is supported and propagated by btc news outlets, businesses and even some devs. If you are concerned about price consider this. How much new money is required to purchase all newly created coins each day. That same amount of money will still be coming in after halving but there will be half the amount of btc for sale.

Btc is deflationary and its value will increase when demand for bitcoin is higher than supply. Profitability wasn't a designed feature of bitcoin.

4hr is on tradingview free version and poloniex charts. Tradingview free is often used on other exchanges. For both of these Its the longest candle before the 1 day candle. Its not the most reliable. You will see on the 4hr you often get double dips or double tops.  That's bad trades. If you view the charts on 6hr or 1 day you get less false signals.
The longer the candle the more reliable the trend.

i haven't stated it will continue to grow either, Only that volume will move from centralised to decentralised exchange mechanisms. 
ok in very simple terms.  
by volume I mean the amount of trading that takes place in a given period. 
decentralised exchange are the exhanges that run as p2p apps. eg.     
The decentralised exhanges, much like bitcoin or bittorrent can't be shut down, switched off or seized. They have very low volume of trading currently. 
Centralised exhcanges have an owner or company backing. they exist on a locatable server these entities .can be targeted by governments and hackers. They have the majority of trading volume currently.
my point in answer to the op, is, if governments ban exchanges, they cannot shut down or stop the decentralised p2p exchanges. ergo trading volume will increase on these p2p exchanges.
in the long run (who knows how long), this will be better for economic activity of humans who will be able to transact without having to establish trust with middle men or another party.  we would have trustless p2p transactions across multiple currencies and assets.

it is an average of all exchange data. If the coin is traded in btc and usd (eg. dash, monero, ltc) then the price will be inclusive of all the market data for that coin.
Edit: to answer you reason for asking the question. It shouldnt matter. If you want to get out of depreciating fiat then just get out of it. even when prices fall against btc they are usually over the long term increasing against fiat. however the prices are volatile across all currency pairs. if you wait for bitcoin to dip the alt might have increased against btc. (or not) if you want to convert fiat to alt to hold the alt. just do it now. Otherwise your getting into day trading strategies.

Ps. The goal of core should be to maintain those design elements which make bitcoin usable eg. Fungible, transferable, limited, trustless.

The uses of bitcoin arise out of it qualities. Core doesn't need to fit itself into a market.

One factor that is often overlooked is that during a recession/depression when banks reduce their lending there is less money/credit created via new loans.

I suggested something similar a couple of weeks ago on here. It was to add extra blocks as required but only the normal blocks would have the bitcoin reward. The extra blocks are rewarded by transaction fees. There is some research being done into this and it is a long way from being a solution. There were also technical problems identified with difficulty adjustments etc. The technical stuff was beyond my understanding. But I was convinced that better qualified people than me where working on these solutions.

Segwit was only activated recently and not too many people have switched or know how to switch to segwit addresses.
Here is some info:
According to  the cost per byte has been dropping and is currently very reasonable to comparable recent trends (imo).
according to  The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 0.0000027 BTC/byte, shown in green at the top. For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 0.0006102 BTC.

it is proposed as an upgrade but the majority of contibutors to the bitcoin core repository do not think it is a safe or required upgrade. so the fork is contentious with (afaik) only one developer writing the code for it.

there is no transaction problem. the transaction problems were fabricated. the mempool spam which created slow transactions and high fees stopped happening after the new york agreement.  
 says:
The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 120 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 27,120 satoshis.
Segwit provides more capacity than we currently need. Lightening network is going to increase this. 
There are plenty of blocks mined with out any transactions in. 
so why are we having segwit2x and another HF? its a coup:
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:35:09
No transactions are happening on bch. It isnt used. so it never elleivated any pressure from BTC network. The reason it fixed "the problem" was because we had mempool spam by entities that wanted to cause problems. they now have bch. is that good enough for them? no.
is there a problem with bitcoin transactions now? no! has segwit improved transaction speed? yes. and fees? yes. Will lightening further increase transaction speed? yes. and fees? yes. 
do we need to fix a problem that doesnt exist any more? no.
Has bitcoin core provided stable releases and security for the bitcoin code? yes. Is Jeff Garziks BTC1 code approved by Core? no. Do core devs think the BTC1 code is dangerous? yes. 
so why do we need segwit 2x through a dangerous and contentious hardfork? we dont. So why are we having  this fork? because some corporations like centralisation.

Bitcoin is much better, faster, adopted, than ever before. If you believe in all those things getting better, keep believing. It will happen. The price is hugely influenced by traders that are easily spooked by news. Even when the news is untrue traders will react expecting other people to react. The market itself moves in cycles which are quite easy to identify, larger cycles create bigger waves. We have just been through a huge upward trend and were completely overbought on all major indicators, a correction was due and at some point the trend will reverse again. Stop looking at the price. believe in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:35:58
yes. the mempool spam had been going on for a while. it provided the justification to the big blocks argument. in reality big blocks reduce decentralisation of mining and validating nodes. centralisation of mining and nodes would more importantly mean centralisation of consensus. it would open the door to more control of protocol changes (in extreme cases even rewriting the history of the blokchain).
 
the mempool spam has now stopped.

Buyer beware
Quote 
"BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys, which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide to use. Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software. "

A fork shouldnt decrease the value of the original coin but for some reason people panic.
people seem to be moving btc from exchanges to their own private keys. a sensible move but this will result in less btc for sale on exchanges.
So people who have panic sold and realise they should'nt have because there was no reason to, are going to start panic buying into a market with less liquidity.
