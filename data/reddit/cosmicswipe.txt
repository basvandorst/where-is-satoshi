Would be great if there were lootboxes. Boss fights are too short. Can tell you aren’t 16.

I’ve had a pretty rough weekend mate sorry for the delay. A loss in the family unfortunately. Give me week or so and I should be back to normal re my work schedule and I’ll jump on the repo.

I’m a mobile developer with a lot of experience, hit me up if you need some advice or have any questions. I’ve been a software engineer for over 10 years, if only I had been a hodler for the same length of time!
Good luck and have fun :)

Sure I’ll do this. I’m based in the UK though so we might be slightly out of sync. I will make a new github account for this as I’d prefer to keep my day to day account off Reddit :)

I'm sure you've been inundated with responses similar to this, but if you're interesting in collaboration, PM me. I'm working on my own projects (not crypto related) at the moment and would most certainly be interested in putting my expertise to good use in the bitcoin space.

An amazing thing you are doing, I am sure you will help a lot of people and get a lot of satisfaction from doing it.
There are many worthwhile causes already mentioned but if I had to vote it would be a very general one; medical research.
The amount of cringe in this thread is probably as expected. Many people are subtly asking for your bitcoin through their stories of unverifiable misery - please don't fall for it. It's a slippery slope.
I do apologise to anybody who is being sincere and has no intent to beg, as there are some very tragic events mentioned here - but in a thread like this it does come across as 'beggy'.

Cause I’ve been hodling and hodling so long that, even thinks my mind has gone

Came here to see HODL.
Left happy.
