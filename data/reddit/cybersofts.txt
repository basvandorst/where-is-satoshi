We want the bitcoin payment option to be on the reddit premium upgrade page.

Looks great! but why not on the Reddit premium page? very few people know this.

it's looking healthy indeed!

I don't like seeing PayPal as a payment option without putting bitcoin too more especially on an online community full of nerds such as the old and mighty reddit! Come on guys, it doesn't make any sense ;)

I never bought one before, I just want the experience. Maybe I'll learn more new things. :)

Indeed, no doubt about that. Bitcoin is the most successful investment of this decade.
