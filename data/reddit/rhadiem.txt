Tell me when BTC hits 19,000...

an actual interview is about as un-fud as you can be.  This guy is real, this happened.

You'll say the same thing when it breaks $1000 again.

Skittish owners, MtGox being a mess, and the DDoS attack helped stir up uncertainty.  In a couple days it should be back up to what it was earlier this week, and more people will see Bitcoin isn't as fragile as people have thought.
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:04:49
mind saying what you mine, and with what gear?  A buddy and I got out of a BFL 50x2 setup shortly after getting it and were getting nailed by the difficulty increases.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:07:25
If it ever hits 50, it'll probably hit 0 shortly after.  I don't ever see it hitting 50 again, only something bitcoin-breaking would cause that.

Can you buy gift cards with gift cards?
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:16:54
That's the most accurate but thoroughly unhelpful answer I've seen on reddit today.
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:42:13
have sunk?
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:38:43
I see bitcoin needs maturing to become recognized as valuable and trustworthy for large scale adoption.  Any time bitcoin weathers a storm and survives, it proves itself more and more as a mature system.  This is a long-term benefit which overcomes the short term losses you mention.
So, while I agree with you, I see it as a short-term answer.  Long term, any sign of maturity and durability in the public eye is a very good thing.  A DDoS isn't poison, it's a flesh wound.  Same with a flakey exchange.  They're minor issues in the durability of the system.
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:36:34
You seem to be ignoring all the merchants that are supporting bitcoin every week.  People need to see a stable currency that is not flawed and has a use for it.  We don't need more people with .01 btc, we need them to see it is not risky and is useful.  This requires maturity and merchant adoption -- which is what bitcoin is slowly proving and gaining.  Btc will be available when people want it, it will just be at a price that is more reflective of a mass adoption, not just something for day traders and speculators.
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:30:54
I am assuming that as long as bitcoin does not have a fatal flaw which breaks the reliability of the system, it will grow in value because it is useful.  The more "sky is falling" events that happen and fail to kill bitcoin, the more people will hear about it and see it is durable.
@_date: 2014-03-17 07:37:31
People are shaking off the whole RIP MtGox thing.  When they realize Bitcoin isn't dead and isn't going anywhere it will go back up again.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:42:53
LOL exactly.  Nothing new to see here.
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:16:44
Well, you could sell it and hope it goes down more, then re-buy more with the same money, giving you more than you had in BTC.  Or you can cash out and pay off debt or other useful uses of money, or you can hold it and hope it will recover.  I don't see cryptocurrencies dying though simply because of some regulation.  It's out of the bag and laws change.  As long as bitcoin still "works" and isn't broken, I see it recovering.

You could have sold all your bitcoin at 1,100 like me..

You cant blame people for wanting to get in something that was performing well to help improve their lives.  You can be willing to lose something and still feel it when the bottom drops out.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:29:34
I once thought this way about Mt. Gox.  Thankfully I was able do so unscathed.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:03:23
Hodlers every time.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:52:52
Yeah, my main question was how it would survive a fork/major change.  Apparently quite well.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:49:04
Raising price says I dont care ;)
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:27:56
Sold mine at 1200 or so thinking the big gains would taper off...
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:42:23
Yep crypto is pure gambling if you are poor, you nailed it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:40:42
btw my point was it was profitable advice, not disputing it was a fallacy.  I called it a fallacy in the original reply.  And yes it was a lighthearted post.  Cheers.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:31:20
Haha, I haven't heard that term in a long time.

I initially had it a zero casting cost, but the generator didn't show up anything so I did this.  I chose red because it's not explicitly "evil" but it's generally aggressive.  It would ideally make a 0 casting cost artifact.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:53:23
thanks, openbitcoinstore.com looks interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:55:50
Not when you lose them on a boat. ;) The protip is backups.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:12:13
yeah this is just silly.  Hopefully this will change soon.

I doubt he cares, neither do I, it's well earned.
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:24:24
I think this generally should say don't buy a miner today at all, unless you're very very very risk averse.  Still waiting on mine, trying to fight them for a refund on their now DOA product line.  I am not anti BFL but they're just terrible at estimating.  Don't pre-order anything anymore.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:55:12
I'm not sure I get it, how would that look?
@_date: 2013-06-13 06:09:58
Surely you realize real businesses don't use or condone profanity or use it for their public communications.  This isn't anything new.  It's simply respecting everyone.  If your professional experiences are different, it doesn't mean the majority follows suit.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:53:04
score!  Thanks.  Also the openbitcoinstore looks interesting too.                                  
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:56:58
I understand fees would be involved, but I don't go to a teller for my Paypal account or expect them to have a branch down the road from me.  It's more like this.  I think you're extending my request into a full blown nation-wide bank system, which isn't what I was asking for. :)
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:17:31
ok thanks
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:20:49
perhaps the fees are too high, or that a competitor owns it may affect things.  Or the owner of Ebay beat Bezos in a golf game.. who knows.  Coinbase and Amazon is a great idea
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:42:39
Heh, and I'm imagining the guy pointing his finger as the official over the fight.  Fight!

Isn't the Protip to back up your wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:03:51
aaah I see, you're talking about another card.  Well here's the generator I used, go to town :)  
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:20:16
It would help spread the use of bitcoins for small transactions for one thing.  How would it hurt?
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:49:18
it's like tipping in Yen, where the closest bank is miles away and eats up most of the value in transaction fees.

so basically you're doing what mtg sites have been doing for years with cash, only now with BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:15:05
Are there sites that I can set my price in dollars, and I'm paid in bitcoin? (the user uses credit card/etc)
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:16:44
Could someone explain when a good threshold is from going pooled to solo mining?

Revised version -

and yet, 6 days later the same link makes $5,600 in profit.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:14:28
So how does Paypal do this?  Are they considered a bank also?
What do you see as the shortest path to this kind of setup?  Paypal working with BTC?

@_date: 2013-05-05 21:54:50
what would you think would be enough?
@_date: 2013-09-14 02:56:11
The way to convince them is to show them how it is useful.
It's probably more an issue that your parents don't get a lot of stuff on the internet and still think their currency is backed by gold or something more "real".
@_date: 2013-05-02 09:20:48
in 2 months everyone is going to have ASIC's and difficulty will be through the roof.  Secondly, gpu mining is not worth investing in, or even perhaps doing depending on your setup.  In 2 months nobody will gpu mine unless they're running their computers already, or for free.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:50:59
I had one off kickstarter but sold it.  It's not a bad idea, just needs to be refined.  If it had an entirely bitcoin based app/game marketplace though, that would be pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:29:33
That's a slow ride to the moon.  Neil Armstrong only took 4 days. :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:58:17
I believe it's simply a red card that can use other mana types.  I think that's acceptable, but I'm likely violating some huge MTG nerd rules with it, like Alpha not allowing tap or multicolor mana use or something ;)
My frustration with paypal remains and I get to mock them a little so I'm ok with it.  I haven't played in a long time myself.  I just came across the generator while I was dealing with paypal so it was a product of that set of circumstances.
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:41:08
hopefully this'll be the beginning of a rise to new heights once people wake up and see how cheap coins are.

I see it as giving control of an individual's money back to the individual, nothing more.

They're horribly late, agreed.  But don't you think they either had a bunch of cancellations which increased the availability of excess chips, or simply ordered more after seeing others sell chips and decided it was an easy way to profit?  Yes, they're horrible at projecting attainable timeframes, but they do have product.  The question is if they can ship the backlog before all those loose chips make it into hashing gear.
