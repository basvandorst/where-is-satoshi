Yes, quickly show me your private keys and I can help and advise you.
Just don't tell people who can follow you home or hurt you. Some successful traders have been held hostage and forced to give their crypto. Drunken guys have been breaking into exchange's offices with bags to fill with crypto...(that actually sounds funny, just made it up) lots of  lowlives out there.

I use an app on my phone for all that (CoinMarket app). Jargon included, plus latest news on crypto. :)

Ok, but it did stop before the lower MA line. Then watched it move closer for adjusting the gap a bit later (as it did before). Then sh!t hit the fan.

I think it is broken. DId you see the growth spurt? It lasted about half an hour but got stuck at a resistance area... and was a waste of 'fund injection' from the 'crypto gods'. 
Cryptos are stuck maybe??? Since 3 and half hours now... 
I don't think we will see it moving till the support line thingy - (EMA 100 on 15 min chart) catches up to push it.... that is what helps it break through the resistance areas/lines. :((

How do we re-start the blockchain, it seems to be stuck.. 
I removed my millions to make room, but space does not seem to be the issue :P

@_date: 2019-06-26 10:29:22
Yes, but I can't stop staring at this shit!!!
