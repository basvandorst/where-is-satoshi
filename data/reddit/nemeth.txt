Oh hey guys, **THE FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA HERE**

List your sources then.

This article is bullshit.  Two-bit Idiot is squeezing you guys for every last bit of PR for his blog.  Any half decent journalism would have some decent sources and not just a 'two-bit' .PDF which makes no sense.
We are being starved for news on Gox and this guy is capitalising on your concerns.

Yes, but Bittorrent is about  **sharing** files.  You can make ∞ copies of that file and distribute it exponentially.  Bitcoin is different.  You cannot make a copy of it and that is why its as valuable as it is.  Once you have x amount of BTC, you hold a certain amount of control over it.  See my point?

Well so far for just under 3btc.  I get 0.00020939 every 6hours.
So one week would be  0.00020939 * 28 = 0.00586292
0.02345168 per month
0.30487184 per annum.
Thats just for BTC.  I know securities on btc-co that can't match that.  It's an interesting concept.  The shares look interesting too but the interest on deposits is a great feature.

But it eliminates the ordeal of confirming transactions, an argument of why Bitcoin won't work in the retail industry.  Instant processing allows it to compete with the likes of Visa and Mastercard

PLease see my[ comment]( This isn't really any big news other than eBay creating a new category to move all the crypto posts spamming up the coins section.

Ok I'm a bit late to this thread.  What does this mean exactly?  I bought and sold Bitcoin on eBay when I got into crypto initially.  I had to stop when scammers would buy my Bitcoin using hacked accounts.
I got some chargebacks which scared the life out of me.  I had sent the coins to the people yet I was being asked by eBay to refund the customer who had his account hacked.  As a seller this pissed me off something unreal.  I couldn't be held responsible for the fact that user didn't take enough precautions to secure their account.  What am I going to do, ask each buyer if they have been hacked, how would I know?
Anyways.  After talking to PayPal they assured me there would be no chargebacks.  This was from their indian callcenter who I didn't trust, they follow procedure and don't make their own judgements.  I then asked them to send it in writing via email.  They sent me I would not be charged 'fee's'.  He did mention that on the phone but I assured me I wouldn't have to pay back the buyer.  
Fast forward I get a chargeback.  Phone PayPal, eBay then escalate it.  I was told by a number of people to just accept it and pay the charges.  Lucky for me I had a nice lady who understood where I was coming from and under the goodwill new user, they refunded me.  I have not since used eBay to sell digital goods as it is way too risky.
My point is that Paypal do not cover digital goods under their buyer protection.  Until they do, you are at risk of being scammed buy buyers or sellers.  I am not surprised they have added a digital currency section as crypto is spamming up the coins section.  I fail to see how this is big news, until they protect the sellers, selling on ebay is asking for trouble

As I have some coins deposited there, I am obviously going to say yes.  For a less biased answer, I trust mcxnow as much as bct-co and btc-e. 
At the end of the day it is a risk.  It's risky, but then so are a lot of the exchanges.  There is better communication between the dev at mcxnow than the devs at btc-e which gives some reassurance.  I suggest you lurk in the trollbox there and ask Realsolid (the owner) any questions/doubts and make up your own mind from there.  
There are too many scammers in the cryptoworld and I have been had by a few.  But I have learnt to always assess the situation and make my own mind up.  I won't sell mcxnow to you because more deposits = less interest for myself.  But do some research and come to your own conclusion.  Hope this helps in any way!

That's a good argument for it.  Imagine if PayPal were to create an online wallet, I'm sure it would ruffle a few feathers.

Looks good!  I just used it to apply for a small job, the flow of the site is great!
