I think that's exactly what Paul knows about it. He was honest enough to say he doesn't understand the back-end of it all.

And people to piggy back and steal.

Didn't Obama pass some order that the Feds wouldn't do this?

Thanks for a bit of sanity here. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:18:38
Thanks for the information. Shame.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:03:36
The economists might be savvy.
@_date: 2014-01-25 23:03:50
I wouldn't say that about some of these people...

Thank you for reminding me to read up on this update. I despise the feature, (well, the implementation that appears to suck up my phone), but wanted to catch up on the reasoning. 
@_date: 2012-03-12 17:01:03
No, as I've just copyrighted it and capitalized on your innocent brilliance. (The above post nets me .23 cents.) 
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:59:17
Ah, thanks. Here's to good fortune and good rolling. What a world we live in. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:35:17
Oh dear. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:40:01
To that extent though, look at those keywords and phrases from someone (such as ourselves) who are interested in these emerging technologies. They are typically used as pure buzzwords and are eventually degraded to meaning nothing.

To say it's stable up until this point is still up in the air, dude... is it legitimate, probably. Stable currency? Not yet. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:04:56
That's pretty cool. I have no idea how that works and haven't bought in yet (into bitcoin), but congratulations. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:13:28
I respectfully disagree with your statement. So long as the most common way of valuing a single bitcoin is in terms of the dollar, it hasn't gone anywhere. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:47:48
Meaning, they'd have to sell them off?
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:39:38
Don't ask me why, but I am thankful.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:18:40
I think it needs to prove that itself first, honestly. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:37:49
How do I play!
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:48:25
So it would be impossible to roll with the changes, even with the assumed supercomputer? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:27:34
Agreed. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:49:42
I saw a figure around the year 2140 as the estimate of the "last block mined" -- would this blind plunge of resources hurry that endgame? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:54:28
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:24:50
Awesome, thanks for all the information. My friend also told me that they're generated "once every ten minutes" -- is that set in stone, or is that just the de facto rate? 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:57:12
Good luck! I don't sell anything but [write a blog here]( about urban exploration and didn't want to make a whoring out post on the main board, so I'll piggy back. Great work and good luck!
