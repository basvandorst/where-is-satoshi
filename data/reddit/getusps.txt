Thanks for the endorsement. Yes postal rates did go up and we are always trying to keep it competitive wrt PO. We will be adding Express mail very soon. Only First Class/ Priority / Flat Rates for now.
Don't forget to try our batch label printing - very convenient for merchants.

Thanks! Priority Express labels are coming in about two weeks along with better handling of mispaid/expired bitcoin payments. Pls share and spread the word!

Glad you are liking the print features. As for the payments, we are bound by the limits of the bitcoin network. We use Coinbase for checkout which sets a 15min limit to receive the payment. They set this time limit due to the fluctuating exchange rate of XBT.
We are looking at improving this process.
