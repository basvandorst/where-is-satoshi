Same thing here.  It was fixed about an hour later for me.

Stop being such a drama queen.  It's true.

It's expensive.  15%-20%.   For example, I bought 50 dollars worth the other day  but my wallet only received 42 dollars worth.  (16% in my case.  Bitcoin was purchased.)

It's not BCash. Why do you all insist on calling it something that it is not named?  It's Bitcoin Cash.  It's like calling Obama, Barry.  You are not slick.

People that don't like Bitcoin Cash call it that.  It's really called Bitcoin Cash but they want to be assholes and call it by something it's not named.  If someone uses the name BCash, ignore them.  They are trying to mislead you.  This whole thread is full of them.

What if the internet goes down?

Seriously.  What if a solar flare knocks everything out electrical.   How do we spend our coins?

I'm liking AirBitz so far.  Anyone have any complaints about AirBitz?

Quick question people.  I have one of these machines close to me.  I'm told or I have read that for under 500 dollars worth of bitcoin, the verification is just a pin they send to my phone.  What happens on my second visit?  If I do another transaction less than 500 do they just send me a pin again?  Or do they keep track of the cumulative amount bought?  I think the next verification up is either a finger print or driver licence.   Anyone know specifically how these work?

I'm still trying to make sense of all this but one thing I do know is that decentralization is a MUST. Anything that attempts to centralize bitcoin is not good for bitcoin.
