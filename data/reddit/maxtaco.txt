The last challenge hasn't been brute-forced yet, so that's a good sign [1]. I know of several people who store substantially more bitcoin than 10 with WW, so this challenge is a nice canary for them.

We post one transaction every 6 hours, as LifeIsSoSweet says.  But we can post as much data as we want internally.  It all hashes down to the one value that we post to bitcoin.

The private key is just the bits, as shown in this post:
bitaddress.org uses the same technique, but they don't stretch their keys.
You need EC crypto to compute the public key from the private key.

The 3-character challenge and r/Bitcoin challenge are meant to be solvable in short order.  Two of the challenges have already fallen.  The final challenge should be really hard, but it's good to know if it breaks.

Sorry about that. p=1 and r=8 are the parameters suggested by Percival in the paper, so we used those.

This isn't exactly right.  Litecoin has an N=2^10 work factor for scrypt, whereas WarpWallet chooses N=2^18.  So you've underestimated by a factor of 256 at the very least.
Additionally, I'm not sure how you can get 200MH/s without a significant expenditure.  According to this table, a very high end GPU can get you 1MH/s (on Litecoin): 
I've seen advertisements for ASICs that claim to get 5MH/s, but those aren't available yet and will probably cost tens of thousands of dollars when they are.
Our back-of-the-envelope shows that for the $10k ASIC miner, it would take you 2^(47-22+8-1)=2^32 seconds = 2^(32-25) years = 128 years to break this wallet.  Using brute force.  Maybe there's a bug in our implementation and it can be broken much faster.

You shouldn't need to know much about Web or JS to win.  The pseudocode shows all that's going on, and we've implemented it in other languages to test our implementation.

Or programmatically exhaust the possibilities.

There are several easily-achievable bounties.
