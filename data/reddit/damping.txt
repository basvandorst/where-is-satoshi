This is what happens when you get brainwashed by the right wing.
It's time to open your eyes and realize you have been repeatedly lied to.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:11
LOL. So are you a network admin or a sales lead? It seems like you are nothing more than a liar. Nothing new for Trump supporters. Fake macho, fake accomplishments and loads of projection.
Get a job snowflake. Trolling on Reddit isn't one. Tell mommy to make the tendies extra spicy today.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:22:04
lol. They are a lot of triggered Republican snowflakes with a part time temp job. 
You are no different.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:46:51
Wouldn't last 4 seconds doing what? Are you fantasizing about a fight? Didn't I already go over how obviously fake macho you are.
Come on buddy. You are a proven liar desperately trying to defend himself. It's like Trump when he is backed into a corner. Just starts lashing out. No wonder you love him. Gives you hope?
You seem like the kind of guy who thinks he is alpha and everyone likes him while everyone honestly just thinks he is an ass. Probably don't get invited to many places but show up anyways huh?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:29
Uh bruh, you used MacBooks like an insult even though you are a huge apple fanboy. Seems like you kinda hate yourself. 
I'm a regular PC man myself. But it's not like apple wouldn't suffice for what I use it for.

My goal is not to win. I'm here to have fun. Exactly what would I accomplish. This guy isn't changing his mind. Not that we are actually arguing about anything. Just a good old fashioned flame war.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:52:32
lol. Come on man. You need to do better than this. If you are going to flame someone do better than a 7th grader. 
I hope you are lying about being 39. If not, yikes.
I continue because it's fun seeing cucks BTFO. Anyone trying to "win" an internet argument needs help.

Yeah, but money isn't everything. 
My friends even making 100k+ bonus at Deutsche and Goldman still lived like 5 people in a 3 man apartment in NYC. It was a dope location though. Like a few blocks from the WTC1. Great view. But you spend so much time in the office, you rarely get to actually enjoy the perks of living in NYC. 
Nothing worse than wanting to hang out but they can't get the weekend off...
It'll probably be great long term though. But that's a tough 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:20:08
lol. You don't know how many times I have asked that question.
Investment banks want the best. And it's cheaper to hire one person and make them work 80-100. A lot of them resort to cocaine and many of them become depressed. And yes, there are plenty of studies that says productivity falls off a cliff after 40 hours.
In terms of hourly wage, me and my friend compared it and I make more per hour at $65,000 yearly as an engineer who works 40 hours compared to his 90K +55K bonus.
The real reason people accept the job is it really sets you up for the future. People rarely stay after the required 2 years to keep your big signing bonus.

Lmao at thinking debt is an issue.
Not surprising from a Bitcoin fan.
America is the most powerful government on Earth considering they lead NATO, have the largest and best funded military and control the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:34:06
Look bud. It's not hard to see. Anyone with a good job doesn't go around mentioning it in his username and comment like its so hard to get one. 
You got some job that pays a dollar above minimum wage and think that's some kind of accomplishment. You certainly don't have a good education based on your comment history.

You do understand that block chain potentially being successful in no way means Bitcoin will be right?
Remember when AOL and Yahoo were the biggest names on the internet? Bitcoin is the AOL of block chain.
Regardless, crypto will continue to fail as long as they continue to make the currencies deflationary and the sentiment of most users continues to be "HODL" instead of spend.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:48:03
Yeah definitely. The banks they work for are Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase etc. So really big name banks. The kind of banks that can loan hundreds of millions of dollars so a Corporation can buy another. 
It is definitely an ingrained cultural thing and because of the opportunities it gives you, they still get tons of applicants each year and they only accept the best, so the companies have no incentive to make it better. It's practically an analyst job where they have to do all the busy work while the partners in the companies get to work on bigger things. 
After 2 years, some become partners in the company, but most move on the corporate finance, accounting, hedge fund and private wealth management, etc and usually get the same or more pay, with less hours. They sacrifice those 2 years for the future.
And I wouldn't say the skills are actually that unique.I think most finance majors could do it. But you have to go to a top Business school and have a top GPA and great internships and extra circulars to ever get the job.

Good luck bro. A number of my college buddies went into Investment Banking. 80-100 hour work weeks take a toll. 
Where you going to be working? NYC or Chicago? Or somewhere else?
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:41:26
Just because something is scarce doesn't make it valuable.
And you didn't address the fact that deflationary currency does not work. It disincentivises investment and economic growth. Deflation is the reason Japan has been in a 30 year long recession.
I trust the Fed far more than I trust a faceless currency run by dubious exchanges on the internet.
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:07:44
Lmao. Bitcoin is a fiat currency. It's value is completely dependent on what morons like yourself believe it's worth.
At least the US dollar is backed by the most powerful government on Earth.
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:13:19
It's backed by baseless speculation by idiots trying to make a quick buck.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:49:15
And now you are calling me a girl as an insult? Honestly are you in middle school?
Yikes. This is bad. Did your mom drink while you were in the womb?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:06:46
Money stored in banks goes back into the economy with loans.
Does money put in Bitcoin go back into the economy?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:00:24
lol what? If no one stored their money in a bank they wouldn't have any money to loan.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:46:38
You right, 
It didn't age well lol.
