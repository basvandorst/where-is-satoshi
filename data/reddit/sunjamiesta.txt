Lmao you left out any logic dealing with hashpower.. instead chose to use the price of 1 block reward of bitcoin as price point for executing 1 block successful  rewind attack. It doesnt cost 12.5 bitcoin to do an attack... it cost 51% of the entire hashpower of bitcoin... do u know how many miners there are and how much in electricity is being spent on hashpower alone? 95k is a drop in a bucket.. some estimates say bitcoin uses as much electricty as the country of Ireland...  think about that for a moment.. and how much it will cost you to own 51% of btc hashpower to execute an attack... where does one even acquire that much hash power lol..

You cannot store raw images, links, videos, audio on the bitcoin blockchain. The reports that theres child porn stored on bitcoins blockchain for everyone to distribute and access is a complete and utter LIE! End of story.

how the f**k is the average person ever going to find this? Its not directly stored for all to read or view because its encoded. Back to what others are saying theres alot of encoded links on the internet in general too so lets just ban the whole internet? The second link u posted is for bcash blockchain NOT BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN!

No you CANNOT store raw images/links on the blockchain. Because it is NOT designed for storing any images or media content! This is just media FUD! There is no child porn in bitcoins blockchain and there is NO proof.

You sir are a moron. You've completely distorted my argument to try and justify your own flawed argument, which makes no sense! I'm not talking about bitcoin cash! Or the rivaly! Where are you taking this discussion Lol.. its pretty clear there is NO CP on the blockchain and you can't store links and images directly on the blockchain either. So theres no need to ban bitcoin. This whole news piece is just a load of BS. End of story.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:29:57
Wheres the evidence? That theres CP stored on the blockchain. Do u even understand how blockchain works..? oh wait ur not allowed to see the evidence because its illegal... good cover up. And I dont believe it. This news is just FUD!
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:52:38
Well Known!! Haha listen to this guy. Do u honestly believe in what your saying. Because sorry you're an absolute moron. And for the record im talking about bitcoin blockchain not some other random blockchain. Because thats what this whole argument is about.

The idea that child porn is stored, distributed and made available to everyone that uses bitcoin is a LIE! There is no child porn on bitcoins blockchain and there is ZERO proof that its there and all users are distributing it. The child porn reports are all made up claims that have not been proven. In my opinnion the news outlets have sold us a fabricated story to make money for themselves. There are genuine victims of child abuse out there and news outlets in this case are profitting off what is a terrible act of crime. Absolutely disgraceful!

It does matter and your example is irrelevant because copyright material illegally downloaded music and movies are not secretly encoded. This shit is.
Your second response is correct. But no one has knowlegde of the CP in blockchain nor how to access it. We dont know if it even exists we are just taking some peoples word for it.
The link you posted is a paid service for bitcoin cash and doesnt apply to bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is not bitcoin. End of story.
