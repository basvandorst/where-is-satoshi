Does he remember where and how he bought it? And if he stored it on an exchange / online wallet, or did he install one on his computer / phone?

The only real answer is that no one has any fucking idea what will happen. Anyone who tells you that this is a safe investment is insane. Any number of things could happen tomorrow that completely hammer the price, or send it to the moon. Everyone will speculate what caused the rise or fall, but even AFTER the price movements happen no one is really sure. There is just too much going on usually to know for sure what is causing the price to be what it is.
Do what YOU want to do. Just please read about protecting your coins if you do buy in. It is all on you to keep them safe and there is a long history of "reputable" companies going under and taking investors coins with them.

Squarespace commerce uses Stripe. Does this mean that I will finally be able to build a bitcoin ecommerce site on there?

I used them successfully for a while, but I don't know much about the company itself...

I'm a US importer of general merchandise, would love to pay BTC for goods.
@_date: 2015-04-02 03:30:14
Actually I was not - thank you!
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:34:19
Haha I agree. Not what I'm looking for.

Did you know that you can increase your profit margin by eliminating or reducing fees from credit card processors and Paypal? You may have heard of Bitcoin, it has been in the news a lot lately. It is a very interesting form of digital currency that can do amazing things (more info here:  but in order for you to use it to save money right now you don't need to be an expert. By accepting payment in Bitcoin, you can avoid fees and reduce chargebacks. Lots of major companies like Overstock.com, Dell, Microsoft, &amp; DISH Networks are starting to accept it for these reasons.
To make it easy for you to integrate with your business, there are lots of tools and plugins available for most major ecommerce platforms, and many in store POS systems.
A common misconception is that by accepting Bitcoin, you will be receiving Bitcoin. **The truth is that if you don't want to hold Bitcoin at all, you don't have to.** Companies like Bitpay make it easy to accept Bitcoin that is immediately converted to cash to your bank account.
I hope this has convinced you that accepting Bitcoin is a worthwhile and profitable thing to try. You may even see a nice boost in business from Bitcoin enthusiasts when you announce that you are accepting it!
Thank you for your time, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me!

Wow thank you so much I had no idea these existed, tools like these are essential.
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:05:36
Please advise what country you are in so people can make relevant recommendations.

You are correct - I will get them to update it. Thank you for making us aware!

In this scenario local economies / local governments might be a thing of the past. Not saying it will go either way, but I think its somewhat logical that if we are imagining a future in which the entire earth were on Bitcoin, the structure of government / power would likely not look like it does today. That could be a great thing...or an awful thing.

I am a distributor of products to Overstock and many online stores. I would put a hardware wallet into my product line right away if any of these companies are interested (so far, the ones I've contacted aren't).
I feel there is a lack of mainstream "Bitcoin products" available to regular people. I know that sounds stupid and pointless... but sometimes people's way of getting into something, is to buy a book or a gadget.
When you search for bitcoin on major online stores right now, it's all t-shirts and keychains and crap for people who are already in the know. I think that's a problem.
If anyone has a way to change that and wants distribution, please PM me.

Thank you!
Back in the day when I made a BTC webstore this wasn't so easy. Happy to see the tools improving.

Yes they went fast. Just added more stock - should be available shortly.
Also, the duo version (two wallets) is still in stock currently:

It looks like they're all affiliate links rather than an actual store - so mostly you'd need to convince amazon since most of their links just go straight to amazon product listings

Can you imagine working there? Heart attack city
