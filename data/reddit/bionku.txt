I presume this was seized under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  If so, all assets are gobbled up.

With all of the lag and stress on servers, where can I actually buy Bitcoins for the first time?

It is my understanding (slightly less new buyer) that the transaction made last night has been locked in; you might be able to confirm this buy looking back and seeing if you can cancel the order and the wording (You have bought vs you have ordered).  My first bitcoin took 3-4 days to move to my possession, but the price was the same I agreed upon, despite the price having changed.
Sorry, you have to deal with please like diomed.  For a group of people so eager to get people to adopt btc, there sure are a few people out there who would do us all a better service by shutting their mouth.
