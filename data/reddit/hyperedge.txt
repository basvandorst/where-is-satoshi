I just went through this. The mining fee +2 -2 thing is useless, going from -1 to -2 changed my fee from .0011 to .001...... like theres almost no point. .001 is as low as it goes. My transaction ended up being 450 satoshi /byte when 50 would have been fine. Also be aware that if you use the exchange built into bitpie they charge you .0012 to move btc from the exchange (piebank) back to your normal wallet and then hit u again withdrawing out of bitpie.

I read all your comments in this thread, most of your "arguments" don't even make sense. Its easy for other coins to have faster and cheaper transactions when their value is low and nobody is barely using them. You are not seeing the big picture here. Sure Bitcoin transaction fees and times have gone way up because of the massive influx of new users globally and a 15X price increase in just several months. Just because it is that way today doesn't mean that these things aren't being worked on and won't be fixed in the future. If you tried to take any of these cheaper and faster coins and tried to use them as a currency with global mass adoption they would all crumble instantly. They can't scale! Even your precious Bcash would be crushed. The only way these coins could scale would be with major centralization which defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created to be a decentralized censorship free currency and store of value. The Core developers know this and are looking for long term solutions not quick fixes that will blow up in their faces later or cause more centralization. Crypto is still new, give things time to mature, Rome wasn't built in a day.

Yes exatcly the same as Core wallet but just no downloading of the blockchain. Once you make the wallet and send your funds to it, the wallet file can be found at "C:\Users\PartyRooster\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Electrum\electrum_data\wallets" make copies of your wallet and put them on a usb stick.

Bitcoin Core wallet will require you to download and sync the entire 150GB blockchain. You could try an light wallet like Electrum which doesn't require you to do that and would probably work much faster for you.

The devs better be careful, they are crossing a line where many companies have failed in the past because they became arrogant and stopped listening to their users because they thought they knew whats best for them even when their users didnt want it.

If miners leave then the difficulty adjusts and bitcoin carries on as normal as new ones take their place or the ones who left come back because bitcoin is the most profitable coin to mine with their hardware. The miners work for the network, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:17:23
Calling Bitcoin, "Bitcoin Core" is a way to make "Bitcoin Cash" sound more legitimate by making them sound similar and as equals to newbies. It's the same reason they never say Bcash forked away from the bitcoin chain. Instead they always portray it as bitcoin split into two, one side is Bitcoin Core the other Bitcoin Cash.

Remembering dialog is much easier than remember a long string of random words. Relying on memory is a terrible idea. A good technique for storing your seed words is to break them up into pieces and hide them separately. You could also encode these pieces if and put them in an order than only you would know how to decipher. Be creative.

All the Bcash guys on Twitter including Roger Ver and  all use a shared block list. They say its just for trolls but they ban anyone who says anything negative about Bcash. Banned from one, banned from all, even if you have never interacted with the other Twitter handles. It's far worse than anything they complain about here.
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:19:30
It was really a perfect storm of several reasons:
-Hype cycle with unprecedented new users.
-Segwit not fully adopted yet.
-Coinbase, Bitpay and exchanges not batching their transactions or using Segwit.
-Coinbase and Bitpay at times charging their users 5x the cost to get in the next block. Everyone else required to leapfrog them.
-Wallets with inaccurate fee estimation or inability to change fees.
-Bcash EDA causing significant hash rate to leave temporarily when Bcash was more profitable to mine when network demand was at its heaviest.
-Mempool being spammed heavily moments after the difficulty change.
-Price quadrupled in six weeks. Since transactions are paid in satoshi's and the price rose so fast, fees didn't have time to adjust and essentially quadrupled the fees. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:20:16

Yes, Bitmain also owns over 1 million Bcash coins.
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:51:15
Well it was actually .092, but try zooming out and looking at the 1 day chart. It is clear as day that outside of these super pumps Bcash only goes down. Ver and his buddies keep trying to kick start Bcash with these huge pumps but as soon as they stop the price goes right back to a downward trend because there is no real demand for Bcash. This pump is their last ditch effort to feign interest in bcash before the fork. They will stop pumping it sometime shortly after. If you bought in cheap, kudos, but I would be looking to get out fairly soon before the big dump.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:16:41

It makes sense that they would talk about Bitcoin a lot because it is the 1# cryptocurrency. But then ask yourself why would CNBC keep trying to pump BCH hard and give it so much airtime, a crypto used less than Dogecoin, when literally no other network is really talking about it much? Well it all makes sense when you know that the Marketing manager of CNBC is Gaby Wasensteiner who is married to the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Cash Fund, Paul Wasensteiner. What's even worse is that it appeared that Paul Wasensteiner was in control of the CNBC Fast Money Twitter telling Bitcoin fans to "Deal with it!".
Then the cherry on the top is that Brian Kelly who is mostly responsible for the Bcash pumping on CNBC has his own history of creating pump n dump coins.  Definitely some shady shit going on here.
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:55:49
I mean fine, if you want to call them out on twitter or wherever they are doing their fraud, I get it. I constantly call them out on reddit when they post their nonsense in other subs. But litering this sub with constant Bcash news has become annoying and a distraction. It's only helping them. We all already know whats going on, I dont need a daily reminder of it. I would make an exception if its actual big news but most of the time it's just meme's now or reposts. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 05:18:47
I specifically said "Pointing out **suspected** fraud..."
It appears that you are the one who doesn't understand what evidence means. Definition from the dictionary to help you out "the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid." 
When I say evidence, I mean there is enough evidence that points to fraud being a possibility, not that it proves their guilt. If you put as much effort into reading as you do with your responses, you might have picked up on that.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:03:04

Bcash was a minority fork without consensus. You guys try to call it a "split" to make it sound like Bcash has more support than it really does. A split would imply the two sides are equal which is clearly not the case.

Impressive use of colorful language with a healthy dose of mental gymnastics there! Kudos! Unfortunately nothing you said is actually true. There is no "threat of violence" over some "philosophical disagreement." Nobody is trying to "shut up" anyone's ideas here. You being very manipulative.
What this is about is some of the employees at CNBC Fast Money, being guilty of fraud, or at the very least of being unethical in positions where they have a huge conflict of interest. The Marketing Manager of CNBC is Gaby Wasensteiner who is married to the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Cash Fund, Paul Wasensteiner. To make things worse, it appears that Paul Wasensteiner was in control of the CNBC Fast Money Twitter pumping Bcash telling Bitcoin fans to "Deal with it!". 
Then there is Brian Kelly who is mostly responsible for the Bcash pumping on the CNBC Fast Money show. Ask yourself, why would CNBC keep trying to pump BCH so hard and give it so much airtime, when literally no other network is really talking about it that much? A crypto used so little that it has even less transactions than Dogecoin, a meme coin. Also Brian Kelly has a history of creating and pushing his own pump and dump shitcoin. 
Pointing out suspected fraud, especially when there is a lot of evidence, is not impeding on anyone's free speech or their ideas. That notion is completely ridiculous. Fraud makes the whole crypto community look bad, the faster we weed out the bad actors the better. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:21:23

If you post over there and get downvoted, you get labeled as a low karma poster and a bot will follow you around breaking down your post history and karma in replies to any new comment you make, which just encourages even more downvoting. Its a way to silence critics without banning them so they can keep crying about free speech and censorship.

The way things stand now, Segwit will never move forward. The longer we are stuck at this impasse, the more damage will be done to bitcoin and its future. I really feel that compromise is the only way we can get back on track. I think Core should offer Segwit + 2MB hard fork. This way both sides get something they want and the extra 1MB of block space will instantly speed up transactions and lower fees and give some breathing room while we get segwit and lightning up and running. I really don't see any other way out of this deadlock.

@_date: 2017-08-02 02:14:02
make sure you are connected to a BCC (ABC) server and not a BTC server. I noticed that Electrum and Electron Cash share the same server list. Same thing happened to me on both ends. Turn off select server automatically in Electron Cash and make sure to pick a server that has abc in the name. Then your BCC should show back up. Also you can check the bitcoin cash block explorer to know for sure. I think its blockchair.com
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:41:37
Almost all Bitpay merchants are paid in USD and never even touch or hold crypto. The conversion is done at the time of purchase so the merchant isnt exposed to price volatility of crypto.

This is why I was confused when Coinbase announced their intention to be a SEC approved exchange. Like how in hell would they get approved for that after the bcash insider trading scandal? I also thought it was strange that Coinbase held on to everyones fork coins for six months as to not allow their customers to dump their bcash and crash the price. I hope they fry his ass.

We are less than 50% from bitcoins all time high, so if you lost more than that it must have been from trading or buying shitcoins. If i was you i would just hodl. You can easily get back what you lost and then some if you simply do nothing for the rest of the year at least.

Ya I know I could have sent it much cheaper with only having to wait a few blocks but this merchant seems to process Bitcoin transactions manually so I just wanted to get it to them ASAP and get my item shipped right away. I will have to experiment with some ultra low fee transactions now that the mempool is cleared to get a feel for what I can get away with.

I figured BCH was being pumped right before the fork to make it more profitable to mine to further disrupt Bitcoin during the fork to split the miners 3 ways. Since 2X is no longer happening, it will be interesting to see if it drops back down to its price pre pump.

This is all part of a plan to attack Bitcoin. The BCH group are spamming the network to crete the backlog while at the same time getting the chinese miners to pull hashrate. This is what is causing the massive backlog. It is not normal. Falkvinge is saying this because he is personally invested into bcash now and just wants to take your money. You've been warned.

The BCH fanboys on reddit follow the same logic as this diagram to obfusicate the fact that Bcash is an alt coin. They try to portray Bitcoin with Segwit as a non consensus hardfork like Bcash so that they can tell noobs that Bcash and Core are equals and have the same legitamcy to the Bitcoin name. Pure fraud.

Its the same reason he never calls Bitcoin just Bitcoin. He always referes to it as Bitcoin Core to make Bitcoin Cash sound more normal and make it seem as the two sides are equal. This is his way of trying to obfusicate the fact that Bcash is an altcoin.

I've been saying this for awhile, They hate being called bcash because it interferes with their brand hijacking and they always call Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core to make Bitcoin Cash sound more legitimate.

This looks like the Bcash scam all over again but instead using the bitcoin AND lightning name to further confuse new people. Just like bcash they also stole the logo and only slightly modified it. It also sucks that the use the LBTC ticker because I have seen the actual bitcoin lightning network being refered to as BTCL. Anyone who held Bitcoin in December owns some except if it was in a Segwit wallet. Some people initally figured out how to extract from a Segwet wallet but these scammy devs actually rolled back the blockchain to purposely block that if you can believe it. You can dump this shit here

I understand what you are saying, I'm not trying to say that we should let them completely off the hook and forget what they have done in the past but the whole point of calling them out was to force them to comply to the wishes of the community, they are complying now so take the criticism down a notch for now and see if they continue to do whats right. If they stray off the path again then by all means bring it on. Putting pressure on a company to change won't work if there is no reward for them to change. Acknowledging the good things they do will help them stick to doing whats right. If you blast them no matter what they do good or bad then what incentive do they have to change?

There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of thought put into this predicition other than gold is worth 7 trillion and Bitcoin is gold 2.0 so Bitcoin will be worth 7 trillion. That being said 40X does not sound that ridiculous to me. This is crypto. Before the crash Ethereum was up almost 150X from Jan 2017. If 40X happens I think it will be sooner than people expect. Bitcoin can also disrupt other markets increasing it's value even more.

Buddy whats your problem? Reading through this thread, you come off as a complete fucking twat. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:00:14
Give it a rest. 1 dollar for now is fine. Still cheaper then most other places right now. They are providing a service so a 1 dollar tx fee isnt a huge deal. I get why people have issues with Shapeshift but they seem to be finally doing the right thing along with coinbase by using Segwit, batching and lowering fees. If your going to put a company on blast for doing things you don't agree with you also have to give them credit when they do. Remember the whole point of putting the on blast was to put pressure on them to change. They are changing so relax and put down the pitchfork for  5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:47:02
I would be fine with a 2mb block but the problem with 2x is that it's entire purpose is basicaly to remove the Core developers from the project. It's an attempt to hijack Bitcoin and really doesn't have much to do with actual scaling.

That way anyone can link to it to show others who Roger Ver really is in an easy to read and digest format. We could also keep it updated with all his new lies which you know are coming. You could also ad to this that Roger Ver thinks that insider trading is totally OK and should be legal and the fact that he keeps co-opting the  hashtag meant for survivors of sexual assault to push his bcash scam.

Im not familiar with this wallet and never heard of a wallet that does this conversion of coins but i noticed that is says from the freewallet team. Im pretty sure a lot of people have complained about getting scammed from those guys. They probably charged you 8 dollars fir the conversion to eth. I would either convert it back and send to a better wallet like electrum or withdraw to an ethereum wallet and change back to btc using shapeshift or right in coinbase. Ethier way you will have to pay a fee to change back. Sorry this happened to you but you should do more research before you decide to try a new wallet.

The Bitcoin Cash community claims that Bitcoin is not really Bitcoin because of Segwit/Lightning and that on chain scaling is the only way because that was Satoshi's vision. I highly doubt they would EVER use Lightning as they have been shit talking it since it came out. They would have to eat some serious crow to use lightning but they won't because their entire identity is wrapped around big blocks.

Nice try but wrong! Bitcoin never forked, Bitcoin Cash forked off the main Bitcoin chain and created their own alt coin, while the vast majority stayed with Bitcoin. Stop lying and trying to portray the situation as Bitcoin simply split in two, thats not what happened. Bitcoin Cash is the same thing as Bitcoin Gold and every other Bitcoin fork, an alt coin, not Bitcoin.

Jesus christ can you be any more of an ignorant fucking moron. Yes you are a fucking bcash shill. You arent just asking a question your trying to push your agenda. Heres a post from just today.


Learn to fucking read you muppet. I clearly explained this already. Core uprading the block size a little bit at a time is not the same as unlimited blocks.  Bcash is already going 32MB next month. Bitcoin may not even increase the blocks at all for the next couple of years. By the time Bitcoin goes 4MB what will Bcash be at 128? 256? Not that it matters as Bcash is so unpopular it currently is only using less tha half of 1&amp; of the current 8MB blocks for transactions.


You really are clueless aren't you. I'm talking about making the blockchain efficient not fucking Lightning. Im talking about thing like MAST and Schnorr signatures.
The 3 independent groups working on lightning are all working on different clients and working together as whole to improve the network. You really think that programmers and computer scientist are just wasting their time translating the white paper?
Oh Core didn't develop Segwit now? All your muppet friends in /rbtc are convinced Segwit was a poison pill forced onto Bitcoin from the Core developers to benefit Blockstream, now they didn't even make it? Can you even remember what narrative your supposed to be shilling anymore?


This is rich coming from the guy who didn't even understand that big blocks centralize nodes. Do you even understand what a node does? Do you care? I hope you're 100&amp; invested in bcash. You deserve it.

Oh look, my original comment was correct. You weren't here just asking questions, you're a  bcash shill with an agenda just like I said you were. Imagine that.
Big blocks are bad because they centralize nodes not mining. If you're going to make an argument at least try to understand the very basics first. If only data centers can afford to run nodes and it takes an eternity to sync the blockchain, then nobody will be able to verify their own transactions. You will then be REQUIRED to trust a 3rd party \(probably a corporation like Bitmain\) to verify them for you. That means Bcash will no longer be a trustless system and will become fully centralized. Welcome to Paypal 2.0. This is Rogers end game, not money for the people. He has already gone on record and said that he would be totally OK if Bitcoin became Paypal 2.0. This goes against everything bitcoin was created for.
The only narrative trying to be pushed here is yours. There is a big difference between gradually raising the block size a little bit at a time, only as needed rather than just opening the flood gates and jumping straight into huge massive blocks and cramming every micro transaction into a bloated blockchain. The difference here is that the Core developers are actually innovating and creating ways to optimize blocks and make the blockchain as efficient as possible before having to increase the block size.  Bcash is just using the blockchain as a garbage dump thinking they can just keep increasing the blocks endlessly without repercussions.

If the US gov felt this domain was being used to commit fraud against US citizens, they could confiscate the domain name completely.

This guy is a shill pretending to be some innocent new user just asking a simple question. This seems to be Bcasher shills new approach. Ive seen a huge influx of these types of posts. Always from a new redditor within the past 3 months.
Look at his very first comment links to a BCH shillers youtube spreading Lightning Fud. Then he's asking of BTC has smart contracts. Bcash is now trying to push smart contracts with opcodes. Now he's all like wait interenet transactions arent cheap and fast, sham! Of course this times perfectly with a huge wad of spam hitting the mempool. His comment  reads exactly like a Roger Ver talking point. 
These posts should be nuked as they only serve one purpose, to spread lies and FUD.

Ya im pretty sure he called bcash a shitcoin last year.

Your buy fee may be close to other ATM's (which is still high) but your self fee is much higher. Some ATM's in Toronto only charge 3% sell.

This guy is a complete tool, who cares what he says.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:28:24
Yes Armstrong is still liking all of Roger's Bcash is bitcoin tweets to this day. Did anything ever happen to the whole insider trading thing with Coinbase and Bcash?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:34:37
Oh look yet another bcash shill posing as some newbie "just asking questions". Been seeing a massive flood of these types of posts. These guys aren't looking for actual answers, they are asking loaded questions so when you try and answer them they can unload their FUD.
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:32:24
Trademark is irrelevant. If you go to any exchange on the planet BTC is Bitcoin and BCH is Bitcoin Cash. What do you would think would happen if some whale bought 1 million dollars worth of Bitcoin but the exchange instead gave him Bitcoin Cash? That exchange would get sued and be opening themselves up to criminal charges of fraud.  BCH is Bitcoin Cash NOT Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:32:17
Looks like the Bitcoin twitter is back and unsuspended again but now restricted. Anyone know wtf is going on?
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:43:33
Oh I see, so when someone who supports Bitcoin does something like this they are guilty of censorship and hindering your free speech, but when someone else does the same thing who supports Bcash, it's just a tool to block trolls..... how convenient.
@_date: 2018-04-23 19:44:34
This is outright fraud. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:06:11
Its as if you dont even read the comments you are replying to. You're just making stuff up now. When did i say different opinions arent good?
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:33:31
Who gives a shit what Roger thinks. The truth is the truth.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:44:59
Read the top comment. He was banned for making a poll asking  a simple question. This is just an excuse so they can blanket block anyone who questions them not just trolls.  Bcashers are textbook projectors. They pretty much do everything they accuse others of,  but you probably already knew that.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:21:12
Even if that were true it still doesn't make it Bitcoin. What so hard to understand that you need consensus? Anyone can fork off of Bitcoin, but without consensus and all the users following then it's just another altcoin forked off the main chain. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:06:38




Is that clear enough for you?
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:28:13
Yup thats it. No idea whats going on now.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:36:19


You haven't refuted anything because you don't even understand the basics and cant seem to even grasp simple concepts.  Ive tried explaining things to you, but your tiny brain doesn't seem able to comprehend it. Every time I point out something that you're wrong about, you just ignore it and start whining about something else. 
The only people pushing Bcash are shills and rubes who fell for the lie. At first I thought you were just a shill but now you have confirmed you are just a dumb rube who is easily manipulated and gullible.
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:35:07
This thread is frustrating. You asked a pretty straight forward simple question, yet you are getting a ton of answers that don't answer it. What he is asking people is it worth it to lock up your coins and provide liquidity for the LN. Basically will you make enough in relay fees to make it worth your time and be able to turn a profit? I would like to know the answer to this as well. If I was to guess, I would say right now probably not because of low volume, but once the network grows and you are relaying at high volume, it should become profitable.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:08:37
They dont need to ban you. If you say anything remotely against the narrative there, even respectfully, you will get downvoted into oblivion and nobody will see your post anymore just like if you were banned.

The entire agreement was created without asking any input from the devs. Not sure if they were invited after the fact but its not surprising they wouldnt show up if they were since the real reason s2x was created was to try and take over development and push out the core devs. Basically there was no agreement.

Or you sell on the start of the way down and then it suddenly gets pumped again and you FOMO in at a loss. Thanks for the concern no-coiner!

Roger Ver is like Trump. He constantly lies, twists truths and creates his own reality and everyone knows it but somehow he gets away with it. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:46:27
As far as I understand it, all you need is some type of maleability fix to use Lightning, it doesn't need to be Segwit. But coins like Bitcoin Cash will never use lightning, because their whole marketing campaign is on chain scaling only and that 2nd layer scaling such as lightning is not what bitcoin should do. When Lightning matures and finally takes off, I can see other coins jumping on lightning as well and Bcash will get left behind.
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:52:19
Yes  I am aware of that. It's always been in the roadmap.  Whats your point?
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:13:08
Well it was a regular long standing account that quitely posted Bitcoin news for years without much fuss. Then suddenly about 6 months ago whoever was in control of that handle started trashing bitcoin and attacking everyone who supports BTC while posting BCH propganada non stop. A complete 180 within a couple of days. Noone knows for sure if its Roger but it is for sure at least someone from his camp. Roger loves his propaganda It does fit Rogers's MO with and bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:56:29
Even worse, after crying non stop about censorship and free speech, they are now creating a massive block list to censor opposing opinions.

Increasing the block size to 2mb isn't a willy-nilly increase.  I understand the centralization issues with larger block sizes but I think 2mb max block size would be OK in that regard.

Problem is Segwit will never activate unless both sides compromise. Lets be realistic here, something needs to happen sooner than later.

Sorry did i hurt your little snowflake right wing feelings? RT stands for "Russia Today" and is owned and controlled by the Kremlin. Public knowledge. So is the fact that Russia uses troll farms to create fake news and influence public opinion. Again this is all public knowledge backed by facts. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:02:00
Fair enough. But the time taken to comment and then reply to him was far more than enough to just answer his question.
