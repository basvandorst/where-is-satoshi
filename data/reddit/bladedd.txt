Convert Doge to USD, buy whatever you want. Amazon, NewEgg and Costco don't accept Bitcoin, who the hell cares about Overstock.com or TigerDirect?

Why not treat it like firearms or tobacco? Restrict the sale of the product to those 18+, put a warning message on the package, and start a campaign to educate the masses on the dangers of swallowing magnets? 
From their site: "The paramount issue in this case is the CPSC’s argument that warnings don’t work, alleging that “No warnings or instructions could be devised that would effectively communicate the [ingestion] hazard so that the warnings and instructions could be understood and heeded by consumers to reduce the number of magnet ingestion incidents.” (Second Amended Complaint, ¶ 89)  This issue alone makes an influential case with vast implications, as warnings are the traditional method used to encourage public safety."
A warning on the carrying case or package would be similar to the warnings on cigarette boxes. Not every cig as a warning, but everyone (including children) know that cigarettes are bad for you. A young child wouldn't know cigarettes are dangerous just by looking at them, it's something that they're taught. 
" When confronted about balloons having a greater incident rate than magnet spheres while sharing similar warning attributes, Adler says “we should be looking at balloons [too.]” "
It seems like their targeting magnets since they don't appeal to a broad audience and the companies don't have a ton of money to fight back. It's bizarre that as an adult, I can't play with magnets but I can spend a weekend firing fully automatic weapons and claim it's my right.

Before your post, I had no idea that magnets were being targeted by the CPSC. I decided to buy some to support the company, and because fuck the government for saying consumers are too stupid to read warnings.

I'm kinda in that boat. All my cryptos are local but 'lost' somewhere in a maze of files. With all the forks and applications and wallets and block chain data needed to get up to date, it's just too much effort, especially if you're not getting paid to do it. 
Would rather have it online so I don't mess up anything but don't trust most online spots. So I stopped participating in crypto stuff altogether lol.
