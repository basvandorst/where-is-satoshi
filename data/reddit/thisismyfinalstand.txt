I've got a much more original joke for you but it's still waiting to be processed.

but if your crack house is busted and you happened to be in the crack house with cash, pretty sure it'd be seized.

That has been freshly formatted and recently had the operating system installed from a known good, tested clean source. 
10btc is a lot.

Thank you for your reply! Any exchange you'd recommend that allows US based individuals?
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:34:03
Thank you! 
Looked into Bittrex, in case anyone else was curious, they don't allow AK, AR, CA, CT, FL, HI, ID, IA, KS, KT, LA, MD, MI, MS, NC, ND, NE, NH, NV, OH, OK, PA, SD, TX, VT, VA, WA, WY, and PR.
Lookin' into HitBTC now. - Looks like it allows my state! hurray! Thanks! Wonder if its worth verifying before I start trading or if it's safe to stay unverified...
2nd edit: aaaand this is where i realize I'm in over my head. lol

Hahaha yeah those pesky altcoins... So many of them, though. Which ones, exactly, have a place beside the king? Asking for a friend.

Yeah those damn pesky lesser known coins, the ones you can't just buy on coinbase and shit... Those pesky lesser known coins, which ones do you invest in, like specifically, I mean there are so many. Thanks

Okay, I'll bite. How is it okay? I mean, the federal budget isn't likely funding a project to turn the $1 trillion deficit into $200bil/month for the next 5 years like the completely fictitious anecdote above. How is a government running on a negative budget a good thing? If it happens year after year, eventually that money has to be paid back. Sure, a government's budget isn't as black and white and simple as the average family budget, but budgeting is budgeting, isn't it, and being in the red is pretty universally bad in budgeting... Why isn't it a bad thing that US government has to borrow money in order to operate? Shouldn't our government be able to operate within whatever it taxes? What could we possibly be 'investing' in that will outweigh the interest for loans in the trillion? 
Whatever your reasoning, wouldn't it be better if it operated within its finances?
