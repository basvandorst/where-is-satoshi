Jeff of Uptrennd here.   
I was not aware of any of this.  
Doing some DD now, to see if it's true, and I'd love to hop on a call with you.

Seems we remember different stories. 
Did you also "Wash your hands clean" with the Bomb team? 
Or did something else happen ;)

Withdrawal was already live for a few weeks and so users had an opportunity to withdraw. They were free to sell. That is where the pressure is from.
The rest of what your saying is a subjective speculation that has tangible evidence against.

The team has already been paid the tokens for the work they've done. We are all holding. This is verifiable on Etherscan. 
Once we changed the token contract address, it was explicitly stated on our website which exchanges to use.

Let's cut to it, in a 100% factual manner:  
Rachel has NEVER worked for Uptrennd.  
The only two people from the team who have sold tokens are Ben Leff and Tiffany Gyles, who we both had to fire for poor performance. This is easily verifiable on etherscan.  
We WERE listed on sistemkoin, but then had to reissue tokens under a different contract address.  
This is easily verifiable on etherscan.  
So our listing was nullified, and we wanted to list elsewhere as our sistemkoin experience was substandard.

This is a fair point that if tokens do not equal points, then that's a scam.   
However, Withdrawal and Deposits will be live this week
