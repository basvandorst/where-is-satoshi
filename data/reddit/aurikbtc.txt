Im a huge supporter of segwit, but still not sure if UASF is the right way to activate it.
If we get to that point i will upgrade my node accordingly to support it, but I will not support this idea publicly bevor the core-developers do so.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:13:30
EDIT: Turns out, that Antpool usa just mined a Core-Block.
Block Number 458807
EDIT 2: Seems that this pool (usa 0) was never signaling BU... Block 458,655 and Block 458,570 are also Core. Not updated to BU yet?

Dam i KNEW it! 
Remember when he said
“Since our system cannot build C++11, I would like put this on hold for a while, until we can get our new servers online up and running,” Chun said. “Next spring, maybe.”
If I got this right, he wasnt talking about "next spring" but  "next april", in reference to hk agreement...
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:10:18
It is principle possible, but hard to implement. 
It would be this way: You generate 21 Addresses with a need of 11 to sign a transaction. You then combine multiple addresses to one address of the given weight. (eg. combine 2 to get A2 (10%) or 8 to get A1 (40%). 
The implementation had to use P2SH, and an additional script might be necessary who manages the 5 "master-addresses" (A1-A5), each of them stands for a given number of the basic 21 addresses.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:12:12
Yes but you are not supporting the network then. Its a node just for you in this case
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:20:41
yep, my bad!
Corrected my post above.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:21:57
The confirmation depends on the workload of the network. I cannot predict the future, but i would guess that they both will confirm until next Monday (this is normally the day with the lowest mempool). There is a good chance (but definitely no guarantee) that they will get confirmed then. If you ask me, I would say there is a 90% chance that the 70sat/byte tx gets through and a 50% chance for the 20s/b
If they dont, you have three options:
1) Use the "RBF" = "Replace by fee" option or
2) Double spend it (clear all unconfirmed tx), then spend it again.
3) Use the "Child pays for Adult" mechanism, by spending the unconfirmed output with a very very high fee (500 sat/byte) (so a miner sees it as a price for including both at ones (he can not get the high fee without including the parent tx first)
Each of this options require more detailed explanation, if you get to that point, u can google for it or ask here again
@_date: 2017-03-31 21:15:42
Well we will see... Could also imagine he will continue to vote for both SW and BU and stay neutral this way. Or he will stop signaling on litecoin again tomorrow (wasnt even awar, thanks for bringing it up to my attention). But then again, as he changes his policy in litecoin just today reinforce my opinion, that he will change something after today in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:11:01
We will see. Can be both good or bad. Depends on how much people (economy) will follow
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:45:30
As far as it might be true for RBF, you still should be able to export your private keys and use them in any other wallet of your choice (or even blockchain.info), and then again you can use Option 2 or 3.

Make sure all your nodes are reachable from  to confirm that no firewall or router is blocking it. Had the same problem my self, but with port-forwarding (tcp 8333) it is now working. Please make sure that yours reachable from outside! Just check it with the link.

Might be, yes. But i think not because of the 1. April, but because of the April in general he might change his voting-policy now. Kind of afraid he will start signaling BU (only) from now.

@_date: 2017-04-24 22:29:35
Seems like it is confirmed now :) 
For the future: Just have a look at how many tx are in the transactionpool bevor sending bitcoins. As already proposed,  is a good site to get an idea of a proper fee too. Most of the time, 220 Sat/Byte should be enough for a confirmation within the next few hours. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:52:25
A site for what? You can use the proposed site for fee calculation from UK too, dont you?
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:19:12
Agreed. Lets try to avoid any attacks for the next time and downvote them together when they appear. Regardless on who they aim on.

Hey out there, 
this are my thoughts on "Larawith.me" ( which is an Investment opportunity that offers 3% daily dividends lifetime(!) on every invest.
First off: Yes, i do think of it as a ponzi-sheme. No seriously company can afford to pay 3% daily for ever. 
But: This must not mean, that u can not use it to make money!
Like every other ponzi-sheme, it might stay up for quite a while and as you are break even after just 33 days, there might be more then enough time to get some money out of it. Keep in mind, that even if it breaks bevor this 33 days, u will not suffer a 100% loss, as it is highly unlikely that its going to broke right in the first day you invested. 
On top of it u can compare it with other ponzi-shemes: The average running time for such a sheme is something near 6 Month. Larawith.me is just running for about 2 Month. On top of it, it is very easy to use and opens it up for a large number of people. And most important: The feature that u can not withdraw your initial investment makes it unpossible to create a sudden panic in which everyone just withdraw all the money. Instead u get your 3% daily based and most people just reinvest them, so in my mind the sytem will stay up for much longer then the average ponzi-sheme. 
So, what opportunity do we have? If the system will stay up for just another 3 Month, u already get 300% of every dollar/btc u invest in. If it lives longer (and i can imagine it to be up for a year maybe), well, then its even better. And if im wrong, and this for some miracle is not a ponzi-sheme at all, well, im getting rich then ;) (But yes, it must be a ponz-sheme, otherwise too good to be true)
If u wanna give it a shot, try out. But please be very carefully and do not invest large numbers in it. Im with it for a month now, reaching the break-even point in 2 days from now. And as this is highly likely a ponzi sheme, pls do not make the mistake and reinvest money for too long. Keep in mind that it must break eventually. 
Closing out, just one thing to say: IF u consider investing, please make sure to set me as your upline, so i will get some money for affiliation. U can contact me here to claim them, im perfecly fine to give the money back to you, as im not intend this review to make money out of your investments. But ofc, if u want u can just set me up and thank me with the referal bonus. U do not have any disadvantages doing so. 
To put me up as your upline, just go to "Menu" =&gt; "Earnings" =&gt; "My team" =&gt; "Set my Upline" =&gt; And then put up the Number "268675556". In case u dont want to claim it for your self, I will keep the bonus as a gift and a "Thanks" for this review :)

This is the official board for armory. They can probably help you better.
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:33:33
Have tested it with my own Armory Wallet: Got the same problem, but could fix it easily by clicking on "Signer: Default" and selecting the "c++" signer manually in the transaction-review field (just bevor you have to enter your passphrase). 
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:08:29
Well, its probably better then signaling NYA, but its not as good as F2pool for example, not just because of the smaller hashrate but because they dont support 1x eigher. 
I guess they will go with Bcash only from there. And if they mine on other chains, they will stick with 2x
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:13:50
This. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:31:11
To answer this is up to you, i just want to point out that their decision to stop signal 2x does not mean they will support 1x.
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:29:57
Just wow :( 
Such a disappointment :(((
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:21:28
The absolute amount of fee doesnt matter, you always have to calculate the fee/byte. You have about 50sat/b, you would need about 200sat/byte for a fast tx. 
Your transaction is a very large one as u have 34 inputs. So 0,003 is just too less. It would be more then enough for a "normal" small tx.
@_date: 2017-05-07 19:55:41
Just wow. Such a disappointment. So sad now :(
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:54:45
Ok, got it wrong then, all right :) 
Btw: I own litecoins my self.
Still, my question stays unanswerd. But i guess noone rly knows :p
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:59:17
Guess what? I "might" have heard about it already. 
My question was whether you think that this changes in hashpower is just variance or because they are real long-term changes
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:09:16
A correct statistical analysis shows that the probability of BIP 91 activating this period is 0.73116 or 73.1%. (Block 476706).
*Correct means, that there are no made assumptions about the hashrate (because noone really knows), instead the percentage of signaling blocks so far is taken as the probability of a block signaling or not.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:39:25
Update as of Block 476710:
Probability is 0.8598 or 85.98%
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:54:53
You too can feel this pure satisfaction, when Judas is actually forced to signal SW? 
Must have been quite painfull for him.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:24:27
You have to see BIP91 and BIP141 as indipendent.
0x200000X0 &lt;&lt; The "X" bit signaling BIP91
0x2000000X &lt;&lt; This is signaling BIP141.
0x20000012 is both BIP91 and BIP141
0x20000002 is BIP141
0x20000010 is BIP91
0x20000000 is None
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:27:17
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:24:11
You are right, I just made a Probability Analysis, because even if 90% of the Hashpower would signal, they could get unlucky and miss the 80%. So i guess its nice to run the numbers and look at the Probability. I took the 80.5% since the Period started as a 80.5% chance of each block to signal, and used a binomial calculator to calculate for 60 out of 77. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:53:32
My question was of scientific nature, so im just interested if there could be any reasons for a transaction like this. 
No spam-calling, scaling debate or whatever. And yes, right now this is ofc a legit tx.
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:36:42
U got me wrong. but as to u it would be 22 words + one password + checksumword if u want to. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:51:44
As i said, u got me wrong. I knew that it doesnt work this way. This was just a help to imagine the security offered by 24 words (without a password).
Its the same as it would be with 23 + pw. But again: Just an example for better imagination, not the reality.
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:05:49
In Bitcoins :p 
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:55:55
Take it this way: U have to guess 23 words, the last word is the password. Thinking this way, u "may" (i know, u wount, but just for explanation) guess "someones" 23 words right, but then again u still need the last "password". 
Hopefully this will help, our brains are not made to handle this large numbers (or small ones, if u take the chance to guess right)
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:24:46
12 + both E.C. (=14)
I was wrong with "4" and "18", can someone explain me this? With "18" i was very confident about the answer being "True"... I know the other way around it would be true ("Each address can have multiple private keys" =&gt; True), but i thought u only get one address from each priv.key? 
Srsly false?
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:02:37
It is! Just recently they released 0.96, a fully segwit compatible version.
