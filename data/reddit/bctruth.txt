Keep in mind that any trades between Gox accounts never showed up in the blockchain... so they could theoretically add as many GoxCoins as they want to their platform and no one would know.
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:29:24
You actually came to same conclusion I did (with some minor differences)... It's only a matter of time until this is proven right
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:15:31
No... the crash in December... 
You don't have to listen to me... just keep buying more Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:08:53
If BitCoins had a fixed value... every business in the world would accept it... the same way they take Visa and MC
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:44:40
Look... no free market based on any sort of logic behaves like BitStamps price chart... the reason people keep buying as the price goes up is because they think other people are buying it up... when in reality, the price is just being inflated by 2 bots trading back and forth...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:37:07
I said in circulation... you just admitted Satoshi controls 10%... that's a lot...
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:04:45
That's what I've been saying for weeks!
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:13:51
Sorry... my timing was off... it's happening now.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:04:17
When you bought your BitCoins... you gave your money to someone... didn't you?
I mean your Dollars
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:07:06
Watch the BitCoin price chart for 5 minutes and tell me that bots aren't controlling the price on BitStamp: 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:19:54
It's the illusion of a free market... 90% of Bitcoins were mined before the general public started buying in... Price of a stock or commodity can easily be controlled... that's why we have REGULATORS...
If I could control the price of BitCoin, it would be in my best interest to drive it up right now too... Free Market logic dictates the price should be dropping
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:19:15
Yup... I've been saying that since it happened.
The market is not regulated... they use bots to keep the price high... there is no reason it would go from $400 to $600 overnight after a huge drop.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:11:10
Watch the price... 2 bots trade back and forth in small enough intervals to slowly move the price up and down... I know this because there are trades for about 10 seconds... then a pause until the next minute..
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:51:16
And... here we go....
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:34:19
It's not trolls... people are so blinded by greed they can't see the bigger picture...
The CEOs control most of the BitCoins... if BitCoin drops, they lose all the equity they have in it... so it makes sense for people to give up a portion to keep the economy running...
Once the government steps in next week, we'll see it drop and stabilize... My theory is a flat $100 per coin...
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:44:23
100% Right... Bots are controlling the price....
BitCoin became an accidental pyramid scheme... the BitCoin foundation started selling their coins (worth nothing at the time) for $1,200... and became instant millionaires...
If BitCoin loses all it's value, they lose their fortune... which they don't deserve...
Bitcoin is a PAYMENT SYSTEM... and needs to have a fixed value!

@_date: 2014-02-27 04:48:02
Because $1,000 is about the average value people paid...
Think of BitCoin like a gift card.... people paid money for them, and they have value, but they can only spend it within the "Bitcoin Network"... The fact that no retailer retains the BitCoin they get and convert it to Fiat right away is the perfect example...
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:14:27
Why do you think most people don't insider trade on the stock market?... It's not out of the goodness of their hearts...
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:41:46
$550 at time of original post...I'll be back in a few min once it pops... stay tuned
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:50:46
The best interest of the exchanges is that the price remains high and people continue to trade it...
If the price drops to nothing, the exchanges go out of business...

Did you ever wonder why BTC-e's price always trails Bitstamp's???
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:40:49
No... he said he called the multiple crashes
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:19:28
This wallet received 181 BTC YESTERDAY that were part of the 755,000 stolen
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:35:34
Since November 2011 when I first read this article.... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:12:56
Nope... The bots stopped trading less than an hour ago... notice how the price stopped moving and volume dropped by 99%... just long enough to prepare for a sell off...
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:36:25
$570... up to $590 nowish
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:04:02
The prices constantly fluctuate.... that's how they make their money, but the higher it goes, the more people buy into the pyramid... and they buy the coins from....
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:39:29
American Government... They are trying to save you all from yourselves...
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:44:00
Stay tuned...
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:17:36
Looks like the trades stopped...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:24:55
Who do they buy them from?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:46:25
I actually LOL'd... well played
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:06:10
What about the MILLIONS of BitCoins that were mined in the beginning?... Who do you think controls them?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:01:50
Not the miners... the guys all involved with Shrem and the other CEOs... they became CEOs because they have the most BitCoins... if the value drops to 0, their BitCoins are worthless...
They basically decided to start selling their BitCoins for $1,200... and people were dumb enough to pay... The money isn't gone...it's in the pockets on the exchanges who you BOUGHT the coins from...
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:29:29
It's a simple trading program that any Finance major could build... the reason the stock market is regulated is because it's easy to manipulate if you control a large portion of the available stock (or bitcoins)
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:40:03
Or they make the price look artificially high... so people keep buying in hoping to make back the money they lost...
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:54:58
My timing is a bit off... I was looking at a 3 min chart... so be patient... it will climb and FAST...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:34:33
Simple solution.... Fixed price.
1 BTC=$1,000.... the actual fiat exists within the ecosystem already
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:29:40
Yes... of course... because the 1% of people who control most of the Bitcoins in circulation wouldn't benefit from a high price in any way... right?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:57:58
I watched all the trades on BitWisdom... it was bots trading back and forth that bought the price up.... It's an unregulated market... there's no one to stop them from doing it
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:21:12
And how does CoinBase sell you BitCoins.... unless they OWN A LOT OF THEM...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:12:51
How do you know that Satoshi isn't the 5 exchange CEOs... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:45:43
My percentages may be off... but my logic is sound...
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:36:31
Or... the CEOs who control 99% of the bitcoins need to keep the value up... so they are putting more money back into the market to keep it alive.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:27:40
The CEOs all control a huge percentage of the BitCoins in circulation... Everyone else is part of the 99%...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:28:41
Story checks out... nothing to see here... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:33:30
Wow... you found one of the double spend accounts... AMAZING!...
Blockchain even has a warning!
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:52:42
It's not a theory... I literally watch the chart all day at work... strange amounts appear and disappear and it pauses every 30 seconds so the trade volume appears in the next minute... just look at the minute by minute candlesticks...
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:48:53
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:20:09
By trading in small increments in increasing prices... the price slowly goes up... then occasionally you'd see a huge spike in volume driving the price up.. and then a small trade bringing it back down...
I'm not forcing people to believe me... I'm just trying to help people who have had the wool pulled over the eyes and can't see the truth..
Here's video explaining it...
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:22:37
Looks like the bots broke...
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:58:25
You get it now? It's a Ponzi scheme... you paid Mark... and he said "Look how much I made you, do you want to cash out or re-invest the profit?"... 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:38:43
The US Government didn't steal it from him... he stole it from you by selling you bitcoins at $1,200... the government is holding it to pay back all the people scammed...
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:30:18
I see all trading halted... what about you?
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:02:56
If anything it's one of the early investors selling off...
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:11:56
The Stock Market is a free market too... except insider trading and price manipulation is regulated
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:45:02
Shhh... don't tell anyone tho
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:33:17
Who are you? Your 
theory is correct... 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:03:10
Wait.... some people got BitCoins for $1 each??? then what the hell would make them worth $1,200 to someone else?
Tulip Mania--- There, I said it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:46:17
Like :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:10:08
Thanks for the correction... and the vast majority of US BitCoins were purchased from Mt.Gox
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:26:26
Ya... it's bots... it's what was happening all weekend on Mt. Gox...
The trades are WAY too high frequency and they are designed to move the price... low volume, then wait 1 minute... then another order... then a series of huge orders...
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:45:56
Check out this wallet... $3.3 Billion ($3,321,129,254.11)...
