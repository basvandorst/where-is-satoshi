Value is in the eye of the beholder.

Isn't it better if the future of Bitcoin will depend on robust principals, good services and people who actually can benefit from - not just from the speculation?

It is considered that about 30-40% of Bitcoins are lost and about 78% of them have not been involved in a transaction for years (because they are lost, forgotten or just kept for a different sake).

The "S" curve is related to the natural growth of populations. That also explains why the BTC volatility is much higher then the volatility of gold. Simply the population holding gold is much bigger and diverse then the population of BTC owners. The difference boils down to the reaction times of the transactions; Bitcoin can lose fast and gain fast thanks to its nature. 
Btw why are people so interested in the value of 1 BTC instead of the whole market cap and the size of the market? It is just about the scale we use to measure the success of Bitcoin. In terms of 1 satoshi would be the articles that attractive?

Many people discuss if an intrinsic value is important for a currency. But I have not yet read an article about BTC discussing the issue when corn is used for speculations. It started the revolutions in the Arab countries because the price of corn was too high. And seriously you really want to melt gold to forks/jewellery? How many investors are concerned about the "physical backing"?
