Makes you wonder if they really still hold all of the customers bitcoin or if they 'invested' some of it thinking they could return it later. Now that everyone wants their coin out, they just don't have it. I really don't see anything stopping them from buying up all their customers cheap sell orders since no one else will be buying them.

Ahh nice. I was about to try it and actually had it installed when I found out it was in the normal appstore. Then I read the note about the apps and went back to the Cydia one. I'll probably just stick with this one until they actually add something new to the one in the appstore that isn't in this version.

Well in that case I will have to give it a try. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from buying them. You just have to think of it more like a stock and not an investment that's guaranteed to pay itself off. 
I guess I was just trying to think of it in comparison to buying mining hardware myself which isn't very comparable.
Oh and thanks for the tip! Being a broke as like I am, that was a very nice surprise to wake up to. It still blows my mind that someone was able to integrate Bitcoin into reddit comments like this without support from reddit devs.
I officially own 4 shares of tat.asicminer. If nothing else it makes it much more interesting to watch the market.

Escrow can be *supported* directly by the blockchain; however, the blockchain itself will not be able to decide which party would get the funds in case of dispute. A third party or possibly judge would need to decide that.

Except that is a 2 year old quote... from Wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:58:09
Couldn't they have two wallets both with the same private key imported? Send an amount to the seller with a very low transaction price and then send the amount to their self using the other wallet and a higher transaction fee.
Or is it even possible to have the same private key in 2 wallets?
@_date: 2013-05-24 04:35:12
Yeah, no thanks. I'm sure my math is wrong somewhere but this is what I did. 
    25BTC are mine every 10 minutes which equals 3600 per day.
    (1440*25)/10=3600btc/day
    According to blockchains hash distribution, asicminer accounts
    for 8% of what has been mined in the last 4 days.
[Hashrate Distribution](
    8% of total daily mined coins is around 288 coins per day.
    .08*3600=288btc/day
    This means without counting any fees, a tat.asicminer share 
    would pay 0.0000072btc per day.
    288/40000000=0.0000072btc/day
    At the current value of 0.02443 per tat.asicminer share, it would 
    take 9.3 years for a share to pay itself off at current rates.
    0.02443/0.0000072=9.3years
[tat.asicminer trades](
Now obviously these are trades so your really just putting value on the speculation that the price will rise. Also no one knows what bitcoin will due tomorrow let alone where asicminer will be in 9 years. Either way, to risky for my bones. I better just stick to my GPU mining while it's still somewhat profitable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:07:46
Seems like this would benefit the system as a whole if exchanges set a min/buy sell. Today was however very profitable for mtgox by have a lot of transactions. Hell they were probably the biggest benefactor in this crash.

What happens if the scam artist doesn't agree to sign? The 3rd party acts as a safety net in case the 2 parties can't come to an agreement. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:41:29
You would still need to give the 3rd key to a 3rd party to decide who would get the funds in cases of a dispute. This isn't something that can be solved by programming.

That is still true but only after you are able to convert your cash to bitcoin. There is no reason multiple markets for different types of players can't exist.

Hopefully someone who is actually for bitcoin speaks today.

What evidence do they have of what sort of Mining 'he' could be doing? It could be one guy with a descent GPU or it could be a super sexy rich bastard with a huge Mining farm. Without know what 'he' is running, there is no way of knowing how much bitcoin was created. 
Also just another thought, if one person created the original blockchain, would it be possible to put information in there that could give an individual an untold sum of money. Meaning could have just given himself 2 million coins to start without anyone knowing the wiser?

If you say you earned $100 million by mining, you have to pay taxes on it.  If you just did $100 million in currency exchange then you pay nothing. 
I have to wonder if something like the US government could be involved although I have no idea what their intent would be or really any reason to think this. 
Here is my completely uneducated conspracy theory; A large entity is using the power of mining to create the largest rainbow table ever known to man.

Both ways went very smoothly.
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:21:42
Yeah, I guess originally I had understood it as more as 100 people going in together for an ASIC Miner and splitting the money. Now I get that it is really more like having stock in the company.
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:20:20
I guess what I am wondering is what does 1/100th of an asicminer share equate to? I guess another way to ask this is, how many shares are out there in total?

Does transferring it through that many addresses really help? Or is it a case where the money is automatically being transferred at set intervals so its harder to find? Just seems that with the blockchain being public and all, it wouldn't be all that much extra work to follow the chain.

I've recently started GPU mining. Since I have nothing invested into it currently, I really don't have much to lose and plan on keeping them for the  long hall. As far as I know right now, BTC could be worth thousands in the years ahead. Of course it could also crash down to 0 tomorrow but that just puts me where I started.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:37:25
Whatever you do, make sure you quickly transmit that sort of funds to a secure cold wallet quickly. I wouldn't trust any web wallet with that sort of funds for long.
@_date: 2013-05-29 03:23:43
The cydia ones says 1.9.9 and the appstore one says 1.9.8. i don't really know if this means it's newer as it could be slightly different versioning. Just don't try to install them both or funny things will happen.
    To activate the full wallet feature:
    1. Setup or access a wallet on blockchain.info/wallet from your computer.
    2. Connect your iPhone to the internet via the same IP address that you accessed the wallet on your computer from.
    3. Install the block chain app.
    4. The app will have full wallet functionality.  Create a new account,  or pair it with an existing one.
   
    If you don't follow the steps above,  it will only allow you to view bitcoin transactions.

So mtgox.com isn't protected by cloudflare? I wonder if this has to do with not being able to make an A record point to a hostname. Seems it would make more since if that's the case to have an external site forward you to the cloudflare site. Maybe they are already doing this though.
