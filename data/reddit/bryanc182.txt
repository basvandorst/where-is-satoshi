This helped, thanks!  I was sure that by using latest version of core, I already have the benefits of creating segwit walllets from gui. Now, the thing that I still don't completely understand it this lightning network, which should also drive the fee costs down. Do i have to have a special wallet address to use it? Does bitcoin core support it already?

Not even a small percentage of those, who buy the cheapest alt crypto they can find - because - it still has way to grow from few cents...

Another question... I have been hearing two conflicting things... 1. Users running full node + LN software will be able to "stake" their bitcoins in a what might be understood a "PoS" manner, and get fee reward for doing so.... 2. Fees in LN will be zero.   .... So, how does this two go together? Will users that want to actively participate in LN  really be able to earn some bitcoins doing so? Will this be infinitely small amounts?

Tulips did not have the potential to change the world. 
And dotcom bubble was same - bunch of investors jumping on a bandwagon they did not even understand and bought into companies that did not even have a business plan...
I can not see relevance of these past events to the bitcoin.

Was shown this by a colleague.... Did not know how to respond/debunk it. So, ideas?
