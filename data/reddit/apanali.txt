Here's my take on it. Bitcoin will be the operating system of internet money. It will be THE storage of value. LN will be the layer that enables us to trade that stored value fast, secure and cheap. Altcoins on the other hand will co-exist to solve specific applications - whether it's a blockchain for image rights, dentists whatever. Their tokens will be used the keep their blockchain running. But altcoins will always be converted to/from Bitcoin if value is to be inserted or extracted from/to other chains. More bullish than ever on BTC.

You're right - you're using it right in this. It's me that want Core and Bitcoin to be in the same sentence as little as possible for reasons previously mentioned. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:30:25
Step in right direction. KFC, Twitch - list will grow. LN will help. This is Amazon testing the waters of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:09:52
But that's what they practically are - if their value comes from converting bitcoin. Just like we trade oil in USD altcoins 
 will be trades with BTC

Will pop up somewhere else - like Sweden. Huge investments in data centers due to cold weather and beneficial tax cuts on electricity. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:51:47
Well written!
Like you say - you're entitled to your own opinion. Would also all - but not your own facts.
Don't like you write Core all the time - this is for me a capitulation to the other side. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:38:24
Yes, read about investors want to get in again after KNCMiner bankrupted. Also, the price and subsidized electricity makes it attractive again.

Hi! Whatever coins you sell you should be able to prove the purchase price and thereby date. Therefore keep all your sales orders / receipts. You dont need to show the transactions between wallets. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:47:49
I think your charts prove my point. In late Nov. We climbed from 3 to 4,75 tx/s. Today we're at 3.25 and seems like we're going down. Meanwhile hash rate of network has gone up. Fewer TX + more hash power = cheaper TX.
Never saw this as an issue though. Scaling on chain isn't and will never be the solution for fast and cheap TX. This is just the most sophisticated and secure way to store value. Transactions is built on a separate layer.

It went down as quick as it went up. Not sure what's going on there. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:52:42
Fewer transactions and falling price is due to the cooled appetite for BTC atm among new adopters. I bet you have the pattern among your friends as I do. 2 months ago everyone was all in with shiny new Ledgers and Trezors. Buying, storing, buying storing. Now they have accumulated and are maybe in doubt to buy more. Others consider them pros now and think the BTC train has left. Instead of getting into BTC they get into all different shitcoins which they btw try to sell to me. That's why we have falling prices and less transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:29:52
Just in time - spent my Bitcoin Gold fork coins on shitcoins. What happens? Shitcoins down and BTC up. Thank me later, 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:33:52
Definitely not coinbase. In my opinion this is completely decoupled from exchanges. For LN were looking at retailers. Amazon or some big player needs to step up and accept Bitcoin with LN  
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:42:44
What I don't understand is the following? Are we solving transaction times and fees by not using the underlying technology of BTC? Basically BTC will just "fuel" a completely different network? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:34:59
DON'T CALL IT BITCOIN CORE. IT'S BITCOIN. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:16:23
Just to clarify - i don't agree it's a bubble. I think the point of open-source, decentralizon, protocols. I think this is totally in line with the future of bitcoin. Internet of money.

Always have a good laugh when looking at these Technical analyses. Someone should make a meme of these - someone drawing lines in Paint, ready for wall street
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:05:45
Cool stuff for a great cause! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:28:19
As a true BTC believer I am entitled to say this. The transactions are NOT dropping due to Segwit. They're dropping due to less transactions. The hype is going down compared to Thanksgiving - Xmas. New people got in and experimented. Now some of them lost interest - due to price and correction. Others are shifting to ETH and altcoins. That's where the volumes are now.
Overall i am happy with this. Gives developers more peace to work on important stuff while the altcoin house is burning. Also great opportunity to accumulate more coins for us that are in long-term 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:16:02
Ok, should have seen that based on your nickname

Can we give him the name Shitcoin Jesus

I see. But looking at this it makes me a bit worried and optimistic. Adding 150b value on pure speculation can't end well. If/when it corrects how will it affect BTC? My takeaway is that this surge in market cap can be seen as future BTC value. Basically, money flowing into different coins, one corrects and pull the rest, people panic and gets back to 'safe' BTC. What do you think?
Looking at this this would value BTC at roughly $27,000 today.

Cleaned up my Mac and ready to go - will look into your suggesrtion as a long term solution

@_date: 2017-11-13 10:02:22
It's complicated, slow, fragmented, expensive. Basically all the traits disruptive innovations brings with it. Once this gets sorted we're rdy for mass adoption and real price hikes. So be thankful it's like this now - it means you're early to the party. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:49:04
Go for it! Have it ready to pull the trigger when you're ready

That meme is so 2017
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:30:24
Funny! Had the same thought 2 days ago 
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:34:23
Yes. More interest from public and easier to buy (like square app) 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:00:37
But how is a cold wallet tied to myself? It cannot be proved - or? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:11:21
Technical analysis is completely **irrelevant** since it doesn't take news into account whatsoever. Another article citing a high profile banker will break your predicted pattern. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:11:34
Correct. Basically, yes I claim I bought something. Then when I send it back I claim I sold something and then immediately exhnaged (no gain). 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:20:00
Is it possible to track one coin or fraction of a coin? In my mind tracing it wouldn't be possible since one can generate wallet addresses - correct? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:09:16
Buying and selling on different exchanges won't do the trick. Cold wallets in between would imo. Trying to understand what I'm missing. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:25:05
If your tax residence is Germany - all gains are TAX FREE if you've held the Bitcoins for more than 1 year. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:41:57
If that would be the case - then a paperwallet would fix that issue. Tracking wallet owners wont work. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:54:55
Isn't a ban of ICO (altcoins) actually a good thing for Bitcoin. The regulations would help push for a standard - globally. Basically the governments who are trying to control it by legislation are actually shooting themselves in the foot here? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:11:33
If it gets banned in a country and there's money to be made - exchanges, miners etc will move. If not themselves others will be happy to fill the vacuum. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:00:46
That's another thing. Could place off-shore or something. Main thing is to understand if I can remove the ties between the bitcoins and myself. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:03:33
If you got in to get rich quick - sorry but you won't find that anywhere. Unless you're on Wall Street.
Go back and watch **Banking on Bitcoin** once again on Netflix. Watch "**Bitcoin The end of money as we know it"**. Read Bitcoin **The Internet of Money**. 
Take some time and understand again what's wrong with money as we know it today and why Bitcoin is to replace it. Why it exists. How it can exists. Why the time is now.
Please share some good reads or movies that can remind us who were fighting with this remarkable technology and why. Please don't post any price predictions etc. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:09:12
This is the best news ever! Sad to see that people are struggling - but bitcoins adoption will come from counties like Zimbabwe. They will simply leap into the future w/o banks not cause they want to but have to.
