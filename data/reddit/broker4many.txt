Could you maybe make that easier to understand. I really don't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:07:38
Haha. This seems like a joke that went over my head, but I always speak normal on phone and in person. I just tend to type fast on computer.

I don't know where you are getting that because he has euros. So, it definitely isn't francs or elsewhere

How would I get in contact with those people/companies as well.
@_date: 2019-03-23 06:12:10
Alright I understand. I meant waiting for a response from Otc companies but not you guys. Do you have a link to a better forum.

I was just helping. I don't have anything invested in this scenario. Still need clarification from the other guy because dealership likely would not accept 200,000 cash, but how would buying that much worth of bitcoin help.

Yes bitcoin. Still need clarification from the first guy because things don't make sense. A dealership likely wouldn't accept 200,000 euros, the bank wouldn't let deposit that much, so it doesn't make sense to get bitcoins. He should have just been able to write a cashier's check or something.

I have contacted the majority of those mentions to surprisingly a few replies. Trigon X seems to be the front runner to complete a deal since they responded, and they plan on calling the guy.

I appreciate the help, but I don't think you understand. I don't have anything and won't be sent anything. His words when I told him of online transfer," I don't need that By transfer I can buy everywhere in the world, by cash its difficult, for this I need help. To which I replied, "I am trying but why something more complicated when transferring is much easier and could try to set up buying bitcoins like me and tony discussed." To which he then replied, " if we are talking about wire/bank transfer I don't need help, if we are talking about cash also bitcoin is a good way, so I need help just if we are talking about cash.

Looked already into a few from the list and a response similar to this. I really need a response.

Sorry for getting annoyed. Grammer police always bother me. I changed it even though I put location Switzerland. The gold had to do with buying a huracan because that was the original deal, but he needed help with something else. As for the next two points, I don't know. I will have to ask. His bank wouldn't let him deposit, but it doesn't make sense what buying bitcoins was going to do. As for the last point, I don't get the reference because it isn't true. Francs are his preference I am guessing.

I had a subject, verb, and predicate Mrs. Jeed.

I get your concern, but I am just setting things up, and we already agreed upon a commission by wiring through like Paypal.
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:17:17
Don't get into that. Waste of time and money.
