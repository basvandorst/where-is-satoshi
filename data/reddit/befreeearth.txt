Personally I don't really like Ripple, just weird feeling from their developers and don't like that it's centralized but their confirmation times are equal to that of visa which is something bitcoin needs to do to continue to be a contender in crypto. It seems as though bitcoin cash is faster with lower transaction speeds, but are they less secure than bitcoin? N iv'e been hearing about the lightning network for the past few years and how they'll make transactions and confirmations almost instant have you heard anything about when it will be officially launched, I for the life of me haven't been able to find even a good estimate of its release date.

I do think blockchain is the solution to many problems such as SWIFT and everything like that, but I do agree that humans normally like to go in the path of least resistance, and trying to converge to a singular currency is a huge task. I noticed that the volume for bitcoin is only at like 5 billion to even get close to becoming a full on replacement it would have to be handle the same amount of transfers and volume as the forex market, and besides the number of the transaction the volume is often in the trillions of dollars a day. I do see crypto being very useful in the coming years once they have firms that will offer instant transactions from crypto to fiat, but i think eventually their volatility will eventually become the same as most currency pairs and most speculation will need leverage or large lot sizes to make it suitable for day trading.

Possibly, what do you think is going to happen?

I believe in blockchain technology, but the scale-ability of bitcoin was dismal, and has been outdone by several altcoins which are faster, more capable, and most importantly scale-able.

I believe a decentralized medium is best for global currency, but ripple is starting to make waves with banks due to it's capability to compete with the number of transactions per second as visa. Once they are able to link it to fiat and viotility isn't as much an issue I think they're going to start making huge moves until there is greater competition.

If bitcoin is going to rise now would be the time to buy, but in my opinion sometime in 2019, or 2020 the altcoins with greater purposes, and better speed are going to take over the crypto market cap and leave bitcoin behind unless the lightning work is perfected, and bitcoin visa cards become mainstream. Currently though it doesn't look like bitcoin is going to be able to compete.

I'm just wondering how people think the lightning network is going to compare to say bitcoin cash, and ripple which are way faster and cost significantly less to transfer than bitcoin. I also heard that there are still features that bitcoin has that aren't being used, I saw here the other day that someone sent the first video on bitcoin. Are there any technological advancements that are in bitcoins core that may show up that will make it comparable to ethereum?  but no i didn't mean specifically like fiat ones like Tether, just a generalization.

Wow, thanks for such a well though out reply. I really value the information. I didn't realize that there were only 5.8 million holders. 
I view it the same as you where I feel like the 2nd generation coins are going to take over, I feel like bitcoin will still be around for the next coming years, but if we ever move to a a singular decentralized currency, idt it's going to be bitcoin.
Crypto might all just disappear if fiat gets supported by blockchain seperately. Except the altcoins that are physically backed by commodities, but at the point where society accepts them I doubt they will even be thought of as altcoins rather than the commodities and fiat they represent.

I only said it's antiquated because it's slow and wasn't able to scale in 2018 which cause a spike in transaction costs, maybe those problems will be solved in 2019 though. 
N there is alot of innovative cryptos like dent, wagger, powerledger, qlink, because of blockchains many uses there are many developers coming out with innovative projects.

Well currently it costs more to mine bitcoin than it's actually worth. Also the transaction speeds are bismal, and the transaction costs are on the high end. I love bitcoin, I think it was an amazing idea, but it seems like it's heading more towards a decentralized database, with almost no capable user front end. I mean I could be 100% wrong, but what do you see bitcoin being in the future? and to make any huge changes wouldn't there need to be a hard fork like bitcoin cash? or can the actual program be changed cause i thought as a blockchain bitcoin was immutable? as far as I understood it the lightning network was going to be long list of blockchains off of the original bitcoin blockchain to compute everything faster and then put it on bitcoin blockchain am I mistaken?

When bitcoin was scaled in early 2018 the transaction rates reached as high as 35 dollars before the market crash.
