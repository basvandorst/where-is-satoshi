You expect more from the CEO of Miocrosoft than just think like an average joe.
  
Also Apple stock raised even during the presentation so no, not everyone thought that the iphone was overpriced.

And now we are sure. So what do we do?

You cannot sell the stand anyway. No Apple consumer will purchase second hand equipment, it's against all their principles.

I wouldn't be so fast in accusing the OS of the phone when the security of the computer can be compromised as well. If the backup wasn't encrypted, and if your phone was connected to your computer, then your keys were visible from your OS. And if you remember, a few weeks ago we had a multi OS breach caused by the pdf component of firefox, which allowed a script to read all your homedir. Now did it allow the script to read your phone through USB? I didn't verify, but I know for sure that this hack was targeted at passwords stored in the homedir of the user, like filezilla for example. If I were this hacker I would have targeted the backups generated by bitcoin clients as well.

It's a magnet for fanboy money. You take the stand, approach it to a mac user, wave it in his general direction and with enough skill you will attract money. It's like fishing, it takes practice but in the end it works.
  
Did you ever saw those glasses of champagne without a foot? So you don't know how to put the glass on a table? That's the same with the screen. The novelty here is that it doesn't come with a standard VESA adapter! So you cannot screw a standard stand to hold the screen vertically on your desk. You can try, it won't fit. You can turn on the screen but you have to hold it at arms length and you get tired very fast.
  
This is where this stand comes in. For only $999, you can screw this piece of metal to the back of the screen so you don't have to carry it constantly at arms length. This ensures that you can work in the best condition, enjoy the best user experience and focus on what you are doing, instead of how your screen is standing.
  
This is genius business and the reason why Apple is leading the tech industry, they have constantly new ideas!

An FPGA is a development tools, usually coming in the form of a full featured board with of course the FPGA itself but also network connectors, USB, VGA, dip switches, LED display, etc. It's used as a development and experiment platform. When the development is over and you are ready for production, you send your schematics to a manufacturer who will produce ASICS, the end result of development. The ASIC is much cheaper and much faster since it's a refined and optimized products and doesn't come with all the dev features of an FPGA.
  
Today you would use an FPGA to develop a mining platform and once you are ready you would ask a manufacturer to produce 10.000 or 100.000 ASICS for your mining boards.
  
An FPGA is targeted at developers. An ASIC is targeted at consumers.

And this is why you should not rely or services like paypal either, who did the same thing to Assange. Whatever you think about the guy, it's the method that matters. Use bitcoin directly if you can.
