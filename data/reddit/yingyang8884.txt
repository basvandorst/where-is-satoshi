I think they are smart, they will try to dump hard, get all the Bitcoin cash from the weak hands and also get the nay sayers all the airtime in media ..we told u so , Bitcoin Cash is a shit coin/crap coin/fike bitcoin blah blah .. and then pump it to insane levels just to make a point, its here to stay forever. 
It will eventually come down but will still remain somewhere in top 10.

Se  you are not thinking of buying coffee tommorow, you are thinking of a world run completely on bitcoin and ecash. And when it does we expect more transparency that the previous systems. 
Is not just about ISIS, that is just an example. But then if you allow such systems, then what stops bankers to transact in private. What stops politicians to get favours in private. 
Then we are just facilitating all unwanted elements to make their task very very easy. Just rem the private key in your head and walk away.

The moot point is who differentiates between Coffee Purchases and Nuclear wepons purchases. 
Once LN is established. I can forever keep it open, and the values are never on Block chain. 
And then there is a concept of linking one LN to another , So essentially what you are doing is moving everything away from Blockchain and going towards centralisation and Fudging of records. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:37:13
Well even ISIS will want to run a microtransactions between them and bankers , and not have to let the whole world know about it for ever and ever. Amen ?

and now dropped at 2700
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:15:37
Then the question is then who wants to transact on chain ? I see no reason to transact on chain at all. 
Is it bitcoin anymore ?
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:36:26
Well I understand , no one can cheat on LN. But one can remain on LN forever and never post the money on Blockchain. If Alice and bob are on one LN and BOb and tom are on another and so forth.

Does Bitcoin have derivatives ?

There are lot of other exchanges supporting BCH, trust me its gonna stay for long. Like really long. 
Its coinbase loss .. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:23:43
DO you recommend to buy Bitcoins now (before Aug 1) or After aug 1 , wait for 10 - 15 days and then invest. 
Currently i am invested in other alts but nothing in bitcoin. I am planning to invest, just waiting for right time. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:52:39
Correct me but its not free in essence: 
SAy rightnow u hold 1 BTC worth 2000$. 
When it forks into 2, 
BTC drops to 1500 and BTH has 500 $ cost. So in essence you are neither gaining or losing. 
But the world is not fair. So Following happens 
1. BTC drops to 1500 , BTH at 200$. Essentially u are 300$ loss even when u have 2 coins now. 
Good time for someone to buy at that time. Lots of ppl are sitting on sidelines for a scenario like this to get into either BTC or BTH depending upon their preference. 
2. BTC at 1800 BTH 400. 
In this case you are up 200$. But still people sitting on sidelines have an opportunity to buy BTC at cheap. 
In future ofcourse the market decides the fate of both the coins.

If they have to that means they dont have money on Day 1. If you dont have money on Day1, you are not Dollar cost averaging. You are just investing when you have means.

Looks nice ... but what is the criteria for medium sized digital assets. IS there a min and max limits on market cap.

if it was not for POLO we would not be trading in ETC. Exchanges have a huge play here. the moment an alt is listed on an exchange, it prices jumps. 
So not true exchanges support has no reln with value
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:55:36
Well they cant sell it, coz then it will be then double spending. 
So what they will do with those coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:44:49
Well in terms of INR , its actually -ve price. i get BTC in GBP at almost market prices, where as in INR its actually trading at a premium of around 10 - 20 %. So even if we discount the huge transaction fees to convert BTC- INR, you still get more money than say GBP - INR provided by Western union. 
The only thing I dont know is there are differences in India about money u earned in India and outside India. 
Outside india money is tax free if deposited in designated bank accounts. 
I just dont know if the bitcoin exchange in India can deposit in these accounts or not. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:00:19
or the segwit dosent happen ... and the price goes tumbling down the gutter. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:41:42
well my question was more on technical side. 
I had heard to not buy almost immediately , because somehow that same transaction can be replayed on the other chain. 
So is that still possible on say Aug 1. or Aug 2 ? 
Not much of a techie here, but just picked up something which was discussed. 
Feel free to correct me if I am worng. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:18:11
i guess before the exchange decides to freeze transactions in BItcoins. So really depends on which exchange u have your coins and when that exchange decides to freeze out all transactions in BTC.

I have already thought over this on a personal level but there are lots of regulations in my country which makes this a no go. 
So I remit  money to India, which is the top destination in terms of total remittance. 
In India all Income earned in Foreign country is not taxable. Remittance from Foreign country has to come into a special kind of bank account which are seperate from banck account which are used for your income generated in india (eg: Rental income) . So essentially a Non Residence Indian has 2 acct. 
1. NRE - Where income from outside india is saved in INR ( essentially money you remit through Westorn Union) - No tax on this money. 
2. NRO - Where Income is within India is saver in INR (Eg : Rent from my house in india)
When I transact in Bitcoin. I currently have to buy it from USD - BTC say on Polo. Then move my BTC to a exchange in India which offers me in INR. 
But this exchange is in India and thus when I exchange BTC to INR back, the exchange can only refund me money in my NRO account and Not in NRE. 
And then I have to explain the source of these funds and pay taxes on money in India, which is already taxed in my host country. 
There is no way currently to avoid this double taxation. Otherwise BTC makes sense for Intn money transfer.

Are you willing to hold below ur purchase price ? just for Ideological reasons ? 
If not then clearly u are here for money. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:30:05
Well Greedy bankers in collusion with politicians created it , and tax payers stopped it. 
Not that Govt pawned off its assets.

Well isnt this too selfish.
What about thousands of people slaving, being under threat, forced to work under inhumane conditions, just so that you can buy a popsicle on walmart with USD. 
If it wasnt for Greed of oil in US, we could have got rid of a tyrant in Saudi too, If not for increased demand from US for cheap goods, there would have been less pollution and better human conditions in china. 
Would you still want BTC if it destroyed everything else you knew? Yes , not that current situation is all rosy everywhere.

The moment the news of SEC investing BITCOINS come , you will see prices falling like a pack of cards.
