I guess what Gavin is trying say is: talk is cheap, show me the code.

Don't need to got so far in time. Just look at the price in Dec. 15 2012.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:26:36
Hope this time they go ahead with it and announce it.
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:55:10
Also true. However, this shows that the demand for coins is high. Question the current price makes total sense.

He can so something like: send email to all users that will expire in &lt; 5 days. In the email a link to update the subscription. The api do the rest.

Bitpay and every company that do this kind of business might have to act like this in some cases. The good side is, if you really want to accept bitcoin, you can do yourself. Do the same thing with any other digital payment... Only Bitcoin can do it!

@_date: 2014-10-02 16:04:41
Next step is for the suppliers start accepting Bitcoin so the merchants does not need to convert immediately to fiat

Well, if you develop in only one language and use a IDE for it (like eclipse for Java or Visual Studio for C Yes. Vim will lack on many features. However, with many plugins you can diminish some (not all) those features. Also, Vim is a powerful editor! So you can code in PHP, PYTHON and C++ in the same powerful shortcuts in console, remote command line or in a GUI environment. It opens in seconds and consumes very low memory. You don't need to use the mouse or the arrows keys (which is very cool). You can even use Firefox like it was Vim (Vimperator). 
In summary: Vim FTW! :)
PS: the learning curve might not be so smooth, but once you get there, you just don't wanna go back.

To make it worse he might have used users funds to do no-no stuff

Amazon AND Walmart? How Bitcoin could handle that? 
From what I know Amazon alone could break Bitcoin in number of transactions, right? Unless Bitpay figure out a way to make off chain transactions.

 may be an option.

@_date: 2014-01-11 14:55:50


People are very bad in secure their wallets or doing backups properly. I'd say many have strong reasons to use "banks". Although they have the choise not to do so. In a way, all those web wallets, are like banks. They don't lend bitcoins... yet...
 
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:11:56
Thanks for generosity! &lt;3 BTC! _o/
@_date: 2014-01-15 01:09:26

In some cases, the cost might be a myth. But the "long time to transfer" part still applies.
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:34:35
Well, I'm sorry you understood that. I'm just annoyed that so many coins are invented just to get Bitcoins. I don't mind at all about other really different coins. Those that bring something useful and/or new. 
Besides I don't think those &lt;anyname&gt;coins are anywhere close to be competitors as they exist only to get Bitcoins... And that is why they sound like a scam. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:07:55
One way to give btc away and sell beer at the sametime, would be printing a public address on the label and the private key on the bottle cap.

Just think about the characteristics of bitcoin compare to fiat, and compare bitcoin to  those &lt;anyname&gt;coins.
If you still think it's the same comparison, I can't help you.

It's very funny to watch how those people have no clue how bitcoin works. They think is a fancy credit card.

Yes. Since ppl are used to cents, they want to to do the same. So, 1 satohi would be like 0.01 bit which is now the lowest bitcoin number.

I was also thinking about something like that.. PopcornTime is a great project, with Bitcoin working with it could hurt netflix in a future not so far away since PopcornTime is working great with chromecast...
However I was wondering: paying everytime you get a piece of data wouldn't create too many transactions? I mean it wouldn't flood the network? 
Imagine only 10 people downloading a 1080p movie and creating a transaction everytime it gets a part of if... 
Did a missunderstood the model?

Not dead just few activities 
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:41:13
I didn't know this, however there is still a problem. With only two parties this makes sense.. But with lots of parties at the same time downloading many pieces, how do you know how much is the Total to create the first transaction?
- Alice will pay Bob 1 mbtc over time. | Alice (1 mbtc) / Bob (0 mbtc)
- Bob send some part | Alice (0.99 mbtc) / Bob 0.01 mbtc)
- Bob other some part | Alice (0.98 mbtc) / Bob 0.02 mbtc)
What happens when Joe, Kate and 7 more people start to transact with Alice? Alice would need to have 10mbtc in advance? Even if the file I want only needed 5 mbtc to complete?
Hope is not so confusing my explanation... :)
Edit: And I forgot to mention the transaction fee
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:45:26
... and how long it take to clear after the deposit and withdraw?
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:33:03

I think it all depends. If gold is still at $1.2k, you might be wrong.
Bitcoin will be always compared to other assets. If it changes too much compared to those assets they will claim victory/bubble every time.

It's not a comparison it's like "Apples and oranges".
BU wants to make the blocksize free to be chosen without changing the protocol every time is needed.
Segwit will enable Lightning Network (off chain transactions) and will prevent the "Transaction Maleability" attack.
They can both coexist (IMO they will).
PS: The (theorical) blocksize increase by Segwit is a side effect, not its purpose.

After we reach 75%, 2 weeks later, a hard fork will happen.

If they use bitcoin and if the msgs between members were using cryptography, they might be ok right now.

Overall, there is one major point that makes BIP101 better than any other BIP (including this one): it's up and running! How are we going to test  ideas if they are only ideas? How to put them in the wild (at least testnet) to see how it behaves and discover its real flaws? 
For those  with some experience in software development know that "talk is cheap, show me the code" happens every single time. 
I'm sorry if I am being too rough, but the clock is ticking, and a working solution is better than any proposal to be implemented.

Control_Bot (CB) = 0 bits
Bob (B) enter the chat, 100 bits -&gt; CB_Bob = 100 bits, B_rank = 0
B speaks, B_rank = 60, CB_Bob = 40 bits
Alice (A) enter the chat, 100 bits -&gt; CB_Alice = 100 bits, A_rank = 0
A speaks, A_rank = 50, CB_Alice = 50 bits. B_rank = 10, CB_Bob = 90 bits
Charlie (C) enter the chat, 100 bits -&gt; CB_Charlie = 100 bits, C_rank = 0
C speaks, C_rank = 100, CB_Charlie = 0 bits (he loses his +v).
Now, you kinda lost me:
Your math:
CB_Bob = 16.60 bits + 90 bits = 106.6 bits
CB_Alice = 50 bits + 83 bits = 133 bits
CB_Charlie = 0 bits
CB = 300 (the amount enter by the 3 chatters) - (133 + 106.6) = 60.4 bits
* Did I got it right?
* Where did the 1.66 come from?
* Do Alice and Bob profit because they spoke first?

I see. 
By the way, there is no wrong... We are just trying to figure this out :-)
Another question: why people would want to speak in a chat like that? What would be the appeal? 
@_date: 2015-09-06 12:40:10
If you are so "super expert", why there's no flair (little books) on your user name?
@_date: 2015-04-20 13:26:56
I know this is not exactly what you ask but this is what I would do today:
- buy bitcoin in Canada
- Create one of those (mastercard/visa) cards that accept BTC
- When you want to spend local currency, just recharge your card and there you go.
Once you have BTC, you can spend using your card anywhere (visa/mastercard) is accepted. You can also withdraw cash in a local currency if needed (with a not so small fee, but it's an option)
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:37:43
Interesting. I would like to understand more the mechanics to see how difficult would be the implementation. 
Can you write some Alice, Bob, pratical example? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 12:05:33
People prefer doing what is more convenient instead of what is better for them. I can't say I can understand... 
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:52:02
If simplify Bitcoin is make it like traditional bank system, no thanks. 
Yes, people have to evolve and learn new things. My grandmother will never use the Internet because "it is too complicated". 
People are lazy and this will make adoption a little bit slower than everyone would like it to be. But that is how disrupt ideas work. 
Yes, we can make it little easier to use, but every time I hear that people are comparing with the traditional financial system. 
Let Bitcoin be. Give it time to show its importance, and the rest will follow.

Many ideas look pretty when they are just written or said. After you code and test it, then you can say that the idea is good or not!
