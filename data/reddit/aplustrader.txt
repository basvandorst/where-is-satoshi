Cash in the mail works best!

 - - - - Someone made a deposit into my account at BoA located at 1801 E Palm Canyon Dr Palm Springs CA at Teller  We were trading on LBC, which I am no longer excited to be a part of either by way, I verify the deposit online and via receiving a copy of the receipt, as I do with all these trades. I released the escrow and not long after my 3k deposit was gone from my account. 
Speaking with the branch manager so said the person who made the deposit asked for a refund since they made a mistake and in good conscience BoA returned it to them and took his receipt. The transaction does not even show up on your account history AT ALL. Without having the receipt I would not have even had a history of the transaction. After many days of stalling and faxing and waiting I was told I would not get my money back because the deposit did not post to my account, meaning I did not wait until the next business day for it to officially post. I said that makes no sense to me at all. I have had people make cash deposits into my account and then I can go the bank and make a withdrawal all in the same business day. 
If there is not a BoA employee involved in this I will be surprised to read it was just someone outside of BoA.
Sorry if I have skipped over things but I have been going through this for weeks now and I fuming angry.

We are currently working on our own trading platform. We merely sell off our investments through cash in mail. We are not a MSB. We merely buy our investments through cash in mail. We are not a MSB.
Cash can be overnighted and received as fast 18 hours from the trader's request. You can option for priority and it takes 2 days top to travel to most all locations from/to our mailing headquarters. 
I was unaware that trading via cash in mail was a degrade? Degrade from what? We have been trading this way for quite awhile now. Many traders prefer it over all other methods of trade for their own reasons.
Thank you

All set order number 1064. Do you send an email confirmation once it has shipped with tracking?
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:02:20
You rock, thank you. Ordering one now.

Thank you for the response. The link does not seem to be working though, No biggie : )

I am wondering about bill capacity, how many bills will it hold? 
Does it take more than one denomination of USD bills? 
What kind of programming do you have to do to the machine when it arrives, if any and ongoing? 
Are there any on-going fees once I purchase it or is it simply buy from you and no more money to you guys? 
Last question - How do I change my fee/markup, is it internal at the machine or external from a remote location?
Thank you for your time,

It is. I have been in touch with him as well.

Do we really think these guys paid over market for 30,000 btc? I read somewhere that they suspected the bid to be around 1,000 a coin?? whoa.... Why go to auction to pay waaaaaaaaay over market right now? All the bidders that have been beat that said what their bid amount was were way under market value. I suspect they were close to market value but a little under. I would estimate about 8% below market ( at the time of the auction) tops.

These are the same types of questions MtGox used to ask when they were around.
I wonder if Bitstamp is beginning to feel the heat from Government pressures in regards to their business transactions?

I did not see the scam last week. I will check it out though. My trades take place using my accounts so it would not be anonymous on my end per say. I have nothing to hide and I am not trying to scam people. I am fed up dealing with the "institutions" to trade my bitcoin. You would be sending your money trading via any platform to an anonymous person if you do not do your homework first. I used to trade under the user name ChristopherJenkins, account hacked and CarlWilson on LBC. Well over 500 trades on these sites without one scam.

Where did you read this?
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:46:50
I wonder who they used to sell them? Seems like a quick turn around to sell the coins off since the bust and seizure.
@_date: 2014-06-29 11:56:46
Email confirmation came through the day after I ordered :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:55:08
Got it. Thank you.
How about a warranty. Does the machine come with any kind of warranty?
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:39:48
Down votes? I am trying to reach out here and the community is just voting me down with out even reaching out first.
I understand the feeling, way to many scams to be had, I get it. It would be nice though to see the community voters communicate prior to bashing someone.
What can you do? I have just reached out that is all I can do.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:56:32
Thank you.
How about a warranty. Does the machine come with any kind of warranty?
EDIT - I found it under the check out tab - •90 Day Warranty on Components and Manufacturer Defects
Is there a way to make it so the machine would only be able to accept 20's and larger bills? To avoid a bunch of ones in the machine?

Was it via an email? I have had many email attempts to phish our account using LBC. That place is becoming over run with scam attempts and fraudsters. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:17:52
I just sent an email about my machine to info

The whole topic really disgusts me to even think about anymore. I know I was wrong for assuming I was protected by the big institution while conducting legal trades via their MSB. NO WHERE in the deposit disclosure does it state a cash deposit can be reversed without the account holders knowledge. NO WHERE does it state the account holder will be liable for BoA screw up. The scam took place with in BoA after the money had been placed in my account. BUT anyway I'm over talking about it anymore.
My words of wisdom..................... DO NOT TRUST BANKS ANYMORE WHEN TRADING BITCOIN........................ Whether they know you are trading them or not.
Thank you
I'm back to Cash in Mail and in person trades again. The slow and easy as the call it.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:17:34
I completely understand. However, to call me out as a possible scam without any evidence or even a correspondence is jumping the gun. I have been doing this for over a year now. I have NOT scammed a sole. I have been scammed myself in the past and even recently. I know the feeling and that is not what I do. I have many trusted traders and are looking to expand to more. I would love to talk more about cash in mail trades. 
What kind of things worry you about cash in mail trades?
I'm sure not knowing who you are sending your cash to is one of them. I have said it many many times before. Always do your homework. Communicate with your potential trader a bit. Get a feel for if they are legit or not. Ask the community. Make sure you do not get scammed, there are plenty of scams to avoid when trading bitcoin. I am not one of those scams.

Update - Jon was very helpful in resolving the issue I had with my skyhook machine out of the box. He was prompt in response time and sending out the replacement part to make everything right. If their customer service is an indication of how the company handles all phases of business they should be around for sometime.
Thank you again
