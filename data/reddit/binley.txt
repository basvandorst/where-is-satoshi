So you essentially just locked up $3,500 from your dad for a whole year...

This was a simple google search:
The Block Reward
When a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins; this value will halve every 210,000 blocks. See Controlled Currency Supply.
Additionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income.

They -couldn't- reward themselves with more than 12.5 (and get away with it)...
Technically, they could award themselves with more than 12.5, but it would get rejected as soon as they attempted any new transaction from their address by every other node on the block-chain since the block-chain disagrees about where their address randomly got more than 12.5 bitcoins.

Ah, the classic consensus of telling others to buy to reinforce your own decision of buying.

On the plus side, if bitcoin ever hits a million (it wont), then your 5 dollar investment will turn into 600+ dollars!

Even with the CURRENT circulating supply, for bitcoin to be worth 1 million it would require a market cap of 16684000*1000000 = 16,684,000,000,000.
16.68 TRILLION DOLLARS would be required to be invested into bitcoin. This could nearly pay off ~80% of the US national debt. Very unlikely in the near future.

To be fair most people aren't spending their bitcoin either.

RemindMe! of this in 2 years.

(100-11) / 10000 is the amount of btc you will get.
89 dollars is the amount of usd you will "get".

If coinbase was hacked or if coinbase stole btc from all of their customers then it would destroy bitcoin. It would be Mt Gox all over again and a ton of people would lose trust in btc.

You won't ever become filthy rich off a 50 dollar investment today, but it will likely triple or quadruple in the future.

That's my point... Nobody is spending gold, as gold is not really considered as a currency anymore. Bitcoin however is intended to be a currency, but it is starting to act like gold.

All you have to do is verify your account.

The amount of drama in the community is sad. It seems that every single post is about Roger Ver, which I really couldn't give a shit about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:55:11
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:10:00
It's a cool idea but you cannot deny that this 'video' is pure clickbait.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:08:52
It's lost forever.

If only that algorithm existed.

Do you understand limits? The rewards will never fully run out.

Considering bitcoin is an asset, you are actually losing net worth when the price drops. BTC is extremely liquid, so any BTC/USD value you have is *almost* as good as cash on hand. It is a gamblers fallacy to -ONLY- consider it as a loss if you sell.
