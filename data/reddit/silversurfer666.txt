Brown is a healthy color for your stool. I for one trust his advice.

Well he certainly hopes for it, his business would profit immensely if/when BTC booms again.

I think it's mostly the "rich" Africans who trade in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The poors don't have access to running water, nevermind a smartphone and 3G SIM card, nevermind a Trezor wallet. Hell, the literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa is 64% compared to the 90% global average. If they can't read, how are they going to trade Bitcoins? The answer is they aren't. This is just delusional.

Bullshit. There is indeed a minimum fee to buy Bitcoin. First you need a device that supports a Bitcoin wallet, then you need electricity, then you need internet access, then there's the BTC transfer fees.
To actually buy BTC, you can exchange it for cash if you're lucky enough that someone in your area will do it. If not, and you don't have a passport and bank account to sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange, then you may end up having to travel to other cities or countries to exchange cash for BTC. For an impoverished African this is not going to work.
Stop this delusional thinking.

Well you are clearly an impoverished African. No need for name calling.

Thanks for the tip u/brown_stool

Wow you are paranoid I didn't even downvote you. Don't forget to take your meds buddy.
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:19:36
... what?

Possibly but I don't think it plays a large role here. Not all of Africa is starving and for example in China during the communist revolutions tens of millions starved yet they have an average IQ of 100 (higher than European countries).
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:45:42
With an average IQ of 70, less than that in some places like Somalia and Ethiopia. Just FYI having an IQ of less than 70 in the West would classify you as mentally retarded. For the US military it's illegal to recruit anyone with an IQ below 84. So I think that's going to put a limit on the economic progress in Africa, especially as they become increasingly racist against whites.
