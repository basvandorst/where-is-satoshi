Interesting, I only somewhat understand QE. Is the "savings account" in this case kind of unlimited? Well, unlimited until some kind of final collapse?

But you must understand the risk -  like all currencies, it's possible to become worthless.

You have an awful retirement plan.
I have debt, make very little money, and no retirement at all and I know this. Buying $50 of gold every paycheck and putting it under your mattress is probably more what you're looking to do. 
If this your only retirement plan, I hope you succeed beyond your wildest dreams because I want bitcoin to succeed too, but dang that is a huge risk.

Soccer is the world's  sport, its always been around in an organized form for a long time. That doesn't mean this isn't a good idea.
This has always been interesting to me:
Imagine you come to an intersection.
There's a soccer match on one corner, a F1 race on another and a leg of the Tour de France on the 3rd corner (Yea...its a huge intersection).  
Anyway, with all this going 2 guys decide to fight on the 4th corner.  Everyone stops what they're doing on all the other corners and pays all their attention to the fight.
All human beings understand the fighting arts, even if such things are not in your nature.  A lot of people don't 'get' soccer.  Some guy ran near you so you roll around on the ground like you're birthing a child?
Perhaps boxing is bigger business than MMA in Europe right now. But combat sports have always been around, and the UFC is a damn juggernaught of a business.

I fail to see how eBay and especially PayPal are even necessary, at all, in a world where Bitcoin exists. I really hope they go the way of Blockbuster. I've been selling on eBay for a loooong time, since near the beginning. I HATE the double dip fees! HATE them!!! eBay owns PayPal and PayPal operates as a rogue bank that does whatever they want. I'd prefer to not deal with this system whatsoever.
eBay/PayPal need to be abandoned now that we live in a world with Bitcoin. There's a lot of bitcoin auction sites poping up, but that won't mean jack squat until wide adoption. is a great idea, but again not enough people. The multitudes need to get on board once they realize the utility, same way they did with netflix to kill blockbuster.  I'll be there the day it happens too.
I'm selling some late silver age/early bronze age comics and some 1970s prog rock vinyl for bitcoin if anyone's interested.

Lol, that's a good one.

Is this your site? Love the idea, the execution needs work. [You want help?](
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:58:08
Good point. Ultimately, Bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies, must meet worldwide adoption to a point where fiat currencies have lost influence. Ideally fiat will lose all influence and worldwide society will go through a paradigm shift but that's likely decades or more off in the future I guess.

That's funny because I live in Chicago and I just am tickled pink with the thought of no more Machine. Like, every idiot in City Hall gone? OMG, that's like a freaking dream I think most Chicagoans have had at some point. I'm sure the short-term would suck in ways I can't even predict but I'd absolutely remain in Chicago if all the government magically went away and Chicago became an anarchic city - mainly because I'm honestly not sure it would be worse than exists here now.
My brain doesn't understand how Chicago won't go the way of Detriot just due to our insanely stupid pension problem, not to mention other huge budget issues - those issues are so insane more taxes can't even solve it.  And things like garbage collection and filling potholes I think would be run a hell of a lot better.  I think its possible for public transportation and schools to be run a holy heck of a lot better...potentially.  I have no faith the people that inhabit this city would bring about a better way of life if the inhabitants of City Hall magically went away forever and for good, but I do think its theoretically possible.  I hope decentralized tech can be applied to local/city problems to at least partially replace a lot of utter worthless B.S. that occurs in city government.
Ok, well that was a long tangent post.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:22:39
I am still one of those that wants PayPal to die, and Bitcoin should be able to do that - but people are so baffling stupid it won't happen. People are conditioned to centralized things, they will gladly use btc on ebay through paypal...which is really stupid because anyone, like an auction seller &amp; buyer, can transact in btc w/o any ridiculous fees the ebay/paypal conglomerate will surely add. You can use escrow for free...paypal is obsolete when compared with bitcoin like all centralized banking &amp; quasi-banklike institutions. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:42:17
I understand the value of that, and it isn't a problem as I've already used escrow to buy stuff on @_date: 2014-04-03 17:25:08

Ah, thanks I hadn't thought of that. Perhaps we'll all just have to wait for quantum computing (if that becomes a real thing) to really change the game because cryptography will have to be remade anew at that point anyway.

This needs to be a slogan.  I have ~$3USD in BTC.  The reason for that is because I'm freakin damn near poor and I'm not going to risk any money that would mess up my life if I lost it.
But I love technology, and once I educated myself about the Bitcoin protocol and some fundamentals about economics, I can see how this changes things permanently.  Algorithms and (and real scarcity and deflation and its fungability) built in to the protocol have no emotion and are incapable of being stopped by centralized authorities.  
It might take decades, but my 0.00795908 BTC will very likely have a lot of buying power, $10K/BTC and to the moon is possible.  If not, I lost $3 but still educated myself a ton on stuff I didn't know before like the blockchain, investing and economics.
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:16:04
Lol, like it'll have any effect.  Either nothing will come of the investigation, or they'll get fined which will cause them no hardship whatsoever.   They're a centralized entity entrenched in American plutocracy, they know the game well.  J. P. knew the game very well.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:30:50
Awesome idea, Amazon should sell bitcoin.
But the way I understand it, it definitely would impact their bottom line.  Credit card fees eat a large chunk of their profit margins, every single time someone would buy something in Bitcoin, they'd make more money.

Ya'll can sponsor [me](
I'll do an entire album related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and put the bitcoin symbol as the album image. I'll name the album and each piece of music Bitcoin/crypto related terms - heck, the donors can choose the words to use! As the linear notes I'll have a short run-down of what Bitcoin is and how to get a wallet. I'll make a video for my YouTube channel, I'll post it on FB &amp; Twitter.
Now, before you throw all your BTC at me, I'm going to do all of this anyway (Well, if you really want to you can still throw all your BTC at me :). 
One of the reasons I haven't yet is because it takes time to do things properly and there is no money, at all in music. I play real instruments that require a lot of practice. Recording, production, and composing all the music is difficult and time-consuming. Being sponsored/funded through Bitcoin would make things so much better it wouldn't even be funny. I'd have incentive to work nightly and even potentially get some better gear. My wife would be ok with me not spending time with her because I'd have banked some 'coin. I could provide payment to other musicians I work with.
A project like this would grow my music brand and expose new people to Bitcoin. I am small time, but the exact people who find my music and like it are the exact type of people who would be into Bitcoin - tech-forward creative people that take a wide interest in the world.
So...that's my idea. If anyone would actually be into supporting this project let me know with a pm. Like I said I'll do it anyway, but if I actually have people interested in supporting this I'll have to figure out some kind of 'official' way of being sponsored.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:09:12
Well put. Damn well put, thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:30:09
I wish it were that simple.
Most people are never taught anything about finances, economics or credit all through their schooling, myself included. Then, for example, medical bills pile up, quickly and almost out of nowhere. Even WITH insurance. This can lead to getting credit cards, overdrawn bank accounts, utility bills being put off. Even if you live modestly and don't just spend blindly on stuff you don't need. 
Its very easy for this to happen to anyone before you know it. 
On top of that, at all times you have hyper-commercialised consumerist culture beating down your senses at every turn. Its just a cycle of bad finances that America runs on.

Well I did not understand it, I'm trying to honestly learn about economics because I was taught diddly squat about this in school. 
I do not understand what inherent value is and why the USD has it. If the IRS required people to pay in poop, it would give poop inherent value? Is that what you mean? If so, I guess I can understand that.
But then I have learned about the creation of the Fed and things like 'quantitative easing' and how the USD is backed by thin air...so I can't see any 'inherent value' in the USD. If I am wrong, I need help to understand why, I'm totally serious, I'm not a troll, I hate politics so I got no angle there, I was serious when I was said I was never taught *any*thing about money or economics in school, and Bitcoin being interesting &amp; exciting has spurred on some self-education for myself.
So please, at least expand on how &amp; why the USD has inherent value, because I don't get it. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:11:55
Very well put, excellent point.  I'm going to use the idea of Pro-Privacy simply making good sense for all business and personal use.  Its about comprehensive protection.
I'm a freakin nerd, I don't think I could be a criminal if I tried and I'm sick of people like my wife looking at me sideways everytime I try to explain the blockchain protocol or PGP or something. I inherently discuss decentralized tech in the context of centralized authorities and people start to think I wear a tinfoil hat.
While it may be true I personally want nothing to do with any government, I'm the farthest thing from a radical revolutionary.

@_date: 2014-05-06 19:41:14
Yea, I used to hold that opinion for a long time.  That's not the case at all.  Senselessly beating someone is not a sport. That's not part of any combat sport. MMA fighters and Boxers, for example, must compete against each other in the same weight class, pass physicals and blood tests in order just to be licensed. During the fight, the ref, doctors, commission members and/or either fighters corner can and does stop fights at any time.  Because its a sport, not about Blood! Death! and whatever. 
Then there is the years of discipline and technique training - stupid people don't get far in fightsport, especially professionally. Even if they have enough talent, without proper intelligence they wash out.   
Also, you really think team sports are filled with Rhodes scholars?

All joking aside, these are the growing pains that are necessary. We have trustless currency...why did we ever think having trust in an exchange is a good idea?
