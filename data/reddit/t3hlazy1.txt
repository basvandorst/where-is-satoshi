No, I apologize for the confusion. From what I know, we did not have a list given to us, but a list made from violations done in the library. However, it's possible some people ended up on the list from an outside agency asking us to, but I doubt it.

"So what is the correct and sane price for a bitcoin? No one knows, but the current market price is a decent indicator"
So, what is the correct and sane price for a tulip? No one know, but the current market price (50,000$) is a decent indicator.

I've worked at a library too, but it was in a small town and we did have lists of people who were banned. However, if someone who was on a "banned list" came in that we didn't know, s/he would have been able to use a computer since we didn't check any list. We just knew everybody who was banned.

I don't actually know, but I imagine they do more than just hoping the person doesn't get on the internet. They most likely have a blacklist for libraries/schools/phone companies, which fixes a lot of the issues. This wouldn't fix the friends/family or purchasing a cheap mobile phone though.

If you don’t think people should hold it, why do you care about it’s value?

Most people who are panic selling are worried it will completely crash and never come back. It could dip and come back up, but you can't guarantee it will. People who preach your message obviously have money (or something) invested in BitCoin, and are trying to prolong the inevitable fall of BitCoin.
