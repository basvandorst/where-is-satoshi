I think the problem isn't that you got stupid, but you got greedy.
I told myself I'd sell my Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash when they reached price parity.  1:1.  Doing so at any point prior to that would just be getting greedy, trying to trade Bitcoin at its peak for the new Bitcoin at it's genesis.

On that note, does Gemini support segwit?  I don't think it's generating segwit deposit addresses for me, and my withdrawals don't appear to be leaving segwit addresses either.

I think it's too much too fast.  There's going to be a correction.  I'm not sure where it's going to find support.  Could be 3000.  Could be 2800.  I'm mostly pulling numbers out of my ass.  But it feels like it a correction is coming.

I think it would have the same problems that bitcoin has.
"Not your key, not your bitcoin."  Only in this case it'll be "Not your key, not your vote."
People are going to be lazy and not want to fuss with managing their own private key to sign their vote.  So they'll entrust it to a 3rd party.  And we'll have all the same mess we have now.

Eeeeeesh.  29 days to go and BTC is in my range.  Now it's just gotta stay there!
Not likely.

I think the problem is he's just too old to really wrap his mind around bitcoin.  He wrote off bitcoin for the same reason he's written off fiat, considering it just a derivation of fiat (on a computer!), with the added risk of insane speculation.
Either he doesn't understand the value of an asset class the government can't confiscate, which is borderless.  Or he thinks it's only useful to criminals and that normies will never jump in except to speculate.
Which is directly at odds with his prediction that the next bubble bursting will be even more apocalyptic than the last.  At that point, normies will have more reason than ever to jump to a global, non government currency, that can't be confiscated at the border.
I have a little gold myself.  There are so many fucking laws about trying to cross international borders with it, it's basically a crapshoot whether you'll make it across with your wealth in tact.  The fact that bitcoin doesn't have this problem immediately makes it a better.
But, still, I don't think Peter is stupid.  He just has a pretty glaring blind spot.  Probably because he's wealthy enough that the concerns about government confiscation or trying to transport his wealth across borders doesn't occur to him.  He's effectively immune to it.

I just did this recently.  I put everything on a paper wallet before the fork.  After the fork I imported the private key into Electrum to get my BTC out, and Electron Cash to get my BCH out.
First I sent my BTC to my hardware wallet that I finally bought after the hardfork since they are back in stock at MSRP again.  Then I sent my BCH to Kraken to exchange to BTC.  It was a pain in the ass since Kraken kept fussing at me.  Took 20 confirmations on the BCH chain too, which basically meant I had to sleep on it. 
 Lots of cloudflare error pages too.  But eventually I just sold the entire lot of it for more BTC.  Then I sent that to my hardware wallet too.
The whole process was a lot more painless than I thought it would be, except for Kraken.  Just make sure you create a new wallet using the private key, have the wallet encrypted behind a password, and send it out immediately to it's final destination.  I read it's more secure to sweep the balance into a new wallet with a different seed.  But a sweep is another transaction with another transaction fee.  And since I was sending it on to a hardware wallet immediately, I wasn't too worried.  If I could have swept it directly into my hardware wallet I would have.  But it didn't look like a feature available to me.

I'm not 100% on the lingo, but when I mentioned a 51% attack, i was referring to the fact that a mining pool with 51% of the hashing power can validate anything they want and overwhelm consensus.  If the economic incentive to miners is low enough that competition in that space is scarce, it makes the network ripe for that sort of attack.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:59:50
They raised their fees too.  Combined with outages, that was just too much to take.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:42:27
The price is determined by the bid and ask prices at the various exchanges.  hodlers decrease supply, and increase demand, driving up the price.  But still, if there is **no** demand, the supply, no matter how scarce, becomes worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:54:12
Not sure exactly when.  I had a re-occuring weekly transaction set up to use ACH to buy $20 a week.  It went from charging me 50 cents to charging me $1.50.  That was way too much for me, so I switch to Gemini.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:28:32
This is the part of bitcoin I really don't understand.  What happens when the mining reward drops to zero?  What is a miner's motivation to continue participating in the verification of the network aside from transaction fees?  If they leave en mass for other more profitable crypto, does that make the bitcoin network vulnerable to a 51% attack?
I just don't understand how the bitcoin network still functions when the economic incentive for one of its participants is zeroed out.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:38
Same here.  I've been buying regularly since $1800.  Feels like so long ago, but I think it was only May or some shit.  And then bitcoin immediately nose dived to $1000 and I felt like an idiot.  Then it was up to $3000.  Then back down to like $1900.  It's just been an absolutely insane ride.  Now I'm so far ahead, I just keep dollar cost averaging into it, bit by bit.
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:18:25
It's tempting to try to take advantage of it.  But I'm sure I'm not the only one having that thought, and I bet coinbase isn't processing BTC transfers right now, breaking the arbitrage attempts.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:48:24
That's about how I felt last night.  I had a limit order set for 3500.  I get an email that it filled late last night.  So I check the price real quick, wondering if China is up to shenanigans again, and it's still ~4100.
Near as I can figure, someone dumped a shit ton of BTC on Gemini, clearing out about ~$600 price movement worth on the order book, which then instantly got arbitraged back to $4100 or so.
So lucky me.  Discount bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:44:17
Yeah, I sold mine during the pump.  I think I got about 0.18 BTC per BCH.  Made me happy.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:00:11
Well I am a newbie.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:27:49
As a newbie, this was my first lesson in "Not your keys, not your bitcoin".  I moved all my BTC to wallets I controlled before the split, and was able to sell BCH while the selling was good at around 0.18 BTC per 1.0 BCH.  I'd hate to have been locked out of the market waiting for Gemini or Coinbase or whoever to finally release my BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:03:55
Here is the thing though.  Without the credible threat of a split, progress wouldn't stumble along.  How long was Segwit kind of going nowhere?  It took a split for things to come to a head and the stakeholders in the community to pick a side and force it along.
Yeah, in hindsight, the minority chains of the split which weren't supported by core all failed.  But, they also consistently brought contentions to a head and pushed things along.
I'm all for people continuing to split if they don't think their proposals are being given their due.  Better to bring the conflict to a head than let it fester forever.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:11:18
Alright, possibly stupid question.  What is the advantage to running my own node?  Controlling my own private keys makes total sense to me.  But my own node?
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:56:11
But imagine how much slower it would be if people **had** to agree?  Instead of one group going their own way, and another group going theirs?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:51:57
I swept the private key into Electrum.  Although in retrospect I could have saved myself a fee just importing it.  From Electrum I sent it to my hardware wallet.  Once my BTC balance was safe in my hardware wallet, I imported the same private key into Electron Cash and sent the BCH balance to Kraken.  I sold it for BTC, and then sent that from Kraken to my hardware wallet.
I did this maybe a month after the split?  And the balance on the paper wallet had increased since the split, so my BTC balance was slightly higher than my BCH balance.  Which made the amount I was sending on the BTC chain an invalid transaction on the BCH chain, so I wasn't worried about replay attacks.  At least I'm pretty sure that's how things work.  Like I keep saying, I'm a newbie.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:40:11
Well, it's one of those things where it's hard to discover, but easy to spread, and it can be made "simple" for the layman through tools put together by more competent hackers.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:18:03
I got one a bit ago.  Although at the time of the BCH split I had everything on a paper wallet.  Presplit, the prices of hardware wallets were just too crazy.  I was **not** going to pay over MSRP for one.
Post split I sent my BTC paper balance to my new hardware wallet, and the BCH balance to Kraken to swap for BTC.  Worked out fantastic.

@_date: 2017-07-30 13:46:46
Yeah, I moved from Coinbase to Gemini exactly because of crap like this.  So far I haven't been given reason to complain.  I can't set up a reoccurring automated transaction to autopilot accumulate BTC.  But the fees a way lower and it hasn't gone down at all.
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:26:52
I don't think it's just the scaling issues.  It's also the lack of a top down authoritative process which scares off the "smart money".  I'm not sure if the "smart money" will ever come around to trusting the weird clusterfuck of conflicting interest that need to come to a consensus to move Bitcoin forward.  What a lot of crypto advocates see at BTCs greatest strength, they may always see as it's greatest weakness.
I don't think the smart money will dive into BTC and drive it up to 5 digits until their faith in top down authority is broken.

I did just this last month and it was a ton of fun.  Got a raspberry pi 3 board to run it.  Learned a lot about raspberry pi, linux, mining, pools, etc.  Totally appealed to the tinkerer in me to tweak the voltage on those things and slowly get the speed and stability up.
I might make a whopping $10 a year off one miner.  Can't really say if I'm breaking even on power consumption or not.  I'm probably not.  But it was a fun way to tinker.
I also got an LCD kit I need to learn how to solder which I'll attach to the raspberry pi board, and it will display the hashrate and other stats directly on the LCD so I don't have to remote in anymore.  That'll be fun whenever I get around to it.

My understanding of the paper gold market VS the physical gold market is that they share a spot price.  However, the paper gold market is constantly flooded with contracts for gold on demand.  Nobody ever demands this gold, because they don't want the overhead of shipping, insuring or securing it.  They're just waiting for the price to shift so they can pass the contract onto the next person.  There have been rumors of issuers of paper gold contracts suddenly scrambling to actually source the gold they've promised when someone actually does call the contract.  But it's hard to tell how much of this is being blown out of proportion by gold bugs.
However, it's not totally insane to think the banks are controlling the price of gold.  I believe almost every major European bank was nailed to the wall for engaging in price fixing of silver a few years ago.
I wouldn't be shocked if we see hedge funds try to fix the price of bitcoin similar to they've done with precious metals.  But I don't think it will work, simply because there is no centralized spot price of bitcoin.  Also, it's effortless to transfer and store bitcoin.  The arbitrage will simply be too great for them to control.  If they flood the market with contracts of bitcoin on demand, people will demand it and sell it on other exchanges.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:47:37
Sounds like the OP wasn't keeping them there, but moved them there to sell, and then ended up empty handed.
Which does raise an interest point.  How can you safely convert crypto to fiat without the counterparty risk of an exchange?  Are you left finding an individual buyer to take them off your hands at whatever exchange rate you can agree on between the two of you?

I'm assuming Segwit goes off without a hitch.  Of course, there is the 2x hardfork after that :/  But I'm hoping investors are euphoric about getting through one potential fork that they are temporarily blind to the next one.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:17:45
Couldn't you just generate the public/private key and jot them down instead of printing?  You'd need to make damned sure you wrote it down correctly, but if you are that worried about the printer being compromised, I imagine you'd be careful writing it down.

Man.  I'm so glad I got out of Coinbase after their etherium flash crash.  Next thing I knew after that they'd cranked their fees way up.  I had no faith they'd be able to responsibly handle whatever happens Aug 1st.  Looks like I was correct to judge them so harshly then.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:05:10
Yeah the timing of this was really confusing.  I thought the 2x hard fork part of Segwit2x was still a few months off.  Made me wonder if I'd completely missed some massive timeline update.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:40:55
I think having a reserve is pivotal too.  Always have some money laying around to bolster you margin call price if things go south fast.  Then buy the entire way back up.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:48:15
Because as soon as you sell at 2600, it'll skyrocket to 3100.
Alternately, as soon as you buy at 2400, it'll plummet to 1900.
If the market were that predictable, everyone would do it.  Instead it's a giant game of "I know you that you know that I know..." repeating forever with millions of participants.
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:19:21
To the best of my research, Gemini doesn't fit my use case.  It doesn't do automated weekly purchases, nor will it automatically deposit the BTC into a wallet I control the private key for.

Yeah, I keep hearing mixed things about India's bizarre demonetization experiment.  From "It's absolutely tanked the economy and wiped out the life's savings of the entire peasant class" to "It's been an unparalleled success and totally wiped out corruption and nepotism".
But still, having India go from demonetization to "legalizing" bitcoin (whatever the means) is enough to make my head spin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:55:03
I imagine some of what was punishing you is that you were getting double penalized.  A lot of places have the transaction fees for credit cards built into their prices because they are the most common form of payment.  A few of the smaller mom &amp; pop shops around me essentially subtract transaction fees if you pay in cash.  But for the most part, whether you pay with CC or not, you are paying the fees for one.
You very well may have come out ahead had you been allowed to subtract credit card transaction feeds, and added back the potentially much lower bitcoin fees.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:47:12
Yeah.  I started putting $10 a week into bitcoin at 1800.  So far my weekly deposit hasn't actually occurred at a peek of 2800 or 3000.  Just keeps missing it.  Dollar cost averaging FTW.
What I have been doing is some margin trading, buying the dips and selling $100 or $200 upstream.  Squeezing a little extra profit out of the volatility.  No need to try to go all in and all out on major swings, although the little green monster in me keeps trying talk me into it.
I got savaged pretty hard once or twice when the price kept plummeting beyond what I expected and I almost hit my margin call.  But it wasn't hard to triage a little more cash in there which I'll pull back out (with a nice profit) once I close my margin.  Taking a few small profits here and there along the ride I've gotten the margin call down to around $1300.  So I feel pretty safe... for now.

The first thing I see on their front page is




I'm not sure this is an improvement over coinbase...
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:32:00
Too little too late for me.  I wasn't on the ETH market, but this hosed things up so badly on GDAX across all the other markets.  My heart goes out to anybody who had a stop loss at $200, and had their accounts liquidated for 10 cents because the slippage was so horrible.  And it happened so fast, and people were so thoroughly locked out of GDAX, there was nothing anyone could do to get out of the way of it all.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:38:25
That would be nice.  I leveraged up my margin at 2200, 2300, 2400 and have been deleveraging at 2500, 2600, etc.  If it hits 3100 I'll go ahead and close out my margin and wait for another dip before leveraging again.
It's a bit hard to believe though.  I'm kind of new to this, but looking at the order books, unless a ton of fresh money comes in buying, or the sellers retreat their orders higher, it's gonna be a long slow road higher than 2800 by the end of the month.  It's not like these things can't happen.  But it seems unlikely with all the FUD around forks.
Edit: As if to make a liar out of me, BTC is at 2750, and making a hard run for 2800 **today**.  Shows what I know!
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:10:24
Just set a weekly reoccurring transaction.  Dollar cost averaging is fantastic.  I do $10 a week.  I may increase it to $20 after all this nonsense around potential forks clears up.
It really depends on whether you have faith in the fundamental value of blockchain currency.  It always hurts when an investment you just bought goes down.  A few months ago I bought NTDOY at $25 and it immediately dropped to $24.  Now it's almost $45.  If you have faith in the fundamentals of your decision, you'll have to weather a few ups and downs before market forces eventually deliver on the rewards.
Bitcoin has enjoyed an incredible run.  The marketplace for it just keeps expanding, and there is only so much of it.  But institutional investors haven't even gotten started yet.  When you start seeing central banks and mutual funds adding bitcoin to their balance sheets the same way they add gold, bonds or other equities, the price could easily move another order of magnitude or more.  
At least that's the theory.  It's a theory I subscribe to, but it's still only a theory.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:02:38
I suppose that answers my question then.  Stuck with coinbase for my use case.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:23:16
I swear I saw just that today.  During the freefall to 2500 on coinbase, I saw what was likely a closed out margin or a stop sell of 25 coins get dumped.  The chain reaction off that was quite impressive.
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:48:27
Yeah, with all the volatility in the bitcoin market, I feel like monthly isn't frequently enough to dollar cost average.  But I haven't done the math on what I'd save due to fees.  Maybe monthly is good enough.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:38:34
Looking at the prices of other Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is practically a safe haven right now.  Which is odd to me, because Bitcoin seems to have the most uncertainty due to potential forks in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:26:41
I use Coinbase.  1.5% on ACH payments, which isn't terrible.  It's just 15 cents on a 10 dollar payment.  I know GDAX is cheaper, but the least you can buy is 0.01 bitcoin, which runs around $25-30 the last few weeks.
Still, with all the problems Coinbase and GDAX have been having lately, I need to find a place that's a bit more reliable.  I'm new to BTC so I just went with what was easy... for now.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:00:07
How when you send it from GDAX for "free", are they paying the TX fees, or is it going out without a miner tip?  With the huge transaction backlog right now, I'd be worried about getting my BTC out of gdax by August 1st if the transaction wasn't tipping the miners.
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:03:09
You aren't wrong.
Which is why lately I buy BTC on leverage against my existing BTC whenever the price drops, and deleverage when it rises.  Earn a little extra profit on these swings!
Of course, I'm operating on the assumption that if I wait long enough, bitcoin will rise overall.  I could theoretically get crushed if this ever fails.  But then again, I'm not leveraging a ton either.  If BTC goes low enough to hit my margin call, I've got bigger problems.
