Great.  
Have they said anything about the debit cards coming back?
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:29:19
It was down for a few minutes. It seems to be back up again.

In 1 payment channel it doesn't. What's stopping someone from opening 10 payment channels with 10 different people. The transactions aren't broadcasted to the blockchain for some time.

This all seems so unreliable. How can payment channels stop double spending?
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:00:52


How exactly does it work?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:03:20
Edit your post then, please.

Nice read. So basically the effective money supply is lower than the actual supply. For USD, most of it (new money supply) is exported to China. That's why it's not felt as much.

How can I run a lightning node too? Is there a guide I can follow?
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:57:12
It is not a massive problem.

You're naive if you really believe that.

So a prediction market? Cool!

There is absolutely no need. I used to think there was, but it's like saying at some point we need to increase the size of CPUs to get more out of them.

Who should lock the price and at what price? lol
Just think about what you said for a minute and you'll hopefully figure it out.

The answer to your question is kind of complex, and nobody explains it better than Andreas Antonopoulos. If you have time, his talk about this is really worth the watch: 
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:28:49
That's right. Consensys.net is the company.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:51:15
Not a waste IMO. He did a fantastic job explaining everything. I'm sure a lot of people on both sides learned a lot.

If you are _really_ interested in this subject, watch this talk by Andreas Antonopoulos from a few days ago:

The co-founders of Bittrex have decades of combined experience in security at Microsoft and Amazon.
Singular guys did an interview with them:

Why the hate?

Akasha project is a fucking joke.

No they didn't, just the hashes.
