Why does Blockchain keep public addresses (from paper wallets)on your website whereas you did not before? There was time you could enter your public key  and get the amount balance on your paper wallet with out the public key remaining on your website. If you can extract private key from your public key, I do not understand why you would not think this is a security risk. Thank-you for your time.

I am a hodler and you have to read about the global events that are happening right this moment. There is an enormous  movement (even among the IMF etc) to  change banking transactions etc. Yes, I can see that there is some discord here on the forum regarding which step to take next. This is part of human nature to want control of everything but if you all could get together here and look into the future you may all become very powerful (globally) and wealthy. I am not in the computer science realm but I do understand how to work together for a common goal. As far as security the threat will never go away. I remember living in Palo Alto in 1996 and seeing Marc Andressen' computer code (Netscape?) and saying "OH  I am not going to buy anything on the internet" for fear of losing all of my privacy. Look at where we are today. Everything points to going forward. The reason I am a long term holder is I am looking for a certain ROI and then cashing in and buying some more Bitcoin. This is all a mind game. If everyone could gather their energy together this could become a reality very fast.

Learn to love it for what is it (FUD). I check prices once a day and I am trying to get that to once a week then once a month.Work in progress.

I am truly sad about this whole thing. I did not realize how you can never be truly independent of the system.

Thank-you very much for this post. As an outsider I had to think why it took me so long to understand why I seemed to be one of a few women who even heard of Bitcoin. For example this week I had ask a dentist and a MD if they knew of Bitcoin for their practice and both did not know anything about it. Both are educated and one of them said "I like cold hard cash." Why is there not a great app for this? One that works seamlessly.Why was it that Steve Jobs had develop the I-pod and it took off so fast. Well I have my own opinion. It was easy and had a clean design which was fun.Very simple for the average Joe. I think Bitcoin is great and I do see that people will continue to use it but I do not see mainstream adapting that fast. This was not intended to be an insult. Anyway I will still use this.

Not sure if I am understanding this. If they buy from Coinbase or any other exchange I am assuming they have a computer or they bought Bitcoin (from an exchange) from a computer at a public library. Why couldn't they transfer the Bitcoin to a flash drive or print (keys from a printer at a library). Hopefully they have some type of knowledge of turning off WiFi (printer). So far everyone I have meet that has Bitcoin is very technologically advanced Appreciate your response.

I have Bitcoin and so does my 17 year old. I have a bit more than them. I think that is a whole lot of money to put anywhere. Remember what FUD stands for. Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. You should spend some time reading alot about Bitcoin and understanding even say the "blockchain". It was not easy for me to get started on this. Some many places to go to ie Blockchain .info to find out what was on my private addresses, how to get a paper wallet for storage because of the risk involved. Remember there is always risk,"online". How to deal with the .00007099 minus .00000005437  to give the miners some gratitude for their work. Always came up with the wrong  Also, many tabs (on my computer) to work with when finding the conversion rate between Bitcoin and dollars.It was really confusing for me. If I wear a computer  programmer I have so many ideas to make the process much easier. Anyway Good Luck and yes I do like Bitcoin.

You can buy on Coinbase, or go to a meetup and form relationships with people over time. It has to be trusted relationship.There are Bitcoin ATM machines all over. You will have a fee associated with buying Bitcoins.

So cute!

I have a different perspective. I use the internet for everything but I think in order for the mainstream(people) to accept Bitcoin you have to start at a very simplistic level. I would start locally(communities) and even start with ex (cafes, eateries). Begin there because everyone likes to eat. Community building is very important. Word of mouth {very important and underrated} and other businesses would join the bandwagon.

Ok thanks.

Why can't I spend only a bit of bitcoin on my paper wallet. Why can't I leave some on there for another time. Is it because of a safety feature? Private key  Only can be use once on blockchain?

I think this is a good idea.BAT. What do you think?
