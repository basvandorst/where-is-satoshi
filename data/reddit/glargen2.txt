This is, I think, the most fundamental criticism of both Anarcho-Capitalism and "Small government"-Conservatives. You can take this thought even deeper by applying the idea of taxation as redistributive by nature.


It's a matter of rhetoric. People come up with all sorts of weird euphemisms for their political/economic ideologies.

I will as soon as I get home. Right now, my lack of food and cigarettes has me way too aggravated to try.

As you are in mine. Credit where credit is due, while I still think the initial argument is ultimately invalid, it was a beautiful set up to make me look like an ass. Hat tip to you. 


It's all good. The only thing I'm pissed about is my unread box blowing up with people reading only the first two or three posts of ours. 


Fair enough. As I said before, I'm much more interested in the econ portion of it than the nitty-gritty technological aspect. But I suppose for bitcoin specifically, it is so tied into the technological aspect it needs understanding to go after it comprehensively. 


I tell people the same stuff about Marxist theory. ;) If you don't understand the first 3 chapters of Capital, you shouldn't even bother talking about it. (Which I suppose is a bit of hypocrisy on my part in light of this discussion)

Why is gold trading at 1668 USD?

I'm not a computer guy, I'm an econ guy. Everything I know about bitcoin is based off of the economics of it and what I've heard from it's users. (And the stream of news stories regarding the several high volume thefts they've had.) So sure, maybe I'm a douche bag for bringing up safety concerns while not having a doctorate in bitcoin bullshitting, but hey, it's a conversation.

Okay :)
@_date: 2013-02-07 23:17:34
That's me! :D
Yep, because my inability to steal something I'm not familiar with proves bitcoins are totally unstealable!
Wait....

Well, I do see where you're coming from but I disagree with your characterization of Marxism and Capitalism. Ultimately, at their core, both theories come out of the idea of individual workmanship and the notion what you produce ultimately belongs to you. (Note - I say Marxism rather than Communism) 
And sure, I'll take you up on your offer. I'll wait till I get home to set up the wallet and what not. If you'd like I can do a paypal transfer or something like that to pay you for it :)
