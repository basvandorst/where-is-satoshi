@_date: 2017-06-25 16:59:08
That's funny, because I was only responding in kind.
So, I'm supposed to allow others to speak to me that way, and accept it?
Fuck You for suggesting that.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:25:04
That does not hinge on what others think of me. 
If your beliefs change depending on that, it is concerning.

That all changes with LN and atomic swapping. Fees will be in tandem with the vision outlined by Charlie. Confirmations are 3/4 faster as we speak, and it is not "only faster because it has less users" despite what you've implied.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:20:30
This entire thesis of litecoin fragility is not relative to assessing the technology itself. 
Use facts instead of cherry picking irrelevant shit to support your supposed argument. You have no argument besides trying to be "right". 
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:20:02
Im doing extremely well, actually, and i have an amazing team on my side.
See, the difference between my team and yours is that this side doesnt judge situations based on how they appear, but rather what they actually are. Wake up and stop attacking people you dont know or understand.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:05:53
Your messages are almost equally as mind numbing and trivial. I'm getting there, I just replied. 
I'm not in a rush to be on the defense some more... I take my time with this shit. I have a real job, this is me killing time.

This response was to be expected; irrelevant because you were wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:46:43
If we're talking about compromising based on the scale of the network, then highlighting litecoins disadvantage in relation to its size is rather shortsighted. That is not an issue with the technology itself but rather its adoption rate.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:32:04
Actually it's because it was designed as an optimized version of bitcoin.

Untrue - this actually reinforces my conviction, because I don't allow opinions such as yours to bear unwarranted influence.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:14:19
I said read more, as in do your own research.
I cannot hold either of your hands for this one. You will both need to stand tall on your own in the crypto-world, and venture beyond Reddit for information. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:16:03
That would be easier if I didn't have people like you immediately attack me without even understanding my point of view.
The fact you expect me to accept people speaking to me condescendingly speaks volumes about your character. People like you are exactly whats wrong with this world, afraid to confront evil and hopping on the bandwagon to berate people you dont understand.
Everyone on this thread immediately became brash  because i didnt link up and type out my entire thesis on litecoin. I find it absolutely pathetic that i am considered condescending for asking people to do their own research. Act like a goddamn adult and do your own research, stop being sensitive, and stop being a follower.

*"Kitcoin overcomes this deficiency"*
Haha. Decentralization is most certainly an **efficiency**.
During the goldrush there will be pyrite.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:44:47
It's still decentralized, and will coexist with bitcoin. Bitcoin is gold and litecoin is silver. LN and atomic swapping will change the game and no one on this entire sub-thread seems privy to that.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:19:45
Your uninformed comment is the only thing that's embarrassing here.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:21:19
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:46:36
Well your dense then, because I believe in more than one coin. 
The  mere fact that you and everyone else immediately get on the offensive about such a trivial issue and then defend everything dismissively with the imverysmart subreddit shows where your head is at.
I never said litecoin will be the only cryptocurrency. Anyone who has attacked my posts so far did so out of an inferiority complex, as they rely on Reddit stature and upvotes for confidence. 
I see being a Reddit strongman is important to many of you, and that in itself is incredibly revealing.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:29:45
Do you even know what the "argument" is? 
That's what most of you are missing. You're so hellbent on proving yourself that you're dogpiling on nothing. Arguing for the sake of "being right" is so meaningful to you that all logic goes out the window.
No one here even knows what the hell they're even "arguing" for here. I'm a crypto enthusiast overall and I don't think litecoin is going to take over the goddamn world. I do think it has a purpose amongst coins. For whatever reason, probably a napoleon complex, all of you love shitting on people when you see someone else actively doing it. Herd mentality at its finest.
Sheep. And no I'm not showering under your guidance, wtf? Awkward
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:09:46
My only point was that litecoin has a purpose. 
I'm a bitcoin enthusiast. 
What L?
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:14:18
Do you understand the gravity of credibility in the world of investment? If someone has even a .01% chance of a flash crash wiping out their savings, or a margin call, then the investment prospects are slim to none.
What makes you think this actually lends appeal? Your argument is rather whimsical imo. If you want cryptocurrency to remain merely a microcosm of the financial world, an underworld in the shadow of the stock market, then what you're saying stands.
I contrarily believe in cryptocurrencies and overall blockchain technology going big, and that won't happen if the general population does not feel safe putting their hard earned money there. Period.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:02:30
Idgaf what subreddit I'm on, if facts are relevant then I'll post them. This information is not irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:04:49
Good thing I have no concern whatsoever for how people take me.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:59:09
No, it won't. Read more, and check 
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:01:46
Ok cool when you and your friends have your 15 million lined up to put on the line and attack let me know. 
In the meantime Charlie lee isn't in hiding and the community is gaining traction, so the litecoin blockchain structure is not set in stone. In fact it's being upgraded as we speak. Do you keep up on those things?
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:52:58
sturmeh, focus. They were your own words. You were wrong with your assertion of me "spreading misinformation".
Damn, your attention span cant even span more than three messages? You were also dead wrong about my alleged lack of care for what i represent. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:43:08
All jokes aside, I have a serious question for you.
Why did you pretend to know what you were talking about when you had no clue what you were saying? Or were you just lying through your teeth for the sake of "being right"?
And if you "didnt copy and paste", and that information was memorized, why are you memorizing information you don't even understand?
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:18:35
Actually you cherry picked information that suited your argument despite the fact that it's not even relevant. 
It's hilarious you even brought that shit up in the first place, acting like you knew what you're talking about and calling 15mil "chump change". 
I'd say you fell from grace but you've been a clown from the start
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:43:36
This is a good move on coinbase's part because it will help retain credibility on behalf of the crypto community. Many new crypto investors got burned and it could have negatively impacted the public perception and adoption of cryptocurrencies. 
This accountability goes a long way since many mainstream investors are highly skeptical of putting big money in crypto to begin with. If we want this to become integrated into other facets of our lives then this is definitely a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:22:45
What they're saying is it's less prone to attack because of its size, which is an extremely shortsighted method of assessment considering scale is subject to change e.g. Bitcoin and ethereums rapid ascension this year. My point wasn't that litecoin is better than bitcoin, even though there are plenty of dumbfucks here that started attacking me assuming those are my views.
The narcissistic dogpiling around here needs to stop. I know some of you have self confidence issues but talking shit online isn't an accomplishment, and any confidence gained is transient. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:32:26

@_date: 2017-06-25 15:11:26
Actually I have a life outside of Reddit, and my internet stature is not paramount, which clearly being "right" online means a lot to you.
I'll wait for the facts to roll out, and in 6 months I'll roast you. Now scram.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:00:04
I don't think you understand the dynamic here.
Thanks for replying, though. A+ for effort.
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:18:15
I was responding in kind, and since you simply judged the entire interaction ive had thus far on tone rather than actual content, you misjudged and assumed i was in the wrong.
Look in the mirror.

RemindMe! 6 months

Yup. I don't do the back and forth with ingrates.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:54:54
You must've failed English. 
Quotations have a meaning, were you unaware? Let me break it down (one time):
"right", meaning not actually correct, but subjectively believing they are "right". This was regarding the topic of online arguments, exactly what you are exhibiting by following me around on here and angrily replying to my every post.
Thanks for proving my point and showcasing your severe lack of intelligence at the same time. I suggest exercising your critical thinking skills and getting back to me. You're looking foolish right now, and that's not a good look.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:32:17
Buy Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:09:48
Once again, showing the ignorance of this subreddit.
I never said litecoin was superior. Does anyone here fucking read?
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:27:22
Incorrect. Read more.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:08:21
What you fail to recognize is that while you care about being "right", I don't give a fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:22:27
How can I argue with this logic? So well thought out, and brilliantly articulated.
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:55:08
Your argument is fundamentally flawed as it's based on the size of the network and not the technology itself. The fact that you would even use that kind of information to support your claim really shows your ability to comprehend what you're reading.
Also, like other dimwits on this subthread, you jumped to the conclusion that I was bashing bitcoin and got emotional, which explains why you copy and pasted irrelevant shit you don't even understand.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:08:23
Please give an example as to where I've been wrong, since you don't even know my fucking views to begin with. That was the whole point of the post you just replied to, and you are so goddamn dumb you reply and do the same damn thing again.
Check yourself.
