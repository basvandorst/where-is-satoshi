That's the way you see the world?  Ok, can't really say anything to that. Thanks for your contribution.

Ahah, the more you know... :)

CBA actually cancelled my student account a number of years ago.  They gave me a a short time to get my money out before they were going to close it.  It was a zero transaction fee account so no points for guessing why...  The sooner BTC becomes standard and runs these crooks out of business the better...

Thanks for your replies 50 bits @_date: 2014-12-03 06:31:04
Am I interpreting [these]( [wrong](  They seem to indicate you can?  Not on a useful scale yet though.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:17:20
No, there's just so much optimism here,  nothing is perfect and there's often at least a comment in popular threads suggesting bitcoin is a gamble and might go to nothing.  I'd like to know how that would happen.

The failure state I was thinking of was it having an irreversible state and being valued at or near zero.
Gold doesn't really qualify due to it having a multitude of other uses. The block chain wouldn't qualify for the same reason. Just the coins themselves.

Without anyone spending them they'd quickly become worthless though wouldn't they?  Don't get me wrong, I think bitcoin is awesome.  I'm just not sure what to think about the trust aspect.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:19:12
lol, maybe I should have qualified with 'feasible'.
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:37:47
Because there's currently no recourse if someone sends bitcoins and gets nothing back, if they want to use bitcoin they'd like to be 100% certain that the person they're going to send the coin to is giving them what they're paying for.  This is made especially problematic if the vendor's on the other side of the world.   It means an average person is going to be less trusting of a vendor than they are in a system where they can issue a chargeback for a fraudulent transaction.
From other comments here it would seem this is only a problem for bitcoins in their relative infancy and won't be the case forever.
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:39:34
Thanks for the advice.

I'm new-ish to the bitcoin area with an old account.  Currently clicking faucets all day every day to try to make a start.  Not really sure what to do with it once I have it though. I understand it's currency and I think it's only going to rise in use but at the same time it's not going to go far if most people stockpile their bitcoin anticipating future wealth.
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:28:41
This is my biggest concern about bitcoin's future.  Trust is not measurable or calculable and it's not like anyone can do much about theft or fraud at the moment.
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:36:09
So from the 2020 phrasing you think dogecoin will take over? =P
@_date: 2014-11-15 11:59:22
Wow, ok, they seemed the most appealing on the surface, no GST and accepting of Australia.  Thanks.

What kinds of technologies are coming into play?

I had it for just under 10 years after uni but then one day out of the blue they sent me a letter with something along the lines of they no longer found my account to be of benefit to the bank.  I forget the exact wording.  If you got to keep yours maybe it was just me =/  I was in the habit of emptying it every pay day but still...
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:56:23
I don't know why someone downvoted you for answering my question. Rude internet people! :)
I think both those problems are overcome by increased adoption.  Greater utility means less incentive to convert because vendors can use bitcoin to pay their own bills.  That coupled with limited supply means increasing value and reduces the number of people/groups who have the wealth to successfully manipulate pricing.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:57:20
Thankyou kind person.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:21:25
Ah ok, cold fusion guys must have moved into another field. Cheers.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:11:51
Thank you good person.  Is that a tip or a statement?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:37:53
Just as a thought experiment, and completely off OPs topic but does faster than light time travel require velocity?  
To summarise my understanding, the theory is that time slows as you approach the speed of light. So relative to everything else, the object moving close to the speed of light is experiencing less time.
Quantum entanglement is separate from that relativity?  Simultaneous action at two points without any faster than light time slowing movement between them?
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:36:56
Wow, well put. I hadn't even started to consider the potitical implications or global benefit.  Makes me feel a bit ashamed for thinking from a personal wealth perspective. Much food for thought there. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:12:12
Why do you feel that way?
Edit: Here's a tip to make amends for the downvote 10 bits @_date: 2014-12-03 03:42:36
You could make more than that on faucets.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:18:30
Ye, I think the copyright wars are showing the same thing.
@_date: 2014-11-15 06:04:05
What was wrong with igot if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:15:17
I'm only new to the bitcoin love but my biggest hurdle has been obtaining bitcoin.  Due to the instantaneous and irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions they don't gel well with the reversible nature of other methods of payment and therefore extreme measures have been put in place to be able to track down anyone who attempts to take advantage.  This is creating obstacles for eveyone who wants to get involved on a serious level.  Though I don't yet see a way to avoid this it poses a serious impediment to fiat money users migrating to bitcoin just because the time worn methods of credit and debit aren't easily interchangeable with bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:35:02
Wouldn't that require a global consensus?
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:26:28
Ok, thanks.  So it's the relative infancy of bitcoin that makes for any trust issues.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:26:24
The first computers were built over 70 years ago. Networking was first being used around 50 years ago.  It wasn't for decades that the technologies advanced enough that the average person had a use for them.
100% of people have the problems with currency that bitcoin solves.  Bitcoin hasn't matured enough and the technologies built for it to be both widely known and accepted.
Edit: People have built their lives around the way the world currently works.  They've had no choice.  Just like before the internet people built their lives around the way things were then.
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:38:17
Ah, good to know. :)

    *Money is better spent than saved because it's purchasing power decreases over time.
    *People make less rational financial decisions because they need to spend or invest as quickly as they can before their currency devalues.
    *Money saved is an investment in itself because purchasing power increases over time.
    *More thought is taken before spending and fewer impulse bargain buys are thought rational.
    *People become more considering and by extension less rushed and more at peace with their inner decision making.
    *A renaissance of financial enlightenment begins.
    *World peace is acheived.
The last three are meant to be facetious of course though imo btc does change the world.
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:40:15
None of those seem likely.

Ye, I don't know why I bothered to post here.  It's full of early adopters and people who bought so high they've currently lost money. I was only trying to share my own positive outlook on bitcoin.  I could respond to each of your points but that's a game I've played before in different subs under various accounts and I already know the outcome.  Thank you however for actually taking the time to reject my points and not just ignore.
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:59:51
I get the impression from his tone that reasoning won't change his views.  Your article would give insight to anyone unfamiliar with the concepts who might take him at face value.  Nicely written.
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:53:17
You sir, are a dick and have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm sorry that you lost money but that's no reason to take it out on me.  I'm right and you know it and I hit a nerve and for that I cop your abuse.  Moron.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:50:06
So banks lobbying the governments of the world to change their laws?  Seems like it'd require an unparalelled level of global cooperation and agreement between rival banks, ruling bodies and the general populations.
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:37:48
A few points in no particular order
* If you "don't know shit about bitcoins" how do you know this is "en ***essential***" concern
* If you've been looking at this sub from time to time you know this is a place for predominantly positive news (and witch hunts which it shares with the rest of reddit).  You'd also know that there are other subs like and to give different perspectives which balance out on the whole.
* If you read the contents of the links, maybe coupled with a little research about anything you didn't understand rather than focus entirely on the emotive last sentence, you'd realise he did answer the concern.
Those points lead me to believe you are concern trolling as suggested.
