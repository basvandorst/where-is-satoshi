What developments? All I've heard is an increase in the hashrate supporting BU.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:32:17
Not even close.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:09:38
I agree. There are times for artificial limits.
To fight spam we had a 250kb blocksize limit then 1MB. And it served its purpose.
But we've now seen the inbalance flip 180 and the devs in-charge have procrastinated. So much so that we now have a contentious fork.
I ask in all sincerity, what is your 1 biggest fear of a free market blocksize? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:46:54
There's an economic imbalance introduces by the 1MB blocksize limit. (This limit preceeds Core but they are accountable for not increasing it.)
BU accounts for all you have mentioned by way of Moore's law, economic theory and game theory.
If physical resources are pushed and cannot accommodate then fee's will rise. But fee's then adjust as resources compensate.
We are seeing this occurring right now but there is an artificial limiter which is the 1MB blockchain.
We are witnessing the ecosystem forcing an adjusting.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:34:36
Not at all. And I understand this is the concern of core.
An economic balance will develop. Blocksize will adjust to keep fee's an economic maximal that best maximizes the resources of the network. In short, the fee's will remain small and reasonable for all transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:56:19
I don't assume altruistic behavior. I think the network assumes bad actors.
Centralized devs? So they both do not a use a master repo? This seems like a ridiculous argument.
Core looks to keep decisions close to themselves; example the blocksize.
BU looks to push decisions to everyone on the network, nodes and miners alike; example the blocksize.
Core now seems to say it is the economic majority and not the miners that have control. Does BU give the blocksize choice to miners? According to Core's view it does not since nodes can specify an accepted blocksize limit for a node. So on what rational basis is the fear concerning BU and miners?
We'll have an answer soon enough as to who controls bitcoin. Was Satoshi correct or Core? We'll see.
Either way I do think bitcoin will come out of it stronger and fire tested yet again.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:05:59
BU proponents want the network to work as an organic system, as designed.
Core proponents want controls placed on the network, for the reason I think is they fear the system will not self-adjust organically.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:37:17
It's a pretty accurate summary.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:09:47
BU: nodes and miners together decide blocksize
Core: only Core decides blocksize
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:25:09
No.. I don't think he's supporting core.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:22:33
Are you capable of having a restful discussion?


Wouldn't that also apply to BU? User also decide by running nodes.
I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree, or at least I do. I'm done with your insults.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:40:35
I'm speaking of the the blocksize method of determination with BU. So I'm not sure of your point.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:47:25
Segwit has been stalled for some time. Seeing that it will not be activated a lot of ecosystem has looked for an alternative solution and found it in BU.
IMHO, BU has also become a scapegoat for the segwit crowd.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:36:04
I don't know Mike nor did I ever speak to him so I don't know his motive.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:23:26
Thanks for the link but I think Gavin and Mike make far better points.
The entire argument that bigger blocks help large miners because of propagation delay is a non-starter. If a delay would help big miners couldn't they do that now with 1MB blocks and simply delay relaying a found block and begin work on the next?
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:58:52
Coinbase is pretty large ~~market~~ wallet maker. Yet they are playing the fork natural.
I thought core proponents said the wallet makers and such were the economic players who would make the decision.
Maybe, just maybe it is the hash rate and corresponding nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:55:57
And here I thought bitcoin was decentralized.
Oh wait.. it is. 
Make your move.
If you don't get your self-imposed 95% then stop complaining.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:53:40
BU will fork when it has 75%+ hashrate. Be patient.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:47:18
Good talk. Take care.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:02:02
I'm suggesting the system Satoshi designed has considered these factors. People will attempt to game the system and the system will adjust and remove the incentive.
We've seen it before when a pool has been seen as  too large; the community spoke up. The community is part of that ecosystem striving for balance. Coding artificial limits is not.
Why all the fear in letting Satoshi's design work? 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:34:34
LOL true. But actually low-carb.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:39:22
Separate account for btc. Take it easy on the conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:10:21
So you lose the argument and stomp away.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:20:17
Callousness. A 4-yo knows to end a joke after 7 times. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:02:52
I'll ignore the insults for now.
So all devs contributing to Core have the ability to merge code back into master? 


Sorry, I didn't realize core devs were not human.
Do you understand that BU gives control of the blocksize to miners -and- nodes? Miners and nodes work towards a consensus as to what the maximum blocksize should be.
