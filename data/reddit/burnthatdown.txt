Nope.  Problem was with Overstock's customer service on the holiday being shitty. Overstock did indeed have the bitcoin - the transaction failed because it timed it out but didn't refund it immediately.  I edited the OP to reflect what happened.  Honestly, it seemed like a relatively straightforward transaction that should have gone better than it did, but it appears from talking to Overstock CS that it's best to make sure you can get on the phone with their customer service if there's a delay in processing the payment because they cancel it and don't have a well-oiled process to refund bitcoin.

no, because I've never used my wallet except to watch the value rise and fall for two years.  Never spent a bitcoin, but I followed the instructions. 
Hence, yes, I'm a complete rube with it.  Need help.

Yeah, no shit. All I've been doing with it is sitting on it. This was an experiment.

I did.  Blockexplorer told me that it went exactly where I sent it. It took a phone call to straighten it out, though, which had to wait until they re-opened from the holiday.

It did. See my edit in OP about why I'll never do this again.

I would say it's a bad idea to try.

Coinpayments claims it doesn't have it.

It was confirmed by their processor but not Overstock.  Overstock did indeed have the BC.  I edited OP to reflect what happened once I was able to get through to Overstock.

I can see this, but neither the processor nor the recipient claims to have it to request a refund.
