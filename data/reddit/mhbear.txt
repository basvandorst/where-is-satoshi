You should do it if you've got savings to cover 3 months set aside. Other than money for 3 months, I'm all in. I'm sure this will get downvoted but also considered putting ~5% in other currencies like LTC. They will be riskier but there seem to be more opportunities for major growth this year. BTC is safer than LTC but in the end its a gamble no matter where you put your money. Best of luck!

It sounds like you've had a ton of firsthand experience over the years. I'm relatively new to cryptos and was more spouting off my naive understanding so thanks for the clarification! One thing I've noticed in the community is the frequency of repeated questions and a lack of definitive answers so your explanation was very helpful.
Even if the arguments for LTC are more aesthetic and overstated, LTC doesn't seem to offer anything less than BTC so maybe there can still be value there.

I think this means that it's highly unlikely LTC will have the same 51% threat BTC is experiencing with GHash. My understanding is that the lack of SCRYPT specific hardware will prevent individuals from attaining disproportionate amounts of hashing power.
The ability to mine via SCRYPT also means basically anyone with a PC can start mining, whereas a person who wanted to start mining BTC would have to heavily invest in hardware.
BTC will always be king but if LTC were to gain more traction as an acceptable form of payment, there's no reason to think it won't also be perceived as valuable.
