That's right. I am having to use a South Carolina address for deposits (under new email account). Have not made any cash withdrawals yet, and not sure how I am going to yet.  I have made a few withdrawals to purchase a few Gold Eagle coins, and hardware wallets, etc., really enough so far since I am mostly hodling.  I guess HI passed some really onerous institutional "on-hand" deposits rules, like exist for banks.
