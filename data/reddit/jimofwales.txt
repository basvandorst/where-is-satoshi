Yeah I guess ‘investment’ was the key word there. I guess it’s just hard not too see a home as an investment, considered how much of your income it sucks up. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:50:14
I bought a miner for 26btc
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:49:21
Except maybe a house. That can be quite good. Or bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:43:36
Not all of them no. But I’ve done alright from the whole bitcoin thing, put it that way. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 07:56:35
His Ma's little black book.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:18:00
Nah, no way they'll lose 50% in 25 years. It's about 0.5%/yr. 
I've seen panels 15yrs old still working at their factory rating. Solar PV is basically a rock that produces electricity. 
The inverters not so much, but they're a small part of the overall system.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:00:04
Paper wallets and electrum mainly. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:20:38
I miss Intersango. Bought my coins on there for £8 with BACS transfer. Those were the days. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:03:10
I bought a PC for 30btc. Which is now about the same value as my student loan. But 2100, wow!
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:38:18
Intersango, the very first Bitcoin exchange had this. As far as I know. It's the only one. I use to buy my bitcoins there at £3 a pop. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 07:57:39


So basically...never.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:16:13
Holy shit. :(
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:04:55
Intersango were selling at £8/btc. And accepted regular BACS transfers. That's where I got mine....and still holding!!
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:23:50
Still the best exchange the UK has ever had. Worked so smoothly. I was going to dump my entire ISA (£3,400) into them at £8. Gave myself a good talking to and backed out. Still done pretty well though. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:42:45
Wish I could find that post from the dude who woke up in the middle of the night to find the price crashing and cried his eyes out.
edit: here it is - 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:20:51
Got my coins out of Gox a long time ago and they've been sitting in cold storage ever since. Probably going to ignore all btc related news for a few months and hope it all blows over. I'll join you in the Winchester. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:52:02
Even my nan knows what Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:32:07
I never really trusted them. When I bought my first 100btc I was bricking it. I took everything I could out as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2012-01-24 17:03:55
I don't think you could be more incoherent if you tried.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:34:19
How much would that t-shirt have cost you?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:31:18


(you’re right tho)
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:14:04
Fair enough. Thought you might be one of those ‘life-savings’ idiots. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 01:33:06
I bought a couple of hundred at 2GBP and slow them at 17....not bad!
@_date: 2011-12-16 18:32:34


I stopped reading here. What utter fucking bullshit.
@_date: 2011-11-20 17:01:49
'WHEN bitcoins are the de facto standard of the world'. 
Are you serious, I can't tell?
@_date: 2011-10-21 18:12:58
Oh dear oh dear. 
@_date: 2011-09-11 11:13:21
What did they say? Did you not worry you sounded like a crazy person?
@_date: 2011-09-09 21:54:17
@_date: 2011-11-26 22:45:40
my miner is gathering dust.
@_date: 2011-10-19 14:35:04
How much is a significant amount? I made a load of money buying at $1 and selling at $23, also did a fair bit of profitable mining. And I would NEVER buy into bitcoins at this stage. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 13:59:17
I can't imagine what is going through his mind. Would you cash out a percentage, hold on for a potentially huge future pay off? How would you secure your wallet effectively. Fun times. 
@_date: 2011-10-09 12:16:02
Huge brand? Really? You need to step away from the Internet. 
@_date: 2011-08-17 12:31:03
I had something like this with my wallet backed up on it. When my computer got stolen I was really happy I'd backed it up on a USB stick. Then i found out the USB stick was plugged into the back of my TV, which was also stolen. FFFFUUUUUU
@_date: 2011-09-26 13:20:15
My mining rig is turning a tiny profit, but it's kept my living room about 2 degrees warmer on average (I'm in the UK). This is the only reason I keep mining tbh.
@_date: 2011-11-10 00:22:19
I occasionally come back to for a laugh. Cheers.
@_date: 2011-10-22 11:19:24
Electricity is equivalent to $0.22 in my part of the UK. My miner is gathering dust and I'm thinking I should sell it, or start using it for gaming.
@_date: 2011-08-17 14:36:31
I didn't think of backing it up online. :( Too late now. 
@_date: 2011-09-13 21:22:07
Seriously though, did you really?
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:03:22
Nice. Might list a few things I've been meaning to sell later. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:28:28
Canada is the only one I'd consider. America and Auz though, fuck that. I'd be dead or bankrupt if I lived in the states. Your healthcare system is a disgrace.  
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:15:23
I enjoyed it. As someone who's been involved in Bitcoin from the early days (and lives in the UK) - it's depressing. The price is global though and although I'd like to spend them here more frequently, I'm going to hold long-term. 
If worst comes to worst I'll fly to the states and sell them to fund a big trip around the continent. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:58:48
Hahaha, as a Brit that's hilarious. 
I'll give you 800 nonces! 
*NO THANK YOU*
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:57:58
I'll chuck one in for you.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:46:26
That long valley of $100 bitcoins. They were screaming BUY ME. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:30:28
That's about quarter of a million dollars, holy shit. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:38:36
Looks like an intermediate payment system for AirBnB?!
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:47:01
I agree with everything you've said. Out of interest, what's your opinion of the future of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:12:04
It will almost certainly drop below what you paid at some point. Just don't panic. If you're in it for the long term it might be better for your sanity to stop following the news. That's what I did (only pop in here every couple of weeks). 
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:36:42
I do short term room rentals in Cardiff, Wales. Would be happy to take payment via btc! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:54:56
UK here. Once you take all taxes into account (income, council tax, VAT, petrol duty, alcohol duty) we pay about 50%. 
At least we have the NHS I suppose. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:40:43
I'm not sure which I understand less - women or the cryptographic principles underlying Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:27:31
You should at least try MDMA once, man. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:49:03
Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish long-term. Been holding since 2010 myself. But I believe there will be a few large corrections along the way. Nobody can predict the future, so it's impossible to say definitively one way or another. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:51:22
The US isn't the whole world. Anyway, I think any major action against bitcoin would be the ultimate Streisand effect. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:12:19
I feel like my bitcoins are pretty safe with electrum. A strong password and the 12 word seed have been written down and stored in a couple of places. Can't see how anyone could conceivably steal them. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:54:09
He bought one with 10,000. Mmmm million dollar pizza. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 10:40:39
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:38:01
Stencil art was around way before Banksy. Although he did popularise it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:17:11
Whilst I still believe there will be a large crash. The tulip analogy is getting a bit tired. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:13:54
Oh dear. :(
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:24:36
We still haven't got a proper exchange in the UK. FUCK. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:15:10
If there is a big correction in the next few weeks. Don't fucking panic sell. 
I bought a load during the last bubble, then the price crashed. I held my nerve, it took months. I basically stopped looking at anything btc related. But now we're back in the game.
So it's too early to decide whether you've been smart or stupid, it's how you react to what comes next.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:46:35
You misspelled 'utter shitrag'. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:27:50
I bought a GPU miner for 29btc. Today i would've also paid off my student loan.
I'm not too bothered though. It was bought with pure profit and I have never sold any since that day. 
We needed people spending in the old days to get it where it is today. 
Onwards and upwards. 
Forza Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:53:56
Not sure giving (what is essentially) cash, along with a university paper is a good idea. Maybe offer to exchange some in exchange for a charity donation. Or set him a wallet up. You could get into trouble or place him in the awkward position of having to say no. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:04:56
Hell, with contactless credit cards you don't even have to take your card out of your wallet to pay! Wave it at the machine, wait 2 seconds for it to beep. Walk away. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:34:19
Everyone has their price. ;)
Nah, I'm sure he's an honest fellow.
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:04:49
How much did you lose? If you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:47:26
That low?
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:22:14
I've got lots of btc, but I'd trade it all for a little more. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:36:56
Bitcoin is a like a drug. But what was even more like a drug, were the drugs. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:17:28
Oh dear oh dear.

How did you transfer the GBP to Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:02:55
Yikes. Makes me think twice about selling in the UK. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:16:31
Thanks for that article. It's amazing. I remember flipping out when I saw the first SMS message being sent in the early 90's. I would rant to anyone who would listen about how this was going to change the world forever. I couldn't understand how so many people couldn't see it in the same way I did. Especially my parents and the older generation. 
It's always been obvious to me there is an adoption curve with new technology. But I'd never thought about how critiques of new tech are handled in such a similar way throughout the ages. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:21:48
A true redditor!!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:51:56
The UK desperately needs an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:44:24
they were high on mdma? :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:57:12
I would love a bit of boring in the Bitcoin world right now. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:13:32
I used this strategy back when they were $8. I wish I'd been a bit more brave (hindsight I know!).

Something about three wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:09:11
Ah right. Because all the listings in my city are identical to AirBnb (there aren't many). 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:48:41
I can't find the source but I read it somewhere official. It obviously depends what income group you're in and how you spend money. I keep a pretty tight budget and it seems to be around 50%. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:44:34
Can't believe they tax lottery winnings in the states! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:26:46
The killsats had a pre-set kill limit.
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:29:25
Damn your cheap electricity. I pay $0.26/kWh in the UK. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 10:40:10
If you use 8kWh to power a computer, you will get 8kWh's out as heat. Exactly the same as a bar heater. Where else is the energy going? It doesn't disappear into the ether. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 21:03:32
Correct if I'm wrong, but doesn't the blockchain clearly show the original bitcoins mined by Satoshi? I wonder what the implication would be if they starting being traded/moved?
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:24:19
I used to pay 8,700,000 turkish lira for an ice-cream (before they knocked off a couple of zeros) so it's not outside the realms of possibility. 
I hate the word satoshis though, I don't know why.
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:03:13
Braver man than me. Good luck! 
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:55:38
Interesting way of looking at it. I was mining for a while at 700 but electricity in the UK is expensive and it wasn't worth it. If I'd have kept going I'd have a stack more now at £60GDP each. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:42:45
When talking about electrical heating, people tend to use the word 'inefficient' when really they're trying to say 'expensive'. It's about 4-5 times more expensive to heat with electricity than nat gas. But 100% efficient.
