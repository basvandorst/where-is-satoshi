This reminds me of the old debate about Gresham’s Law and bitcoin. If I have $100 USD and the same amount in BTC, but the BTC might be worth $150 tomorrow, what is my incentive to spend it? Thus people hang tightly onto their BTC and spend their fiat, slowing down adoption.

I really don’t get it. This after yesterday’s “rat poison squared” comments. What’s their endgame here? I mean, these are smart guys. Munger had always been famous for outside-the-box thinking...

Lol anybody else remember this guy from “Party Down”? Great show, ended too soon.

Nice teaser. You should serialize the story and publish it here weekly!

Congratulations! Looking forward to reading it. Are there many folks researching this subject in Edinburgh?

I’m not saying that WB is lazy in general (he obviously isn’t). But it’s disappointing that he and Munger use their positions of influence to mischaracterize and denounce btc. But others should feel free to continue worshipping at their shrine.

Plus (especially in the US) you don’t want to trigger a potentially taxable event by selling. Write down all of the info (private keys etc) and put it someplace safe. Then forget about it for at least a year.

What "Asians"? It's 2am in HK and Beijing, and 3am in Korea. (But I totally agree not to panic.)

Right but the same is true of all currencies, right (e.g. if everybody sold their USD for EUR)? But again for USDT to collapse, one would need (1) everybody who owns it to sell, and (2) the exchanges to be unable to cover the sales, right? Is there any other way for USDT to fail?

Ok, yes thanks. I guess I’m just trying to understand all the FUD resulting from the Texas study. Lots of unfriendly media outlets are seizing on it as evidence for “manipulation”, but would they likewise consider the Fed a “money printing scam”?
