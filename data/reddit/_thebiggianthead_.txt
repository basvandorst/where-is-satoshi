I wholly agree with the stupid leniency of the sentence but the use of such idiotic narrative just show how ignorant and uneducated you are. 
That is in the UK. Such non sense talk doesn't make any sense. Judges are not affiliated to a political party and are not appointed by politicians. Even if the name of the judge is published, no one knows anything about him/her.

@_date: 2017-12-29 19:39:43
They are not an honest and straightforward company. You should read the comments left by their customers (in reply to this TW) that are locked out for weeks and months despite doing crypto to crypto
They didn't even announce that on their TW acc as usual I found out by accident.
What ever notice you get with $2k per day withdrawal limit. You need over a week to withdraw one Bitcoin.


@_date: 2017-12-29 20:53:17


This is an ignorant statement to make. No one is trading anonymously or illegally, they have full names and everything.
As it happens if you look further than you nose and ignorance you'll find that there are countries out there that have IDs (not everyone living out there has a passport with English as translation on it) and so on written in local languages that exchanges do not accept.
That make the verification practically impossible and many had their coins stolen by exchanges like cryptsy in the past despite never using FIAT.


Another dumb shit to say. Them being trading or not doesn't affect your silly trading DUH. May be you should sod off to coinbase then. 


May be you should educate yourself on why BTC-e was shut because the reasons you have given are bull crap.

Not wrong and I never said anything about respecting or disrespecting their clerics, that's your own words.

So you rely on other people's upvote/downvote of comments to make up your own mind!
This make you read comments and make up your own decision instead of relying on vote numbers.
If you wish to see the top/highest upvoted comments just sort comments by best.
I think its a good think that is being used in default subs to stop brigading.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:59:33


That we should keep in this subs. It doesn't affect the usual experience as comments can be sorted the way one wishes (best, new....).

I assume its going to be the same process as the last two auctions. 
The winner of the last 2 auctions didn't dump the coins on the market so that didn't affect the price but now with BTC prices being so low, we will have a lot more bidders with not necessarily the same ethics and responsible behaviour.
Not sure why they moved the sell forward. It cant be panic selling, it costed them nothing.

You missed the important bit. They rejected that block hence no fork and no new coin. Unless they have just forked the last hour, there is still only one chain and no BCC.

Kraken will halt XBT funding at 11 am UTC and safely secure funds during the fork. Funding will be re-enabled after the outcome of the fork is clear and the network is safe.

It doesn't matter if you moved them before or after the split, the fork had no bearing or distraction on the Bitcoin chain.
You can check on the blockchain if the transaction did go through or not and where your coins are.
If they left your wallet contact Kraken tech support.

It is a sad day if you think that the "biggest business in Bitcoin" is a reflexion of what the Bitcoin experiment suppose to be and aim to achieve. 
The mere fact that business owners are now trying to dictate the future direction of Bitcoin is an anomaly in itself and you have obviously misunderstood the concept and goals behind the Bitcoin experiment.

I'll be happy to sell it to them for 10BTC with a FREE upgrade to segregated witness when released as part of the service :P)

I can confirm, this works "r/bitcoin" and this doesn't work "yum yum :)

Never mind the science, this guy is chubbier. An obvious scammer.

He doesn't even need that. As one of the holders of the network private key he could have sent an alert message to all wallets with a short message. SORTED

How much does the pic of the woman helps with the sell since it is irrelevant to your items?

If she deleted her bank app from her mobile the money will still be in her bank acc. That might be the thinking behind deleting the app, having said that........
Mobile phones are very private and personal and everyone (including you) is very specific or weary of what you download on them. If you don't trust or like the app it is deleted. You should have used your own mobile to demonstrate....

Since I got goxed and finished off by mintpal I have about 0.02Btc and will probably never be able to get a full bitcoin before the awaited take off, unless I get adopted by the Winklevoss brothers obviously.

GOOD, let the US carry on with their hostile legislations towards cryptos. Asia and Europe are moving forward and embracing the technology.

I agree with having issues with trolls in this subs but your definition is extremely vague and open to personal interpretation. You need to be more specific what you think is trolling and provide examples. (dogecoin wiki provided in a comment below is a good example).
Further more, banning someone just because a comment or a post might be seen as trolling by a MOD is just heavy handed. You can initially just remove the offending comment/post and notify OP. If OP doesn't take notice and does it again, he/she deserves the ban.

Is it possible to track down his main wallet from the one used to deposit to MtGox?
@_date: 2015-10-01 20:38:34
I am no dev guy but I find it hard to understand that a worldwide network such as Bitcoin processes transactions every 10mn!
Wouldn't be easier to speed up the blockchain instead of this never ending block size argument. Lets say a block every 5mn or so.
The blockchain can easily handle that no sweat.

Why ask for ID to verify after he deposited all that money?? I mean seriously. Why didn't you ask for that before?
Some people trading in alt coins live in the most remote isolated parts of the world and might not have the IDs in English you are asking for.
One wonders how many of those poor souls did Cryptsy steal their money and kicked them out of the crypto world by this practise. 
Don't wait for people to deposit money and lock them out after that asking for IDs.
Stinks of dishonesty to high heaven
This is a sign and practises of a shady unscrupulous business that should be avoided like a plague.
Edit: Can cryptsy publish how many acc were affected by such practice and how much coins did they steal from users?

Bitcoin is borderless if a country decide to regulate it users will vote with their own feet as it happened in NYC.

His statement is correct and yes we are aware that there are other sites on the internet which is beside the point he made.
