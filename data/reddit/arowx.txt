I though most people worked out their income based on some time based metric hourly, daily, monthly, per annum?
Even bonuses and royalties have temporal elements, bonuses tend to be annual and you have to be still employed.  Royalties are based on a percent of profit or sales over time.

But the oil only has value because it saves people time, on the flip side using oil has negative time impacts on the health of people, the environment and climate change.

It's like money is just a measure of time, yet we focus on money, energy, production everything but time itself.

So won't the growing size of the blockchain mean it ends up not as a PvP network but a monopoly?

You do grasp that exponential growth, tends to collapse systems e.g. the rice and chessboard example.
* 2018 200 GB
* 2019 400 GB
* 2020 800 GB
* 2021 1.6 TB
* 2022 3.2 TB
* 2023 6.4 TB
* 2024 12.8 TB - 16TB is about the largest HD available
* 2025 25.6 TB 
* 2026 102.4 TB 
* 2027 205.8 TB
* 2028 409.6 TB
* 2029 819.2 TB
* 2030 1.6 PB
So you hit massive storage, bandwidth and processing problems that would collapse any chance of a working currency!

If it's not gambling what is the payment rate for mining?

Maybe your missing the point?
Say you have solar panels and batteries and use the energy to heat your home and sell the excess to the grid.
In this scenario you are using a dumb heater,  the difference when you add mining is the energy goes to a 'smart' heater the CPU or GPU doing the mining.
It's taking the Smart Grid that everyone is talking about down to the heating elements used in your home.

Time and money.  Energy kwh, purchase and wear and tear to hardware.  
You could even consider the CO2 footprint of their power usage and it's impact on climate change.

It is only gambling if your mining does not guarantee a pay-out for your investment.
Think about it wouldn't you prefer to mine bitcoin and get a guaranteed payout for the work you do.  
Then you are working for a reward not gambling millions of times a second for the chance of a reward.
You would not need mining pools to boost your chance of winning the bitcoin mining lotto.

Actually it's not you only mine when know there is a seam or oil field.  And even the exploratory mining makes heavy use of science to refine their search areas.
Maybe if bitcoin used a virtual world and procedurally generated seams of coins and miners can choose where to mine.  Then it would be like mining.
So a random chance at a win when you work the 'lever' after spending money (kw/h + hardware) is by definition gambling.

It does not take into account time, the travel time of the data, the processing speed of the miner or the cost to the miner vs the reward.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:55:56
Decentralisation assumes all things are equal and they are not.
For instance the distance and bandwidth a transaction travels to the miner creates a travel time.  The speed and amount of work the miner has creates a queuing and processing time element.
Also decentralisation assumes all transactions are equal and again they are not, some transactions can require faster processing times than others and the value of the transaction can vary greatly.
Also the cost of processing to the miner would ideally be a factor so they can avoid wasting electricity on loss transactions.
In theory you could have a more efficient transaction network if you incorporated these factors into it's operation.

Useless argument as until the Earth stops turning or the Sun shining they are guaranteed to produce electrons daily.  The only random element is daily variability.  Note seasonal and longitudinal variability can be accounted for.

Look at it another way do actually miners pay to work and only get paid a random amount for their work depending how lucky they are.
You shouldn't even call it mining you should call it gambling!

Is mining just gambling?

The subtle difference that I think is important is a speculator invests something and obtains something of equal value at that point in time.  They have not technically lost anything in that moment.
Over time the value of their investment can rise or drop.
This is not the same as a bitcoin miner who is spending money (kwh + hardware + time) on something that may not pay out.  
Statistically they should earn something over time but as long as the mining reward mechanism is random in nature and not related to work then you are gambling.
It should be easy to fix, just give miners a fixed hourly wage per transactions processed or a tiny percentage of the value of the transaction as a processing fee (similar to the robin hoods tax proposed for Wall St.).
