I like your style.

on Sunday? bold.

not to fight you on your main point, but assuming you put 10k down on a 25k car at 5 years at 0.9 apr, your 60 payments of about $324 add up to 19k plus your downpayment of 10k. so the cost of financing would be closer to 5k rather than $450.

For real. I am handling much less but I still found it worthwhile to get a ledger nano s. Better safe than sorry. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:55:16
I know them feels.

I'm a mog. I'm my own best friend. 
We'll see you again in Bitcoin 2: the search for ~~are~~ more money.

Did slaves not eat the master's food and sleep in the quarters provided for them?

Copay is a legacy (non segwit) wallet, iirc, and they will charge you a significant fee. I just moved my coin from copay to a ledger nano s and it cost me about $14usd/transaction.

yeah, I thought I was smart and researched and eventually bought a ledger nano s. right after, they had a huge problem with the migration from chrome apps and have had issues with their platform/software ever since.

this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:17:20
you are spot on with reapect to people selling btc and regretting it later. it seems to be the nature of the beast with these things. however, i'd like to hear the story with the car.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:13:01
I just don't see the need for brakes. If you plan effectively, the car will slow down naturally and stop when you reach your destination.

I'm old af. I can remember when memes were called macros and quote most of the dialogue of zero wing and this is the first Dimitri meme I've seen. Sometimes memes just slip past people.

The future is here!

Did you drop a /s or something?
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:32:33
What about that one that goes on the slide and attaches it to your belt all unsafe like?
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:44:39
I don't down vote as a personal policy, but I was surely tempted.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:41:56
Best response yet.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:43:32
Then irony is probably lost on him.
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:01:41
I just burst out laughing. My family probably thinks i went crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:47:28
this. i've sold my house, soul, blood, and pets. let's do this.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:12:16
Awesome use of punctuation.
