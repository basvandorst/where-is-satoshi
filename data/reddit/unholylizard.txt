Good time to remind yourself why we are here.


 






[*A Cypherpunk's Manifesto, 1993*](

Lol TOR and fees. Just read the context that was something about routing and definitely not about fees. By the way do you hear about L3 in LN? Main factor that will lead to well funded and decentralised network between business (big) hubs is that business will want any hypothetical customer who has just single random canal can find a route with max chance. With Schnorr and L3 fees per channel will become a joke.


Oh. So you comment on my post without reading it.. OK I can repeat that for you: 
1. *'LN can work without big hubs'*. So can your fiat working without banks? Or may be you can easily become your own Bank? I do not think so. But in LN you have a choice! If people do not run fullnode than they already trast data from 3rd parties but it is crear they have a choice.
2. *'Even if there will be big hubs they have zero control over LN'* Do banks have no control of your money?
3. *'Internet itself has big hubs so what.'*  wow Banks! Banks are everywhere!
So if you want to find Bunks - look at blockchain with blocksize scaling (in case they ever be close to touch mainstream adoption).
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:55:57
Yes they are.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:34:28
It is impossible with your conditions. 1. This is why LN is better for small payments. 2. So Alice know how much she can theoretically get from each of her channel. So she even will no try reqest more from you at first.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:39:41
Yes. And this is why it is important that any Bitcoin user must have the opportunity to run their own node. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:55:31
"Supernodes"? What are you talking about? Blocksize increase will lead to "supernodes" that is true indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:32:45
Nope. Segwit in part of blocksize increase is definitely a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:50:47
Just FUD and lie. Just name your "security attack vector". New security attack vector is trying to convince bitcoin users that they do not need full nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:40:25
By now we have Bcaas. When mining difficulty increase mining Bcash become more profitable and some miners will *move* their hash power to Btrash. &lt;- This can result in some longer bitcoin block times than usual.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:58
I'm very happy for you. It remains to convince all the others that they can do this too (and that if someone cannot then this is their own fault, not yours).
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:00:19
lol you are free to fire up your own node
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:41:45
Looks like that is you who don't know how lightning network work. Your node *does not need* to know "enough" (lol really?) other nodes. Do you know how TOR working? LN *can* work without big hubs. Even if there will be big hubs they have zero control over LN. Internet itself has big hubs so what. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:10:26
No. As I understand technically Bob first pays Charlie with his money in the Bob-Charlie channel. Only then using the pre-image from Charlie he can claim his money on the Alice-Bob channel. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:50:46


Big Blocks removes the possibility for normal users to participate Because *'A node as we know it now won't be validating the network, you won't see your tx on the ledger'*.


Normal user long ago can't participate by pointing his gpu to a pool in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:03:16
Why if someone want *to talk about bcash* just do not go to btrash sub?
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:05:35
But not for CryptoKitties. /s
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:55:23
We need "UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)" then (August 1st activation).
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:18:44
If search just "uasf", there are 27 nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:10:30
So when it is time to 2x HF there will be split on 2 chains bitcoin and altcoin. And you think it is ok to let pools allowing their users choose between it even before split. So it is ok if pools while supporting 2x also allow their "users" choose Core, right?
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:30:11
Nope. Segwit + LN will slove it. So why we need contentious HF now?
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:50:28


This is even worse. By this logic txs in bigger blocks are "unfairly cheap" fo those who happy with 1mb block.
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:49:07
Wrong. Nor miners nor Core.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:48:07
Agee. Even a dozen defectors among *dozens* does not a broken agreement make. /s
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:47:40
Lol. So much FUD. Yes let's wait and see without any contentious HF until we will clearly realise what we see. If you believe all that FUD about SW and LN than you already have your own "bitcoin" without all that "shitty core's code".
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:00:02
LOL. I use a quote to answers your question, and later, but that does not mean that all the quotes belong to you.
If I want to quote you, I'll use this:


Yes, you do not answer my question and start FUD. What responds do you want from me, if you can not even proof any of your statement?
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:19:32
Um,  how about "we do not need contentious hardfork that solves nothing?"
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:36:00
Do you think I did not give him a clear answer to his question? This question:


And when did I start attacking the person? Not when, instead of answering my question, he start spreading FUD? kek. Or do you think, spreading the FUD all around here, does he contribute alot of value to the debate?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:28:23
If pools are free to run any software they want - Segwit2x, BitcoinABC, BitcoinCore, etc than I even don't see any agreement to break to.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:04:34
Therefore, if any pool during operation on btc1 will also run Core, supported by *any* part of their hashrate, it does not violate the NYA. Am I right?
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:52:56
Hashrate will follow the market.
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:36:50
Woot? Insults? I did not even begin. You ask a question, and I just gave you a clear answer to your question. But then looks like you get buttherted and start spreading nonsense. So why do you ask questions if you are not ready to hear the answers?
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:02:01
So do I.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:21:40


So ..
1. Your pool signed NYA.
2. Ofcourse you *know* that SegWit2x - is the true Bitcoin.
3. Now while Core do not merge "2x" part in their code it's clear for you that BitcoinCore is alcoin.
4. You are free to run BitcoinCore on your pool since it doesn't mean that you broke NYA.
5. ...
6. Profit?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:47:44
Are there still bigblockers who did not go full support their altcoin Bcah? Are there still someone who interested in new B2X altcoin so I'll can increase my bitcoin hodling? I'm afraid B2X would be cost much less than BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:26:24
By 'everyone' do you mean just about 50 people who signed NYA? 'Compromise' between those who want Segwit and those who want bigger blocks? Can you opposite the statement that many who want bigger blocks left BTC to fully support BCH (someone indeed support BCH)? And if plan B for B2X supporters is BCH (as you say) this mean that most B2X supporters are bigblockers who may be already left BTC. Looks like B2X most likely intent to split bigblockers razer than Core supporters. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:36:16
Nope. A bunch of miners is not matter at all. If tomorrow 51% hashpower start mining an altcoin like bch or a new one (for example without 21M lim) all my btc still will be in safe behind my full node.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:15:00

That was a rhetorical question. SPV-nodes don't exist nowadays. We need *"fraud proof"* to be implemented first.


What are you talking about? I didn't even try to claim that.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:40:22
Wow! Becouse you are uneducated operator, not mean that the another are too. By your logic: "Miners vote is Sybil attack because miner operators are kept uneducated by reading the unleveled playing feilds of the biggest outlets for bitcoin news."  - also Sybil attack.
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:19:31
"Manual protection" just lol! Any proof?
@_date: 2017-04-14 12:48:12
Miners need to "get consensus", not Core devs.
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:10:22
If some miners want to configure their asics to mine shitcoins (thus no longer mining bitcoin), that's their preregotive.  Network is not effected at all by any invalid block coming from miners.
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:51:40
yes, if miners that want their BTU alt-coin just forkoff it will help BTC indeed, but they don'd
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:02:09
So Bitmain either idiots or just liars.
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:31:56


1. Can I ask for Satoshi quote on this?
No matter how low tx fee is, if user cannot run full node he even can't get any user experience in bitcoin either. Or maybe spv-nodes already exist?
2. I see the trend too and my common sense tell me you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:21:12
For the same reason as now. LN does not force you to do only lightning transactions, usres can freely choose to use more secure onchain transactions. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:08:24
And no a word about BU? Looks like BU now officially RIP. UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:14:56
lol So we still don't have shitty flextrans all becouse Core devs?
"What miners?"
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:59:51


A small group of companies still hasn't realize they represent zero users in such agreements like NYA. They are minority who will find themself with their S2X altcoin when they forkoff in Nov. Good luck. And thanks for free BTC :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 10:28:11
Need to wait, when all of them will begin to explain their positions.
For example, here is a statement from some big exchangers about Bitcoin Unlimited hardfork, which also did not have replay protection  (Mar 17, 2017. yes, someone never learn from history)
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:30:41


Lol. NO. The minority chain is no longer bitcoin by design, only if it follows the same rules as majority. Only my own full node decides were is the majority *bitcoin* chain and *this* is literally written into the whitepaper. 
But thank you for ability to increase my BTC hodling for 'free'.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:44:57


Ok. Let's see. For example miners with 51+% hashrate want forking bitcoin to remove 21M lim without replay protection. Can we agree I'm personally have right to treating such activity as 'attack'? If so, whitepaper literally says my bitcoins are safe behind my full node.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:06:49
Yes. It is SegWit. Now we do not need another '2X'. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:59:05
Lol. And he really believes that his 'patch' is the true bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:10:57
Why do I want to follow greedy miners and bunch of CEOs who want to attack bitcoin with contentious hardfork without replay protection?
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:18:55


Lol. Innovations on the BTC chain will happen much faster if we become free from Bitmain.
And I wonder what innovations he is talking about? About those like SegWit? But isn't Bitmain the main cause of stalling?
Or about those like BU which indeed very quickly went to "prodaction ready" release. Good luck them.


majority hashrate != majority support. So from community vision upcoming hardfork is the same with 'free' S2X coins.
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:42:43
Miners are going to fork themselves off and it does not matter how many PoW they have.
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:27:27


B2X is exectly consequence free money like bcash.


Wallets are not so important. Coinbase.. where can I read Coinbase statement about how they will handle upcoming hardfork that has no replay protection? 


So at the *worst* case they are going to steal original BTC from their users (nope. at worst aliens will destroy Earth), and if market will "wote" for legacy chain and all miners return to legasy chain what will Coinbase do? Sorry but I dont see how stealing BTC from users will help them takeover of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:53:23
Nope. It's exactly ordinary bigblocker's logic.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:23:29
I think I have right to choose any chain I want. If someone want to make my chain unuseble resulting I loose money how isn't it an 'attack'?
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:19:47
Than just sell them their shitcoin at high price and stay free.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:21:20
If they are going to blindly follow the chain with more PoW (that is default 'neutral' position for all spv-wallets) how do they actually support s2x?
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:05:11
Yes, but miners will not follow S2X chain. Intention to follow S2X chain is not part of NYA agreement. ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:21:53
Agreement behind closed doors to make 51% attack on bitcoin is not *public, consensus based forks*.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:07:26
Yes. SegWit is a blocksize increase. Just now we do not need another one (whats the meaning to have any limit as spam filter if any times when spammers hit that limit we will increase it??)
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:47:52
Lol. Chicken logic from forkers. Don't they have NYA? Don't they have 95% miners? Don't they believe segwit2x is just a bitcoin upgrade? Yes then B2X is dead indeed.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:47:52


It is *now* takeover attempt. I think S2X will not happen, and if it does, it will quickly end in altcoin like BCH. I don't see any from top exchanges who agree to steal BTC and leave their users with S2X crap. We do not even have clear statements from Coinbase - and they are going to takeover Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:07:29
SegWit is on the way. I can wait and I want to see and understand its effect before next block size pump. And S2X even further from 2X, it will be altcoin like BCH, not bitcoin upgrade.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:55:15
Can you exlpain me why 2x better than 100x? 
*Because idiots following the altcoin B2X dev without a real reason why 2x is better than 100x are the ones slowing it down. When people realise B2X solves nothing, they'll drop it.*
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:14:38


Nope. It is attack. 


But it works. This is why many do not want to change it now. But miners are free even every day start mining any new fork that breaks the consensus rules - and it will be altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:06:59
It is not *jast an increase to 2mb block*. Just answer me: why x2? Why not x1.5? Or even x3? Isn't x3 better than x2? Or why just don't wait and see how SegWit will take its effect? If you still really need your SegWit2x coin you will get it soon.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:02:01




Wrong. *If segwit2x were to hypothetically gain majority support then what will happen is that* we will change B2X shotcoin to Bitcoin at great price. And if miners do not want to work on our chain we will find others. Simple.
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:57:09
Nope. S2X can be an altcoin and will be if miners fork in Nov. Lack of Replay Protection is just a headache for exchanges, wallets and not educated users, who can loose their funds, but nothing more. It does not matter whether there is Replay Protection or not - after contentious hardfork (which is S2X) there will be 2 different chains: one alcoin and one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:22:19
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:41:48
Yes, exactly *we don't need a 3rd bitcoin altcoin* which is B2X. But if they want it anyway it's better to do with replay protection unless they want people loose money.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:16:52
Yes, it seems that RSK is ready since September, and the delay is caused by this S2X drama.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:10:31
Miners can believe in everything they want. If they do not agree to do the work we are ready to pay, we can fire them. If they are afraid of even UASF then after a little mention of PoW change they will return faster than light (but I'm not sure that I'll want them back).
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:27:10
So go and release that code, what is a problem? Not forget for deep testing. We will wait. Then we will run your code or may be not, who knows.. And if you need some money ask miners, they (not devs) get paid for their work by protocol.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:44:00
Nope. He say "support SW", not "activate SW". We still need 95% hashrate to activate segwit now.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:25:25
SegWit IS a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:22:10
So what? You are not forced to use it. Only if you think it's worth it.
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:53:00
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:58:03


When you mention devs you are talking about DASF not UASF.


Lololol Any proof? SegWit is the best for bitcoin scaling part.


Just lie.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:22:37


Lol are you kidding?


I'm actually surprised Luke continued to support the agreement as much as he did after miners broke it.
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:44:04
Is it because he has no bitcoins at all?
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:03:43


True. I choose not upgrade my node to accept bigger blocks. I can waiting fo LN as much as needed.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:19:15


To avoid chain split it needs 51% hashrate. Contentious HF even on 95% hashrate = chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:10:59
If you want big blocks you are free to fork off at any time. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:56:52
I just answered a simple question. Why are you trying to sell me that BS? UASF (BIP148) still has two months.  ? Most have not yet expressed their opinions and there is still time to change. And after BIP148 we have BIP149, yes it's UASF too.


Lol. Exactly you talk about all those BU (EC), BtClassic, XT supporters altogether. So here we are with one solid 1 Mb block lim. chain. I still can deal with it for as long as needed to achieve: 


@_date: 2017-05-16 14:41:11


Looks like it is not such necessary. A huge number of hashrate (about 25-30%) still does not signal any proposal.

But if Satoshi was a devil then bitcoin can return to papa.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:33:26


Nope. You still need proof. Without proof you just *believe* in. Or just trying FUD.


First, SegWit is x2 equivalent block size increase. And no, they avoid unnecessary contentious hardfork with all the risk dander and harm such hardfork can do to bitcoin.


How you measure that "large part". Anyway that is not their fault. They just offered one (well tested and ready for launch today) of solutions. Users (and even miners) are *free* to chose *any solution* they believe the best for bitcoin. 


Too fat. lol. You clumsily try to contrast the developers and the community.. must try harder. Despite the fact that SegWit solves real problems, (I will speak for myself but I know I'm not alone) I want to fix malleability much more than trying dangerous hardfork.


Most of them are ready for segwit  


Let’s look at top "goodness" of contentious hardfork:
1. Before HF price will dump with all panic sells and tears and snot.
2. Chain spit. All dumps and pumps on both chains and tears and snot.
3. In case lazy HF devs didn't implement wipeout protection and peplay protection (like BU) so that *all* users would have to bother to learn what that terms even mean, and must learn how to safely manage their coins. But not only users - all devs of wallets and exchanges must do some hard work to protect their users.
No, thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:25:34
Lol, yeah! And do not forget miners lied about support core code part. Why would we expect this time to be different?
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:37:55


No. SegWit as a safe softfork is desperately needed and great for Bitcoin, both now and long term.

Wow! I didn't agree on any compromise. I didn't signed any compromise. I had running my uasf node before any compromise between corporates who can eat my shorts, I dont care. So do I sabotage "this" compromise only by my own choice to run code I want?
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:29:05
I do not see any deadline in NYA. So how they will determine whan S2x fail or not? And there are no any conditional words like 'fail' or 'uasf' in their statement.

Behind your "sceptical" there is nothing but FUD, so yes here we are.
@_date: 2017-05-16 06:57:26


In that special case where there is not enough user (including exchengers, wallets, etc) support like what we have by now, I bet there are no crazy miners which will mine UASF chain.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:31:02
Elaborate please.
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:51:40
Nope. Implement Segwit as well tested and much safer for upgrade solution now, and HF whan it will be needed later.

Lol. They will never do this becouse they know their new created *altcoin* will be rejectet by the whole network, and no one true bitcoin will be lost even if they try. Miners are just workers.
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:24:03
Nope, there are no chain split while honest miners have 51% hashrate. Old nodes will follow chain with more PoW.

Yes. It can solve this

Ok, lets look at what amount of relevant "technical" discussion in your comment.


"If" ?? Such a wary "technical" word .. Do you want I google "SegWit benefits" for you?


Nope, It's only seems. It's may be "amount of complexity" for BU devs indeed .. How even can you measure that "amount"?


And again dat "technical" "if." Ok, by your words: If further capacity increases do not require HF, why do we want to risk chain split now?


Which "logic"? My logic dictates we must avoid HFing while we have others more safe ways to deal with.


Lol. There are no ways to do "simple" hardfork. Ask miners why.


FUD. There is nothing of "technical" discussion with that statement.

You are trolling just now. 
Also, just because you don't think you were trolling doesn't make it so. You do not communicate technical facts in the exchange above but just cry around.

Their statement is just FUD. The misinformation saying it was the miners who easily can choose any consensus rules they want is the real boolshit. Unfortunately, hash power is the only thing protecting us from a doublespend. Voting by hashpower can be easily faked by miners themselves. All what we can trust by now is our own full nodes.

This. Science win again.
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:57:18
Ha, looks like only you must reread it! That part where not honest greedy miners can have above 51% hashrate (8 chapter). Oh, wait.. Is it literally says business may not want to blindly follow hashrate and this case they can only trust their own node?
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:05:06
Yes, in "CryptoMarket. The Game" looks like investors have win-win long-term situation - if they choose just one Coin invest to. But if everyone will just run around from one altcoin to another for bigger short-term income - it's like trying to cheat another - someone will definitely loose.

Agree. But "difficult" on minority chain is not so important. Minority chain will need another fork because if S2x fork with more 80% hashrate (just to save miners faces and without the community consensus) it is clear that bitcoin with PoW is broken. There are no way I will support legacy chain and be happy waiting another "closed door miner face-saver agreement" or all time waiting when some crazy miners decide to attack legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:29:46
Nope. If Core merge x2 it is not fine, it is still chain split, and if not Core there are may be other devs who will support minority chain. If you, I or that guy do not support 2x HF we must conclude that 80-90% miners do things wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:08:09
Looks like Chain B has a clear rule No.1 "Hashrate is the law". And as I understand if minority miners on chain B do not agree with a HF, they cannot send any ChainB2 bitcoins to ChainA. If they want to, thay must fork themselves off from ChainA to ChainA2 as well.

SegWit does fix layer 1 *and* it helps some more things. Layer 2 is not *less* secure layer.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:26:14
Layer 2 has much more security than needed for all coffe txs.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:30:05
Lucky there no any 'Core' in NYA.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:29:16
Lucky you! SegWit expand the block size.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:38:28
So much FUD. Sorry but you've lost me.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:52:43
If not merged, it is obvious that the 80-90% miners are wrong or corrupt or either and therefore POW is broken. So in this case, Core most likely change POW I believe.
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:24:30
Lol. Some 'miners' were not honarable in HKA first. By the way if you agree that there are no any 'Core' in NYA why you and miners continue to blame them now?
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:53:11
So what?
