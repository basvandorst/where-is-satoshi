Lol nice comeback, how long did that take you? Wasted your total intelligence capability of the day on that one.

This is why Americans are behind in everything.  Not a single American can step their game up to this level. 
But they are good at getting butt hurt and down voting. Let's see.

The fact that they are the same length means you need padding. If you hash a smaller string than the hash length you pad it. Duh. I don't know how the hash for bitcoins work but if it were so idiotically insecure I'd be able to fucking ruin that entire economy in a week.

The buffer added at the end of a padded key except this time it's the words "Send" and "Nudes" instead of some nounce or  0's etc. I'm trying to say "Send" and "Nudes" are the padding to keep the hash the required length.

Google Hash tables and how they work. It's too much to explain...

A padding is part of the result of a hash. I don't think you understand what padding is... I code algorithms for hashes, you pad small values to make them fit size requirements. Very simple concept, it's done to prevent clues to the original value. If you're terrible at hashing you would hash to the same length as the input and give us hackers a way to break the code. I'll know frequent three letter hashes are the word the, and one letter hashes the letter 'I'. I could use that to reverse engineer the hash code and make fake cryptos and steal everyone else's. 
   Secondly hashes are by definition not to be made to show any of the original content. Passwords are hashed. How would you feel if you saw your password being transferred with half of it in plain text for everyone to see. If it's a word I could easily guess the other half. Basically shouldn't even have wasted time hashing. Not to say I haven't seen stupid people hash like that but that's likely not how Bitcoin would has because too many smart people use that and would absolutely wreck the whole thing in one week of release. If you want to be funny you could use a padding with words that overlay into the original content (otherwise you show how long the original content was.)

Nah bro, that's a blatant collision of a hash table and wouldn't be allowed nor secure. Even 10 Year olds can hack something like that. Probably a salt that adds a buffer
