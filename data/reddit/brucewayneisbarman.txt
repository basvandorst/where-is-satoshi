This is awesome, I didn't know this! I guess so much of what is talked about is just the exchange rate, and where people can use Bitcoin that I missed this somehow (I follow Bitcoin news only casually).
Thanks for you kind response.

If you knew me in person, this would be hilarious. Anyway, carry on with your crusade of enlightening idiots! See^you^^on^^^the^^^^other^^^^^side!

Thanks for your response. I was under the impression that one needed to buy at least 1 BTC and I am glad to hear that is not the case! 
Oh man, my own smidge of BTC! Haha! You're awesome! :D

I'm the kind of person who thinks about things in all aspects, including philosophical. Based on my misinformation, I came up with some curious dwellings and I put them onto a subject-related subreddit to see what the more informed persons thought about it. 
If I had been right in anything I said, I think that this kind of disproportionate wealth would be a very important discussion point for those involved with Bitcoin for philosophical reasons (anti-mainstream banking). However, I have already been shown that my starting point was wrong and so, of course, were my musings.
Do you have something to add to this, or do you have some problem with just downvoting the thread as a whole and moving on? You really needed to come all the way in here, and respond to a comment where I was thanking someone for their help, to call me an idiot? Sounds like you are a thought-provoking, kind, and helpful person. Have fun in life.
edit: removed implication that u/bettercoin thought of only me as an idiot, as comment history indicates that there are lots of idiots out there.

As a lurker, I wondered this, too.

If you are referring to me, then I apologize for being an idiot, and please note that my misconceptions have been fixed.
Follow up question: why do jerks feel the need to call people looking for information idiots?

Yes, I was confused. I understand it better now because of how divisible 1 BTC can actually be. I wasn't thinking clearly. :)

I won't argue with you there. I was misinformed. Heaven forbid that ever happens.

Thank you very much for the advice! I will definitely check it out!

This is why I would like to start investing - not only because of the capital, but just for the new skill set. It's hard to teach yourself (or, I should say, it's difficult for me to teach myself) about Bitcoin since I have limited programming and monetary experience. But, I want to learn!
If you don't mind me asking, did you have someone advising you about when/where to invest?

Thank you very much for the information. I will definitely read through this thread and hopefully start making my first purchases very soon!
