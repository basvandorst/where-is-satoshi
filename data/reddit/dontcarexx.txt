So the wealth that's supposed to be generated from bitcoin, is not going to be given to the wealthy that have a mass amount of it, because the wealthy bought bitcoin?

Please troll some more.

I would love to see you try to explain to the IRS random and large lumps of cash you have suddenly acquired if you decide to actually cash out on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:41:02
Are they using it as a currency though? You make me laugh

Seems like you don't understand the purpose of bitcoin, you know where the door is. You and everyone who thinks bitcoin isn't for people who make less than $2 a day are ruining bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:58:28
That's like asking, "why do you want to use bitcoin as a currency? Just use USD!" 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:32:52
Don't expect people to adopt a horrible currency.

If you getting more money than you put in means that wealth is going to be massively distributed from the mega rich to others, you are seriously fooling yourself. Just because you're making money, doesn't mean that the rich are losing it.

Don't use the supposed currency of the future? The one that everyone on this sub is heralding as the destroyer of banks? How do you expect to do that when you're encouraging people to not use it?

I mean, a whole lot of spends its time hating every and all bitcoin fork for daring to attempt to change the way bitcoin works. Even if you heavily "invest" in bitcoin, you should still keep note of other currencies.

You're kidding yourself if you think the wealthy don't have a massive amount of the bitcoin out there.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:09:36
Goddamn you are an obvious troll.

When did I ever insinuate that? Is it too much to ask for the supposed cryptocurrency of the future to actually be viable as a currency? Do you pay $12 extra on a $10 sandwich every time you go to subway? Do you have to wait hours on end before your purchase is confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:05:54
Even a few $ is too much for a currency, do you have to pay $3 every time you buy a $1 pack of gum?

And they put in 1 million and got back 50 million. Wealth will not be transferred away from the wealthy. Just instead of 1% of the population having 80% of the wealth, it will be 1.5% having 90% of it.

And this recent surge has set the precedent that it shouldn't be used as a viable currency. Right now it's essentially a stock market with only one stock.

And the bubble gets slightly larger
