Wow, that is a good point. Have you considered NFC as a method of delivering the BTC address?  I am not sure if any Android Bitcoin clients support it, so this may be beyond the scope of what you want to do.  It will make the people purchasing from your vending machines look more natural.

The second confirmation feels unnecessary.  He also looked clumsy scanning the QR code.  I think the touchscreen should be raised higher.

I do not see how this flash exploit on bitcointalk.org demands I pay special attention to my wallet.dat.  I think that claim is bogus and just increases paranoia in the community.

Imagine you ran a public wifi hotspot.  From that situation you could control via firewall what peers bitcoin users on your wifi were able to connect to, and which ones they were not.
If I ran a pawn shop I could offer to pay customers via bitcoin.  If my router noticed a customer attempting to download the blockchain (based on ports, ip address, or deep packet analysis) on my wifi, **I drop all packets coming from non-corrupted nodes, and tell the fake nodes to start writing this transaction on the spoof blockchain.**  The victim downloads the blockchain from the spoofs with the two symptoms of slower confirmation time and some timeouts on internet connections. He can sit there until he gets 10000 confirmations, and **when he walks out and connects to a legit host he'll find the longer bitcoin blockchain and switch over.  I keep his bitcoins and his goods.**  I don't have to deal with individual vulnerabilities that may exists in various clients.  
**If he uses VPN he escapes detection** and I would send the transaction to the legitimate blockchain and we would have a fair deal.  
Now imagine you were an ISP and wanted to scale that attack.  
Or a *government*. 
I agree with your words "*highly unlikely*" but it is *technically feasible*.  
EDIT: The blockchain is the blockchain.  That cannot be faked without being longer the the official one.  It appears that the only way to grow a blockchain is by hashing.  So the longest blockchain if the official blockchain, and the official blockchain is the one with the most mhash.  The best time for someone to attack this would be if they had early access to powerful quantum computers, but if bitcoin lasts that long than it will be a success IMO.

Minimizing the cost of online vendors is of real-world value.  
Trade Hill charges 0.25%-0.75% commission.
Dwolla charges 25 cents a trade.  
I have had no problem with .03 BTC for the bitcoin transaction fee, which is about 50 cents.
Ebay + PayPal charges 6-9% commission.  Even if you trade on a downturn and lose 5% of the USD value on your bitcoins, it is still better than PayPal.  
The real trick would be to take advantage of this in small businesses, where Visa and MasterCard charge 3-7% to make payments.  Cash in hand is the best for real world transactions, but bitcoin is primarily competing with digital currencies and method of transferring value.  
@_date: 2011-08-23 22:07:23
Yup, but if the client was compromised it would be possible to control which nodes they connect to.

The only evidence is the BTCGuild statment claiming they banned a botnet and their stated hunch that the botnet was DDosing, and the sudden large sale.

Someone could attempt a temporary and localized attack with less resources on clients that only read the headers of the block chain.  However 120 confirmations on the block chain is as set in stone as P2P gets (for now).

100,000 mhash would give someone a confirm in 24hours.  Spoofing that for 1 transaction is a bit steep because in that 24 hours someone could mine 50 bitcoins, or $550.
The official bitcoin client supports socks4 proxy, which would do the job in a quick ISP level port block.  However all nodes that publish domain names are vulnerable to DNS level blocks.  I wonder if there are alternative addresses set up for deepbit.net and btcguild.org (together they have 750,000 mhash)

By offering bitcoins as a payment method when it makes sense (online) you are showing your support.  I suppose if you wanted to, you could accept bit bills.

1)   If that happened today, we would see the start of mandatory transaction fees by the end of the week.  Which would help the miners the most, and hurt high frequency traders within the blockchain the most.  
2)   If the encryption gets hacked (Either from a crack in SHA256 or Quantum computers) the blockchainn could move to a different encryption.  It would be a bumpy transition.  The damage done will depend on how early the community spots exploit.

250 Ghash won't make much difference to the BTC network.  I think the difficulty is so high that these people are just playing around with their ghashs because of how little it's worth to the BTC network.  Also 250Ghash would be enough to see a drop in difficulty, and everyone will like that.

If I had 400,000 btc, I'd spend 10,000 on a bounty for a higher security implementation  of the btc client.  Why?  Because that would raise the value of BTC by more than 2.5%, thus increasing my wealth.  
@_date: 2011-07-05 16:55:07
I wonder if this attack will lower the difficulty.  DDos for profit instead of lulz?  It's a more profitable use of a botnet than using it to CPU mine.
EDIT: Replaced "better" with "more profitable"

Couldn't a person write in a discount for gold.  
For example, if you pay me in gold, the gold I want is 33% less in value than the USDs I will accept.  That way Gold isn't required, but greatly encouraged. 
@_date: 2011-07-05 23:13:01
In this case, the only advantage of the DDos for a bitcoin seller would be the bitcoins tied up in mining accounts that would hit the market place in the case of a slow crash.

Merged mining is a great idea.  It lets other blockchains piggyback their security against the bitcoin blockchain.  
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:51:54
My guess is someone was using a botnet to CPU mine, and the mining pools black-listed him.  That person is cashing out, and is using the botnets to DDos the mining pools in order to deter other people from undercutting him.  Of course this has a rippleing effect, in part because it effected large pools, and also because large sells lowers the BTC-&gt;USD exchange rate, and these things effect other people's decisions to buy/sell/mine/hold.
@_date: 2011-08-23 12:38:08
There are attack situations that do not relay on having 51% of the total hashing power, and if someone has 51% then the attack may or may not be temporary.
