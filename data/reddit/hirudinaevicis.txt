Coinbase was a major PITA to set up, but I have been using for
a year or so with no problem. I don't care if it takes a week.
I'm using BC to buy stuff so it doesn't really matter if it takes
a week. I just plan ahead. I buy a couple or 3 in advance to use. I don't care about small price fluctuations. If I were trying
to "play" to make profit I'd have to go elsewhere. Coinbase is predictable and reliable. I don't mind the wait enough to go elsewhere. Of course I'd like it to be immediate but not that big a deal. If more folks thought as I do it might add to BC stability

You are joking, correct? It might be fun to see the argument
how this might fit into the myth, but I don't get the connection even if there was a god and the bible were real.

Hoping the price will rise like it did last year

It was kind of a hassle to get set up,but Coinbase works well for me

A way to recover privacy in financial transactions. A way to get back to a value of exchange not controlled by any government. Back when currency represented the value
of work is where I like to go back to. When all mediums 
of exchange got cut loose from representing something of real value, like gold, currency became too easily manipulated. Since bitcoin is outside of government, for now
it is manipulated equally by the world. It levels the playing field sort of. I'm really old, I never even had a credit card
until I was way over 50. I was a responsible hard working man. I paid my house off, cars off and I couldn't even get credit. I always paid legal cash to keep it simple. I was looked at like I was a criminal because I lived like that.
So bitcoin provides a level playing field, privacy and I think eventually stability. Naw it isn't gold, but eventually it will
I hope become a solid standard, like precious metals used to be. A stable, private medium of exchange. I'm just  a dumb old retired guy, so tear this apart. Maybe I'll learn

I'm for the change. I never used a darkmarket, but bitcoin
is about freedom. When all of one's financial transactions
become controlled and traceable by government and even the
value of the medium of exchange is controlled by government
any semblance of freedom is gone. A free market is a free market. If it involves things outside of government approval
that's a good thing. Since when has prohibition of anything
accomplished anything of value.

I just love the line that says:I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans,” said Polis.
Look at all the Sumptuary laws that have been created to
"protect" people from themselves that just remove personal
freedom and responsibility, transferring all individual power
to government. I have a great deal more fear of government
than getting ripped off because I failed due diligence learning.

They were no help getting connected to a bank account. Took many
tries to get it to work. It works now. I have sent money to my derelict
relative and purchased stuff. No problem yet.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:15:24
I use it. It works fine. It was a damn pita to set up though.

I'm glad people are using Bitcoin but Intuit is one of the 
most PITA companies I've ever dealt with. I did it for a group of 15 doctors that used QB for parts of the operation.
Intuit made you give a credit card number before support
would even talk to you. Then they told me I would have to pay whether they could fix the problem or not. It was a bug in the program and they still charged me. 6 hours on usenet and some elbow grease fixed the problem despite
friggin Intuit. Another time the server crashed and I had to go through hours of bullshit to make sure we had "legit" copies of the software, This was a while back but every time I see Intuit in any article a cascade of hate flows.

kaotic, thanks that looks like some will work for me, at the least until
Coinbase gets responsible, or perhaps as a replacement for Coinbase.
Exactly what I was looking for. If any 3 sources work at any given time, I'm covered to start using BTC as a reliable alternative to
gov. currency
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:32:53
Thanks elozor. I guess I'll attempt a try to do it as you did.
I'm an old curmudgeon and HATE fiddly crap like this, however bitcion is the future of personal economic freedom.
The new "war on cash" is pissing me off. I have ALWAYS paid my taxes, been a good citizen ( now a senior citizen ) and I resent the hell out of the fact that since I use cash
for everything, I'm now looked at like a criminal, so I see a bad thing coming down the line. Bitcoin looks like the new economy of freedom and I want to figure it out. After the economic collapse in 2008, I'd like way to run my economic
life free from governments controlling the value. That's why the US banned gold at the transition way back when. Anyway despite the PITA I'd like to coldstore some bitcoin.
I have gold in a safety deposit box that may never matter.
I'd like to have the same amount in BC stored on a drive. 
Just in case. If it is going to really work as a currency, it has
to be a little bit less of a hassle. The folks that find a way to sell it online Easily with even a 10 day wait and a fee wil clean up for a while

Thanks I get it now. I'd much rather have my coin here, rather than
"out there". I have a decent IP chains firewall that does stateful packet
inspection. Should I always wait for the sync until I do anything?
I plan on getting 400 bucks to start. What is the best way to do that?
I hear Walmart even.How do you buy bitcoin?

reflexfelix Oh gawd yet another thing I don't get, sigh
I just took a reliable old linux box that I was going to put my wallet on. Transfer my bitcoin to it and take it off the internet. Then I was going to send bitcoin I was going to spend from that to my regular box. So the "safe box" would only be online to get bitcoin transfers. I was going to "store"
my large amount there. Damn I guess I don't really understand yet. Does what I was going to do make any sense?
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:29:03
Thanks. I've never heard of Google Voice. I'll look into it.
I'm just pissy about the fact that Coinbase didn't give one shit about killing my account without warning. BTC needs to be easier to get if it's going to be the new world medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:10:24
 LOL since I cannot even get BC yet perhaps where to store them is moot,heh
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:34:23
Do most people keep their bitcoin in a wallet on a PC, or
in an online location like an exhange? If on a PC can you not
just keep your BC on a removable drive when not spending them?

electronic / direct deposit routing number did not seem
to work. It was the first thing I chose. I got the email
from Coinbase, logged on to my bank website and
no transactions showed up. Keep in mind, and sorry I didn't
mention it before, it is a SAVINGS acccount. I don't have
a checking account with this bank. I opened the account
just to keep it separate and at a different bank than my normal bank. I opened it a long while ago for another reason
so I thought it prudent to use it in case I run into ID theft or something. So perhaps I should add a checking account to it.
I never even had a credit card until I was over 50. I always
just used cash for everything. I like my life to be simple.
So what is the general opinion on the "give out your password" to instant verify? Sounds really Stupid. I only have 1500 buck in the account, but I could take it down to
100 bucks, verify and change all the logon info. Cripes what a PITA. I would have gotten into BC a long time ago if it were easier to get going
