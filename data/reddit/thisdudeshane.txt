No, I didn't pay with crypto. I paid with USD.
I'M SO FURIOUS. THEY WON'T SEND ME MY MONEY BACK. 
Does anyone speak Mandarin that would be willing to help me figure this out?

I will never work with Bitmain again. I've been talking with their HORRIBLE customer service for the past five months. I sent them $1600 dollars, they have receipt and have confirmed they have the money on their side, they refuse to go through with my order, and won't refund me my money. At this point, Bitmain has stolen $1600 USD from me. I'm more than furious with their complete disrespect of their customers.

I'm not doing horribly financially, but $1600 is a lot of money regardless.... It's hard to bite the bullet on this one...

Thank you for the luck, I will need all I can get.
I'm really looking for some help if anyone can give me a hand.

I didn't pay with BTC or BCH, I paid with USD.

Their reason was literally that do a refund would be too difficult for their finance department.    I've spoken to my bank, they can't do a recall because the payment was a wire transfer of USD, not a debit/credit charge.

I tried this with my bank. They sent a total of 5 requests to their bank in China over the course of 1.5 months and never received any comments back from the bank.

Hopefully the other comments I've posted have cleared up the situation.   I'm still looking for any possible help in righting this wrong.

I've talked to my bank, they've essentially resigned to not being able to help me. My only option would be an international lawyer, which would definitely be more than $1600... :(

I am absolutely certain that I went through the actual Bitmain website, their customer support just won't provide me with a refund.

Their excuse was literally: "Do a refund is too difficult for our financial department."

I placed the order and sent them the USD via a wire back at the beginning of September 2017. At that point in time they were accepting USD via wire transfers only. Shortly after I sent them the money (maybe a month or so) they announced that they would no longer be accepting USD, only BCH.
