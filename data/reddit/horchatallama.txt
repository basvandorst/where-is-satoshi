If you used AES you’d still have to write down the private key for that, you’re just adding an insecure device(your computer) to the process, making it less safe except to someone who knows you have words somewhere and have bitcoin, but can’t hack you, like a relative/SO. But you can protect the words from someone close to you without involving a computer, like with a really basic cypher based on a single passphrase or something just for obsfuscation to slow someone down

Transaction confirmation time doesn’t matter to a vendor selling inexpensive stuff because they can see the transaction was made immediately, no need to wait for confirmations for a coffee or something. They wait longer for visa to clear, like 2-3 days even. Visa does confirm that the buyer has enough in their account at the time of purchase, but I don’t know enough about bitcoin to know if it can offer a similar feature.

Understand that Coinbase can freeze your assets at any time if they think your BTC was involved in something against their TOS, even if it's false or you weren't the one who did it. Lots of horror stories about that. Don't keep more than you use for day trading or a Shift card or what not.

I think the way to look at it instead is why is ETH different? I think the answer to that is because ETH has its own applications and it’s newer. LTC tracks BTC like most altcoins because BTC is the reserve currency for crypto and LTC generally has the same application

More likely if you were a fiat business you’d implement it through a payment processor who converted to fiat at the time of exchange for you. Coinbase already does this with Shift cards.

I was just looking at gdax since release. But remember if you are comparing another coin you want to look at price in BTC because the whole market has similar movements due to trading between coins. At best it’s holding steady with BTC except for the occasional pump and dump

Seems pointless to attack bitcoin like they are doing. Best they will do is suppress the price a little and slow down development in the US while the rest of the world moves on. They're only delaying the inevitable

The demand has always come in cycles. It’ll be low for awhile until some good news comes out. Probably once some significant progress is made on the development side. Low demand will help kill off the weaker coins too, btc will survive and come back stronger once they die

It got a wakeup call when BTC crashed the other day but recovered. People must see it as having its own value. I did at first but I’m starting to question it. Most of its useful features will come to bitcoin itself before too long.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:30:13
Not sure they're right about miners, since miners would mostly be interested in increasing the amount they make off transactions with raising fees or bigger blocks. Real businesses making money off a crypto probably would give it more value though. Bitcoin's long term value depends heavily on the technology developed for it though, by devs.

From what I understand, Segwit basically reduces the size of outgoing transactions, and fees are paid in sat/byte, so if you are sending from segwit to anywhere, your fees are the same in sat/byte but the overall fee is reduced by about a factor of two.
However, if the whole network adopted segwit, or even a significant portion of it, the blocks wouldn’t be full anymore, and the sat/byte fee would approach zero
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:02:43
Your fees go up every time you receive coins? Is that because GDAX batches your withdrawal requests?

Wouldn’t the price of bitcoin have to stabilize and stop growing at some point, exactly because it’s deflationary and represents purchasing power one for one? So the point about hoarding it is moot. If that did become a problem a new crypto can always be made and bitcoin just becomes a store of value like gold

As far as I know you just need a browser and a USB host port. For a phone that means it needs to support USB OTG, iPhone doesn't support it.
I think it's probably worth the convenience to just use a mobile phone wallet as a hot wallet at that point though. If you're traveling with an iPhone and want access to the funds on your hardware wallet in case of an emergency, you can either memorize your seed words and import it into a mobile wallet or carry a computer with USB host ports, like maybe a cheap Android with only wifi. Make sure if you buy another device that it supports USB OTG or has A type ports(like a laptop)

Ethereum has had consistent gains and doesn’t track BTC price like LTC does, so I hold some of that too even though I believe in bitcoin as a technology more, just to help stabilize my portfolio. Ethereum is seeing real world use in ICOs as they underlie the ERC20 tokens that ICOs use and are often accepted as currency on the platforms those startups are making.

They're propagated on the network instantly, so a couple seconds at worst? Might take 10-20 minutes to clear but who cares for sending a friend money, I don't mean for something like buying a car. The ACH transfer is what takes time and that always does whether you send as USD or as Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:51:30
The block size was arbitrary but you need it small enough to not outpace storage capacity for the blockchain, and big enough to handle the volume of transactions since you only get one block every ten minutes. Different cryptos have different block sizes and different block discovery rates.
