lol protoshares and my minimal electricity costs actually made me some money. i started mining btc with that card before asics existed, and after the november rise, any coins i had consolidated into btc actually paid out pretty well in the long run. but i never lost money mining with the card. just by making less than educated trade decisions

I am not part of the free energy party, so i dont know exactly. I just helped the website adminis setup a donation button. it took a day to walk them thru the process. you would think scientists would be a bit more internet savvy, but i think they spend most of their time in a warehouse testing strange systems of electronics. they claim to have a device that attaches to your homes breaker, that can greatly reduce, or eliminate your reliance on power companies, thats not solar. but aside from what i've read on their site, not much can be verified. then again i havent put a lot of time researching their claims myself. tho it is interesting that some people are actually interested in this field. what would you do if there was no electricity cost to run your mining equipment?

why not? I would rather do something potentially beneficial (and somewhat challenging as I've never used any new asic hardware before) than sit around doing nothing but filling out more job applications to a series of web portals that have a waiting list of 2million + people ready to shank you in hopes of getting the job before you. Ive literally sent job applications to EVERY company in the area in which I'm qualified to work for, and followed thru. so while i wait for calls or potential interviews. why not think about building a mining rig? at least it would be fun
