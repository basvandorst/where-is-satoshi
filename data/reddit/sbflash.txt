Dude, get laid or pick up a bottle of jergens.. On me. Send me your btc address and I'll gladly reimburse you for it.

Interesting. I thought that was just the standard fee nowadays. I'm trying to soak as much knowledge as possible now. Thx for your replies.

I can't even think of BCH at this point. I'm having a difficult enough time with this. I'm 31 years old now and feel like it's infinity more difficult understanding all of it.

Would you keep the 5 coins online or is it too risky? Back then MTgox was going down and there were hacks every day. I lost 100 coins when I reformatted my Macbook (SSD so no chance of recovery). Sucked losing my wallet.dat but we're talking $100's of dollars worth back then, not 1000's of dollars worth like today.

Thank you. I got at least that much done last night. I kept seeing GDAX everywhere so I was able to transfer to poloniex that way. I couldn't understand for the life of me why the fee was so high. Initially I thought it was Coinbase who inflated the price but I guess that is standard today. 
Is GDAX paying the fee or is this a free transfer? Back then we could either pay to have it confirmed/transferred faster but I didn't have the option today. The transfer took hours so I thought it was the free transfer.
I have a lot of reading to do today.

Interesting. Thank you for the reply. I will do more research. I should add that I'm pretty bearish about Bitcoin even though I've earned substantial returns. I can guarantee that I would've never held on this long had I known I had these bitcoins. In all likelihood I would've sold them at $300 or whatever since I definitely went through major financial hardships since then but I've worked past them.

I guess I should add that I setup an account at Poloniex because everywhere else said they were too busy to accept new registrations. I have it sitting there with 2FA enabled. Can anyone point me to any good articles? I tried doing a Google search but there's just too much information out there and Bitcoin is so much more mainstreamed nowadays. I don't know what is good info and what is bad info. 
Thx in advance.

I don't know anything about what you just said regarding scaling, bch and the rest but I logged into Coinbase for my first time in 5 years yesterday and found 5 bitcoin sitting there still. I was disgusted by seeing the $33 transaction fee since it used to only be pennies back in the day.
For what it's worth, I'm a noob and probably a perfect example of what you're referring to.
Plus it took like 8 hours to transfer money from coinbase to another company.
