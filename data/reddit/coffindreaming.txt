It's a pyramid scheme. Just examine the percentage of people who have gained wealth vs those who have gotten burned. It's never , ever returning to the highs.
Those of you still promoting bitcoin are doing it in order to get other suckers to prop you up. It's clear as day. Let's stop the bullshit

Let me know when the Tether audit is complete

David Stockman (the guy in your video) said this in regard to crypto investors earlier this year
“It’s basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash. All of these latter-day speculators will have their hands burned to a crisp, and they will learn the proper lesson.”
