The other solution is you pay once per year, and if you cancel your service, they refund the pro-rated balance.  
This requires no coinbase and is also how many non-bitcoin subscription services work, like ovh.ie for example.

Piper Wallet has a lot more features, like:
* printing BIP0038 encrypted private keys
* support for a bunch of alt-coins
* backing your keys up to a USB flash drive
* printing multiple copies of a paper wallet
* print BIP0032 seeds for HD wallets
* custom vanitygen address prefixes
Also Piper has had support for M-of-N keys through Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm for about 4 months now :)
And since Piper is powered by the Raspberry Pi which is a full computer, there's basically unlimited stuff you can do with it.  Although Piper includes Armory, Electrum, bitaddress.org and more, you can always load your own fresh copy of any bitcoin software onto the Raspberry Pi using a flash drive if you're paranoid.

I just tested it, sending 0.5 mBTC from a paper wallet that contained 1 mBTC printed by [Piper](
It worked, but it does charge a 0.1 mBTC fee without telling you.  
In case it isn't clear, paper wallet was this address: 18QcCuZcSVKn8gzYmXnxTdrpwEtKck7SBP
I'm definitely glad to have this functionality available for iOS users!  Next is to get this app to support BIP0038 encrypted private keys :-D

The app doesn't directly make the transactions on the bitcoin network.  Instead, it uses the blockchain.info API to make the transactions.  So the app itself is just doing HTTP requests to the blockchain.info API and isn't touching the bitcoin peer-to-peer network.

I would use Piper Wallet (Disclaimer: I'm the creator)
I would print 20 BIP38 encrypted paper wallets (5BTC per wallet) using the bulk print feature of Piper, printing in Remember mode so the keys are stored internally. 
 Then I would plug in 3 flash drives sequentially so the keys are backed up on all 3 drives.  I'd store the paper wallets in a safe of some kind along with 1 of the flash drives.  I'd send the other flash drive to someone I trust that lives far away.  And finally, I'd probably lock the last flash drive in the glovebox of my car or something.

There isn't really, but I've done this before so let me give you a quick write-up of the easiest way to do it (IMO):
Securely generate a bunch of keypairs using an offline machine or livecd.  Like, say, 100,000 keypairs.  Use a flash drive to transport JUST the public keys to your main development machine.  Then, erase the flash drive and copy over the whole keypairs (including the private keys this time).  Store the flash drive somewhere secure, it's your cold storage.  
Ok so now you're done with the secure environment and you don't need it anymore.  Take the public keys you stored on your development machine and put them into a DB for your website.  
When it's time for a user to pay, pull a public key from the DB and present it to the user.  Then, poll the blockchain (through blockchain.info API or manually by installing the bitcoin daemon and an open source blockchain explorer package) to check the balance of the address.  When the address contains the proper amount of coins that the user was supposed to pay, you mark it as "paid" and tell the user their payment is complete.  
And that's it, you just wrote your own Bitcoin payment gateway.  
Note: this could be improved quite a bit by using a Hierarchical Deterministic keys, since then you would only need to store a single root public key and root private key and calculate new addresses from the root public key.  
Good luck!

Hey DogePlan,
Chris here, the creator of Piper wallet.
Sorry man, I really need to hire a support person.  I've been scrambling to fulfill all the orders from Coinsummit and the Wired article about us and support tickets have taken a back seat to getting units shipped out the door.  This is still a one man operation, and I get anywhere from 5-15 support tickets a day, ranging from "What is bitcoin?" to "Can I please have a new SD card image?" to "How does Piper know that a key it generates is not already in use?"
That said, I can send you a new SD card for free or you can download the image from our website.  We post the hash of the image in multiple places so you can verify it's authenticity.
Check out  for the SD card images and hashes.  
Again, sorry man, I really need to get someone to help me with this stuff because I'm clearly overwhelmed.

This is untrue.  Piper actually uses a dedicated hardware random number generator embedded on the Broadcom SoC to create it's entropy.  This entropy is then fused with other entropy normally fed into the /dev/random entropy pool on linux, such as any mouse movement or keyboard presses and much more.  So the entropy that Piper uses is arguably higher quality.

It's not really fair to lump every single Android phone in with your one bad experience.  
That's the difference between Android and iOS.  You can try a different Android phone that doesn't have those problems you ran into.  With iOS, you're stuck with one model of phone and no options.

Great question.  We haven't been able to find Raspberry Pi Model A's recently, so we've moved to just the single model which uses the Raspberry Pi Model B.
The word out there is that the Raspberry Pi foundation will be making more Model A's in the future but when I asked, they couldn't give me an actual date.  We're definitely open to bringing it back once we can get stock of Raspberry Pi Model A's.

I do that every month, and I've frequently caught them over-charging or mis-charging me (especially phone companies).  So it's worth it to me because I get to see what I'm actually being charged, which is important.  If it's on auto-pay then I don't see the amounts and end up getting screwed.  
It's also an awareness thing.  Like "I used that much electricity last month?  How?!?!" and then I track down the offending device and save money the next month.
I suppose if you're affluent or well-off it's easy to put everything on auto-pay and forget about it, but I am not one of those people.

You could already do that with Coinbase now.  
Circle still charges fees but they hide it in the spread.  So they can say "0 fees" but then you pay a higher price to buy BTC and you get a lower fiat value when you sell BTC.

yeah, dollars and euros are volatile too!  wait, I don't ever remember the euro being worth pennies on the dollar.  Or the dollar being worth pennies on the euro.  that's probably because they are much, much less volatile than BTC.  the whole BTC economy could crash tomorrow if a vulnerability is found in the core client.  Let's just say that the probability of a vulnerability being found in the core client is higher than the dollar or euro collapsing.  
just something to keep in mind.

@_date: 2015-03-08 21:31:34
Yeah, I saw that fact, and without any citation, I think it sounds crazy. Citations make lots of things that sound crazy become totally legitimate. 
I was curious how it came to exist on the bitcoin wiki so I looked up the change and found that it was by luke-jr. 
To be clear, I just want this fact cited.  I am after the truth here and I know luke-jr does a lot of wiki editing so I thought I would call him out, asking him to please cite facts that he posts like this.  
Someone else posted a probabilistic analysis in this thread and found this fact to be untrue. I would like to know Luke-jrs reasoning and derivation for his probability that the world is destroyed in the next 5 seconds.  I only want this cited because I want the bitcoin wiki to be a trustworthy resource for new users. 
If I were a new user and I saw an extraordinary claim like they without any evidence, red flags would go up in my head. I'm coming from the perspective of someone who has to try and explain why bitcoin is not a scam when introducing people to bitcoin on a daily basis. 
I just want Luke to put the math up, that's all.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:37:03
Sure, I'm not disputing that.  I'm just asking for you to cite these facts with the numbers behind them so that the bitcoin wiki seems more trustworthy to new users.
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:06:45


Right, I'd just like a citation on the fact I posted so that the wiki seems more trustworthy to new users.
Yeah, what a coincidence that I found that page, weeks after the controversy over Luke-Jr and the bitcoin wiki and paper wallets has already passed.  Here's the redacted support request, which I'm sure you will claim is fake.  [Piper Question](

Actually, I found this page because I was looking up address collision math to reply to a support request asking about key collisions.  
I found this wonderful sounding fact and posted it because it amused me that it's not cited with any numbers to back it up.
Also please note that I haven't touched that wikipedia page (my name is not present on that Talk page you linked), and I have nothing to do with this bitcoin wiki argument.  If you look at that page it's clearly an argument between Luke and Canton.  
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:35:31

I've been giving a lot of though to the random seed.  Right now, it uses vanitygen which is seeded by /dev/random which is known to be cryptographically secure.

Price it out and you'll see it's not a bad deal.  The printer alone is $62 (no enclosure), Ras-pi model A is $30, the breakout cable for the ras-pi is $8.  It comes to $100 total, and that's not including an enclosure, and that's also soldering it yourself (most people can't solder).  Plus, don't forget the time required to build it as well.
I encourage people to build their own, and I do want to try and bring the price down by buying parts in bulk.  But right now, I don't have anywhere near enough people interested to order parts in bulk.  The more people that register their interest at piperwallet.com, the more comfortable I am buying a larger lot of parts and the cheaper the final product will be.  
If I can bring the price down, I absolutely will. 
Re: kickstarter, I applied and submitted it but I'm currently being blocked by amazon finance (required to use kickstarter) because they don't support "financial intermediaries".

Great question!  I'm happy to provide the instructions to build an installation image, but you can really just grab the Raspbian distro for Raspberry Pi and throw the Piper python files on it and you're basically good to go.  You'll also want to install the kernel module to support the hardware RNG built in to the Raspberry Pi and apt-get some python packages, but that's it.  
Regarding modification of the kernel, since I'm using a standard Raspberry Pi linux distro that anyone can download, it's easy to check if I've modified anything, even the kernel.  To verify the integrity of a system file, download the distro from a 3rd party website which I have no control over.  Then, you can simply take the hash of any system files and compare it to the hash of the same system files on Piper.

I dunno, new address every hour isn't realistic but new address every day or every week is.  Local libraries charge like $0.05 for a print.  
Plus they could have instant sweep set up with a service like Coinbase, so the address's final balance is always 0 anyway.  Sure, you could see how much has ever been sent there, but without looking through the actual transaction logs (a tedious process if there are many transactions) you can't tell when it was sent.

Stored properly means a cool dry place.  I'm in talks right now with the manufacturer of special coated paper that has a 20 year image life.  Think airline tickets.
Right now, the keys are generated by vanitygen.  I plan on adding individual, unique entropy to the /dev/random pool for each unit from random.org (which gets it's entropy from atmospheric noise).  Here's how vanitygen generates it's keys, from the thread about it on bitcointalk.org:

Your edit is correct, I'm using the hardware RNG on the Raspberry Pi.  I'm currently using vanitygen to do the actual generation of the keys which pulls from /dev/urandom not /dev/random.  But, I tested /dev/urandom with the 26 dieharder tests of randomness and it passed with flying colors.
/dev/urandom is seeded by the hardware RNG so that's why it works fine.  The source for vanitygen is also included on the unit so you can easily change it to use /dev/random if you're worried.  But like I said, I'm just using vanitygen which is widely regarded to be a secure way to generate keys even though it uses /dev/urandom.

Obviously since you run Linux this isn't usually an issue because the number of screencapping Linux trojans is small.  But I find it funny when people say "unplug from the internet while you generate the addresses!" like it will actually have some effect if their machine is infected.

My apologies.  I just want people to know that it's possible to encrypt a paper wallet, and that I've come up with something to make encrypting and printing a paper wallet easier.  I'll try to limit it to once per thread in the future, thanks for the tip.

This is why I recommend you encrypt your private keys.  
Or, you can try and securely store your Piper separate from it's power adaptor which would make this kind of attack more difficult.

Yes but not large amounts, only small.  My rule is only put so much that I wouldn't feel bad if I lost it, like when you grab some cash from your stash and put it in your pocket/wallet for a night out.  Never grab more than you can stand to lose that night!

Nice revisionist history there. 
What actually happened is the bitcoin community lashed out at you wanting $5000 for an app that would only take a few hours to write.  But GrainElevator, how do you know it could be written so fast and with so little effort?  Because I'm the guy who wrote the app for free in a few hours on a Friday night to show how trivial it is.  You can download it here: 


The community rejected the idea of you getting five thousand dollars to make a trivial iOS app, but the community did help.  I (a member of the community) wrote the frickin app and released it for free!  Your goal was accomplished by the community, you just didn't get any money for it.  The community saved $5000 as a result.  Sure, the community never helped **you**.  But that's because what you were asking for was unreasonable.  
Anyone reading this can verify my version of the story by reading the thread he posted: 
Here's the source code to the iOS app in case anyone wants to learn iOS development :)

So, for key generation to be secure, you must know that the computer you're using is totally secure.  
Suppose you unplug your internet from the wall, then generate a key with a local copy of bitaddress.org.  Then you save it to a flash drive, close bitaddress.org, eject the drive, and reconnect your internet.  It's impossible for someone to steal your keys, right?  Well, if your computer was infected with a screengrabber trojan for example, it will send a screenshot with your private key to a scammer who will see it and think "Ohh, a bitcoin address!  Jackpot!"
The only way to be sure is to use a Linux LiveCD or a separate secure computer that you never, ever connect to the internet.  In the past, people (like myself) have been buying netbooks and Raspberry Pi's (small barebones linux computer) to use as an offline wallet generator.  I bought a Raspberry Pi for just such this purpose, and then I realized that since it has a USB port I could just hook my own printer up to it and print paper wallets with it.  Since Piper is based on the Raspberry Pi, it retains this ability.  
By adding a small printer, Piper became a turn-key solution to the key generation and paper wallet printing problem.  You can totally build Piper yourself with a Raspberry Pi and various other parts, and I encourage people to do this.  But there is soldering involved and you need to know your way around a Linux commandline.  
The paper wallet method of storage is also really convenient if you use blockchain.org because they let you import private keys from a QR code using a webcam or cellphone camera.  So when you're ready to spend the paper wallet, you can just scan the code and the money is instantly in your blockchain.info wallet.  
I'm the guy behind Piper.  Great question by the way!  I really need to add this type of stuff to the website ( but my priority right now is finishing my order backlog for my Kickstarter backers.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:43:12
You can import a BIP0038 key directly into many wallet programs and the program will prompt you to enter the password to decrypt it.  
I've personally tested this on blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-08-05 15:06:31
Unless you encrypt the private key before you print it.  Then you need "something you have" and "something you know" to access the funds.  Having physical access merely grants the attacker "something you have" but not the password to decrypt the private key which is the "something you know"

Indeed, this would fix it.  Or alternatively, you could just encrypt the private key with a password and not worry about having to obscure it visually.

iOS developer here.
Google uses Apple's built in keychain class to store your Authenticator private key. This is a recommended best practice because all data in your iOS keychain is encrypted and deemed to be secure. Your keychain is a sqlite database that is not stored in the application bundle, instead it is stored in a globally accessible location on the filesystem. Meaning, all apps use the same keychain database, and deleting an app doesn't delete the data from the keychain database.
TL;DR; The iOS keychain allows apps to store data across uninstalls. Authenticator uses it.

So, I did some looking, and the System-on-a-Chip I'm using (Broadcom BCM2835) actually does have a hardware RNG in it.  Some quick googling shows that driver support was added for it to the Linux kernel in feb/march of this year.  Here's some info (from here: 






So I need to recompile vanitygen to use /dev/random instead of /dev/urandom, and make sure I've got the driver for the hardware RNG included.  I will also do some more research into how exactly the hardware RNG in the SoC works.

A che-ck?  What's that?  Some way to transfer bitcoins over the sneakernet?
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:55:18
His advice is not "don't use bitcoin".  His advice is "don't use bitcoin if your afraid of losing money in it".  This is something that gavin himself has repeated many times. Gavin says over and over "don't put more money in BTC then you can stand to lose".  Bitcoin is very much experimental and still in beta. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:01:25
The site in the screenshot is coinbase.com, and it says all over the site that transfers take 4 or more days unless you have a level 2 account.  It also says that when you press the big blue button in the picture.  So the OP just has problems with reading comprehension I guess.
@_date: 2013-10-09 19:24:24
Right, and if the post ended there, you'd be right, but he then goes on to clarify it as


And remember, context is important.  Even if he didn't clarify it with his final sentence, his point is still the same _in this context_.  I really hate to take the time to do this, but I'll go ahead and walk you through this:
* The OP said he's "worried about the technical difficulties section of the wikipedia entry"
* That section of the wikipedia article is all about people losing the money they stored in bitcoin
* It's widely known in the community that Gavin (the lead developer of Bitcoin) has said "don't put money into bitcoin if you can't afford to lose it"
* Since the OP is worried about the technical difficulties section of wikipedia, and that's all about losing money in bitcoin, the OP is worried about losing money in bitcoin.
* Therefore, since the OP is afraid of losing money, he should not use bitcoin 
This is why the phrase


makes perfect sense _in this context_ to mean

Thanks for the praise!
And what you said about thermal paper is absolutely true.  Luckily Piper can also backup the keys to a flash drive as well if you choose, or you can use your own USB printer (laser, inkjet, whatever) with Piper.  So you aren't stuck with the thermal paper as your only means of storing the keys.  
Here's some more info on how to properly store the thermal paper from the paper manufacturer for anyone who's interested:

Great question!  
Obviously, the image life was a huge concern for us. We've selected high quality thermal paper with a 7 year image life when stored properly (cool, dry, office filing type conditions). Here's some information from our paper manufacturer, the part you'll want to jump to is most likely "Image Life": 
Also, it's important to point out that Piper lets you back the keys up that you've printed in "remember" mode on a flash drive if you desire. It would be prudent to back them up to at least 2 flash drives stored in separate locations if you're storing any substantial amount of BTC.
And finally, paper wallets printed in "remember" mode are stored on the Piper device itself (this is required to enable the backup feature described above).
So don't worry, your keys are safe if you print in "remember" mode. If you're printing in "forget" mode, then make sure you know what you're getting into, and that your're aware your private key will only exist in paper form. "Forget" mode is great for giving a friend some BTC for a birthday present for example, stuff like that.

I'm the guy behind Piper.  To avoid a BFL type situation, I actually have bought a ton of parts up front to build Piper.  The only thing I'm still waiting on is the enclosures to be finished manufacturing.  
I actually have a BFL preorder from July 2012 (that I haven't received yet, arg), so I know how bad it feels to order something and then not have it arrive for a really long time.  That won't happen here.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:18:54
It really is a feature though, since it can be done without needing to hook up a display/mouse/keyboard.  I wrote code that listens for the USB insertion event and automatically copies the keystore to the device, then ejects the disk.  That's what makes it a "feature".  
I agree that the ability to copy data to a drive alone is not a feature.  But because I wrote code that enables this to happen without the need to hook up a monitor/tv/mouse/keyboard is what makes it a feature of Piper.

I definitely appreciate the feedback.  One of the things that's difficult developing something like this alone is a shortage of creative solutions like the one you just suggested.  
I had all kinds of overcomplicated ideas to solve this, like having people send me a public key which would be added to the device when I manufacture it and would automatically encrypt USB backups with that key.  Your solution is so much simpler, and so much easier for the end user.
I know what you mean though, it's tough sometimes to distance yourself from the project, step back, and say "regardless of what I think, this idea needs to be considered from a neutral point of view and evaluated on it's merits as a solution to the problem, not on how I personally feel about it"

Great question!  The Raspberry Pi has a thermal-noise based hardware RNG built in to the BCM2835 SoC.  I installed the kernel module that activates the hardware RNG, and then set up rngd to dump entropy from the RNG into /dev/random about every 15 seconds.  
Also, Piper comes with an offline copy of bitaddress.org which uses the mouse movements as entropy.  So you can still generate keys that way if you hook up a mouse and a display since Piper has a USB port and an HDMI port.

I like this design, a lot.  You put thought into readability and the design really flows.  The only thing I would change is labeling the public/private keys.  I know it's obvious to us that a key beginning with 5 is private and 1 is public, but most people don't know that.

This is a great response, thank you!  I do have the hardware RNG enabled via the kernel module and I added it to /etc/modules so that it will always be loaded on boot.
So how's this for some rngd parameters?  (I've added these flags to the daemon script in /etc/init.d so that they will be used on startup)
    /usr/sbin/rngd -r /dev/hwrng -Q low -t 20
What else should I add?  I'm not sure which flag will fully handle number 4 from your list.  I did -t 20 so that rngd will add entropy to /dev/random every 20 seconds instead of every 60 seconds, which is similar to your number 4.  Here's the manpage for rngd.

Hi, I'm the guy who makes Piper.  First of all, thank you for your interest!
Right now, we're using paper with a 10 year image life if stored in office filing conditions, meaning a cool dry place.  Piper also gives you the ability to back your keys up to a flash drive, and the ability to use your own USB printer.  
Here's a link to storage information from the paper manufacturer:

I'm happy to answer any other questions you might have.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:30:05
I definitely agree that encrypting the keys with GPG and backing everything up in a lot of different places is one of the best ways to do it.  Total protection from disaster as long as you keep a copy of the private key and symmetric passphrase somewhere offsite as well.  Also solves the issue of needing to create and remember a strong passphrase, which could easily be forgotten.
And I agree that it's totally fun to implement the different approaches and see how they work and stuff.

To add to this, it's not gambling if you're basing your investment on sound principles that you think have the potential to be useful to a large number of people.  
Putting $1000 on black on a roulette wheel is gambling.  Putting $1000 into a technology that you think has the ability to change the world is investing.  
Bitcoin provides a very real utility: the ability to (almost) instantly transfer money to anyone in the world for an extremely tiny fee.  You try sending $50,000 to your wife abroad through traditional means and tell me how it goes.  You'll have to physically go to the bank, fill out a ton of paperwork, and you'll be lucky if the money arrives in a week.  It will likely take much longer to arrive.  I can do the same thing from my computer with bitcoin in like 3 clicks and it will be totally confirmed in about an hour.

Hi, I'm the guy behind Piper.  Obviously, the image life was a huge concern for us.  We've selected high quality thermal paper with a 7 year image life when stored properly (cool, dry, office filing type conditions).  Here's some information from our paper manufacturer, the part you'll want to jump to is most likely "Image Life": 
Also, it's important to point out that Piper lets you back the keys up that you've printed in "remember" mode on a flash drive if you desire.  It would be prudent to back them up to at least 2 flash drives stored in separate locations if you're storing any substantial amount of BTC.
And finally, paper wallets printed in "remember" mode are stored on the Piper device itself (this is required to enable the backup feature described above).
So don't worry, your keys are safe if you print in "remember" mode.  If you're printing in "forget" mode, then make sure you know what you're getting into, and that your're aware your private key will only exist in paper form.  "Forget" mode is great for giving a friend some BTC for a birthday present for example, stuff like that.

Hah nice!  Thanks for the tip, I'll make sure there's a disclaimer just in case.
@_date: 2013-08-28 12:28:50
That google groups thread is from May of 2012.  
The truth is that Google hasn't said anything recently about bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-30 21:06:39


I absolutely agree.


I know bank transfers in the US do take at least 2 days but I'm not sure if that's the reason for doing it.

So it uses bitaddress.org when you use the GUI, but if you don't plug in a TV/Monitor and just press the button to print, it uses vanitygen which I believe is seeded from /dev/random which is known to be cryptographically secure.  
I plan on adding unique entropy to /dev/random from random.org to each individual unit, so that no two units are identical software wise.  Random.org gets it's entropy from atmospheric noise.
The bitaddress.org script uses a number of different things including mouse movement for the random seed, but bitaddress.org is only used as part of the GUI when you hook up a keyboard/mouse/monitor
From the bitcointalk.org thread on vanitygen:

Most people don't keep their all coins at a single address.

It doesn't matter.  BFL will be able to produce a tracking number with a "delivered" status.  This PROVES that the item was delivered.  And as the poster above said, your credit card company will say "talk to the postal service, the product was delivered, there's nothing we can do."

Piper also has the ability to back your keys up to a USB flash drive, so if you're worried about losing your paper copies of your keys you can just back them up.
In addition, Piper has the ability to print using your own USB printer.  So if you have a nice inkjet or laser printer, you can easily print to regular copy paper. 
It is good practice to keep your keys in multiple places anyway, incase of fire or other disaster.  Piper makes this really easy.
@_date: 2013-05-07 15:01:28
The paper we're using right now has an image life of 3 years if stored in a cool, dry place.  We're working on getting longer life paper though.
Piper also has a USB port so you can use your own printer if you wish.  
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:32:19
Absolutely.  It's all python so you'll be able to check the source on the actual unit if you desire as well.
@_date: 2013-08-09 12:17:57
Absolutely.  Just change line 26 of this file (located at /home/pi/Printer/genkeys.py on Piper itself): 
from this: 
    process = Popen(["./vanitygen", "-s","/dev/random", "-q", "-t"," 1", "1"], stdout=PIPE)
to this:
    process = Popen(["./vanitygen", "-s","/dev/random", "-q", "-t"," 1", "1RR"], stdout=PIPE)
I don't know how much time it will add to the key generation process, but I know it's possible.  I'll try a few tests this weekend, because this could be a cool option to add to the settings of the Piper software.
Thanks for the great idea!
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:34:39
It's totally open :-D
So, no need to jailbreak or any crap like that.  Also the code is all python so the source is included with the unit, making it really easy to modify Piper to do whatever you want.

Yes.  After this all happened and Authenticator was working properly, I decided to add it to my 2nd phone (android) as a backup.  I went to the blockchain.info site and used the QR code, and lo-and-behold, the auth code on my android was identical to the one on my iOS device.  Meaning, I opened both authenticator apps and the exact same code was there.
So yes.

Hi, great question!
I'm the guy behind Piper.  This is something that I've thought about, and I want to include it as a software option.  Meaning, I want the user to be able to plug in a keyboard, mouse, and tv/monitor and then set a password to be used for encryption.  
I'm going to have them unencrypted by default, since some people will never plug in a keyboard, mouse, and tv/monitor, but I do want to offer encryption as an option.  
Thanks for your question!

A few things
1. You should never store thermal paper in any kind of heat.  Paper wallets printed by Piper should be stored in office filing conditions in a cool, dry place.  The link in my post above explains the proper way to store thermal paper.
2. Receipts are printed on the cheapest thermal paper that can be purchased, which has a very short image life.  We use high grade thermal paper designed to last 10 years.
3. Piper has a USB port and can print to your existing USB Inkjet/Laser printer.  So if the thermal paper is a huge concern, just print on regular paper.

So um, funny story, I never loaded any BTC onto that paper wallet.  Someone else did, whoever owns this address:

Great question!  We're taking bitcoin orders on our site   We sell all the same stuff as the kickstarter levels, except we don't sell flash drives which are included with some of the higher levels on kickstarter.  
So, the highest level on kickstarter is a Piper Model B with 5 rolls of paper and a flash drive.  You can just go to our site, and put a Piper Model B and then 4 extra rolls of paper into your shopping cart.  The only thing you'll be missing out on compared to the kickstarter reward is a flash drive.
Thanks for your interest!

blockchain is a lot more secure since they only keep encrypted wallets on their site and decrypt them client side.

The paper I've purchased (3 year life) is special long-life thermal paper.  The manufacturer directly told me the image will last at least 3 years if stored properly.

Thanks man, I submitted a listing
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:59:01
Actually, that's not true.  It's a not necessarily a one-person to many-addresses relationship either because multiple people can share a single address as well.  Since it's therefore a many-to-many relationship, the "bitcoin distribution by address" chart cannot help you determine the amount of people who hold more or less bitcoin than yourself.

Just an FYI: that kit only works with Arduino, the Raspberry Pi one is here: 
The Piper software is directly compatible with that kit, so if you have soldering skills and aren't afraid of a linux command line, you can essentially build your own Piper from that kit.  
Also something to note is that the Adafruit enclosure has no cutouts for the ports, so don't plan to hook up a display/mouse/keyboard.  And of course it doesn't have the remember/forget switch as well.

The protocol itself is still experimental and in beta though.  So regardless of whether or not this is "more than an experiment" doesn't change the fact that the protocol is in beta and very much experimental itself.

iOS developer here.
Google uses Apple's built in keychain class to store your Authenticator private key.  This is a recommended best practice because all data in your iOS keychain is encrypted and deemed to be secure.  Your keychain is a sqlite database that is not stored in the application bundle, instead it is stored in a globally accessible location on the filesystem.  Meaning, all apps use the same keychain database, and deleting an app doesn't delete the data from the keychain database.  
TL;DR; The iOS keychain allows apps to store data across uninstalls.  Authenticator uses it.

Thank you!

I agree that 3 years isn't a long time.  That's why I'm currently in talks with the manufacturer of a special coated paper that has a 20 year image life.  Think airline tickets.

Unless all knowledge of the BIP0038 algorithm is lost, it doesn't matter what closes.  Someone could always create a way to decrypt them by following that algorithm.
