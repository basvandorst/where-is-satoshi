I've been using credit and debit cards for 8 years and have never had that problem. Maybe you have poor credit.

Well, hopefully he learned his lesson and won't be doing business with them again. Caveat emptor or whatever.
@_date: 2014-12-09 07:56:06
I've only seen your posting for two days, but it seems like you have a gambling problem and a persecution complex. Seek help!
@_date: 2014-04-25 04:53:34
but this is good news right

"Dissenting opinions must be silenced."
welcome to @_date: 2014-04-20 20:39:43
Wow what an easy procedure to make sure your money's safe. Being your own bank sounds like a blast.
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:59:32
It contains a single transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:32:04
They are literally like, the basics. You can't ignore that.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:18:39
"Also let's label the dissenters as 'trolls' so we can quickly dismiss their opinions, making the echo chamber more efficient!"
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:27:50
Yeah, don't count me, I'm just here for the schadenfreude.

That was the dumbest shit I've seen in a long time. I guess it's better than another one of his videos where he talks into the camera like he's got a gun pointed at his head, but man, that was dumb.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:44:04
May your investing panache be as savvy as your arguments herein.
Shouldn't be too hard to achieve, considering, y'know, Bitcoin and all :P
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:57:58
how is the homeless swamp experiment going, anyhow?
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:03:36
but renting out your hard drive space to some stranger over the internet for an unregulated currency oh my god do I have to go into how unfeasible this is
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:22:23
Ah, yes, sending a stranger internet money with no chargebacks and accepting payment from them, if it comes at all, with a reversal mechanism. Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:42:04
have you heard of cloud storage
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:44:33
I don't see why they don't just reverse the transaction. You'd think in a case like this, it's obvious that the transfer was fraudulent, the real owner/operator has come forward, and the money should go back to its rightful owners.
What the fuck do you mean, "no chargebacks"?
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:30:36


@_date: 2014-04-20 20:54:58
I'd heard the same thing, and wasn't really surprised when I actually read the article. It seems to be a lose-lose for Bitcoin; whatever meager attention it gets for being accepted somewhere, there are that many more bitcoins going straight to the market since the vast majority of businesses "accepting bitcoin" actually mean "give your bitcoins to Bitpay so we can receive actual money".
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:04:07
There's even more you can't do with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:03:59
Refer to this chart:

I'm gonna go with the lame imagination. Dumbass.

It was his decision to trust Mt. Gox. In the free market you're fully responsible for your own actions, and it's unfortunate that this happened but that's the price of no regulation. Now everyone knows not to trust Mt. Gox so they probably won't be seeing any more business.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:41:43
I feel bad for you, but how fucking dense are you? You can't possibly have missed the repeated advice not to risk more than you can afford to lose. Jesus.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:12:14
It hasn't been profitable for a long, long time. With everyone continually adding more and more power to the network, it's like a game of the prisoner's dilemma where everyone's mashing the "betray" button over and over again. The work of the network could be done by a single NES, but greed powers the continual expansion of the network.
I do understand that some amount is necessary to secure against a 51% attack, but it's just ridiculous at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:44:02
"Like gold, but for internet libertarians!"
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:59:41
sort of like a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:31:29
Well, a surprising amount ~~beg~~ ask politely and get 50% back.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:39:29
It seems like it can be fleeced from users pretty easily, though.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:11:43
Yeah I go around proselytizing my investment to random people too.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:48:27
Just tag him "Scammer" and move on. Free market.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:30:33
He said, stoopingly.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:30:12
Well, then don't use them, or responsibly assume the risk if you do. Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin to avoid centralization anyway?
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:09:27
BUY BUY BUY ~~UP UP UP~~ DOWN DOWN DOWN
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:28:50
I don't get it. Bitcoin was less stable than the US dollar this year, last year, the year before that, and the year before that.
@_date: 2014-10-23 07:11:04
Wallet is pretty easy to get set up with and use; linked my bank account and two cards, and now any time I owe a friend money or vice versa for beer or something, I can send it to them through email on my phone. No fees, super simple.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:03:05
Exchanging your super high tech internet money in person in some Wal-mart parking lot and then getting robbed is the way of the future, after all.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:10:12
I believe that adds up to about 300 million people with caps, some of them extremely low. Want to get your head out of your ass and acknowledge the problem?
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:45:07
This anecdotal evidence surely proves your point, yes sir. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:26:56
Oh, I thought every time he made a video he did it in a room where one of his loved ones was being held at gunpoint just off-camera.
@_date: 2016-03-27 21:17:21
They're just sorry for their Ross
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:30:55
I can't remember the last time an uninsured financial institution lost 5% of the world supply of dollars irreversibly, can you?
no chargebacks are a *feature*!
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:04:23
The end had me laughing, too!
@_date: 2016-11-05 08:51:51
This guy also got in serious trouble for sending explosives through USPS to an apartment building, endangering lives. He's a wack job. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:57:21
To those not in the know he shipped illegal fireworks through USPS under the guise of fertilizer and stored mass amounts of them in an apartment building. Asshole. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:27:18
You're correct 
@_date: 2015-09-03 11:31:02
That's a 200% increase! Moon! 
@_date: 2015-11-10 12:14:13
Your fault. Should've done your DD. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:13:28
Some people still defend him to this day, claiming that the people spreading "fud" about him is what caused him to flee with their bitcoins.
No, stupid. Your unending trust is what enabled him to make off with piles of coins.
@_date: 2013-03-01 04:49:44
Maybe they are referring to the competition's chips.
@_date: 2013-05-20 19:35:38
I'd say SS is as good a diagnosis as any. Refusing to accept that they made a mistake.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:54:58
Get out while the getting's somewhat good. Won't be long now till we hit 2011 crash prices, and who knows what that will trigger. 
Frankly, I'm surprised it's still as high as it is, but it's steadily dropping. I went to get dinner from my kitchen and came back to a further $2 decrease, and it's another $2 below that point as I type this and getting lower.
@_date: 2013-04-27 19:10:03
Here is a relevant article:
@_date: 2013-09-17 17:07:41
Would you really trust an escrow service to hold your bitcoins for the full year some people have been waiting on their BFL orders, given market volatility and the amount of services that usually fall through in some way or another?
