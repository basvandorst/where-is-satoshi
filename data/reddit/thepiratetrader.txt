No. I've read it's good to update it every 100 transactions, but it will sync when you bring it online as the coins aren't stored on the wallet, the balance is stored in the blockchain. You just use your wallet to send transactions to public ledger that is the blockchain. At least that's my basic understanding of it.

In general, think the easy conclusion to an observation is wrong when dealing with markets. It's a psychological game.  F I stick a large "buy wall" at a price, a bunch o peons will try to front run it and I can sell to them. Then I remove my buy wall, they get scared when it goes below the price I had the buy wall at, they sell in panic and I buy up their shares that I had sold to them at a lower price. 
This isn't conspiracy theories. It's just smart trading. Every industry uses slight of hand. The better someone is at it, the better they are at their job. Plays use slight of hand to distract the audiences attention so that they can make an elaborate reveal. Magicians use slight of hand in much the same way. 
In trading we use slight of hand to get speculators to take the other side of the trade that we ultimately want. 
TL;DR: That buy wall most likely indicates a large seller, not a buyer.

Exactly this.

I believe the obvious response is: "Why stop now? You still have .00374xxx BTC left!"

You definitely made your point clear, and it does chance the story a bit. 
Here's what is the likely scenario. It is someone who is already long, willing but doesn't really want to buy more bitcoins. So what they do is they throw up a large buy to give short term traders the illusion of confidence that there is big money supporting them just below the current price. 
But he won't actually fill the order. You have to think about it from his perspective. Why would he just show everyone that he wants to buy that many coins. It would make far more sense if you wanted to get a large position in bitcoins to hide your buying and buy in small chunks on the way down. Or, if you're, more nefarious, force the price down with manipulation. That's why a large buy wall or a large sell wall is almost always an illusion and they don't actually exist as actual buyers. 
I don't have experience trading bitcoins. I'm just pointing out how it works in the stock market and I assume that it works the exact same way only more so and with dirtier tricks in an unregulated market like bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:58:44
I'm assuming this is a scam becuase they are 50% off the open market price...

Yeah no kidding. I'm as skeptical about the next guy on bitcoin, but if that's the definition of a Ponzi scheme, I am worried about the European Union for more than just their ability to fix the credit situation.

And we are being rewarded by digital coins. 
You know, I think this is the best theory yet.

It's have to be insanely difficult. 
I'm always amazed how quickly the Internet (reddit) people are able to figure things out. My guess is as soon as the riddle is posted, it would be solved in a matter of hours. Not enough for publicity.
If on the other hand you did it with physical locations (like in the movie--only places people could go) I don't know that you'd really get the kind of participation you are looming for. 
It's a fun idea, though, but I see a select few of adventurers participating. More a fun competition than a publicity stunt.

Just keep an excel spreadsheet.

This might support your argument. 
See reference 12.

And this is why Bitcoin will fail. Because people are using it not for it's purpose, but to later turn back into USD. It is a Ponzi scheme and those who are left holding the bags are going to lose big time. 
Now you will respond, "But I'm not going to sell all my coins." Who cares. You profited in terms of USD which is what you really care about. 
Now, I'm not saying this is bad for you, or I'm against what you are doing. You took a risk and you got the reward. All I'm saying is that this investment looks more like a ponzi scheme than anything else. And it's a ponzi that will crash like a bubble.

See my response to OPs response just above. It answers your comment as well I believe. It's still highly unlikely a real buy order. It is still just an illusion of someone trying to egg buyers into the market. It he starts to get fills, he will likely cancel it.

Campbx being a small exchange doesn't really have a market of its own. People look to mtgox or their queues. So when mtgox gets erratic, campx follows suite. 
This is why in the real market, there is a national best bid best offer and all the exchanges simply display their best order on the book.

Since you believe in bitcoin, I will offer 3 bitcoins. This is better than $300,000 according to some believers. 
Offer only valid through Saturday. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:07:59
Ha thanks! Those are actually my first bitcoins. I accept them proudly.
I believe so. Really, I think you just need to know the private key, but backing up the file saves the private key.

I mean, I don't really see the benefit to paper trading bitcoin. If you really want to then excel is the way to do it. If you want to try out say trading just download a retail broker and trade commodity futures paper style.

The trouble is chargebacks. That's why most individuals won't be willing to do this with you.

The assumption is that as mining becomes more difficult the price relative to USD would increase because the miners are paying more for power and so the "value" of each bitcoin increases. 
However, speaking as someone who only has $0.93 worth of bitcoins and no real interest in trading/investing in a fast market, but years of experience investing in domestic equities, I will say that the easy trade rarely works out. This is the case with investing. Most people call it "buy the rumor, sell the news." The idea being that if everyone knows the difficulty is going up and that will drive the price up, then everyone buys in ahead of the event. If everyone has bought in ahead of the event, then there is no one left to buy after the event happens and the price corrects. 
So at this point I haven't really said anything, just that price is impossible to know with certainty. Bitcoin is fundamentally inclined to increase in value in normal circumstances. It's deflationary in nature and the more popular it becomes, the more popular mining becomes, the more popular mining becomes, te more difficult it becomes, the more difficult it becomes, the more "valuable" the bitcoins are to the miners, the more valuable the bitcoins  are to the miners the more goods or USD they will demand for their bitcoins. 
But there is a lot of hype in the current market and that worried me (but that has been true since $30 back in January). 
I like your idea of saving some of your coins, but continuing to cash out. 
The most important thing is that your thesis for what bitcoin is and what it can or cannot become lines up with your plan for how you plan to profit on them. 
Anyways, I rambled. I'm bored. Hopefully you found some of the thoughts useful.

Would the pizza guy even still have his wallet after 3 years? I would have thought those coins were lost. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:51:13
No, you're fine. I would just caution you that you refine your strategy. 
Spread trading is all well and good, until it goes against you. Know what you are going to so ahead of time so that you don't panic sell the bottom or panic buy the top. 
That's how most day traders end up losing. They do good, collect 10% moves here or there and then in one trade give up 50%. It seems easy at first, what you are doing, but I promise you, you will get burned at least once and likely more than once. 
Just make sure you are only ever risking what you are willing to lose.

Right. I totally understand that they're divisible and that's my point. We're not going to see the $100,000 price targets in relation to the USD while people hoard their coins and don't divide them among the masses. Once they are divided, and that single bitcoin is extremely valuable to everyone, then the purchasing power of the microbitcoins will increase.
As for your argument that even if I don't buy any bitcoins until the price is at 1,000,000 it doesn't cost me anything... it does if bitcoins are unstable and I don't know what my purchasing power will be or how it will change from the time I convert to the time of purchase.

As in you want to give someone your credit card info and they'll run in and give you bitcoins? 
You'd probably need to have a trust rating somewhere for a random person to do this for you. If you are wanting to sell stolen card information, the I can't help you.

Not sure if sarcastic or seriously thinks that way.
