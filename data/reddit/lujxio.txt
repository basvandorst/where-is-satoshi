because he incited hate against these groups. twist his words however you want to say they were not racist and sexist but he did incite hate towards these groups of people.

Here's the [source]( on registering muslims, if you google it you will find more news outlets reporting on it. I am not gonna argue with you about how the things he said definitely incited hate against hispanics and muslims b/c it's obvious we will not agree. And while true he can not control who endorses him, he does have control on what he says and there were many times when he could've denounced the support from the hate groups and he didn't. To me he is a worm and I don't think he's gonna do any good but hey agree to disagree

He did incite hate against those groups. Why do you think the KKK was supporting his candidacy? b/c they were incited. Dude cmon you can't be this dense. I don't support either candidate but you can't say he didn't incite hate against hispanic and muslims. He wants to make muslims register on a list, that sounds like some Hitler/Marvel Civil War kind of shit. But dude we don't even have to argue about it we can just sit back and watch what happens b/c he's the president now congrats.
