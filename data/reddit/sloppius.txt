Obviously not.  But read about all the bad stuff going on around Segwit2X.  To me anyways, scary times.

Just hold for like 2 months and it'll double.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:49:54
Of course its going to correct man, go play in some alts for a bit, maybe give it 2 days and it'll be at 4800 or so.

Tell them only put in what they are willing to lose. :P

It'll probably get cut in half again. And then double again.  It's a cycle.  Happened 2 months ago when BTC went down to 1800 from 2500 or whatever.  Honestly if you want to just relax, come back at Xmas time or something and see if it's doubled and if you want take your money out and spend it!  :D
Or put more money in when it dips.  I think BTC is going to go to 3200 or even 2800ish within a few weeks so you can try to put more money in then.

Getting to phase 2.  3 months after my mom buys her first bitcoin is when I sell everything.  I’ll let you guys know.

That’s the rumour 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:55:57
Lying how though?  What are some examples of their lies?  More curious than anything, not saying your wrong.
