u/PineappleFund , the world needs more people like you! In this world, we have something in the bank, our programmed though is to save it, either increase that amount or save it and hide it for a rainy day. 
You have spread your funds around so beautifully, changing so many lives. 
I wish I could know I would do the same. You're an inspiration to us all! 
(and i'm not just saying this so you'll wire me some btc!)

Totally get the sentiment. But if you bought BTC because you believe in the tech, did you ever spend it?
I see no point in 'HODL'ing other than to increase an investment's value. I don't hold USD, I spend it. I save, yes. But if you want to support BTC, shouldn't you use it? 
Really, Like the sentiment, completely agree. Just wondering. 
Edit: You seemed to address this above^

for people who see BTC as a currency (which it's meant to be) and want it to gain mass integration and replace everyday transactions, you're 100% right.
For people who are looking to profit off this before the dust settles and it becomes a practical currency (no crazy price fluctuations), like I and many others do, it makes sense to hold 
I'm 100% for it becoming a worldwide standard currency, it would and will be incredible. But when it's value doubles almost exponentially, i'm throwing gas on that fire and trying to dig myself out of poverty. I've already made 1/2 months salary, essentially out of thin air, in less than a months time. I'm stoked. I'm holding

WOW! This is awesome! I remember when they posted a week or two ago, someone recommended archive.org as a terrific thing to donate to! THANK YOU to the person who recommended, and **THANK YOU** to the Pineapple Fund!! 
As a lover of the internet, history, and especially music (specifically jam music), I am SO stoked that archive is getting some cash! Hell yeah!

It means something to people who put modest amounts of money in this currency, and are trying to be patient as they see it as a long term investment, which over the past year has proven as a very, very, very good one to make.
I put a chunk in at 9-10k$, and i'm sitting on it for a while, therefore i am holding until i feel it's an appropriate time to either: cash in on my investment, or cut and run before i lose my initial investment.
is everyone doing that? no. do what you want, i'm holding

i don't know much about crypto, and don't pretend to. But after thanksgiving, where people went home to their families and spread the word about bitcoin to their siblings and cousins and parents, etc.. it went up, along with exchange registrations.. like a lot of them, hundreds of thousands in 3 days
can't imagine Xmas will be any different, if not more significant. everyone can point to gains they had in the past month while showing how it's also being accepted by futures markets
i can't imagine it would just fall out of the sky. not any time soon. as soon as it drops people will pounce. How could it stay down or die in the next 1-6 months? i feel like the popularity/widespread craze is just getting starting
you're supposed to say 'HODL' here, right?

Shut up and give me money!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:26
really? i hope cause i bought a lil and it's still pending 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:06:52
sorry. you can use BTC tax to calculate your tax payment, it's free to use up to 20 trades worth of data, after that it's 30$
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:10:38
if you're in the states, i believe you still have to deal with it. you transferred USD into an asset that changed its initial worth, either up or down
BUT, if you just bought, the free 20 trades on BTC tax is probably enough to work out your tax ppwk

FOMO kept me from selling at $18k when i had already reached my goal

@_date: 2018-02-03 06:35:55

I love the guy, but I remember being really annoyed with him as a kid. I was always a Vegetta/Trunks guy
