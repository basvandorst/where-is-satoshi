You should embed or create informational videos/documentaries about Bitcoin. Users who watch an individual video till the end will receive free bitcoins.  Therefore, the website is informative and rewarding. You would have to add some code that tracks the watching time per user, but it would be a very cool domain.

In business, as [insert company name/specific contact here] know/knows, selling your product is essential, but, in doing so, it is vital that your company appeals to as many customers as it can. But how can it do this? By expanding payment options.
Companies now support many different payment services such as PayPal, eChecks, Credit Cards, etc. But what if you could support another? One that has extremely low transaction fees that not only expand your customer base and make it easier for them to buy your product but also help your company maximize profits? Now, is the time to consider Bitcoin. Some businesses seem to shy away from such an alternative, but that methodology is silly. By using payment services, such as BitPay, your business can accept bitcoins easily without worrying about converting it to dollars. Why? Because you can set BitPay up in such a way that every end of the business day, the amount in Bitcoin is converted to dollars automatically and deposited right into your corporate bank account. There is also NO transaction fees. When you sell your product for $12, you receive $12.
Whether you like the Bitcoin currency or not, you have to ask yourself: What is the downside to accepting it?
