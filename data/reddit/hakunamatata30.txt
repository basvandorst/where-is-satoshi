MinAddress uses the following concept making it permanent, secure and easy to verify:    
Full address to Min-Address Conversion:    




Min-Address to Full address Conversion:    




After every conversion you will get a verify link which can be used to verify your Min-Address/Full Address.
Example: Bitcoin Full Address: 17ykeSBpC8MrJr4GrizNUYz6DEnwQ598fQ    
             Min-Address: 3fa5b-17yk

**UPDATE IMPORTANT**    
It seems that many people confuse this with some kind of centralized system where I can later change the Min-Address. To clarify the information is completely based on blockchain and in no way the Min-Address can be modified. Also even if MinAddress.info is down, the user can easily convert the Min-Address to Full-Address. Suppose you have a min address 3fa5b-17yk which you want to convert to full address. Just use any online tool to convert the first part "3fa5b" to decimal from hex which will be 260699. Now go to block 260699 in any bitcoin blockchain like blockexplorer.com and search for "17yk" .You will get your complete address 17ykeSBpC8MrJr4GrizNUYz6DEnwQ598fQ.    
    
Minaddress.info just automates the conversion process[which can be done manually as shown above] and has no control over the final Min-address.

Well the website is also targetted on users who do not know anything about bitcoin and want to try the website out. They can use normal userid and password to register on website like any other website and once they interested they can get into bitcoin part.
