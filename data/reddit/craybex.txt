From what I'm reading, it appears that Litecoin and bitcoin share the same or very similar "formats" of the private keys and they could be compatible with each other. I'm not too sure about all this but take a read of [this post about LTC and BTC mix ups.](

Why is this?

Well yes in some sense, cyptos like bitcoin were intentionally design to cap off the supply at 21 million, and so supply would be scarce and hopefully "protect" it from inflation.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy and there aren't lots vendors which allow for payment in bitcoin. But hopefully in the future as more vendors support it and as the price stabilises, we'll see it be used more in the sense of a traditional fiat currency.

Interesting as one could argue that bitcoins takes a lot of time, electricity, and computer power to create. And is essentially back by the laws of cryptography. Hence at least has more value than a piece of paper fiat ;) !

Because they have large pools they are more likely to get the reward which is shared amongst the pool. If I were a miner, I would be financially incentivised to join their pool because they are the most likely to get a reward. I guess perhaps some miners would think about decentralisation etc, but most just want to make as much return as possible I guess.

If you go under tools, preferences fees tab and enable “edit fees manually” you should be able to set the fee yourself. Currently 11-20sat/byte is being confirmed in 50-800minutes according to [this site.]( and that should result in quite a low transaction fee bearing in mind it might take long to confirm. 
Another option perhaps to use your seed from electrum and restore this in your ledger. But in my view it might be best to start fresh with a new seed which hasn’t been exposed to a computer connect to the internet, so it think it might be best just to do a low cost transaction.

If you don’t mind waiting for ~1day or so for your transaction to confirm, you could still send your coins to your ledger with a low fee which should not exceed a couple of dollars.

Consider that you can draw some parallels between gold and bitcoin, gold is a store of value and also considered a investment but gold can also be thought of a currency in some sense. Likewise with bitcoin it could be considered like gold, a store of value and a investment and hence why people but it and hodl it. With the idea to to store value, which unlike fiat we would hope isn't effected by inflation.
