What country is this? I see this type of stuff in US every day with banks, mobile provides, internet and cable provides. If you are not keeping a close eye on your bills and ever changing (often without notificaton) contracts you are very likely to be screwed.

The ball will start rolling eventually. Banks also have "fuck ... we are missing the train" thing. From there it's exponential.
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:46:43
once the price start dropping these type of post start appearing on ... go away with your FUD man
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:00:08
I recall similar stuff happened before gox news broke up. Two huge walls were happily eaten.

Each time you buy something with CC or DC you pay 2.5% transaction fee. Of course that fee is directly payed by the merchant but obviously you are the one who is ultimately paying.
This raises a good point. Bitcoin network should allow for the payment of the transaction fee by the receiving party and also a shared transaction fee. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:18:42
You are not alone.
Let's for once act as a comunity and crash those selfish sell walls. I am amazed how come that there are whales who don't give a fuck for bitcoin but only for their own profits. For them low price is never low enough. shame, shame, shame ...
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:28:41
old story with no new info.  It appeared 1 day ago in WSJ.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:35:07


It does matter because everything they ban is valuable.
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:51:54
What announcement are we talking about, btw?
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:40:10
not really, this came 1 hour ago, the price started falling long before. Probably IRS.
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:37:16
How do you take your dollars "to spend anywhere in the world"? Fill in your pockets with kilos of cash and jump into the plane to Hawaii? With BTC this is pretty strighforward. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:07:52
Chinese government buys cheap coins man, they will need FUD for later.
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:45:52
people are already getting in, they realised that &lt; 400 will probably not happen. Have you seen the orderbooks? Everyone wants cheap coins. so dude, go ahead and buy.

Warren Buffet is fearfull about bitcoin ... so he was about internet 20 years ago.
@_date: 2014-04-10 06:56:22
yeh... if whales won't stop this huge volatility on every leaf fall the bitcoin future is bleak 
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:43:13
where do you get the stats, that's interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:34:25
what news are you following? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:36:44
oh shit... respect man. Thanks for not dumping! 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:08:39
Could not be so much with SEPA. First of all SEPA is shared, second the fee is very small or even 0. I have never noticed any extracharge for sending person to person. So it wasn't SEPA for sure. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:49:08
Agreed, "crypto" is scarry. Use "virtual" instead.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:56:46
yeh... it is getting more and more official, looks like... :(

That is not *the* link. This one is the caused of chaos: 
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:32:58
any western backups?
@_date: 2014-04-17 04:31:33
thanks. The pdf linked in the article is actually a good find.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:06:10
How about transfering between two personal accounts at different banks? In different countries? Still figuring up what apples-to-apples mean?
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:53:56
The number of transactions is not low as compared to other blocks during the day.  Other pool's blocks consistently contain fewer than 200 transactions. So not an issue.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:36:58
Yes. Those guys suck with their announsment strategy. But fuck it ... I am buying more BTC asap. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 07:12:12
Did they post it on their website? 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:26:26
Well. I was doing it all the way along. Doubled my BTC holding in a month. 
If more people will do so, and don't shake their hands and sell, more stable the price will be. Good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:27:45
Or you can think the other way arround. They put the walls to push innocent folks down over their bids. When announcement came the walls were removed. With chenese this happens almost constantly.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:43:21
chinese are buying like crazy now, so it was fake 
@_date: 2014-04-25 04:35:25
What exactly does it say?
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:01:03
at this moment of time bitcoin is 10% inflationary. Deflation will come in 100 years from now. Let's talk then.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:00:10
Population doesn't translate into number of adopters nor it is indicative of the development of the technology. 
81% of bitcoin related investment is in North America, 70% in US. 51% of total world's bitcoin investment is in Silicon Valley alone. You still think US doesn't matter?
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:14:13
china broke 3k ... uhu!!!
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:02:27
Indeed. Since when is this feature there? This is kinda a big deal.
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:51:21
I understand how B receives bitcoins from S, but how on earth S receives 1000$ from B?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:33:53
Time to cooperate folks... really! Hold everyone! Don't let depression ruin it all.

11 april news ... they changed their minds since.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:28:47
nice ... but do they also have zero fee banging?
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:46:45
clear ... through bank transfer ...
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:52:38
don't worry man. The news was long along for a week. Hold for 1-2 more days. If you have more money, buy now. Be greedy when everyone else is fearful!
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:26:14
it was a nice experiment ... pitty if it goes away like this
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:53:32
Year inflation stats would be good. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:36:45
WTF does this mean, why do they use weibo, cannot they post on their site?


It seems that they didn't receive any notice for 4.15.
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:22:25
10am is already 20 minutes ago. So it is already running.

shit.. this time it looks more serious than previous fuds. It's kinda open statement. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:08:18
Well said man. Let's see if the mind can control trembling knees. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:26:11
why would you need so many? 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:35:18
It's rather 21milion BTC question.
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:12:42
Never sodl, only hodl!
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:36:19
And western exchanges reacted but chinese not. LOL
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:52:38
you mean fake like in "fabricated" or fake like in not the true version fo what happened?
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:16:56
You have contracts with third parties (shops, individuals etc) which run the soft ATMs. Those parties can transfer fiat into Bobby Li's account for example. So they sell BTC, take money from the buyer and transfer to Bobby. The buyer gets his BTC. Something of that kind.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:29:52
I thought people are selling too much ...
@_date: 2014-04-29 10:04:53
Great idea. This is what Satoshi should do with his coins, distribute them to students. Airdrop for the sake of adoption.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:27:17
daytraders with thousands of transactions per day should do the same:)
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:04:00


It looks like the ball started rolling in europe, and it will be rolling faster than in US. Good luck everyone!
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:14:15
there have been over a milion accounts on coinbase alone in january 
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:53:21


Are you nuts? How exactly 112 mil of fake dollars poored into BTC make the price legitmate?  
@_date: 2014-04-17 23:01:09
So that the emphasis is on a community not on a creator. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 08:03:34
you are not the first genius around. 1 year ago during the crash posts like
yours were emerging every other day
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:28:04
If you are a chinese and you have the last chance to get into the bitcoin market, what will you do? 
Personally, I would put half of all my CNY into the exchange. Huobi reported that there were no decrease of deposits following the news. That means something. Chinese are still jumpting in to buy cheap coins. 
The 30% drop as of the last week means that the news is almost, if not entirely, priced in.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:23:15
 The minority idea is the idea of the "smartest in the room". 
And you are missing the main point. Whatever is tied to US dollar *is* US dollar. Amazon coin is doomed to be a failure just as google wallet, apple wallet, facebook credit, ebay coins and all other shit. People will be using different coin/wallet for separate sites? That's clearly not what the general public wants.
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:13:02
Yes, and another 5 hits to BTC-e on the same page for me.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:15:26
You forgot the Microsoft, the old cow. She is also in the race.
I am horified on thoughts of bitcoin wallet integrated with Windows.
@_date: 2014-04-15 06:40:58
Not really. If Bobby has an account in US you just send to that account, and Bobby probably has one. But I think it's intended for Chinese mostly. So that they can withdrow their BTC without banks.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:56:29
Automated translation. I don't quite see where it says it has the same status as foreighn curencies.
Income from transactions with Bitcoin declared and taxed
April 2, 2014
Personal income from the sale or exchange of virtual currency Bitcoin declared the annual tax return on their tax is due on the total annual tax base (10%). 
According to the Revenue Agency for the purposes of tax treatment, income from the sale of Bitcoin currency is treated as income from sale of financial assets. Taxable income and the tax base in this case is the sum of the gains realized during the year specified for each transaction, less the amount of losses realized during the year designated for each specific transaction. Realized gain or loss is determined by the selling price is reduced by the cost of the financial asset.
Income from transactions with Bitcoin declared in Table 5 of Appendix № 5 of the annual tax return . The law does not provide tax forms to apply special documents proving the yield.
The deadline for submission of annual statements of income taxation of individuals, acquired in 2013, expires on April 30. In the same period must be paid and payable tax amount. Model declaration barcode NRA clients can download from the section "Documents for individuals"
Annual tax return may be filed by mail or on-site in some post offices where you will be issued a number. The declaration may be filed in person at the office of the NRA, and electronically signed with a digital signature.
More information for the declaration and payment of taxes and insurance is the NRA website. Telephone consultations are made on the price of a local call in the call center revenue agency. The number is 0700 18 700.

where is this news? when did it come? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:17:32
You wait for new ban on 14th? My opinion is that you should better hurry up and buy now till it's weekend. it might be late on Monday. But again, it's just my opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:57:38
This hight value clients theory is not very plausible IMO. 
Who the fuck would like to invest 112 milion in bitcoin at that time? Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF and second market don't account for that much even in current prices.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:02:53
I guess they are playing on the safe side for now and will change the legislation pretty soon, like UK did. Otherwise the law deafeats the core idea of the bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:54:29
Ok, so that opens an infinite number of options to put/get money into the exchange as long as there are third parties willing to sell BTC. Briliant idea.
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:55:19
This is a tocken tied to us dollar. It's some bulshit gift coin not a "real" VC coin.

@_date: 2014-05-03 06:33:38
"significant bug exists in the protocol" and "significant bug exists in the

Inflation is defined based on the money in the circulation and has nothing to do with new users or number of transactions. Some coins are lost every year, this is why the number is somewhat lower.
