"The point of Bitcoin" has been a lot of things to a lot of people over the years, but to me it has no point anymore. It's served it's purpose - it sparked a ton of cool projects backed by smart people, companies and corporations that solve actual problems, have actual use cases and will maybe even amount to something. Bitcoin never really had any intrinsic value and it probably never will. Bitcoin is a piece of software. 1st gen software. We're at 3rd gen variations now, being implemented into products, workflows, actual uses, most of which will start rolling out early in 2018. 
Even Enjin Coin has more utility and market sense than Bitcoin. It's funny 'cause it's true.
I have 0 BTC left in my porfolio after hodling for years. It's useless to me. When I transact value I use other coins anyway, and I've done so for a long time now, and I don't mind it at all. I feel comfortable doing that.
The point of Bitcoin, above all else, should be to do that, right - transact? If I'm feeling increasingly comfortable using, for example, ETH, LTC, XRB or any other coin to transact - what is the point of Bitcoin exactly?
And I don't care about BCH's solution, either. They're both dinosaurs in my eyes. :/
EDIT: For context, I work in a brokerage company / exchange office and I help people to buy BTC on a daily basis (we have fiat/BTC pairs, like other exchange offices have fiat/fiat pairs, because why not). I'm also a developer, I tried out as a miner for a while, I run multiple nodes for multiple coins just for fun, etc. So I've been around Bitcoin for years now and... it just didn't age well. My personal opinion.

I hope you'll find the following a constructive critique...
* your QR codes are unnecessarily large, any barcode scanner can easily scan a code a tenth of the size... this opens up a lot of usable breathing space
* the distance between the QR codes is disproportional to the outside margins
* the text addresses do not correspond to the labels ("public address" is in the same row as the BIP38 key, and vice versa)
* the text addresses could be better formatted for human readability instead of being in a wall of text
I'm **not** a designer, but I made a [very quick mock-up]( of how I'd go about doing something like this... This example isn't very precise and was in essence eyeballed, but I hope it gets across the general idea. The colored guides should be self explanatory in terms of white space usage to create symmetry.
A professional designer could easily replicate such an example with more precision and much better results.

So what? If I owned PayPal, I'd start looking at how to transition into a new paradigm before BitPay eats up the floor I'm standing on. I wouldn't be surprised if PayPal introduced bitcoin support soon. That's just another payment method on top of numerous others already covered in the PayPal ecosystem. Millions of sites already use PayPal and could accept bitcoin literally by doing nothing (or at most - ticking another checkbox in the PayPal settings), instead of integrating BitPay (which is easy, but still more work than doing nothing).

I, personally, at this point in time, as a hoarder, would buy the bread in BTC and then immediately buy back that BTC in Fiat on an exchange + 10-15% more as savings. Keeping my BTC ballance the same or growing, while spending BTC daily.

Tell him that even though at first he won't have huge BTC incomes, this will get him some publicity and people will ask around. 
Tell him you can help him get listed in Bitcoin merchant indexes and catalogues, mentioned on reddit, etc.
Tell him that the earlier he gets onto the train, the bigger the publicity impact will be (because when everyone starts accepting it, it won't be news anymore).
If he decides to do it, tell him he should print out cheat sheets for his employees, as they should all be educated in the basics of bitcoin to answer customer questions.

@_date: 2013-12-14 23:06:21
Think of a bitcoin wallet as a storage unit, a safety deposit box. On the outside of the box you have your **public address** (the one you see on your screen when you fire up Mycelium). This address is given to others so they can send bitcoin into the box. You gave it to the bitcointip bot, for example, so that you could withdraw Bitcoin from the reddit box into your Mycelium box.
In order to later spend money from that box, you need the key to unlock it. This is called the **private key**, and it was created by Mycelium at the same time the public address was generated. This private key is stored inside the Mycelium app on your phone. You don't see it, but Mycelium uses it automatically to unlock the box and sign your outgoing transactions. *(In case you're wondering, the bitcointip bot has a private key for your reddit wallet, and by issuing the withdraw command you asked the bot to sign that transaction for you.)*
Obviously, the private key is very important. If you lose your phone, you lose that key, and it doesn't matter that you know the address of your box - you can't open it. That's where the backup comes in. 
Mycelium backs up the private key from the phone into a PDF, and while doing so it encrypts it with a password so other people can't just intercept it on your e-mail account or in Dropbox or wherever you sent it out from Mycelium. You can print out this PDF and store it at home in a safe place. Store the password somewhere else for extra security, or write the password down on the same piece of paper if you're not that paranoid (actually, this is quite enough in my opinion).
That way, if you lose your phone, you can get another Android device, install Mycelium on it and import the private key from your paper backup into the new device. Mycelium will ask you for the corresponding password to decrypt the key and complete this process. Once you're done, this gives you access to your bitcoin on a different device.
To recap:
* A wallet is a pair of keys... it is comprised of a public address/key and a private address/key.
* The private key is used to unlock the public address and spend the funds there... It's in your phone and can be lost with the phone
* Back up the private key on paper so that you can import it into another phone and access the funds there, should you lose the original phone 
However, please don't store large amounts of BTC on the phone. Use Mycelium only for small amounts you can afford to lose or have stolen. Keep the rest in cold storage.
I'm happy to explain cold storage in a different comment upon your request. :)

This is showing potential and could be something more like a regular BTC debit card accepted anywhere: 
The site is not very descriptive, but it's basically like [this competitor (watch the video)]( with added Bitcoin support. You fund the card with BTC, they convert it to fiat, you spend it using the card at any POS or ATM.

I got to stay out all night without reporting in, and travel anywhere alone, during entire high school.

Have an upvote, because you don't deserve a downvote. Reddiquette is an unknown word in this sub.
With that said... you're looking at bitcoin through a single perspective - financial gain through speculation. Those panic sellers are like you, they see nothing but a chart. 
However, there are many of us who look at bitcoin as a software product, a protocol, an open source endeavor, a useful tool for international trade, etc. You won't believe how many people I know (anecdotal evidence, but still) that are banging their heads on the table over the last few weeks, desperate that they didn't buy or mine BTC once they heard about it for the first time. Because back then they believed in the system, but thought it was a dream that could never happen. Now they see their dream has a shot of actually coming true, that there's a growing ecosystem forming around all this speculation, and are looking eagerly to get back in to preserve this ecosystem.
I'm invested with a small amount of high-priced BTC. But if the price drops, I'm buying as much as I can afford, and I'm buying hard. And there's a whole bunch of us lined up for the take, trust me.

In that case you can use your prediction formula to extrapolate the possible number of users based on current value:
    x * 100 / 21*10^6 = 800 USD
    x = 800 * 21*10^6 / 100 = 8 * 21*10^6
    x ~ 160 million
But given you're obviously wrong about the value estimate (more like ~~10.000$~~5.000$ on average because of some really wealthy people inside the economy who are paying tickets to space and whatnot), and we need to think about the number of coins currently in circulation being smaller by a factor of 2, that would make the user estimate around 1.9 million.
That sounds pretty much right to me.

I'd like to have a go, if I may? I'm not an economist, though, so bare with me, I'm just in it for the conversation, to share my views and have them corrected if need be. You be the judge, I'm willing to learn.


The value of a Fiat currency, as I understand it (and this is very simplified), is backed by the trust in the country of issue, its economic situation, its credit rating and the amount of cash the local central regulatory bank pumps in and out of the system to level out the inevitable market disturbances. The latter is key, because single markets and single countries are affected by so many different geopolitical variables, that regulatory dampers are necessary in order to alleviate spillback into other markets. Right?
But, when you add all of this up, it's in essence still a trust-based value - the more people use a certain currency, the bigger its market cap, the perceived stability is higher and market fluctuations, acts of god and other events are less likely to erode trust massively in a short timespan (i.e. crash the value). Am I right so far?
In this regard, you're completely right. Bitcoin is defenseless this early on, because its market cap is watered down among many people worldwide who aren't in a strong enough network to compete with a single major market. Yet. It's already stronger in this regard than the currencies of many smaller countries, though. However, more and more merchants worldwide accept bitcoin as a payment method, and soon (we hope, that's the goal) it will start to behave as a global *currency* backed not by the strength of any specific country, but almost exclusively by the willingness of people to exchange it for goods and services *globally*. If a good percentage of the world uses this currency for trading, local geopolitics are unlikely to affect the global picture (unlike with local Fiat). Isn't this a logical assumption? If it is, in what way would a central *global* regulator be of any use? Local market crashes will remain local, as long as the goods from that market aren't globally needed. The fact that people can no longer buy a certain commodity in Switzerland shouldn't really affect the trading of another commodity between China and India. I simply see less and less need for regulation as the number of bitcoin users increases. If I'm wrong I'd like to learn what am I missing and why you feel central regulation is so important globally?


Again, you're ignoring the fact that thousands of new merchants are accepting bitcoin as a value transfer tool (and immediately receiving business), which creates incentive not to use it *only* as a value store, which decreases volatility. Current market trends show this is true. Corrections are happening, but are relatively smaller and smaller. This is an ongoing process, and while it's perfectly fine to remain skeptical, it would be blind to disregard it altogether. Why do you, as an economist, fail to see this growing marketplace and it's future effects on the reduction of volatility (or if you see it, why do you dismiss it as irrelevant)?


For one, this is an assumption that cannot be measured (you don't know everyone, therefore you can't say "no one"). It can only be used in arguing your personal belief in the strength of bitcoin as a currency. My belief is completely opposite, and I back it with USD/€ invested in bitcoin, therefore refuting your point by reducing volatility. There are less and less people like you, and more and more people like me. Shouldn't logic demand that you accept this as a sign of growing stability?
Secondly, it's not necessary for people to divert *all* their savings/expenditures into bitcoin in order for the stability to increase. Just a little is plenty enough when you look at this globally. I'm happy to use Fiat locally and bitcoin for global trade, and global trade is just a fraction of my expenditures (meaning, I'm safe if things crash). But when you add it up, people like me trading globally can increase the global bitcoin market cap far beyond the strength of any single economy, right?


Regulating away bitcoin's anonymity isn't a downside for bitcoin. If one seriously believes that bitcoin can become a globally accepted currency, they shouldn't be arguing that it needs to remain anonymous. It most certainly cannot. For tax purposes, issuing receipts, accounting, salaries etc... merchants, employers and employees that use bitcoin will have to have registered and monitored BTC addresses the same way they have registered and monitored bank accounts. There is no need (or possibility) for things to be very different in this regard, so this argument is mute. What will be different is the lack of any need for an intermediary banking system to handle transactions.
So, as with any currency, it all boils down to trust, really. That's my simplified view of things. Why do you trust the US dollar? The short answer is - because a lot of other people do. Not because of the US central bank, their aircraft carriers, Hollywood and Superbowl. But because the fact you're aware, at all times, that you can take a US dollar almost anywhere and exchange it for goods and services and other currencies. A lot of people use the USD. So how is bitcoin any different once a lot of people use bitcoin?
**Edit:** Rogue letters. There are probably more.

He didn't drop the QR code on the pavement, he put it in plain sight and the people who took it had to make a choice:
1) do something: steal the money
2) do something: take the money and return it
3) do nothing: and let the man **keep** his money (as far as your decision goes)
It's not the same as someone dropping money on the floor. There the choices are:
1) do something: take the money
2) do something: take the money and return it
3) do nothing: and let the man **lose** his money (as far as your decision goes)
Notice the differences. In the first case, failure to act does not imply the careless person will with **all certainty** lose his funds (that depends on other people watching and their intentions). In the second case, failure to act does imply that with **all certainty** my failure to act will result in the person losing money. 
That's why a better analogy for this situation would be taking the money that's visibly sticking out of one's pocket and then warning the owner. In this case, the certainty of losing money would be equally fuzzy for both examples and would depend on other people watching.
But fuck me and my logic, right?
@_date: 2013-12-13 11:04:45
Of course that's not true, but that's not what I was implying. I was merely stressing that just because it grows rapidly doesn't mean it *has to* fall rapidly too. The premise "rapid growth" does not warrant the conclusion "high risk of downfall" in of itself. The nature of the financial market is the risk factor, not the growth rate itself, and one should look at the underlying reasons for the growth rate, if possible.
If I'm not making any sense, that's quite okay, feel free to slap me around some more until you shake something useful out of me.

Not many people. In reality, this is grossly unnecessary. I'm just a nerd and this is all good fun for me. :)
However, this is quite secure, and the time investment to set everything up is actually quite small. And after setting everything up, it's really convenient to use.
**0. Setup Linux distro:** It would take you approximately 1 hour to setup a Linux distribution on an encrypted USB, install printer drivers, install basic software, download code generators and get ready for work. *(~1 hour setup time with instructions online, 2 if you're an IT n00b)*
**1. Prepare cold storage:** Boot up your PC from a USB drive, open up a generator while offline and generate and print out a couple of paper wallets (+ a PDF copy if you want to store copies on the USB, not much extra work, just another print command for a whole lot of safety). *(~30 minutes)*
**2. Monitor cold storage:** Immediately scan those printed wallet public keys with Mycelium, to have watch-only copies in your phone. Label the keys in the phone and on paper with something like "cold storage  "cold storage  etc. Put away the (still empty) paper wallets in a safe place (or several). *(~15-30 minutes)*
***(~2-3 hours total single time investment)***
**3. Transfer to archive:** Transfer funds to these cold storage addresses from Mycelium when you want to put BTC into "savings" mode. This step is done entirely on the phone. *(~seconds)*
**4. Spend from archive:** Spend the funds in paper wallets by a) swiping the private key of a printed wallet with Mycelium *(preferred, ~seconds)* or b) booting up your USB distro and swiping the digital backup on screen *(~minutes)*
Quite convenient, really. 90% of your time you'll just be using your mobile phone and doing very secure transactions/savings in seconds.
I should write a tutorial.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:50:01


No, you can use any previous backup you generated if it's for the same address keypair. Think of the backup just as a printed out version of the private key in the phone. Another backup is just another print command for the same key. Sure, the password encryption is always different because Mycelium generates a new password for every backup, but it's the same key.
So there's no need to make multiple backups of the same address. You only need to repeat a Mycelium backup if 1) you lose your current backup PDF/printout or 2) you add *another* public address into Mycelium.
You probably found out already that you can have as many public addresses in Mycelium as you want. This effectively means that you manage multiple wallets on the same phone. Every time you create one, you also create a new corresponding private key for that new address. Therefore you need to make another backup to make sure you have the new private keys on paper as well. Today you have only one address in Mycelium, so your current backup is for only that private key. If tomorrow you decide to have 3 addresses in Mycelium, your old backup won't help you recover the 2 new addresses, so you need to make a new backup that will contain all 3.

What exactly is *good* about debt-driven, inflationary, inherently worthless fiat, then?
I'm no economics scientician, but even before crypto-currencies kindled my interest I could never quite grasp the *goodness* or *usefulness* of the current monetary concept that funnels wealth to the same people that produce fiat out of thin air by letting the citizens pay off the debt created in the process.
I'm having a really hard time understanding why people insist on putting trust in fiat when it's trivial to mathematically prove how utterly ridiculous and unsustainable it is. Even more perplexing is the fact that the same people who so willingly trust an obvious load of hogwash have trouble trusting something like Bitcoin that is designed to - not need trust.

Look at it this way. You invested (probably) something in bitcoin instead of buying food with that money, right? So now spend chunks of bitcoin for daily goods where available, while spending the same amount in USD on an exchange to buy back the spent bitcoin. If you spent 50 USD in BTC for food and toilet paper, at the end of the day pump another 50-75-100 USD in BTC on an exchange.
1. Your bitcoin balance is the same or growing,
2. you further the bitcoin case and help the economy grow,

I loved your questions, so I'll bore the hell out of you with my answers. I simply feel like sharing today. :)


Of course. :) It's a Knoppix live distribution on a small boot partition that asks for the encryption password early in the boot process to unlock the persistent ext3 partition. No password? You boot into a vanilla live USB with no persistence. The worst you can do is destroy the encrypted partition with gparted, thereby destroying the digital backup keys. If I lost the USB stick that's what I want to happen as early as possible, so yes, please do that to unlock the other 30 of the 32 GB of that flash drive and use it (as big of a carrot I could find without spending more than 50 bucks). :D

Good questions!

However, the main local network router is off during printing, and after printing the printer buffer could be flushed by turning off the printer, turning it on and scanning 50-100 random color pages at maximum DPI through the automated feed. I said "could be flushed". I don't do the latter step, because I'm not yet rich or paranoid enough.


I don't trust it, but 1) other people do, 2) I can't build operating systems. So yeah, I have to trust it. And yes, it's offline.


Argh. I hoped noone would ask this question, but I'll answer truthfully however embarrassing it is. :)
Something like this:
I know it by heart, with no chance of forgetting, as it's memorized in a playful fashion (to me, and probably noone else). Memorized in segments which can be mixed and matched in several patterns to form several passwords. Each segment can be memorized and abbreviated into a single word/character and the combination of those segments can be written down as a code directly onto whatever it's locking (on a piece of paper, on the usb stick). This mnemonic technique would go something like this:
* axe = "AKsd8723"
* fez = "XFz854"
* devil = "G66"
* ny other characters are inserted before a segment is glued onto it: # = * $ = *$axe*
So * means nothing to you when you read it, but to me it means *
**tldr;** I brain-encrypt all my passwords everywhere. It works extraordinary well for me and I've been doing it for the last 15 years, but it's completely insane, inefficient and a waste of brainpower. I was bored in highschool.


I think I agreed with you on this one when I said *"...it uses the cold storage public address as the change address, so you can only spend what you want. This doesn't mean you should, of course, changing paper wallets after spending is still the best way to go..."*. ;) Mycelium only stores public keys of cold wallets as watch-only copies. Once I swipe a cold wallet's private key for spending, I archive/discard that keypair altogether and spend everything on that address.


Again, I'm not telling. ;)
Wow, this was fun!

How secure is my bitcoin setup?
* Live Linux USB distro on an AES256 encrypted USB stick used to generate paper wallets. Print to PDF to leave a digital backup on the USB stick, then print to paper for a physical backup at home.
* Mycelium Android wallet with two key pairs used interchangeably for smaller spending (no more than 300 mBTC at any given time). After a certain period of time, generate new transient key pairs for the same daily spending purpose, for added security of not using the same transaction addresses all the time.
* Mycelium has encrypted paper backups of private keys. You print them out, Mycelium generates a password for the encrypted keys and should you lose your phone you can re-import your private keys later on another Android/Mycelium device. Nice touch: the backup also includes the encryption algorithm written down, so you can hire a programmer to decrypt your private keys if Mycelium ceases to exist / is compromised so you can import them elsewhere. **Edit:** Also, you can't spend coins from the phone without entering a 6-digit PIN into Mycelium, and the phone is locked with another 4-digit PIN. Not much than a deterrent, but still.
* Imported public addresses of all paper wallets into Mycelium to monitor cold storage / BTC portfolio balance in watch-only mode. Very nice feature, I see my entire stash and only get to spend up to 300 mBTC that are on the phone.
* Swipe cold storage private keys with Mycelium when ready to spend. Mycelium loads the private key into RAM and uses it to sign the transaction before forgetting the private key forever, therefore not compromising the cold storage security (if you trust Mycelium and your RAM, of course). Also, it uses the cold storage public address as the change address, so you can only spend what you want. This doesn't mean you should do that, of course, changing paper wallets after spending is still the best way to go. But in a pinch when there's no PC around to plug that USB stick into... it's usable.
* In order to help the community and return the favor for using a light wallet client that doesn't host the full blockchain, I run a full bitcoin-qt node at my home PC for shits 'n' giggles.
This is an extremely convenient way for me to use bitcoin exclusively on my phone, with the added security of not losing coins with the phone (encrypted paper backup at home + on the Live USB stick), or at least not a huge amount of them as most are in cold storage.
**Edit:** Had to evict some formatting gremlins.

Just to confirm (because I'm a total bitcoin noob and need to have pictures drawn for me at this point): 
If I have a paper wallet with 10 BTC and use Mycelium to withdraw 5 BTC from that paper wallet into my phone wallet (for spending or whatnot), the paper wallet will still completely safely contain 5 BTC, because Mycelium will use the paper wallet's public address as the change address, effectively sending 5 BTC back into cold storage. On top of that, Mycelium forgets the paper wallet's private key, meaning the cold storage is not compromised and doesn't need to be changed.

The problem is more in the implication that fiat is not virtual, when, in fact, it's more virtual than any cryptocurrency.

They claim (and I have no reason not to believe this, please inform me otherwise if you do) that they converted all their BTC earnings into fiat immediately in order to safeguard their income (which is a logical thing to do in their position, they can't risk hoarding BTC in the case it crashes).
Therefore, their profits are valued at the value of BTC at the time of preorder, not its current value.

Well, that's a bad analogy. The correct analogy would be seeing a $20 bill sticking half way out of a guy's pocket, so in order to prove a point of how unsafe that is, you snatch it and then tell the guy: "PSA: If you keep it in plain sight, someone might take it like I just did!"
Depending on how big that dude is, this educational strategy might have drastically different rates of success. Everything from "Thanks!" to "Thanks, here's your finger I just found on the floor. You shouldn't keep those in plain sight, you never know who might be swinging a machete... you know, like I just did."

This would have to happen without me noticing it gone missing the first time. Or a guest in my home while I sleep. Interesting. Keeping that USB both safe and a secret is very important, it shouldn't be obvious it exists, like the paper backups. No bragging to friends about a cool new mobile distro I have, etc.

This! Good recommendations. Mycelium is an amazing app to use with paper wallets. I keep my BTC in ordinary and BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, swipe them with Mycelium when I want to spend, and only keep the public addresses of my paper wallets in Mycelium for watch-only monitoring purposes.
The Mycelium hot wallet never contains more than a couple of dozen millibits at any given time for daily spending online or funding the reddit tip bot, so even if the phone is compromised (which you've demonstrated to be unlikely), I can't lose much.
I feel this is not only a safe arrangement, but it's also very convenient to use, much more so than firing up a laptop or PC to sign transactions. I'm using exclusively Mycelium + paper and am loving it.
*(To avoid bitchy comments, I should note I also run a bitcoin-qt node on my almost-always online desktop PC just for fun and network support, but never use it as a wallet. Spread the love! &lt;3)*

Although I wholeheartedly agree with your cautionary sentiment, and caution others the same way, I'd just like to point out a flaw in your logic. 


One does not (need to) follow from the other. It's like saying: "Since the amount of computer processing power is rapidly increasing, it can also rapidly decrease." That's a perfectly fine sentence, up to the point it's not actually true.
The *reasons* for the growth are what's important, so in this regard short-term volatility is allowed to be decoupled from the long-term growth rate.

Good question - I don't have the answer, but the reddit thread I linked to in my previous comment is fresh (posted today) and still monitored by the dev team, so go ahead and ask there!

 There is no "internet grammar". There are people who either follow proper grammar or call it funny magic names to hide the fact they have none.
Edit: I'm not a native speaker and welcome all corrections of my grammar.

A wallet keypair can be described as either **hot** or **cold**.
A hot wallet is any wallet whose private key is contained on a digital device connected to the internet. Your Mycelium wallet is a hot wallet, because your phone stores the private key. Your reddit wallet is hot too - the private key is stored on reddit's servers. If you install Electrum or Bitcoin-QT on your computer, those wallets would be considered hot as well. They're "hot" because the devices that contain them are connected to the internet and can be hacked. If someone hacks your reddit account, they can access your reddit wallet. If someone hacks your Android phone (this is very unlikely, btw, but not impossible), they can gain access to the Mycelium private keys and spend your coins. That's why cautious people never keep large sums of BTC in hot wallets.
The solution to this problem is to create a wallet whose private key never touched an online device. A so called **cold** wallet. The most common example of a cold wallet is a **paper wallet**, that basically stores the private key printed out on a piece of paper. Paper is not on the internet and cannot be hacked.
It's similar to your printed Mycelium backup, but Mycelium **created** the private key on a **hot** online phone and you printed it out later, so your backup is also hot. The point is to create the private key **offline** and never let it touch the internet.
**Creating a cold, paper wallet**
You can create a cold paper wallet by going to [bitaddress.org]( a website that uses a client-side JavaScript address generator. This means that your browser turns into a wallet generator and randomly generates a new keypair for you without using any distant server on the Internet for support. If you load up that website on a trusted computer (that you know has no malware) and then disconnect from the internet, you will essentially be generating offline wallets. You then print them out on a piece of paper and store them in a safe place. Once you close your browser, they will be forgotten by the computer, but will always with you on that flammable piece of cellulose. **So keep it very safe.** If you lose that paper, you lose any Bitcoin deposited on its public address. It's the same as a paper dollar bill, so treat it accordingly, safe from water, fire and -- most importantly -- other people.
So how do you use a paper walelt?
**Funding a paper wallet**
You send BTC to the public address on that paper bill the same way you send BTC to any other public address. You could use Mycelium for that - scan the public QR code and transmit the transaction into the network. Simple as that, your coins are now "offline". You can do this as many times as you want, like throwing coins in a piggy bank.
**Withdrawing funds from a paper wallet with Mycelium**
I suggest you **always** spend money from the paper wallet using Mycelium, as this app follows certain rules to do that safely. Other apps not so much. With Mycelium, open the dropdown menu in the app and select Cold Storage. Scan the **private** key of your paper bill, select the amount you wish to spend and Mycelium will broadcast the transaction into the network.
Simple as that.
**Withdrawing funds from a paper wallet with other methods**
With other apps it's the same - you scan the private key from the paper wallet and spend. However, if you do that, follow this rule:
**Spend all the funds from the paper wallet in the same transaction, at once.** If you have 100 BTC in a paper wallet, and only need to spend 1, transfer all 100 BTC to a hot wallet, spend 1 BTC from there, and transfer 99 BTC back to **another, different paper wallet** for safekeeping. The original paper wallet is now useless. Consider the entire transaction like breaking a piggy bank. Mycelium doesn't break the piggy bank and can spend as much as you need to by pulling BTC out from the tiny crack at the top, but other apps take a hammer, break the piggy bank into pieces, take that 1 BTC for spending, and leave the other 99 BTC spilled on the floor, probably lost forever. This is because of something called **change address** that I won't go into at the moment, you can Google it. It's an important part of how Bitcoin operates, but people have lost money from paper wallets by not understanding it.
Mycelium is really cool to use with paper wallets as it doesn't make you bother with thinking about this, you don't need to understand change addresses. It pulls the BTC out of the crack and leaves the piggy back in tact, safe, and most importantly - cold.
