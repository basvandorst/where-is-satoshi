Thanks for all the replies. I did not have a good backup and the device cannot be repaired.  I now have saved my private keys and backed all my devices up.  Lesson learned.

It only lasted for a few minutes. I finally got on and was able to transfer some coins. Still kind of worries me

I bought all my ETH @ $10 and everything has been a spike since.

Not without a better incentive than the points my CC gives me. You would have to have an attractive discount.

Right now doesn't Bitcoin require a computer or cell phone, electricity, internet connection and the ability to use this stuff.  Right now reaching into my pocket and handing a $10 bill to someone is instant and anonymous.  Most people don't need the ability to transact across the world.  Don't get me wrong, I love BTC, I have a bunch of BTC and I use BTC.  I prefer BTC, But I have a hard time seeing a poor frame, clerk or laborer using it as their currency ??

I think for 90% of the bitcoin holders the price is not down.

I paid over $7 to send $3000 from Gemini to Coinbase.  I thought, Way too much.

Smart. Just plain smart.

I wonder what the miners fee's were ??

How does it work if you don’t have access to the internet ?
