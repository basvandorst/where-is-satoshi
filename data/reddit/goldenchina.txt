The level of hypocrisy is disgusting. Merrill Lynch uses blockchains and now they ban Bitcoin-related investments. Yet Bitcoin is the creator of blockchains. I choose our pioneering developers/contributors.

lesson  If you didnt follow lesson  or came in late. No worries, bitcoin still has lots of potential. You can still buy bitcoin even if you don't have lots of money. You can buy 0.1 of a bitcoin or 0.01 of a bitcoin and so on. Or you can get [cryptonaire]( to make you into a cryptonaire! What ever you do, keep your private keys/seed/hardware-wallet in a safe place!!!

Does anyone else find it odd that BitMEX gets a DDOS attack a few hours before CME goes live? Seem's like someone failed at shorting bitcoin.

Yes, the potential is big! Visa is averaging 150M transactions a day.

I've been seeing lots of blog posts of people having bitcoin or satoshi on their list."  hashtag will help people know we are talking abiut the real deal. Also don't vote Satoshi Nakamoto, that will make people think it's Craig Wright and he supports Bitcoin Cash.

This is very dangerous and bias. Self-regulations should not consist of any exchanges or founders of cryptocurrencies. This whole thing will contaminate the market with self good, rather than the greater good.

This great man once said, "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." I really hope you did everything you wanted do, because unlocking the universe makes you legend. RIP Stephen Hawking, you are legendary.

Let me correct you. Gold has been around before the common era (BCE).

This research firm I follow sent out the best way to filter quality (in other words, bullshit). **D.U.M.B.** *Do or Don't Understand Market Behavior*. Who ever says anything around the lines of that is full of shit because no one understands market behaviour.
