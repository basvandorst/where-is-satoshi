exactly. Great start indeed.
edit: if your image could be more like this... in terms of presentation, it seems the community would very much like it.

You seem to have experience in the design field, what would you consider a fair amount for this request?

Im not asking anyone to work for me, this would benefit all btc holders, i don't profit from this.
Believe it or not, iv been a long time lurker and this is a user iv posted most on. I will honor my end of the deal as stated.

yup, it seemed like a very well thought out article, couldn't finish reading it on my phone and have not been able to find it since, having both sides of the spectrum air their concepts is healthy :)

the image states the info is not true, not sure how that should be perceived in terms of awarding the bounty.

anyone else wondering why coindesk has not reported any of this yet?
maybe that's where Ver's outstanding ended up :)
