I'm certain there are no bitcoin ATMs where I live.

Most likely, though adding a level of indirection seems like it will add complexity and/or expense.

I have no idea what to do with a Linden.  Isn't that a second-life currency?  I feel like this would be going down the rabbit hole further than I need.  Thanks, though.

I've created an account with them, but it will take several days to verify the account (on the outside).  That's no good to me, as I need to buy bitcoin within a day.  Thanks anyway.

Vos isn't an option, though, given my timeframe.  And I have no idea what CaVirtex is, but their website doesn't appear to offer a way to buy bitcoin.

Yeah, that's what I'm trying to use now.  They only allow a "non-trust" (i.e. first-time buyer) to buy 0.2 bitcoin which is held in escrow.
What I'm looking for is more than a link.  I'd like a human being to talk to me like I'm a human being who has never done this before, and who can explain what's normal and what isn't.  So far I've had people ask me for photographs of my passport, drivers license, bills, photographs of my face, $95 service charge, and all sorts of other things, all while offering **no** real information on who I'd be giving my money to.  Could I be forgiven for feeling like I'm being mugged?
Update: I'm conducting the trade very slowly, 0.2 bitcoin at a time, but at least it seems to be working.  The anonymous person doing the selling at least seems to be honest so far, which is nice.  It honestly does feel like "throw your money into this hole and pray," though.

I'm not sure if this was meant as humour or not, but it did make me laugh.  I'm not going to make a virtual dude to use a virtual ATM to virtually buy some virtual money.  May I not retain some dignity?  (If not meant as joke, then thank you for at least trying to help... I do appreciate it.)

If only the a$$hole holding my NAS hostage could wait so long.

It seems like you're right.  The media had led me to believe that it was entering the mainstream, but I think they jumped the gun (which shouldn't surprise me).

They don't seem to have a way to conduct a simple trade.  I just want to give someone money to receive some bitcoin.  There doesn't seem to be any way to do this using their site.

QuickBT is limited to very small transactions (less than $100) every 3 days or so, "for their own protection".  That's no good to me.  It looks like instabt is likewise limited to 0.5 bitcoin, which again is not good enough for my needs.  Thanks, though.
