Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
Kisses him
Thy lips are warm.

O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:52:36
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:17:11
At thy good heart's oppression.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:00:59
There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:25:39
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
