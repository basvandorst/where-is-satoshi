What exactly are we banding together for?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:47:23
Exactly this. Bitcoin is the OG on the block. It is by no means the fastest or cheapest to transfer around value.

my gold stash in D3 is enough to bankrupt this side of the mason dixon in unpaid taxes
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:53:09
There are other options... bitcoin is one of many. Certainly not the fastest or cheapest Transactions

who gives a shit what this shill has to say 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:25:38
I don't have overdraft fees... I dont spend using a debit card. I spend 100% on a rewards card paid off by the end of the month. %0 Intrest is charged doing this. I can't tell you the last time I have paid for a flight or hotel room.  
Double charge is fixed with a phone call but I can't recall the last time thats happenend to me. How would you fix a double bitcoin charge? 
Edit: PS my credit score is phenomenal from this behavior.

Okay I'll enjoy my vacations and you enjoy your processing fees. 
buying senario
I go buy a widget for $150 and swipe my card it's $150 and I get rewards points
Go and buy that same widget for $150 using bit bitcoin It's $150 plus transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:08:05
This is my whole thing... ill never pay with coin even if given the opportunity
1. no consumer protection
1. you the consumer pay the processing fees
1. don't earn rewards points  
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:41:42
Just a realist bud. 
Do you think stores are going to make 2 prices? One special price for bitcoin cause you're paying the trans fee vs them? Doubtful. 
I have plenty of money invested in coin. It's got plenty of room to grow but I cannot see it being widely adapted in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:57:25
Of course I'm careful when sending coin. Its still a stressful thing to do... I cannot call chase to fix the issue if something doesn't work according to plan. 
Which is why I'll pay with my rewards card. No stress at all. Keep it simple. 
It's still a relatively new industry. I'm sure things like this will be addressed, but it's not quite there yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:05:17
Listen to how you're trying to rationalize this...You're out of your mind. 
Is double charging really an issue for you? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:26:54
Pro tip - if you don't spend the bitcoin you have more to grow value on. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:46:34
Whatever makes you feel better... 
BTW it's not really how business owners look at it. I work in the credit card processing industry.  The bill at the end of the month is a real mother fucker for them. They aren't at all thinking boy I'm glad those consumers paid those fees indirectly. 
What about the other 2 points ive made? You giving up rewards and consumer protection so you can see your transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:42:41
Especially if nobody knows your passwords to get your coin 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:07:27
This thread is about governments trying to regulate bitcoin - how they do it is cut off the exchange to USD / FIAT 
me personally - if i couldnt exchange my coin for cash it would have no value to me 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:26:43
Fiat is made by the government - think about that statement again 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:57:40
If they really wanted to it wouldn’t be hard. If they tell all FDIC insured banks they cannot legally allow deposits from exchanges. You’re stuck holding a bag of wizard currency with no value in your real life. You may be able to find a work around to go through other countries. But the end goal is cash money. Fiat. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:39:24
Yep..... this whole story seems illogical 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:16:24
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:04:23
It’s not that bad. 401k up 15% this year..... I know it’s not bitcoin gains but it’s safe gains 
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:37:59
same with all the internet and the computers processing the transctions. WTH kind of troll comment is that? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:53:29
For discussions sake - Why would they enable such a feature? They make the majority of their money on cc processing fees. I’m having a hard time seeing where this would make business sense for them
