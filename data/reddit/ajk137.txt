People kept saying it’s a good time to buy at 16k, 14k, 12k. Broken record.

I have a ticker on my Apple Watch. I probably have a problem.

r/btc but mostly they are obsessed with this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:45:51
This stability is good for my heart.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:47
1800+ am I reading that right ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:04:53
Sure, if you want to buy from a german website.  That outdated system is not used outside of Germany. Otherwise you need to rely on PayPal.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:03:04
I have a feeling it’s not over yet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:56:38
I transfered from my blockchain.info wallet to my Trezor today and it was confirmed in about 15mins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:20:35
You should check out r/Germany. Any negative comment gets automatically downvoted. I even saw a guy make a comment that he didn’t like german bacon get downvoted into oblivion. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:42:01
Annddd back down we go
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:41:50
I bought in at $30, unfortunately my dumb ass only bought 1 BTC. Still held it to this day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:45
Lol “dip”
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:29:09
Yeah so great you can’t even use them buy things online. The banking system in Germany is shit and 15 years outdated.

“Newcomers can earn Bitcoins by downloading the Bitcoin client software and running computationally intensive tasks on their computer. In other words, the longer your computer is left running the Bitcoin client program, the more Bitcoins you'll incur. It runs in the background, and is polite to other software so you shouldn't realize it's there. According to the FAQ, the current rate of earning Bitcoins is about 50 every three weeks.”

Traditional Banking in Europe takes 1-2 days...

Hodl onto your butts
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:30:35
Might as well wait a few hours and buy a few k cheaper 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:42:21
No one knows.

No, as soon as Ver dumps his coins Bcash is dead
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:35
Lol, nope !
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:45
It was confirmed after 15mins 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:29:24
$1k value drop today
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:05:42
Around 0.75 BTC. Don’t know what I set it as but the transfer cost about 20$. Did it though the Blockchain app.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:01:50
I sent mine from a Blockchain.info wallet to a Trezor and got confirmed in 15mins
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:37
90% of their posts are about this sub. They are obsessed. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:05:59
Does that mean someone is trying to sell 1200 or buy?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:29:52
Got it. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:36:09
Saw a few there in 2016
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:44:08
It’s still on its way down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:17:09
I prefer Btrash
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:32
12.8k according to gdax
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:58
Either one. But check the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:05:53
Lol - it's midday here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:58:05
I use bitonic.nl. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:21:12
seriously. If someone offered me a 10k BTC in the summer I would have bitten their hand off.
The only people getting burnt are the late comers who wanted to make a quick buck. 
Holding since 2013 crew checking in. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:27:42
I love that site. Being in Europe it’s my go to site for buying and selling. Soo fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:26
Ath in 2013 was like $1k
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:43:06
Anndddd down we go
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:01:49
This latest movement is a little worrying.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:04:35
Yes it does. If I want to transfer from a uk bank to a german bank it takes 2 days. I know, because I actually live here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:28
No, you are obsessed !!!!!1111
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:00:47
Lol, Germany struggles to accept credit cards / contactless and don’t even have Apple Pay. They have no chance with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:17:57
Still can’t login from mobile app - when can I expect access again?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:44:39
It’s working now. But thanks any, appreciate the reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:18:02
Trezors are pretty much sold out everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:10:59
Dip incoming 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:16:58
There is about 1000 difference between Gdax and coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:42:18
Dip is over. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:17:34
Or when it went from $1200 to $150
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:40:15
On the theory that you would have held until 2017. I'm sure a lot of people would have checked out a lot earlier.
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:18:25
Which app is that?
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:05:48
Nah, 50$ in early 2013 was only 1BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:44:47
Yep, I'm still kicking myself for only investing 50dollars in 2013. But I've still held.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:38:23
There was a massive spike earlier but settled back down now
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:23:09
Same people who panicked at 1200, 5000 etc 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:55:21
Maybe a lot of people would have that as their sell point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:05:22
Looks like we’re on the way back up
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:24:43
You’re selling an iPhone for BTC? 
Depreciating commodity for an increasing commodity. No thanks mate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:07:17
Wow, I still can’t believe that 9k is considered a dip. Never would have thought that possible at the start of the year 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:27
We just hit an all time high right ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:28:34
You can use bitcoin at Netto? Germany has barely heard of contactless payment, since when do they accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:15:17
Not really. The UK &amp; Netherlands is ahead of the curve. Germany is far far behind. They are terrified of anything digital.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:20:24
Anyone know what they did with the BTC? Did they hodl?
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:22:11
I bought in at 30$ unfortunately I only bought 1 BTC. Still held it to this day.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:24:58
!remindme 2024
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:34:00
I'm still holding my investment. Kicking myself about how much I could have made. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:16:39
I bought in at $30= 1 BTC. 
Just wish I had bought more 
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:03:04
I bought in at 1BTC = $30, so I would say I'm not broke yet.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:04:14
What is a bull run?
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:21:11
for people who hold their coin on blockchain? Anything we need to do before 1st august ?
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:20:08
I have 1 BTC in a Blockchain account. Do I need to move that?
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:13:39
Lmao and here in Germany I struggle to find places that accept visa !
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:40:46
Thanks for the explanation !
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:40:45
To be honest, I bought 1 BTC years ago (at 30 dollars) and not really done anything else with it. Got it in an account on blockchain. I have the backup phrase but don't know how to get the private key.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:20:35
Yep, same in UK
