Agreed. The hype is gone. The tech is iffy. The world thinks it's a joke. It's just going to be a meaningless mexican hodl-off for years.    
Nothing but sideways

You address it purely from the investment side. The coin number is finite, but the system is infinitely better, and that real, better, and desirable utility will check and balance, and divide the coins to a near infinite spread of worldwide stability.

The only thing bitcoin is good for is quick easy transfer of fiat-money-representation tokens. Bitcoins themselves will never be worth anything. And if they get banned from fiat transfer the game is over. And if they don't get banned it will be a miracle. Because big gov don't just let anyone in to the big club.
