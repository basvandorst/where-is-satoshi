I'm thinking of getting an Antminer S9 or possibly waiting until newer hardware comes out.   If I mine bitcoin for income purposes, would it be good to first create a small business or LLC, for tax purposes?  Can I write off purchase of an ASIC as a business expense?  (I also have basically zero knowledge of creating a business. )

Heh, good thing I don't use conbase anymore.

Ridiculously better, I don't even log into coinbase anymore.

This actually happened to a lot of "customers" once until CFPB cracked down on it.

How does a bank have any authority to limit what you spend your money on, short of it being for criminal purposes?

Is there any way to move btc from an exchange to an offline wallet without incurring a transaction fee?

This just makes me disappointed in Harvard academics.

Any monkey can plot data and make a line of best fit.  Just some idiot economist seeing a pattern that's not actually there.  Dutch tulips followed a "Moore's Law" in pricing throughout the 1630's, until one day when they didn't.  If it truly followed ML, there should never be any price retreat.

I buy BTC using Gemini.  After an initial wire transfer from my credit union they partially refunded, I can now transfer money into the exchange for free.  I also use Trezor since it was easy and simple to use.

So, how much longer can we sustain this?  How soon until everything collapses?
