Not true.

So which are the bitcoin debit card that are not affected by this and still usable? (mastercard or Visa not issued by WaveCrest)?

I like pussy but not women themselves :) 
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:59:09
That of course I know thanks. My question is related about how that transaction can be connected to an account or to an ip address :) 
@_date: 2018-10-23 11:15:57
Did they give you a cheque with your money so you can deposit them in another bank? 
@_date: 2016-12-06 17:09:16
Is it maybe they are in a compressed form? Try to check details of your private keys in bitaddres.org 
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:51:26
Oh well that's fine I thought much worse. Anway it's a process that can be stopped and resumed right? I mean if I close the bitcoin qt the downloaded blocks will anyway be saved. My laptop is pretty fast it's just one year old and it's an i7 processor. I guess 48 hours in total with stops will be for me maybe a week :)
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:42:42
Great I have set it. Thanks a lot. What is your ETA? :)
@_date: 2016-11-15 15:44:03
It's funny nobody asks who pays the interest? From where do those money come from? :) 
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:30:26
Than why don't you embrace a model where one person or a bunch of people decide for everyone because they are "enlightened"?
@_date: 2016-11-15 16:27:14
Big miners are just countable in two hands. Do you think if they want to make a 51% attack is because they can't? It's because they dont want!

Where do you see the stats about bakkt? I mean volume and daily purchases. Thanks in advance
@_date: 2016-12-19 12:15:16
thanks for the answer. I have a lot of free space. 
What I can add is that I checked the file debug.txt and the last three raws are:
2016-12-19 12:08:13 LevelDB read failure: Corruption: block checksum mismatch
2016-12-19 12:08:13 Corruption: block checksum mismatch
2016-12-19 12:08:17 Error reading from database: Database corrupted
I think it relates to this. What can I do?
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:42:30
What is JM?
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:45:28
That's correct. Localbitcoins anyway have prices for bid and ask that never touch each other. It's really hard to get a deal most of the buyers would do it for speculation. Bitcoin atm is an option but there are not where i live. Does someone have particular good experience with one card product?
@_date: 2015-08-18 12:46:06
It's just perceived leverage right? Because in the end you really have to get it or still it can be that PayPal gives the funds back anyway. It will be impossible maybe until eBay doesn't clarify what to do. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:25:23
It's sad how this way that secures 100% trust or at least much more than a tracking number for phisical goods isn't accepted as proof by PayPal and eBay. 
Does someone know if it's possible to be payed via wire transfer so the transaction is very unlikely to be reversed? 
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:01:28
Because banks outside the EU which offer eur denominated account dont have an IBAN
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:58:31
What? 
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:58:20
Euro bank accounts outside Europe e 
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:57:36
This is not true. You can have denominated eur bank account but not with IBAN, just account number
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:46:29
What does this page do?
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:45:52
Well not really. What I meant. I can't really elaborate my concept. I hope someone else get it and reply 
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:26:59
Yes I use dumpprivkey after it ends the process of rescanning. Just to check and I recieve this error.
Also I cannot see the balance of the wallet...it's all 0.00000000 as if never has been imported. The only difference is that if I go to "file -&gt; recieving wallets" than I see three other wallets which are in a different format (i guess) from the one I imported. Please help
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:42:47
Oh sorry sorrt it's not a 64 character hexadecimal string. It's in the format with letters and numbers from A to Z and 0 to 9. It begins with K
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:54:52
I think the last three months of flatness make people feel now it's the apocalypse. When just a bit more than 3 months ago this was very common. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:54:19
In which exchange have the coins been sold? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:41:09
My private key looks exactly like a 64 character hexadecimal key. I imported keys often in the past. I also doublecheck on bitaddress.org by imput the private key and I get the wallet with the balance.
I use the console as I always did in the past. 
What I can add is that since I upgraded at 0.17 the client generated a file named as my private key in the same folder of the launching icon.
I don't understand. It doesent look very safe to me. But I cannot import the wallet.
If I load (by putting it in the wallet folder) a wallet.dat that I generated before than it works. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:47:36
Yeah, what did you do on that site? Just by opening it?
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:54:34
Oh I understand I'm not that advanced. Maybe I should learn a bit more. Anyway I don't really understand.
In my opinion it has to do with the HD wallet generator. I read something about the command 'upgradewallet' . Is it that maybe I need that? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:19:36
Many other coins are ETH tokens or can be purchased directly on the main exchanges.
Can you come up with just one of the top 20 coins that cannot be purchased directly for Fiat in one exchange or that is not an ETH token? 
@_date: 2016-09-18 15:30:05
Don't you think it's bad to have posted the url in reddit if just by opning the site you get infected??
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:18:47
Actually I want to open a formal claim and post the results. It's less than 10k usd but I want to go deep. I have time and money to do it
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:20:27
Yes absolutely
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:31:29
Well also btc has inflation for the next 100 years or so. So what? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:39:24
So what was the price in 2014?
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:51:34
Thank you Merlin Mage
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:09:57
I add that I cannot see the final balance too, of course. And that if I go to "File -&gt; Reciving wallets" I see three different addresses. I saw around in some forums that you can send the balance to those addresses. But how if I cannot see the balances and the client doesn't recognize my private key?
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:46:14
Value and 'being accepted as payment' is NOT the same

Btc a safe heaven??? Im in crypto since more than 6 years and crypto is not a safe heaven 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:15:42
Well I never wrote here about that. I wanted to try actually...
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:10:54
Clearly no small player can do this. There is nothing you can do

When bitcoin ETF? 
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:37:45
Why can thay get that high price conversion rate?
It's around 900usd.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:18:02
This is unrelated. What does that website do? 
@_date: 2016-10-23 23:11:02
It does not look like this...
