Have you not seen how btc has been dropping for the last 4 days? Pull back for bch is healthy and needs to consolidate.. This is basic technical analysis.. No cryptocurrency or stocks can go up forever. It's more being overbought and correcting

Gold has been going up ever since the uncertainty of the stock market. Gold is considered a safe haven. If bitcoin is remotely a safe haven, bitcoin should have also gone up during the bear market of the stock market. however, bitcoin has been in a bear market, despite the stock market

being 20% from ATH does not really mean anything to cryptocurrencies. For stocks, it's a different story because there is valuation, P/E ratios, future guidance, and other formulas that can get the price for the stock. Cryptocurrency is being valued by abstract future speculation. it could fall more or start going back up... thats why cryptocurrencies are so voliatile.
