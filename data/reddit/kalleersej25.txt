I think the guy who posted the video might have been keylogged or something. But I think the guy is just trying to get attention. Because he put his own ref link in the description, he is just trying to get ref people so he can earn more money. I see why this could turn someone off from the company, but I think the guy haven't thought about it could have been his own pc security!!

@ coinbase it is only the thing that is insured is the BTC in there hot wallets, and not the cold stored "Up to 97% of customer funds are stored offline (disconnected from the internet) in bank vaults to prevent theft or loss." all of this is not insured "3%" of the BTC they hold are!!! be aware! - and i don't like the fact that you have to give personal info either like passport or other IDs
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:22:39

hackers does not mean scam! just because the company had a security breach does not make them a scam. they could just have been people trying to run a legit business, and then they had a security breach, u don't know?
and BTW I've been mining there for more then 2 months, and getting payouts. how long time have you been mining there since you can start to call them a scam? 
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:34:31

@_date: 2015-09-03 07:29:19
Not really the answer I was looking for
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:45:53
Yes you could plug up all the USB holes. And you might wanna get a power USB hub with like 10 ports, 1 for a small USB fan and the rest for miners 
@_date: 2015-09-03 07:41:31
You should setup a full node on the laptop, and buy some asic miners, since you have free power ezz money. I know you are gonna Need a bit of money to get started, but I think it would be a decent investment for you. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:29:55
Dear "valued costumer" 
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:41:37
I think you can't make that much profit from using USB miners, but if you have a Lan connection you can just plug in a miner and a psu, and you are gonna be making a lot more than if you just spend your money on USB miners. I will try to find something for you tomorrow, it is quite late where I am. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:12:11
the fan are for the miners, some miners don't have a very large heat spreader on 'em, and the might get too hot. I would start off by looking on ebay/amazon to see if i could find some miners there for cheap. What is your budget, i can see if i can find something for you
