I think the reason you're being down voted is that people haven't typically looked at the [multi-touch input sensor comparisons which show that the iPhone 5 is 2.5 times more responsive that S4]( or [the news articles reporting on software that recognizes speed tests and dramatically over-clocks the hardware.](
I feel like Apple is held to a higher standard than the rest, that's fine. It keeps them strong.

And all press is good press.

The main point I was making is that their is a certain speed in Apple devices which people recognize at some level (lack of lag in muli-touch sensors), and that Googles privacy policies are a bit too loose for my taste. I don't care what phones ya'll buy, just don't minimize Apple as a competitor.

So: When you consider that Google sells your data to advertisers (classy), works with companies who falsely advertise hardware performance (hardware with slow input processing that can not be optimized with software) with the fact that Apple has better hardware (64 bit, separate processor for motion), award winning support, concern about your privacy, and a larger app store and suddenly home-screen replacements that you never install become a lot less attractive.
