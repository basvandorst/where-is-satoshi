redditor for 2 days and can't spell the word "falling"
probably legit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:30:29
The market is a little flooded right now if you want faster times use a higher fee or just be patient. I had a transaction that took 3 days because I used a minimal fee but it did go through finally last night.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:52:15
Haha makes perfect sense

Wtf is your problem dude. Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:51:00
I mean I use bovada and you guys are legit for the most part but come on don’t spam these boards with this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:49:31
It's a very low fee and a very low transaction. I just sent over 1k with a small fee and it took 4 days to confirm. be patient.

But can you hodl? That is the real question.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:50:59
But it should clear sometime soon right? I’m sorry to sound like such a noob here but every time I’ve sent bitcoin before it’s been pretty quick and this is just making me nervous
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:04:37
Learn to spell, dumbass.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:03:42
Gotcha. Thank you bro helps my peace of mind lol
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:57:19
Well you did say you're "entirely broke" after losing the $105 or whatever so what are we supposed to think?
Either way, $105 isnt a lot of money. I'd move on. Earned a lesson.
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:00:47
The answer to your question is pretty obvious. Your choice to invest all of your $105 into bitcoin is not, however.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:20:24
If you only have $105 to keep from being "completely  broke" maybe you shouldnt have it all in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:36:11
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, brother. Want that head on over to r/sportsbook and buy your bitcoin on a book and bet on a game you like lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:37:34
That’s some neckbeardy shit lol

There are literally hundreds of topics asking this plus a guide on the side bar. Please look there before clogging up the sub.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:14:27
What makes you say that? sorry i'm kind of a noob to this
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:26:25
In one day it's gone up $929.99 where did i say anything about 36 hours? not sure why you're so triggered damn.
Still is down 45.24% in one month and that's what i'm talking about. again you're proving my point. You only are seeing the current hike and somehow forgetting about the major crash that just happened? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:52:50
If you're talking about me i've been in the bitcoin game since it was about $500. Pulled out the majority when it was @ 17k.  Definitely not trying to "double my money in the last month" not sure what you're getting at i suppose?
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:20:06
"True HODLers" could have had twice as much money as they do now a few months ago if they cashed out and then bought more ;)
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:53:47
What I'm more getting at is the fact that it dropped 50% in such a small amount of time is going to do a ton of damage to bitcoins name yet people care more about a small uptick in price while completely seeming to forget what a mess the weeks before were lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:00:03
Guys i'm not trolling but i'm confused about this. So bitcoin went back up a bit...cool but it's still down 50% from a month ago so all this sudden love about a small increase is sort of early if you ask me lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:18:24
Projecting a little? Obviously my comment was sarcastic lol. Damn bro idk if you're just having a shitty day because you lost half your money in the last month or what but I hope stuff turns around for you. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:17:17
You really can't use that much punctuation and claim you're not triggered. Just sayin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:45:06
I've made over 10x my investment even if i sold out today. It doesn't change the fact that bitcoin and crypto is down a crazy amount from just a few weeks ago. People are so easy to get hype over a small gain but don't seem to care about the massive drop suddenly because of that. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:52:51
Lol or own property?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:29:34
Dropped almost 50% since the start of the year. That's insane and i'm not sure why nobody seems to care about that. I made bank with bitcoin over the last 3 years and personally got out when it capped (well actually got out around 17k but close enough) i'm not talking about bitcoin from a year ago, i'm talking about bitcoin so far THIS year. a 50% dip is in no way good for bitcoin yet people are memeing up a 14% or so rise in a day? makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:21:14
If you read what i wrote i pulled out the majority of my bitcoin at 17k and i'm glad i did. I made a huge profit. I'm talking about the loss of 50% of bitcoins value in a few weeks and everyone suddenly celebrating the fact it's gone up like 15% lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:41:35
Thats what i'm saying. It crashed that much in that short of time but people are celebrating it going up a few hundred bucks?
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:13:46
I said it dropped 50% since the start of the year.nothing about an entire year. You literally just proved my point about people ignoring LITERALLY losing 50% of an asset in a month and for some reason brushing that off like its no biggie. December was bitcoins chance to become mainstream and now the casual buyer who bought in lost half their investment. That will tarnish people's feelings towards crypto for years imo.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:12:46
I bought a pretty large amount when it was around $500 or so. I was a "HODLER" until it hit 17k and i sold about 2/3rds because I knew it was rising too fast. I still have a large chuck of bitcoin but this crash is horrible for crypto's image to casual buyers and just reduces public confidence in bitcoin. But all i see here is memes when it rises a tiny amount and they ignore the massive crash and losses to tons of people...doesn't help bitcoin at all but good luck telling people here that lol
