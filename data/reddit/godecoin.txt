The 400K 1AY address is very interesting, however the inputs just don't look like an exchange (all speculation, I know). It looks much more like a huge mining operation with lots of fresh coins the oldest of which came from this address:
That's a very early adopter!
So the question is who was in control of 400K bitcoins in 2011? And there is one candidate: knightmb. The story is here:
He was running a massive Amazon cloud mining operation and he also bought bitcoins directly from other miners and early adopters (it's all in that thread, user: knightmb).
Still, the 400K 1AY address is important even if it's not MtGox. It was responsible for both of the recent spikes in bitcoin days destroyed (Dec 22 and Feb 5).
Have fun clicking around to see where the coins went:
Start with the 150k part, those coins are mostly unspent, except:
10K BTC (2011-06-12 to MtGox):
10K BTC (2011-06-12 to MtGox):
10K BTC (2011-06-12 to MtGox):
34512.819 BTC some kind of ongoing spending:
The rest of that 150k caused the Dec 22 bitcoins days destroyed event, except these:
4,691.9997 BTC:
7,454.99995001 BTC:
2,395.99995 BTC:
4,837.9996 BTC:
which caused the Feb 5 bitcoins days destroyed event (so there's a clear link between the two events). But a lot more coins are needed to account for the Feb 5 event and I don't know where the rest came from (defenetly not the 400k address though, at least I don't see how?).
As for the 250k part originating from 1AY. Most ended up on MtGox 1KLah address and were probably simply sold at that time (in 2011).

He used liberalising, prioritising, optimisation, parallelisation and he does make typos so it's not like he used spell check all the time.
also this sentence "Many small flats have electric heat out of convenience." flats = apartments.
another one: "I favour the plan to monitor if the frequency of blocks received drops too slow." favour = favor

From that post:


Perhaps the 25K coins were later bought by knightmb and transferred to 1AY by him?
