No need to re-buy...if you want to take profits go for it, just pull some money out and there's your profit and leave in what you want to hodl. I don't really understand what you're asking?

No because the price of the bitcoins have changed.  So let's say for arguments sake you originally buy:
2 bitcoins for $100 each (total investment of $200).
The price of bitcoin then goes up to $300 per coin.  So you now have $600 worth of Bitcoin that you paid $200 for.  $600-$200 = $400 profit.  Great!
Now if you were to take out the $400, you would be selling 1.33 coins and keeping 0.66 coins.  So you now have $400 cash in your hands and 0.66 coins valued at $200.  
Now the price of bitcoin goes up to $400.  You buy back in, but now you can only buy 1 bitcoin since you only have $400.  Therefore your total number of bitcoins is now 1.66 valued at $666 (1.66 * $400).  If you had just held onto the coins and didn't touch anything at all, you would have 2 full coins now worth $800.  So you've lost $133 in value by buying back in.
Basically, if you take profits then great! Enjoy them.  But if you think it's still going to go up, and it does, you can only lose money by buying back in.  If the price goes down, you can then make money by increasing the number of coins you have.

I see what you mean, but I think it's important to note that FUN solves problems that a regular online casino using crypto would still have.  FUN is a blockchain technology platform; they provide the games and the servers and all of the other barriers to entry most online casinos might have.  They then leverage the tech to provide provably fair games.  All casinos using the FUN platform will have to use FUN as the token. 
Of course, it could and probably will fail, but it's my moonshot token.  I think it'll either be worthless or revolutionize the industry and shoot up to a few dollars per coin.

People place limit buys and sells around round numbers.  That's why you may see the price climb steadily towards $10,000, then "bounce" off of it and go down.  There isn't enough demand at $10k to fill all of those limit sells, so the price rebounds off of it.  Once that sell wall is "eaten away" by people wanting to buy, then there is often not much resistance to the next round number.  Look out for this next time we approach a round number, it's kind of cool.  Then once we cross a round number threshold, you may blow past it temporarily as the resistance breaks.
