Hi everyone! After participating in the development of Proof of Existence and Streamium, part of the team building them joined to start a company. We are working hard on this new project which we think is really ambitious and worth putting our best efforts in. We are using blockchain technology to improve the way new companies are built. We believe a great deal of bureaucracy can be removed by replacing paper-based processes with more up-to-date technology :)

"blockchain bloat" is just a way of saying "I don't like your transactions". Even though I don't like gambling, my full node stores about 2GB of gambling transactions. Will I ask gamblers to create a separate blockchain for their specific use? No. I only stick to the protocol rules. Bitcoin is decentralized both in design and in philosophy. So, if you want to apply your own subjective opinions about which transactions are valid and which aren't, go use other technologies. 
That said, I think alternative uses of the network, like document timestamping, give more value to it. We should experiment more in this areas, not shut them down. But that's just my opinion.

Interesting thoughts. You can always upload the file into the bittorrent network, and have distributed (voluntary) storage of the files. Memorable/important files will be preserved, and you can still use the blockchain to prove it's existence at a certain point in time. I don't think using the blockchain for storage of data beyond hashes is reasonable/optimal.

My translation: 
Title: New AFIP measure increases online shopping cost by 50% for foreign sites.
The government now requires a sworn declaration to remove any package from customs. With this instrument, it looks charge an existing tax that was not being enforced. 
With the objective of stopping the USD leakage from the country, AFIP widened the economic lock and implemented a measure to discourage online shopping on foreign sites. Cheaper prices, free shipping, and access to a great variety of products had converted many sites into a great option for many Argentines.
Now, with the sworn declaration requirement, consumers will need to detail which product they bought and, if needed, pay the corresponding charges via an Electronic Payment Handbill (VEP). A Fiscal Key with level 2 security is needed to complete this process.
[this means they added a lot of bureaucratic hassle to further discourage online shopping]
I love my country!! :s

You're totally right. The verification process is not intuitive right now (it's the most common feedback I get). For now, you need to re-submit your doc, and you'll go to the document's page, which contains the timestamp. This sucks and is not intuitive. I'll work on improving the verification process, and I'm happy to receive ideas about this

Nice! I was planning to build a similar site using [bitcore]( early next year. Did you try the library? You could implement script validation with it (actually executing the scripts). Let me know if you need help!

Awesome idea, dude! I'll email the professors of the online courses I did in the past
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:05:59
Excellent points Sarah! As you mentioned, the way to verify a document is to re-submit it. Right now the app doesn't look into the blockchain, because it stores the txid of the transaction which proves the document (just looking up that transaction in the blockchain is enough)
Your idea of making this interoperable with other people inserting is super interesting! I already have a standard format for the documents, [which is explained here]( I'll see if I can add a way of searching for that pattern in the blockchain, so that the app recognizes externally created timestamps!

Hi Jimmy, thanks for taking the time to learn about this awesome new technology.
Coinbase is like a bitcoin bank. They store the BTC for you but have complete control over your funds. They actually maintain a database of account balances instead of relying in the bitcoin blockchain (a distributed ledger) to manage your account. That's why they can move your bitcoins around without your direct action. You have to trust them to have those coins when you want them back, as happens with banks and regular money.
I'd recommend you set up a wallet in which you are in direct and complete control of your coins (which is the whole idea of bitcoin, eliminate the need of trust for managing your money). Some good and secure online wallets are blockchain.info/wallet and bitgo.com
Thanks again for your time! Hope you find, as many of us have, the potential in bitcoin to change the world for the better :)
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:51:31

btw: if I find some free time I'll create a prototype site and update
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:09:04
Let me summarize what I understood, just to be clear:
- Payee generates a BIP32 hardened branch for each payer. The payer can generate any amount of receiving addresses for the payee. 
- When Payer wants to send a payment, he grabs X unspent outputs he owns, and generates X receiving addresses. He can then send a tx to Payer where all of his X outputs are spent "in parallel", avoiding merging them. This is great privacy for Payer.
- When Payee loads his wallet, it scans addresses for all the payer branches, until it finds a N-gap. A N-gap is a set of N contiguous unused addresses (addresses with no transactions). In this way, he can always be aware of all incoming payments, and who they correspond to. 
- Because each payer knows only his/her own "payer branch", he can't see all the other transactions received by Payee.

Interesting points, thanks! There's also the public key ordering problem. The P2SH address changes depending on which order you put the public keys into the script. From what I've learned, the best-practice for now is to order the public keys lexicographically. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:27:44
Nice! You were the first user of the beta version :D  
Regarding your question: no, just the file contents. Try changing the file name and re-submitting it [in the homepage]( and it should redirect you to the same document detail page. (Let me know if it doesn't!!!)

Sorry about that!  
Why do you say you can't enter a change address anymore? The change address is where you'll receive the remaining bitcoins after the payment channel is closed. It's not related to the funding transaction. Maybe that's not clear?  
I'm really sorry to hear you lost funds... do you have the tab still open? Maybe I can help recover the private key 
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:58:38
Manuel from bitpay here,
Running the code on master works as expected:
    var addr = new Address("1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa");
    console.log(addr.isValid()); // outputs true
    var addr2 = new Address("1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNb");
    console.log(addr2.isValid()); // outputs false
However, running the same code in the bitcore.io browser console ( prints true twice. I remember fixing address validation a long time ago. Maybe the version running on the site is old. Are you running it locally or in the browser console?

The funds don't go directly to the streamer's address. Streamium uses a protocol called "Payment Channels", which uses a temporary 2-of-2 p2sh multisig address between the viewer and the streamer. Funds go from this intermediary address to the streamer and the viewer's change address (increasingly more funds go to the streamer as time passes by), in the payment transaction. This is what makes payment channels trustless and the first pay-as-you-go payment mechanism! :)
Hope this helps, if you have any other question please let us know.

Was trying sig3 yesterday, and your automated cosigner doesn't reject transactions when the conditions are not met. You just don't sign them, which is annoying, because the funds will still be locked in the wallet. Is there a reason you don't reject the tx proposals and only ignore them?
@_date: 2015-09-23 22:16:09
I was using it on a 2-of-2 to test. I would probably use it in a 2-of-3 normally. Still the bot should be able to reject, for a better experience.

I like the idea. I'd recommend to use coin-age as a way to demonstrate value, to avoid gifting coins to the miners. With coin-age, basically you'd freeze some coins in an address and use its key-pair as an identity.

Now that I think about it, if you only store the root hash, you'll need all other documents for that day to check a single hash. That or depend on your server to provide said hashes (which means this is centralized)

These are some of the reasons for which I left the project. I had invested 1 BTC and was attracted by the concept, but after working for a month in that bounty system, I realized it had very weak technical foundations. Luckily I was able to sell my MSC and recover my investment. 
I have now moved to code for the colored coin project, and I'm really comfortable with the technical background it has. Keep an eye on colored coins!

Welcome to Argentina! I'll try to make it 
@_date: 2013-09-26 04:05:56
I'm a freelance developer and most of my clients pay in bitcoin now. It is by far the most efficient payment system I tried. It's also the easiest way for me to invest/save in bitcoins, due to the monetary blockade we have here in Argentina. I'm still waiting to be easier to *spend* bitcoins directly here than to sell and spend fiat. Step by step we will get to that!
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:58:16

I've been developing this app for the last couple of days. Right now the proofs are stored in a database, but if people start using the service, I'd like to implement storing them (the 256 character-long proofs) in the blockchain to have decentralized timestamping for the proofs. 
This would solve the document existence proof problem. I am also thinking of allowing the documents to be stored in my database, and the cryptographic proof in the blockchain, to create a way to publish certified documents requiring no trust in any party. What do you think?
@_date: 2013-09-10 05:19:27

I love this idea, but every time I think about it I remember the more localized an altcoin is, the easier it would be to attack by a powerful outsider. Have you thought of any viable solutions to that? I'd love to discuss this idea further
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:38:04

Not 50%, but some private agencies report 30%. Of course government says it's 10%, and has imposed fines on such private agencies for dissenting. Look at this joke, our former Minister of Economy:

Hey! I'm the developer of proofofexistence.com. It's great that others are implementing this. I considered using Merkle Trees, but decided not to, because I want individual timestamps for each document. We should talk about more efficient methods to store data in the blockchain (OP_RETURN, private keys, etc). If you are interested send me a PM and we can talk.

We already had to pay 20% extra for any international purchase (delivered products, tourism, anything). Today, AFIP (national tax agency) raised it to 35%. I don't even understand how they can do this without passing through congress :(
@_date: 2013-05-29 12:10:32
I will release the code, once I tidy it up :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:44:27
"If you don't like it, feel free to move somewhere else" is the intellectually laziest argument I hear these days. Would you abandon everything (job, loved ones, etc) because you think somethings wrong with the system? Better fight to change it.
Anyway, given your last comment, I think you are trolling...
@_date: 2013-09-24 10:30:31
TIL some bomb defusing tricks ^^
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:01:20
Hmm... I've been thinking. Calculating the hash locally would allow anyone to change the client-side code, thus allowing them to store arbitrary data. (How can I know if the data received is a hash or actual data?) I'm not sure if I want to allow this yet. (I fear it might damage the bitcoin network). I'll study the possibility of creating a bitcoin fork for arbitrary data storage, though.

@_date: 2013-05-16 22:27:26
Thanks for your feedback. This is exactly the problem I'm trying to attack, and it would require storing the hashes in the bitcoin blockchain (which is not yet implemented, but I wanted to debate the idea before starting to work). What do you think?
@_date: 2013-11-16 15:54:04

@_date: 2013-12-13 20:06:47
Thanks, but no, they don't accept OP_RETURN txs. I tried that pushtxn script with a sample OP_RETURN tx but it won't do it. Here's the tx if you want to try.  and here you can check it is well-formed:  If you know of any other way to relay this transaction let me know!

Works from argentina too!
@_date: 2013-08-05 18:46:56
Being myself an Argentinean, I can confirm I tried buying US dollars officially 5 or 6 times (for different reasons) and I got rejected by AFIP on 100% of the attempts. 
We can still buy online with credit cards but we have a 20% surcharge from AFIP on each purcahse. Cash extractions in neighboring countries are limited to 50 USD per month.
So, yeah, we are kinda "forced" to use local pesos. Seems legit, go freedom!
@_date: 2013-08-06 00:37:58
Yes, but instead of buying BTC just bring dollars and exchange them in the black market for its real price (~8 ARS/USD) instead of the government's official price (~5 ARS/USD)
