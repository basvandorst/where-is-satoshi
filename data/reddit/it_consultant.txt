Can you at least give an idea of the thread name? I'm willing to do my own research but being as vague as "Just search r/btc" is useless. I don't even like bcash, but it annoys me when people make a statement and then refuse to provide sources. Especially since there is a lot of outright lies and misinformation in both subreddits
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:34:11
Low fees are absolutely a valid point. I see so many people like u/Turbodiesel67 saying that bitcoin isn't for poor people. That's bullshit, elitist and frankly just makes you an arsehole. Bitcoin was meant for everyone and to say otherwise completely goes against everything that bitcoin stands for. If anyone believes otherwise they might find more acceptance in the banking sector.

"We're close in age, but I had accomplished more by 20 than you probably will in your life. And your BMI means jackshit. I can smell a pussy and you're just rank with the smell.
As far as a truck, no. I drive luxury cars, which you'll never be able to afford. You'll never even see the interior of cars I like to drive, because you can't afford it, nor can your shit family or friends.
It's funny you think your age gives you a pass on sounding like an idiot. Why would you want to write like an uneducated, unaccomplished loser unless that's what you are...? Hmm."
You're just an arse who likes to attack people. Lord knows why you have this massive chip on your shoulder or why you keep refering to people as Pussies. You should probably talk to someone about that bud. After all you're so rich and have accomplished so much I'm sure you can afford one of the best therapists. Just make sure they don't also have poor clients. We wouldn't want that. ;)

I'm gonna need a source on that before I believe that statement. Care to link to the discussion where people objected to this? My understanding is the EDA will help stabilise both chains and prevent massive fluctuations so this surprised me
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:36:32
You made that statement without citation, and refuse to provide supporting evidence when challenged. The burden of proof is on you. If you can't produce the evidence to back up your claims your point is invalid, sorry.

Erm, Shouldn't need to carefully plan moving my own money?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:21:15
The original use of bitcoin was peer to peer money. Cheap transactions without the use of banks or a 3rd party. This is why I loved bitcoin. If I want to move money I should be able to move it from A to B without having to wait for a convenient time. I'm not a fan of BCH, but you can't deny they've got btc beat on this. Too bad it's controlled by the people it's controlled by, otherwise I would have jumped aboard that train long ago.
The fact that you appear to have conditioned yourself to believe that careful planning and paying a large amount to move your own money is acceptable, is worrying. Considering the fact that one of the reason bitcoin was invented was that you can avoid ridiculous bank fees.
I'll be damned if someone is going to tell me to just deal with it and that is "Just one of those things". A solution needs to be found and soon. Otherwise people are going to eventually jump ship, not to mention that it is going to stop new users from entering. If you think otherwise then stupidity lies with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:33:03
Well I'll be damned. Thanks for the source I will be adding it to my reading list for this evening

I am too provided that functionality isn't compromised. But this isn't the case. Blocks are full even without spam transactions and bitcoin is frankly unusable in the way it was intended.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:32:18
Just scrolling through your post history there can be no doubt of the sort of person you are. It's also clear that you consider anyone with less money than you beneath you. Considering that I'm not you, I really don't have anything to whine about lol

I've been glued to bfx for the entirety of this ordeal... no issues here

Take all of her underwear and tear them into 4 pieces. Keep 3 of each 4 and give her the last piece and tell her she  have them back in 2 years time or less, the market hasn't decided yet
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:50:36
Hopefully it wasn't a substantial amount of money. You may well have lost your friends money.
You will need to contact bittrex

Miners have options other than bitcoin - They are free to pick and choose what coins to mine and are not tied to one. That essentially makes them contractors, not employees and contractors have clients, not employers. Employees are obligated to provide for one company and one company only. Employees need to give notice when they wish to change employer. Employers guarentee their employees with certain rights which contractors are not afforded and none of the above is how bitcoin works.
Yes the block reward is incentive, but there are other chains which are almost equally as profitable to mine and if all your contractors leave at once you are fucked until you can find new contractors (PoW change) and the people you provide a service for (Users) will leave until you can hire more contractors to do the work needed. Some of them may be so annoyed at you they may never return.
No matter how you try to spin it in your mind, to miners the users are clients. Don't make the mistake of not understanding the difference. That's not me being mean, I'm trying to help so you can plan your funds or change your strategies accordingly :)

This is a strawman argument, Just because someone is against excessive moderation doesn't mean that they are pro spam. There is a whole spectrum of stances in between.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:50:27
I'm not in support of the Sx2 hardfork but understand that bitcoin users are clients not employers. Any demands that are placed by clients can be agreed to or the contract can be ended and another client secured. That's just the reality of the situation

If you're into technical analysis, this is actually a bad sign
Here's hoping that TA isn't right in this case!

Trezor has a chip with a vulnerability. As displayed at DEFCON5
As far as I know Nano has no such issue

This is pretty much it. Anything else is greed, you don't know what coin will be worth what, months even years down the line.

Except its a goddamn pain to try and get our money back into fiat without using something like bitbargin. Our banks despise crypto and I have had 3 of my accounts shut down because of it.
Edit, apologies for necropost. I was in the wrong sub and didn't look at the submission date rofl

The difference that the name mcdonalds is owned by a person/company with rights to that name. The name Bitcoin is not owned by anyone. The people decide which bitcoin is the real one and the others fall into obscurity.
If you believe that Bitcoin Core is the real bitcoin then use and promote that one, if you think that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin then use and transact on that one. Which one becomes adopted by the masses is the "Real" bitcoin

I know, i made it for distinction as they are supported by the core developers. As long as the message wasn't lost on people I can put with people pointing that out. But yes, for all intents and purposes it is just bitcoin.
