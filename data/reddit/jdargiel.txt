Yes, but banks lend more then 100% the money there customers have stored there. Several times more actually.

Well, Canton does sign his code with his PGP key, so you can an always verify that no one has modified it since the signing.

Your key is already encrypted with strong encryption using BIP0038 and your password. Further encryption is redundant.

Exchanges can implement this without any protocol function to back this. Simply email the customer "A withdrawal request has been made from your account. You have 15 minutes to cancel it before the transaction is broadcasted to the bitcoin network"

You should make it clear that after step 8 you are done generating the keys and you should immediately shut down your Ubuntu session by turning off your computer. All the following steps may be performed using your regular OS setup while connected to the Internet.

Actually, you don't have to print it using Ubuntu. BIP0038 protects you, so just print the page to PDF, send it to your thumb drive, and print it in Windows, or you could even go to a friend or a retailer to print it. As long as your passphrase is secure, you are covered.

For redundancy?

Printing 3+ wallets gives you spare wallets if you need one. The secure procedure of retrieving funds from a paper wallet is to sweep *ALL* the coins from it, spending what you need, and sending the rest to a *NEW* paper wallet. 
Print 3, and store them securely. Print a copy of the 3 wallets and store the copy "at your mom's place". That way if you ever need to spend some of your coins just send the remaining to the second wallet. Just make a mental note not to send new funds to the old wallet, as it is no longer secure.

The Android bitcoin wallet already has a beta feature for sending transactions over bluetooth. NFC when implemented will be even faster than cards.

I don't think there is a way to bulletproof bitcoin against fraud. Shit will happen, period. 
The problem with mtgox is that the coins didn't go no-one-knows-where. The blockchain has those transactions, It's just that mtgox decided they don't want to disclose these transactions or provide any blockchain proof of the theft.

Should have went for sublime text 3 :-)

I wouldn't be so sure it can't hurt. Powering a damaged drive may damage it beyond recovery. Go find some professionals. If it's safe to simply power it up and download the data they won't charge you thousands of bucks.

BIP0038 encryption protects paper wallets with passwords, thus rendering them useless to thieves

Yup, that's the best way to distinguish scam mail for every service - look at the buttons. /s

The source is as much open as the full client. It doesn't do any outbound request, so there is no reason to trust it any less then the client.

Unixstickers.com have a bitcoin sticker, and they use bitpay.

Or use a BIP0038 encrypted wallet and print it using anything you want... 
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:06:28
For the record: this is not true.

Safe Paper Wallet has a beta with BIP0038 encryption implemented. Although the author warns: "Do not use for real paper wallets – this is a beta"

The format of the hash stored in the database implied that it was 7500 round SHA256. This mail doesn't disclose anything new.

BTCe worked perfectly for me right when it needed to work. I'm fully satisfied.
