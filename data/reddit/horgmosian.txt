Call me a critic but I don't believe a rapper would tweet about a crypto currency he doesn't know about because his publicist told him to lol. I can't say as for him understanding totally what it is but most people don't. At least he's buying in and hodling

Ok, it took a while but I see what you were saying now. I agree it would be amazing to destigmatize the word, but I'm sure lots of black people wouldnt go for that. It's something that will possibly happen over time though, and people like you will be the reason why. Big ups to you for recognizing the nigga in anyone no matter their race ����

No, it's not a term of endearment. They adopted the word and use it but it has no positive connotation on it's own; if it is endearing it's due to the context it's used in. I personally use the word sometimes, but I'm very careful to make sure I don't use it wrong due to the nature of the word. For example when I'm singing along or messing around with my other *white* friends

He did an interview later where he said they ran into each other because they have the same agent and I'm pretty sure she wants the D now. Eric Andres effect on women is something I'll never understand and forever respect

You weren't quite being racist bit that's definitely now how it works
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:31:00
