is it am MAD?  also i think with the advancements in tech in every realm the idea for more sophisticated filtering systems are not an impossibility. point is the rich own the underlying networks that connect us together and could effect the fluidity of the currency.

isnt the point the banks fail and the bitcoin becomes the unified world currency?

unpopular true but honestly where is the line drawn when it comes to limiting access to the internet? when the line comes down to a failing dollar i  think it not out of the question a scenario like i proposed could arise. at least we agree there is potential collapse of the currency. 
also with all the die hards on this sub im not sure if im being dismissed or ignored.

i dont know that this reporters approach was ethical. it grossed me out how he posed as a model train enthusiast and didnt identify himself as a member of the press.

i think it needs a cool nickname or many nicknames like cash before its fully adopted. Bitcoin over and over is hurtful to the ears and even in my inner dialog as i read it.  any suggestions???? i will start with bitnero

well it is but nobody would unplug it....or horde it....or limit its access for their own well being....or realize it is the only resource and is what is invaluable.  
if i could own a piece of something and be confident it appreciating over time i would invest in the overall network. while its abstract i think that would be cool
