I suppose the feeling is so good.

I vote for Trezor, it's reliable and secure storage system, you should use it. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:11:25
I'll celebrate both of them just like that.

Seed is everything you need to recover your coins, about another version I think that with new ones there will be no problem, older ones may, but can tell for sure. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:22:13
Some great features are promoted. Great as always, thanks. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:48:00
Mycelium or breadwallet may do the work. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:15:59
A few days ago I did the same, with no confirmation needs at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:31:54
This looks really nice, thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:34:53
Really creative idea, everybody loves bikini.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:26:39
I don't like the idea to use extension as a wallet. Use Mycelium mobile app. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:21:09
Everything will be fine, just wait a little bit. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:11:59
Localbitcoins.com is one of the options. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:08:05
HODL to the moon!!! Btw huge fan of Game of Thrones, so I like the idea.

Whenever you choose to invest in bitcoin is proper time, you never know what future brings it out. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:18:40
Be patient my friend, that day will come for about 30-40 years.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:44:55
It's probably the low fee, i hope everything go well by now, right?
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:43:49
Around 2012, I want to buy a tool and it was available only with bitcoins so I get involved in that. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:16:26
Use hard wallet like MultiBit HD or Electrum, or from mobile Breadwallet or Mycelium 
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:10:00
Bitcoin Core API is what you need. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:29:21
$1000 already, it growing fast!!
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:20:21
Such a great news, it was expected for sure, Turkish people are heading the right way 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:28:21
I'll stick to HODL!
@_date: 2016-06-07 22:01:29
It's a long time ago, a lot of things are changed by then.

He meant Coinbase Vanity Address, and the term "Vanity Address" indicates to a normal bitcoin address that starts with some string of characters that appeals to you. It's something like having a personalised number plate on your car.

At the end of 2013, from a post on bitcointalk forum.
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:25:18
Not yet, but it's so so close. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:31:44
Switch to HD, everything will be fine that way. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:22:27
Use previous version of MultiBit wallet, then with your key file you can retrieve your coins.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:25:16
Really great news, so I should do the same.Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:09:15
Why is this way in Brazil ?
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:26:29
I prefer HODL!
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:30:38
It's the low fee, wait a little more. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 09:27:00
I hope they will, there's no better option then bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:52:35
At the end who cares, we've got bitcoin and bitcoin network as well, it's inventor is not relevant to me, I'm glad I use bitcoin and that makes me feel happy. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:28:34
Start from yourself, what you think what are you capable to create or develop, and then sell it using Bitcoin. Make sure it's something new and futuristic. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:01:50
No, but will it make a difference at all? 
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:12:21
