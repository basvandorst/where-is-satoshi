I use mostly cold storage instead of exchanges. It would be great to have an address lookup as well as exchange APIs.

Bought from them a few times. Good stickers for a decent price.

That's great, I hadn't seen. Add QR integration and it would be fantastic!

Idk about other countries, but i buy my stuff on newegg.ca for all Canadian shipping. It is a bit more expensive, but with big businesses like that they always write the right value on the package and I end up paying more with the customs fees.

I just withdrew some WDC, so there are some coins still available for withdraw

Yes, Bitcoin is dying. You should sell them all to me for 200$ before the price crashes further down!

You should clean it. Simply insert it in your mouth and swirl it around for a few seconds.

I don't know about the rest of the world, but the Canadian website also accepts BTC

Most bodacious, dude.

But I thought a single pizza cost 10,000 BTC. How did he buy so many with only 2 BTC? I call bullshit on this!

I've used QuadrigaCX in the past and it was really smooth and easy.
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:49:02
QuadrigaCX has pretty low fees for interac iirc

Hey! This got me thinking. Is there a tipbot for tumblr? It might be a good idea to start working on that. There's a big younger audience in reach over there.

Because I have no idea how and don't exactly know what a node is.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:28:30
Canada, so any US site would do also.

Nothing of great rarity I would think. The great majority of what I have are WoW TCG, of mixed series. About 3-4 thousand cards. Most of the value would lie in the WoW loot cards. I ask out of curiosity and interest more than the richness and vastness of what I own.

I'll take that load off your hands if you absolutely need to give them away ;)
