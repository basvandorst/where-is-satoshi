Most sites that use it do tho, look into coinhive, their cdn forces a popup to get approval, I’m jus saying that stoopid articles like this are just demonising blockchain tech, as we all know mainstream media does

So many other quicker options, you’d think they’d diversify, but instead they picked a fork of BTC, I hope to see more from them.

1. I didn’t know who that was.
2. Ima go ahead and assume it’s a bad thing.
3. I was talking about ultcoinnews which is the aggregate site I’ve been using.
Chill lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:18:53
Maybe it’s just an unjustifiable stigma I’ve got lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:01:13
 -- this ultcoinnews site I'm using is still hell new I think, but it's cool
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:29
Well translated

...The epitome of guerilla marketing...
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:21:22
lol, looks like you're with a shitty bank
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:49:28
Stop talking shit or I’ll crash it again

Yeah but if you're using a service that's providing something you like for free, and you don't want to click the dumb ads on their site, it's such a good way to provide that service with a revenue stream, at such a minimal expense to the user
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:28:34
I thought it was an interesting article
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:49:11
I’m Roger Ver man

fuk link didn't work
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:09:43
These are my thoughts exactly
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:19:42
I've held it in the past, and spent it all at a low price (regrettably), and I've returned to this convoluted mess ready to hop back on the bandwagon before eventual mass adoption...which I do believe in. 
Until the scaling problem is fixed, there's no way it's ready to become mainstream...this has to be a bubble lol.
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:57:19
yeah but consider the market cap difference
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:30:06
man idk, I think with the market cap, 300 is a bit of a stretch...
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:48:09
i have my scepticism 
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:12:22
I need a time machine
