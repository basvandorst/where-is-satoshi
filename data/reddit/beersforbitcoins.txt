Was hoping it would pay interest on BTC deposits but doesn't seem to be yet. Anyone have word on this?

"We cannot accept real-money players at or resident in the United States, nor any form of payment which originates or passes through US banking institutions and/or financial instruments."
I (and likely many others) have a pretty clear path of money into an exchange from a US Bank... if they even pretend to give a shit they won't accept most BTC deposits.

Yeah, I didn't particularly want to get into mining but I love beer and bitcoins. Figured this was a good way to do both.

I've heard there are lots of subsidies available, including a recent one from Google. Look into these to be sure you're getting your money's worth.

I have my own worries about falsifying information when I sign up as a "Canadian." I wouldn't blame them for not paying out my BTC if they ever found out I was really a "Southern Canadian," so instead of them taking the heat they just take my money and report me? Fuck this shit.

I'm looking for someone to accept this dollar on a string in exchange for a dollar. No promises I won't pull the string back.
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:42:57
Go to an ATM. Get $20. Mail me $20. I will send you one BTC.

No beer for you then!

On a related note, who the hell is 1KLahQtqDNAXvrjNyfvgSBtAhwco5ZxLp4?!
I currently have 0 bitcoins. Will hopefully be changing that soon.
@_date: 2011-06-09 20:25:49
I have beer and want BTC! Wish I could ship you some, but there's all these "laws" and "fees" involved. If only we could make a decentralized P2P beer...

Wasn't the point of Dwolla the ease of moving money? Or does that only mean moving it between dwolla accounts?
Oh well, aside from the delays I'm not hearing too many complaints. Wish me luck!
@_date: 2011-06-10 00:34:23
don't leave us hanging!
@_date: 2011-08-23 19:14:34
Sweet, I can now link my bank to my Dwolla, my Dwolla to BitInstant, BitInstant to Tradehill, and all those simple steps later I can actually buy bitcoins with money!

The catch is I have no Mt Gox account and don't particularly trust it. You send me bitcoins, I buy beer, everyone's happy. You of course have to be 21+, so that might be a catch. We can hang out and talk about bitcoins while I buy you beers in a bar, or I can just bring you a case. I will likely get on the otc trade channel so I can see and gain trust, but I just thought of this today.

I had the same thought, except Casascius might have a copy of your private key somewhere. I haven't heard any complaints yet, but I've found saving a non-stolen wallet, making backup copies, and keeping them all offline is more secure than myself having one copy of the private key with another person already potentially having it. Additionally, if Casascius DOESN'T save a copy of private keys, and you someone distort the hidden private key underneath, bye bye bitcoin stash.
tl;dr - Shiny! But Casascius could still fuck you.
@_date: 2011-06-10 00:33:15
Jesus. Do you plan on paying taxes on that? How are you getting it out, with MtGox? 
@_date: 2011-06-14 21:58:28

Completely anonymous, completely visible what address has how many bitcoins.

noob can has port forwarding fix?
I've gotten connections at home, work, and the gf's place, and upped my blocks to over 100,000... but it still hasn't downloaded the whole chain. How do I get around this to get more connections to finish the block and start trading?
Yes, I know I'm an idiot. Be kind.

If anyone is interested, I will buy reddit gold in exchange for BTC. I will also buy you beers in exchange for BTC, but you'll probably have to live in Los Angeles.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:17:21
I just check  occasionally throughout the day. If you really want, you can just have it text your phone every time it updates.
@_date: 2011-06-09 22:57:36
Ouch, you've got quite a commute.
I live and work in Hollywood. Dillon's is right near me (and cheap for me) but let me know. You can also email my username at gmail.com if that's easier for you.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:08:58
Find someone in your area who is exchanging BTC for something/cash.
I, for example, will buy beers for anyone with BTC in Los Angeles. Because I like beers. Even if they never sent me my money, I still had beers.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:05:37
Either a liar or a guy who just realized he may be liable for taxes on it, hahahah.

Pretty sure if you're handling fat stacks of cash in and out of bank accounts you'll quickly bump up against anti money laundering laws, but IANAL.

So 1,000,000 credits is one bitcoin? I love this.
