Spend a bit of time here, you haven't even scratched the surface of crazy.

Yes, and then I will censor all the people of the world, even the ones who agree with me, for I am the greatest shill of all time!

Except it's not groveling and if you think that you're an idiot.

Considering the fact that you're probably living in America, this isn't even true. And if it were true, it'd still be better than most other options.

"Main" selling point.

A few days late on this one.

Look, I know AnCaps like to spam as much hyperbolic rhetoric as possible without ever having a coherent argument, and I normally try to ignore that because it's not worth getting into an argument about. But when you state something that is demonstrably wrong and shows a complete lack of understanding the system you're rebelling against is something that must be called out.

DAE government is literally hitler and will do everything to destroy this perfect currency?
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:28:37
Yeah but not "correcthorsebatterystaple".
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:24:50
Yes, us Bitcoiners who are *so* obsessed with nobody knowing *anything* about us to the point of adopting Bitcoin largely for its anonymity status, really need to use that same currency to spy on people.

Well then I'm glad I don't do those three things!

Greed is learned in the same way Obama is Socialist.
That is, only conspiracy theorists think so.

"*and be no longer than 16 letters*"
Seriously, fuck that shit.

Yes, but he said, and I quote, "**and** wants me harmed".
I do not. That wouldn't contribute anything. If anything, it would make him more hysterical and prone to conspiracy theories, which nobody wants.

I've never seen something devolve so quickly from a Libertarian circlejerk to basically anti-Libertarianism. Especially on a circlejerk the level of @_date: 2013-05-31 15:31:20
More importantly, people who talk about the "anonymity" of Bitcoins forget that all bitcoin transactions are public. Someone can trace your wallet and figure out exactly who you are if you're not hilariously paranoid.
Then again, most people here *are* hilariously paranoid so maybe it's actually got some anonymity value.

I'm not even a novelty account. I just pick relevant names.

WHAT'S THAT? GOVERNMENT IS BAD? I TOTALLY AGREE.
