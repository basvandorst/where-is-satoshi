China is currently fucking the market with currency manipulation
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:46:12
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:02:13
Hong Kong might actually burn if China starts a crackdown
@_date: 2019-10-22 10:53:21
Gonna have to disagree there
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:06:46
Coke destroys lives because it’s expensive 
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:02:52
I mean isn’t that the goal because then it’s a stable currency
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:58:59
No that’s not common knowledge so I’m asking you to prove your claims... if we were having a debate about if stars were real I would expect you to have proof they were and I would have to have proof they weren’t
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:07:47
You mean convents right? Which usually do a lot of charity work in the areas they’re built
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:39:43
What fact did I state that was incorrect
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:17:49
You think it’s 50%? Holy shit that’s delusional
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:53:55
The only reason it hasn’t gone to court is because he hid in the embassy until the statute of limitations expired
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:05:07
If it reaches 4K after an ATH that is a massive red flag that you can’t ignore 
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:36:28
No this isn’t a “go google it bro” you made the claim you back it up with facts otherwise your statement is bullshit... burden of proof is on who makes the claim not on the person calling their bullshit
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:48:51
No being a POS makes you a bad guy
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:06:25
A shitbag human deserves your support just because he invested in a currency you like?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:19:30
I just stated facts... sorry if facts are stupid to you
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:11:59
Let’s see, only released the Hillary emails, crushed damning information about republicans, raped someone, worked with Roger Stone to subvert democracy. Oh and was a shit houseguest in the embassy refusing to clean up after himself and his cat
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:59:35
Fine... allegedly raped someone... happy?
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:33:57
Got a source for that statement? Because I don’t really trust you after saying 50% of reported rapes are false

The DNC is a private organization and can appoint whoever the fuck they want to run for President

The church is donating a lot of money and resources to the rebuilding of the cathedral

I’m wishing him not great things because he’s a not great person
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:02:45
This thought process is how we get Alex Jones, flat earthers, and conspiracy theories
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:26:00
Besides being a jerk to the edcuadorian embassy, conspiring wto undermine democratic principles of a sovereign nation, and potentially raping someone, I can’t think of any other reasons
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:35:14
If the accuser admitted filing phony charges why is she asking Sweden to reopen the case and charges were only dropped because he hid in the embassy until the statute of limitations expired
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:57:25
Which part is fiction?
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:19:33
Is it not true he was rude to the Ecuadorian embassy? Is it not true that he undermined the election?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:25:51
Ok here you go 
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:04:31
Why can’t people help rebuild what is a cultural and historical landmark in their city? It’s a little more complex than DAE Catholic Church bad
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:08:17
What thinking critically is involved in those things? Those are facts. That’s like saying I don’t think critically because I know the earth is round or I get vaccinated

And it has many more inferior qualities such as stability (or lack thereof), requiring on there being technology, not having the backing of institutions with good credit ratings (seriously this is why currency like the dollar is actually valuable even though it’s paper, the US gives its word which makes value)

I wear my Citizen to the gym... I know it’s not a Rolex but it’s still a couple hundred dollars 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:06:18
That’s the thing... Bitcoin is never going to be a currency with these levels of fluctuation... it needs to stabilize and stay around a number for a while... 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:15:04
The currencies he mentioned are stable because those nations have credit to back them up 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:07:18
It’s gotta stabilize to be a viable currency... these wild swings are never going to be good
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:11:21
Short it? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:21:27
when it hit 20,000 I wanted to short bitcoin so damn hard... I just didnt have the funds to do it at the time
@_date: 2019-01-29 02:16:06
calling investing "gambling" is a shitty comparison. there are charts and data to help with investing
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:06:45
For Americans, this is like bragging that you bought a Chevy Malibu with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:05:19
I don’t think he could get that through Congress and seeing how it’s their job anyways they’re not gonna do it 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:46:03
Yeah but one has the credit backing of a secure nation who has a high credit rating and is tangible, the other is data on a computer 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:44:24
I really wish I had the cash to short it when it was at 20K... 
@_date: 2018-12-20 00:18:41
That’s not how laws work...
