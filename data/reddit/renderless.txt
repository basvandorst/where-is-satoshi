Highly volatile is an understatement. The Yen is volatile, and it has lost 30% of it's value in 6 months, Bitcoin did more than that in one day.

You also don't invest $16,000 in what "might" be a speculative bubble. You can invest some, but prudence is a good thing here.

There is no physical solution, but be wary. I don't know how old you are, but I remember when people were talking about lifestyle changes in the late 90's for stocks that are now worthless. I see a lot of that in this subreddit too. When everyone is excited in an investment you should be the one worried. Volatility is dangerous and no money manager worth his salt would risk a market with such huge swings. I hope BTC is successful, I REALLY do, but don't drink the kool-aid, it is still a financial decision. That alone should cause you to take notice, as most rational investors don't jump in so quickly like what we are seeing here.

There are many Forex platforms that offer practice accounts, it is the same thing basically but with traditional currency. There is also a ton of information out there on how to read charts in a huge number of ways. I recently started to do it full time and I have spent 1000's of hours learning and I still suck. But it is possible.

This will kill the banking system of Cyprus. No one will ever trust that banking system in the foreseeable future, no one will save any sizable amount of money in their vaults. This is why they imposed a one week moratorium on taking your money out, they are hoping for an orderly control to prevent a run on the banks. But I would bet my bottom dollar, that in a week there will be no wealthy depositors in that bank, not one. The worst is probably not over for Cyprus.

I understand all that, but volatility is still bad, no matter how you slice it. If all you want is to attract speculators fine (which I amone), but if not then you shouldn't be happy or OK with high volatility. You aren't going to change the outcome, but don't be blind to the implications. Don't let your emotions cloud what could be an economic indicator.

Warn people of the possible dangers, many adopters are young and don't realize that they are speculating, some very large amounts of time and money. I trade currency full time about 80 hours a week ( I am doing it as I type this), I understand currencies pretty well I would think. This is no different. The Yen has lost around 15-20% of it's value since June of last year, and that is crazy fast, how much has the BTC changed in a month let alone almost a year. [This graph is nuts]( and anyone that thinks otherwise is a fool who may part with his money. BE CAREFUL. You may not be trying to preach to people, but I have no qualms in telling people to watch out. I know how much money I lost when I first started trading, and many people don't realize that this is a scary place to be right now.
Edit: If I could short the BTC, I would.

What you are describing is called [slippage.]( It is not a good thing (sometimes it works in your favor), and bitcoin verification is very slow, adding to slippage costs.

BTC is a novel idea conceptually, but in practice it is not, it is basically a digital commodity. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:59:13
Not to rain on your parade. But more people are looking to short BTC, you will need to see stable growth over a long period of time before larger investors adopt BTC. As long as the chart for value [looks like this,](  no one will invest incredibly large amounts of money in it unless they are shorting it.

I'm sure they are still to stunned to even think about anything at the moment, let alone an AMA. If you were just robbed of 40k Euros, I doubt you would do this right after it happened, and this is ongoing.

I don't gamble. I use information to make decisions on the probability of future prices. It's not guess work, it's thousands of hours of dedication learning to read the market.

From someone who reads these charts all day, don't let him showing you these charts mislead you into a false sense of security.

In nominal terms as well, the actual real value is no where close to 40%.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:42:30
Works in theory, but in forex many will most certainly lose with this setup. First of all there is the spread and second there is slippage. So you start off behind the eight ball.

This is what we like to call resistance in the forex market, and you should be very careful and observant around areas of resistance.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:17:56
Large swings in value instill fear, fear is never a good thing in a currency. Currency needs to be stable and people need to be confident in its future purchasing power.

Four minute lag? Oh man the [slippage]( would fucking kill you!

Look dude, if you want to have a a currency, let people use it as a currency. It's your money, use it as you see fit and give it to whom you want.

Rising values of any currency is a good thing. A rapid up and down nature of that growth is a bad thing, especially for people that are skeptical.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:13:30
I do not think you know what volatility means. I expect there to be variance in the price that rises as the currency increases in value though. There is a difference good friend.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:24:13
I trade currency for a living, so I understand what you are saying, but you would be wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:16:14
Futures traders have a saying. "Eat like chickens, shit like elephants." Also, the one thing Keynes said I agree with was "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." There is no such thing as the EMH, sometimes speculative bubbles are just that. I am not saying this is the case, but I am saying one should be aware of the possibility.
Edit: Also, what information are they looking at? There is nothing in the chart that would give an indication of it's price in the future. No patterns exist on a scale that large, there are no previous levels of resistance. All that is, is a guess.
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:38:30
Yes, but then were talking about long term investments measured in weeks and months or years, not "day" trading. Day trading doesn't care about long term goals, it only asks if it is overbought or oversold now or in a shorter time frame.
