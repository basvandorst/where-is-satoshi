Libra is making BTC a talking point.  Have you noticed how many high up people have talked about BTC since the libra launch....  they are connected.  Libra claims to be a crypto and BTC is THE CRYPTO.  Like it or not.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:52:43
You serious??  They are a for profit company that gets 1 billion XRP released from escrow they can do whatever they want with it.  They just used XRP (other people money) to buy money gram for the ripple company (not XRP).  Not only that, they paid 4 times market rate to buy this stake in money gram.  It was a horrible investment but they don’t care.  They thought it would pump their coin and they didn’t even have to use their own funds....it’s pretty much the definition of a shit coin/ponzi scheme.  It goes against everything crypto.  People saying it’s “decentralized” don’t understand what decentralization truly is.  The ripple company can freeze anyone’s assets if they do choose. They have done it before and would do it again if they need to.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:31:28
And your wrong 100%.  It’s the big dogs that decide what happens in economics.  If the 100 richest people in America wanted to de risk their portfolios they could grind the economy to a hault overnight (happened during the Great Depression when there was massive wealth inequality). 100 average people decide to pull their money out of markets and the whales eat their lunch ��
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:07:36
Sorry buddy, I won’t be much help on that front.  I use Coinbase for my fiat on ramp.  I did use binance before they started being so sketchy and changing rules for Americans &amp; such.  Gotta get your coins off exchanges though.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:37:09
Ya all that needs to happen is ripple company wants to freeze and address and it will happen....it’s happened before and it wasn’t even an attack, it was a whale (founder) dumping his coins, then they froze his account.  It’s not decentralized....nobody, and I mean nobody, can stop a BTC transaction once it gets initiated.  That is decentralization.  It is the gold standard of decentralization.

But that doesn’t even factor in circulating supply.  So a coin could cost .1BTC but if it has 100X the supply then it’s actually 10 times larger of a network ($ wise) then BTC.....just sayin haha

If you get towards 1 BTC you need a hardware wallet for sure.  I’d recommend ledger or Trezor.  Not your keys, not your coins.

This is a silly question but I’ll give you a silly/obvious answer.  If you can only afford .01 BTC and your wondering how much USD $ you would have at a certain price you take your BTC * said price......AKA 100K$ per BTC * .01 BTC = 1000$

Exactly, I think in the future he’s laying out USD is obviously not the USD we see today.  It has most likely hyperinflated at least once , lost its world reserve currency status, and people probably measure the cost of goods in satoshi’s.  If he’s assuming no hyperinflation and USD is still world reserve currency, he’s trippin haha only time can tell.

Look Into cosmos network, or even stellar which is similar to ripple but more more decentralized.  Even BCH can output a decent number of transactions and it’s much more decentralized than ripple.  Ripple is hardy even a crypto IMO.

@_date: 2019-07-18 20:37:57
If he’s talking in terms of today’s buying power of a dollar..... no way.  But considering the death spiral USD is headed towards and would already be on if we didn’t have artificially low intrest rates, it’s possible.  Many fiat currencies in the past have exploded (technically they have all died  besides the ones alive today).  China is the most fucked.  They have had 9 different currency restarts in the last 100 years and their current currency is very very leveraged and would have exploded if their interest rates weren’t crazy low and they have huge capital restrictions and currency manipulation.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:49:31

5-6% is conservative....if used the same equations for the 80’s it would be 7%.  They have to constantly change the equation or the whole economy would blow up.  They would need to get 8% yields from government bonds.....our debt would enter a death spiral in a few years.

Deflationary recessions are economists worst nightmare.  They will drop interest rates to zero (or maybe negative), do multiple rounds of QE, &amp; any new/old trick in the book before they would let a deflationary recession/depression go down. They would rather print everyone’s money down to nothing
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:46:23
I don’t care if they make me disclose my BTC address (even if that’s not ideal) at least they can’t put a negative Intrest rate on my wallet and slowly steal from me while at the same time loaning my money to others...

@_date: 2019-11-27 17:03:16
So right before the last bull run??  Have you ever zoomed out?  Looked at the stock to flow vs BTC history??  You have a lot to learn buddy.  
Life is all about the long game.  If you don’t look at your investments over multi year graphs your doing it wrong.  3 years is absolutely nothing.  Most people talk about investments over 5-10-25 year time frames.  Becuase it’s all about being able to retire.  If you bought BTC 5-8 years ago you would already be retired ����
@_date: 2019-11-19 23:01:08
Such a dumb comment.   By the day every BTC is “lost” every human will most likely be lost also............

No not at all.  They are trying to get people to have faith in the value of a currency again.  Going back to the gold standard.  But at the end of the day your going to have to trust that the government holds as much gold as they say they do. &amp; eventually, as is human nature, they will get greedy and the insiders will receive more paper gold then real gold and will have to cut the amount of gold each note represents....and you have to trust the government they are even holding as much gold as they say they do in the first place...... the common thread is trust &amp; faith in a centralized authority ran by humans....im good on that, already been proven many times it doesn’t work. I’ll trust the computers.

There has never been a better place to store your money (over a 4 year time period) in history then BTC.  It will end up being the scarcest asset in the galaxy.

@_date: 2019-11-27 17:15:53
If you know about the long game and you’ve been building your portfolio for 25 years why are you only referencing BTC after the last bull run?! That’s just plain stupid.  10 years ago BTC was under a dollar, that’s a 750,000% return in 10 years...... name something even close in the last 10 years.  Just use 5 years ago, it was 200$, that’s a 3750% return, name something close over the last 5 years.  I agree past results don’t dictate future results but look at the stock to flow vs price over time.....it’s not a coincidence they line up almost perfectly.  
Good luck with your portfolio boomer ��

I disagree, smart bitcoiners feel that way.  Through every bull run you would been disappointed if you sold your BTC for a 5-10X gain in USD terms, you would have watched it fly way past that.  Especially when you start counting multiple runs.   USD is trash money (fiat).  Check
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:31:04
Idk, if we are looking at the same charts you must be blind.  The low or near low before the last bull run was 200$.  If you sold at 5-10X you would be sitting on 1-2K per BTC, you would have watched it 10X that.  And when you start looking at early bull runs or looking over multiple halvenings you really start to regret selling at 5-10X USD from your initial purchase.
Way to try and be smart though buddy, great effort ����
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:27:34
I think this is fairly legitimate.  For at least 90% of the population it doesn’t work as a “currency” in its current form.

Hmmm I wouldn’t say credit cards per say, retail investors &amp; tether would be the two main culprits IMO.   And the fast crash (besides overvaluation) has a lot to do with the CME opening it’s future contracts.  Those dudes have a lot of capital to play with and connections in very high places.  CME controls the price of many different assets and settle their contracts in FIAT so it’s not really a fair game.
Just to elaborate, they can open a short position of more BTC than even circulates and they can’t get caught with their pants down because they settle contracts i. Fiat.  That’s why BAKKT is so powerful, if someone tries to pull the same shit on BAKKT and get caught, they gotta find a lot of BTC fast, which mean price goes ⬆️

Ya once you realize this it’s powerful.  BTC &amp; Gold are both equity based &amp; are about ownership.  With that said there is much more paper gold than physical gold in the world, so just because you “own” gold doesn’t really mean you have gold......which is why BTC / crypto assets are ��

You are so clueless.....in so many ways.  
First, BTC is extremely liquid and can be exchanged for cash much easier than gold.  And getting it to its final location and having ownership is soooo much more simple and less costly.  
And your last point is completely retarded and shows you don’t know dick.  Warren buffet is sitting on a 125B $ cash pile as we speak, along with Apple at over 100B$.

Do you regret not buying BTC 10 years ago??  You should haha. And if you don’t your ignorant or can’t read charts haha
Monetary metals MC is almost entirely based on stock to flow ratio.  You can plot gold, next to silver, next to platinum, next to BTC and they all line up almost perfectly.  Google it and check yourself.  
Your last comment shows how clueless you are.  You can not replicate its stock to flow with anything.  Gold currently has the highest stock to flow with around 60, name another asset you could realistically get to that sort of stock to flow that is considered a collectible / rare asset.....I’ll be waiting.  BTC currently is somewhere in the silver range of stock to flow, and after its next halving will be below gold but not by much.  In 4.5 years, after the 4th halving, it will have the highest stock to flow the world has ever seen.
Search planb stock to flow if you want resources for what I’m talking about.

5M 2019 equivalent is much different than 5M, just like in the Weimar Republic 10 German marks = 1 oz of gold, and three years later 10 trillion German marks = 1 oz of gold.  I’m saying the money supply will hyper inflate along with the fact people will move to liquid non seizable stores of value as governments grasp for power.
Hard assets that are non inflatable will rise immensely while the thing we all measure the value of everything in (USD) Hyperinflates.  Market cap of BTC could easily hit 100 trillion USD in this situation. While have a value of 1-10 trillion in today’s value.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:56:43
I don’t really agree with your point.  They will do everything possible to not give up their power and let their Ponzi scheme break.  So inevitably, they will hyper inflate the currency using MMT as justification and continue QE infinity.  When they start losing power governments will move towards confiscation by direct means or large taxation increases on assets such as property.  At the end of the day liquidity will flock to something like BTC &amp;/or other decentralized crypto’s. 
I’m not a BTC maximalist but the logic works out to have some sort of hyper-bitcoinisation.    Look up the Weimar Republic and see what happened to their currency compared to a hard asset like gold.  Goes from 10 per oz of gold to 10 trillion per ounce of gold over the course of a few years.
Thing like this happen gradually then suddenly, and even this “gradually” thing for BTC hasn’t been all that gradual, but at the end of the day only .1-.5% of the world even understands this shit......

Yes and that’s why I think BTC is the corner stone of crypto (MC shows that obviously) &amp; why it will eventually be the ultimate collateral.  I just don’t really like the direction it’s headed at the moment.

This is very good advice.  I also think many altcoins will outpace BTC, but your safest bet by far (still with very high returns) would be 100% BTC.  
As you learn more you can trade some of your sats in for some alt coins.  But there is a very high chance some of those sats will be wasted buying a �� coin......

Huge fees on layer one.  And the need for trusted 3rd parties (watch towers) on lightning.  The fact to open and close a lightning channel requires a layer one transaction, which will be expensive as hell at this rate and lead to everyone keeping their money on lightning.  Liquid is super centralized and as shown on the pic above, is the centerpiece of their suite.
I should mention, they can fix the need for watch towers but they would also need to solve the routing problem, which scientist have been working on for a longgggg time with no luck.  And if you look at the problem it’s virtually impossible to solve with our current understanding of networks.

Around the Great Depression everyone lost faith in the USD And started going out and buying gold.  United States and then made buying and holding gold illegal, very similar to what’s going on in Venezuela right now with BTC.  Why are they not going out and buying gold?  Because in the modern day economy, gold would never work,  Digital gold(BTC) is the best way to store &amp; exchange value currently.

I sooooo much disagree with this.  The thing. That gives gold most of its value is its stock to flow ratio.  The fact it’s shiny,pretty, &amp; a good conductor only gives is a fraction of its value.  And just to prove it, if somehow we could master asteroid mining we could get, in today’s value, 700 Quintillion $ worth of gold, now would this exponentially increase the GDP of the world, obviously not.  It will exponentially decrease the stock to flow of gold and therefore destroy its store of value and utility.  
With BTC, number one it’s impossible to change the stock to flow from the scheduled S/F, and many of  golds best characteristics BTC is either better or equivalent on....  so moral of the story is I disagree with how you think on this and only time can tell who’s right.  If the past 10 years says anything, your gonna regret your decision / thought process.

Bitcoin is disinflationary, the total supply is always increasing (until 2140ish) but the amount it’s increasing by is decreasing AKA (supply curve has a negative slope....but with BTC it’s pretty much a step function decreases (once every four years the amount of BTC produced every day gets cut in half).
The math works out so In the four year period after the halvening, there will be more BTC produced then in the rest of history after those 4 years.....
AKA first four years of BTC’s existence there was more bitcoin created than the rest of time
After that.....crazy shit.

B) no one knows the best or perfect time to buy.  It’s all about DCA (dollar cost averaging) over time and try to catch local dips if you can.  Cash app is a nice easy starting place for buying.
C) everything has speculation baked into it, bitcoin more than most though.  It’s a very complicated beast takes a long time and a lot of reading.  There are some alts with potential to but your best bet is to just buy BTC for now and later you can use it to buy into any alt.

Look into block sizes, segwit, lighting as the go to scaling solution, etc.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:27:43
It has to do with BTC in general and how to get the number of transactions up while staying user friendly, affordable, &amp; inclusive.  If only rich people can use layer one that seems kind of off to me.....especially when you look how BTC was advertised in its early days when it blew up.
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:03:30
Lights are flashing red....they are trying to get ahold of as many BTC as possible
Edit: just withdrew mine yesterday, good timing ��. Remember, not your keys, not your coins.  JAN 3rd proof of keys!
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:23:28
Idk what your watching but the FED is needing to force feed liquidty into the REPO market so it doesn’t blow up......something is happening that’s big and will need QE reallll fast
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:22:16
Hmmm....good question.  I’d say the mod team for sure but I think it may start from the top also.  I don’t think the average bitcoin person agrees with censorship (obviously, it’s a key part of bitcoin) but they also aren’t cool with you disagreeing with BTC’s direction.  You let the people at the top steer the ship and be happy haha
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:45:44
What??  That was the slogan of BTC all during its beginning??  Cheap transactions anywhere in the world.....
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:33:57
I would prefer many cheap transactions to very few extremely expensive transactions.  I mean, that was what BTC advertised during the majority of its run.  Only recently has it become more of a store of value than currency.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:41:20
It can never be priced in becuase 99.9% of people don’t give a single fuck or know anything about bitcoin.....and bitcoins supply schedule doesn’t give two fucks....simply economics that you can’t price it in.
@_date: 2019-04-06 01:02:17
And if someone made a fast cheap fork of bitcoin would you accept it??  Or are you a maximalist?
But I do agree with everything you said for the most part.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:00:01
Classic BTC maximalist reply, ignore any grain of truth and just say TROLLLL.  How about you tell me how BTC will avoid these problems instead of just closing your eyes.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:56:05
Want to elaborate on the points I made?  If BTC does blow up how expensive do you think a transaction will be?  I’d say 50$ is just a drop in the bucket, we saw that already.  You do know fees are priced in BTC so if BTC price 10X’s and transactions fees in sats stays the same, we’re already looking at 20$.
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:26:34
The way bitcoin is dealing with its scaling issues and trying to advance its capabilities.  And with every step there are people debating on both sides but often one sided logic is ridiculed and not accepted....
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:56:06
There were many good responses within here, yours is mediocre at best.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:14:50
So in this future does nobody use the first layer so the fees are extremely small or do only the elite/wealthy have access to the first layer?  And if the former and almost all transactions are done on 2nd &amp; 3rd layers, what happens when block rewards get halved to almost zero and there is no money in mining becuase all transactions occur off the first layer?  PS I own a decent amount of BTC but I’m always looking for potential Pitfalls in all my crypto’s and ways to look ahead and stop problems before they occur.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:47:58
Hub and spoke style?  With massive super nodes?  Average people will only be able to afford to close channels a couple times a month maybe??  Starting to sound like a dystopian crypto future ��. I’d say having a usable first layer would be a good starting point ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:31:58
They have a ton of xlm set aside to give to people.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:29:14
You don’t think BTC transactions will be important.....why you here bro?
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:38:09
That’s the beauty of BTC, if you don’t like what the main group is doing you can fork off and make your own version you think improves on it but still has Bitcoin at its core.  So it may break apart what we know as BTC (even that is highly doubtful) but Bitcoin won’t die, it may just take a new form.  So it’s a tricky question.
And none of this would be a problem if bitcoin was scaleable, but it’s not and lightning network may fix it but it also may not.....
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:38:18
And fractional reserve lets them loan out your deposits and doesn’t NEED to give you anything back, but some do.
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:48:08
It’s just stupid, there will never be a day that every last satoshi is lost unless there are no people left to use them.  Or a massive solar flare goes off and ruins all electronics, but it would have to be a 24hr storm to get the whole world.  But it wouldn’t be from sats being lost year over year, it would be them all being lost at once.
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:15:55
In this sub I recommend going with the flow.  If you try to bring up new ideas or question the current direction of BTC you will get kicked....I may even get kicked for this.  There is a lot of censorship within r/bitcoin.  BTC itself is the OG crypto and won’t lose its crown unless they really mess up.
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:29:18
Good response, thanks!
@_date: 2019-12-20 06:20:46
What your looking for is something like auger.  ￼
@_date: 2019-04-23 18:11:21
So user friendly ��
Def the future of payments.....NOT ��
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:50:47
Opposite actually, people doing fractional reserve will scramble for real BTC
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:08:56
You sound very desperate and you need that money,  rule of crypto, only put in money you can lose.  If BTC ends up tanking (not saying it will) you would have to find 11K instead of 5....but you do you boo boo ����
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:44:45
Great reply, thanks.  We need more of this in this sub, not just Lamborghini memes and circle jerks.  I think you are right on many fronts here.
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:04:06
The problem is you need to do this, that’s fucked up haha
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:44:33
Instead you would just be charged fees every time you used it, unless you used lightning that is.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:08:50
I appreciate a true response and not deflection, I also appreciate pointing out the problems with continuing to increase block size to meet TX demand.  But you still don’t see a future with 100$+ transaction fees being a problem and a reality?  It hit 60ish during 2017 and that’s with only .01% of the world even buying crypto.  If BTC price got towards 100-250K and a bull run spikes up the meme pool like crazy, we could be looking at 500$+ fees easy.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:45:39
Devaluation of fiat currencies and hard assets resilience to this throughout history ( store of values including gold &amp; real estate over the long term).
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:54:36
But what’s the alternative?  Holding cash??  My fairly good salary could buy 4 gallons of milk every two weeks (after tax) if I just hold USD.  If every 2 weeks I switch to BTC and hold, by salary could by 50 gallons of milk......48 plus some cereal actually ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:12:51
It hasn’t gotten bad enough for them to do some serious shit to stop it, QE and even lower interest  rates will be coming.  Race to zero my friend.
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:43:43
 That was my thought I’ve also never heard of a ten word seed phrase
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:26:21
Definilty BTC, If your not rolling in cash. BCH &amp; especially BSV are much more speculative plays.  If you have a bunch of money and you don’t mind losing a fat chunk of it, I’d go 70% BTC (minimum), 29% BCH, &amp; 1% BSV (considering you will probably lose all of that) ��
Or you could go 90-95% BTC, 5-10% BCH, that’s a nice risk reward.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:05:35
Of course, I agree during a recession BTC won’t kill it.  But what I’m saying is, the fed won’t let a true recession happen.  They can’t.  If stocks and housing (American household net worth as a % of GDP) went back to historically Normal or even low % the whole game would blow up.  We are In the everything bubble and the fed will do everything in its power to not let it deflate.....and honestly, I think they will succeed.  In $ terms it’s 100% possible to stop recessions.  Unfortunately, they are going to cause everyone to lose faith in fiat.  This is how I see it playing out.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:18:23
We’re all just guessing.  I think that QE was a experiment gone wrong (but was necessary) in the system we have built you can’t have all the assets deflating 30-50%, the whole thing will blow up.  Only time can tell ��
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:39:56
A script to hack In?   Good luck ����
I’m sure it could be done but do you have the time and computing power to waste?  With a quantum computer you could probably get it done fast ;)
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:31:22
If your seed phrase doesn’t work....your pretty much sunk.  Sorry dude.
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:40:12
What your not putting together (even though this article points to it) the new goal of the fed (adding to 2% inflation &amp; employment %’s) is to keep business cycles going as long as possible.  Which at the end of a prolonged business cycle that starts deflating, would be mass amounts of monetary stimulus and easing of rates.  BTC is gonna kill it no matter what they do at this point....fiat is fucked
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:57:03
The thing is, they will never let this economic bubble deflate....they can’t.  They will drop rates negative, lower reserved requirements, do mass amounts of QE, and maybe even come up with some new shit ��.  They will kill fiat before they let economy crash.
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:41:58
Supply chain management, smart contracts, and many other use cases.  Also I think lighting network will be 18 months out for the next 10 years ����. When was the first time lighting was 18 months out?  3 years ago? Haha
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:15:45
Lastly I’m sure I have more BTC than you and I’m a big fan, so fuck off dummy
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:07:41
It’s ok, I can’t speak any other languages.  But try to be a little nicer, it can take you a long way.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:42:34
It will be an ecosystem, but I see BTC sitting at the top of it for at least 20 years, minimum.  It’s tokenomics are way to strong for another coin to take it over soon
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:40:05
Not true.  BTC isn’t perfect.  It’s slow AF and expensive.  It is very secure though.  But only one POW coin can be truly secure.  That’s why I think POW will fade over time and POS will take over.  Makes so much more sense on many fronts.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:35:21
No it will get higher, you need at least enough to open/close the channel.  So if transaction fees are 100$, you can guess what the minimum will be.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:22:46
Someone’s sad they didn’t buy at 4500 ;) you were probably one of those dudes predicting 2.2K or something ��. Good luck buv, at least your in the right place ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:29:08
You obviously don’t know shit about blockchains.  I’ll just let you stay ignorant.  Have a good one buddy ��. Also I don’t know shit about magic but it sounds like you have a big boner for it.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:14:06
Hahaha that’s a totally different question... what’s your problem bro?  I looked at your profile and it says your from a third world country and your English sucks...I understand now.  Enjoy your dirt house peasant ��
PS : it stands for point of sale, something BTC is not very good at having such high fees.
@_date: 2019-05-05 16:54:31
Have the payments rout ideally, it’s an incredibly hard thing to solve without having super nodes/preferred pathways.  If pathway selection is totally random it can be a shit show.  Hop to hop routing on an undiscovered map has yet to be solved.  And broadcasting what the map (current channel states) looks like doesn’t work becuase it’s constantly being changed....
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:27:40
You could try to explain to them how USD is the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.  And the second biggest currency (Chinese) is easy to see as a Ponzi scheme.  You can reference 08 tax payer bail outs that went to massive bonuses for the bank top dogs.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:50:26
USD??  Ya I agree, Monopoly money soon ����
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:03:57
So that comment was supposed to show how smart you are.... �� ��. Good job buddy.
I’m not hoping for the next bitcoin, Bitcoin is bitcoin and will be king for the foreseeable future.  But even at BTC meet ups no one buys their beer/nachos with BTC.....cause you can’t.  Ya you can use lightning but nobody does for POS.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:15:59
Ok you just heard about BTC for the first time in America, how long does it take you to get some BTC?  My guess 5 days at the earliest.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:37:40
It is digital gold and will be king for a while, but there are some crypto’s that do things better than BTC &amp; do different things.  But as far as store of value, BTC is the gold standard/the king/ the bees knees/ whatever you want to call it.  It’s the best in its category, and kind of just owns the store of value category
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:25:35
No you claim your gains as capital gains, long or short term based upon time owned.  Just act as if BTC is a normal stock/asset.  Expect you can buy pizza with it, which is a bitch for taxes BTW ��
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:38:19
Didn’t know that, calm down bro ��. It would be smart to have these cards on the blockchain though.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:22:06
Hahahaha you do coke....almost guarantees your stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:29:42
I’m going to reverse this question, how much is a dollar worth and why?  How much is an ounce of gold worth and why?  How much is a sea side house worth and why? (A lot less soon from global warming ��)
Moral of the story is something is only worth how much someone is willing to give you for it, nothing more, nothing less.  And soon with hyperinflation (see Venezuela) fiat may look something. Like Monopoly money in 5-50 years.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:58:10
I’d say most people In the world can’t just buy multiple BTC, most people I know don’t have over 15K$ to throw around randomly ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:53:43
Ya for sure, it’s the best store of wealth no question.   I just think there will be many crypto’s that succeed and end up out preforming BTC long term from current price points, but SOOO MANY will fail, so your best bet is to just stack sats.  I do a ton of research and buy ALTS along with my BTC &amp; ETH stacks.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:09:44
I agree with most of what you said, but proof of stake can definitely be secure.  You will figure it out eventually.  Good luck buddy ��
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:53:14

What if you just tokenized all the cards so it would be as simple as sending an email sending a magic card across the world?  It could then be re printed at a local magic/card store or just be used straight up on a digital version of magic.  Just some thoughts
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:33:58
I agree with everything except a single strong currency, fuck that.  There will be many, BTC was a great starting point and has extreme staying power.  It will be king for a long time.  But there are many good different crypto’s that solve different problems.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:07:46
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:37:18
There are many, anyone who is a pure BTC maximalist is very short sighted IMO.  You really want to go to a world with only one currency?   That sounds like a distopian future of extreme haves and have nots.  I think the entire space will evolve and change over time, with BTC being king (by far) for the foreseeable future.  Not to mention it take 30-60 minutes and 1-60 dollars to make a transaction....that’s not great haha. And that 60 could turn into multiple hundreds of BTC price goes to the moon and the meme pool is stuffed full.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:49:32
It’s very arrogant to say no coin will ever take it over, I said MINIMUM of 20 years, that could mean 50 or 1000, but saying never is just dumb.  PS your English is horrible.

Do you know what POS means you monkey? ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:27:02
Hahaha you have mental problems bro. I own over 1 BTC.  Approaching 2.  And it is expensive AF, and the transaction fees are measured in sats so when BTC moons, so does the transaction fees.
