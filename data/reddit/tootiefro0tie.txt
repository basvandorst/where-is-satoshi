B b but John at the office

Lmao I can't believe anyone can defend the current fees and wait times with a straight face.

If you're panicking, you're in too deep. You didn't put money into this you can't live without, did you?

If enough people anticipate a trend then it won't happen. So basically .... maybe, maybe not. Argh!

The projection here is so strong I can almost taste it.

Bitcoin Cash isn't a scam. There's asshole troll behavior on both sides and they'll call one another a "scam" until the end of time.

You can buy on Coinbase without your bank transfer being completed yet, also you're buying/selling with Coinbase itself - on GDAX it's with other accounts, Coinbase is just providing the exchange.
Mostly I think it's just so they can scoop a bigger fee from unknowing/unsuspecting newbies who may never realize there's a cheaper alternative.

Fortunately bitcoin is no longer quite as fully gripped in the hands of crypto-internet-libertarians.

The network is under immense stress right now. Network transaction times and costs are bitcoin's Achilles heel. There's a solution in the works (Lightning Network) but it's not available yet.

Lmao wow

I don't really see how this matters unless you're a 110 year old who just woke up from a century-long coma? Inflation is low and is matched or exceeded by even very conservative investments.

Don't just assume everyone you disagree with is a "paid shill". More likely, they're BCH holders who will stand to benefit greatly if its price rises. Personally I think their arguments are decent but their attitude is a big turn-off.

Yeah I consider all the people associated with it to be scummy, but I prefer to judge it based on its technological merits and ability to be used.

"Wall Street" isn't one entity. All of those institutions can trade among themselves. If they have big enough reserves of bitcoin themselves they can dump them all at once and flood the market - though I don't think that would make much sense for them to do.

This place is a fucking cult. It's almost as bad as @_date: 2017-12-13 01:53:33
I don't think bitcoin is in any danger of "porting in" some new features. This old dinosaur is already getting lapped left and right.

What companies use crypto? Exchanges do, but we pay the fees, not them.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:55:01
Wonder if they’re even still really there. Probably already spent them for you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:58:12
Is this guy posting from two different accounts? Lol. Anyway wouldn't the fees eat up any arbitrage profit? Otherwise someone would already be doing it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:52:36
It can't split. It can, however, fork - but that's not quite the same thing.
Coinbase is easy but charges a very high fee. Do your homework, learn how bitcoins work and how to buy on an exchange. Look up GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:49:45
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:40:06
GDAX charges much lower fees. Also you can raise your Coinbase limit by verifying your identity.

Wall Street consists of many viciously competing entities, they're just as eager to fuck each other as they are to steal from the little man. They are indiscriminate. Which is good for us. Also the block chain is more transparent than a lot of more traditional markets.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:54:03
There's no store. There's an exchange, just like in the stock market or commodity markets. I'd start learning about basic market concepts, bid/ask spreads and how orders work.
