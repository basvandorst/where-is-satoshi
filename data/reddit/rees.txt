That's unfortunately just a chart error.  It will always drop for the most recent day and we're working on getting this fixed!

Was this started by the guy who bought 10,000 BTC for $50?

 for reference.

Best of luck to you!  We need tons of bright minds on board

Rees from Coinbase here, 
We hit our temporary site-wide buy limit a few minutes ago but have now applied a fix.  You should be able to create both kinds of orders if needed.
Please PM me if you experience any difficult and I'll certainly help!

This is actually a pretty fantastic interview, well spoken and informative. Nice job Jinyoung Lee Englund!

Make sure to use a different private key each time, otherwise it will be very easy to keep sweeping it!  (Wasn't me)

I've been wanting to gift out 0.1-0.01 denomination coins, but can't seem to find a reputable vendor with decent prices.  
Can anyone recommend one?  If not I'll probably just make my own.

I'm actually going to leave the burden of proof on you for this one.

Hi, Rees from Coinbase here.  I'm sorry for the trouble this has caused!  The error does appear reproducible, as typing "1NS" will cause the send money field to auto-suggest 1NSXoRoP8g2uGzUB8YjUKC9uC5ZWP5TH4i.  It looks to be referencing the entire blockchain address registry rather than just your account's history.  The fewer characters suggested, the more primitive the address appears.  
I can definitely understand how the auto-suggest may have caused a withdrawal error.  This is a matter that will be forwarded to our engineers so we can get it resolved as quickly as possible.  I'll be looking for your customer case in support as well!

Because of the universal nature of the bitcoin blockchain, a brainwallet itself can be pre-imported into a wallet.  If you chose to make a paper wallet using the word "password" then the private key and public address would be the same no matter who did this.  Transferring funds into this address would cause them to appear in anyone else's wallet that's also using the brainwallet.
Collisions are much more common here.  There are people building wallets with rainbow tables of billions of addresses.  Each is imported from an iterations of any possible word or phrase.  These are not as safe as a normal private key because humans are inherently bad with entropy.  
Ideally, a brainwallet should be generated from text that no human or machine could ever replicate, but this is hard to do unless you really know what you're doing.  The general recommendation to just avoid brainwallets in general.  
A password manager passphrase can be brute forced as well, but it becomes exponentially more difficult with complexity and each new character added.

For now it's possible to decrypt a password protected wallet at bitaddress.org under the "wallet details" tab. 
Weird, I thought blockchain.info had this functionailty
