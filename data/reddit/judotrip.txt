It's nothing like that.  The UFC is just a league for the sport of Mixed Martial Arts, which includes boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, judo, and basically everything else you can think of.
There are rules, though.  No biting, hair pulling, eye gouging, groin shots, and more.

Really?  You're going to slam a self-made guy who was first a competitive Quake player, then a TaeKwonDo and kickboxing champion, a Brazilian JiuJitsu black belt, a successful stand-up comedian and actor, a colorful and accurate commentator for the UFC, and the host of a wildly successful podcast?
I'd like to know what life experience you have that makes you feel so superior.  He might not be the smartest dude on Earth, but you don't accomplish all of that by being a dumbass.

The burden of proof is on you, as the claimant, to prove that's what actually happened.
It doesn't work the other way around.  "Santa Claus created Earth, prove me wrong" is not a compelling argument that Santa Claus actually created Earth.  Just because we don't have proof against your argument does not make your argument true, it just means you argued wrong.  You could actually be correct, but your argument is still wrong.

I made a single 1BTC transaction about an hour ago, and it's still unconfirmed.
I'm brand new to Bitcoin, should I be worried?  Should I just chill out and wait?
edit:  Also, I don't know if it matters, but I'm not running a bitcoin desktop client.  I simply moved my BTC from one online wallet to another.  Does the lack of client matter?

..but, I still don't see what they can really do.  Short of shutting the internet off, or trying to get ISPs to block websites that deal with Bitcoin (both completely extreme hypotheticals), what are they going to do?
I don't see them making it illegal to buy or sell Bitcoins, and even if they did, people could just switch to another kind of digital currency.  Look at how much revenue floats around in video game gold and credits.
Yes, the Fed might try to muck things up, maybe.  But, I question how effective they can really be.

Right.  I guess I worded it poorly.
Either way, the fact is that this used to be an option, but no longer is.  I think my research was justified and accurate.

yup, sure.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:02:35
I think that's quite a long way off.  Most people are still going to **want** to use the Dollar (or Euro or whatever their currency is), because it's ingrained in us and it's familiar.
Bitcoin may be exploding, and that's great for us, but there is still quite a long while to go before a significant portion of the population are making transactions with them for everyday use.

In theory, anyone can create physical Bitcoins, right?  They may not be of the solid craftsmanship that Casascius provides... but I'm pretty sure I could even turn an old Pog into a Bitcoin.
I think there's a whole potential market JUST in physical novelty/vanity coins.

You could have BTC tips attached to Likes, even.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:33:12
I think you can simply print out a QR code and set it out with your goods.  Customers can send BTC to your wallet from the QR code, and you can verify the transactions on your mobile phone.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:36:38
Don't fear monger.
I had a 4-5 hour turn around on a transaction yesterday, but the BTC eventually arrived.  MtGox is under extreme load right now with all the new users, so just be patient.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:25:48
Or it could be that the utility of the Bitcoin is just being understood by more people, and the $20 price was massively undervalue.

Does it typically take hours to confirm a transaction, or is the lag due to the craziness of BTC today?

Did you miss the article posted here, that makes the point that a legal service is handling more BTC than an illegal one?  This is only good news, I don't know what you're on about with the Silk Road.
So people can use Bitcoins to buy drugs.  So what?  They also use dollars and euros to buy drugs.  No one questions the legitimacy or usefulness of paper money just because you can do illegal things with them.

@_date: 2013-04-10 11:18:02
Because usually the resistance is high on symbolic highs like 100, 150, 200, etc.  Once that wall goes down, it's common that the price continues to go up for a bit.
So they're just betting that $250 will be a new low at which they can buy, before selling at a higher price.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:48:34

No, Mt.Gox follows the buyers and sellers on their market.  They do not set the price, the users do.  Mt.Gox simply facilitates the trade.
Next you will tell me that Mt.Gox manipulates the prices, but you won't have any proof, of course.

I received 1 Bitcoin in 2011, it was worth $5.  It is now worth ~$90, while my USDollars don't grow at all.
I can easily send people bitcoins with no fees.  I can keep bitcoins safe offline.  I can trade them and try to profit.  I can gamble on world happenings.  I can tip Redditors with them.
I can feel somewhat safer about my money while I see others having hundreds of thousands stolen from their bank accounts, with no end in sight.  I can have money and not feel guilty about funding any large banking institutions.
Also, it's kinda cool.
