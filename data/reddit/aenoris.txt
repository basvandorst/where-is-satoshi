In the international stage i don´t know,i tryed in first place with BTC-E but even if this exchange don´t require a validation process you need credit/debit card to fund your account. In my particular case, I could use the local argentinean exchange Unisend.com because i think that they maybe did an exception when they aprobed my account validation request plus that the exchange accepts deposits in cash trought "Rapipago".

Yes,before every buy that i did i studied the bitcoin price chart and the ecosystem,for that task i learned a bit of technical analisis  but as many others  at this moment i´m in red. (i need a btc in 340, but im optimistic)
My plan is to hold my btc savings at least 1 or 2 decades and then think in my next move.
I use the bitcoin Q.T Software wallet for savings and the blockchain.info wallet as my future pocket. (All my bitcoins are in my savings wallet)

I´m a huge fanatic of this new technology and its potential to change the world, i decided to act acording to my believes and my rationality, i have the 90% of my life savings in bitcoin and the other 10% in Ethereum.
Edit: I´m completely aware of the risk of my actions but i´m decided to continue following this path.

In my closest circles of "face to face " friends I don´t know bitcoiners excepting of the few that i personally brought to bitcoin, neither in my family. In 2013 i started alone my journey without near influences to the bitcoin ecosystem after reading an article in Taringa ! about bitcoins .
Edit: Through the facebook group " Bitcoin Argentina " I met a lot of bitcoiners.

Yes, i asked to a few merchants if they accepted bitcoins,but they response was not only negative but also with a high lack of interest,i think that this will change with the time.

Thanks!,yes in Argentina we have some BTM principally installed near the country capital (Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires) in bitcoin community meeting places like the restaurant "Anti-domingo".

Im using a bicoin QT wallet installed in an old notbook with linux backed with a paper wallet.Yes, I understand the basic concepts of security, my email,exchange, exchange accounts have 2factor and the notbook is used exclusively for hold the bitcoins.
Edit: Any sugestion is welcomed!

I bought my first bitcoins face to face in December 2013, I continued buying all the 2014 in unisend.com (exchange) and ripio.com (broker).
Buy bitcoins in Argentina is relatively easy if you know the basic of bitcoin and where to buy, in the last year a big amount of brokers and exchanges has opened to the public here and in latin america in general facilitating the process,anyway for the new user the validation process of the exchanges (specially for the young) and the high fees of many brokers are a problem to solve if we want to increase the adoption plus the lack of knowledge of possible new users about the bitcoin community here in argentina. In the end,for the new Argentinean user is ten times more easy and secure to buy bitcoins now than in 2013.
