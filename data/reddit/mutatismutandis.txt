some of those passwords are just disappointing.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:15:24

It would fit the timeline. 
I wonder if then is this just for the lulz or if this is a tactic for something more devious.

I think it may not be a precipitous drop. I expect it will be a series of mad fluctuation of the prices before it eventually settles. I think this will happen because of the automated buy/sell options in MtGox. It will ratchet down probably around 10 and then swing back up to the 20s and back down to the 10s again and then back up to 20s and so on for a bit and then ultimately settle at a price around 9-12, afterwards a huge rally will occur that will shoot it back up to the high 20s.
Of course this assumes that mtgox will come back online...it's been offline for about 2 hours now...

that's not the most recent db of all of the usernames and passwords, i think it's been out for a while, I know this because my account is not listed, i made my account, ironically, earlier today. thus either that's an old db or the people releasing the db didn't have access to all of the data.

I think it's fair that they are rolling back the transactions.
I don't think anyone is paying(or having to compensate) for anything, since under normal circumstances this wouldn't happen. It's one thing if the owner choses to dump 261k coins for $0.01, it's another thing entirely when they are robbed and that occurs. What's unfair and amoral is to mount an argument supporting theft. Essentially you are by your own argument saying it's ok to accept stolen goods because someone didn't do everything possible to make their account ultra secure, it does not absolve you of moral responsibility. It's not ok to knowingly accept stolen goods.
It does not scare me, this would occur in any exchange if someone did something like this.

I feel bad for anyone who had money in the exchange. I was about to start making trades today. I think I will just do the prudent thing; change my password to my email (just in case) and wait for the dust to settle.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:58:08
I registered earlier today before the crash and I fully expected my info to be in this list, but it's not. 
So either:
1)MtGox.com has been hacked for a while, since my data is not in there
2) this isn't the full list of users.
either way, very strange.

flawed logic is flawed.
@_date: 2011-06-12 20:57:55
Maybe someone is consolidating their coins into one account.

Part of the market price is derived from the stability of the exchange being used to process all of the transactions. The exchange is providing the service of being an intermediary between parties interested in exchanging btc for usd (or the converse). Implicit in that service is that a user can remove or add their currency ad hoc, thus giving assurance that they will not be inadvertently locked out of making money. Thus once it is know that the exchange is unstable and that you cannot directly maximize your transaction at any given time, you would not likely keep your funds in that exchange and would look for a more reliable service. SOOOOO...since MtGox currently has the highest ratio price for btc to usd there will be a sale off so that people can move their funds into another exchange or get out of dealing with btc altogether. They could of course simply remove their funds from the MtGox exchange, but that could potentially require the customer to take a loss larger than trying to sale the coins right out of the gate when the exchange comes back online. 
The rational choice is to do nothing, however, a vast majority of people don't think rationally when money is involved.

curious. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:56:36
what is odd to me is that i registered just today and my email and username are not in that list. This means to me at least that the db out in the wild is old and mtgox has been hacked for at least a day or this isn't a complete list.
@_date: 2011-06-19 00:33:24
use -k phatk

My statement is pure speculation, but it's based on the assumption that uncertainty in an exchange or a market breeds fear among investors.
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:13:20
If you don't mind, I'll follow your lead and take that approach as well.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:09:34
cool thanks for the info, then mtgox has been compromised for some time now. Scary.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:46:25
my guess, there is going to be a shitload of people selling 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:00:01
I want to pop her bubble. /wink
@_date: 2013-03-06 14:51:44
I like the way you think.

No doubt, on one hand I think it's pretty awesome his asic was faulty, so that he can give us a play by play of how Avalon handles this kind of issue.
