Do you think that USD isn't backed primarily by drugs and porn or something?

Unless Coinbase is already planning on stealing tons of BTC and setting this dude up as a scapegoat.

I don't follow bitcoin closely anymore, and barely read this sub, but how is this not a currency?
I can trade an amount of BTC from my wallet to another entity for goods or services. It is not a good or service, so it's a medium of value, therefore it's currency.
Has there been some debate recently about this topic?

Initially I was thinking about the same, but I wouldn't be surprised to see as high as $5k. I'm more interested in what it's going to drop to - I don't think it will drop that far.

Bitcoin has only had one significant bubble since it became somewhat widespread. And since people are more conscious of it I don't think we'll see that kind of surge again. I think it might 5x this time, and not quite pop.
No one really knows though, if it's 10x a month from now I'll be too busy yelling about the moon to remember this comment.

I actually did read the article. I didn't say it's good, I said it's not fake news - which it isn't.

ITT: People not reading dates.
This article is not fake news, it's from 1 year ago when BTC was at around $220 and had been downtrending for months after the bubble.

I've been using BTCe for years. Should probably get my coins outta there.

Eh, think I only had .01 left there anyways, but you're right.

Inequality is inherent to everything, capitalism just accepts that fighting it is a losing battle.
