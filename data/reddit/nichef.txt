Well the authorities are another issue, that seems reasonable.

It's perfectly safe to store.

If gas is free right now and you think it will go up in price why don't you stockpile it and when the price goes up sell it at a discount to the government rate.  Then buy btc and wait for local fiat to inflate again, it's only a matter of time then voila free money times 2.  You got yourself quite the opportunity right there.

Or the liquid sidechain which is currently larger than LN, LN may eventually overtake it but liquid from my understanding is doing a lot of transactions.

Did you miss the part of life where you don't talk to people like an asshole?  I think that is the rule you need to look into.  I was adding context to a comment, nothing for you to jump on someone's shit over just to show how intelligent you are.
The fiduciary rule you refer to was just enacted and wouldn't preclude the comment regarding if it was possible to hold bitcoin in a 401k 6 years ago.  Also, there is no determination that it isn't allowed because most of the prohibited transactions are classified under self dealing and real estate ownership.  Some people have concluded that, that excludes bitcoin because the IRS treats bitcoin as property but there are no explicit rules governing the ownership of Bitcoin in a 401k, this has lead some to suspect that the DOL will provide further guidance, but that remains to be seen.
You see the IRS and DOL govern different aspects of ERISA and they have conflicting guidance.  So in short no, no I didn't miss the changes to the fiduciary rules made by the DOL.

You're actually trading a contract that is worth 1 USD of BTC at the time of purchase.  The price is tied to the average of bitcoin's spot price on a few different exchanges but it isn't actual bitcoin it is a contract based on bitcoin's value.  Because the price is tied to the constant price in these other markets where actual bitcoin is traded it is called a swap because the price of the contract and the real price of bitcoin are interchangeable.  
There is also something called a future which is a market where the participants are guessing about the price at some later time.  This is a promise to buy or sell bitcoin at an agreed upon date.  So if most of the participants think that the price of bitcoin will be lower than its current price on the agreed upon date then the price in those markets will be lower and vice versa.  This spread between the current price and the futures price is something people also trade without ever seeing the future settlement, in fact that is what most people do they trade the change in the spread.
The swaps market is generally larger than the futures market, in the case of Bitmex, but they are both derivatives because they derive their value on the price of bitcoin but aren't actually bitcoin.

The volume and transactions aren't published to prevent front running.  Most of the large exchanges (like Bitmex, Bitfinex and OKex), trading desks and market makers use it though.  It's a sidechain just like lightning is a sidechain but it isn't used by retail so a lot of people don't think about it as a result.  
Also as far as your question you would be correct, there is most likely an increase in use that isn't being represented by traditional metrics.  For instance NVT is metric that everyone likes to throw around, but Willy Woo the guy who created it has said that he doesn't think that it really has as much value anymore because of the unknown volume that liquid has removed.  His chart for NVT even has an indication for when liquid started.

It's also not adding liquid volume in which is a huge amount of transaction volume between most exchanges, brokers and market makers.  That used to be a substantial portion of the on chain transactions, now that has been removed from layer one yoy comparisons are almost worthless.

If you run a self directed 401k you have been able to buy bitcoin with Kingdom Trust as the custodian for years.  I am not sure when they started but it has been a long time.
