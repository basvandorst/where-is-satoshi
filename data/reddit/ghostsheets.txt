They are so backed up. Hundreds of thousands of users have joined their service. They can't vet that many accounts reasonably. I believe the messages you are seeing are being displayed intentionally to deter verifications until they can get above water again.

A lot of people are closing their coinbase and gdax accounts after what happened yesterday. Totally unacceptable.

So by that metaphor. Bitcoin could be the aol.com of the .com boom and spawn thousands of other .com companies like it, but get left in the dust. Or it could be the Google of the .com bubble and continue to just rise and rise.

Adjust your buy automation pricepoint each week so when it hits a certain value beneath where it was when you setup the automation, it handles everything for you.

Hence the birth of the hedge fund niche. Absolutely agreed. Spread em out. But that's more a combination of intelligence based on history, world markets, with some probability included. 
Crypto investing is so different. It's totally alien.

There were very few people who estimated it would go up as much as it did. Now that everyone else is trying to ride the gravy train all we have is mass speculation. Unless you're a whale coordinating with others no one knows what BTC is going to do in the markets.

That isn't how this works. That isn't how any of this works.

And yes. Those fees are normal right now. It's an problem with certain exchanges that has everyone frustrated.

Because in 2013 and 2014 you could buy a BTC for dollars. Now one BTC is/was 18k/14k. People are only able to buy a fraction of BTC. 
The people that bought in in 13/14 saw their value swell enormously. People who bought in at 18/14 saw their value tank.

They are calling it a bubble because it's speculative investing based on someone saying, "do you think they'll pay more?"

The problem is, no one is really an authority on what's happening right now. Except the big biiiiiig players controlling the market. Everyone else is guessing, hoping, etc. There has never been a market like this before so there is no historical data to compare to and report on. When people state something with apparent conviction, they're guessing. 
I used to work for Ray Dalio. One of the greatest minds in investing. He says it's a bubble. He's someone I'll seek out info on for bitcoin.

The fact that HODL has become such a catch-phrase around here is obnoxious in itself. The fact that someone can't even tell someone to hold their position while just typing the word like it's meant to be spelled is obnoxious. Yeah we all get it, it's got some roots in BTC. Yeah we get it it's funny. Bunch of fucking reddit hive-mind band wagoners. Annoying as fuck. 
It just goes to show the type of people lurking around here these days. Mainstream media has brought a lot of investment wannabes out of the woodwork. 
If anyone says you should hold or sell, ignore them. Do what your gut tells you. It's your money and BTC can't be forecasted like the cash markets can. Bunch of fucking dorks around here. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:34:37
The money in my bank account isn't really money. It's just a number in a database. 
The fed downplaying BTC is exactly what should continue to drive BTC higher.

Even if the fee was large, he would have had at least pennies worth of bitcoin show in his account.

They're not taxing BTC. They're taxing your USD. 
You don't really believe in BTC. You're just using it to get at USD which is what most people are doing right now. Close your BoA account and use BTC exclusively.

You could have just as easily put 1000 into bad stocks on the NYSE and lost it. Doesn't matter what your intentions are or who sold it to you. This is the volatility of trading any amount of money on any platform. 
I hope you realize sooner than later that you should probably start working overtime to earn that 1K back. 
Sorry for the tough advice.

Except a lot more $$$ is lost on a 30% downfall from 19K BTC as opposed to 10K lol. Come on man.

It's possible but safe to assume they're gone unless you have some other way of remembering/recovering your ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:26:44
Can you afford to lose hundreds?
If yes, then it may be worth it to invest. 
Just one month ago, someone who invested 100, now has 200 or 250. If that was 500, they'd have 1000, or 1500. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:25:16
Absolutely. Or if you're in this for a quick buck and not so much a "believer", then invest in alt coins. XRP is going to explode. Get in low while you can.

Go to Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; iTunes &amp; App Store.
Tap your Apple ID, then tap View Apple ID. You might be asked to authenticate your Apple ID.
If you use Family Sharing, you'll see in your purchase history what you bought using your Apple ID, but you won't see what other family members bought. To see what other family members bought, sign in with their Apple ID.
Scroll to Purchase History and tap it.
You can then change the date range by clicking on 90-Days. 
And go back to see your app download history for as long as you've had your apple ID. 
It will show downloads even for free apps.

There will always be a better and faster car. 
Bitcoin was the first to the show so I think they're running far ahead for that very reason. So the question isn't really will there be. It's when, will they be trust worthy, will they be pump and dump, if they are better how will user adoption go?, etc. etc. etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:19:29
What has changed is that Wallstreet, Hedgefunds and the likes are now involved or wanting to be involved. And they have WAAAY more money than early adopters did. Those guys want to control the economy of BTC. And they most likely will at some point. 
That's just mho though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:25:13
Dude. It's called speculation for a reason. NO ONE KNOWS.

Those coins or the fractions of them are still out there, in the ether.  Just think of it as a dollar that falls into the sewer and is never seen again. It's still there and it's still part of the total printed money count, it just doesn't belong to anyone. Doesn't hurt anyone, doesn't help anyone. It's kind of just benign. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:28:29
That's not entirely true with lost potential for financial gains. A good lawyer could argue that had his coins not been stolen he'd have made (this much) off of them today. The burden would be proving that he would have infact held onto them until it's at today's value. Which is probably impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:50:38
Any investor, who invested a year ago, watched his investment surpass 2K, then go all the way to 19K, then back down to 2K where he then decides to attempt to collect a profit is not an investor. He's an idiot.

Was it racist when you could buy a bitcoin for less than a dollar per coin? O_o

Surely. Everyone here likely gets that. But the guy is asking for help. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:45:58
I've been seeing lots of posts like this. Losing money on a tanking stock on the NYSE is one thing. Especially if that 5K is putting you in a risk of ruin situation. Getting money caught up in a potentially fraudulent transaction and having the middleman ignore you is entirely different. I'm really tired of this apathetic attitude. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:19:14
You just commented in another thread with this very response. Did it really need it's own thread? There's a lot of noise building up in this sub and it's hard to have regular discussions of any magnitude when most of the time spent here is scrolling through random threads. 
Sorry for the harsh response.

I agree man. Get it while you can if you can afford it. Some day it may be as valuable and as finite as gold. But right now it's got some growing pains to go through. Everyone is just guessing as to what happens next. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:40:02
This is a dumb comment. If he'd lost it via a sharp drop off, then I'm assuming he'd be fine with that. But it's an issue with the transaction. I mean, come on.

Don't any of you see what happened? BTC got a lot of mainstream attention. It's been pumped and dumped. It will never be pumped up that significantly again, because a lot of people have probably become wary of throwing their money at BTC at this point. Pumped. Dumped. 
Those who believe in the tech can continue to "believe", but it will never get anywhere near 20K again. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:25:03
Look into alt coints. Much cheaper to get in. More for your money. LTC. ETH. XRP. 
I'd highly recommend throwing about 1K at XRP right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:10:06
