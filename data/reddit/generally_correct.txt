Your first credit union was pretty shitty to be honest.  The one I'm at has always had an app, super easy to get a loan, and doesn't charge any fees.  I don't think you can throw out "Credit Unions are a mixed bag" based on just your experience.

Exactly what I was thinking.  Definitely another form of DRM.

How do you keep them offline if you're just using an exchange?  Sorry for the noob question. Haven't bought any bitcoin yet and trying to do my research.

The one where people buy a ton of cool stuff with Bitcoin! Overstock.com.... uh... drugs and shady stuff... my illegal video streaming site...
Hmm.... guess there's not really an ecosystem.

lol, you don't think bitcoin is manipulated?

So what's the catalyst this time?  Enlighten me.

WTF. I've now read this same thought 4 times in this thread alone.  Is everybody that's involved in Bitcoin also regulars over at Zerohedge or something?  What's up with this mindset that there's a huge economic crash coming soon?

Or you could, you know, invest in something that has a higher probability of giving you a positive return and enjoy the ride with less risk and actually make money.
I've been on the sidelines for months with bitcoin because I don't fully understand it.  I've allocated my money to go toward index funds and I'm up 13% YTD.  Not huge gains like everybody seems to be looking for, but I'll take it over losing my shirt.

You might want to do a little more reading on what the Fed is actually doing. The money is NOT being circulated into the economy. Inflation would be skyrocketing if it was.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:11:55
So you didn't do any reading I see...

Meh.  Bitcoin still resembles movements that are typical of penny stocks.  Losing more than 50% of its value in a 24 hour time period does not make this a 'solid' investment going forward.  
Factor in the lack of reliable exchanges to buy/sell when things are bad/good and you've got a **very** risky investment here.
Plus, I'm not sure what Bitcoin and its community is trying to accomplish.  Bitcoin is supposed to be a *currency* but it's not an efficient market if everyone is trying to hoard it.

I guess you and I simply define fun in a different way then.  If you think watching charts and numbers go up and down is fun, more power to you.
