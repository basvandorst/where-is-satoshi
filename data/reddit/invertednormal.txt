What do you consider a low-fee transaction?
Edit:  Standard fee is .00001 isn't it?  Is that "low"?
@_date: 2015-06-20 02:44:29
Ok, sure.  But either decision is an experiment which involves people.  Doing nothing is still a decision.  Which decision prevents the theorized prediction of a bottlenecked transaction network? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:39:23
31 bits, 19 bits, 17 bits
Seems like it varies.
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:26:14
But blocks will organically grow to that size unless there is some unlikely, yet unforeseen, issue.  Blocks will not immediately be a full 8MB, just in the same way not all blocks today are a full 1MB or 750KB (soft limit) even when they potentially could be.  I think this issue is being greatly exaggerated and misunderstood even by the smartest people.
Yes, most of the miners.  And yes, miners do have a decision whether to run the new version.  That's the true consensus.
This update is all about prevention--prevention from the network not being able to scale with demand and perform tomorrow as it does today.  We don't pay high fees for transactions today, and payments are fast.  Will it be the same if the limit isn't raised?  No.  So which is the greater change to the network?
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:14:53
For the immediate future it does, while other scaling solutions are worked on.  If we want maximum adoption, the network has to support that.  If people can't use bitcoin as a reliable currency due to major confirmation latency, it will not be adopted in this way.  Think about what you're saying.  You're basically saying it doesn't matter if bitcoin ends up being a more and more expensive means of transacting like all the legacy systems that bitcoin was meant to address.  This is antithetical to what we all want I believe.  A block size increase is an immediate and warranted change to address a potentially immediate problem with little risk.  The fee will be greater and greater the more transactions pile up because people will have to compete with fees to get them through.  This kills the idea of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:52:52
This is a usability nightmare.  People will have to monitor their payments instead of just sending and forgetting.  This is retarded.

Isn't the current proposal to include 8MB blocks after most miners have decided they can handle &gt;1MB blocks?
I really don't understand the persistent, willful ignorance of those supposedly partaking in this debate.  I'm just a bystander, but it doesn't all seem to be that big of a deal.  The way Gavin is currently writing the code, the blocks won't increase in size until most of them are running the new version, And it's past a certain date, And the first miner to make a &gt;1MB block does so.  Those conditions seem pretty fair and safe.  But your comments convey that you haven't heard this proposal before...

Please explain how it has the potential to damage the bitcoin ecosystem more. In three years it will still be below the one-off 20MB proposal at 16MB.  There's time to adjust.

@_date: 2015-06-17 12:50:10
Mike, in the recent LTB episode said in paraphrase, there are no proposals ready for practical use that have been field tested and that would be less of a change than the block size increase proposal.  If the other potential counter-proposals aren't production ready, then what is the point of proposing them?  There is no point.
In the past, before a tx fee limit was in place, there was no hard block size limit other than that imposed by the constraints of the internet... so a 'potential' block size &gt;30MB has already been field tested and used in production.
People keep forgetting that the actual sizes of blocks will not likely magically become full, 20MB blocks instantly.  Block size will be able to organically grow with demand up to 20MB.  Full 20MB blocks will not be instantaneous, and will likely be quite gradual.  This is a desired thing, opening up the network to growth, allowing time for other proposals to be tested and implemented if needed.
Edit: And in that episode referenced, Mike was very calm and level headed and objective.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:53:29
You can't force an increase.  A majority has to voluntarily adopt it.  The consensus is in the community now, not in the code submissions.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:15:27
I've read probably most of the best arguments against the increase and haven't seen anything substantial.  What is the biggest trade-off in your opinion?
I think some of the most condemning statements addressing some of these trade-offs come from Satoshi himself years before the current debate started mostly positioned around the risks of centralization.
edit: did the tip work?  I don't see the usual changetip response
@_date: 2015-06-20 01:02:53
It's science.  Make an observation (1MB blocks may be too small to scale Bitcoin to a larger economy). Make a prediction and devise a test (there should be a backlog of transactions considering a 1MB block size and a scaled up number of transactions).  Perform the test and see if the test results match the prediction.  If a scaled up number of transactions caused a backlog of transactions, 1MB blocks are confirmed to be too small.  The same test can be initiated to test the prediction with 8-20MB blocks on the testnet.
These people are doing the science to prove what some of us logically predict.

Cool, thanks.  I don't think competition resulting in higher fees per transaction because transaction space is limited is a healthy way to grow the network.  I think the competition should be in the revenue from including as many standard fee-bearing transactions as possible.  The biggest possible block is what is required to do this.  8MB is a nice compromise for now to get us to the next step\debate.

But how do you measure its usefulness?  By how much it's used?  That equals adoption.
I'm not worried.  I'm sure some branch of it will be adopted... and it will be the one with the most usefulness\how much use it can support\how many transactions it can process.

The acceptance of changes made to the software is not centralized, even if coding changes were to be.  The software has to be adopted by those running the network (solving blocks) to affect the network.  The people running and using the network are globally decentralized, and individually incentivized to honestly compete for blocks to gain the reward.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:34:29
This won't affect peer-to-peer transactions.  Those regulations and 3rd parties are only relevant when legacy systems must be interfaced with.

If I had several addresses with BIP38 encryption all using the same password, I wouldn't want to decrypt the keys on an online device anyway (for fear of key logging).

@_date: 2014-07-15 16:18:56
Yes.  bitaddress.org
Download the source HTML from github linked to on the front page of bitaddress.org.
Run this HTML on an offline computer.  Generate some encrypted key pairs (private/public) using the BIP38 feature using a single password to generate them in bulk.  Store the BIP 38 keys in a spreadsheet and/or print some paper wallets.  Encrypt the spreadsheet and keep many copies of it in many locations.  In the future, refer to the spreadsheet on an offline computer and decrypt only the keys you wish to spend from.  Only decrypt on an offline machine (since you're using the same password for all BIP38 encrypted keys).  This way, your private keys and password are never exposed to the internet, and you can import keys only when you need the funds associated with them.  Send unspent funds back to an remaining or unused address previously generated.
Make sure to test sending small amounts to each address generated before sending large amounts.

What good is it to be able to monitor every transaction if potentially you don't know the identities (or intent) behind the transactions?  This is a possibility since Bitcoin is opensource and stealth technologies can be built around it.  If it's a government plan... then it wasn't a well thought out plan.
Another, the "eventualities" Bitcoin has faced and will face are still being discovered... so they weren't all thought out.  It is and will remain an evolving econosystem.

Right.  So it makes perfect sense.  I was equating money = value (as it does).  So the same value (money) will be represented by less of the currency (bitcoin).  So instead of more whole units of currency (bitcoin) being created to become generated in coinbase transactions, which will then need to be circulated from the top down, whole bitcoins will be subdivided futher if needed and simultaneously enrich all current bitcoin holders instead of just those generating the currency (like the FED does now.)

I don't disagree with the first sentence.  For the second... it's not (B)itcoin that will be under scrutiny, it will be those who use it for 'illicit' purposes.  Bitcoin is to individuals what spoons are individuals; i.e. It's just a tool.  Some will use the spoon and get fat, most will use it to eat moderately.  We shouldn't regulate the use of spoons because some choose to use them frivolously.  You can't save people from themselves (the attempt fails and a tyranny is created).

Yes, if you have the private key and don't show it to anybody.
Edit: In fact, I would strongly recommend you have all private keys secretly backed up multiple times in various locations.  If you BIP38 encrypt your private keys with a strong, yet memorable, password, you can be a little less paranoid about where you safely keep them.
Edit 2:  I stopped working with wallet.dat files and started generating my own BIP38 encrypted keys on an offline computer with bitaddress.org HTML source code, putting the encrypted keys in a password protected spreadsheet and distributed the file to various places and trusted people.  I figure if I am going to manage a file, why manage a wallet.dat file when I can just have my own generated keys in a more accessible place in a format I understand and can import into any wallet app...

This is not true.  A public key is exposed the first time you send bitcoin to it.  The exposure of the public key is not the concern at any point.

Maybe I'm being hard-headed and getting hung up on semantics, and maybe you're right in the big picture; but, I'm thinking in terms of cold storage.  You can't have a public key which hasn't been exposed if you've sent funds to it.  Sure, you can generate key pairs offline all day that will never be exposed (by not being used), but they'll also never be used as "storage" unless you send funds to the associated public address.

@_date: 2015-07-14 23:14:48
If block size was big enough, a fee was required, and transaction(s) were required in blocks, spam would not be a problem at all.  First, the block size would deter spammers because it would cost them too much to fill a block with even minimal fees for any extended period of time.

Apologies if I've caused you to inflict damage to your face.  I mean, what is the immediate thing we need a solution to?  The potential for a backlog of transactions in a growing network, right?  The immediate , lone solution is indeed to increase the limit while other scaling measures have time to develop.  We have to remember the limit was a temporary solution to an issue that is no longer a problem (spamming dust transactions).

I believe XT is the only compiled implementation available with the bigger blocks option, so they'll either support XT or compile their own Core with the option when the network starts to diverge, or they won't.  Somebody is going to attempt to make a &gt;1MB block as soon as technically possible, and if 75% is on board then everybody else will know what to do to not get left behind... and we'll see from there what implementation they use.  it does't really matter; bigger blocks are coming and that is consensus... people deciding for themselves.  nobody has anybody at the end of their barrel.

Yeah, or avoid a fee market with larger blocks/more tx\s
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:40:13
yeah, there are plenty of retailers you can pay with applepay or google wallet, etc, i'm sure... and if somebody uses the same brand-name bank, you can often make p2p payments to them without cash; however, there are still so many limitations beside just having to be members of the same bank or finding participating retailers.  payments aren't borderless and may often be restricted state-by-state (if un US), the new credit is not verified and available within ten minutes most often, the payments mechanism may be platform dependent (apple\android), payments are not even pseudonymous at best, on and on....

@_date: 2015-07-17 16:51:02
no, you're overthinking this a bit... and that's ok;  it seems more complex than it is.  the math problem the miners are solving is almost completely arbitrary.  the only considerable determining factor of the difficulty is how fast these random puzzles are being solved so the network can produce the next difficulty level which will average 10 minutes to solve.  difficulty is adjusted every so many blocks, which averages about every two weeks i think.  the included transactions in a block, including the coinbase (block reward), do not contribute to the mining difficulty.  miners validate TXs, ensuring they are well formed and meet protocol, and then begin to build their block with or without TXs.
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:26:58
i disagree... cash is inconvenient to get for those with direct deposit.  you have to hope there is a bank or ATM owned by your bank nearby.  if an ATM is near but not owned by your bank, the withdraw or deposit has a ridiculous fee from both your bank and other bank... sometimes the entire cost of a starbucks coffee.  my banks branches are dwindling... and that's BoA.

that part of Bitcoin needs to be fixed.  there should only be standard fees imo, based on the data size of the tx.

It proves that it is relatively inexpensive for a determined source to flood small blocks and create a backlog discouraging new or unaware users form transacting.  Larger blocks would be more prohibitively expensive to fill; although, this should not be the only deterrent.  Right now it's a tester flooding the network... but in enough time it will be legitimate TXs flooding the network and a backlog will accrue until users determine it is not worth the expense to transact on the bitcoin network.

Definitely.  You said it much better.  I do think there should be fees to incentive miners, of course, but I don't think the market for them should arise from a technical decision to artificially handicap the network's natural abilities.  And if it comes down to a competitive fee market, miners should be competing for larger numbers of transactions per block with standard fees as opposed to smaller numbers of TXs with much larger fees; that would dis-incentivize wider use of bitcoin.

Apologies, I don't understand what you're getting at.  I just think miners, as part of their duty for earning the block reward incentive, should be required to include some number of transactions in their blocks.  Mining empty blocks should not be possible.  What does it matter if it's specific transactions?  Miners already filter for specific transactions containing more substantial fees.  I'm not asking they include specific TXs, just that they include some number of any valid TXs.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:24:33

@_date: 2015-07-15 17:24:29
If a miner's mempool has no valid transactions to be chosen from, something else entirely is wrong.  Propogation doesn't take that long, so if in approx. ten minutes a miner doesn't have a single valid TX available to include in their block, then they need to not be mining or they need to investigate a deeper issue.  There are plenty of valid transactions taking place, so there is really no excuse other than greed.  The protocol needs to require blocks to include TXs.
Maybe there's something I don't understand about it, and ultimately there are enough miners including TXs to not be too concerned about it.
What is your opinion?
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:53:57
ah-hahahaha!  good stuff
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:08:51
Interesting.  I don't understand the part about having to raise the fee, also.  Cost for the miners is determined more by hash rate than by how many transactions they include in a block.  it would seem if miners were interested in maximizing earned fees, they would try to include as many TXs as possible that have a fee at all.  If I want to send somebody 25¢, i don't think i should be expected to include a 5¢ fee.  what do you think?
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:30:11
That wasn't my question, plus my question was kind of rhetorical.  I'm confident I know what will happen; there will be a competition of fees and regular users will leave and no longer attempt to transact.

Gavin and Mike  are trying to avoid disruption of bitcoin transaction service by increasing capacity of the network.  Don't quite understand how you could say otherwise, unless you've just been indoctrinated by the propaganda on another subreddit.

They didn't say "large block", they said "a block that is too big".
Too big is too big  ;)
I think the XT\B101 schedule is ideal.  No argument from me  =)
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:43:48
A block too large would not propogate faster than a less large block, and therefore would lose to the longest chain.
@_date: 2015-09-07 14:13:46
That's what she said.
No, but seriously, eventually I don't think it will matter too much how big blocks are, because major optimizations will mean entire blocks won't need to be sent... just the header and some optimized or compressed form of its contents.  We may not make it to the end of the BIP101 schedule before we realize the block size isn't going to matter.  But I'm in full support of BIP101 until we reach that point.  Room to grow means avoiding disaster.
@_date: 2015-09-07 02:31:47
exactly. 
Too big is too big
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:48:02
Don't confuse max possible size with practical size.  Just because it's allowed doesn't mean they will be that size.  Relax.

I'm sorry, could you repeat that?  Adam Back... Block stream... BIP101 infringing on their business model... something or other...

Are we talking about the same thing?  Dude above wanted to equate XT with the intentions of the stress test.  That doesn't follow. I was stating the difference.

I misread and thought you had created multiple phrases.
The recovery phrase is created when you launch breadWallet for the first time (if you delete the app and redownload, you get a new recovery phrase... unless you restore from a previous phrase), so if you wrote down the phrase from your old phone corresponding to the keys holding your 8BTC balance and restored that phrase verbatim in breadWallet on your new phone then your balance is still there (if it isn't showing, using the "rescan blockchain" button).
Make sure autocorrect didn't 'correct' any words from your phrase.  Assuming that you use iCloud backup and that breadWallet was selected for backup, your wallet should have been intact from a restore during setup from iCloud.
EDIT: Just saw that you did a rescan and it worked.  Congrats!!  Back up that phrase in multiple secure places.

I'm in Arkansas, and there's not too much BTC activity here apart from me.  My wife and I use it, but she roles her eyes when I talk about it.  My co-workers are tired of hearing about it, too, even though I've been talking to them about it since it was in the 130$ range.
I'm long bitcoin, and I won't shut up about it  ;)

It would be very commendable if you were to do so.  I've just never heard of GPL/etc. software also being patented... but I don't pay much attention, either.
Please redesign the Gyft mobile app interface.  I find it to be too flashy and buggy.  Reference the eGifter mobile app (apologies for the reference to the competition.)

Don't care for all the talk about pending patents.  If you're a fan of Bitcoin and want to see it succeed, take after companies like Bitpay that open source improvements to the ecosystem.
This does sound really exciting and innovative, though.

Sent them a support email to this effect.  Lighthouse is new, February 9 is already here, and their project isn't that well advertised.  I suggested they extend these Lighthouse projects closer to expected target dates for its incremental coding completion.

I don't understand what you mean by hacking the lost coins?  If they could be retrieved by hacking then the cryptography of Bitcoin would be broken and you could also steal "unlost" coins as well and the value of the network and its security would go to zero.  This is not going to happen.  Bitcoin will just have to become more divisible if needed.

True this
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:39:48
Yeah, that's about right.
It could also mean finding a way to do a reverse hash on the public keys, since public keys with a balance are known.  This would be astronomically more probable than guessing private keys.

I'm not a salesman, so I don't have any valid suggestions for good advertising.  I think the main concern this time was the infancy of Lighthouse and the short time-frame of the fundraiser... not necessarily poor advertising itself.  The project may just need more fundraising time.  I'm sorry I didn't realize that progress had halted until completion of a successful funding campaign.  The DarkWallet project had a 1BTC goal and no funding completion date.  Perhaps your team could break up the project into even smaller increments than originally planned and ask for smaller donations over longer periods of time.  This is all new to everybody, so I think your initial goal was a little too ambitious.  Baby steps for now.
Good luck.  Will donate more on my lunch break  ;)

You have to restore two HD wallet types/structures from your mnemonic: Default and Internal.  Default will restore the initial keys, and Internal will restore subsequent keys.
