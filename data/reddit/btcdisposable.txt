Very nice work. I'll be using this for sure!
Did youtube user "Julian Uy" actually claim the 0.1btc 2 weeks ago as he claims?

I think the main point of the holographic sticker is to act as a psychological security barrier, not as 100% tamper or fraud proof protection. Also as Mr Becker points out on his website, a paper wallet should be treated as you would treat cash. Keep it safe and secure.

What part of Australia? It's a big place! Western Australia is well worth a visit and I'd be happy to give you some travel ideas and line up some accom for btc. There's quite a few Canadians living here in Perth actually:)

You missed the cliche about how every animal in Australia kills you.

It's the same scenario with any investment (although at their core, bitcoin aren't an investment per se) Limited market &amp; large demand = increased price
@_date: 2013-05-11 13:27:39
hahahaha:) choice comment bru!

What? No, this was not helpful. Sounds like SR isn't doing you any favours either.
@_date: 2013-04-26 07:45:29
Meh. I don't see your point and I'm not arguing. Also I don't care. Good day sir.

You know what would be cool... A template that fits a standard photo print size, like 6"x4" for example. Maybe that way it could be done without any cutting involved. Load the printer with cheap, thin photo paper, print, fold, stick, and done!

Buy low, sell high. Keep that to yourself though.

nah, I sent him an email and he added it.

tl;dr You sound like an optimistic person. But whiney, really whiney. Also sounds like you're wrapping yourself in cotton wool, rocking back and forth, and telling yourself you didn't just get bitten.

thanks comboy!

Whilst I tend to agree with you (use the search engine people!!!) I think we should also try and be as helpful as we can with new potential bitcoin user questions. New adopters will eventually make your coins worth more money :) 
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:34:55
Ah I see. Good call :)
Funny how the first reaction of some people is "how can I break into that?" But then again, I guess that is the key to good product development...

I think you'll find that one of the lines is the median trade price, and the other is either a simple or exponential moving average. Without spending time on it, I can't tell you which is which.
 This chart (in AUD,  )
allows you to play with such values.

As a fellow Australian, I agree completely. Well said.
