mate buying the dips in November felt way better even better than the run because thats anxiety about when to cash out. the best feeling is knowing the wave was coming and buying the lows. your second bear market is not as fun... cherish your first bear.. its the best place to be.

In my opinion this is just to push us down on the daily and manage to hit that line so the whales can swoop up the krill

@_date: 2018-03-13 09:07:34
bullshit, actively encourage it, the more you help this amazing thing, i wish someone did with me. You miss the part where you just say don't invest what you cant afford to lose.

Blood from the drains at Vatican City. A new bull market has been chosen!

Man I’ve been trying to get my head around this. It’s way harder than anything I’ve understood in crypto.
10 guys bought a painting, they walked away with no painting and spent $1,000,000 on some tokens 
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:48:15
