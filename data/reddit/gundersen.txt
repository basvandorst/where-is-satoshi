Each hop will produce some delay, right? Since each node needs to react and do somethings to forward the payment to the next node. So it's best to route the payment via only one or two always-on nodes, since an offline node can't react until its back online, right? So this means you are unlikely to route the payment via your friends or acquaintances, and more likely to route it via large nodes with lots of liquidity? So to me it sounds like this will lead to a hub-and-spoke network with some really large hubs (think banks) in the center. That doesn't sound very decentralized?

Did you buy bitcoins because they are valuable today or because they are going to be more valuable tomorrow? If you said yes to the latter then you are creating a bubble.

I completely agree with you, I just don't want to use the word instant :)

Anyone who has lived abroad for a few years will tell you that it takes quite a while to think in a new currency. You have to use the new currency everyday and for many different things to get an intuitive sense of what something is worth in the new currency. Until you do, you have to mentally calculate how much something is worth in a more familiar currency, and then decide whether it is above or below what you think it is worth. In my experience it takes half a year of everyday use until I'm thinking in the new currency (and when I go back home I now have to go through the same process again). 
My point is that until you spend bitcoins,and only bitcoins, every day, you will not convert dollars into bitcoins, not until half a year after you start paying for everything in bitcoins

Agreed, which is why it would be interesting to compare the global hash rate over time with Moore's prediction

A bug report should include three things:
* What does it do?
* What should it have done?
* How do you reproduce it?
If any of these are missing the bug report is, unfortunately, useless.

Like I said, it is fast, but not instant. We are all used to a world of instant messaging, where a message can be sent to anyone in the world in a few seconds. That is instant. Bitcoins, as you said, take a few minutes to clear. That is faster than credit card, but slower than cash. So it is not instant. And as I said, my biggest surprise with spending bitcoins was that it wasn't as instant as I had heard. Therefore I believe it would be best if we stopped saying that it is instant, and instead claim that it is very quick.

You are assuming the collective hash rate is steady, which it is not. His hash rate is gong to stay the same, but the global hash rate is increasing, so his percentage output will decrease

I'm talking out of my own experience, and I didn't experience bitcoin transactions as instant, I had to wait almost half an hour before it was really transferred. And while I waited I was confused about whether I had done things correctly.
You can't decide what people will compare Bitcoin against. Just because you choose not to compare it to cash doesn't mean others wont. By cherry picking what you compare bitcoin against you are the one moving the goal post. 
The point here is that is going to talk about Bitcoin to people who has never heard about it before. Instead of claiming that it is instant (when compared to some other specific competitors) why not claim that it is fast, much faster than paypal?

The private key follows the address around the pig, just on the inside. If you cut open the pig without cutting into the address, then the private key will also be spared. In the next version I'll probably have an indicator of where to cut and I'll make the wall slightly thinner in that area.

As someone who has only a basic understanding of Bitcoins, why was the chain used by the (buggy) 0.7 version used instead of 0.8?
@_date: 2013-03-15 07:22:51
Moores Law; it will double every 18 months. It would be really interesting to see the history of hash rates and how it compares to Moores Law.

Could you zip over to Oslo; I need some bitcoins over here!

You should make ShutUpAndTakeMyBitcoins.com, a list of cool things to buy with bitcoins.

Converting bitcoins to dollars is simple, converting dollars to bank accounts is hard, so the dollars are still in the bitcoin market.
This means that all (or most) of the money that was in bitcoin is still in bitcoin. All of the value lost since the peak is still in the market, just on the other side of the (very thin) line separating bitcoins from dollars. This is not like the bank runs of market crashes, since people didn't cash out to get the money for something else. Everyone is still on the bank floor but nobody wants to go up to the tiller. 
Since it is unlikely that everyone has transferred their dollars back to their bank accounts they are just waiting for a reason to buy bitcoins. It is trivial to convert these dollars back into bitcoins, so the potential for another spike in value is huge, all they need is an incentive. As you said this could be a low enough price (less than 50?) but once this happens everyone needs to get into the same psychological state of mind, where they believe the value wont go any lower. Getting everyone to buy at the same time is harder than getting everyone to sell at the same time, so I'm curious about what could trigger this.
(this is of course speculation; I have no idea how many people have transferred their money out of mt.Gox, and only mt.Gox can answer that)

Borrowing money to buy something which will (for certain, everyone knows it!) be worth a lot more tomorrow is the best way to create a bubble. If the only reason you are buying something today is to cash in on the higher value in the future, then you are speculating, and when many people speculate you get a bubble. Raise your hand if you are willing to pay $50 for a bitcoin today because you are expecting it to be worth $100 in the near future? If you did this, then you are not saying that bitcoins are worth $50 today, you are claiming that bitcoins today are worth half of what they will be worth in the near future. If, tomorrow, the market agrees that a single bitcoin is only worth $30, then today they were actually worth $15, not $50. You gambled and you lost.
By borrowing money to buy bitcoins you are the one who is forcing the price up. The value isn't increasing because more people are spending bitcoins, they are increasing because more people are investing in bitcoins. Raise your hand if you have a wallet with some bitcoins which you will not spend, you are only waiting for it to be worth twice what you bought it for. What percentage of bitcoins have you saved, and what percentage have you spent? If you have saved 90% of the bitcoins you have bought, and everyone else has done this, then only 10% of the bitcoins bought are actually valuable, because only one tenth of the bitcoins out there are used for trade and are exchanged for goods and services. The moment people realize this, the value of bitcoins will drop to 10% of the value the day before. Have you saved 99% of the bitcoins you have bought? Bitcoins will be worth one percent of their apparent value. 
If you borrow money to buy bitcoins you are creating a bubble, and you will lose a lot of money, and you will have debt which you can't repay. Except this time you can't blame the evil bankers, because it is your own fault, and you are the one who created the bubble for everyone else.

As I mentioned in the post, you can one time pad the private key, which splits it in two, both parts are needed to get the original private key.

What surprised me the most the first time I spent bitcoins was that it was NOT instant, as I'd heard. It takes about 10 minutes to end up in a signed block chain, and about an hour for double spending to be completely impossible. My point is, don't say that bitcoin is instant, say that it is fast.

They should standardize a buy-this-address payment request, so you can buy an address with bitcoins.

**edit**: seriously, do you guys believe this? One person has observed this, no-one else can confirm it. There is no evidence, no screenshots and no news reports. This is a simple way anyone can manipulate the value of bitcoin with a simple text submission playing on the emotions of gullible people. Combine Sky, censorship, and bitcoin and you have a story that anyone will upvote! And then to stop others from pointing out that Sky isn't actually blocking bitcoin info you add an "Edit, seems to work now" at the end of the post.

The beauty of Bitcoin was that there was no need for certificates, a trusted third party or a shared secret. This is what made it different from everything else, and made it more secure than certificate based systems. Once a certificate based system is built on top of Bitcoin there is no need for the proof of work system that Bitcoin is built on. The certificate is the weakest link, and a payment system is only as strong as it's weakest link. With this, Bitcoin becomes no more safe than any other certificate payment system. 
There is actual no need for the bitcoin protocol to implement this proposal. Have a look at the [diagram]( on the proposal page. The weakest link is the communication between the wallet an the Merchant Server. If you replaced the communication with the Bitcoin P2P Network with a certificate communication with another Merchant Server, it would be just as safe as BIP70. 
Anyone can throw together such a system with readily available standards and software and claim that "[certificate technology] is the best we’ve got, it’s being improved via initiatives like cert transparency, and it has a track record of stopping worst case adversaries." This does not make it a good system for transferring money. It has all the flaws of current systems and no advantages.
