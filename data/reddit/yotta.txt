I was wondering if they'd fixed their API so that cloudflare doesn't screw it up. Guess not. Can anyone with an API key report whether that gets around it? The cloudflare bypass I wrote the last time it was turned on still works fine, at least.

No, they fucking didn't. They broke it up into product lines even after promising to give people the option to receive their purchased hash power as several smaller units.

The complaint about the certificate verification is a little silly, and I would not consider it a bug. I am less familiar with the Oauth2 stuff, so I won't comment on that other than to point out that Coinbase said they'd pay him a bounty if he made a working proof-of-concept attack.
He's claiming that Coinbase's SSL/TLS client implementation is insecure because, although it does full certificate chain and name verification (current standard practice), it does not also "pin" a specific certificate. If you "pin" a certificate, even a false certificate issued by a rouge/compromised certificate authority used by someone in a network position that would allow man-in-the-middle would not be accepted, however in practices this is *very* difficult to pull off, and there is a substantial risk of discovery of the attack. The groups that are able to pull off such attacks are generally government, and the FBI/NSA/whatever TLA we're pissed at this week can just get an NSL for whatever they want against Coinbase. There is also the issue that if you "pin" a certificate, you must update the app any time you need to update the certificate, which can be a pretty big pain in the ass.

There is no meaningful difference between 2^-160 (1/10^48) and 0. It is technically "possible" however it can be safely said that it never happen.
To do it other than by luck would require an efficient preimage attack on  ripemd160(sha256()) and a quantum computer that can solve the ecliptic curve discrete logarithm problem for 256 bit values - and the quantum computer won't help much with the preimage. Not happening any time soon.

you can do a try block on the blockchain to find the start of the address range, then walk the chain

You run bitcoin in "headless" mode, for me on Linux that's done as:
    bitcoind -server -daemon
then, you can run commands like:
    bitcoind getbalance
and it will return the balance, and you can send with
    bitcoind sendtoaddress 1XXXXXXXXXX 0.02
a list of the commands is available from
    bitcoind help

   bitcoind help signmessage

Trivial, but can only be done "bespoke" - generating them like this needs to be for a specific other public key.
This works because bitcoin keys are homomorphic with respect to addition, so you can compute public_key_1 + public_key_2 = public_key_3 and private_key_1 + private_key_2 = private key for public_key_3.

Some of your previous lottery drawings have been cheatable.  In particular, one of the first ones appeared to award the pot to the person who had their transaction ID match lottery picks mod 16 converted to hex.  It was six picks of 1-49. That made it so that one hex digit was more likely to show up than the others.
I'm fairly unsatisfied with your description of how the hashes are chosen.  Please provide pseudocode or actual code.
Draws need to be designed assuming that a cheater can manipulate both his transaction ID (which he can - there is a sequence number that can be manipulated as well as generating new addresses to use to change the hash) and as you said, manipulating the block hash (though manipulating the block hash is dramatically harder).
How I'd do it:
Ticket ID: We'll leave that as the transaction ID.
"The Draw": Use PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA-256 as the hash function, something like 100,000 iterations (in order to ensure that any attack would be obscenely expensive - this should take a couple minutes to run on a cpu), the hash of an announced in advance block number encoded as binary data as the salt, then as the data some lottery picks plus the closing values of a few large stock exchanges.
Picking the winner: most sequential bits matched starting from the left wins, break ties by numerically closest txid, if that ties (I'd be willing to stake anything that it won't ever tie), split the winnings.  The XORing thing suggested by wcoenen is equivalent to this.
I'd be happy to write you a script that does the proposed calculations.
This still isn't perfect, though if someone figured out how to cheat it they deserve the money for their efforts.

md5's preimage vulnerability only speeds up creating a collision by a factor of about 20, which is not a useful speedup because it'll still take several hundred years to attack the raw hash.
The collision attacks against md5 aren't of use for password stuff because they do not allow you to choose the resulting md5sum.
*unix* md5 isn't feasible to attack with rainbow tables.  It's also particularly annoying to brute force crack because it's an iterated hash which is designed to make it abnormally expensive to verify a password.  It's about 1000 times slower than raw md5, and the salts mean that you have to handle each user's password separately.

Moore's law won't last much longer. We are very close to the end of the road on how many transistors we can cram into a given amount of silicon. Currently we can do 14nm feature size on silicon. 5nm is probably as small as we can go in silicon. Maybe 1nm with other materials. After that there is no Moore's law. You might bring up biological computers or quantum computers, but Moore's law says *nothing* about *computing power*, only about how many *transistors* we can fit on a chip.

It's actually probably feasible over the course of a few years to generate two private keys that have the same Bitcoin address if you devote all the world's computing power to this task - you'll have to generate around 2^80 keys.

You can then either spend via the notary or wait until the lock time is expired and recover your coins if the notary vanishes.

1.6e+21 is too big to attack. log2(1.6e21) is ~2^70, and bitcoin wallets use key stretching to make cracking slow, so the security level is going to end up above 2^80, which is generally considered strong enough to make nation states give up.
But nobody's going to pick from a word list that large. A typical adult native speaker has a vocabulary that's maybe 10% of that, and if you ask them to "randomly" choose four words the choices will probably not be at all random.

That chart on the NSA's site does not say that 256 bit ECDSA results in a 128 bit symmetric key, it says that it is equivalent in strength to a 128 bit symmetric key.
RIPEMD160 has 2^80 strength for collision resistance, but bitcoin depends on it's strength against preimage attacks which is 2^160.

The best known non-quantum attack on 256 bit elliptic curve keys takes 2^128 "operations". Here "operations" is somewhat poorly defined, but I'm just going to handwave that for now - at most it makes these calculations off by a few orders of magnitude.
The bitcoin network currently performs about 2^52 hash256 operations per second. Imagine a trillion bitcoin networks. That would be about 2^92 operations per second. There are about 2^25 seconds in a year. This brings us to 2^117. Still not quite there. We need to keep this pace up for about 2000 years before we break the key.
All bets are off if someone builds a large enough quantum computer, though. Shor's algorithm can break elliptic curve keys, but I'm not sure how fast it runs or how big of a quantum computer would be needed.

That attack is impossible to pull off in practice - it requires hundreds of yottabytes (~2^88 blocks) of sample data to run, and even if you had that, 2^126 operations aren't any more feasible than 2^128. No sane cryptosystem keeps the same key for that much data.

When you send someone Bitcoin, it's actually like you're sending them a robot which has been [programmed with a set of conditions]( and a Swiss bank account number. Normally the robot is just programmed to verify that you've signed for the Bitcoin, but it can actually do a lot more.
One could tell the robot, for example, that there are three possible people who can sign for the Bitcoin but that two of them must sign for it together. Alice and Bob might use a robot like this because Alice wants to buy something expensive from Bob, but she doesn't trust him. Alice and Bob both trust Elliot's Escrow to be fair and neutral if they have a disagreement, so Alice has the robot look for signatures from herself, Bob and/or Elliot, requiring two of them to agree where the money is going. If all goes smoothly, Alice signs a note releasing the money and sends it to Bob, who can then spend the Bitcoin however he likes. If Alice is unhappy with how things go, she can ask Bob to refund her. Bob can either refund here by signing a note allowing here to spend the money or ask Elliot to decide who gets it. Elliot can sign a note allowing whoever he decides is right to spend the Bitcoin, with a small portion going to himself as payment for his services.
As another example, imagine that Frank lives in Townsville and wants to build a new playground. Frank says that it will cost fifty Bitcoins to build the playground. Alice, Bob, Elliot and a bunch of their friends all think the playground is a great idea, so they each program a robot to put some Bitcoin towards the project but only if when their Bitcoin is combined with Bitcoin from other robots there is enough to cover the whole bill. If not enough is sent by some deadline, Alice, Bob, Elliot and their friends can get their Bitcoin back, but if there are enough funds raised, Frank spends it to build the playground.
These two examples are both possible in Bitcoin today. In the future, as more of Bitcoin's programming language is tested, more complicated things will become possible.
**Edit:** Clarified crowd-funding example.

Two separate, independent issues.
1) You suggested creating a script that accept payouts only to a certain address - to the best of my knowledge, this isn't possible with bitcoin's current script operations because the script cannot inspect the outputs.
2) To the best of my knowledge, the way the network is currently set up, if you have enough hashing power to be reasonably sure you can create a block in time, you mine a block that spends the output that had a lock time before the 24 hours is up. I could be wrong about this, though.

A suitable 'magic' file which can identify the wallet file format would be needed, which I doubt it comes with. Wouldn't be too hard to add though.

Have you noticed that brainwallet.org no longer supports HTTPS?

*Assuming* it's generated randomly, you're far more likely to win the lottery several times in a row than to be bitten by an address collision.

As someone who ordered early on - I took a gamble. Also, as someone with engineering background, their excuses don't sound like bullshit. They *do* sound like the sorts of things that go on when people over-promise trying to do something new, and this does indicate inexperience. I knew this was a risk given their track record with FPGAs, though I hoped they'd learned from their mistakes.
As to why not just make scads of money mining for themselves - you'll note they are selling for USD amounts or the equivalent in BTC (which they seem to convert to USD). Selling hardware provides profit which is still substantial with less risk. There is a saying - in a gold rush those selling the shovels are the ones who get rich. It is in their interest to continue selling hardware, and if they pre-mine with it substantially, people will figure it out and there will be backlash.
Think about this. You want to capitalize on bitcoin mining. Which is the easier plan to convince a bank to give you a loan with or investors to give you money. "I'm going to build these machines that effectively print money (which may or may not be worth the cost of powering them by the time they're built) and use them to pay you back" vs "I'm going to build these machines that print money (which may or may not be worth the cost of powering them by the time they're built) and sell them to people - here's market research saying that we will be up to our ears in orders". One of these is far less risky than the other but still very lucrative. If you were an some random investor which would you be more likely to go for?
Now, I will say I still think there is a substantial chance that they will never ship what they promised, or ship my order so late that I can't profit. But I knew that going in. They also could pre-mine for a while, but then I, and others who ordered, can sue them since they promised not to.

A 'collision attack' is where someone is able to find two messages that hash to the same value, but they are not able to choose any particular value in advance, only that it will be the same. Being able to do that would allow one to create two different public keys with the same address, but this is of limited use since you don't get to pick what the address will be.
This is in contrast to a preimage attack where the attacker is able to create a message with a hash value of their choosing. If you wanted to try to create a public key matching an existing addresses, this is what you'd have to do, which is time complexity 2^159 on average.
Does that make sense?

I might be able to help. I have some experience with various forms of bitcoin key voodoo.

You seem to have some misunderstandings about the math involved. If you want to find a collision of a *particular* value for a 2^160 hash, that will take on average 2^159 attempts. You can find two things which hash to the same value with 2^80 attempts, but *you do not get to pick* what the hash will be.
I also dispute your claim that there are only 2^128 possible public keys - can you provide a citation? My understanding is that there is a 1-to-1 mapping, and that there are actually slightly less than 2^256 private keys possible (in a similar scheme called ed25519 there are 2^253 possible private keys).
The deal with RIPEMD160 is that the address is a hash of some public key, and it is, in theory, possible for more than one public key to map to the same bitcoin address. In practices the odds are so overwhelmingly against this that it is not worth worrying about, especially when you can just crack the public key with less work.

Smartphones often embed the location into the picture.

I actually didn't realize that you'd included balances and sorted them. I don't think a raw encoding would beat those rars in that case without a bit more work.
BTW, are you aware of vanitygen?

OS X is somewhat dangerous right now - in the past it has not been popular enough to be a worthwhile target, and now that that is changing the protection technologies are lagging.

This is what's going on here.
It only works in your browser because browsers cache intermediate certificates to be tolerant of incorrect installations like this.

They're not that much different, really. Bitcoin just has more crypto and "Are we sure that Scumbag Steve won't molest this algorithm?".

Those coins are probably gone forever - while that is formatted as a valid address you'd have to do a massive brute force search to find a private key that matches it.

You can read the source, or trust that other people who have read the source would throw an epic fit if it were doing badness.

There are know algorithms which are able to derive corresponding the private key from a known ECDSA public key with time complexity of 2^128 operations. ECDSA's security is based on the hardness of the
[discrete logarithm problem](
Another example where the number of bits in can mislead is RSA. I have personally broken a 512 bit RSA key on my home computer with about three weeks worth of computation - this is done by determining which two large prime numbers were multiplied together to get the 'modulus' value of the public key.
You can also try to find a different key that happens to hash to the same 160 bit value, as mentioned by the parent.
