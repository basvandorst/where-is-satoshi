I'll make sure I'll remind you.

There was no visibility when the top would come. You can not be smart with lack of datapoint. It's just a gamble at that moment.
You can be smart when you see how it matches to predicted bubble territory right now. If I held any, I'd sell the majority at $10-11K, the rest at $12K or at stop-loss $9K.

You can, right now. Like RIGHT NOW. It is a psychological barrier and it will play around it before final capitulation.

Sorry guys.

They are gooood. Sell, be happy. Put buy orders in for a fraction of what you got out at multiple stages below this level. Don't be greedy. Investing is about smarts.

Why is it unbelievable. It is unbelievable that you are still in.
This is a classic bubble and the phase is called "Capitulation". Get out while you can.

Hey, I wanted to remind you of this, as promised. 
Also note my other comment


Hmm, seems about right on the money in hindsight. Anyway, I would cut my losses. One important note though: 
If you have Tether/USDT, get out now.
Do you want me to remind you in a couple of weeks?

Yeah, man, this sucks I know. I'v been through bubbles and I have been burned $$. I am very cautious now.
Re: long haul. I have learned that one way to look at the market is "would I buy at this price TODAY". Because, every day you hold is the same as if you are starting from scratch and buying today.  But I understand your logic.
I caution everyone about one thing though -- Tether / USDT.
There is *no money* in the back end and they survive only while people believe or BTC is rising. At some point it will become obvious that this is fraud and there will be a run on the BTC/USDT trade. Knowing this, why be caught in that?
Good luck!
