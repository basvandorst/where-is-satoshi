Is that a problem as long as you know the max potential supply and the schedule of new currency deployment?  The demand will be what the market demands.  What is the market cap of the US Dollar?

For every sell there is a buy.  Some good deals to be had recently

A hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger will take care of creating new addresses for you under one seed and reduce your chances of being hacked.  It will be harder to manage if you create a new wallet for every trx.

I have had financial accounts with no activity for 5 years, wouldn't want anyone to be able to tamper with them just because I am not actively using that account for x years.  I don't see a way to know lost vs just saving.

We don't have a way to track destroyed dollars.  Supply and demand is self regulating.

No coinbase account needed.  May want to help them set up a wallet to make sure it is backed up properly with a copy of the seed stored in a safe or some other secure location.   Don't let him become one of the stories in 2025 when he lost his bitcoin and could have had a sweet boat if he had secured it.

It is very interesting that is where your mind went so quickly.

Crypto seems to be pretty widely accepted as shorthand to also include cryptocurrencies.  You don't consider cryptocurrency to be a sub of cryptography as the underlying technology?
How many have you directly influenced to become interested in cryptocurrency?

You running into a lot of EMP attacks on your daily grind?  If so, you may want to invest in a cryptosteel or similar cold storage.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:25:48
Would you honestly want to carry around a cage or have it 100% wrapped in foil to cover emp?  Not very practical.  You could also incase it in concrete and bury it in the sea for extra protection as long as you never need to use it.  Can you direct to any emp protection that is practical? 
Trezor is already temp proof and has been known to survive dunks in water.  The shock proof is from a silicone case that is similar to cell phone covers.

You should always have a non electronic copy of your private key for recovery.  That takes care of that worst case, 1 in a billion chance.

I take mine with me and use an otg cable to connect to my mobile.  It wouldn't be much use stuck in a drawer when I use it for actual transactions.
Some households also have more than 1 Trezor and want to personalize them.

Not today IRS.  Not today.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:24:24
Thanks for the feedback, it is made of silicone.  The Trezor is already water resistant to some level for minor splashes...don't go swimming with it and make transactions at the same time of course.
Additional artist design may be an option in the future but no funds for that project at this time.
The weight is extremely low.  I can't get it to register on a kitchen scale with Trezor and case.  I will need to test with something that registers smaller weight.
