Sir, I pronounce your vapid ramblings as hogwash. Away with Yee this very day.
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:51:26
Drug dealers?
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:39:28
Silly comment
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:53:45
And how does he get the qr code on there with enough accuracy for it to work? Maybe a sticker?
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:44:55
Bitcoin will be free at this rate
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:50:46
This guy just keeps on giving
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:37:32
You might want to start that as a new thread by itself. Might get more attention that way.
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:56:09
Hi there. Please could you explain how you work out how much needs to be sold to reach a set price? Excuse my ignorance :)
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:11:19
Shouldn't that be 'also', not 'either'?
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:08:08
Bart will be here soon, no doubt.
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:59:39
Bit of resistance to 9k today. Cheeky.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:21:12
But they just spent $400 million acquiring it
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:42:42
Sorry to break this to you but...
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:58:59
Basically what your saying is nothing. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:22:09
I was thinking an exchange, but perhaps I'm naive to think that. Is it just bought in bits by different people?
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:32:11
If things hadn't gone stupid over Christmas, ~8k is where the land lies
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:48:50
Well done for exposing this dirty slug. Go post ur useless shit somewhere else
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:03:57
This community is soooo transparently self serving. Needs some better moderation.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:38:30
This thread needs better moderation. People spewing out selfinterested crazy, non information helps nobody. Reminds me of the door to door salesmen of the 80s. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:43:24
I don't think that's normal. I would get a virus checker or similar. Good luck
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:05:55
Yes dad
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:36:42
Don't invest what you can't lose. Especially in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:16:11
You guys are hilarious! Keep it up!
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:46:38
Hi dude. What do you mean 'rebuy the dip'? Without being psychic how do we know when the dip' is? Surely it can dip', go up and then drop again straight away? Am I missing something here
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:42:21
Or... BUY SOMETHING. That's what it's for.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:37:25
By trolls you could mean anyone on this sub. Everyone has a vested interest in movement one way or the other
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:49:16
I guess you made a LOT of money from this crash then?
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:29:02
Hey, that's good web design
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:00:18
What is meant by support?
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:58:25
No apology needed. My last buy was around £360-£400. I use bitcoin to buy and sell things. I do not HODL it, I do not trade it... don't worry, I hear ya...
"LOL. SHIT MAN THIS GUY SPENDS BITCOIN."
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:18:16
This guy porns
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:01:19
Buy some crust old shares in google
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:57:42
You could have had $40m at chriatmas but that wasn't enough? Wtf is wrong with you?
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:36:14
Hi dude. I think I just explained badly. Who would the trustee sell the 200,000BTC to? And how would that sale work? Bit by bit or in one lump or what?
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:13:15
Ahh, you say that. But you seem to have forgotten that Mars is in Jupiter's second house today, and because the sun is casting doubt on financial security we may likely see Bitcoin rise or fall in value
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:08:49
Yeah but I fucking hate Google. Their stupid ads have ruined the internet, they killed YouTube, they put loads of crap on android phones, and they torture teddy bears, probably.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:02:04
I'm thinking down below 5k this time
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:45:24
I hope so. you think this will continue until the deadline on the 27th or whenever it is? could see it drop below 2k if it does. I just can't see China banning bitcoin. why ban something when you can exploit it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:35:45
You hope it's a good time to buy
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:21:39
Could be annoying, fans being noisy etc also how would they make money?
Edit: sorry, I see what you mean now. Might be short term solution.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:37:20
Yeah well, you know what dude, Fuck You. If bitcoin isn't used to buy stuff then what use does it have? If it has no use, then what value do you think it has?
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:32:40
Yeah gold is a good place to store value. It's price is very very stable. That's why gold is a good place to store value.
Imagine a poor Indian family who managed to get hold of some bitcoin in December because there fiat is useless. Do you think they would agree that Bitcoin is a good store of value?
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:02:07
via 2k?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:26:01
Username checks out
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:25:00
How much did you buy at that price? If bitcoin is going strong in 30 years time, we may as well write off all the other cryptos right here and now. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:40:31
thanks for that. could you also let us know the winning lotto numbers for this coming Saturday?
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:06:28
I've put mine at $3070 just incase it doesn't reach $3k
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:27:28
It never happened
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:13:25
Touché. It's just a bit confusing.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:45:06
Thankyou kind sir. So, does it filter out anomalies in effect?
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:14:30
A piece of paper should do just fine
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:38:51
Yeah it's hard to know what to do. I'd say there is fun to be had buying and selling, but if you are more serious about it, and have a large investment, hodling is the way forward
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:42:18
Just moved my stop sell up by $400... Nice.
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:46:21
Value is in the eyes of the behodler 
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:48:06
Chrome purple for me 
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:38:55
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:04:19
90% of that was probably lazy journalists
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:45:31
It's funny, in the uk baloney means pretty much the same as fud...
Baloney deffinition:
"foolish or deceptive talk; nonsense."
"I don't buy it—it's all a load of baloney"
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:46:19
That is buying and selling, not shorting.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:15:01
Could you possibly explain what that means. Sorry to be a n00b
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:53:08
So, your saying it's 10% gold! Woohoo!
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:07:20
But IF you are lucky enough to buy dips you increase your hodling. So when it goes to 50k as you predict, you get a bigger slice of that pie
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:37:16
"Shorting stock is the process of borrowing stock you don't own, selling it, and pocketing the proceeds. Later, you have to buy back the stock and return it to the owner from whom you borrowed the shares. This means a person who shorts a stock makes money when the stock declines, rather than appreciates"
