Legitimate question: does anyone here think this will eventually be enough money to balance out the national debt?
EDIT：I'm serious. If the FBI seized those assets and if bitcoin goes 100 times higher than it is now, then it could be used to fix a very big real world problem.

number 2, number 3, and number 4 are neighboring countries of Venezuela. I hypothesized a while back that people in neighboring countries around Venezuela were buying it and sending it to family and friends still living in Venezuela so that they can take care of themselves.

How about difficulty?

If I may ask, what if it gets wet? My country of residence is prone to heavy rain.

This isn't my video.

Next time try to make a video about it and censor all of the appropriate info (your name, address, etc.)

I thought it was some BS like that. thanks for saving me the click. I'll never go to coindesk again!

I hope me posting this video inspires people to do exactly what you suggested here. Take my upvote.

11k is technically the opposite direction, yo.

What part is absolute nonsense?
BTW, glad to see you got out of Starcraft II just fine as well. Scarlett mentioned you in a game I played against her before...

Just talking about the value of currency though, that clearly isn't saying enough.
Example: I live in Taiwan. if I own 1 million Taiwan dollars, that is far from enough money for a Lambo (even further from enough money for a house).
I'm sure it would be the same way in many other countries where 1 bitcoin is worth a million of some other currency.

Don't click the article in the title.
 - This is what you need to see, in a format better suited for your eyes. This article is basically a copy-cat article for Bank of China.
Long story short, the Chinese article is making the case **for** investing in Bitcoin, and it was published on Bank of China's website (I linked you guys to a copy-cat article on a different site, but rest assured this was published to BoC.cn as well). They ask all the questions and explain it as simply as possible. Why is bitcoin valuable? If I put 1000 yuan (130 USD) on it ten years ago, where would I be? Who is satoshi nakamoto? They even make the appeal to millenials in China by saying if you buy bitcoin it will make getting married easier.

yeah it was a bit coin "vending machine" in Taiwan.

I used a service based out of Taiwan called "Bitoex"

I think the terms "bitcoin" and "dark" triggered the response you got. Automoderation on Facebook is awful.

Any particular reason for the dip to 5050?

How far away is lightning network? I'm bullish on another cryptocurrency and this week I'm thinking of putting a bit more bitcoin in to my portfolio.
Also, who is the developer behind lightning network and how can I keep an eye on it?

I'm aware. say i want to buy 200 usd worth of bitcoin using PayPal, how much would I be charged total?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:41:17
I am aware. Thanks anyway, but I'm not interested in doing something "off the books."
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:38:23
Apparently I'm not able to because I live in Taiwan.
