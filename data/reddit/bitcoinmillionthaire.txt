That was actually one of the reasons for making /r/ account. need to mature 100 days and something about karma, before selling on bitmarket

Lol 'Millionth' as in "I have 0.0000001 BTC "   but why not? It says Make Offer.. These things are selling for $20,000 and $25,000 on eBay, what's up with that?

And how do I tip anyway, i've been wondering how to do that.. Really the only reason I signed up to reddit was to tip people bitcoins.. Until I took it to the casino, and you know what happened next

As long as they can take 15% of it from every sale.. Okay, its not 15%, its 10% plus 3% plus $0.30, per sale, which is way too much. Ebay fees are ridiculous, but what am I to do? I want to sell things for bitcoins, so I can offer my items at lower prices and still break even, but Bitmit is closing down, apparently Coingig doesn't get much traffic, and to post on I have to wait 100 days and post 100 times, ot get 100 karma or something. IMO, eBay accepting bitcoin is kind of like a predator opening a daycare. They just want to take a piece for themselves, the Free nature of Bitcoin and the Fee-heavy nature of eBay are contradictory, they don't belong together. I would like to see a marketplace where I can sell things with the popularity/traffic of eBay, without having to calculate for ~15% losses on everything I sell.

Thanks for that link, pretty new here.  But for $5999, , the miners are sold out into May, and they're profitable until ?September unless an insane skyrocket in BTC value or a massive EMP (the true Coinwarz)

a jug fills drop by drop. How do I get people to help me raise a little btc to get some nuns a decent pc, along with a little BTC and some btc+reddit lessons?

My money was stolen from Fargo.  They don't care because bitcoin.  I  would advise you to be your own bank and steer clear of those people.

so many people are blind to it. New laws silently enacted every day, restricting our freedoms. Theoretically,  Bitcoin should constantly increase in USD/BTC value as more and more worthless green pieces of paper are churned out. just like a nickel used to buy a coke, now it's over $1. well $250 might buy you a bitcoin now, but if it's anything like coke, and they keep makong more dollars, then $10,000/BTC is by no means unrealistic.

Finite supply. That and the fact that nobody listened when I recommended they get it while it's cheap, just like Tesla Motors.  in both cases, I was met with negativity. Then, when I was going to buy bitcoin,  I got screwed by banks and identity thieves, setting me back quite a bit. the only thing they didn't steal was my tiny bit of coin, which I ended up investing in the worst altcoins. Some people are destined for greatness.  I,  apparently,  am destined for mediocrity,  at best. That's how I know it will turn out awesome.  something I wanted to get into early on but didn't,  always turns out awesome. Was going to buy gold back when it was like $420/oz. Didn't. The girl that asked me to be her boyfriend when we were little,  and I wanted to, more than anything(seriously,  like "Be My Wife!", When I'm idk maybe 7 ), but said nope to avoid hurting her friends' feelings? Turned out to be the most awesome girl I could ever want to spend my life with.  Too late for me though.  Same deal with bitcoin,  unless I magically land a decent job, soon, which is hard with no ID and a felony (fleeing&amp;eluding, seriously,  who knew it was a felony to have fun like Bo&amp;LukeDuke?). All Bitcoin needs is more users, globally, and for me to make an easily accessible,  non-illegal marketplace to compete with eBay(because all the other ones mysteriously shut down)
