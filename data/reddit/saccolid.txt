I heard this story in “Charlie Wilson’s War” line told by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

She actually invested in Ethereum. It’s on her twitter.

If you say it, it means it will happen. 100,000 BTC so we can all have lambos.

I look forward to it passing 20k and you’ll see Lamborghini memes. Then it hits 40k and everyone is losing their ever loving minds. Then it crashes to 20k and everyone saying see? What a fraud. Bitcoins dead. History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes. (I think that was Twain, it’s a famous quote whoever said it)

Lies. This is the end of the world. I should have bought tulips or Pets.com. It’s fallen all the way to only being up 40% in the last month. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO LIVE?

Which Winklevoss posted this?

Congrats on being early. To me, and to most people who are following this.... we believe balls to bone that BTC or blockchain at least is the future of a global currency. I absolutely wouldn't cash out yet or you'll regret that for a very long time.  I slowly incrementally invest month over month ignoring the ups and downs of the coin-a-coaster.  Remember, the only thing that matters is where it's going, not where it is or where it's been. Hide your wallet and log it up in 10 years and see if you can retire.  Age gives you perspective and 40k isn't actually a lot of money when you are talking long term.

This whole sub hanging out in jail for not understanding the stupidity of how crypto is taxed.

But I thought it was a bubble!

Can we please have people change their sell orders to 10,010 please? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 23:24:07
Uh oh, this might not be a good sign.

A fool and their money are soon parted...... that’s how I view ICO’s currently.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:39:21
Or you could buy crypto with money you actually have instead of running it up on credit?

If you sent even a small amount to an address known to be used for gambling or purchasing something potentially illegal that would trigger it.
