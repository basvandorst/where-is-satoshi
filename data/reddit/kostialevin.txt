What about this? 
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:31:33
4695670 SEK = 582051 USD = 2328 XBT  am I right?
@_date: 2015-06-29 09:56:59
At least until there will be enough block-space for all..
@_date: 2015-06-14 21:57:17
They are trusting a system, a protocol, a rule, not a third-party.

Let's fork bitcoin-core with a 20 MB block. I want a node without the 1 MB limit. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:44:47
134709 x 2 = 269418  =&gt;
269418 - 233280 = 36138
=&gt; 36138 transactions every day will not find a place in the blockchain.
It's not a matter of time, the problem is that the network will be overloaded, and just like many things when overloaded, it will start to have problems.. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:21:10
This release switches to a new versioning and branching scheme. The numeric part of the version indicates the version of Bitcoin Core the build is based on. The letter part represents the revision of the patch set. Note that the useragent, command line tools etc don't presently include the "A" as it's the first release and it's easier/more compatible to not have it if unnecessary for disambiguation. Each release has a branch. Features are no longer also put into separate branches: if you want to grab a patch, grab it from the latest release instead.
We are up to 87 XT nodes! That's great, thanks to everyone supporting Lighthouse and other projects by running XT.

Good. Prevention is better than cure.

Because with just 8 connections you're just "listening" to the network, you are not actively working accepting and forwarding transactions and blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:51:23
I'm with you.. and I'm also mining, even if electricity for me is very expensive, but I want to "support" bitcoin with my few GH :)
@_date: 2015-12-18 06:52:44
If they need more than 3 tps, they will never start to use bitcoin as it is today, with the 1MB limit. It simply won't work.
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:24:21
And if it will?

I'm not enforcing, not ignoring.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:09:28
We need numbers! 6000 nodes means centralized or decentralized? 3000? 300? Which number makes bitcoin "unsecure"?
20 MB means that we'll go from 6000 to how many? 
And if 20MB means wider adoption and we go from 6000 to 60000?
Remember that the 1MB limit is not a feature, was intended to be a temporary fix for spam.

Should bitcoin be for rich only?
What about the "poor world citizens" that want to start to save their little wealth in bitcoin? 
Higher fee could be too high for someone..

I just want to say that with the higher fees solution, there's the risk to leave someone out of bitcoin because too expensive.

Take a 4 lane highway in peak hours and reduce it to only one lane, you'll have the same results: a big traffic jam and chaos.

I can accept to have some other ways to do payments (lightning, sidechains, companies like Circle or Coinbase etc), but I think even 20 MB are't enough for 6-7-8 billions people. Bitcoin must scale, bitcoin must be open and accessible to everyone (even to whom can't afford a full node).

You're great! 
@_date: 2014-11-17 11:27:58
Install from unknown source is never safe.
Better is to install TOR browser ( on a computer, change identity until  says I'm from USA and then go to the play store   login, and install circle from there.
I did it.
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:01:18
If you can send sepa you can use kraken.com. I use them to buy bitcoin from Italy and I can see my transfer in a couple of days max.

@_date: 2015-01-09 13:26:54
*How divisible are bitcoins?
A bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction. If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.*
And decimal places are infinite..
However, in my flyer "infinitamente" is a shorter approximation of "one hundred million units".
My scope is just to raise people's curiosity.

Can you imagine all bitcoins destroyed in unspendable addresses? Bitcoin will not exists anymore.

Bitcoin is not dead.. it's just trading.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:59:10
I don't think that to be so much divisible is a feature.. I've written it just because every time I speak about bitcoin, the fact that a single bitcoin is a lot of money generates some difficulties to understand how it's possible to use it for small amount as 50 cent.
I want to be clear about the fact that it's not necessary to own an entire bitcoin to have some bitcoins.. :)

Bitcoin is math and statistics, not voting.
@_date: 2015-08-10 09:29:47
Bitcoin is a protocol, like HTTP.
We have apache, iis and others and the web is working fine.
For bitcoin it actually exists also conformal btcd and others. 
I don't see any problems in changing the rules, let the people free to decide if a blocksize increase is good or not.
Core devs start to seem an oligarchy.
@_date: 2015-08-29 08:14:32
I think is good to remember that Gavin was chosen by Satoshi.

Why we need to introduce another voting system in Bitcoin? The only vote has to be the one every node has. Bitcoin has to be regulated only by math, functions, statistics, not human will.

"It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; **115000**)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade."

And however hard fork is because of block size. Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Core+BIP101 can quietly coexist after the fork.
@_date: 2015-07-23 07:55:12
There's bitcoin core, bitcoin XT, conformal btcd and others.. all compatibles. Bitcoin is a protocol, bitcoin-core just an implementation.
If the max block size is the same I see no problem running different node, in my opinion it is even better, it makes the network more reliable and difficult to attack.
