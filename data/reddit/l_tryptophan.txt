all we need is another meme for everyone to follow.  worked great for the wallstreet meme, taking us from 19000 to 3000

Why? I love the fact that the biggest technology of the next decade currently has massive amounts of sellers. My pay checks arnt big enough for a massive pump in price yet.

you must not know what bitmex is?
People are making a killing from having people sell bitcoin. Some people who shorted btc at 15,000 STILL havnt closed their short positions yet. Literally so easy to make money by shitting on anything positive and spreading bs. Not to mention all the people who missed the boat in 2017 and just drooling at the chance of getting in sub 2000, will continue spreading bs

people need to stop day trading memes and maybe we'd see normal movements

It is much easier to buy bitcoin today . There are also many more people who know what bitcoin is and are willing to invest when it becomes easier and stops declining. Users of today will be hodlers for a long time after enduring 2018. The market is completely different than the mt gox days.
Therefore, you can throw these meme TA graphs out the window because the next bull run will be much sooner than October.

Every 25 year old professional crypto trader with self made PHD in tech analysis from youtube university thinks $2500 is the bottom, and this is a big reason its dropped since they believe they can buy in lower.
Which is why im pretty confident we are at the bottom RIGHT NOW, and the day traders that sold below 5,500 and especially the ones selling in the 3000's are going to get burned when they keep waiting for 2500 that will never come. They will continue to wait until eventually btc is back to the "relative" stable level of $6500, and they have to buy back in higher.
With all the manipulation, short selling, and idiots hoping to buy back cheaper, the ride back up to 6500 will come pretty fast.
