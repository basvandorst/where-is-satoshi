The entire world already does not observe every Bitcoin transaction.  We have SPV clients, web wallets, third party services.  Also Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is quite efficient at doing what it does.  The goal is not only money transfer, but decentralized security, something trustless and permissionless, something autonomous that can't be stopped or shut down.  On these fronts it outcompetes the legacy system. In fact the legacy system would compare to it like a horse and buggy to a jumbo jet.  Bitcoin is something that has never existed before, so there is not much to compare it to when it comes to efficiency except maybe proof of stake, which came afterwards.
Also it does take a lot of mining power, but I don't see that as inefficiency because the network could easily run on much less mining power.  People just want that Bitcoin so they are willing to compete.  POS could be considered more efficient too.
Your imagination of the future may be somewhat true, but I think that there could possibly be automous solutions that allow for offchain transactions without trust. Sidechain innovation may help with this as well.  We just do not see these solutions yet because they are not needed yet, and we are still in early stages.

No it wouldn't collapse.  You could just pay an increased fee to provide incentives to miners to include your transaction.  The fees will be regulated by the market also.  If the network fees get too high, then offchain transactions will rise, and independent entities will step in to provide transfers for less of a fee.  Free market at work.  However this would result in less decentralization, which could be somewhat bad.
