I was wondering how long it would take for someone to say that. I wanted some honest answers and maybe "Oh hey you're doing something wrong." but now apparently the bitcoin community is just as bad as the product.
Thanks though.

Bitgrail is an online exchange that you can trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies. It's relativity unknown because it's pretty much exclusively used for RaiBlocks trading.
Edit: USA

I see! Thank you very much. That makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:56:37
Not a wallet that you download. A exchange...
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:32:34
Couldn't agree more tbh. I just sent bitcoin to a wallet about 8 hours ago and it still hasn't cleared. Meanwhile, all the XRB I've sent clears within a minute. No idea how people are still believing that this is the "tech" of the future.
Bitcoin pioneered it, but screwed up implementation for scaling and tx fees.

After browsing through a lot of posts on here now I think you're right. A whole lot of people who don't know what they're talking about and think that people really have the time and care enough to come 'shill'.
Nooooo.... Maybe your product just has flaws? But instead of accepting that or trying to fix it, they get upset. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:42:58
For good reason; aka it has first movers advantage and is the most mainstream. If you take a good look at Bitcoin vs. other alts you'll see that that's really the only reason. 
My bottom line is that I'm losing cash because it's taking over a day to transfer BTC. Which is completely infeasible and not stable for a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:45:21
Thank you for the very informative comment. Can you explain why my transaction is taking so long, but people who have sent BTC in the last few hours have already received it? Are transactions not chronologically processed.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:53:43
That makes sense. So is there any way to guesstimate how much longer mine will take or not?

Not even that- they _could_ be arbitrary, but they're not. That entire exaflop of calculations is dedicated to holding a giant economy on it's shoulders, just by doing calculations. I'd say that's not pointless or arbitrary.

You seem to overestimate how hard it is to hack someone- in some cases just running a java applet can install a keylogger on your machine, which is more than enough to find all that information.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:15:20
I sat there waiting for it to load then realized it was done XD
EDIT: Replied to wrong person. Derp. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:14:08
Guys! This thing, it's bad. It's called Bitcoin, we can't tell you what it is, because we can't understand it ourselves. But it's bad.

You can hook the pi up to an ASIC- why buy a laptop when you can use a ton less power?
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:11:28
You got .007 BTC. Not a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:46:33
No he's not, it's incredibly easy to mix JavaScript with a site that does not sanitize input, to steal BTC. That's exactly what happened to btc-e a week ago.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:47:44
While this is true, JScript can still be dangerous to websites with sanitization exploits.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:34:13
Want to use my address to try? :D
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:53:02
What do you use to mine LTC?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:06:16
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:23:06
It's relevant alright- but the circumstances are different this time. 90%+ people still haven't even heard of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:03:46
Right now I've only made ~$.14 but it's pretty cool to see it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:15:44
Why thank you :D
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:35:35
Yeah. I bought one yesterday at 144$.
Word of advice: Hire me as a broker and do exactly opposite of what i say.
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:34:31
Yeah, we need to track this guy down.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:27:38
I wish. I'd have myself a little botting farm.
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:14:22
Thanks for that, I'm on mobile!

Perhaps after seeing the amount of interest and the jump in price over the past few weeks they will be swayed :)
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:03:29
I'm pretty new to GitHub as well (been using for a few months), if you'd like I may be able go give you some tips.
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:08:12
You'd be suprised.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:37:55
Thanks! I'm using bitcoin-qt, where can I distinguish between the two?

finalBTCPrice = usdPrice / BTCRatio;
fixed ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:36:11
Yeah. Unfortunately I tried mining and am only running 2.1MHash/s with 3 out of 4 of my cores doing the work. Perhaps I should invest in a ASIC.

Your first tip worked, it's always so it gets a message in it's inbox.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:35:39
Probably not with the same bot, but I'm sure there is a way to write a plugin for it.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:18:53
Good for you guys!

@_date: 2013-04-12 18:27:21
I'll check it out- but when I was mining LTC I donated 3% (+ 2% native fee). 5% isn't that much I figured, so fees don't really matter for me :)
Also, what are namecoins?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:14:08
If I had BTC I would tip you so hard right now.
@_date: 2013-05-11 15:55:45
But in general, all calculations are inherently arbitrary, no?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:08:26
Probably a bug in the system, or the API's aren't working. Possibly hackers screwed with the API.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:48:54
Any advantage?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:15:34
Yeah. :)
