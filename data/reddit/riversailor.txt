...and how sure are you that a "deflationary monetary policy" is something to be desired?

I don't think it adds up. 673 BTC/BCH nodes in Hangzhou, 1245 ABC nodes, 673/1245=54% BUT it's false that all 673 Hangzhou nodes are Bitcoin ABC.  Not even half of them are.  You are straight-up LYING.

SegWit is already activated by the miners. For SegWit to have an effect, more addresses need to support it (wallets) as well, since the nodes will only use SegWit if the address sends the transaction using it. Right now only 10% of transactions are SegWit, which is why block size has been creeping above 1MB over the fall. It seems to have gotten stuck, though, because too many addresses still haven’t upgraded.
Lightning will be hugely important. We need it soon, and we need a new generation of walkers that (1) support SegWit and (2) do a better job of selecting the right fee level for the transaction.
For years the network was lightly loaded and many wallets (including the on-line wallet services like Coinbase) used a naive approach to transactions and didn’t optimize the fee offer for the transaction type: some transactions don’t need to be in the next 2 blocks (I can wait a day, if I’m sending money to London, so I don’t need to offer much of a fee), but the wallets I’ve used don’t offer me an interface for fee negotiation/estimation.
I’m not an expert, however. If you are, and I’ve made an error here, please point it out. I’m not embarrassed by being wrong as long as I learn something from it ;-)
