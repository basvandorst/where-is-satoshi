Sell and buy back :) In the morning you'll have even more bitcoins!

The latest articles suggest he didn't even lose any bitcoins... he tricked the robbers!

If so why didn't the price keep increasing?  Why has there been a correction before futures launch rather than after?

This is really sad, am sorry to hear this :(

Lightning network completed tests successfully.  Then it's definately useful as a currency.

Each time Bitcoin shrugs off a challenge, it increases it's legitimacy.  Hence, once shitcoincrash is seen off,  the question of whether it can be removed as the incumbent currency is gone.  Confidence will increase even further in Bitcoin.

Why didn't coinbase announce when exactly they will add bitcoin cash?   This is poor behaviour from a major exchange.  It's not like CBE went, surprise futures today!
This addition and preceding pump and dump is insider trading in any other context than crypto.

No each time it's dipped an recovered , it's given further proof that Bitcoin is a resilient store of value.  Hence, gives further confidence to invest.

Is there way energy usage could be reduced, yet still maintain security?

Every time  it dips and survives, I feel it litigimises the currency even more.

Would be good if value stays stable for a while that will increase confidence 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:04:16
Haha I thought that too

Probably be dead in decades

Unfortunately you are correct, this dumping and fudding will undermine long term confidence.

And put it in the hands of different scum
