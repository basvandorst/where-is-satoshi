I’m in the UK, seen a lot about eToro but the same thing on reviews 1 star rating with hundreds of complaints about lost money...

Struggling to find an exchange to use, I’ve been looking around for something reliable with good customer service and the ability to sort something out when it goes wrong but every website review I’m looking at has hundreds of people complaining about lost money or no response from customer service...

I literally can’t trust the reviews, most 5 stars are from people that have only left 1 review on one website so nothing reliable. I guess the best way to start is to start off small until you find an exchange you can trust in

Shame I don’t have any real money to put in, I bought in at the last dip (first time buyer)
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:55:37
Yup, done a few hundred of them in the UK

Yeah I had this whilst trying to watch a programme online, my cpu was running at 100% and I kept getting alerts saying there’s a bitcoin miner open on my computer. Downloaded an extension for chrome to block it and closed the page down. Hope this doesn’t become the norm from now that most website start using miners to generate income instead of ads

He went solo for a while then returned to fiverr after some insane backlash about banning him over the pewdiepie video

How much did you make?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:26
Because people are buying bitcoin with money they don’t have
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:39:59
Takes a bit of time but I make some good extra wage on top of what I’m currently earning

I remember being unemployed, struggling to find work or any stable job back in 2011/2012 I was looking online about how to make money from home when I discovered bitcoins and something about mining them with my computer gpu (which would have been a piece of shit back then)
I didn’t follow it through but in 2018 I bought into the dip thinking fuck it bows my chance. I’m putting small bits of what I can afford into bitcoin every couple of weeks or so. A lot of my mates have said “blah blah bubble burst etc” but I can really see virtual currency taking over int he future, back when I was unemployed I didn’t even think we would be able to contactless pay for stuff in shops or even through my phone. From what I can see the world is moving more and more into the virtual world....

This has given me an idea, I work at an audiovisual company and we get tons of faulty/old players returned to be recycled that still work. Could these all be wired up and used to mine some coins instead of recycling them or is it unrealistic? as they are literally just built for advertising displays in banks/phone stores

Was this taken from a programme about cryptocurrency as a whole or just a segment? Would like to watch the whole thing if there is one

Damn, you can tell how much that hurt him. I’ve been watching the recent spaceX launches and this is inspiring. Why would anyone put another person down publicly that are trying to achieve amazing things for mankind.
Well done to Elon for sticking to his guns and proving he can do just about anything, the man is a legend.

What’s segwit?

I get at least 500 computers/digital advertising players a year come through here but they are old and will prob not be worth using as I think about it. I recycle most the CPU’s and RAM sticks so can make money from them that
