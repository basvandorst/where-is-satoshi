Mixing Bitcoin only obscures the money trail until it starts to be used by someone who doesn't need privacy. 
Using Monero ensures mixing behaviour by default. Worth noting is that Monero has an option to reveal your money trail for audit. This would be difficult to do if you used a Bitcoin mixer.

While the majority of miners do not have full power on scaling decisions, they do make the blocks so they do have a lot of power in the form of providing the best security.


That's a pretty big if.


Miners pay themselves.


Free speech is dangerous now?


If users decide that Classic or something else are doing a better job and the majority of people choose a smaller chain then that is by definition the new Bitcoin - the miners would switch over. My point is it's not a hostile takeover if the majority actually want what they're building.


It's not free because they're competing with other miners.


Transaction fees are a great way to measure the needs of the network! More fees = more demand/users.


There was a lot of discussing but also a lot of inaction. I'm happy to see greater competition and more implementations.

No, without adaptive block size the miners have full power on whether or how to scale. With it, miners have no choice but to scale with the needs of the network.
@_date: 2016-04-01 07:32:24
An adaptive block size limit solves the problem of miners using their power to decide when to scale the network.
The reason the block size limit hasn't been raised is because they are concerned with network latency.
An adaptive block size limit removes this decision from the miners and ensures scalability no matter the network latency.
In the end users will need to choose - problems with network latency or problems with miner centralisation.

The average Joe may value the higher risk/reward in Bitcoin. Given that the stock markets are trading near all time highs and Bitcoin has a low correlation - it makes sense for many to get some exposure in case it takes off in a big way.
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:52:30
The average Joe doesn’t care that it’s different, only that it is increasing in value.
Bitcoin and other cryptos doesn’t need to compete as currencies, they only need to not lose purchasing power as fast as governments’ currencies.
Holding crypto as an asset that appreciates as more people see it as a better alternative to leaving money in a low interest savings account or risky stocks is a real use case that some may say is better than just being a currency.

Not all people are rational - some will sell others will hold.
You gain transactional privacy when using crypto over credit cards. Sure transactional privacy isn’t for everyone and using a card is simple for most people, but the draw for the average Joe is an alternative currency/investment that is not only very different to the present system, but also rising in value over the long term.

BRD uses the recovery phrase (seed) to generate your private keys. The BRD source code is available on GitHub. 
Your private keys are tied to your public keys - which are stored in the blockchain. Though public key is not exactly the same as your bitcoin address the public concept is the same.
A good explanation here 
You cannot import private keys into ledger because it only generates private keys on the device - importing keys defeats the security purpose it serves. Other wallets you should be able to import keys once converted from the recovery phrase.

Diversification is sensible in any savings. The more volatility, the less you should invest - but this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t save in high risk markets.
The antithesis of savings is not volatility, but spending.
The volatility of Bitcoin is a function of its lack of liquidity - a problem that is caused by a considerable lack of people who save it. Spending is also hard because of volatility.

I haven't been able to get my head around 'Example 2' in the GST draft ruling. I'd really appreciate if anyone can explain it!




So my question is: Does Paul claim credits of $700 for the bitcoin and $700 for the server? To me it makes no sense why he'd be able to claim a 10% credit twice.
Example 3 (which talks about the intermediary processing bitcoins) depends on understanding Example 2.

I believe they mean the merchant needs to immediately cash out 10% for GST (if registered for GST) and pay ordinary income tax on the other 90% at the value in AUD at the time of transaction.
If the remaining 90% bitcoins are held for speculation then capital gains tax would apply on that remaining value.
For accounting simplicity, GST registered merchants would need to cash out any bitcoins daily and hold a separate book for personal investments.

Hey mate, I'm not qualified but in the guidelines the ATO mentions that:


 means an account mentioned in item 1 in the table in regulation 40-5.09; and...
Where item 1 in that table says:








So within their legal framework they have some legal backing for their claim that it's not an account under the GST act as it stands.
Of course changing the law would be easier if enough people cared for it.
I believe a good legal argument against the ATO is this:






Negotiable instrument is undefined in the GST act. I think the resemblance between Bitcoin and negotiable instruments is striking.
The Encyclopaedic Australian Legal Dictionary 35 defines a 'negotiable instrument' as:


The ATO say:


Let's go through the definition of negotiable instrument.


Could be an embedded contract / signed transaction in the blockchain.


The direction by the 1st person could be a signed transaction broadcasted onto the Bitcoin network. The 2nd person could be the person operating the miner that happens to form the transaction into a block resulting in the third person receiving the money.


This ability is certainly already possible on the blockchain - which is really just a document that is instantly delivered globally.


Digital signatures; online document signed and delivered via the Internet.


The document is not a physical document so this doesn't apply.


Right to spend bitcoins are enforced immediately after one confirmation, as stipulated by the software protocol.


And that's where my argument completely falls to the ground!
Seriously though, if some real lawyers could look at this last paragraph or just tell me I'm way off course here I'd appreciate it.
In any case, the evolution of money into Bitcoin shares some semblance with negotiable instruments. [Interesting to read about it on the wiki](
Edit: Negotiable instruments can have an immediate maturity date.

A friend rang me in early 2011 to rave about this great new thing he discovered on the Internet called Bitcoin and it was going up in value quickly (it was around $5 at the time). He told me to buy some graphics cards and build a computer. I watched the price soar to $31 over the next few weeks and proceeded to buy the gfx cards and parts. 
I mined for about a year, sold a lot of the bitcoins at market price + a small percentage on local bitcoins to cover electricity costs, got sucked down the rabbit hole, bought FPGAs, ASICs and Bitcoin stocks/mining bonds.
One year later I miraculously landed a full time job which I kept long enough to apply for a personal loan of $20k which I promptly sunk into Bitcoin at ~$5. My co-workers thought I'd gone mad.
I invested the bitcoins into mostly mining bonds like GIGAMINING. I got a sense of how easy it was to manipulate penny stocks' prices in an illiquid market and how traders make money on spreads.
The dividends from mining bonds were fantastic (around 2-3% a week) and I got fired from my job shortly after. I was apathetic at work because I was starting to make as much money from Bitcoin.
The GIGAMINING price tanked over the next few months (they were investing in Butterfly Labs hardware) and I cashed out for around a 63% loss, but the Bitcoin price had doubled to around $10 at this stage so with dividends I was around break even.
You would think I would have learnt my lesson by then about not investing my bitcoins into high risk ventures but unfortunately I hadn't.
I started to travel and went to the first Bitcoin conference which was really great and made me realise Bitcoin could absolutely be an industry of its own. I saw the Lamassu machine on display and realised that hardware could be a bridge for people in the offline world to see Bitcoin as a real thing.
Bitcoin rose, many friends and family told me to cash out or at least cover my loan. I complied and cashed out a lot of bitcoins at around the $40 mark to pay back my loan.
I later invested in 15 Lamassu machines to diversify my Bitcoin holdings.
I invested ~600 bitcoins in NEOBEE. Not too long after that (just a couple months back) [I got hacked ~750 bitcoins which I kept on my laptop.](
I now have much less bitcoins which I store on a Trezor, BitGo and Casascius coins (bought in 2012). I'm very active in the Bitcoin space and still think it's the best thing since sliced bread.
I'm now based in Taiwan learning Mandarin. My thoughts are that anyone buying bitcoins today is very much an early adopter. Bitcoin wallets have a really long way to go before everyday people can easily use them and understand the nuances of Bitcoin, the blockchain and confirmations. I'm now part of a soon-to-launch Bitcoin start up that's working on a really cool and convenient hardware Bitcoin wallet!

While I agree that the gold like exception for GST would be most appropriate, I don't think this is as simple as making small changes.
There would for example be instance where Bitcoin transactions would incur GST liabilities. A new category like digital currency that encompasses the precious metal GST exemption and outlines specific GST and capital gains best practices would be a favourable outcome.
Where I'm coming from with this petition is for Australia to not repeat the mistakes that the UK HMRC did in applying VAT then after consultation with the Bitcoin industry reversing their stance and hopefully we can learn from the mistake of not consulting with the Bitcoin industry from the US IRS which will likely burden everyone there with extra paperwork.

* Join meet ups in your local area to further brainstorm and educate new users. If there isn't a meet up in your area, create one!
* Make it a personal goal to talk to 10 strangers every day about Bitcoin. This is the best opportunity to move the focus of the public from the exchange problems (Mt Gox) to the benefits of a purely person to person value transfer system (Bitcoin).

@_date: 2014-08-20 08:44:16
This draft release is a trojan horse. As you say capital gains is a favourable tax for individual investors. They have also said that GST needs to be charged to buyers. I understand that Bitcoin has to be taxed some how - but GST is not the way to do it. We've seen the unworkability of GST with online retail.
When Australian traders and exchanges need to levy buyers with a 10% tax on the price of Bitcoin they will source bitcoins from overseas and our exchanges will be put at a competitive disadvantage. This is bad for a number of reasons.
1. Bitcoin becomes more expensive to use and becomes an inferior money.
2. Increases reliance on wire services.
3. Increases Bitcoin's exposure to fraud reversible services
4. Increases trader's accounting expenses, further pushing up cost of acquisition
5. Increases concentration of wealth in the big 4.
I urge you to comment to ATO about the GST aspect.

There is no decipherable meaning in your post. It just reads like an overreaction to a price drop and doesn't add much value. Stereotyping the Bitcoin community as skeptical and ungenerous does not constitute a meaningful post to me.


Yes, people would then be able to create derivative works adding to the collective value of Bitcoin. Also people are then not limited to download a binary, which like I said before is a cause for concern for some.
I understand that your intentions are not bad and that Unity is a well respected framework with an option for a web player which void concern for viruses or a scam. But please be aware that when you bitch and moan about 1 (and only) 1 person donating it comes across as a desperate cry for attention.

My point stands that if you're wiring large amounts (over 2k) there will be ways people can easily obtain Bitcoin overseas at a discount, thus undercutting Australian exchanges and traders.
GST is not applied fairly to everyone - that was the sell. Gold dealers and raw food producers have exemptions and financial institutions have input tax credits reducing the amount of GST they need to pay.
GST creates an uneven playing field for Bitcoin with 10% going to the government that would normally be the savings for working immigrants using it for remittance.
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:44:17


Sure, if you're wiring $50 at a time.


GST is a tax on the consumer, levied by the business (which increases administrative burden and costs for the business) having a net effect of increased costs for the businesses and consumers.
Sure it is built into the price but this is not a 'pretty awesome deal'.
Bitcoin is not something you go shopping for. It's another monetary system that should be given the chance to compete fairly with the banks.

To invest heavily and regularly in Bitcoin after just finding out about it, after it's had a 10 fold rise in value, then reading the whitepaper is not investing. It's speculating.
You make the assumption that all the early adopters cashed out without contributing anything in return. That's what speculators do. Not all early adopters are speculators. But some speculators can be early adopters. 
There's a lot of potential for market manipulation in unregulated markets. If you're 'investment' horizon is just one year why are you proselytising to your friends and family? They're quite right to be skeptical, no wonder they're mocking you now.

I don't think you necessarily need to prove that you were hacked. If they say they don't believe you, just ask them why you would waste yours and their time making up stories? You could tell them that the evidentiary burden should fall on Lake BTC to prove that the transaction was legitimate.
Those hops will be difficult to prove but you're lucky that there's only 4. If the person who traded them for fiat is not the hacker, there's a good chance that they traded with them and may be co-operative if they learn that you were hacked.
If they are the hacker they could make up a fake story about an anonymous trade, but if your police investigator asks for corroborative evidence they might slip up somewhere.

Hi, you should buy bitcoins using cash. Credit cards are very bad for your privacy because your bank and government will know that you bought the bitcoins and even if you mix your coins there's a high chance that they can still trace your coins. Read: mass surveillance.

(Ninja edit) Depends, only Australian businesses need to collect GST. Foreign businesses that are mostly based in Australia can be treated as Australian businesses for tax purposes.  Also, consumers never need to think about GST as it's supposed to be built into the price by the Australian businesses.


If by set up shop, you mean register an Australian bank account (either as a foreign company or as an Australian company), and by shop you mean a Bitcoin exchange then very little GST needs to be charged (only on your exchange fee). This is because your business is a marketplace rather than a brokerage (you're not doing actively trading, buying, selling and setting spreads). This is similar to BTCmarkets.net
If by shop you mean a Bitcoin broker (you **are** doing active trading, buying, selling and setting spreads) then yes, you will need to charge 10% of the sale value of Bitcoin to any Australian customers.
The fact that you might be a foreign company might not count for much if the majority of your business revenue comes from Australia.
Bottom line, setting up a Bitcoin exchange is a good way to avoid the ludicrous 10% GST on the sale price of Bitcoin in Australia.

In my interpretation, there are no capital gains tax on profits if the total annual amount is less than $10,000. The ATO does not consider Bitcoin money, so the FX treatment of Bitcoin/GST can't apply.
This means if you buy $15,000 of Bitcoin today at an Australian Bitcoin exchange or high volume trader you will pay $16,500 including GST. Realistically no one in their right mind would voluntarily pay 10% more for bitcoins, they would just use an overseas exchange.
When you sell it you should charge 10% GST if your registered for GST and your combined annual income is $75,000 or higher.
You may be able to claim a 10% rebate if you can show a receipt including GST for your original purchase.
If the bitcoins went up 5% by the time you sold then you would also need to pay capital gains tax on the profit ($75) at your marginal tax rate.
But realistically you're going to sell at a 10% loss if you're selling. If you're spending your bitcoins anywhere outside Australia, you're selling for a 10% loss. Realistically there is no sane person who would calculate CGT when doing online shopping.
CGT is mostly important if you're in the business of day trading high volume amounts.

China bans just about everything and so do governments. Look at history:

It seems the governments have largely realised they can't outright ban Bitcoin as it would backfire on them similarly.
Every government is treating Bitcoin companies as money remittance companies for KYC so the co-ordinated global restricting of Bitcoin has already started.
I imagine what will happen to the Bitcoin companies that comply with restrictions will be allowed to continue, while independent traders will be discouraged.
I don't think an all-out ban will happen. Biased media stories will keep a lid on adoption.

Overall this is very bad news for individuals, even those who spent less than $10,000 for personal use. If at any point the net capital gain is more than $10,000 the income needs to be reported. So If someone invests $5,000 and two years later it's worth $50,000 tax needs to be paid even though there is no legal framework or regulations protecting the individual if the exchange or deal went sour.

Bitcoin is jurisdiction-less and there is no basis for a decentralised and open source project to comply with the laws of particular countries. What's more, there are many countries that don't have KYC laws for Bitcoin transactions so introducing a KYC standard could cause confusion and regulation creep.


[Never use the state as a metric for ethics](


If I had to upload a scan of my ID and passport, a picture of me holding my ID, passport and fill out my residential address to transact online, I would opt to go with cash payment instead because I value my time. The price value may be the same, but the time value is not.
Now KYC has some value in that you may be able to know who your counterparty is in the event of fraud. But a BIP is a **Bitcoin** Improvement Proposal and Bitcoin removes the cost of these trust models for people that don't need or want them.

I agree that the BIP75 thing is overblown though, having just read through the proposal now I think it could make certain wallets like Bread easier for people to use Bitcoin and less likely to send bitcoins into a void.
If banks can adhere to KYC regulations by tracking their customers' bitcoins, then mainstream adoption may happen much quicker.
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:19:47


Not everyone mixes their coins. I think it's pretty safe to say that the majority of users don't. I am not so confident that Bitcoin will retain its fungibility given the amount of volume Bitcoin users do on KYC style exchanges.


You do realise there's no law requiring businesses to accept cash, right?


@_date: 2016-06-02 10:57:10
What I'm getting at is that GST *is* required on a purchase of bitcoin as the law currently stands.


The fact that it doesn't affect Btrade because they got a private ruling doesn't mean that the law absolves all the Bitcoin traders using the service from their GST obligations.
Whether Btrade are a broker or exchange doesn't really matter if the high volume traders using their service all get hit up for 10% of their sales revenue. The law at this point favours low volume traders (they don't need to register for GST), which is great for decentralisation but not so great for liquidity.

Yes, it plugs into the USB port of your computer.


The Ledger Nano S doesn't need to know anything except your private keys. Your computer communicates with the Ledger but in a way that doesn't expose the private key.


It uses a fresh Bitcoin address for each receiving transaction. If you spend all your funds at once, the privacy is weakened as anyone looking at the blockchain will know all those addresses are controlled by one person.
Using Bitcoin anonymously is not trivial. If privacy is important to you, learn more about inputs/outputs/ change addresses and have a look at r/joinmarket or r/monero (altcoin).

Bitcoin is so far from being a Ponzi. A Ponzi must have an element of dishonesty. Some proponents of Bitcoin may be dishonest and lie about the opportunities, but the majority are honest.
The vast majority holding bitcoins are not waiting to cash out for 'real money', they're hodling because they found real money.
If most people are using it as an investment then it's an investment. However this investment has the potential to be converted into a lot more currency in several years.
Like how people who invested in real estate decades ago now have a lot of currency.

Whether or not KYC is in or outside the chain is irrelevant because Bitcoin fungibility breaks down when you have approved transactions and suspicious transactions.

Not necessarily to check the balance as once you know the address it generates you can easily copy it. But to confirm any transaction, yes needs to be plugged in

It’s not such a ridiculous nor untrue statement. Replace the word ‘inflation’ with the words ‘quantitative easing’ and it holds true the inflation that will occur under the traditional system will be more unpredictable than the bitcoin system.
Currency manipulation may be a necessary evil to achieve growth but at least now people have the choice to opt for an alternative that doesn’t harm savers/retirees and people who don’t like the growth that the traditional system encourages.

People don't communicate at the speed of optic fibre, we're still human and people's values (particularly around money) change slowly over time. Anyone who has been holding Bitcoin for a number of years has likely outperformed the fiat markets.
People are starting to take interest in Bitcoin, and not everyone here is a troglodyte. I just held a Bitcoin Meetup and I can attest that people see the opportunity and adoption is happening, slowly but surely.

Conflict is such a broad term it probably effects Bitcoin both ways depending on the kind.
Cyberwarfare could increase demand for Bitcoin by governments and corps for example, but it could also hurt the public's perception of it.
The strength depends on decentralisation more than anything so public perception is more valuable than big money interest. Thus, I think conflict is bad for Bitcoin.

The reality is that Bitcoin has been a better investment on most days. People who buy in at the top expecting easy gains can't win every time.

What others say about checking the screen is good advice, however if your web browser is comprised, there's every chance that the Bitcoin addresses have been replaced with the hacker's Bitcoin addresses, in which case there's nothing a hardware wallet can do to help you realise this.

People who run electrum nodes would either give the user a choice or decide for them. They could push an update that allowed users to choose which chain they would like to subscribe to. Hopefully we will have a clear consensus though as it's a pretty confusing decision for the average user.

Possibly, though I think it would be harder to argue that Bitcoin is a currency.


While they share some similarities (anonymity, good as gold, banks don't like to deal with them) the laws for bearer bonds are hundreds of years old and it would be a big stretch for the government to argue they apply to a 6 year old digital currency. 
What's more likely is they will create new laws to encompass Bitcoin into the AML legal framework and put a new category on the customs forms.

If I didn't invest bitcoins a few years ago I'd be a millionaire. Gigamining, Neo&amp;Bee and ASICMINER all turned to shit eventually. Even getting the first Avalon turned out to be a bad investment compared to just holding bitcoins.
Investing in Bitcoin is risky enough, but if you must take on more risk, the house edge for just dice or prime dice might be your best bet.
Or you can save your bitcoins and make investments with your time.

If I were the seller I would just not send the bitcoins until you hand over the money.
I'm assuming you initiated the trade but normally the initiator of the trade gives first. Local bitcoins website has a whole guide to running a cash exchange.
Also the cash needs to be verified to be authentic, so you can imagine how awkward it would be if your seller has given you his coins and then decides he doesn't accept your cash.

The kind of financial privacy that monetary regulations require are not the kind that would allow every transaction to be publicly broadcasted.
HIPAA in the US only applies to health services. 
Sec regulations if they ever apply to bitcoins will certainly not aim to protect Bitcoin's inherent pseudo-anonymity.
Sec regulates investment products and companies, Bitcoin not falling into either category.

Yes, profession might be 'Bitcoin trader'.


Suspicious activity reports are filed when there's a suspicion of crime.  If there were no discernible business activity then yes, it would look like money laundering.
But the first paragraph of the article reads:


Bitcoin trading is not illegal in Australia. It's not covered under the AML/KYC legislation and the banks are refusing accounts based on who they decide are conscientious Bitcoin traders.
Leaving the banks to decide who can have accounts (who's a conscientious Bitcoin trader) and who can't, with no legislation to provide everyone with a clear framework of requirements to trade Bitcoin only stands to further monopolise the banks.

[Here's a quick primer]( but it comes down to regulations are written laws that everyone should know whereas policy is unwritten laws that are meant as guidance and is open to interpretation.

A. Currency Name
B. Country
So which country exactly is the Bitcoin currency from?

How much time did you waste integrating credit card payments on your website? Do you spend even more money on verifying your customers to deal with fraudulent behaviour?
Well, accepting Bitcoin payments gives you advantages over credit cards of zero charge backs and less processing fees (typically 1% or under and in some cases completely free).

This Bill was amended four days ago, so I think this *is* something new and worth discussing.
That definition of money transmission services is poorly worded because it can be ambiguously interpreted. Both conditions are joined with the word 'and' but it's not clear if it's an inclusive or exclusive 'and'.
I don't see how it relates to the activities of a virtual currency business who are selling property as far as the IRS is concerned. The Money Transmission Act is mentioned in this bill twice but a sufficient connection to the operations of virtual currency business are not made.
Applying badly worded money transmission regulation to Bitcoin is not the best regulation, IMO. It's how regulatory creep happens and you can bet that the laws will be unfairly used against people doing trades under 10k. Note how there is no mention of limits in the bill.
The intent of the bill is clear, Bitcoin exchanges can only be run by wealthy people. This is unfair and discriminatory. While it might incentivise honest Bitcoin exchange operations, I think the benefits will be outweighed by the decreased competition.

Really? I just spent the last 2 hours reviewing the Silk Road transcripts and couldn't find any mention of Bitcoin private keys being interpreted as monetary instruments or bearer instruments. A bearer instrument is substantially different to a Bitcoin private key because there is no underlying property:




I went to law school in Australia where the [Treasury has ruled that Bitcoin is not money or a negotiable/bearer instrument]( Naturally different countries will each have their own interpretation when it comes to whether or not Bitcoin fits the definition of money. However, in the case of the US the spirit of the law and intention to allow for Bitcoin to be a monetary instrument was not entertained at the time the law was written.










I don't recall you giving me any evidence that the Court's view on Bitcoin private keys is that they are monetary instruments. Can you show me where the Court stated this?


Really? Where?




Have you read the transcripts between DPR and the agents? It reads like a bad script. Not to mention, entrapment, denial of evidence relating to the involved agents corruption, complete lack of evidence on where 4/5ths of the bitcoins generated by the site went, failure to produce evidence of the server seizure and the forensic analysis on the running processes bungle. There was certainly enough reasonable doubt though it seems the jury was duped.


Again, allegedly.

We're talking about the lack of any laws in America that classify Bitcoin as currency.


It's really beside the point what the intention in the judges'/politicians' minds was when they wrote the law. They wrote the law and it is what it is. If they intend on adding Bitcoin to the list of goods to declare then so be it, but it's not on the list today.




That customs agents have no place asking people if they have any bitcoins.

I have been to law school and the issues he is appealing are far from straightforward. I fully expect his sentence will be reduced within the next 5 years.

Here in Australia we don't have MSB licences, but we do have a remittance company/business register. If you're an Australian Bitcoin trading company there is no way they will grant you a licence because Bitcoin is not regulated by the money laundering authority (AUSTRAC) yet. The reason given by the bank for refusing an account based on (EDIT) reputational risk and Bitcoin businesses not doing due diligence is bullshit because we're not even allowed to as it would break privacy laws. You can't just ask to take a copy of someone's ID unless the law specifically requires it and currently it doesn't.

Maybe I'm wrong about US laws not applying to Australian banks, however there's still nothing in the Bank Secrecy Act that says banks need a full payment trail.
From what I've seen so far, a record of the customer's name, address and source of funds is the minimum standard for information required.

You're right, generally consumers paying with Bitcoin don't need to worry about reporting Bitcoin transactions.




However the wording of 'cost of the bitcoin' is ambiguous IMO. These questions come to mind:
* Does it mean the cost of one bitcoin at time of purchase?
* If the value of bought bitcoins increase to over $10,000 does that change anything?
* If you purchase Bitcoin regularly and accrue more than $10,000 worth does the reporting exemption not apply to  purchases anymore?

I struggled with this diagram for many months upon first learning about Bitcoin. Here's my attempt to explain it:
To explain the diagram your teacher needs to understand what a hash is. Quite simply a hash is the result of a maths formula that turn any amount of data into a fixed length string of numbers and letters. Now that you’re teacher has this piece of knowledge they can proceed to understand the diagram.
Explain the concepts of blocks and the block chain briefly. Something like: In the beginning there was a Genesis block of transactions and every 10 minutes there is another block that’s added to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks.
Cover the 2 blocks to the right and focus on explaining public/private key crypto.
As you can see from the diagram the previous transaction is combined with the public key (which is mathematically linked to the receiver’s bitcoin address) and then hashed.
This hashing is done so that the receiver of the transaction can verify it really did come from the sender’s address and that the ledger has not been fraudulently altered. It can be mathematically proven easily by computing the hash independently.
Of course the Bitcoin client software does the checking automatically, but the theory is sound.

The industry doesn't want a whole new regulatory framework. All we want is for digital currencies to be treated  like foreign currencies for the purposes of integrating Bitcoin into the existing legal system.
This creates the least amount of work for the ATO, solves the GST issue and brings Bitcoin exchanges under the purview of AUSTRAC.
This should not be a long process. We need a bill to over turn the ATO's interpretation. Every day that the GST ruling remains unchallenged increases the premium to buy bitcoins  in Australia and reduces the use cases for Bitcoin in retail and remittance.

Bitcoin suffers from a fundamental flaw, which is also the basis for its existence: it is fundamentally deflationary. To make a long story short, Bitcoin operates by allowing miners to produce new coins by using the work of decryption to control the rate at which new coins are issued. The total number of coins that can be issued is fixed, meaning that Bitcoin is deflationary, and more akin to a ponzi scheme than an actual currency.
The amount of gold on this earth is finite and so it's deflationary - that doesn't make gold a Ponzi.




Anything with value depends on the faith of its users.


Mining coins has absolutely nothing to do with the transfer of wealth from early adopters to late adopters.
Appreciation in value is due to supply and demand.


The same statement can be said for anything with value. There is no inherent tendency towards appreciation.


Bitcoin had a huge bubble so it's normal the price has been in a bear market since. Your conclusion that this slow decline is a crash and somehow linked to deflation and has some sort of natural directional tendency in value lacks basis.


Over [100,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin]( and you presume it's never been much of a medium of exchange? The price has more than doubled since that news was made. Any techno-libertarian smart enough to pay attention back then would be well in the money today.


Deflation also encourages saving, which means people buy less crap and only spend when they really need to - which translates into the market making better quality products and competing for people's savings.




The same argument that Bitcoin would be shut down by the government if it gains traction was made often in the early days of Bitcoin. The governments understand they can't control it, so they have no choice to let it exist. To say that governments allow it to exist because of its failures is disingenuous.


You've missed the point about Bitcoin. It is not meant to resemble regular money, nor expand and contract in supply according to the subjective interpretations of a few masterminds.


Once again, you've missed the point about crypto-currency - we're not all here saying everyone needs to use Bitcoin. People should have the freedom to choose which currencies to use.


These are problems that apply to currencies which rely on demand/supply human-made decisions which don't apply to crypto-currencies.


What exactly is the Fed supposed to do?


There are already several different crypto-currencies to choose from. Why not just choose one that is not as deflationary as Bitcoin if you're so averse to deflation? There are many which have a dis-inflationary supply model.

Sending a news alert and then presuming its content is used to steal personal information is not very different from restricting speech.
It's a subtle form of censorship because they are presenting the view that Bitcoin is linked with malicious behaviour. While there is a connection, Google's algorithm could be much better at detecting malicious behaviour and when you sign up for a news alert service you might expect Google to not serve you malicious links as the news for whichever topic you subscribe for.

Let's say market price of one bitcoin to AUD is $300. You buy 1 bitcoin $330.
This is the first 10% GST you pay.
You then buy a coffee using some of that bitcoin for $4.40 AUD (which has *another* 10% GST component factored into the price).
This is the normal 10% tax everybody in Australia pays, but you already paid GST on the purchase of bitcoins making your coffee 10% *more* expensive than people paying with cash. Effectively 20% tax where the tax should only be 10%.

Your placing your money that's at the whim of a centrally managed institution, a board room of people in executive positions at the credit union. This structure is not sufficiently different enough from a bank that you should feel at ease.
Granted, by placing your money in Bitcoin you're also trusting a small group of people, but this group is more spread out and the miners have an incentive to not screw everyone over.
While your credit card company isn't taking bailout money, it's taking your merchants money, resulting in you paying at inflated prices. If you paid in bitcoin, you should get a discount.

The crux of their argument is that Bitcoin is not a currency of any country.




which I don't think is a great argument, because Bitcoin is already being used by people in many countries (albeit at a small scale).
The definition does not define 'or' as an 'exclusive or' or a 'mutually inclusive or'.


If Australian Bitcoin brokers have to charge 10% on the price of Bitcoin, then there's no Bitcoin exchange industry in Australia, simple.
Australians buying bitcoins need to buy where the liquidity is (overseas), which increases their reliance on bank services for wire transfers.
Banks are protected from GST by the ATO because financial services are "input-taxed", which means that GST is not charged on the sale.

The Australian Senate is meeting next month to discuss Bitcoin, tax and regulation. As a result of my action we will have around 300 signatures to present, all of them with comments about the ATO's position.
I stand by my petition as a starting point for change and this renewed interest from the community has inspired me to follow through with it, provide updates and encourage the people who signed it to share, call their local politicians, media and generally make some noise.
Some people asked me when I started it, 'Why bother? You're not going to change anything.' I must have made the mistake of being easily discouraged back then. Well, this issue is still important to me now so this time round I'm actually going to do something about it.

This is more or less what I said.


You're confusing two separate issues. I'm talking about individuals buying bitcoins. This is the group of people in Australia who are most affected.


Again, this is a fringe scenario of a Bitcoin accepting retail business. Also, he doesn't need receipts, he has the blockchain.
but I still think he would have a case with the ATO that tax has been paid on them, and so can deduct it from the final taxes he pays...
This should also create a situation where less tax is paid than if the ATO declares that no GST is paid on bitcoin.
Unless the GST on Bitcoin brokers in Australia is dropped, there's not going to be a lot of taxes collected from Bitcoin sales in Australia.

They see it as an intangible asset. 


The GST is supposed to be a tax on consumption paid by consumers. It makes no sense at all to levy it on investments as it makes them too expensive to invest in. 
Also barter transactions generally go untaxed because of their low value. Anyone collecting GST needs to have 75k annual business turnover, register for GST and submit quarterly business activity statements. 


GST is a consumer tax and the ATO are treating bitcoins like a consumer good, even though they admit Bitcoin is not a goods. ATO have already said that business to business Bitcoin transactions will be entitled to claim GST credits back. This area is not the focus of my petition.
 


No, not unless your in the car dealing business turning over 75k revenue per year. 


 Yes, that's why the GST is quite the unpopular tax.

To back a local currency with Bitcoin is an educational and technological recipe for disaster. Many merchants will likely get cheated if they believe they can trust the local currency in place of accepting bitcoins directly. 
Unless you can design the local currency in such a way that counterfeiting is very expensive, it could be a better use of your time to work on an educational campaign on how to use Bitcoin safely IMHO.

Banks are gambling with your wealth keeping just a fraction in reserve, they're rewarding you with a pittance.
The central bank is also taking your wealth, devaluing your balance by conjuring virtual dollars and giving them directly to your bank to encourage rampant speculation.
Taxpayers also will have wealth taken by more and higher taxes when banks start to freeze. This is to reduce the inflationary burden on central banks to make everyone that kept money in the banks whole.
Combined wealth stealing of banks will mean less jobs and higher defaults on loans leading to lower asset prices, lower trust levels and greater wealth disparities.

This is not a good move imo. I had to sign up to Xapo to play [Bitquest]( - the Bitcoin Minecraft server that pays you bitcoins to play. Then Xapp upgraded their AML compliance.
I had to give them my home address, verify my mobile, tell them my passport number and source of the funds.
All for 22 cents.
And after all of that, there was an error in the verification process. I clicked on a link that was supposed to offer help about the error and I then got a page not found error.
So Xapo still has my 22 cents and I can't send it.

I don't think it would work. The ATO are pretty specific about allowable deductions and if you can't prove there were unclaimed GST then you wouldn't have a strong case.
You could however ask your customers if they paid GST on their bitcoins when they go to pay, then tag your receiving addresses on blockchain.info with notes like GST amount of $X AUD included in this transaction (you would need to ask how much GST they paid when they bought them because of the volatility). Then if the ATO has a problem with double claims it could be resolved easily.
In practice though I can't see this happening very often.

Any Australian business selling bitcoins needs to charge 10% Goods and Services Tax on the value of the Bitcoin. GST is levied on most goods and services in Australia. So when Australians who bought bitcoins from Australian Bitcoin traders or brokers go buy something in Australia, they're paying two sets of GST.

Yes, Goods and Services Tax and income tax (AKA Capital Gains Tax).

Even more so if the merchant doesn't bother to respond to the sale for over a month and then adds international shipping to the cost and refused any refund or compensation whatsoever (like the CryptoAnarchy store), or Butterfly Labs ignoring request for refund abd sending it anyway.
