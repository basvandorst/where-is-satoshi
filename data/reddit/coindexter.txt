Hear hear: even if Gox could prove without a shadow of a doubt that the coins belonged to them, and even if it would put an end to all this debacle,  and even if it would satisfy those who lost coins, I still don't want to see this happen. Such an agreement would seriously damage my respect for the protocol. I feel bad for those who lost money on Gox (could have happened to anyone), but not bad enough that I want bitcoin "exceptions"  to be made.

I read this comment a lot,  but how is this actually done? I mean I understand the concept of live CDs,  but with an offline computer, how do you get the software to generate the addresses? Sooner or later don't you have to connect to the net? Download from bitadress? Download the install files for a client etc? And by doing this don't you need to trust the code/connection? 
Even with an offline computer and a jump drive, there is still a breadcrumb trail leading back to some Internet service/provider,  right? Can addresses be generated completely offline? How?

I can't even imagine using Coinbase as a day-trading platform. I usually wait for an ACH to clear before I buy and sell there. I don't like having an open ACH transfer before initiating another. My bank would probably go bonkers if I tried to day-trade with my checking account. All that ACH pushing &amp;  pulling in a single day, sometimes in the space of one hour! Do people really do this? They have to realize that true exchanges exist for the same reason brokerage accounts exist. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:45:16
I'll elaborate, since I like Coinbase and I've never had any problems with their service. 
Every time you buy or sell on Coinbase, you initiate an ACH transfer. These ACH transfers (since they were invented by dinosaurs) take 3-7 days to complete. And many traditional banks post limits on the amount of ACH transfers you can have in a day/week/month. Too many and your bank activity will be flagged as suspicious, your funds may even be frozen. 
Day-trading is an active hobby. Those who trade often do so several times a day. With traditional stocks, a trader usually keeps a brokerage account in order to limit ACH usage in his primary checking. Brokerage accounts are not usually insured. 
In the world of bitcoin, trade exchanges like Bitstamp and Mt. Gox function similarly to brokerage accounts. They are non-insured hot wallets that allow you to quickly trade fiat for btc without having to initiate several ACH transfers a day. You fund the exchange and they hold and track your money until you are ready to cash out. 
I think many people have trouble with Coinbase because they try to use it as an exchange. Let's say you buy a bitcoin on Coinbase at 7 a.m., then the price skyrockets, so you sell at noon. Another dip and you buy back in a 3 p.m. You've made quite a bit of money,  right? Yes and no. You've just initiated three ACH transfers from the same company to your checking account in the space of a single day. You did the same thing yesterday and your funds haven't even cleared yet. 
When your bank sees this sort of activity, they immediately become suspicious and freeze your account. So the money you've "made" is lost because Coinbase (rightfully) flagged your account as high risk. Now your fucked. Coinbase is fucked too. Because a potential customer's money is no longer flowing. 
It's best to think of Coinbase as a retail outlet that let's you buy coins,  which you can either use to buy product or transfer somewhere else for trading. The safest way to use their service is to make a transaction,  then wait (like a dinosaur) for the ACH to clear before initiating another transaction. Coinbase is not an exchange. Those who use it at such put both themselves and the company at risk. I would argue that you also put the entire bitcoin protocol at risk, since you make the banks hate us even more than they already do. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:27:54
You looked around and decided to go with Mt. Gox as your exchange? Where did you look,  2010?
But seriously, if you want those coins, your going to have to verify. Even then you might not see them. Mt. Gox has serious liquidity problem for both BTC and USD. I feel for you. They've got some of my coins too :(

What's worrisome is that whenever a government or organization wants to demonize something, they can turn upon this red herring. It's the same argument they used to try to bring down P2P, torrents, and other disruptive technologies. It's a boring argument that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny, because it's an appeal to emotion ([argumentum ad passiones]( This kind of thinking is damaging to the human condition - allowing subjective considerations to influence, and ultimately trump reason. The phrase "save the children" promotes a visceral feeling that presents a perspective claiming to be superior to reason. No sane person could promote child abuse, so whatever can be associated with child abuse must be insane (no matter how specious the association).
When the facts are not in one's favor, there is a tendency to want to use emotions to sway the opinion of the masses. Politicians do this because it works. Because the herd doesn't think logically. Not yet anyway. If they did, they would realize that this line of thinking is a downward spiral. 
Just about anything can be linked to this ugly red herring. Why not say that email itself is pernicious, because people use it to send illegal materials? For that matter, the internet itself is an evil force. So must we blame the technology, not the user?
Consider the recent leak concerning the invasion of privacy perpetrated on the American public. Now we're certain to see more and more appeals of this kind. The government will use whatever it can to further its agenda: whether those false appeals relate to terrorism, or child pornography, or Emmanuel Goldstein. So long as those in power can keep their underlings looking another way -- not looking too closely at the validity of their claims -- they can maintain *their* staus quo. 
It's a disgusting manipulation by people who certainly know what they are doing.
Who cares if Bitcoin can be linked to child porn? What does it really matter? The government needs to be going after producers of evil, not the network of propagation. Because if they manage to bring down Bitcoin, the child pornographers will only find another means to pay for their jollies. They'll keep creating smut, they'll keep trading it, and they'll keep abusing innocents. 
This argument is not about saving the children; it's about using the children. It's about using people's emotions to further their agenda. They couldn't care less about protecting society from pornography. On the contrary, they care about protecting themselves from revolt. And they'll say whatever they have to in order to justify their equivocal, pestiferous actions.

I generated an invoice for you:
* Lexar 4GB Flash drive: $7
* Tails Live Distro: $0
* Ineptitude: $33
Seems like a fair price, because, when you think about it, 33 USD is pittance compared to the cost your customers will pay if they don't take the time to educate themselves on how to use Linux, how to update the software, and how to browse the internet anonymously. I'm sure you'll sell a lot of these, but to the feckless babes who assume that anonymity can actually be bought. 
Regrettably, it cannot: anonymity must be learned. It is the result of a culmination of technologies (Tor being but one) married to behavioral tenets. Your product promotes laziness and delinquency.
I wonder whether or not these pre-loaded anon sticks are good for society? Or whether they represent a great step backwards? 
It's an ethical dilemma that you, the seller, must ask yourself -- if the types of people who buy your stick are the same types who cannot climb the technical barrier, then are you really selling them anonymity? Or are you selling them an illusion? 
Personally I would feel bad handing someone a USB drive and telling them that they now have access to the anonymous internet. I would instead work to educate people on how to keep themselves safe -- by teaching them about encryption protocol, about alternatives to popular email and instant messaging, and about the security appended to Linux (compared to Windows, etc). I would tell them that anonymity cannot be bought for $40. It cannot be bought for $100. Instead it must be earned through diligence and desire. 
Of course there's no money to be made in telling people the truth. Which is why I suck at eBay.

It's big because it's been around the longest. Back in the day, it was the only way to trade. Plus most media outlets still report their price above all others. 
But it's been shit for some time now. Old players still use it because prices are high and they cross their fingers Gox will fix their issues. They hope to some day cash out at a premium (or what until very recently used to be a premium). Maybe that could happen. Maybe Gox will fix their issues. But I doubt it.

Bitcoin is not a religion. Satoshi is not a god. These comparisons are not only cringeworthy,  but ultimately bad for the bitcoin community as a whole.

**Edit: The below reply was written to OP before he decided to delete and rewrite his reply. I hate when people do this.**
You can try to backtrack and claim that your post is sarcasm, but I don't believe you. What I believe: you tried to create a humorous connection between religion and bitcoin (a stupid connection that others like you have already made). But your trite, juvenile attempt at humor failed to impress me and now you yell, SARCASM (not really understanding the meaning of the word). Regardless of whether or not you intended to be funny/sarcastic with your post, I find these sorts of comparisons insulting and damaging to the bitcoin community. A lot of everyday people already come to BTC with a fair amount skepticism and trepidation. Appearing like a religious fanatic who worships Satoshi doesn't help to legitimize the coin. You're not the first fool to do this, and you won't be the last. In my heart I wish that people with your so-called sense of humor would just keep quiet. I don't want religion in my wallet. Not even in jest.

I've said this in a previous post,  but bitcoin users really need a proper accounting software similar to Quicken or YNAB. There are a lot of users who keep their coins spread about multiple wallets and hot/cold addresses,  and it would be nice to have a record of all debits and credits (not only to track your investing,  but also because records are necessary come tax season if you decide to cash out on top). BTC needs an equivalent to YNAB,  but with the ability to add more than two decimal places and maybe a live exchange rate. Toshl tried but their service lacks the proper formatting.
