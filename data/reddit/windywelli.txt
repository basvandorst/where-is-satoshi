I hate to play devils advocate, but maybe it's more of a reflection of the scale Bitcoin has reached?
I mean, look at it this way:
Bitcoins market cap is close to a quarter of a trillion US dollars.
$233 billion, to be precise.
So, while this is a lot of money that's gone missing, and it's completely deplorable, it's only 0.026% of the total market cap.
Point is, there may well have been a time where this was unthinkable, but as of the last 6 months, it'd be understandable if the collective sense of scale had shifted a few 'commas'.

I'm with you, I see it now. He's fucking hilarious. He's the kind of guy that would have never been entertained 5~ years ago, but now that he's made calls worth billions, he's given screen time. Beautiful.

Unlikely - there are less disruptive/smarter ways to do this if you wanted to go down that route, in my humble opinion.

Granted, and without getting into a debate around whether or not the pump is ridiculous, I think my point still holds - I mean, divide the market cap by 2 if you want to. Divide it by 4 if needs be. The amount that's just been stolen is still relatively insignificant given our new frame of reference for 'big scandal'.

Thank-you for all the amazing work you've done, all the best.
