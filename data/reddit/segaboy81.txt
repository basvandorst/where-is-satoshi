I just sold the BTC I put in there before I start losing it. Maybe Coincube can figure it all out now that I'm all cash.

I hope not, because I've been HODLING for 4 years. Everyone thinks I'm crazy.

I should also mention that the first trade it did for me was buy

As Bitcoin becomes more scarce, its value will continue to go up (so long as it stays relevant). Who will want to invest in local currency loans if Bitcoin is lost each time? When Bitcoin is stable, your service makes a lot of sense. When it is volatile, it makes no sense for investors.

I think you just get screwed, and that debtor gets a lower rating. Funny thing here, the loans I have invested in (against US dollar) have lost me money because of the rise in BTC vaule. Thus, I just take out loans. I only owe the USD value at maturation, so as long as BTC is going up, I can outrun the interest and make money. Now if BTC tanks, I'll be screwed...

Sure. The last loan I invested in, I make no money... Bitcoin value keeps going up, but the borrower only owes me the USD equivalent. BTC is what has the real value, so my best investment is to take out loans for myself when I feel like BTC is going up!  Example: I take out a loan for $200. BTC is worth $500 at the beginning, but is worth $700 at the end. I only owe $200 worth of BTC, thus I GAIN BTC.

In April, I took a 6 week loan for .5 BTC. 6 weeks later I repaid the loan @ .41 BTC. This means I made .09 BTC.

Correctly? lol. I see what you're trying to say though.

I would have to withdraw 401k funds to recover the loss. In 2014, I took out a small 401k loan to buy something important for my house. Instead, I bought Bitcoin first, which worked out extraordinarily well!

If the scaling problem results in a hard fork, I'll have coins on two networks... But who really knows how this will play out.

I've been hodling since $30...
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:18:28
Right... But how to you charge against an inverse BTC USD tether when fiat is how BTC value is measured? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:11:05
Yes, but my question is how do you do it? Paper certificates for BTC? I'm familiar with paper wallets, but that doesn't sound like what you're talking about... Please, elaborate. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:58:38
I cant believe I let you troll for this long... Please don't spread this FUD around... 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:16:36
Who offers you this service?  ??  ?? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:24:55
How exactly do you do that? What do you use as an inverse tether to get this number? I don't understand.

Seriously Coinbase is so greedy it can't hire enough people to cover the support demand.
I haven't been able to login to my phone for over a month...

Update: I didn't do this, but given the timing of this post, I should have!
