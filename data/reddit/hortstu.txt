So what? The dollar can be divided more and more if it became more valuable too. We used to have a half penny and we could go smaller if there was something worth trading for a hundredth of a penny. The divisibility doesn't change the impact of deflation in the population. 
Of course none of this matters unless bitcoin became the reserve currency and that's not going to happen.

please stop it with the "bams" they're especially annoying when you don't prove anything.
the same could be said about digital dollars. They're also infinitely divisible. That didn't make deflation any less of a problem. If you think it does please explain how.

Bitcoin, as a reserve currency, would be a bigger problem than the dollar. It isn't capable of expanding fast enough to keep up with the potential demand and this would result in more deflation than we're subjected to with the dollar. Deflation was a major issue during the great depression and could be an issue in the future. 
 As a means of trade it is useful, at least until it's integrity is compromised by counterfeiters. I look at bitcoin as a digital form of gold or a volatile investment but it lacks some characteristics of a currency. In many ways it is better than the dollar. At least the Fed isn't getting a cut out of it.

He doesn't want to hear that the digital dollar is as divisible as bitcoin.  It's all he's got to stand on in this deflation argument.

I'll agree with the part about bankster elites but since they are mostly  to blame for deflationary situations I think it's more like they don't mind deflation, they just don't like the terms that suit deflation.

if you want to discuss this logically lets stay within logic and reason let's do so. Reserve currency is and will be a reality until it isn't. The fact that some people deal with digital currencies, stocks, metals, whatever doesn't make reserve currency go away.

he's legit.

by expanding on don't mean infinitely divisible. All currencies are infinitely divisible via minting coins, printing paper, or moving ones zeros and decimal points around on a computer.

then why didn't the terms change to take advantage of the deflationary economy during the depression?

Very good analogy. I'd also like to add that your analogy assumes/ sounds like everyone knows deflation is coming before they borrow.  Most people don't even know what deflation is or its impact on real life.  Americans haven't experienced real deflation since the great depression so for the most part we're ignorant to the ramifications of it.
If Joe takes out a 30 yr home loan 10 years before deflation strikes he's already locked in and now looking at a losing proposition for the next 20 years. Plus what he thought was a good investment for the last ten years just blew up in his face. 
 So Joe thought he was buying a house that was worth ten box tops.
He planned to pay 30 box tops for it over 30 years.
He hoped it would be worth 50-100 box tops when he paid it off.
Due to deflation it will only be with 5 box tops.
So elf, how does infinitely divisible bit coins help Joe? the fact that my dollar can be broken into 1000 parts instead of 100 wouldn't make me feel any better.
