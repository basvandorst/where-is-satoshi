Always do your own research, afaik coinmarketcap take averages of all major exchanges when do their pricing. It's not an exchange, there's no incentive for them to cheat, if you are not sure about a coin's price, always double check with another exchange which has that coin listed with volume.

Never used Nano legder s, but I assume it gives you multiple addresses and you did an tx from ledger address A to exchange address B. You couldn't do another transaction from the old address A (which's tx got stuck) because after the transaction A should be empty and the change should go to another address C unless you manually set the A as the "change address" (which you can do with core, again don't know about leger). With 0 balance you can't do a double spending. You need first transfer more fund into A, and then just do another transaction with any amount and higher fees to B(has to be the same as the stuck one) from A, miners have to confirm the stuck one in order to get the higher fee from the new tx, which will get both confirmed.

It means wall street is trying to control the price of bitcoin.

b2x and bch are attacks on btc in order to break its governance model which will destroy bitcoin. ethereum has a different goal than bitcoin, has a different set of supporters and developers.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:30:49
any data to deny my claim? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:36:39
Sure, and you would lockin 200 btc just in order to sell the shitcoin early? 200 btc doesn't make you smart.
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:09:59
"Jihan is trying to commandeer Bitcoin to be honest", very good joke.
Seems like people have really short memory, does the word ASICBoost ring any bells? Jihan Wu is not even a technical guy, the fuck he gives about keeping Bitcoin honest.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:03:25
look all those downvoters, student loans must fucked up lots of americans.
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:20:42
hahaha, right, such a heavy burden. here's a hint, whose Jihan's investors? Chinese Banks. Who owns Chinese banks? Well probably not some clueless westerners.
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:33:57
Just think what would you do if you have 200 btc.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:09:13
you win, well written.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:09:49
LOL, falsified by what? Like you know Chinese government that well? Are you are a communist party member? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:35:32
next one, antshare
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:24:53
No thank you my logic is fine and good luck on your student loan I rather use that money to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:04:43
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:07:01
right, ppl own 200 btc probably won't be around here.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:32:21
Exchanges will list anything as long as they get paid, it's up to the traders/users to choose whether adopt it or not.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:14:32
full of bs, you can invest in almost anything you want in China, most large SOE are listed on the stock market, THEY DON'T MAKING MONEY! 
And oil? are you kidding me?
Why I argue with you, you clearly have no idea on investment or China. Say whatever you want.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:07:42
That's the problem, on other exchanges are doing this.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:34:09
The reason bitcoin and crypto havent gone mainstream is there are still too many clueless people like you who try to rationalize the chaos without any computer science knowledge. The community will respect you but you need to read some wikipedia before you talk.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:36:31
And the real estate market isn't the same? who controls the supply? who controls the demand? how about all the debts? give me a break, it's all bubbles, and it's gonna burst, and it's going to be far more catastrophic because it's not a free market. I'm born in China btw.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:11:47
Then what's your point? No one would do that as long as he's not Roger Ver or a fool.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:54:33
From my experiences, tons of ppl use cyptos to move money from monetary restricted country like China to other countries. Even in the states, crypto transactions are way cheaper than bank wiring fees.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:40:48
So they are going to support both chains? (if it happens)
@_date: 2017-07-15 06:50:23
Jihan Wu has already made his money, he doesn't need Bitcoin to success further. 
Jihan Wu and Bitmain is backed by the Chinese government.
Chinese government / CCP wants to break the crypto currency as a whole so they can continue controlling the money flow and print more RMB to fool Chinese people without blowing Chinese economy up.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:58:34
Let's say the total market cap is still at 100 billion, meanwhile NYSE was at 14 trillion and Nasdaq was at 5 trillion in 2012, now maybe more, i'm lazy to check. Which means the crypto cap only worth 1/140 of nyse or 1/50 of nasdaq. Not to mention the underlying technology(blockchain) continuing to attract more developers, businesses, and governments in an accelerated paced. Early adopters don't have enough capitals to form a bubble, you need to look at the bigger picture.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:12:56

I don't need to proof shit, believe it or not, i'm not responsible for your ignorance.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:45:14
I don't think he had to mention "litecoin". Pretty manipulative words imo.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:48:14
It's not about "taking credit", it's programing, name matters.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:19:14
Don't feed the scam, what they are doing is getting ppl to sell bcc and get their bitcoins locked in, that increases the volume and bring a fake demand while everyone just only sells
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:10:10
That's my point, no one would do that, except trolls
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:16:46
Obama or Shillary wouldn't do that? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:37:35
That's why Chinese government is operating bitmain to break bitcoin and maybe the whole crypto market.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:42:43
lol, im not paranoid at all and when it comes to how Chinese government deals with private companies you are the one who talks shit.
Remeber how google got forced out of mainland market? remember how they ask apple to provide ios source code "in order to protect national security"? these are just US companies.  
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:56:13
right, and now BCC is heading to 0$, do the math, would you?
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:05:50
Did I hurt your feeling? I'm not sorry tho, I laugh at fools like you. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:08:57
Reaching a consensus by manipulating the rule isn't real consensus.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:21:53
wow, why havent you given them to viabtc then? I don't own any btc btw. ;P
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:49:10
Then you will see a ton of empty blocks(side products of asicboost). asicboost = cheating.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:46:21
it doesn't exist and it won't exist like, ever. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:49:43
glad we come to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:23:15


No I'm Chinese, so what? I was quoting your own words.
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:57:52
It's a scam, eveyone realized that. If that shit coin ever going to happen, then there's nothing wrong to sell after the hard fork to finish. No one will trust your stupid one-way trading "Exchange". Just like no one trusts that ass fucked fool Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:41:03
Bitmain is not the opposition, they are cheaters, you got your definition wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:35:56
So what? It "works" for you doesn't mean it's not a scam.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:16:06
Don't feed the scam, what they are doing is getting ppl to sell bcc and get their bitcoins locked in, that increases the volume and bring a fake demand while everyone just only sells
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:36:19


really? how will a bunch of jobless frustrated country men keep the real estate price up?
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:42:00
oh i will sell the bitmain shit coins once hf finished trust me.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:45:14
Definite not everyone, a large part of the users use bitcoin in real world transactions every day, that's how it gained its value in the 1st place.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:19:22
A business like Bitmain won't be able to exist in China if no involvement with the government support and manipulation. Bitcoin and blockchain technology will destroy the government censorship and monetary restriction effort. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:30:40
Selfish miners who think ASICBOOST will keep them in advance should wake up, they are puppets and slaves to Jihan Wu and Bitmain. How could such a dishonest guy still gain support I have no idea, they don't care if Bitcoin fails, they already made the money, they are betting with miners future with their "hard fork". Miners short sight is killing their livelihood.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:24:50
LOL, talking about empty promises...
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:39:51
Not this sub, I meant this thread, of cuz rich ppl digg reddit, lots of core devs are here too.
@_date: 2017-07-15 06:14:33
Your statement is not logical at all.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:30:09
I call scam
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:50:44
you dont say
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:27:01
I'm running the bip148 64bit version on ubuntu, those fee rate were manually set by me.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:55:21
Jihan Wu did not start from scratch. He was a hedge fund manager before bitcoin. He's just a greedy business man with no principles. Even in Chinese forums most miners/traders dislike him because of his dishonesty.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:36:20
I have to disagree with your statement entirely.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:40:06
Thanks, will do.
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:23:50
Funny how they just allow the new shit coin to be traded with CNY, so their secret buyers could pump the price up with Chinese unlimited fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:48:04
Just realise Viabtc is backing block size increasing hard fork and against sigwit, will my tx be included in their block since I signal bip148? lol this is getting funny.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:18:09
right, because we are suppose to pay more than 10% for small amount transactions, because bitcoin just don't care about small money anymore, "you pay too little", great answer btw.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:26:48
Update: submitted to viabtc's txacceleratot at 17:00 Jun 3 PST,
Lock time is well beyond so lets see if this thing works.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:06:44
that's 40 satoshi/byte, so I am aware of the tx size. Bitcoin should not only make sense technically but also economically, if it wants to survive.  
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:04:14
At least I can read, I said I'm not in a hurry, I don't even care if it got lost after whatever happens after Aug 1st.
Just to make a point, this shit state right now is fucked up.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:08:43
I'm using core and both tx have the same fee rate, so yeah maybe it's gonna be stuck like this for a while, ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:17:32
So now we are talking about actual rates now, well, if I put some physical cash from one of mine wallets to another wallet guess how much that costs? Maybe I'm stingy, I used to pay whatever fees those 3rd party wallets suggest when I started, sometime those fees even took half of the actual fund, I wasn't stingy then, was I?
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:45:38
I understand what you are saying, but by design bitcoin shouldn't be this costly. I'm going to wait this one out and see what's gonna happen on Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:38:38
Update update: confirmed Block 
viabtc accelerator rocks.
