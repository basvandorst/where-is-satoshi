It was 4 /1 in 2008-9.  The only question I worry about with adoption is storage solutions. It won't be used as a transactional currency any time in the near future because smartphone theft is rampant. However people purchasing as a store of value is possible, if they felt they could secure it safely. Many probably wouldn't trust their safe security options as a lot of technology is out of date due to import tax controls.

It ends stating that an Argentine version would work, and Odinsson is fairly wrong.  There is far too much theft for phones (most commonly owned device) in Argentina and a crypto being spread to everyone would only make that theft worse.  People wouldn't adopt it, and most stores wouldn't accept it as it would require having a device at the register to verify purchases.  Those phones or tablets or computers at the register would be too big of an easy target for theives.  Additionally There are too many tariffs on imported products to make the price of phones reasonable for the very poor.  They are unfortunately in a bad situation, and it is mostly the fault of the IMF and decades of corrupt governance.

A lot of people just want to hold their bitcoin, not necessarily spend it or in a quick hurry.  After reading that user's message below: Offer an option for delays on withdrawals. foreign IP blocks. And most importantly encourage the use of an external authentication such as email for withdrawals; 2FA looks the same on your phone for withdrawals as it does for logging in, why not offer both??!!

Don't take me as professional advice, but put 10% of your btc into doge and wait and see what happens.  If one hits it bigger than the other? You'll do just fine no matter what.  If one kills the other? You'll do just fine no matter what.
My personal opinion? You might get world regions using more of one or the other as a currency amongst day to day trades.  You also might get a situation where btc isn't traded nearly as much on the day to day, but ends up becoming a reserve electronic currency while folks are out there trading dogs for toothpaste and ltc to pay their electric bill.
In the end, doge pushed off really well because they played whose line is it anyway "The show where everything is made up and the points don't matter" long enough for the points to matter.  And they still tip and treat each other like the points don't matter.

I've spent time down there too.  20% isn't much when you look at the long-term: In 2008 it was around 4.25 pesos to the dollar, now it is 10.5 with dolar blue.
One of the best and simplest things that can be done to aid adoption is to convince dolarblue.net to add the btc exchange rate onto their site.  Also, can confirm that most Argentines use that site to determine exchange rates.
Edit: I take that back, I didn't realize they had added the btc exchange rate.

Almost none, argentines do not want to hold money that is specific to their country. Additionally for day to day purchases no one wants to use a smart phone, smartphone theft is rampant there.  Shop owners do not want to have one at their counter to get stolen and citizens do not want to bring their phone out every time they want to purchase something.
Using bitcoin as a store of value would be of interest to tech savvy Argentines.  Though many argentines don't have updated/quality/secure tech due to horrendous import tariffs and years of economic devaluation.  Their economy is teetering.

I think the meme was necessary for the initial thrust to get off the ground.  Now the community, the large number of low value coins, the fast transaction times, and the large user-base are what gives it value.  It won't overtake bitcoin, but it can pair nicely with it.

The Argentine currency has been slowly falling over the past few years.  Their government has instituted price controls on the US dollar, and yesterday their bank made a major readjustment.  use dolarblue.net to see the blue dollar that people pay on the street and the official dollar according to the banks.
It has changed dramatically since 2009 when it was just over 4 pesos to the dollar, and now when blue fetches you just under 12.  The government itself has large stockpiles of USD and for a long time was making it very difficult for Argentine citizens to store their money in foreign currencies.  At the moment there are government enforced price controls being extended to groceries and personal care items in the store, not sure how effective they are, I heard there was a TP shortage recently.
The thing of greater concern is that their economy has been held up by the price of soy over the past few years.  One of the things that kept the soy prices so high was crop failures in Russia one year, followed by corn failures in the US the following two years.
Argentine government has extremely high import tariffs on electronics, which essentially serves as a blockade to modern technology.  Yesterday someone posted that in one day their samsung phone went from 7k pesos to 11k pesos on mercadolibre (their craigslist/ebay hybrid) in one afternoon.  Speaking of phones, muggings are very high.  Over half of my Argentine friends have been mugged for their phones, some 2 or 3 times.  Most without taking their phones out in public places.
One really telling sign of the level of insecurity in the Argentine peso is the bus and boat terminals in Uruguay.  When you get to the Montevideo bus terminal from Buenos Aires, there are a row of atms that are loaded up with USD regularly for Argentines who keep their money across the river in secure Uruguayan banks.  When I was there, every single one of them was out of cash and I was assured that they were filled on all business days.
They joke about a 10 year crisis cycle, and on that logic they are overdue, but most of it has to do with a long history of corrupt politicians and some unfortunate loans that the IMF made to corrupt leaders that they never should have given money to.  Argentines have been paying for those for over 20 years now.

Not just awareness, lack of ability to get it.  Tech is too pricey to buy for mining  (costs of tech are often 2-3x the price for the same product in the states).

Thanks to both you and Ben for sticking it through the shitshow of drama that hits time and again. This information is pretty fucked up and hopefully as few people will be left shorthanded as possible. Ben put himself on the line batting against Moolah back in May and he kinda got ousted from the community.  Sure, he wasn't the most tactful at times, but who can blame him considering the anti-fud censorship attitude the sub adopted (and will hopefully purge) it was one of few ways to push light on a hostile to opposition environment. I am hoping pushes for positive growth and open discussion in much the same way the bitcoin community attempts. The fall of bad actors only makes crypto stronger- so it can be said ... That this is actually good news.

I think what we are witnessing is how a bank should go out of business (except for some transparency issues with GOX).
Basically, the funds are held securely for each member to transfer out, and trusted community members are assisting with the process to prevent fraud and loss on the part of the collapsing institution.
It is in every bitcoin user's interest that this collapse happens smoothly, fairly, and that everyone gets their btc back.  This is very different than how banks collapsed in 1929.
