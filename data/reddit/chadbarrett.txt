It’s because it leaked out that they are adding BCH so they had to announce it to stop the insider trading.

You actually don't send in your own rather just recruit existing employees in those spots. It's really common to just get an existing employee on the payroll.

Possibly... I just don't know how worth it is to have a trained and contracted agent in those locations with modern hacking.
I know how the Chinese always get the US companies is basically they just find an employee who's Chinese and who's family lives back in China. Then they basically offer to buy the family a house plus some extra pocket change for themselves. And all that's required is the person just needs to plug in a micro USB into their work computer. 
Then once infected the Chinese government just remotely accesses their network and get to work. I feel like it's just too risky to send in a full time employee who's also officially a spy

Not really, I gave away thousands when they were worth pennies on the dollar days after launch. I believed in the idea. Actually heard about it here on Reddit and thought it was cool. 
I'm not going to kick myself for being a college kid and selling each for a few bucks making thousands of dollars. It was a rational move. I literally spent pocket change to buy them and now made thousands. People would consider it stupid to NOT take 100x return on something...
The only thing I kick myself for is day trading and losing money by not being patient enough. I should have just set it and forget it. But that's sort of hard when you're a broke college kid and your portfolio is fluctuating by thousands a day.

Nah, he was just a huge moron. I'm very privvy of the details of what happened. He's just an all out completely incompetent idiot, through and through. The theft was assisted on the inside, and not ONCE did anyone catch on that the leak of coins was coming straight out of their hot wallet. It went on for years and the reported balance vs real balance was constantly dividing and he never once decided to change the hot wallets lol
The guy behind it was a well known BTC guy named Alexander... A russian who laundered it all through BTCe

Not really, think of all the people who bought in at 1k then just now sold at 10k... That's a huge 10x increase. Well, my increase was 100x up to nearly 1000x. Sure, could have been more, but investment-wise, it was a smart move. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:42
Oh there has been a lot of movement on that front, but unfortunately the coins themselves are probably long gone. A Russian guy was caught laundering the stolen bitcoins, at least half of them, through another exchange BTCe, which was also taken down by the FBI...
It's still ongoing and it's being taken very seriously. Like you said, a lot of people got seriously burned, so there is progress. The owner of MtGox is likely going to jail, and the insider who was slowly stealing everything is likely going to be uncovered. They've already broken down the blockchain and paths of most of the coins.
But unfortunately, the coins will probably never be uncovered. They were all likely cashed out over time through laundering :(
But it would be nice if one day they do recover a healthy remaining stash and I wake up to a pleasant payday

They had someone steal all their coins.  I had 100 coins in them when they were hacked :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:41:43
You can always sell them!

All the wallets were available as part of the bitcoin protocol. It's built in. Trading happened almost immediately when a Magic The Gathering Exchange site made a simple trading platform for them. You basically transferred cash to a Japanese based company and could start buying them there. 
The only real use at the time was novelty of doing direct transactions. Like the first purchase some guy bought a pizza for someone for like 10k bitcoins. Then it started really picking up when The Silk Road came online and now the coins could be used to discreetly purchase drugs online.

No because it was a steal to sell at 10 bucks then 70 bucks the last chunk went. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:19:35
Yeah, that was pretty much me. I just traded with it, then would cash out... Then trade, repeat. I'm just glad the people behind the theft are finally going to pay their dues.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:07:56
Realistically I probably would have cashed out at 100k. The people who make a killing off coins are those who already were really comfortable financially who could watch it ride for fun. 
But such is life. Which is not why I dwell on giving away a few thousand in the early days �� 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:40:49
Lol I was into Bitcoin so early, that when I sold most at $2.40 I thought I was making a ridiculous profit on some coins that likely have no use outside of The Silk Road. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:12:43
Yeah at 2k I thought that’s the new bubble. Lol. I still think it is at 10k. BTC still doesn’t have enough real world utility. It’s a great concept and I am a huge supporter. But it’s just being inflated and not used. It makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:24:29
Yeah, that's a pain in the ass... And by no means convenient. I don't want to have to drive around town and meet someone up just for bitcoins. Believe it or not, people prefer ease. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:27:56
Why? LBC has a premium in general. And Coinbase only charges like 1%
Shitty company because they banned me after years of being a customer after tracking my Bitcoins (which is so uncool), but still a reliable service.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:46:00
Right? They think that their subreddit post is somehow going to influence the market. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:15:00
Hell I remember in 2012 I was buying tons at 3 dollars a piece and spending them left in right in Berlin... I seriously spent hundreds of Bitcoin. 
I gave my buddy like 10 of them to encourage him to use them, but he never did. Needless to say he's very happy right now.
