Anything looks like anything if you pick the right scales.

Well what I meant is that the scale for each graph was different. So makes the comparison kinda pointless.

They did. See screenshot in the blogpost, you can either stop-buy or stop-sell.

I don't think they understand how cold storage is supposed to work. A backdoor should not make any difference to an offline wallet.

Coinbase can't allow you to resell your bitcoin, this is specifically forbidden by US laws. They usually detect this stuff either because you are trading large quantities, or there is an obvious link between your Coinbase account and another service like Localbitcoins.
Since you don't have a MSB license, depending on your volume, your best bet is probably to come clean and state that you have sent bitcoin to friends in the past, but you will not be doing this in future as you were not aware of MSB regulations. They don't like closing down accounts they don't have to, so if you have only been trading a reasonable amount then this will probably be fine.
If you have been reselling a lot (say, &gt; $1000/month) or there is a clear tie between your Coinbase account and a Localbitcoins account, then your "selling to friends" story probably won't fly. Again, they probably already know what you are up to, so your best bet is probably to come clean and let them know that you won't be doing it in future.

I guarantee if you start regularly withdrawing &gt;$1000/month in cash via ATMs your bank will start asking questions, or more likely just send you an account closure notice because it's not worth their time. Your bank also already has your SSN and employment details on file, and can track most of your purchasing activities (including the destination of funds) by your use of debit/credit cards.
Coinbase is operating in a heavily regulated industry, and has to convince their banking partners that they are not enabling money laundering or drug purchases, when in reality they have very little information about what most of their customers are actually doing with their bitcoin. Realistically they could not improve the process much without risking losing their banking partners.
