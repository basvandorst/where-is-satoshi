Right, but I just mean in the short run. The idea is to keep growth below the rate of Moore's Law, so that small individual users will never have to sacrifice security by handing over the responsibility of node validation to corporate institutions like banks.

Have you heard of CryptoKitties? People were canceling their ICO's of ERC20 tokens because of the high fees with ETH. 
Every single crypto will eventually have the same problems that Bitcoin is experiencing now (blockchain based ones, anyway). Raising the block size limit is certainly A solution, but not necessarily THE solution.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:03:01
True, but didn't that one guy lose $10,000 worth of bitcoin or something and he called it a "sacrifice for the greater good of the network"? Forget his name, but they talked about him in *Digital Gold*.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:29:56
The thing about lightning network centralization is the fact that, if you don't like the level of centralization you're seeing in lightning networks, you can either A. Start your own LN, or B. Don't use it. 
Either way, centralization of LNs has little if any affect on the base chain itself, which is the heart of security for all BTC users. Centralization of mining and/or validating nodes fucks with the entire system. 
Plus a lot of the stuff I've seen about Lightning Networks being at risk of centralization or the new way to do fractional reserve banking are just FUD spread by people who don't understand how it will really work in the first place.

I think they're just as afraid of bitcoin as we are of them. While I think they can definitely fuck things up in the short term, it really feels like they are just fighting the inevitable. Like Blockbuster telling everyone that Netflix is just a fad.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:43:57
US dollars?
Lol but seriously though, people value something as a store of value if they can be relatively sure that what they put in will at least remain the same if not grow over time when they need to access that value again.
If the BTC price goes down over time, then less and less people will recognize it as a "store of value".

Follow the directions on Ledgers website. You have to "split" the coins yourself into different wallets. They actually make it fairly easy to do.

I actually believe this market will be captured mainly by Monero, once everyone realizes that Bitcoin isn't nearly as "anonymous" as we originally thought.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:27:54
Depending on where you were storing your BTC at the time, then yes, you can still recover all the BCH you received at the fork. Even if you moved your BTC after the fork, the blockchain remembers exactly how much BCH you received.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:46
That's the one thing that bothers me the most. I'm all for the belief that the two coins can both coexist and be successful for different use cases, but it's called r/btc for shits sake. Start r/bch all you want, but don't sell people on a different fucking coin than the one it's for. I don't care if you do think it's the "real bitcoin", it's BCH, not BTC. How that's not straight up fraud I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:50:22
Why not both? Not a bad idea to set up accounts with multiple exchanges, even if you only plan on really using one of them.

Seems very suspicious to me that all the people that are super supportive of this gilded comment all have this same trend. Meanwhile, you have to go all the way down clicking "load more comments" a bunch of times, then unhide the posts that are at -33 just to see any kind of rebuttal?

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:24:22
It's backed by a promise of a secure and decentralized system to store your wealth in. It's arguably backed by more than the US dollar, because the only thing backing dollars is *confidence* in the US having the strongest buying power long term as the universal petro dollar. 
I value a system that's not controlled by a small group of white guys that control every aspect of the currency behind closed doors, including the supply.
Bitcoin is the money plus internet. The fact that you're listening to people who have an extremely vested interest in bitcoin failing means you probably aren't grasping the significance of this. "Money" is only valued by having something that other people want. We now have a free market economy that transcends countries and government systems full of red tape.

Bisque, and other similar P2P exchanges will most likely be the answer to that scenario. Sure the US government could shut down Coinbase or Bittrex, but in order to shut down direct P2P exchanges, they'd have to shut down the internet (right? At least that's how I understand it)

Oh I hear you, and I'm not necessarily able to quantify my suspicions, I just don't trust that guy one bit. And I know he can't fuck with the main chain network itself, but the LN is definitely susceptible to fuckery that can be hidden from the public. 
Basically what I am saying is, if Jack Dorsey is heavily involved in LN development, then I am much less likely to have much faith in it and will be far less likely to adopt it.

Just wanted to say, Roger Ver might put on the shittiest presentation that I've ever seen. Saw his presentation at Anarchopulco this year, and it literally felt like I was watching a high school student that was never taught any of the "things to never do in a presentation".
Every slide was either a chart with a title or a word wall, and he literally just read every word on each screen. Then when he finished reading the slide, he would just look up and essentially reword what he just read using virtually the same words in a slightly different order.
He also started legit crying when he brought up all the wars going on around the world.
I went down there as a Core supporter, looking to see if they could change my view with their arguments. And honestly, after listening to everyone earnestly, I left thinking BCH and bitcoin.com are even more full of shit than I thought before.

That sounds like a win-win if that's the only money you put into crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:58:17
Aaaaaand your plate is relevant again!
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:17:54


More like think about what would happen if they "predicted" the price going to $0 after they gained enough "credibility"... Their level of potential influence is terrifying.

Who's saying China is panic selling?
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:24:06
Well I don't know about faster connection (due to latency, especially compared to FIOS), but definitely good enough to broadcast a bitcoin transaction anywhere in the world. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:58:34
Feels like we’re approaching 1998ish in terms of internet timeline.
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:26:43
Whoa that's an interesting concept.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:10:11
I like you.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:55:26
Hey, double the bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:03:03
Same in Mexico
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:16:31
And unnecessary in a system where supply is automatically controlled and deflationary.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:45:57
Divide and concur is TPTB's only play. We need to come together now, and confront our differences later after this is all "too big to fail".
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:41:28
Interesting. So there goes the Goldman Sachs prediction theory I guess?
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:17:42
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:40:50
Nope. You're just as unsure as the rest of us, considering the IRS hasn't even figured something out yet.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:47:01
Your opinion is wrong. my opinion ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:59:44
I like Gemini for placing BTC and ETH buy/sell orders.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:33:12
Communication is key. Most people are all in agreement about most issues, but the ones at the hard ends of the spectrum are always the most vocal.
I've watched the transformation of r/bitcoin and r/btc the last year in the same way I've seen it happen over at r/conspiracy. The same shilling tactics and styles can be seen throughout the crypto subs. They're trying to pit one main sub against the other in order to continue driving the single most important wedge further into bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:16:51
Global internet connection is a major step for bitcoin growth. Should have put something like that in the title.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:59:44
I like Gemini for placing BTC and ETH buy/sell orders.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:37:23
All I see is a ton of people pulling out of the NYA. The only people I've seen that are excited about it are corporations and greedy miners (and that's outside of the echochamber).
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:23:10
Seriously, all this FUD is just going to make things worse. If anything, I'm impressed with how the market is handling this kind of volume right now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:32:13
The same way the third world now has iPhones.
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:12:11


Do you want government control and intervention? Because that's how you get government control and intervention.
@_date: 2018-07-28 01:51:48
I laughed way too hard at this. Then I couldn’t even explain why I was laughing to the people I’m with.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:35:08
But it also wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as the Mt. Gox debacle, because that was pretty much THE exchange at the time. Since then, we've seen dozens of (so much as we know) solid exchange platforms. If Mt. Gox happened today, the price wouldn't even get close to the percentage drop experienced last time. The environment is so different now, that anyone expecting a BIG crash is really just guessing based on past events. But with a bigger user based, lower inflation rate (to a sustainable level), and more practical applications being developed by the day, bitcoin will continue to become less and less affected by bad press and speculation.
The ship is getting bigger. The bigger the ship, the less you feel the waves.

What's holding? I only know how to hodl
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:18:50
Sooo is it safe to assume that whomever came up with name the name is likely to be old enough to still remember the days of cassettes?
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:03:47
That's like calling silver, copper, bronze and steel shitmetals because they aren't gold...
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:37:34
Could be $50k, could be $500k, could be $5... there's really no theoretical limit yet as we have never seen a currency like it in the history of commerce. If it goes on long enough, the deflationary aspect of BTC only adds to the potential upper limit.
Just pray TPTB don't manage to succeed at fucking it up for everyone...
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:31:40
If I've be hodling since I bought in, does that still count as capital gains? My crypto portfolio has certainly increased in value, but isn't it technically all theoretical until I sell my coins for USD?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:52:09
I stop loss by buying the dip. Don't need my HW wallet to buy more!
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:35:38
Hodl hodl hodl.
Then buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:03:59
Yes, this is the establishment's propaganda from the first Google result. Thank you for sharing.
Read the book and you'll see exactly why TPTB would want to discredit him.
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:38:59
Lol ok dude, whatever you say.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:35:57
Ahhhh I see my mistake, thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:12:14
*Supply* cannot be manipulated, I think is what he was going for. Price certainly can... for now anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:51:03
Might want to check out r/BitcoinBeginners, great resource.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:04:40
Shut up Dad
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:09:12
My only hope is that it's run on some kind of closed loop system, (potentially blockchain based?) that can't be manipulated or fucked with. Because I agree, that much control over the internet by one group really scares me too. It's why I'm already super skeptical of Google Fiber popping up all over the place.
I doubt it will happen like that, but I could also still see Musk doing something like that too. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:43:38
Nor is it really decentralized.
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:17:10
How much gold is currently in circulation? Who’s in control of the gold?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:35:48
If we're looking at it long term, then Bitcoin is always down...
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:30:23
Lol what is "This is gentleman"? I kinda have an idea just based on context, but I don't think I've seen that one specifically before.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:33:40
I like this answer. I sold any ETH I bought over 200, saved everything else all the way down to $3.50
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:03:23
What a terrifying but totally plausible thought.

Elon is about to change the game. His wifi satellites will bring billions of people online. Particularly in areas that need something like Bitcoin the most.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:02:18
I love proposing this idea to people framed this way. In 30 years, I hope we're looking back at how FUCKING RIDICULOUS the whole system is, and wondering how anyone would buy into such a scam.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:18:27
THIS. Fucking, this.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:00:30
Check out the book *The Creature from Jekyl Island* by G. Edward Griffin... it'll forever change how you see the world of banking and government. Absolutely fascinating book. I truly believe it should be required reading in schools.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:46:55
Could not be a more ill-timed post, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:24:10


Dollar is just as volatile in the long term IMO. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:35:49
Who's to say that the GDP growth and 100 years of incredible prosperity and technological growth wouldn't have occurred under a decentralized system like cryptos? Economic growth doesn't need shady banking practices to be achieved. Granted, it may have been necessary in the past, but everything after the removal of the gold standard is just a complete and utter scam IMO.
(I may be completely wrong here, but I don't believe I am. If you have issues with my statements, I'd love to hear them!)
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:08:53
Also, you're going to want to buy some hardware for cold storage. Don't want to trust the exchanges with holding all your coins. I mean, FDIC insured only means something until it doesn't...

...because it’s not safe from manipulation. Still has nothing to do with price manipulation. 
But then again, I’m not them, so I have no idea what they really meant.
