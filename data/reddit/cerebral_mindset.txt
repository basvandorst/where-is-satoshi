I don't need to click or google since I have 4 credit cards and have held at least one for 15 years.  But I'm sure you know much more about this stuff than I do :)

Don't waste your time with this "enlightened" one.

It's "you're", and you're absolutely incorrect.  Higher up you said you don't have a credit card because you "don't like it".  Then how can you give your insight on something you don't know anything about?  If you have $500 on your credit card, spend it, then ask for a refund, it won't take 24-48 hours to have that credit back.

This post seriously belongs on Leaving the grocery store with paper money, credit cards, passport, metal coins, and purchase receipt in hand?  How the hell does that make sense.  If your CC is out, why do you also have 2 additional forms of payment in hand?  That's only one of the absurd statements here...

Don't worry friend.  I don't like anyone who uses the word 'why' after 'hence'.  It's incorrect linguistically.  Hence is basically acting as the why.  Plus he provided a lot of words with zero actual sources, I just view this sub for laughs honestly.

What is a pityfull?

He only asked if you'd buy it and report back.  You replied with a lot of words that are not a direct response.  That's all I meant.

If you need to put steak sauce on a steak, there is a problem with your steak.
