HOW AM I MAKING CLAIMS YOU FUCKING TARD? It took almsot 5 hours for confirmation due to the FOMO going on today. If BITCOIN want to be taken seriously it cant take 4+ hours for confirmation!
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:29:04
LOL yes it does buddy
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:10:56
How am I an idiot? Please explain? It seems like your the one who's a fucking retard. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:32:27
0.0005 BTC doesnt count as a big player.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:35:03
And it has....
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:36:11
Nope, already down and itll keep going down
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:10:52
Durrrrr I'm cryptohoney durrr I'm a retard. Sell your house for bitcoins if you think it's so great you fucking tard.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:55:31
Of course they do more you donkey but why use bitcoin when I can use debit? Yeah that's what I thought.

Hey thanks a ton, this worked. I was trying to get all my coins off any exchanges or online wallets and this is the only one that gave me some troubles. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:45:29
It does not take days for a debit transaction to be approved and completed. It is practically instant.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:53:44
It's a quite simple concept that you seem to be too stupid to understand. Bitcoin will never become anything with it taking hours to process. Every other coin is practically instant and some have zero fees. Bitcoins days are numbered. The only thing it has is that it was the first. But you're a bit challenged so I don't know if you understand cryptocurrency very well.

it will drop lower than the 1800 that it went close too within the next month or two. Remind yourself and I wont say I told you so.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:58:04
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:56:37
No shit, your selling a house. You think that your gonna be able to sell a house with bitcoins and no have the government do something about it? Haha your delusional.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:36:57
Thanks buddy, maybe you should learn how markets work too...
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:23:12
Oh I've sold already, then I'm gonna buy on the huge dip in the next month or two. Then when all the FUD around the HF happens and it turns out there's no problems then it'll skyrocket and ill make cash money.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:57:41
Yeah I'm saying all of bitcoin, 99% of transactions don't even get confirmed within 2-4 hours.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:26:03
Here's an idea, shut the fuck up when you think you know something that you don't.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:48:21
Righhht since its high of 2911 on Polo its now down to 2670..... yeahhhh so not reallllly
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:32:04
