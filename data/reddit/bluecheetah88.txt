give them a few days. i dont think they are that big of a company.  so far out of multiple email conversations with them. only 1 person has ever talked to me.  give em a bit of time. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:29:38
i aint lettin my cat anywhere near my miners :(   yes they are warm but i paid waaay too much for them while im still waiting for the ROI
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:24:01
segwit is a requirement for lightning. so they are boned either way due to their stubbornness.

if you want to light your cash on fire. then yes.   build your own system.  a 12 gpu system can be made for around 3.5-5k    this is just a rip off

i went from 1 to 3 then cut out ethereum when vitalik started pumping bcash on twitter.   and there i sit :)

2 months late to the post? :P      all things decentral is fine. their stuff just takes a while to ship sometimes.  and they only have 1 person working customer support so give them a break.   i have ordered quite a few things from them.  the most issues i have had was when the people delivering my mail actually stole a lighter with my bitcoin receive address on it.

ya know the same goal can be accomplished with a compromised computer and a key logger right?  get access to the pc from key logger credentials. the logger also can get password or anything else from whatever wallet they are using.

can we report it as fraud then?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:12
i don't think its the fault of coinbase. i think bcash shills were waiting and pumped it whenever it went live and coinbase halted trades.   the bcash trading went live Right after bitcoin dipped to 14k and recovered to 17k.   could be massive market manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:39:32
why not?  it takes away the only advantage bcash has
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:02:04
nope. gotta wait for bitmain to restock.  and have btc ready to buy em.   also. i would suggest saving up. because there is the japanese GMO group about to release their own miner soon.  rumored to have 26-40TH/s 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:43:15
Using coinbase as a wallet. Lul not your keys, not your bitcoin. No better on coinbase than in a bank. Its why i have a hardware wallet.

LN is about to launch. Id give it a month or so 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:39:28
yep.  I'm saving up with my current miner to bail ship from bit main.  i don't care if its 1400w per 10Th/s as long as the hash rate is good, ill be one of the first to run screaming away from bit main.  dear god we need competition. and if what GMO has is real. and comes to market.  dear god bit main is in trouble.

LTC didn't du nuttin. lol. the king needs his servants :P   in all seriousness LTC has also been here from the beginning. and i would love to see it unseat both ethereum and bcash
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:59:16
its been in development for a few years. i believe everything will be fine when the launch happens.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:43:22
umm no. its launching first quarter 2018
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:55:19

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:12:53
no.  fuck ethereum too. 
vitalik has made it very clear he is friendly to bcash. 
BTC AND LTC FOREVER.

naa. if your bitcoin is loosing on ya. it means you need to buy more ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:17
i should have said personal guess.  i keep reading everywhere that LN is getting ready for deployment. the code base is ready and working right now. so i would say just a few months at most before its out. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:59:09
Friendly reminder.  we need people to use Decentralized exchanges such as bisq. decentralize everything and the banks can't touch it that easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:03:09
its fully functional on test net right now. all tests have passed and version 1.0 is out. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:12
first off. buy from bitmain because its stupid buying from anywhere else with that 100% or more markup on the price. 2nd. where im at, i get 0.1$ kWh for power in the US. 
heres a breakdown. pretty close to what im getting.

step 1. get lots of miners.  step 2, make a lot of btc. step 3. invest it all in more miners and have enough stored in btc for a house and renouncing citizenship.   step 4. move to germany or some place that is bitcoin friendly and setup the mine.  step 5. live out your life happy you don't have to deal with this BS in the US ever again. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:28
why don't we go to bisq. get a decentralized exchange rolling?

bitcoin ATH's are not the goal. but they sure are nice ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:13
well bcash can only handle a max of around 24 txn per second. bitcoin somewhere between 7 - 14. lightning is capable of *billions* per second. but real world applicability and adoption will determine the total transaction per second it can do.   and yes. LTC &gt; BCH

But bitcoin keeps crashing up. Its a bubble /s. 
In all realness yeah price is not predictable but the current trend is the moon. I just made 100$ in the past week with bitcoin and im dumping more cash into my coin pile... Well. Until i can get a miner :p
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:52:25

I ran the numbers for my town in Mississippi. A S9 makes 400-550$ a month after paying power. I don't really know what everyone is talking about being profitable. Unless im mining something big here. Then im just blind

wait.  so you mean that bitmain is actually getting some damn competition? :D     i got nearly 2k(USD) in btc im holding for a miner right now and i was about to get a S9.   what do D:
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:11:43
bitcoin keeps crashing but every time it crashes up.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:04:07
the time on return for the miners are about 3-5 months.   they cost around 1500$ usd and generate 400-600$ a month.  and thats not even touching the value of bitcoin going up. witch offsets the difficulty of it. because i know a month ago bitcoin was making 450$ with a s9 but now its nearly 600 due to it going over 8k
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:23
quickly transacted low fee crypto.  we got ethereum and litecoin for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:33:35
Bitcoin illegal. Yes.  Can they enforce it? Good fkin luck m8. (near impossible unless they go full N korea / china)

aaaand it droppped
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:43:39
where im at i got cheap enough power. 0.08-0.09c/kwh  a antminer can still get 350-450$ a month(after accounting for power).  i think it is a good investment if it can pay itself off in 3-4 months.   &gt;also if i do scale up with it into warehouse level. at least i can pull some of the hash power away from china :)     also. i wont signal segwit2x or anything. i will generally go with the consensus of the community when mining too.

@_date: 2018-03-01 00:45:52
again. read up on what the bitcoin protocol is suppose to do. and for that matter do the same for lightning.  lightning has no immutability without bitcoin. it has nothing without settling on the bitcoin block chain.  it can not function without the block chain under it because it is a 2nd layer protocol not a base protocol.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:49:26
Right.  When they do it its fine but lets make sure that it’s illegal for everyone else and just assume large fluctuations are laundering.   -every modern bank

Without miners there will be no blocks.  If the difficulty goes too high, mining will become even more centralized than it already is.  
Tl;DR: without miners your node is useles ;)

again. you dont understand how the thing works.  IF THERE ARE NO MINERS. THERE ARE NO NEW BLOCKS.   if there are no blocks on the main chain. lightning is useless.

@_date: 2017-09-25 00:54:47
i dont think you know the function of miners..  miners keep the network secure. they do the hash functions. they make the block chain move.. without them. bitcoin is dead.  yeah coins will get all mined up. but miners still get paid through transaction fees too. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:56:05
Im working to get a few S9's right now. Going to attempt to build a farm site in the US eventually. Get some of the hash power back from China. Buuut my first miner purchase is a month or two away. . Im building it from nothing so it will be a while.

Profits are not marginal if 1. Your power is cheap enough. 10c usd / kwh or less.   2 you have enough miners.  2-4 and scaling up happens pretty quick. -when bitcoin isn’t crashing-  my s9 is a little above breaking even. Profits return when price goes up.  I mean just before the crash these miners were making 1k usd per month.  I just see it as a investment to grow in a strange way.
