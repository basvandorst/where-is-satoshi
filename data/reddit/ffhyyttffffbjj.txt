Doesn't matter. Hard fork has no continuity. Don't underestimate the inertia of the existing system.

Maybe anxpro.com

You mean it allows segwit signaling blocks that don't contain any segwit txs? Seems like unnecessary pedantry as the nodes will still need to understand segwit to properly filter out segwit txs from their blocks.. No existing non segwit nodes will be able to do that so there isn't really any choice to include non segwit blocks.

Hmm so after segwit is activated it will allow non segwit signaling blocks.. That seems much worse than just banning them forever.. It won't really be viable for miners to continue mining them with old software because as I said before they will need to understand segwit in order to not accidentally include an invalid transaction and risk being orphaned by a segwit miner. The only way non segwit blocks can still be mined is if the activation is a complete failure and segwit mining fails to gain almost any hash power to enforce segwit rules. This would be a disaster for segwit users since their funds can be stolen.

Absolutely serious

I don't think that is accurate. Fidor does set the name field to your name, but doesn't populate the account number field, or at least they don't put an Iban there. It works great with kraken and bitstamp, I am not sure about btc-e, but I think I have used it with okpay which allows further transfers to btc-e. Fidor doesn't work with coinbase because they require you to verify micro payments sent to your account. Since there is no iban there is no way to proceed. Maybe some other exchanges also have this issue.

Transaction fees are based on the size in bytes of the transaction, not the monetary value. In a simple 1 input 1 output tx it probably won't be more than $1

At least there will be somewhere to dump the HF altcoin

Try  its similar to revolut but you get your own Iban. Fidorbank.UK is also good for this, they send transfers in your own name, but don't yet have ibans. Fidor does work well with kraken, but I can't say if it works with btc-e or not. Another option might be bunq.com, a dutch online bank.

The block size isn't that important. Fixing transaction malleability is.

Sounds rather contentious.

I don't think there are any legal obligations on the users to not use unregistered exchanges.

Their bitcoin trading is on a separate site coin.z.com that their customers will have to sign up separately for.. It isn't just another currency pair on their existing fx platform.

Do they support slaac ipv6 assigned addresses? Maybe they will some day.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:16:43
Try kraken. They don't do cc, but the limits should be fine. Also might as well try Gemini too

Most iot crap is totally centralized anyway connecting home to some cloud api.. Might as well use PayPal.
