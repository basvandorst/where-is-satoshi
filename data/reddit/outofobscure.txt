While i agree with you that it's probably not for everyone over a certain age, that problem will solve itself over time...

i have a feeling you are not going to like this:  ;)

it's much easier to own bitcoin than have a bank account and debit/credit cards, that's the whole point. all you need is a 20$ smartphone and someone to send you some (for example as payment for goods/services). people can do this even in locations where there are no banks.

patience young padawan, yes it's probably not a good idea to take absolute figures like "100%" or "2025" very serious, but the effect could just as well be nearly the same with massive adoption and it entering into many people's lives just like the internet and/or mobile phones did. And no, it's not certain that this is what will happen, or when exactly, and where it will happen first, you have to allow for some wiggle room, nevertheless i'm willing to take a bet on it having a big impact. Also, when calling someone out for posting "terrible graphs" i'd expect you to provide better ones. I simply pointed out that your comparision to credit cards isn't the best one either, as one of the advantages of bitcoin is that you do not need anyone's approval or presence to open an account / make a wallet and start transacting, so in a way there's less friction. Does your grandma use credit cards by the way?

shameless self promotion: i also made some bitcoin art if you want to check it out :)

thx for checking it out! yeah curious to see what happens myself too! by the way, there is only one painting, no editions, no prints etc, max supply of 1 :) Another interesting aspect i think is the intrinsic versus the perceived value (intrinsic would be the btc stored on it, and perceived value what someone would buy the painting for).

no, you are simply confusing the internet with the web. the internet existed decades before the web. there was actually another killer application on the internet before the web, which was email. not going to argue with you anymore, if you're so bearish, just sell ?

well let's just say we fundamentally disagree: "The Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) was developed by Robert E. Kahn and Vint Cerf in the 1970s"  What you are talking about is the web, which came into existence in the 90ies and brought with it mass adoption. It's a layer on top of a protocol, similar to how there will be application layers on top of bitcoin and ethereum.
The internet was about information, bitcoin is about money, i'd say money is probably an equally big game changer, if not bigger, because it touches everything. And you are missing quite a bit in that list of benefits, for example that its's permission-less and defaltionary, but i'm too tired to list everything. It's definitely not "just money", it's programmable money, and the implications of that are huge.

and? it doesn't automatically follow that we get rid of cash and fiat currencies. also they can have someone do it on their behalf, they will probably not even know about it when their pension funds start buying in...

The fee to buy Bitcoin is quite high at these ticket machines tough, 6-8% iirc. There is also a limit of 500 CHF (per day iirc).
