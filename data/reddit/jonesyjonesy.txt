I'm not sure shorting will be as profitable the closer Ghash, or any pool continuously gets to 51%. Who is going to be willing to make large shorting payouts if Bitcoin security is constantly at risk (and thus dropping in price)? The odds would be like betting on Rafael Nadal vs. some no name tennis player.

My only gripe is the concern about what will happen when Bitcoin maxes out its finite supply. He makes it sound as though Bitcoin is being kept alive by its inflation. When really it's not and the spending behavior will be no different when they're maxed at 21 million.

Why do people keep saying this? I see it on Twitter too. As though suicides dictate whether or not a bottom is in. Dumbest thing I've ever heard.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:18:23
"The bottom isn't in. No suicides yet" kind of implies it.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:38:36
No, the notion that a bottom has not been achieved until suicides are reported.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:42:19
I think you're confused what I'm saying. I'm not saying people won't commit suicide for losing a bunch of money. I'm saying it is completely stupid to use it as a technical indicator for "the bottom".
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:28:07
He may not have caused the crash but let's not pretend market selling that amount doesn't impact the markets. Saying it's "fucking nothing" seems to suggest it presented zero impact. Completely disagree, as a 5k btc market sell today could push the price downward 5-10%.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:19:44
You mean such things happen in the event of a significant loss, irrespective of whether or not it was "the bottom"
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:41:45
It's one of the dumbest takes in crypto.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:40:16
And the bottom wasn't in. Glad we cleared this up.
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:22:00
Is that not what we’re doing? The hilarious thing is that most of the settlement recipients didn’t even want a cash settlement (since they received only a fraction of the value of their Gox BTC), so it was an unnecessary sell off.

So how do you kill what doesn't exist? You just said "this kills Tezos...".
Presumably you meant when it does exist, in which case Tezos is a completely different platform than Simplicity.

Sure, but if this introduces bigger pockets we'd see larger buy and sell orders
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:52:36
Just out of curiosity how could Bitcoin see a boost and "big profits" while "reducing volatility"? I struggle to see how you can have both a price increase and a decrease in volatility, kind of a yin and yang type scenario.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:17:13
Sizable increases or decreases would *make* it more volatile.

Insurance could be relative to the value of bitcoin, instead of making the insured Bitcoins relative to its fiat value. This would eliminate the volatility risk.

The interesting part of all this is that, to the average person, Bitcoin is also extremely boring and difficult to explain. Just like the differences of altcoins to bitcoins. Altcoins pose boring but actual advantages to Bitcoin. Zerocoin for instance offers more anonymity between transfers and is looking to be adopted into existing altcoin blockchains ( This anonymity would be nice for situations like, say, a Wikileaks donation. Then there's a coin like Primecoin. It probably won't be around for long, but it gives the ability for companies/institutions/individuals interested in prime numbers to "buy" more computing power directed towards prime numbers by purchasing prime coins and therefore having the value of primecoins increase in order to incentive more mining. 
Sure the advantages might make you yawn but they're advantages nonetheless. Altcoins are going to stick around. Do we know which one's? Hell no. But Altcoins will fill the holes that BTC can't, which is a good thing. Anything keeping crypto currency strong poses a benefit to everyone.

Not highly unlikely for a bitcoin insurance company to have a vault of bitcoins. The only prerequisite to this obviously is the company would need an astronomical amount of bitcoin at its inception, just like every insurance company has a fabulous amount of stake in existing financial markets.

He's basically selling LTC to dollars and waiting for BTC price to drop.
Once BTC price drops to a nice low price, he buys BTC with those dollars. Once BTC price rises again, he buys back LTC. This gives him more LTC than he originally had.

You're probably right but it's always good to keep in mind crypto currency isn't a conventional economic model. It's difficult to apply conventional economic theory to BTC as you would a stock. How often do you see 6,000% growth in a penny stock?
