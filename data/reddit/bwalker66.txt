But the alternative may be the person just buying the phone from Apple and giving them hundreds of dollars.,

Not really. What a couple of them can easily do is just replace the screen for £150 and then they'll have an iPhone 5 and a Nexus 5. A couple of the people looked like they more than destroyed the screen though.

So you would recommend me to but from BitStamp and then send that to my Circle wallet instead of just buying straight from Circle?
UK also.

I'd announce it to my immediate family, not the world. And yeah I would take on a mortgage, with $50k down + whatever I have now the monthly payments on the rest would be pretty decent. I wouldn't take one that I couldn't already afford the monthly payments to of course. Plus I'd rather not have all that money on hand just sitting there, and if I have no huge savings then no one can really leech off of me. Whats the problem with that plan?

That's life changing to some and this guy isn't even acting like it's a big deal, he must have a nice job or something :. It would be so much to me that I'd take my immediate family out for a meal and would have to make it a big announcement. Then I'd give them $5k each and with the last $50k+ I'd put a deposit down on owning a house.
I'm just over here with 0.05 btc..

I have student debt(nothing crazy like you), but the interest rate is sooo low that I'd probably prefer to pay the tiny payments each month for the next 20 years.

Yeah but it'll probably slow down or experience a big drop again like last time since there will be a lottt of people trying to buy them now due to their fast increasing price, then it'll slow down, then nobody will buy them, then boom, a big drop. But then it will raise up again manyt times higher than it fell just like last time.
Im hoping thats whats going to happen though, because i want to buy some after they go down. Probably won't happen though, im no expert.

Yeah it's not like anyone could have known that it would go up this high. You're not dumb for not investing sooner, you just wasn't risky enough.
