I'm pro-trump and a bitcoin maximilist. After thinking about it, trump is part of the old gang, you aren't going to teach him any new tricks at this point. I will continue to buy bitcoin but the lesson here is that it's perfectly OK to not follow 100% of a person's opinions that you like.

i actually have no idea, i purchased the pi 4 but have no idea how it works. I read somewhere it costs like £20 to keep it online the whole year

im interested to find out if i can do other things on the pi as i run the node.

No intention of making profit. In fact it will probably cost me money in electric.

i think I read somewhere that you can purchase something to plug it directly into your cpu and it remains on, even when your pc is off
