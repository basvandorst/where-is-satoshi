Bots. Lots and lots of bots with the same TA library.

Private Banks (enabled by the federal reserve) print money all day long. It's called the fractional reserve system.

No irony, democracy is a soft form of communism.

The flippening is still on.

It is something to celebrate if Mugabe is gone. Sorry, but chaos happens. It's not good, but sometimes it's the only way to effect positive change. You should read the fourth turning.

I haven't. Cryptonomicon touches on a few ideas, and is a recommended read.

Releasing episodically makes sense. I've considered it, and will continue to do so. Thanks for the recommendation!

Fair 'nuf. It is a preview, and I'm looking forward to getting some feedback. I think you'll find it's worth your time.

Upon checkout, you have the option to select crypto. I'm using coinpayments.net, so I accept a wide array of different cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2015-07-13 23:39:18
Thanks, I'll check it out!
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:40:36
How can you have positive change without a period of chaos?
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:24:06
Thanks for the comment. Great points on all.
The line definitely needs to be excised. As you pointed out, it's confusing.
The intent was to draw a contrast. The two men, allied to the cause, are intelligent in their own right. They are sub-specialized in the field of killing people, often with advanced technology. They don't have the knowledge that Cromwell (a Satoshi-esque Renaissance man) enjoys.
I absolutely agree that a paid third party editor will make for a better book. That's always been part of the plan and another reason for the crowdfunding approach.
Thank you for your helpful input.

Just a quick note, I chose not to use Bitcoin and Satoshi in the book because it's Satoshi's invention.
I fully expect he will re-emerge someday, and I don't want to do anything that might redefine or change his legacy.
In addition, the next generation of cryptocurrencies do offer some really interesting innovations that can be applied to governance.
So, tl;dr I'm not some sort of Bitcoin traitor :).

Thank you! I'll make those corrections. Much appreciated.

Yep. I've done a lot of brainstorming on this subject, and Crypto has great potential in this space; far beyond just verification of IP ownership. 
Crypto 2.0 will revolutionize intellectual property sales and return power to the creators.

Only if you consider a probable 6x gain a bad thing.

Bankers are tired of hearing about Bitcoin and they know it's an existential threat. They would rather collectively stick their heads in the sand. Simultaneously, they are afraid of being left out, but unwilling to challenge their worldview.
Fear, groupthink and loathing are what's in play, not reality. ��
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:06:51
This is so.
For now.

I agree, but price is the ultimate quantified measure of overall value, and that has yet to suffer.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:08:47
Spoiler alert: Both are correct.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:07:39
Every time you split you diminish Bitcoin, the brand. 
It becomes less and less likely that people accept "one coin" as the real deal. The bubble busts in the confusion and chaos.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:06:27
21 million bitcoin = limited quantity, scarcity.
After three splits, with an infinite more down the line, it's time for Bitcoin to stop with this scarcity nonsense.
Ideologically, I agree with network splits. But you can't claim scarcity for much longer. The market is going to figure this out really quick and the crash will begin.

I'm so old school, I came for anti central banking principles and waited for the gains.
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:54:53
You do realize that if fiat fails, true capitalism wins, right?
