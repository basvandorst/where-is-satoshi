if privacy is an individual choice, then there's no fungibility. That is the tradeoff. If this is left as opt-in, then people are free to associate the need of privacy to evil-doing activities.

And big brother will know who/what a key has voted. Complete transparency yes, zero-anonymity :( 
If said person voted against a totalitarian government, he'd be prosecuted for no apparent reason.

While I think this is a huge step forwards, I still don't see how this improves fungibility, since I can still coins going into a tumbler? Unless this was baked into the protocol completely and every transaction is forcibly sent to the tumbler, then every transaction is fully-provably anonymous, otherwise, if this is an "opt-in", it is still a problem.

it is sort of like using Tor yeah? There's a general consensus nowadays that if you're doing nothing wrong, what's the need of anonymity? Whilst I'd like to be optimistic like you, law enforcement agencies and governments don't seem to like people using anonymous services.

ISPs do know when you attempt to connect to a Tor entry node. Same thing with Tumblebit, exchange/whoever is interested would know I'm using a laundry service. Therefore, opt-in privacy is never really a good thing. It should be a compulsory feature.

What about moral hazard? If the community sets the precedent by allowing socialised losses. This incident will be used again and again for future hacks. This takes away responsibility from exchanges and transfers risk to the community instead.

The whole point of a decentralised cryptocurrency is so no one can introduce regulation at their own whims. The whole "association" is a proposal to form a cartel, it will simply increase barriers of entry for newcomers who want to start a forum for the exchange of cryptocurrencies.

This reads like the formation of a cartel.

After tumbling, it will be back in circulation, no?

Any deviation from mining on the canonical chain for whatever reason also diminishes the security of the entire bitcoin ecosystem.
Suppose if there was a race to mine a substantial fork to undo the theft for whatever reason and hashrate was split between the two forks, it gives room to an adversary who's hostile to bitcoin to mount an attack while hash rate is split. Following this logic, it is simply irresponsible for anyone to suggest that mining a substantial fork is worth considering.
