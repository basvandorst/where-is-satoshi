Yeah, and you get all the idiots with their "I'm sorry you don't understand basic supply+demand / economics" if you have any doubt about their "btc $1 million USD in 3 months" predictions.
That worries me about this space more than anything else. There's a lot of clueless people that are all-in right now.

Maybe, but if the price really did hit $500,000 per coin, there's still $78,125 / minute incentive to secure the network just off the block reward after 3 halvings.
Edit: compared to around $1,500 / minute incentive right now off the block reward

This article says "by 2030", and by then the block reward will have halved three more times, meaning your first calculation should be divided by 8.
I think the article is BS, fwiw.

Being in the "21" or "1 million" club means you have 1 millionth of the total final bitcoin supply, not that you are the 1 millionth largest hodler. They can't both be true unless there are exactly one million hodlers with exactly 21 bitcoin... and you'd also be tied for first
If you had one millionth of the total fiat narrow money supply, you'd have around 30 million USD. If you had a millionth of the total fiat broad money supply, you'd have around 80 million USD

Mining doesn't set the low point for the price of bitcoin.
Mining hash power will always chase the price of bitcoin - up or down. If the price cuts in half, it's no longer economical to mine bitcoin and people will therefore shut their miners off... until enough miners have shut off and hash power has decreased such that it becomes economical to mine again.

Do you think that one day the government will announce "by the way, the dollar will be losing most of its value over the next few years. Please take this time to prepare yourself at a leisurely pace".
Do you think that before the next stock market crash, Mr stock market representative will make an announcement that everyone should take some time out of their busy lives over the next few weeks to unwind their positions at their convenience to avoid any discomfort?
Do you think that a run on the bank is kind of like a 5k race event that is scheduled a year in advance?

Considering they still need to meet all of their obligations to banks/vendors in fiat, I think it's fair to describe 50% as hodling.

Uh, yeah I do

If you had the chance to crow about it on CNBC, you'd be right on that.

There isn't really anything in this article to support the claim in the title except "the index provider noted that technology and currencies were the only two strategies that performed well in both time periods" and "the Currency Index also had strong contributions from exposure to digital currencies".
The rest of the article is about hedge funds, why they suck, and why they stay generally away from bitcoin. Then the conclusion is that "more hedge fund managers *may* start following their peers and invest in the digital currency"... yeah ok great argument
Tl;dr Don't read it. Clickbait headline to get fanboys excited but no substance

The user Surging Chaos on there summed it up pretty well with his comment:






I think they are all just bitter that PM's aren't experiencing the same type of growth. I think it goes to show that it's really about greed and personal gain, not decentralization and taking power away from central banks.

The same strict capital controls that contribute to the popularity of bitcoin in China also make it difficult to close the loop on the arbitrage cycle.
You buy bitcoin on an American exchange with USD, send it to a Chinese exchange, and sell it for CNY. The hard part is then taking your CNY on the Chinese exchange and converting it back into USD in an American account.
