Liquidity gets my vote. Unless a business can run day-to-day expenses in BTC (salary, accounts payable, rent, taxes) they must convert to fiat at the end of the day.
My (limited) experience with Coinbase is that it takes a nonzero (and variable!) length of time to make the switch through an exchange. Plus there's a daily limit amounting to about $18k. That's *nothing* in a healthy business. Again, my experience is limited to Coinbase, but it doesn't sound like MtGOX is demonstrably superior.
There's a need for more exchanges and/or significant improvements to the existing exchanges to improve liquidity.

Right now the expense of adding bitcoin as a payment system gets filed under "marketing budget to reach hipsters". 
* It's not making them much (if any) money. Sure they're not paying 3% credit card fees, but the exchanges are taking a non-zero amount and it's a wash.
* It took money to implement the system, if only employee time.
* Then they had to advertise their new payment system! Press releases don't write themselves, ya know.
To have serious businesses adopt BTC as currency you have to show why they're losing business (or leaving money on the table) by *not* accepting it. Right now it's like trying to sell websites in the mid '90s. Yeah, there's this internet thing that geeks think is neat, but having a website costs money and isn't bringing in enough customers to make up for it.
If were to go on a mega shopping spree under the condition that the store accepts bitcoin, then yeah, you'll drive some adoption. But by and large most of a business's customers will pay in fiat just as readily (if not more so) than BTC.
So for now it remains an expense with minimal up-side, unless you put a premium on the geeky street cred.
