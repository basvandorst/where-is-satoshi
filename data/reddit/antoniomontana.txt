Electrum seems so difficult. I'm a total newb and still figuring out BTC. I think I have a grasp on it. but someone was so kind as to give me a 0.1 BTC tip to get me started. I sent it to my bitme, then to one of the receive addresses in my electrum but it never showed up. So my .099 (what i had after fee) totally disappeared to some address somewhere. So much for my first try lol. Turns out I've never been connected to a server. I had only downloaded Electrum, but it seems I have to download the following chain of stuff:  
  
SIP --&gt; PyQT4 --&gt; Electrum --&gt; execute "python electrum"  
  
and for someone who isn't tech savvy, it's just too much. I uninstalled about 30 seconds ago after a day or two of frustration and just went with instawallet. From now on it'll just be bitme --&gt; instawallet --&gt; SR. Electrum seems wonderful for experienced users, but not for us beginners :/

Thanks for being patient with me. Yeah alright. I haven't made a single transaction yet so it isn't too late. I also use bitme for anonymity. But then once my coins are on bitme, (correct me if I'm wrong) I would export them to a wallet, then to SR/online businesses and such?

What are the bots commands though? I'm sorry I'm not very tech savvy and if I'm causing you frustration I apologize. The address the bot gave me is clickable, but how do I give the bot my address to tell him where to put the tip? Also, in my confusion I've downloaded armory and the actual bitcoin program and I'm just super confused with both. Why can't this be super simple.

exactly. I don't want that.
@_date: 2013-01-12 16:29:41
This is why I didn't want to use them. They require wayyy too much of my information
