The crypto market is based around Bitcoin but ETH and LTC usually are available as trading options on crypto exchanges. The key is to buy ETH or LTC cheap, wait for it to rise and for your desired crypto to drop and then trade high in ETH while the coin your buying is low.

When a divergence starts happing the people who bough coins in the cents right now may be worth hundreds if not thousand of dollars in the coming future. It's interesting to see how all the other markets and technology moves with Bitcoin. Like DASH, when Bitcoin dropped DASH increased by almost 30% within the same hour. I think the key to future success in this market is diversifying what crypto you buy.

If you didn't know when trading using a bank transfer the trade occurs at the market price when it first was initiated, so not the market price 3-5 days later when it goes though and is more preferably as it only has a 0.2-0.5% fee. You can also find a BTC ATM near you (easy and instant but a 8% exchange rate), if your in Canada you can do interact e-transfer (30 mins and 0.2% fee), and if you want you can do credit card (insant and a 3% fee).

Bought some LTC and ETH on the dip so hopefully it was a good buy. Bit coin scares me right now with this crazy boom.

ETH was getting traded off like crazy and the price dropped when BTC started to drop. ETH follows the BTC market trends rather closely but is more stable in the long run so when it's low (usually caused buy Bitcoin dropping) it will slowly clime back up even if Bitcoin doesn't.
