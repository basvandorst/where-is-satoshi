Never buy tacos at a Bitcoin joint. It's not safe.

Scroll down a bit (if your browser page size requires) to the American Heritage Dictionary's usage note on "he".

In the original comment: "if, say, an item they ordered never arrived."
In this comment: "100% guarantee against fraud."
With respect to credit cards, I believe these are two quite different things. The guarantee that cards offer is against fraudulent charges on the card account not related to any action of the cardholder. I don't think cards *guarantee* chargebacks (transaction reversibility) on cardholder request against merchants with whom the cardholder voluntarily made a transaction. They *may*, of course, provide a reversal in some cases depending on circumstances.

"Often"? Would you accept "sometimes"? :)

The [list of wallets]( has an "anonymity" rating for each wallet. To take two popular -- or at least well-known --  wallets for example, Bitcoin Core has an anonymity rating of "high" while Electrum has a rating of "medium." I wasn't able to find any explanation of this rating on cryptocompare.com. What would it be based on?

I think that 24 words drawn from 2048 with replacement has 2048^24 possibilities, which is a couple of orders of magnitude larger than 2^256. Not worth worrying about, except among, y'know, nerds.

Both my Trezor and Ledger Nano S work fine with my MacBook Pro using each's Google Chrome browser extension.

Of course! I wasn't implying anything negative. On the contrary, thanks for a useful comment!

There would be no change in resources required. "Miners" would be mining only fees, not fees plus block rewards, but they would still have to create new blocks to get fees. Creating new blocks requires computation resources.
I put scare quotes on "Miners" because that analogical term was used by Satoshi in reference to the block reward, not fees, so the analogy will become no longer apt. I'm guessing that the term will survive, though.
