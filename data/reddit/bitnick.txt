Just got a reply from Bitfloor about what's holding the refunds:
"There is no hold. IAFCU is reviewing the docs and said they will start processing refunds within the next few days."
I didn't realise the ball was now entirely on IAFCU's court.

Has anyone received their funds? Mine are still pending on review by Bitfloor. IAFCU account open, all good there. What's the hold on Bitfloor? Any news from them?

Please don't leave it a that. Do share your thoughts.

I have opened my account with IFCU (it took a few phone calls and 3-4 days) and set it up on the bitfloor.com side. It is now under review there for the past 2-3 days.

Someone posted all sorts of accounts Roman has on the internet. I checked around and I have to say, I believe his is a cool, honest  person. My suspicion now is that he's on some sort of gag order from some gov agency for whatever reason and cannot talk about anything related to bitfloor at this point... again, just my sentiments.

I believe we should get a legal rep to dig into this mess for us and at the same time add pressure to resolve it w/o getting into bankrupcy.

I think the prob they are facing now is how to break the big check down and send us each our portion since they no longer have an account. Their lawyer should be able to resolve that. Perhaps they will open a trust or escrow acct and start mailing checks to us. We seem to be at the last leg of this mess.

I have $9,006.998 stuck with them and I believe it is time to put some legal pressure on. I PM'd you a few mins ago with amount and email for updates. Thank you!
