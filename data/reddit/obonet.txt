The drop is from 130 to 80... If i am looking now at MtGox it says 80$ for 1 BTC and in order to get to 70 you need to buy 2Mil $ worth of Bitcoins...
I can only imagine that from 130 to 80 was something like 40Mil $

NO! DDOS its denial of service, I actually think MtGox is enjoying this. The definitely allow it.... I wonder if they are actually doing it themselves...

i dont get the privacy of bitcoin. Everyone gets to see every transaction.
If i buy something from a store online they could follow my account and/or my ip to see where i buy next and how much.
Should i go around and create hundreds of wallets and move bitcoins around?
Should i also use a lot of proxy servers?
