Just recently bought at 11k for the first time. Woke up today, saw it &lt;10k, bought more. I won't be selling, and in fact will buy more if it continues dropping. 
I consider this the opportunity I've been waiting for.

"Bitcoin’s value directly correlates to the general stupidity of the human population. This is why it keeps going up despite being quite obviously useless nonsense. Never bet on the population getting smarter."
Sounds like you're just regurgitating something a famous twitch streamer said. Maybe if you actually knew what bitcoin was, you would realize something that does what a bank does without needing greedy, corrupt bankers overseeing your transactions is far from useless nonsense. 
But hey, without followers there would be no leaders. So do what you do.
Edit: Added quotes because it looked like the first paragraph was my opinion.

Wouldn't the Fed asking JPM to buy 2 companies basically consist of the same person, running around a desk and sitting on each side answering his own questions?
