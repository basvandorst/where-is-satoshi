You can go on block chain and search for 50 coin wallets and find thousands that haven't been touched since 2009

You have a horrible view of other people. You assume everyone will think it is a get rich quick scheme. Here is how it will probably go, Joe Rogan notices Joe Lauzon is sponsored by Bitcoin and says something like "Bitcoin, the only currency with zero fees and no middle men" and we capture the attention of millions of UFC fans. You would be hard pressed to find a developer that would be at a hackathon that doesn't know bitcoin.

When silkroad was suffering through intense DDoS attacks, it was probably the US Gov sending that traffic and then checking their exit nodes to see where the majority of traffic was heading

30,000/14 = 2142.857

Isn't 4-5% of usd spent on illicit goods? I think that someone will be able to take that 4%, the demand isn't just going to disappear
