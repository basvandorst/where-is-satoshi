You can't just leave that there and not expand a bit, story time.

Certainly a type of "beat."

Doge seems like the appropriate coin for this transaction, Doge will solve all their problems

They punch the holes on the top and bottom so that it's more difficult to make forgeries. With some of these design schemes that are overly simplistic they run into the issue of cheap knockoffs, costing fortunes in lost revenue.

Wouldn't that hold the whole block chain?

That's not what we are talking about, if some body attacks me to inflict violence, or extract proprty through harm I have the right to protect my self, those with me how I see fit. The attacker loses a lot of rights of safety when he decided to put my life in danger.

More than agree.

Our founding fathers took that freedom in 1776 and luckily we have been able to hold on to it.

Doesn't work that way, the victim is just as guilty or more so by defending themselves with violence. They don't have the same concept of self defense that we do.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:23:01
I am not sure you have much experience with this but a lot of the time by me these don't go to that point. Officer on the scene can make the determination. The laws of what constitutes an defensive action are pretty clear.
@_date: 2017-02-19 21:21:34


I should have elaborated, it's not the prosecutor and a jury that always finds you innocent, a lot of these cases never go that far. If the responding officer determines that you acted in the self defense then the case needs to not go any further. We trust that the victim would know the right amount of force needed to defend them selves. The assaulted party doesn't need to call 911 to get the go ahead.

Not all countries give that freedom.

But what opportunity it provides, we can see the money move it's only a matter of time until they slip up. hopefully.

Already worth more than it's weight in gold.
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:08:19
So the aggressor gets to set the pace of the fight? We find it better to let the innocent/assaulted party decide the appropriate amount of force to defend themselves.
