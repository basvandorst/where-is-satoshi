What software? With the hardware you mentioned you’d be looking at less than $60 a month on the most profitable altcoin. I’m concerned you’re being scammed.

My country is an embarrassment.

Support in what form?
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:05:31
bitcoin or convert-to-fiat?

You should look into seedboxes. I use Whatbox.ca, for $15 you get $350GB storage, 2TB upload, unl download. You have a webui for torrents, plus https, ftp and ssh. They also offer a free openVPN through the seedbox.
You can stream right to XBMC too, no plugins. 
Oh and they now accept bitcoin ;)

No it hasn't. It's had a copy made and peeled off.

You need to start thinking in terms of percentage growths rather than absolutes. 
Bitcoin in its current form is an investment, with all the related risks and rewards. If bitcoin doubles in value, then your investment has grown to 200% of original. Doesn't matter how much you had, it's still grown. As you earn more, you can invest more over time. 
An alternative if you're really into bitcoin, get an evening job like bar work and plow all the extra cash into bitcoin. Would definitely see your portfolio grow then!

You're not making any sense.

Transaction fees. And it's more of a gradual slowdown than a sudden stop. Look up mining difficulty.

Yea, humanity really has a strong record of nailing the first version of every world changing technology doesn't it!
Google looks exactly like it did 20 years ago!
The internet was always this fast!
Telephones always worked without wires!
The block chain is exactly like every other technology. It's created, observed, adapted and deployed over and over.
I mean shit, it's only in the last few years that we've been able to use telephones reliably on New Year's Eve.
The block chain and by extension bitcoin has a long, adapting future ahead of it. As challenges arise, so do solutions. 
"We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win"

As much as you can afford, and are willing to loose. The key to dollar cost averaging is the consistent purchases at each interval.

Remember the guy who mortgaged his house at ~$2500 to buy coin?
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:25:57
Lol.

Dollar cost averaging over a few months :)

You haven’t lost anything. Just rebuy the bitcoin you spend. You only made losses because you spent lower than you bought. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:52:15
yea, but why?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:53:44
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:30:10
I meant why as in, is there a shortage of nodes?, a shortage of bandwidth to distribute chunks? &gt;insert risk to network here&lt;? etc
