There is also [BTCregistry]( We hope to up the ante and welcome all who have the same goal - we need more (and better) ways to educate people about Bitcoin.

Great, now nobody will believe that it wasn't intentional. :)
P.S. Thanks. Fixed.

Funny thing is, Bitcoin is probably the only currency that started by actually being worth nothing and then slowly growing from there. $1242 bubble itself is the biggest speculative bubble in history even if you measure it from 2013 prices, but if you measure from the initial price below one cent, nothing comes even close. It will be very hard to best Bitcoin on that front, especially considering Bitcoin's first mover advantage.

We've now added option to toggle between log and linear scales. Will do some more UX testing to see if it makes sense to make it a default. Again, thanks for the suggestion!

Actually, you can.
Simply find your event through the search textbox on the site and bookmark (or copy) the link from the address bar when the site is displaying event you want to share.
You can search for the specific date when your event happened, or simply click on the graph candle for that date. Or you can search for the whole month ([2013-10]( or specific chain of events ([MtGox](
To make it really fancy you can use Blockchain of Events as a search engine.
In Chrome:
1. go to Settings / Search / Manage search engines
2. under "Other search engines" enter:
* "Blockchain of Events" in the first field
* keyword "b" (or whatever letter you fancy) in the second field
* and search string ` in the third field
From that point on, you can search for anything directly from Chrome address bar by typing, say, "b Silk Road".

Yes, of course. It's a nice piece of research and a good summary; our focus is more on events and original sources, but we've gone through it and used it as a sort of checklist to get ideas and see if there are some original sources and events that were missing on Blockchain of Events.

Thanks! Any additions and corrections are very much appreciated. Will consider log scale - I'm not sure how much of the general population understands log scale and what it's used for.

We are not selling shirts. We are selling research and journalism - a database of, so far, around 750 summarized and tagged events we deem important, manually filtered from approximately 30000 pieces of news.
It's OK if you don't find value in that. This is actually precisely what we're trying to see, if people find this kind of site valuable.
For us, important thing was trying to find a way to monetize this (and thus keep alive and up to date) that is not ad-based. Serving our customers directly keeps us honest, in contrast to ad-supported sites which are incentivized to produce as much content as possible so that they can display more ads. We aim to work on reducing content they are producing to that which is genuinely important.

[There you go](
But! If you follow [the original link]( and click on the "crowdfunding" button... there's a whole gallery.
No point in crowdfunding us though I'm afraid. T-shirts are sent to you without the model.
@_date: 2016-01-09 00:35:19
There are dozens of sites offering Bitcoin charts, but what is lacking on that charts is context. We hope to offer hand-picked, curated and tagged database of Bitcoin-related events.
@_date: 2016-01-09 01:14:52
Yeah, that's why we don't accept donations. With crowdfunding, we're basically pre-selling subscriptions which allow people to see the newest events and access extra features. Somebody can come and fund the whole campaign, and he'll get 2 year subscription, T-shirt and poster.
If we start selling what we publish, we lose objectivity and become worthless for our subscribers. As we are brand new site, we don't even have the luxury to profit from such a feat in the short term - as we are not yet an established source, nobody is going to find it worthwhile to bribe us for quite some time. (And afterwards we stand to lose more than we can gain as any gain is short-term and destroys the site.)

already gave you link to [Satoshi's last post on Bitcointalk]( The source of "moving to other things" quote is [Mike Hearn]( This was also mentioned in [this New Yorker article](
@_date: 2016-01-08 19:56:55
Not much data from those days, but that was [the first documented rate]( Reportedly [theymos thought it was too much](
@_date: 2016-01-08 19:12:01
The problem with that one is that it hasn't been updated in two years.
In essence, yes, but we're making events searchable, including the price information (What started the bubble? How did MtGox bankruptcy influence the price?) and have a lot more planned. For example, for quick statistics on what moved price the most, go [here]( click "show price data" and click on "Price Diff. in Percent" - we're trying not just to document events but also to compare them as well.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:07:17
Well, technically, before first person bought it, it wasn't worth anything, but yeah - my point wasn't that it started from zero, but that it started from very near zero unlike other currencies and assets. Even alts usually start with some sort of presale/premine which sets initial price.

Silk Road was extremely significant for Bitcoin price. The [Gawker article on Silk Road]( basically introduced Bitcoin to the public.
Silk Road bust of 2013 was the most widely reported Bitcoin story and while it caused flash crash, it also brought media attention which helped kick off China bubble and increased percieved separation of illegal activities and Bitcoin as a currency. This was not the sole reason for 2013 high though - [BIG pump]( started the bubble and China entered the market and that was the main reason for the bubble.
Silk Road coins were sold long after the China bubble of 2013 popped; while they were not sold on the exchanges, auctions had a huge psychological effect and irrational as it was, they did contribute greatly to bearish market of 2014.
So basically, Silk Road bust caused a flash crash, and then public awareness which contributed to the bubble, and then auctions indeed brought the price down. Although they shouldn't have if the market were rational, as none of the auction coins were actually sold in the market.

Glad you asked, here you go. Some of them such as National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment by US Treasury Department might not be "positive" but that is subject to interpretation. Or, say, British Banking Association which considers Bitcoin a threat to bank fees, it's hard to say it's a positive report, but it does say positive things about Bitcoin. :)

I've been trying to find UK Government Digital Service report you mention - is your link correct?
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:53:51
Thanks, those are great links you've posted!
As of the UK Government Digital Service, thanks for the CoinDesk link, I now see what they did - they should have linked directly to [the comment which does mention blockchain]( Not really a proper report though, just a note that they looked into it.
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:29:43
Yes there is. QuickBooks. [Since 2014]( They support [Coinbase]( and [BitPay](

Unless the Lighthouse is patched to support newest versions of Bitcoin protocol, nobody can run Lighthouse server.
I believe I was the last person to actually crowdfund with Lighthouse; at that point none of the galleries worked, Mike didn't accept new projects for vinumeris.com as he was planning to shut it down, and basically I had to run my own Lighthouse server to do it. Now the server software is outdated as well.
