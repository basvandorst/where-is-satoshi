This store is steps from Oxford Kitchen, where we'll be holding the first Brooklyn Bitcoin meetup! Dan is awesome!

Well I know that Dan at Lean Crust has sold coins to new people inquiring about it. He helps them get setup with a wallet and answers general questions for them. I bought a couple from him the day before thanksgiving.

Don't know where you live, but I buy Dr. Bronner soap from my local store that accepts bitcoin. Give them a shout and ask for Dan.

I'll try and post something on meetup.com, but if anyone has a preference on day/time that would be helpful. Getting really excited about having a place right here in Brooklyn!

Awesome! Anyone have any ideas as to how to set one up?

Best thing to do is ask for Dan, he's super cool about bitcoin. I know they've got a lot of scents for Dr. Bronner and different sizes. If you're emailing them or calling, just ask for Dan specifically and let them know it's in regards to bitcoin! Good luck!

I just set it up on meetup.com for Wednesday at 7:30pm. I've confirmed with Oxford Kitchen and they're ok with it. Again, 10% off for anyone that uses bitcoin, and there are several over places right in the area that also accept bitcoin. Hope to see some people there!

Sent Dan an email telling him I blew him up on reddit again. This was his response,
"Wow, really cool bud. Really appreciate it. There's been so many people asking about bitcoin now! I offered Lean Crust as a place to hold the bitcoin meetup group if you're still interested. Let me know. Thanks again Josh!"
You should get in touch with him. He's a really chill guy and has a few businesses that all support bitcoin. I have a lot of respect for the guy because I've been to his businesses since he first started accepting bitcoin back when he said he got laughed at by all the wall st investors. Who's laughing now
