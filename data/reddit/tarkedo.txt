Do you seriously think that people use bitcoin wallets like a savings account where they can dip from time to time to buy cheap stuff for Black Friday?
I mean, I can see that happening in the future when it goes mainstream, but there's no way a significant enough amount of people use it like that currently.

I think that, at this point in time, Bitcoin price doesn't depend on people microeconomies, but on big investors and whales.
But I would be very happy to be wrong here and find out that fluctuations in price are affected by people trends.

Lol at people using Windows to manage their crypto investment.
Lol at people who still use Winrar (freeware and not audited).

I haven't done it myself as I haven't moved funds to gambling sites, so don't take my word for granted.
But yes, if the ToS bans that, then you should move it first to a personal wallet first.

When was the last time that you opened it? It might have started that way, but currently it's pretty much like this sub with a slightly different cryptocurrency political ideas.

Not directly from your coinbase dashboard.

Unless they can find a private key/seed in his property or an exchange account he owns, nobody can prove he has bitcoin.
If someone "loses" their private keys, they don't have bitcoin anymore.
