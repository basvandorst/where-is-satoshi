They are closing and this is legal speak for, "Get your money out of our accounts or it is gone".
Many other credit based system use similar strategies, but they do not email you, just his it in the small print in the linked terms of service.

I had this idea, bit never actually put them together. I could not decide which  paper wallet service to use to generate the addresses.
Bravo, to following through with your ideas. The world could more of your kind.
Also, NFC tags are cheap and would fit nicely inside, but it would only be useful for transmitting the public key, so maybe not worth the added cost.

Good luck with that. (hashtag; impendingfailure)

In a pinch, when the price is spiking, they have been at times, the only sell available to US buyers. Maybe that will never be the case again, but I would say the rake you pay them, for the ability to buy on CC through paypal, can be worth it.

How would they know it was a coinbase transaction? Could it be an coinbase offnetwork transaction that coinbase still needs to push? In the past, delays like this were complete coinbase's fault. But, miners can be selective, so it could be certain pools are prioritizing specific transaction over others.

I agree. If one has a bank account and would like to sign up and connect that account to circle or coinbase, that is a better option. But some do not feel comfortable giving over that information or waiting for that to be set up. Therefore a service like VirWox is a valued service in the market for the others. 
Paypal cancels and steals funds all the time for all sorts of reason, most of which they themselves do not even know why. I would avoid using Paypal in general.
Other ways to use credit cards to buy crypto include  but they also charge quite a mark up, but that is the market at work.

No. I have not dived that deep. My experience with bitcoin only includes modifying and running a brain wallet service (mainly for my own use)  and mining using self-configured raspberry pis with minepeon  but would love to learn what you are about to.

Take out a bunch of code and add a few lines. Or you may be able to right this just javascript on a secure system, just for your own use.
This is not my thing, but I would look at bitcoind first, as it is command line, non gui, and thus easier to modify.
Oh and test on testnet first.

The mega in this instance was ~$500mil split three way, with half going to taxes and funds upfront, I was think you would net ~$150mil so you still have $50mil to live off of.

No. It is a .doc which does NOT contain the press release.
I opened it on my android device.

You could not buy in the open markets, right? You would have to organize private sales, or government sales. Or buy companies with large BTC reserves.

True, but what if you were just some naive kid who created a wonderful product, and sold it because you did not want that lifestyle and are roped back in by the pleas of admins you thought you once know, who were in fact drug dealer feds who rolled the founder of mtgox and current owner of silk road for $500 million and needed a fall guy, that being you?
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:59:04
Yes, but the point is not to make an instant profit (you already have $100mil), but convert USD to BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:40:35
Yeah it is a scam. I clicked the link too. But hopefully the fake .doc can not do too much damage on my android device.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:51:27
Go for it.
Search github ( for projects that started what you want and build off of those. You can then test your work on your own system, on a virtual system, a raspberry pi, or rent a server super cheap from Digital Ocean (

USPS, can not open without warrant, where FedEx, UPS, and DHL will x-ray and turnover without. 
P.O. Boxes and PMB (private mail boxes), keep shipments away from private residences.

Not unexpected.
On the encrypted laptop issue...
I thought someone came up with a linux gnome extension that tracks your eyes with the webcam and locks computer if your eyes are not looking at the screen after a short period of time.

It seems those old-timers do not care about the millions.
