and no. most people in third world countries dont have 5k usd cash. you are living in another world.

I think it is real. I visit this sub without being subscribed to it. There is a of interest  in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:35:58
Does Coincheck or any other exchange provide insurance? Or is it like "LOL sorry, we got hacked and lost your money. better luck next time?" If it is the latter, they are probably not getting hacked, they might not have the money to pay people once they want to cash out.

He is not taking millions from people. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:20:21
When you mean you sold, do you have the money in your bank account or is it in the wallet/exchange? How fast can a transfer from bitcoin to $ be made? I tried to get in but it looked as if it was going to take forever to get in(2 weeks) so I wouldnt imagine how long it would take to get out.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:34:33
LOL Checkmate? You cant even keep the story straight. Between crossing a border while being shot at,  with cash or bitcoin, cash will win 100 percent of the time. This is what makes people think bitcoiners are crazy and deluded. YOu cant think straight. There are circumstances where cash is better than bitcoin. But good luck to you.

Describe insane. If I wanted to send someone 100 USD in bitcoin, about how much in usd would the fee be?
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:31:44
If Im running away and into another country I would prefer to have 5000 
usd cash in a plastic bag. Fee less and accepted almost anywhere. keep in mind thst nost people in a thir
d world country wont have that much money.

A company that manages multi-million dollar transactions should have top notch tech support agents. They have plenty of millionaire customers so they should be a lot more on top of what they are doing.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:08:43
i do have skills. but the reply was to have either bitcoin or
another currency. You are braver than me. you will stop and learn a trade while being shot at crossing a border.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:56:19
now i crossed the border. iwant to see you bribe a guard
 with bitcoin lmao. ill be alive whe i pay him. you will get shot tr
ing to explain to the guard how to use bitcoin, when 
the transfer will be complete
if it goes into the ledger. youll get shot by that same guard while the other person paid and went through.

every post here is propaganda.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:38:26
Im interested in knowing how you would explain to the guard that you will send bitcoin to him. A guard in a border has no idea what it is, so explain from zero. It would be a very interested read. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:18:37
with accusations that the price has been heavily manipulated in the past I dont think interested newcomers will be interested in getting in.
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:59:58
 But there are many problems with this, some of which are actual unsolved problems in computing generally, and some of which are generally held to be unsolvable.
Could you provide a link where I could learn more about those computing problems.

Old but smart idiot. Probably wanting to tank BTC price and buy it on a super dip. This guy is pure evil.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:24:24
because with that comment he is trying yo get new money in.
@_date: 2019-02-12 04:17:22
Everyone who buys btc has to tell others to keep buying. The only way to get your money back is for other people to put in their money.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:12:44
If you are charging 2btc but declare only 1btc then it is evasion. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:47:49
He might not be referring to the artistic quality. It is just a shitty non existent excuse for btc to be down. Nice drawing but stupid conclusion.
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:03:41
Wait a week and it will probably be 10 percent off.
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:01:33
Exactly. If people haven't used btc in the last 5 years they should be shamed when they use it later.
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:36:31
You are too awesome! Thanks for everything, it is easy to get lost with so much info online. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 03:10:12
Yes, they will all be financially independently financially.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:35:25
Great explanation. Once it is in GDAX I can send it to other wallets (wallets provided by binance, gemini, etc ) and just pay the network transfer fee?

There are more than 1 million people there who will see this. The price will surely go up. HODL
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:09:02
Yes. It asked me acc and password but didnt felt comfortable. Ill do tge deposit method which takes a bit longer to verify. Thanks for all the help.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:52:34
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:14:36
Thanks for your quick reply. Is GDax a wallet? Can I send from GDAX to other wallets "cheaply". My main concern is opening up an account and everything, and then finding hidden fees or similar things. I'm still learning a lot so my questions will be all over the place. Thanks again for replying, I'll research more and will ask better questions. Thanks man.
@_date: 2019-01-01 03:29:41
Yeah, they should be held accountable for whatever is written on their pages. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:44:29
Yes and many more people bought in at 20k and now are fucked up. They have also changed the way they walk. From your question about the border I can see you have never crossed a third world country border. there are people with bulks of cash ready to exchange to another currency. You buy it off them if you need the currcy for the country u are entering. They currently dont accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:54:34
Hey abdada, where exactly in coinbase do I set the ACH? is it where it says link account, or do I wire transfer the money to them? I have the account but dont know where to go. Thanks man.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:21:37
I like this idea. I dont mind if it takes 4 days, I'm not trying to time the market. Two questions:
Once the money goes through from ACH to CB/GDAX. Do I have a coin, or I have the money in my wallet in GDAX as USD waiting for me to buy a coin? 
If  I want to partially cash out, is it possible to do so through cb/gdax? 
Bonus question: If  I want to change from BTC to USD but not cash out, just have the USD in my wallet ready to buy again, is it possible or I need to buy tether? 
Thanks for everything. I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:55:46
Read Googles TOS. They probably hace something there to protect themselves from this.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:59:46
Yeah, matt damon isnt even a vet.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:51:38
awesome. creating and linking coinbase atm. Can I write to you later on (once everything is verified) for some tips? thanks u/jpknz and u/abdada you guys are great.

@_date: 2018-04-06 22:10:40
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:23:04
Don't even try calling that number. It is a scam, they'll probably call you back later trying to extort money from you.
@_date: 2018-12-08 05:17:34
I really don't know if the experts would or not. But you are acting as if you have more inside knowledge than a billionaire who could hire any one at the highest fields.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:51:29
You should have a website or show because your predictions were spot in. Enjoy being a millionaire you deserve it!
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:35:06
The only people who have lost in bitcoins are the weak hands that sold. Everyone else is waiting on a new ath.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:38:10
Yes, he could also manipulate the general public. But my point is that either way he does have way more access to bitcoin/blockchain knowledge than you even if you know coding and he doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:55:54
They are milking this Time Magazine Opinion for all its worth. It was a super pro bitcoin guy who wrote the article as an opinion piece, not that Time Magazine believes it.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:05:23
Quit trying to change the subject. I don't know if he is truthful or not, but you stated that he didn't know a line of coding therefore his arguments were invalid. Call me a troll and keep living in lala land. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:30:52
I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:44:58
He doesn't need to know any coding, he might not have knowledge but he can hire top coders and experts to come to his conclusion. He might be completely wrong but you are judging him way off.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:40:00
Very positive vibes. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:54:09
Did you make them out of shit?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:11:29
You are not an idiotic but I'm not sure businesses will pay for it. Try doing one for free at first to see if there is interest. They might like it and pay for the next one.
