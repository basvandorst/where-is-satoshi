Honey,  I just don't feel like giving you a handjob today.   It's okay, just put the robot hand over here and run the automatic hj program.

That's unbelievable! Much gif. Wow.

It's not up to me to validate your argument.   You provided two separate sources for your numbers,  however they are 20 years apart.  This comparison is tenuous at best.   I'm not questioning the legitimacy,  just the 20 year gap. 
If I were trying to make a point about the number of programmers versus the number of people driving cars for a living,  and I used the number of programmers from 1994 and the number of drivers from 2015, it would be a very questionable comparison at best,  and it would be hard to draw any useful conclusions from that.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you at all, I'm saying that I think a 20 year gap in data is bad for your argument, and you could do better by finding a more recent source.
My analogy wasn't meant to disprove your premise or your argument, it was merely put forward as an obvious example on how data can change in 20 years.  You say it's obvious there are more programming jobs now, and that's the entire point of the analogy.  I was only trying to point out that data can change very significantly over 20 years, its purpose was not to disprove your premise.
You are getting extremely defensive, and I'm only pointing out that there should be much more recent data than a 1994 source on ADR deaths.

Using a 1994 statistic vs a 2016 one isn't very good.  It's very likely that the 1994 numbers have dropped, as hospital outcomes have generally improved in the last 20 years.

I would agree that those numbers don't make sense, but you also have to realize that he's using 1994 numbers for the 100k and 2015 or 2016 numbers for the overdose deaths.
Hospital outcomes have gotten better over the last 20 years (less deaths total) which means that those numbers have probably dropped.
