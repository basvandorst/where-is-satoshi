Thanks for your positive contribution to this discussion, Ideas come before the code, you know.

No blockchain. The **[Bit451 Database]( uses a light, embedded distributed database, modified for P2P use.

Thanks for your feedback. MediaGoblin was considered but determined to be unsuitable for Bit451's needs. There are tons of great projects out there but some of them just aren't a good match. Do you contribute to MediaGoblin?

Hey, I appreciate your saying that and can understand the sentiment. Here's some food for thought... if someone like me comes up with creative solutions (i.e. "specs") to existing problems and posts them here asking for feedback and support, everyone who does offer feedback and support can positively influence the project, bring it to life faster, etc, and the ideas can improve other projects in progress. If on the other hand I were to keep the idea to myself and try to develop the whole thing in my free time (while being employed full-time, etc), it would take much longer, wouldn't have any (often very insightful) community feedback to incorporate, and any of the good creative solutions would be kept from other devs for much longer. Doesn't the former option seem much better?

So FreeNet in darknet mode is an out-of-the-box competitor to YouTube with user accounts/profiles/channels, favorites, ratings, subscriptions, recommendations, etc, streams BitTorrent, and does everything else Bit451 seeks to?
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:29:02
This sounds like a great idea, and it's also a good reminder of some of Bit451's goals, like "improve and reuse other open source projects as possible" and be "decoupled from specific [technologies] as much as possible". The more crossover appeal, the merrier; being "plug-and-play" with different protocols which accomplish a similar goal is another goal to provide more choice for users.
One question which comes to mind is, does Storj support streaming content? If not, how hard would that be to implement?
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:42:44
Actually I'm a computer scientist and software developer, it's just that it's much easier to get a solution to market faster and more well-rounded with help from the web community rather than all by yourself. Thanks for your helpful contribution to this discussion, have a great day!

*EDIT:* Yes, Bit451 will provide an [interface to be interoperable with any P2P file sharing network/protocol](
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:47:29
Thanks for the heads up!

Well-thought-out post. I believe there are answers to most of those questions (explicit or implied) in the white paper, which I will address in more depth in an ensuing post. But I did want to respond to this quickly:


I would love for this entire project to go under the Bit451 moniker, but if a dev chooses to steal the idea and run with it on their own independent of Bit451, that is fine (they would not be eligible for any Bit451 bounties raised, of course). The most important thing is seeing these ideas come to fruition, because they will make the world better.

Addressed [here]( but in short, MaidSafe is fundamentally different from Bit451.
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:04:23
No worries! Bit451 can be thought of as a P2P file sharing overlay network. The originally planned network to overlay is BitTorrent, but it has evolved to have crossover capabilities to bridge multiple different P2P/cloud file sharing protocols like Storj, Freenet, MaidSafe, etc. Bit451 will provide the ability to create user profile/accounts/channels, index media content across said protocols, favorites/ratings/subscriptions/playlists, etc.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:37:04
Thanks for your feedback. MaidSafe was considered, and while it is certainly exciting and promising, it was determined to be both fundamentally different enough and unfinished enough to be not yet suitable.
There is some (relatively minor) overlap between Bit451 and MaidSafe, specifically that they both have a Distributed Data system. But even at that, the execution is sufficiently different. Bit451 only replicates data within intentional "communities", so your node only rebroadcasts the data from accounts you like ("subscribe" to, etc) and other nodes only rebroadcast your data if they like it. In this way, data is only replicated to the extent that it is considered valuable by those who want to host it.
But more broadly, the focuses of Bit451 and MaidSafe are just significantly different. Bit451 is specifically a media network with media-related attributes, design, and functionality. MaidSafe is a general data network which eventually, potentially, Bit451 could be adapted to work within, along with Tor, Freenet, I2P, etc.
To be fair, this rationale probably should have been included in the readme, and most likely will in the next update. Hopefully this addresses your concern.

The conventional "view count" is not used in Bit451. Content's popularity is ascertained based on its Favorites/Ratings. Subscriber counts (as Bit451 other data) are based on the community of the viewing user, since your community are who you trust. If your community is set to the entire Bit451 network, you will get the count from the entire network. If your community is set to 100 friends of yours, you will get the count from them instead. What this means is that good communities drive niches and, well, marketplaces, for Bit451 site hosts. Caching, btw, is already built-in to the Bit451 Database.


Users can find videos either by browsing videos from their own community, or by browsing from hosted Bit451 sites (through which Accounts/Content are easily added to their own community). Related Accounts/Content are found by exploring graph depth (Bit451 uses a GraphDB with vertices and edges).


Ratings, like subscriber counts, are community-based. So the integrity is based on the integrity of your community.

Ok, I'm going to answer these in logical groups:




Comments won't be added until at least Phase 3, and until such time, Bit451 site hosts wishing to enable comments have many options such as Disqus. The comments system would be best implemented so as to be usable as a standalone system. Anyhow, here are thoughts on that:
Users' comment sections will naturally be sparse until they have built up some level of community interaction, just as other networks. As for combating spam in comments, users will have the (both Account-level and Content-level) mode to a) enable from all (except Ignores), b) moderate from all (except Ignores), c) enable from my community but moderate from others, d) enable from my community only, e) moderate from my community only, f) disable from all. Additionally, Account-level option to defer to Content-level mode (default) or force Account-level mode Content-wide, and Content-level option to defer to Account-level mode (default).
Moderators can be assigned with similar abilities as the owning Account.

Beautiful, Bit451 will already use JW Player since the Portal (frontend) is a MediaDrop fork. A bit of further consulting/cooperation with you guys would probably be necessary when the time comes.
A proposal to add this to the white paper will be submitted shortly, after there has been time for discussion :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:48:11
BitTorrent, Freenet, etc can be abused. Also, cheeseburgers can be abused. It's not the elephant in the room, it's just a non-issue, especially since Bit451 doesn't actually host the files (BitTorrent/etc does that).
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:31:13
Isn't the **[Bit451 Database]( subproject (OrientDB fork with somewhat minor modifications) exactly what you're talking about? It is an adaptation of an existing open source distributed database, specifically for generalized P2P use. In your opinion, what are the benefits of using your recommended solution (Freenet?) as the database, how do they outweigh the proposed Bit451 solution, and how do you envision that being accomplished differently?
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:51:09


Addressed albeit extremely briefly at [Anonymity]( this is a Phase 3 functionality and something that should be discussed in depth among the Bit451 community until then. We have plenty of reference points starting from [anonymous P2P]( [I2P]( (end-to-end encryption), Tor, etc. This refers only to the Bit451 Database data, of course.
The media content itself comes from the various P2P file sharing networks, so anonymity at this point is the responsibility of each network and/or the client used. The user has the option to select the networks they wish to access.

WeTube and Bitcloud are addressed towards the beginning of the white paper, thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:34:07
Because being a generic data application like Chrome or BitTorrent isn't the *point* of Bit451. Replacing YouTube and other centralized media sites is.
