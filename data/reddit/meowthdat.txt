I would need to see a miners income sheets.
If you’re holding an asset that pumps 10% in a day, and you’re bullish on its future value, then you’re liquidating as little as possible to take advantage of that.

Not sure that "majority chain roll back" is an actual thing.
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:08:26
Whys that relevant? No single party is capturing 100% of the newly mined BTC, and miners aren't liquidating as soon as they get it.

Its almost like you didn't watch the video.
He doesn't mention wealth distribution or anything of the matter.
He uses rich people as an example of people who say they don't need crypto because they are privileged and out of touch with the needs of majority of the world.

Profit in the form of a dividend?

It's a fire risk because the cardboard is obviously very, very flammable. All you need is a hardware malfunction and the miner can easily get hotter.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:20:29
lol your enclosure for it is a cardboard box?
are you trying to start a house fire?

My wires have taken more than 2 weeks on occasions (CAD wired to Japan) but lower in value so I don't know how much dollar value is prioritized

How does that take away from his argument? He didn't say "rich people are clueless". He's saying privileged people (not just wealthy people) don't have a need for crypto because modern banking solutions solve their problems. And that's why they believe crypto is not useful. The winklevosses are obviously privileged, but do not believe that crypto is useless, given their investments.
And so if you're someone who says crypto isn't useful, it might be because you have the benefit of living in a society where a lot of problems are already solved for you.

Like do you think he stored his private keys in plain text somewhere? Or they cracked a password on his wallet? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:58:36
How did the FBI get his private keys?

You mean In-Q-Tel? Omg I’m on a deep state watch list now

Confused was to why people think this is a useful graph. Its not particularly useful to compare fiat currencies (and money supply nonetheless) to assets.
Japan is ranked  Why? The US has a far bigger economy and GDP. And the USD has more buying power.
Comparing gold to btc in USD is more useful. But comparing a nation state's money supply to the market cap of BTC tells you nothing.

Saving is important, but let’s look at earnings.
Real wages are recently flat not because of inflation or devaluing of currency, but because globalization (competition for jobs) and change in corporate practices (maximizing shareholder value over taking care of employees through pensions and job security). We simply live in different times.
More saving power won’t help the middle class in the short run. Automation will change a lot in a short time period, and so it may make sense to help society adjust to those changes.
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:11:30
Too bad you’re too paranoid and scared to share any more information. If you can google these “secrets” it’s not a secret. 
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:10:08
Seems like separate issues.
UBI addresses the shift from manual labour to automation, and redistributing the gains from those improvements to society so that it isn't just capital owners who benefit.
Suppose your country ran on Bitcoin. That's not going to stop people from losing their jobs to automation.

Heh you seem very educated.
Did you know governments take tax dollars and fund police, fire, education, libraries, roads, electricity, etc.?
Ugh socialists am I right

A lot of people don't even know about the halving or how block rewards work. 
In the time leading up to the halving, excitement/chatter/coverage can definitely spur upward momentum.

You could just post links and names of organizations and people rather than quoting ‘Deep State’.

Oh ok, everything is priced in and nothing ever changes, just like stocks

On my Mac I'm stuck at block 33000.
On my Windows its stuck on block 4000 and seems to go up by 1000 every time I close the app and restart it.
Do you think I need to reboot my computer?
@_date: 2019-04-27 22:59:33
Got stuck on syncing to chain, definitely feels alpha

Any company would be better off using a database on a server. Decentralized via nodes competing for prizes gives the network its security.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:42:48
Its the same thing isn't it? You still need to find local buyers, or an exchange that doesn't ask for your personal information. Unless you mean keep it in monero forever.
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:02:46
I can see cryptocurrencies/blockchain technologies in the "long long" term as a good bet, but given the rate of technological change, why would you be so confident in Bitcoin itself being around 50 years from now? Very few things last that long without being disrupted.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:49:35
Are you using the word "exponentially" in a literal mathematic sense, or figuratively? Because the year over year change in world population is represented by a very weak exponential value, making population growth not a very "exponentially increasing" figure.
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:27:33
Does more BTC on the network add more value to the network? Or is all we really need is more nodes?

What’s a plunge protection team
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:42:42
If they ever want to do business in the US, yeah
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:01:13
If they didn’t give a shit they would just service US customers illegally anyways.
It’s a huge market, and one day they’ll want a piece of it.

I don’t think Ethereum cares about replacing Bitcoin. It’s purpose is to be a decentralized computing platform, and its way better at that then Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-03 02:48:43
Enough for what?
I like Ethereum and Monero and think they are better than Bitcoin in a lot of ways in terms of different features.
