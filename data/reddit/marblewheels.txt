Reading this sub in the past I got good advices so yes I like to hear the morale around :) Of course I am not basinf my decision (already taken btw) on what people tell me here. Have been in the game long enough to know that forum and subreddits are to Bitcoin what financial newspapers are to DowJ

Hey guys, for personal reasons (kid is expensive....) I gotta sell 0.15 Bitcoin. Should I do it right now or wait a few days? :)

I invested quite a while ago, care about other things and now want to sell some. Btc with its staggering growth ended up making my portfolio kinda unbalanced so I want to fix it. Still it is really clear to me NOT to invest in crypto more tham what I can afford to lose overnight and this is not the case. But thanks for the reminder, too many people forget about this! :-)

It basically is a way to tel people: this is no get rich quick scheme. This a technology/asset/wathever that can POTENTIALLY be absolutely revolutionary. It may fail or it may win, probably not mucj of a halfwau. Nobody has a crystal ball. LEARN ABOUT IT FIRST and THEN invest/bet on it STRICTLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE OVERNIGHT. Sit back ad enjoy without freaking at weekly fluctuation, it will take some time.

Why instead of seeing plots againts us we simply recognize that the fees ARE way too high?!?! 
This is like not recognizing that we have a flu due to going out without a jacket and attributing it instead to "chemtrails". I`m holding onto my BCH.

100% agree with you. But how many of the people who got into BTC in last ~3 months know the difference (let alone the tech details)?
