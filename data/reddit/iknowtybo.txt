Why would that be risky? With the help of the internet there are various workarounds. Along as someone is willing to trade goods in exchange for bitcoin u/Bitcoin_forever would be able to survive.

Remember, also that fiat currency (USD) have been used for scams/illegal activity for ages. 
Drug dealing is a good example.
Also why would employers need to have access to your financial history in order to be hired?

Bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is **no** **government**, **company**, or **bank** in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

Give [Bitbays]( a try. They are a global bitcoin exchange currently focused on the spot market (USD/BTC &amp; CNY/BTC). They have something called an arbitrage fund, basically they take advantage of different prices between the different exchanges and pay you a cut of their earnings in return for having more capital to conduct arbitrage with.

The fees go to the miners to incentivise them to keep mining, which in turn keeps the Bitcoin network secure. 
Fee are required to make sure that a particular transaction will get included into the next block which is generated.

Your **TL;DR** reads differently.
I think it has a lot to do with the novelty. Said another way "Its a new way to do everyday things."
Example: Buying Groceries using Bitcoin.  
In my case much of the similarities to the current system are disregarded because I am my own bank. IMO Bitcoin offers more control and a safety net in the event of the world currency crisis.
