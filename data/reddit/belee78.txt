I promised my GF I would have a lambo by this summer, she is going to dump me if not.  I know... but she she is out of my league and this is my only way to hold onto her.  
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:33:27
Tether!!! might be more like it.  We all know its going to fall below 8k shortly, but that small hope that it might spike back up is keeping us hanging on.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:44:57
In Asia definitely with a C.
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:44:41
Well I guess i'm happy, thought when I woke up we would less than 8k.  
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:41:20
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:22:08
I'm hoping to get a used Ford Pinto out of this.  
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:14:00
Bottom is 0.  Top is unlimited.  Their is a limit too how much you may lose, but their is no limit of how much you can win.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:39:17
One year ago today Bitcoin was around 2.5k.  For it to fall down 3k and to hold around 4k\-5k is more likely. That would be about a 100&amp; increase from last year and Bitcoin would still be moving in the right direction.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:11:30
At this pace we will be trying to test the resistance at 8k again shortly.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:58:34
This is the lowest volume I have seen for Bitcoin on Binance in a long time.  Is this a good or bad thing?  Maybe half the market is in tether waiting to see the next move, I don't know.
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:57:04
We might actually need to reach that territory to break 10k.   I don't make the rules, but it's just how it works.  
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:21:36
I think it's spelled pressurice.  Anyways, I got my seat belt on.
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:48:17
Look at the list of companies that will be attending.  Tens of millions would be like chump change.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:33:55
Just get it over with and crash to 3.5 k and still stop wasting our time I am tethered and want to double up. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:14:56
This is our bread and butter of the year.  Major companies, huge investors, NYC wanting to become the global capital of blockchain.  Tom Lee is still standing by 25k by summer and said he wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin shoot up 10%-70% during the conference and continue surging in the following months.
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:30:50
You never know.... it might just take a few hours to be back in the green.
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:26:10
4pm in New York lets move on from this Concensus gathering.  Hopefully, when these big companies and organizations go back to the drawing board Monday they will decide to invest.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:29:49
Welcome to the club
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:11:18
Man, I feel exactly the same.  
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:23:08
Never been there is it a big state?
@_date: 2018-05-17 20:56:33
I prefer New Balance
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:12:27
I don’t think we will get that lucky, but maybe 6k.  I’m just waiting for my time to buy back in not feeling it right now.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:22:34
I ain’t going to lie I do feel like a bag holder.   Sometimes I have gut feeling to sell and be safe with my hard earned money, than the market teases you by making a little period of recovery only for it to be taken all away in one dip.  I’m so deep into this investment, Sadly, I would actually feel better to lose everything  rather than walking away now because I still believe in the future of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:09:06
Weak dip.  Boring... if you gonna crash make it fun.
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:13:54
Hip hip hooray 5900 again.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:46:09
5k-6k would be good for the future of bitcoin.  Short term we would lose, but long term more investors = new fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:41:51
Haha this is the greatest post ever.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:56:33
Let me be the first to say it.  6k never again.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:20:53
I’m going to up the ante 5900 never again.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:22:29
@_date: 2018-06-24 01:37:39
Time to test 6k again.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:30:37
Anyone else waiting for Consensus 2019.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:00:31
Next years Consensus conference I’m going one up you and say 9k.  This year is not going to be what people think.  Bitcoin needs a good 3-5 years. We are at the dial up stage of early internet.
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:34:41
Just got rejected from 7700 for the third time.    Two other times it came close but didn't touch.   Between 7700\-7800 is a tough wall, we need to break 8k to safely clear this obstacle.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:46:31
It's only money, if we lose we lose but at least we tried.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:31:48
Even if it falls to 5.5k, Bitcoin is still almost doubled since this date last year. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:51:13
That was yesterdays news lol.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:06:36
Hurts less when you check often and the fall in price is gradual.  On the other hand if you check weekly it might put some people into shock to see a 500 dollar dip each time you check.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:22:54
I hope so I really don't want to go below 6k.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:08:49
I might not have the lambo but if I cash out now I can get some rims.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:21:20
Not really because most of us got in at well above 10k.  I probably speak for the majority of us by saying if today was our first day in bitcoin we would be so much better off.  
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:56:43
I'm cashing out at 10 dollars, want to get at least a 6 pack of beer out of my 10k investment.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:44:47
The owners of lambo dealers must be pissed.
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:29:21
I don’t like to gamble 
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:56:01
Somebody has to be responsible for my losses, this is getting ridiculous someone has to be held accountable.  I’m writing Donald Trump going straight to the top.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 23:13:50
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:24:09
Your actually winning in the long run.  No maintenance fees, registration, gas, insurance etc...Wow someone actually won with Bitcoin amazing.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:25:49
I’m routing for Italy.  Ohh wait they didn’t even qualify��.  Yeah I’m still pissed.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:43:49
We on the moon yet?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:18:49
FUD?  I lost all respect for you man.  Wishing to stay a little above 7k during bearish market is the furthest thing from FUD.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:34:11
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:03:27
I know right, we need Dennis Rodman in here. All I can do is hope we are still 7k when I wake in the morning.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:28:55
Houston we have a problem, lost all thrust on our engines.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:05:14
That was actually 2 Saturdays ago, but yes it was nice.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:39:43
Maybe we have to accept that this is the price range bitcoin has settled at.  It's fighting like a champ to stay above 6500 yet quickly comes back down after getting over 8k.  During this bearish market I would gladly take the median average of 7250.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:44:23
If it crashes to 1 dollar or if it takes off again to 20,000 dollars who cares, its just money.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:05:40
99% of FUD post are people who are speaking on their emotions.  When the price goes up we are going to the moon and when we crash its the end of the world.   Sometimes people are down and need to vent to be reassured everything is going to be ok.  We are all still a minority investing in crypto, lets look out for one another and keep this train rolling.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:54:50
Slow steady climb boom big drop, slow steady climb boom 24 hour low, slow steady climb boom panic attack, slow steady climb loving it boom hate it.  I'm settling down, only check every couple minutes now back in my early days I used to check every second.  Wait its gone up from 9300 to 9423 since I started writing...wait wait 9424..9421...strap on your seat belts 9426...ok need to take a break i check in 2 minutes.  
@_date: 2018-07-11 05:57:40
Money is evil, yesterday In my heart I deeply knew when bitcoin floated around 6666.00 just like it previously before going down under 6k their was more to this then just investing.  They feed on our animal behavior and how we neglect families and friends from losing money and losing control of our kind hearted soul and inner peace.  Wake up everyone they are coming for you.  Be strong and brave and be kind to all.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:44:23
I was one of them so you should thank me.  I only said it because always the opposite of what I say happens.  Reverse psychology.  8k never again... 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:52:41
It's going to be over a million in several years no doubt, now 20k  doesn't look so big does it!
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:54:52
Somebody give me a xanax, we are back under 7k.  I'm freaking out over here.  Hopefully the extended release version.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:06:31
Yeah its tedious, but yet it's comforting in a way as well.  I think very soon (next hour or 2 hours at most) we are going to see a super duper candle, I don't know which color.  But I'm making my first prediction ever it's green and it will take us back up to mid 8300's within 2-3 minutes when this candle starts.  Final answer I'm locking it in.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:53:52
I am, just trying to make someone laugh/smile even if the joke is on myself.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:24:38
Remember just a couple days ago we were all happy it was 7700.  We are still hanging tough near 7900 after that dip, its a roller coaster ride but we are still trending up.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:35:55
Maybe people are hodling.
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:07:14
Just bought another 3 hundred dollars of bitcoin, that next big green candle is on me.
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:34:56
Yeah, I just saw that.  I didn't know if that was always there that I missed or something new.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:06:16
Yes Lambos are overrated, that's why I'm getting a Ferrari.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:35:56
I agree, we are barely holding on but most importantly still holding on.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:38:35
I think many of us are itching to do the same, but just holding onto the possibility of a rebound.  It's really a hard choice, sell and watch it take off or sell and breathe a sigh of relief as the price dips further.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:39:48
6450 got swallowed up but was able to push back a little in the process.  We need to keep above this mark currently 6468, not much room to work with.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:13:27
I'm going from a Lambo to a Ford Pinto.  At least, I'll find out if my Girlfriend is a gold digger. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:30:05
Hopefully the new model lambos are out by then. Lol 
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:53:50
"One day"  
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:06:57
That was a nice dip right before bedtime, I had to check lol.
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:12:25
Just got off the phone with the lambo dealer and told him my down payment wouldn’t be ready til next month.  “Thats funny” he said, 5 others just called and said the same thing.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:20:29
I see a great moon everyday when my fat brother bends over to pick up his playstation 4 controller.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:52:33
I was all depressed when I checked my phone this morning and saw bitcoin tanked another 2 hundred.  But after staring at the price and my senses slowing coming to me I was like holy crap it’s not 6700 it’s 7700. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:18:52
Yes sir.  Blockchain tech is going to transform almost every aspect of our future.  Bitcoin is the 4 star General /Admiral  with alt coins being a mixed bag of high ranking officers to recruits. It doesn’t matter what we say or think, Bitcoin is going to be worth well over a million one day and we have to pass 30k to get there.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:25:15
Enough to make a winning lottery ticket today look like change.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:06:44
People are selling like crazy on binance.  Hopefully the other main exchanges are opposite.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:54:23
If we hold onto 7k through Sunday, we might have a chance to 7.5k.  If we fall back to 6.5k before the end of day, it will be another week climbing back to 7k. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:50:44
Here a song for my feelings toward bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:39:51
So weak, if they gonna make bitcoin crash stop with all these pussy amounts.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:21:41
We are like a Great White Shark approaching their prey.  First we give 8k a little tap with our snout to inspect and we fall back just a little before coming back full blast for the kill.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:58:36
Man is there a great wall at 8200 or something?  I think is super important to stay above 7800, this is our safety net before going much lower.  If we can go sideways here, I believe we will gain momentum and try again 8200 again.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:52:55
Let out some bitcoin tension.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:57:15
I never thought 6500 would be a comforting price.  I make funny faces when its 6499 and at 6500 I'm able to breathe again.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:09:17
I gave in.  Tethered up at 6700...with my luck now watch it go up.  It's kind of weird now actually wanting bitcoin to go down.  First time taking this route.  
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:41:43
By December maybe half of that...Merry Christmas to all of us.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:08:55
Are you guys serious?  No one knows, it's my personal opinion...Want me to make a youtube video and draw some lines through the chart to make it believable?  
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:05:31
That's like you and me spending one dollar.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:16:32
Is this considered a dip or a crash?  Being it has went down around $850 dollars since yesterday.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:25:17
I would bet on it being 8500 before dropping to 4k.  Than again I bought in when bitcoin was 17k, what do I know.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:08:51
Ahh, I have never opened up kraken before.  I'll check it out, I check Bitfinex and Binance myself.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:41:30
Yeah, but aint they like 3 days ahead so it would be Saturday over there.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:29:32
Losing with bitcoin is kind of normal but have that security of hodling.      
Fomo is super real by doing this, but Ill play it safe yet be patient to re enter.  Yeah kicking myself a little because I wanted to do it at 7k but greed and thought iy was going on uptrend kept me in it. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:03:10
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:23:01
Time to test our mighty wall at 6500, this is it cross your fingers.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:49:09
If you held this long you will be selling at the possible dip.  Very true it may keep crashing, but if it bounces back it will hurt more to re buy at a higher price.  Don't let the game play you.  Bitcoin is only going up, these price manipulations are mind games that will make the rich richer and keep the average man down.
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:37:31
You might have to buy them a round of drinks, but hey what you going to do when its only 19k by July lol.
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:32:22
googled it, that's deep.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:52:40
Everytime I sell, it almost immediately makes a big arc.  I freak out and don't want to miss my flight to the moon so I buy in at a higher price and before you know it, it's back to my selling price if not lower. ...And this is all within 15 minutes but seems like an eternity lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:31:24
We are getting close, one big green candle and we are right there.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:02:41
We need a medic in here to stop the bleeding.
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:30:15
Whew that is a relief, I was thinking it was headed toward 1k-1.5k  range.  
@_date: 2018-04-26 02:31:51
I ain’t going to lie.  I work for a company with a decent amount of employees and all my co workers think I’m a retard ( I sort of am a goofball and retarded in my own way but anyway) for investing into crypto.  Same ole questions and comments what backs it? it can crash to nothing tomorrow etc.  I really want to one day roll up in a lambo and see their faces drop.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:31:19
Golden tether compared to now.  All due respect for that move.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:08:01
Ok, things have settled down, but that was fun.  Lets take a minute 5 break and let my blood pressure equalize and lets do it again.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:55:24
I know right, I thought orange chicken at Panda Express was addicting.  Bitcoin takes it to another level.  
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:27:16
I ain't going to lie everyone, I'm scared.  I'm not ready for the moon, I heard it's infested with aliens.
