That's exactly what people who hold lots of bitcoin would say, wouldn't it be?  
"Hey you schmucks, go do something to make me richer while I do nothing"

I'm currently in a fuckin big old battle with them... I was verified, lost verification, e-mailed support, was re-verified without providing anything else, got some $ sent to an altcoin wallet, went back in a few days later to send it to my local wallet and I'm not fucking verified again.  And now they want face shots &amp; different IDs.  Fucking ridicuous

You're telling me that coinstar isn't gonna accept coins for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:49:03
My $1 coin and my $1 bill are worth the same.  
Fuck coinstar, and fuck coin.me.  They're preying on the poorest members of society.  Coinstar already steals 12% of your change for a fee to get cash.  And then another 4% to coinme.  Then they turn around and sell your info for even more money.
KYC is killing bitcoin.  Big names that steal poor people's money like coinstar is not a benefit.

Ohhhhh man, that could have been a $3.50 joke so easy too.

Once I get them out of there, I'm done with them.

I guess if you wanna play this stupid game, absolutely nothing happens instantly.

Or you would call a lawyer for a free consultation, and if they believe you have a solid case and a good chance at winning, they will offer services at a certain % of the $$.

That's not how storing value works.
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:16:44
it depends on where you keep your gold.

How exactly did that value hold from $20k to $4k?
