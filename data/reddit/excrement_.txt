The ruling class doesn't give a shit about the environment, champ. They're still going to be in charge when the world turns into Blade Runner. 
That doesn't even come into this though, this incredibly and hilariously retarded deal is a great example of wealth redistribution under the guise of fixing the climate. With some intersectional bullshit word salad peppered in there for the millennials at home. Not only are these measures logistically, logically and financially impossible, they won't even improve climate change in any tangible way. It's just an insane manifesto on collapsing the US economy and turning society into an anemic lump of shit with no global influence

Funny, I was promised in 2016 he'd start a nuclear war with Lil Kim. Didn't pan out. But I don't imagine your condescending ass learned anything from that election, since you're still quick on the trigger when it comes to insulting and generalizing groups of people

Now I'm not saying everyone who hangs around Culture Cunts is a douchebag.
Just that most of them probably are. Based on observation. It's definitely targeted at "sneakerheads," kids and wankers

Except BTC only has one use and the technology behind it is obsolete... altcoins have nothing to copy in that sense.
The only reason for adoption is that it's always been the biggest, and on everybody's minds. Everyone hears about the big jumps. The momentum is shifting though.
The scammiest, dumbest shitcoin can do what BTC does, probably better. It will be dethroned soon and this whole subreddit will just be looking for things to blame until the end of time
