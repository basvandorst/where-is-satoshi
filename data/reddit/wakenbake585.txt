Saying you wouldn't touch something with a 10ft pole pretty much only has one meaning. Its has a pretty negative connotation.

Rip off finger nails and toe nails, get the tat on the fresh skin and wait for your nails to grow back over

Odd to put a quote from a man who said he wouldn't touch bitcoin with a 10ft pole.

Why can't you use binance?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:59:07
Ouch.  Smart though.  Look at coinbase as an example when they continue to accept new customers although they are clearly drowning in issues already.

If you plan on holding for 6-12months, I would move them to a secure wallet. If you plan on holding for a boom then selling, they are fine on coinbase/gdax. Just nake sure to set up google authentication and what not.

All the morons who upvoted this didnt even bother clicking it... what a sad sub
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:28:46
I don't think you read that correctly. Im also not salty,  I hold myself. My point is take any advice with a grain of salt. Especially with crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:57:17
 Ripple is centralized. That's why.

I bet 90% of the fucktards saying hodl only have $100-$300 in btc. Id say half the ppl are frauds on here just following and jumping in the comments pretending theyre losing or gaining. 
PS: hodl is a stupid fucking saying.  HOLD.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:41
You've lost over 20k the past two weeks? Just stop and hold until you learn more about trading. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:25:03
You can probably ignore 99% of ppl trying to give advice considering 99% of given advice is "hodl"and thats it. Its so overused and unhelpful.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:14:39
Great. I'm talking about ppl asking for real advice now. Its pointless to say it and its the mostly the response ppl give. Not everyone is in to hold and they make that clear in their post yet morons still respond to just "hodl.
Hodl is also just stupid to say. How about hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:03:18
Coinbase says right on their website they do not allow any incoming or outgoing transactions to gambling sites and they can ban you or restrict you for it.
There are also a few posts on reddit spanning back to 2014 about ppl having their acct banned after sending btc to their wallet or attempting to from gambling sites. Just google coinbase gambling. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:11:19
Can we ban the word "hodl" please. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:21:29
What dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:36
Absolutely. When it dropped to 10k, coinbase wouldn't leg me sign inm kept saying error had occurred and we're looking into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:03
What. . Lol

Says it takes 3-5min to get verified agter sending pics.  Here I am 20min later with nothing.

That's what I like to do. I enjoy giving deals to other people.

Sorry, while I had gdax.com opened on my laptop and signing in, I went to coinbase website on my phone to verify my account, it texted me a link to take pictures of my ID and then said to go back to the computer to verify. It didnt do it the first time but i refreshed the page and then it said 3-5min to verify but ended up taking 18min.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:17:01

Salt is good for you in small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:39:51
Well. I just got verified literally a minute after i sent that but now my fucking account is suspended and it says coinbase is under heavy traffic and may take days to respond if I email them to fix it. I changed my name the other day on the site thinking it wouldn't affect it but apparently after getting verified on gdax it does?
I went to gdax on my phone and took the pictures of my drivers license, then it said to go on your computer and finish the process.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:50:58
Volume is still really pathetic on gdax

Yeah man. I heard he plummeted about 14000ft. His body lays at an inaccessible area around 6400ft on the mountain, completely frozen. May he rip.

@_date: 2018-03-04 00:22:58
I think it can hit up to 25-30k if there is huge news about it and its blasted all over the news again. I don't see it staying there for more than a few hours/ a day tops though. I think an average price though will be somewhere between 10-13k. 
Just complete speculation.
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:56:01
They have had it for months now. I tried selling something and never got any interest. I also have never found anything being sold on craigslist that accepts crypto in my area.

HODL is a stupid saying and always has been.

I wonder what places will actually accept the card though. Amex isn't even accepted at a lot of places.

This is much better on silent. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:19:27
So does this mean funds and any coins you are holding could get locked if coinbase/gdax gets seized ? As in we'd be SOL?
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:58:53
I know its unlikely but they definitely have a lot against them.  Will be a shit show
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:40:37
Fair enough.  Thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:36:20
I trade so I don't usually have anything for more than a few hours unless it crashes. I'm more worried about having some on there one night and waking up to a seized site. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:38:08
Well.. if this doesnt drop 2k+ in the next half hour.. you owe me a btc rich boy. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:14:30
