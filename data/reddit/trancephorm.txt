all altcoins are scams? you're deeply wrong, bud...
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:24:43
what can i say... yes it's too big of a scam for some people to believe, but eventually you will all believe in the future
@_date: 2014-12-17 09:57:52
now its only left for sheeple to realise
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:35:53
in case you haven't noticed i'm not either bullish or bearish, actually it's all pretty much confusing right now whether it will go up or down.
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:59:07
maybe still not yet, but it's showing that bitcoin can function as a money - so it's stealing the function from traditional fiat which is nothing else but fraud. they emit money on their own terms. that's 1+1 bud.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:15:54
Market cap has nothing to do with potential of some altcoin. Forgot to add PPC too on the list.
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:43:55
well... not exactly. bitstamp is holding my money, won't let me withdraw for no good reason, for about 7 days. and i'm already a verified customer, made withdraw before..

Number of transactions has nothing to do with innovation. I said already what I consider to be significant innovation, that is anonymity, and no one seems to even think about implementing it into Bitcoin. As far as I know last big thing were multisig transactions, yes it's useful, but anonymity is far better improvement, which is useful to more people.
Correct me if I'm wrong but lifting the 7 txps limit would mean slower confirmation times also?
I tend to play with altcoins because if nothing else I see innovation there contrary to Bitcoin, and bubbles rising here and there, I'm not nauseous to making some good investments.
I don't care about the price as I'm aware of the big financial worldwide scam which effectively puts human kind into slavery. You can believe me or not, but I would really love to see Bitcoin rules the online payments and person to person transactions. In the meantime, it wouldn't be bad if some bucks are earned, at last, we who are advocating Bitcoin use are taking risks and if it succeeds, that's what we deserve.
@_date: 2014-12-26 13:31:36
Benefit is that price keeps more steady easily then and the rest of the people would get more easiliy persuaded it's the future.

That's another problem. In modern society, unemployement should not be a problem. Automatization brings new freedom to people. That's what they made you think employement is so important, but actually they enslaved you, but you know what they say: the best slave is the one that think he isn't.
So... fact is that we're living in hyperproduction society, but those hyperproduced goods are not available to everyone which is illogical. It would be better that we chillout a bit, lower the consumption and live a kind of modest, more spiritual lives, not having to work to survive. With this state of technology, it's entirely possible, but you guess, that's what elite doesn't want to happen because then they would loose power.
Simple as that, but I don't believe you comprehend all of this, yet I must admit this is a bit of utopia with so many sheeple areound like you. ;)
Here you are:   ... try to understand why this society is sick to the full extent.

Don't wanna ask you, but I wanna suggest anonymity is one of the most important properties of crypto and it's still not natively built-in in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:39:50
Yes, bitcoin does address inequality since there is no authority which generates money at will, everybody can do that. Maybe it's not 100% regulation of inequality, but sure it's better than fiat.

Oh how smart your comment is. Please tell me where did you learned your flawless logic thinking?
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:13:38

What a fucking NWO puppet. He deserves death.
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:21:06
Fact is we don't need government issued money. But since you asked, I think they would do it on separate blockchain to remove unneeded risks of Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:16:43
The goodness that Bitcoin could bring to this world is much greater than: "Help Stanford University scientists studying Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and many cancers by simply running a piece of software on your computer."
At last, cure for cancer is regularily found in alternative medicine, the thing is mainstream medicine wants to sell medications.
When you heal your spirit, you can heal any disease you have.

All of that falls in the water if receiver spends his Bitcoins online, not converting them to fiat. There are really no fees then, and I think we should be aware of that option. Bitcoin IS money.

Credit cards not working in Serbia yet and when I asked why they said:
Thanks for reaching out!
Many of our international users have been successful linking international credit cards issued through Visa or MasterCard, however at the moment Circle only supports linking US bank accounts and credit/debit cards.
We strongly believe that Bitcoin is an innovation that is global in scale. We are working to incorporate international partnerships that will allow customer worldwide to send, receive, deposit, and withdraw bitcoin. We can't provide a timeline for when these services will be available, but in the meantime non-U.S. customers can use Circle to send and receive bitcoin in a fully insured account.
Let me know if you have any other questions in the meantime.

No I wasn't expecting a complete victory of Bitcoin. I actually don't expecting complete victory of Bitcoin at all, all I wanted was to emphasize the ignorance of people, as a factor for slower adoption. I just wanted to say that better things does not always prevail and to express my fear Bitcoin will grow larger just a little bit more than it is now...
Bitcoin price is direct reflection of Bitcoin importance, I'm into Bitcoin for liberitarian reasons firstly, that's what attracted me, profits are my interest, but secondary one. What I have done? If nothing else, I spent countless hours educating people about Bitcoin, live and on forums.

@_date: 2014-12-16 12:10:07
Because we're in bearish trend for almost 1 year now, and the price almost dropped to previous ATH which is kind of psychological barrier. Don't forget good things are coming: seemingly affirmative regulations, ETF, OpenBazaar, ChangeTip (already there) + anticipation of 2016 reward halwing + possible worldwide financial crysis (which would push price the most, among all of these factors).

@_date: 2014-10-06 05:35:35
That much coins for the ridiculous price of 300$ is a very good chance for some investor to get a hold of a fortune. I do wish to remind everyone here, another bubble is very very close because there was so much positivity around Bitcoin recently and also maybe some buds here forgot Bitcoin is the most important invention in history, since Internet.

Starting to think Ethereum overthrowing Bitcoin is possible outcome. Ethereum, from the start, was more thought-of project, with world-class programmers in the same league as Bitcoin's. Also, don't forget its gigantic IPO (second big crowdfunding ever), if this money is spent right - there will be an explosion. I'm so glad so far I've invested heavily.

if someone converts to usd that way, i do think he wants to push the price down, just to rebuy at lower price, and not to cash out. i think that's legitimate behavior having it's own risks, no profit is guaranteed by trying to manipulate market, because what if stronger bull emerges right after bear whale sold, he pushes the price up.... bottom line, manipulation can't always work, and people love to say it's the main factor for irrational price moves, they need some reason.

Windows is worth hating for myriad of reasons.
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:01:37
Facts:  
- Linux is free  
- One-liner update of kernel, drivers and programs  
- Almost non-existant viruses and malware  
- For average user, using it for web browsing, multimedia and copy-pasting of files, nothing is THAT MUCH more complicated than Windows - in fact, it's even simpler in many cases.  
- Lower resource consumption  
So when I tell these facts to Windows users and they still don't want to switch, and in the same time they even do have some Bitcoins stored - there's no other name for them than "sheeple". Sad but true, bud.

You're forgetting USA, Russian or EU miners. Mining technology may be bad in energy consumption aspect, but still, anyone can mine and it is truly decentralized.

how do you think you will get it cheaper right on the start? people won't be willing to sell it cheaper than they bought it, and 26% inflation is really not too much if the project takes off. i invested in it also because i believe vitalik is one of the best minds out there, he has both technical and economical background, he is just a type of guy focused on success, and he has plenty of smart articles around.

Maybe you should try first to explain to them in what kind of financial matrix we live? For me, that's the primary reason I love to use Bitcoin, because it's one very positive move that removes financial chains. Actually it's complete parallel and much more healthy economy.
Also, you should mention fairly fast transactions with no fees, no borders and no middle-man.

Yes I did to some extent. There was nothing that much positive there about cryptos. They even didn't want to touch the economy aspect of Bitcoin, as far as I know... they talked only about criminal use.
We should not circlejerk around here, you're in big misunderstanding if you think USA government is going to praise cryptos. Cryptos, as a good economy, is eating bad mainstream "economy" as we have it today.
My guess is that USA is going to do the same as China, but question is just when? Ofc, nothing can kill cryptos, but they can slow its rise and mess with the price.
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:56:39

Such advantages like decentralization and lack od central issuing authority must come with some risks, but IMO, those problems are easily solvable...
Security - encrypt wallet with long passphrase, do daily backups of wallet.dat file over network, to at least 2 machines, use Linux cause there is generally no malware for it. Don't use online wallets. Paper wallets are also good option.
Chepness - BTC-e comission is 0.2%, Bitstamp.net's wire transfer is enormously cheap: 0.09%. There are even lower rates than these... You can even find someone through localbitcoins.com and frequently there's no commision there.
Speed - can agree that can be a biggest and hardly solvable problem because of the p2p networks nature, still, connecting some Mastercard or VISA card which you can easily load with dollars from online exchange almost practically makes you actually spend coins, and you can't forget the fact that the number of merchants accepting cryptos is in enormous increase, you're already able to buy anything with coins...
Anonymity - connect from Tor network and you have absolutely nothing to worry about.

it seems like no one covered these speculations from a very important viewpoint. those big companies are under direct and strong influence of us govt, so given the fact bitcoin is disruptive technology to their usd ponzi scheme, i don't think they will bw allowed adopt bitcoin soon. in the other hand, i do think smaller companies will adopt it faster and faster, getting the bigger and bigger cut from big ones, so in the end, when they become smaller player, they will adopt it.
@_date: 2014-10-28 07:58:14

Rise we saw in 2013 was insane, and this decline was expected. We need to wait so Bitcoin becomes more dispersed, and then it will start to slowly rise, and if some financial meltdown happens, that will fuel another bubble. Also block halving is coming in 2016.

I don't see point in centrally issued crypto-currencies like XRP is. Apart form that, if I understand good, Ripple's network usage is to facilitate bank transfers and be a platform for assets which is nothing too helping or revolutionary. It doesn't solve the core problem which is emission of money in democratic way. Also, I tend to believe Bitcoin's network is capable of doing whatever the Ripple network can.

Since there has been much sideaction lately in ~200 area and since miners are not much profitable selling their coins - I think it's time to get in. However, always beware of early-adopters cashing out, actually they are so wealthy they can suppress interest which is getting bigger day by day.

good read. i think evil forces are divided: part of them realising they cannot fight the natural revolution of finances - thus gaining their own stake in bitcoin - hence we see such articles from mainstream/manipulated media. part of them will fight it until they lose, all in all i think few years will pass until bitcoin replaces gold, and even decades will pass until it replaces fiat for regular purchases. we need salaries given in bitcoin for that and that won't happen anytimo soon.
@_date: 2015-04-11 17:04:21
no because there are no consumers still... as i previously said, consumers will come only when they receive salary in bitcoin, average joe is too uninterested to convert to bitcoin for liberal reasons and there is actually not much incentive when you buy with bitcoins.

merchant selling acquired bitcoins is just a tiny portion of sold bitcoins. we should thank this drop first to early adopters and then to miners constantly selling them. at last merchant adoption is not that much important as preservation of value which will truly shine in next financial meltdown which is just around the corner.
@_date: 2015-04-27 10:04:59
good but until wages are not paid in bitcoin, we won't see massive bitcoin adoption. it will be used more as a store of value and remittances currency. financial collapse is when bitcoon will start to shine, and that will happen soon.
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:28:50
evil forces cannot fight the natural evolution of finances, but i think decades will pass until cryptocurrencies really get trraction and we feel positive economic effect because of wide usage.

Global consumer adoption will go parallel in Bitcoin salary adoption. Most are too ignorant to exchange for Bitcoin, only geeks are doing it these days. More important things are preservation of value, remittances and micropayments. Bitcoin may go bubble mode any day now.

serbia is not in sepa, but regular old swift wire transfer works in 4-5 days and it's just bit more expensive. bitstamp, kraken and btc-e wire transfers work. other option is localbitcoins.com but there aren't many sellers/buyers there. no atms, no other ways to work with bitcoin.

sepa is not working in serbia. swift works and it's a little bit more expensive than sepa. so swift or local bitcoins.com. there are no atms in serbia still.

First of all, who told you deflation is inherently bad for economy? Can't be bad because it would prevent enormous spending of the West like it is now. Consumers always want more and more, hence they're getting fat, ignorant and zombified. Enormous spending is much more bad for people than normal spending for what they really need.
"So we could afford to fight some World wars. We would have lost otherwise!!!"
And it's good that USA is fighting those wars, right? West is bad as it can get. We're on the brink of WWIII thanks to wrong finances. Issuing money is number 1 problem in the world and right now it's completely broken and needs fixing.
Healthy economy is the one that does not need any kind of regulation and manipulation. Fiat money, right now, worldwide, serves as an instrument of enslavement. Instrument that is making rich richer, and poor poorer.
Sorry bro', right now you're victim of brainwashing, these are basics everyone on planet Earth should understand, please re-think your views. We need critical mass, and we need you also. ;)
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:47:00

Point is, what you really need... you will buy it now if you have money. At last, that "natural" deflation surely won't be high. I guess it would be pretty low (actually proportial to change of number of persons using that deflanatory currency), so wouldn't be much worth waiting anyways.
On the other hand, forcing enormous spending (and production) brought us to insanity where western world dumps every kind of goods including food, and 3rd world is lacking the same.
Emitting money without any backing by anything is nonsense by itself, actually that's why it is a fraud, because top of the pyramid is converting work of regular people to slavery, devaluating it. That's in my opinion much more dangerous politics than deflation.
Bitcoin is surely not the answer for inequality but is a damn good step towards, because rules are same for all and everybody had a chance to join and still has. It's philosophy is centuries forward compared to fiat economies.
2008 crash was caused by system-wide fraud, and such crashes are inevitable. Bitcoin is much less intrinsically manipulative because everyone can (or could) mine, rules are the same for all, you don't have banksters elite which are mostly just enjoying benefits of that system-wide fraud.
Thinking of a perfect system - yeah that's really a tough task with many many implications to every field of living, but I think maybe [resource-based]( economy may be the good start. All in all, human race should even spiritually prepare for such stuff - because we're fucked to the bone in every kind of way possible.
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:35:35

I always wanted to hear how the price is "manipulated" exactly. If you think about pumps and dumps - those are risky for pumpers and dumpers, so it can't be called manipulation. Something that may be called manipulation (or theft) is Willi bot for example, or goverments issuing fiat just to buy crypto.

Yes I opened a ticket but there was nothing else I can say in that ticket except to say they are pricks which are banning my ip addresses and even tor exit nodes. Site was keeping on rejecting me, I barely managed to write my ticket.


You should really read my case carefully. And you can have your own opinion, I don't mind, but one thing is clear to me, they banned my IP for absolutely no reason, they tried to forbid me to login there.


I sent USD to my friend which joined the site recently. It's not "as I want" because they tried to forbid access to my account.


I'm not on dynamic IP. I'm not using any software firewalls. I'm on Linux, I don't need that useless Windows crap. Me I did not do any funky shit with my system, OKPay just ceased to communicate with me. And I'm not from yesterday, been using computers for 20+ years now, I'm professional, and I'm connected to Internet from its beginning.


Possibly, Chromium has some kind of internal redirection when it can't communicate with site, that's what I think I has been redirected to some generic ad site. Firefox was giving blank page with 200 (OK) http headers. I don't have any spyware in my system. I don't have problems with my DNS, not with any other site at the moment.


Sorry bud but I have given up on Windows crap many years ago.

ppc bud. explosion expected.

that's bunch of bullshit. remember this when USA really starts fighting cryptos. they won't let THEIR economy fall so easily, cryptos are threat to them.

It's easy for merchants to accept Bitcoin when conservative prediction of BTC price is "at least 2x worth in few months".
That is really making attention among merchants...

you call this crash? price almost recovered fully after few days. no regulation can make cryptos dead, only some heavy technical flaw!
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:47:35
plus million brother.

I will explain what they did. My guess right now is that they have a good lawyer team which concluded there's not much I can do about it all, and they decided to steal my money.

only from tor + 3 tor ips are blocked too.


yes. just like that. sneeky bastards.


seemed so, still i'm ok with the version to rips were blocked automatically. but what about my regular ip?


i'm wanna-be.. haha you made me laugh :)) btw, using windows just for relaxation called bf3 and occasionally at my job for outlook purpose.

It's like you say, I admit it - "I was stupid not joining in earlier". Well, my story is similar, but a bit different - yes I made about $20k  with Bitcoin, but since I remember the day Bitcoin is launched, I could be good probably around ~2 mil ;)

Wasn't keeping any Bitcoins there, just USD. Managed to move them logging in from Tor network only.

this reddit is full of jerks

"Regarding the Crash that happened yesterday and is maybe still ongoing, I think the problem for people is they have lost faith in currency."  
While I like this post very much, I can't agree on this: majority is just surfing the wave and rebuying at lower price. Remember, Bitcoin is still at least 95% speculative, 5% useful buying instrument. That will change ofc, but it will take time...
People generally have faith in cryptos!

i think they may be nwo outlet and they just wont do it
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:06:54
Is it possible people here are so fucked up this has 9 upvotes and 7 downvotes?

Firefox is getting worse and worse by time. I think some big interests are involved. Finally, we will see... I don't think it's THAT cumbersome to implement Bitcoin donations!
@_date: 2013-10-30 09:12:03
I'm doing it regularily. Raising awareness is good thing. Soon Bitcoin is destined to become mainstream, volume greater than Paypal. I can bet on it, it will happen in 2 years, and there's just one requirement: Bitcoin to be technically alive. No financial regulations can stop it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:34:14
and you're ignorant prick.
