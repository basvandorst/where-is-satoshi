Plz do !
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:02:00
The trades are executed instantly, so you will have the funds in whatever trading platform you use. Withdrawing those funds is another story :) can take a month+ with some exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:09:19
Things are very busy right now, all you can do is wait it out.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:27:55
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:25:30
Bitstamp, BTC-e, Mtgox, Kraken are the most used for day traders. 
I have sent you a PM :)

PayPal, Visa, and anything reversible is rarely accepted due to fraud.
There are a few methods to accomplish this but the fees are very high.
For PayPal there is Virwox, for Credit Cards :  and a few other sites.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:46:46
I know both AsiaNextGen and  are in HK, I am researching the exact banks now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:58:04

@_date: 2013-11-28 08:17:18
Any BBQcoins ? lol
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:11:50
This needs to be taken up with mt gox, this seems to be an issue with their side.

I am aware, a few of the sites that have a lot of volume are very clunky. Looking for personal preference here.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:19:16
Reverse transactions that he sends while he’s in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations.
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:10:50
Thanks ! entered
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:48:09
Congrats !
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:08:23
I personally just go to the site on my phones browser. Might be an option, more of a hassle but it is secure.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:42:42
I have been using them, no problems so far.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:00:35
Great idea !
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:34:03
quickbt.com if you are Canadian :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:17:56
Good on ya.

This is not the place to beg, try @_date: 2013-11-29 01:06:04
It is down for me too. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:15:54
It is still very difficult to get USD out of Mtgox...
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:43:08
I have not used this app but I saw this on their info page :
If you have only set one password the thief will be able to access your funds. Because of this we highly recommend you enable "double encryption" which allows you to set a second password that is required before funds can be sent from a wallet.
To enable this login to your My Wallet account in you browser. Click the [Account Details] Button then the [Security] tab and you will see an input box for your second password. Remember to make a note of both passwords somewhere, as your wallet cannot be opened without them!
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:03:47
It seems that you might be Canadian, as you are using Cavirtex. Give Vault of Satoshi a try (
They verify in less than 12 hours in my experience. Otherwise buy locally if you can.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:31:40
I find Kraken to have the most features for day traders. BTCe is sketchy lately, they have been receiving bad publicity.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:32:01
Check out this site : 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:11:02
If you are in Vancouver there is also the ATM.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:58:27
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:40:10
Congrats :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:39:46
Thank you, I'm going to follow his Twitter :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:48:40
No fees do not increase, the only way fees increase is if it is done manually by yourself to increase the speed of transfer.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:55:30
Uhm... please go away.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:57:58
They are most likely very busy and trying to catch up...
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:56:26
just sent you 5BTC ! enjoy !
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:07:30
My advice is to read more about BTC before investing. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:24:15
I will buy via paypal if your interested.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:12:11
Miners are unable to confirm a transaction on their own.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:28:28
No worries, where are you located ? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:54:27
That's not enough BTC to cause a panic.. if you have 5-10 for sale sell them to me ;)
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:53:21
It is not worth mining unless you have ASICS.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:28:09
The reward comes from transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:41:16
quickbt.com if you live in Canada :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:15:16
LTC is classy and here to stay.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:57:45
MtGox is problematic from what I have experienced. I would give Bitstamp a try.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:58:38
Congrats man !
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:30:58
I am shocked !
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:59:04
May your $5 RIP
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:01:48
Check out Virwox. Huge Fees but takes PayPal.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:51:28
I will begin digging through landfills daily for abandoned hard drives.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:00:52
I don't believe you.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:05:53
There still is a risk involved. Just don't put your life savings into something so volatile if you can't take losing it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:10:44
Yes true, I had my account frozen this week.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:01:07
so awesome of you man !
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:14:57
They would of been worth nothing, since no exchanges were in place and no buyers...
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:19:48
My education, and because I try my best to answer BTC questions :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:34:00
You may buy Bitcoins by somewhere accessible in the Philippines : 
No issues selling, and you may purchase fractions of BTC. Profit is a gamble,prices change constantly and any advice given is purely speculation. In my opinion a very good gamble :)
Feel free to PM me if you have any questions !
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:33:20
It is safe to publicly post your wallet address :)
Feel free to PM me any questions you may have.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:13:47
Withdrawal fees and problems surrounding will make things not in your favour.
