Capital Gains implications 
Tax Avoidance vs Evasion- How to avoid evasion in the ATO’s eyes. 
Record keeping for me has been pretty shoddy, tips on what is a “must keep.” 
ICO investment Accounting - Profit &amp; Loss 
Loss, is it something people should document to claim or will you have liability for CGT on initial value of investment
Profit, again documentation; on just profit crypto or everything- Tax liabilities etc
I’ll sleep on it &amp; see if anything else comes to mind.

Yeah, but the nerd voice inside said your helping secure what you made you your btc. 
If I didn't listen to him in the first place I wouldn't be mining to start with :)

I can imagine.  Damn carbon tax ;)

That whole hindsight thing crosses my mind every now &amp; again. If I had bought @ ~$17 when I paid for the BFL I would be a richer man for it… but the long winding road was still fun :)

Lol. 
Garage is heated by BFL :)   Damn things to noisy in the house.

Wouldn’t you divide the guessing not multiply &amp; then it works out ~571 years for your 5 missing words. 
Throw enough compute power at that &amp; it’s achievable. I’m not sure if my maths is correct but 5 doesn’t seem so bad, obviously gets exponentially longer with each unknown.

There can be only one…
Respect though :)

I’ll be crying more over the 5btc I burned on my motorbike back in 2013…
Either way I’ve had fun :)

+1 on Independent Reserve. 
Cashed enough to buy my new car, though they do KYC &amp; report to AU gov so you could be up for tax implications.
