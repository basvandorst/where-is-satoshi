FDIC insurance allows banks to take on greater risk, reaping any rewards of that risk but socializing any costs.  Essentially we pay when a bank loses and break even when a bank wins.
With FDIC insurance depositors have no incentive to avoid banks making riskier decisions and likely are actually encouraged to deposit at those banks due to the higher interest rates a riskier bank is able to offer.  Meanwhile a more conservative bank loses out because they are bearing some of the costs of the riskier bank through their insurance payments.
Just because it is easy to quantify the harm to a depositor of a failed bank but difficult to quantify the harm an uneven distribution of risk causes to the economy and society does not mean that harm doesn't exist or is insignificant.

Every time there is a spike in price, this subreddit is suddenly full of experts on day trading, technical analysis, and timing the market.  Instead of focusing on the things that actually give bitcoin "real" value-- building up the infrastructure around it, merchants beginning to accept it, helping it become more accessible to newbies, etc.-- there is just a total obsession about price.  
None of this shit works- it's how people lose their shirts.  Worse yet is any negative sentiment is pretty much completely driven out of the sub, and people that don't really know what they're doing get swept up in it and buy more than they can truly afford to risk at a ridiculously inflated price, only to find themselves the greater fool a few weeks later.  Most circle jerks on reddit are at least harmless, but the ones on have real life consequences for many people that get caught up in them.
The Spartans Hold bullshit is essentially the epitome of this-- it is just one massive circle jerk encouraging people to ignore what is best for them individually and instead let groupthink take over.  When was the last time you saw one of these with good, concrete reasons why the current price is justified? If you got into bitcoin-- or any other investment for that matter-- to make a quick buck, get the fuck out now because it is not going to end well for you.

Bank of Cyprus was already Cyprus' biggest bank.  From Cyprus' standpoint I would say yes, it is too big to fail.
For most of the rest of the world I don't think the entire country of Cyprus alone would be "too big to fail". The reason people actually give a shit about Cyprus is because it's a part of the eurozone.  There are concerns of what Cyprus dropping the euro would mean to the rest of the eurozone, as well as concerns about bank runs in other countries such as Spain and Italy (since depositors may now be worried that the same "deposit levies" could happen to them).
I should also add that Bank of Cyprus is not getting off scot-free, uninsured deposits there are expected to be hit around 40%.

From what I understand btc-e has much higher transfer fees, which are priced in to the exchange rate.  So even though you can buy bitcoins for cheaper with btc-e, the cost to get your money to them in the first place to do so is a lot more expensive.

First of all, when you trade stocks you are dealing with a broker, not a bank.
Second of all, the 3 day "cooling off" period is called the settlement period.  The buyer of the security does not actually pay for the security until the settlement date (the end of the 3 day settlement period).  So if your broker were to give you the cash before settlement date, they'd essentially be fronting you the money for that period.
I'm as fed up with the banking system as anyone else here, but I don't think it helps our cause when someone complaining about how their "bank" won't front them money from their stock sales is followed up by 10 different "me too" replies.. just makes us look dumb or ignorant.

Even when you decide to pull the trigger, it's not as easy as you might think.
Coinbase is extremely unreliable... and if you don't have an account with a bank that you can verify instantly, you'll be waiting 2-3 days before you can even try to get some from them.
If you want to fund Mt. Gox through Dwolla, you have to verify on both, and Mt. Gox took me more than a week to verify on.  Even then, transfers from Dwolla take 3-4 days.
So know that there will be probably at least a 2 day delay (if you are lucky) between when you decide to go for it and when you can actually purchase them.

I don't think you are going to find this anywhere.  The problem with buying bitcoins using a credit card is you can dispute/chargeback the credit card transaction a while into the future, where as bitcoin transfers are final.  So there would be too much risk for someone to accept a credit card payment (that can possibly be revoked) and give you bitcoins (that they could not revoke even if you revoked the credit card payment).

Cold storage... could be a flash drive hidden away somewhere, even just written down on a piece of paper.
Also, anyone who even owns just a small amount of btc should at the very least have their wallet.dat encrypted (very easy to do with the bitcoin-qt client).  A lot of people will also point the entire client's data folder to a TrueCrypt volume so whenever the wallet is not open it's essentially encrypted twice.  This way even if an adversary were to gain physical access to your PC holding your wallet.dat, they still wouldn't be able to get at the BTC.

Laiki Bank is being wound down.  Insured deposits &lt; 100,000 eur will be "safe" while a large percentage of money above the 100,000 limit will be converted into "bank shares", which at this point are being considered practically worthless. Right now depositors at Laiki Bank are expecting to have 80% of their deposits &gt; 100,000 eur converted to bank shares while depositors at Bank of Cyprus are expecting to lose about 40%.
It is not the bank that decided to do this but ultimately the Cypriot government.  The reason they are doing this is because the EU et. al. have required Cyprus to raise a certain amount of funds to assist with their bailout.  The deposits haven't actually been converted at this point, but they have been frozen so people can't withdraw them before that happens.

Well I have to say it's not exactly comforting to know they're struggling filling even super low orders.

Also, I've been trying to purchase more bitcoins from Coinbase for the past two days, starting at when they were still only $58.  Despite 50+ tries, was never successful.
We've both transferred money to Mt. Gox using Dwolla, waiting for that to show up.  Will not be using Coinbase again.
