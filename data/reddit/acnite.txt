Nope, not my first time. I did get the fraud alert and confirmed the transaction but I'm still getting a message from coinbase that my bank has canceled it. Shitty timing that my bank right now has a long wait time for phone calls and chat isn't working -_-"

Bitcoin? Watch plenty of videos on Youtube one you get the idea of it I would watch videos about exchanges so if you ever want to trade into alt-coins you can. For investing in general you'd want to look at investopedia website. One step at a time is what I found to be helpful because there is so much info that you need to take in. Cheers!

That's a valid point. It's important to have discussions because it will make you a more informed investor and when you pull the trigger on anything it can make you feel confident on your choice no matter how the market goes.

GDAX is back! Hold on to your seats!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:59:52
Yes and No. They are the same company but GDAX is their exchange comapred to Coinbase which is more user friendly if you're getting started.

Anyone having trouble buying from coinbase using their debit/credit card?
I keep getting an message that my transaction has been stopped because my banked canceled it. I've never had this issue before. I'm starting to think my bank is getting in on this lol

If you're feeling stressed why not set a price you feel comfortable to sell at once it starts to fall?
I'm not going to be able to answer all your questions but here are some.
- Nobody knows, this is the simplest answer to most of your questions.
- If the US bans Bitcoin it can crash and it can also go up. Remember that Bitcoin is being used globally, it's borderless, and people will always find ways around anything anyway.
You have to adapt, or HODL, and make sure you have an exit plan.

Coinbase/GDAX going in and out of service. It's like being on a wild rollercoaster ride with stops every so often, how annoying.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:55:52
You can't get a good answer out of anyone because no one knows exactly what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:25
GDAX is Coinbase, owned by the same company. GDAX is their exchange to be specific.
