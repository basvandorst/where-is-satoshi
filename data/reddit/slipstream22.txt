And let me add..., Justin Bieber!
Wait. I take it back. That was just plain nasty. Sorry, Canada. I got carried away.

I'm optimistic that Georgia will turn out to be a Bitcoin friendly state. At least not as foolishly hostile as NY.
Bitpay is located in Atlanta. The founders are Georgia Tech grads. They'll have some home field advantage when the state legislature gets around to evaluating cryptocurrency regs.
We'll see.

I was just kidding around, antinatree. Actually I think it's a pretty cool idea.
One angle to pitch it with to Coinstar is that it might attract people who don't otherwise have a way, (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Localbitcoins, etc) to acquire BTC. I see questions on here almost daily re "how do I buy"? Coinstar would be a viable alternative.

Thanks. I will check that out.

Why the fuck would 71 people, (at the current count), downvote this post?
Seriously. What's up with that? Are there that many trolls hanging out in these days?

I wanna be a "crypto prodigy". Maybe I'd get laid more.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:49:39
Thanks. I shoulda checked out the page before I asked. :)
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:05:12
So, upvote/downvote ratios are meaningless? Interesting.

Wouldn't using  to generate a custom public key mean the website would also have the associated private key? Thus compromising security completely?
Edit: Neeeever mind! I see that the page simply points to executables to download and run locally.

Yes, it can be done. But it will take 2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:42:03
Thanks. That makes sense.

Sometimes Reddit oozes such cynicism that I find myself drinking heavily before noon. And I'm genuinely grateful to Reddit for that.

I'm in the Nashville area. Same here. Flyte restaurant takes bitcoin and I'm going to make it a point to have some meals there. Hopefully merchant adoption rate will pick up.
I spend BTC pretty regularly online and would like to also be able to buy beer, groceries, clothes, etc in brick-n-mortar shops.

That's what really got me worried I think the term "The Mafia" is copyrighted by MPAA.

I'm going to reply and ask if I can settle the debt with 7 dogecoins instead.

Dood! This was sent by "scar1". Not scar2. Not scar3. Scar1 didn't get his godfather ranking by bullshitting. He's the real deal!

So true. I use PIA VPN. When I first signed up and went to pay I was surprised to see they accept bitcoin. Whoop out Mycelium..., scan QR code..., hear "boop"..., see success message..., no confirmation lag-time wait. Immediate done deal.
I chortled.

If they're both associated with the same private key, then what's the purpose or use of having two, ("Address" &amp; "Compressed Address"), formats?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:57:11
But..., but..., Coldsnack is demonstrating how snarky and intellectually superior he is. And how disdainful he is of anyone who might want to ask a question of other human beings instead of a search engine.
You must understand. He is an internet ninja.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:32:10
I've heard this before, but don't understand why it works that way. A simplified explanation would be greatly appreciated.
* I spend partial amounts from my Mycelium phone wallet and the balance adjusts down correctly. Then I add some spending coin back to it and it adjusts up correctly. Same with my Coinbase wallet, Blockchain wallet.
* Why would a paper wallet be different in this respect? Why can't I transfer half of the total and leave half in?

A question - tangentially on subject...
The first set of three I see at  are
    Private Key:
    5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAbuatmU
    Address:
    1MsHWS1BnwMc3tLE8G35UXsS58fKipzB7a
    Compressed Addressed:
    1Q1pE5vPGEEMqRcVRMbtBK842Y6Pzo6nK9
Why are the Address and Compressed Address both 34-bytes? What's "compressed" about the Compressed Address?

And, "What does your 'God' have to say about that?!"
