I've been to Greece several times and you often have the possibility to use credit cards in restaurants, stores, hotels etc. They just prefer cash. It makes it easier for them to evade taxes but if you're out of cash at the moment they'll let you use your credit card.

There were problems withdrawing btc for several months before the collapse, and how would everyone withdraw when the coins weren't even there? It would bring the collapse to an earlier point in time but the end result would be similar.

I don't think it was clear and that was obviously not the cause of the insolvency, though it might have helped speeding up the downfall.


IMHO those voices were negligible in the community back then. People were hating on Gox for their lag issues and so forth but I didn't see much speculation about their solvency until shit had already hit the fan. Roger Ver even vouched for them and tons of people voiced their belief in Gox right until the end.
For me personally as one of the "victims", it was this combined with my noobishness and fear of fucking up my cold storage, being totally unprepared to handle the amount of value (after the 2013 surge) and being admittedly naive that made me keep a large chunk of my coins there. 


That's assuming the coins weren't gone long before any of the problems became publicly apparent; which doesn't seem likely according to these findings: 


Can't argue with that. Hopefully it will be a lesson learned that sticks with the community this time.

I think it said something like 50% of fiat assets (not sure about exact number) and 2000 BTC in their hot wallet.

More sad than anything for the people who trusted those words.
