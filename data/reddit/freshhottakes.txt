That is not in the interview. Making stuff up again.

yikes, I can't imagine being this invested in a crazy talking point. I get not liking the things he funds as an adult. but come the heckarooni on over here. a jewish kid liked watching the nazis lose the war. it is not that hard to get.

I am talking about his actions as a child. Why do you think the actions of a child, who did not actually do anything, matter? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:21:14
He was 14 when the war ended. He, "was in constant danger" as he said in the video. So why do you lie about this?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:14:50


Why do you lie about this?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:58:32
He needs to be called out. But I think you're right. I've made my point. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:11:31
hahaahah, this is hilarious. Yes, Paul Krugman does not understand the economy. Unclear if Shiller understands the economy. Goodness. Why even make this?

Thankfully trump was lying about his economic policies wto trade. So we're all happy to be wrong about trump.

Yes, watching the nazis getting overthrowing them was one of the happiest parts of his life. What is wrong with that?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:40:37
You ignored the times other people were wrong, like gates, but said they understand economics because they support bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:41:07


You linked a random out of context clip. Calling him a nazi is just lying. Weak. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:38:50
And he was a child. So why do the actions of a child under constant danger really matter?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:16:42
He's was a child during ww2. How old do you think he is?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:08
No, taxes are really important. Prison ain't fun.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:04:56
Rick people? Regardless, telling someone not to pay taxes is horrible advice.

lol, it is great how afraid of SRS you are. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:20:29


Jokes on you, I am an SRSter. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:02:20


I don't really have a take. I don't think you can put SRS on the level of /b/ as far as influence goes. It is kind of you to call us Master level trolls, but I just don't think we've done that much. 
I never thought reddit was going down during this last round of drama. The problems caused by the admins were never anything that would have caused an exodus. 


The violentacrez thread was one of my favorites. Watching a creep porn king go down was a lot of fun.

This is the weirdest reddit reply I have ever gotten. 
I am not an SRS historian by any stretch of the imagination. We started out on Something Awful to make fun of reddit. I was not around for this. I am a post-digg redditor. It evolved from there to what it is today. Which his a poop museum that tries to keep in tact the horrible posts on reddit. Which means no brigading, but that's impossible for meta subs. So, whatevs. 
I am not a mod, nor am I cool so I don't know the internal politics. I think it has something to do with sleeping with admins for protection. I think it is mostly about how to take over other subs and protect SJW subs. 
We've evolved from being a place where you can make fun of all of the shit on reddit to a place where you need to find non low hanging fruit with ten or more upvotes in the positive to post. Which means other meta subs have the advantage of finding the really horrible stuff. 
We always take credit for the bad things that happen to reddit. It boosts our mythos. Generally we just enjoy being hated on reddit. I don't think SRSters are the reason violentacrez was written about or the reason Chris Hansen took an interest in reddit. But we like to dream. 
We have no influence on the world outside of reddit. At the end of the day we're a circle jack(since we jack sperm to use to force poor STEM-lords into hundreds of years of child support for children they never wanted) where SJWs can come and vent about how horribly racist and shitty reddit is. The non SRS-prime subs are good places to discuss what is going on and whether or not something posted onto prime actually is racist or sexist or what have you. 
Remember, don't break the jack!
