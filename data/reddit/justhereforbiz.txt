I still don't know what to think about crypto personally. But what does bother me is how desperate people seem for validation on their choice to invest. If you are so confident that it's the future... why post crap like this?

Someone gave me $10 worth of bitcoin 15 months ago. I probably check its value once a month just in sheer curiosity. I would never invest in something so unstable and with no credibility

Where did you hear that? Must have been asking someone....

Negative. I didn't feel like an idiot then, nor do I now. Ever heard of how you can't miss something you never had? Well that's also the same for not being able to miss something you never wanted. And thank God I didn't put anything into it. The bubble has burst. 
The fidget spinner trend lasted longer.

So you have 4 words in your vocabulary and you can't even get those right....

Glad to see it drop because I missed out? I literally had $10 'invested' which came from a friend when he was explaining what Bitcoin was in 2016. If I cared, don't you think I would have even put $1 of my own in?  
The only reason I want to see it fail is when I read things from the pretentious pricks who try to shove bitcoin down other peoples throats because you know you made a dumb move.

Sounds like someone went all in and is butthurt because its plummeting. Who would have thought a non existant, unsecure,  uninsured currency model would fail. Shocker ������

Well I would say real estate is a better wealth creation as it's real, can be insured, can be controlled etc. I haven't floated for a second. This whole sub wasn't about me. If you read it, it was about if people had exit plans due to the obvious downfall in prices and popularity.

Nope. It's a 'wheres all my money gone?' Face...

Wait. You mean taking real cash and swapping it for something imaginary isn't a good idea? Who would have thought it?
