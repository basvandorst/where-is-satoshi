I'm the author of dcpos.github.io/bip39/
Glad to hear your issue is resolved, and the feedback is useful. I'll make the error more specific so problems like this are easier to resolve. There's [a newly created issue]( to track development of this feature on github.

Thanks for your interest in the project.
Using this site should be secure if you download the site and run it locally, however I would recommend running it on an _offline_ computer. My preference for anything 'bitcoin offline' is to boot into a linux live operating system.
As pointed out, the site uses the `getRandomValues` api, which is suitable for cryptographic applications. You can see [on line 58 of the library]( and [line 162 of the app]( that if your browser does not have strong randomness, an error will be shown - `This browser does not support strong randomness`. If in doubt, I suggest reading about the particular implementation of getRandomValues for your combination of operating system and browser.
I'm very pleased to see you showing caution with randomness. It has certainly caught people out in the past.

~~blockr.io api~~
~~Example API url~~
~~Use from the response: `data.days_destroyed`~~
~~Documentation 
~~You will need to chain this with all the transaction data for the address, but point is it can be done.~~
~~I don't know of an api that does what you're looking for in one hit, but it may exist somewhere.~~
I don't know of an api that does days destroyed for addresses, only for txs.
You can fairly easily calculate it from the combined tx data for an address, but keep in mind the 'potential future' days destroyed is a moving target since time is always changing.

You should have a look at [DC POS]( Here's how it solves your three questions
1. The 'best processor' depends on your particular needs. DC POS supports both bitpay and coinbase, so if you ever find the other offers better features for your situation, you can easily change without having to learn how to use a new payment system. We support several other wallets too, and are always adding more.
2. DC POS keeps a record of your transactions for both the amount you sold (in dollars) and the amount you received in bitcoin. This means it's easy to work out your tax by viewing or exporting your transaction history. If you have a particular tax-oriented need, we'd be glad to facilitate it (just [let us know](
3. You can use DC POS on any device with a browser - your phone, a tablet; we even integrate with some web-based POS systems so you can accept bitcoin without ever needing to leave the app.
Hopefully this info helps you out.

It supports mnemonics of any length (divisible by 3).
Currently it doesn't do passphrases but it's easy to add, so I'll do that. Also good suggestion about phrase/mnemonic wording. I'll go through the wording and double-check it with the formal spec to make sure it's consistent.

I submitted a bug report with Coinpunk.
I only managed to scan 1 qr code using 4 different online qr code generators. I'll look into switching the qr generator in DC POS if I can find a new generator which works for all mobile wallets.
Thanks for the feedback FluffyGlass; reporting issues like this is the kind of simple thing that anyone can do to help make the bitcoin ecosystem more robust.

The 12 word seed is from [bip39](
The list of words, whilst not 'official', is fairly standard across current popular wallets (including mycelium), and is specified in [english.txt]( - there are also wordlists for japanese and spanish. It's important to note that the word list is not required to be the same as this list, but usually it is.
The 12 word mnemonic is then converted to a [bip32 seed]( which allow the generation of addresses and private keys.
If you're looking for a tool for testing out all this stuff, I'd recommend [the DC POS bip39 tool]( which handles bip39 (the 12 words to generate a seed) and bip32 (the deterministic hierarchical seed that generates public/private keys)
Also have a look at [this alternative tool]( that does a similar job.
@_date: 2014-10-15 11:02:48
FYI the official English wordlist for BIP39 is here
edit: 'official' although bear in mind BIP39 still has status of draft

This has been fixed now. Turns out Firefox doesn't allow selecting values in disabled form fields, but it does for readonly. Thanks again for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:07:32
Thanks for the feedback, I'll change it so those values can be copied. They should be able to be copied even with the disabled text-box, but it clearly doesn't work as expected so I'll change it.

Lead dev of the POS terminal app here...
I can confirm the bug was with the blockchain.info wallet app for iPhone. It only sends transactions with the amount accurate to 6dp even though it scans the full 8dp accuracy from the QR correctly. Very frustrating.
I have opened a bug report with blockchain.info here:

Not sure how to extrapolate the trend, since the charts show distributions. It's possible to extrapolate the *values* easily enough (as the Constraints table does), but the *distribution* can't be predicted. If you have ideas how to make that work I'd be keen to know, since a visualization of the future would be more intuitive than numbers in a table.
Thanks for the feedback, I'll make the bars easier to see in the next version.
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:46:04
Great feedback, I'll include this in the next version. It's a complex tool and this feedback is essential to making it accurate and useful.
You're right about costs not necessarily being proportional, but I think proportional costs is a reasonable way to assess it, considering bandwidth usually isn't used exclusively for bitcoin (especially in a home setting). It's meant to be a way to judge 'the cost of bitcoin' not 'the bill you get'.
Hop timing does not account for validation, good catch.
Lifetime cost assumes a 5 year life.
Bandwidth constraint is calculated to allow 4 hops of 20 MB to 7 peers within the 600s window = 4 hops * 20 MB * 8 bPerB * 7 nodes / 600 seconds = 7.5 Mbps
If this bandwidth speed can be achieved, the node will be able to keep up. Yes, their stale rate may be high, but that's up to them to decide how high is too high. Right?

Perhaps there is some room for movement on the wallet side here as well.
An invalid ssl certificate is surely bad, but an expired certificate is *far less risky* than most other errors such as an invalid signature. It may be better for user experience if the wallet shows the expired certificate error *but still allow the user the option to pay anyway*.
[BIP70]( even says "Display the merchant's identity and **ask the customer if they would like to submit payment**" (emphasis mine).
Consider the risk here
* disabling invalid payment: the merchant loses a sale :( and the customer does not get the goods :(
* allowing invalid payment: the merchant is possibly defrauded :( and customer gets their goods :)
Both consumer and merchant would surely prefer the 'risky but still allowed to pay' option.

I'm really interested in making it right, can you expand on why it's wrong? Saying 'its wrong' doesn't help make it right.
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:26:26


Doesn't this mean the slowest node(s) governs the max block size? Seems a bit unfair. There must be some point where a slow node becomes nonviable.


That 30s value... quite magical. Is there some literature to support this? I looked into Patrick Strateman at Scaling Bitcoin but came up empty-handed. A link would be great.
30s per hop = 19 hops per block. With an average of 8 connected peers per node, a lot of clients that can be kept up to date - 8^nHops, ie 2*10^16
1 hop = 8 nodes uptodate;
2 hops = 64 nodes uptodate;
3 hops = 512 nodes uptodate;
n hops = 8^n nodes uptodate
Am I on the right track with this analysis?
edit: formatting
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:23:08
You say 'if you want to have 5% stale blocks at 20MB per block you need 43Mbps'. Instead, the tool flips it saying 'given you have 43 Mbps you'll have 5% stale blocks at 20MB per block'. This is a more sensible way to frame it since speed is a variable, and stale rate is a parameter (and up to the node operator to decide if their particular stale rate is viable for them).
Can you please review the way I've calculated stale blocks and tell me if it's wrong? Maybe I've just made it more complex than it needs to be?
Appreciate your input on this.
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:54:06
Thanks for the plug on the tool, appreciate it!
I would say a standard for utilizing BIP39 *has* been developed, ie BIP39 itself.
What is incorrect here is breadwallet incorrectly implementing BIP39 by rejecting a 24 word seed. A 24 word seed is standard, and BW not accepting it is non-standard.
From [BIP39]( (still in draft status by the way) - "We refer to the initial entropy length as ENT. The recommended size of ENT is 128-256 bits." This corresponds to a mnemonic sentence between 12 and 24 words.
Further confusing the 'standardness' of wallet mnemonics and seeds is the derivation path used. BIP44 is meant to solve this, but uptake is not as consistent as desired.

Eventually the tool will have consideration for new tech like IBLT which should reduce bandwidth required for block propagation.
The tool started simple (and not that useful or accurate) and is slowly getting more complex and useful, but also harder to interpret. It's a tough balancing act.
@_date: 2016-06-13 10:38:31
Good idea about reposting. I'll do that as a link to the tool later in the week (rather than a text post like this one). I was going for a more holistic post to start with, hoping to get some broad feedback.
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:33:04
It's interesting isn't it?! I found some things I wouldn't have intuitively expected.
The tool is still a work in progress. Next on the list is Initial Block Download info. I'll put --blocks-only mode as part of that change. Currently the bandwidth calculations are only for block relay, and don't account for transaction relay. It's a complex problem to model, and will see a lot of iterative improvement thanks to feedback like yours.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:14:42
Thanks for the feedback, appreciate the explanations. I'll incorporate these aspects into the next version of the tool.
I'm still feeling the definition of "needs to participate reasonably well" is not that clear (at least to me). There must be some acceptable level of orphan blocks. 5% seems a bit arbitrary.
My plan is to work out the proportion of orphan blocks depending on the bandwidth available (as entered by the user) vs bandwidth required (as determined by the block parameters). Whether this rate is 'acceptable' is up to the user to decide, not the tool.
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:14:32
The bandwidth only accounts for download which, as you say, is wrong. I'll add a 'connected peers' parameter to the simulation to correct this.
Why do you say 30s in your calculation? Why not use 600s? I'm using the average block time not the worst-case block time since catchup is possible during 'bad luck' periods.
Also agreed, IBD (intial block download) requirements are ignored, do you have a good model for how to incorporate this? There is no 'ideal' IBD requirement.
The model is simple; I'm looking to increase the complexity but want to keep the interpretation simple.  Any ideas?
@_date: 2016-12-12 05:35:38
since [the demo page for that library]( is a dead link, try using this one which uses the same library behind the scenes
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:27:15
A good place to start:
Happy to answer any specific questions.

In general yes, keeping a mnemonic on a piece of paper will work.
The risk is if you don't combine a passphrase with the mnemonic, anyone who finds the mnemonic can access the bitcoins.
A secure backup should depend on
* something you are (able to access the physical secret mnemonic location)
* something you have (your mnemonic)
* something you know (your passphrase)
@_date: 2016-05-01 05:20:19
Agreed, there's no simple singular days destroyed api.
To reiterate, I think the important point is that *it requires calculation*. The convenient 'days-destroyed' value in the api above is 'total' days destroyed for the transaction (ie for all addresses in the tx, not for a single address).
@_date: 2016-07-11 23:03:38
50MB blocks would require a full node to transfer 1.79 TB per month.
That's quite a heavy load for most home connections.
