Just update to 0.13.2. Will speed things up significantly.

They are that way because they are not used anywhere near the amount of bitcoin.  Cant have full blocks and network congestion if nobody uses your network.  They will all face scaling issues, this isnt specific to bitcoin. The farce happens when the pumpers claim that these altcoins retain all the benefits of bitcoin but none of the issues.

Ill tell you at our Bitcoin businesses transactions havent slowed down one bit.  I dont buy that.  In addition if all these people are trading btc to alts, that would be on chain for btc deposit into exchange or shapeshift.

Sorry I wasn't more specific.  Back when I came (long before these debates) those are the qualities that brought me to bitcoin.  If bitcoin mining is and has become centralized its more important now than ever to not give the miners more power than they already have.  BU will allow them to set the blocksize potentially opening attack vectors to make mining even more centralized.

This may be true but its a win win for gbtc.  
Denied: Premium goes up
Approved: Bitcoin price shoots up

Perhaps it was to show the enthusiasm and excitement of programmers who have never interacted with bitcoin.  The point is to grow the community by introducing new people to Bitcoin as a protocol and tool that developers can use to build new things.  Unfortunate that it did not meet your standards :(...... /s

So Jeff Garzik is leaving Bitcoin? Bloq is closing up shop on their Bitcoin product offerings? Fail to see your point.  Engineers like to expand their minds nothing wrong with that.  Make no mistake Bitcoin &amp; Etheruem couldn't be more different, one is a toy and the other a reliable engine which many revenue producing companies depend on.  Etheruem doesn't magically inherit Bitcoins hashrate, immutability, security and track record.

Guess the hypocrisy of Roger Ver escapes you even after the cartoon. People that talk out of the side of their mouth while looking you in the face saying something completely different deserve to be called out.

Whats with this self entitled bullshit title.  Software is hard, you must not build it.  Shit breaks.  As long as you have access to their service and your money cut them some slack for a graph. Even the greats (goog, fb, microsoft) have issues from time to time.

It's not about being interested in another crypto. There is nothing wrong with that. But promoting other crypto as superior to bitcoin while bashing bitcoin/profiting while saying you want what's best for bitcoin is disingenuous at the least. Furthermore claiming those cryptos are or will be superior while knowing they will have the same issues or greater ones than bitcoin (if anyone actually uses them) is deceiving.

We/they(developers) do watch the whole space.  Anything that emerges as a breakthrough in the space, Bitcoin can and will adapt to if possible.

I came here for
* decentralization
* fixed supply/monetary policy
* talented devs
* censorship resistance
* store of value
* OS code base
Please tell me which crypto beats bitcoin at those things? 
Also define your "objective" conditions.

Hashrate historically has pretty much always gone up.  The whole week the tx backlog has been close to non existent.

not an exchange but bitcoin atms will make a huge impact and onboard many many users.

Try Bitcoin Tools  it converts bitcoin price tickers to different currencies based on fixer.io exchange rates. Has BTCC and it may be what your looking for.

basically at that moment in time if someone would have wanted 250k worth of btc and didnt care about the ask price as long as it was under 1k it would have take the price on Gemini to 1000 per btc.
