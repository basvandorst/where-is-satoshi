The BU people are like a crowd of over-excited teenagers that are collectively trying to design an engine. Each one of them shouts things like "stick a valve in there, it will pump like hell!". "No wait, put one more cylinder there, it will kick ass!".

These 3 companies can work perfectly well if their customers are investors and developers. I'm sure they are impatient for mass adoption, and serve millions of customers rather than thousands. You want mass adoption, I want mass adoption, pretty much everybody wants mass adoption. Shall we do something incredibly risky and split into 2 blockchains because "I can't wait, I want it all now. I want moon and leave my 9to5 next month"? No, we shouldn't. We are changing the world, we are challenging the Federal Reserve. This is a very serious thing now. Not a game anymore. Let the technical people do their job. Listen to them, don't listen to angry mobs screaming and shouting with pitch and forks.  
I admire the core devs for not having just pushed a number from 1 to 2 out of safety concerns. It might be counter-intuitive, but technical matters often are. Don't just dive into whatever feels "easy".

A nice low-power option if you don't want having to keep your pc on 24 hours:
  
No linux skills required: just plug it into your router and turn it on.
Disclosure: I have never personally tried it. I have no vested interest in the producer.

Did you stop reading after the first sentence? Just keep reading the next 2 sentences.  
To reiterate: Bitcoin right now works well for investors and developers. It is just not ready for mass adoption yet. To scale for mass adoption, it needs 2nd layer solutions. Even BU tech people agree on that.  
So at the moment we are in a phase where developers can design/improve the system, and investors can invest, by buying bitcoins or by starting up companies.  
When the system will be ready to seriously scale (in maybe 2-3 years), then mass adoption... and moon.  
Now, if BU will not help to scale for mass adoption, what good will it be ? Well in this early phase we are now it will somehow help the investors in the sense that when they want to invest $1000 in BTC, they will pay $0.1 instead of $1. Thing is, I don't think they will care much about this difference in fee, what they will really care about is about whether bitcoin is split in 2 blockchain, or if it is all in one piece.  
So don't be greedy. We'll get there man, and we'll get there and all in one piece. We'll walk over the rubble of the Federal Reserve building. Be patient.

Bitcoin as it is now works perfectly well for investors and developers.  
We are now working to make bitcoin ready to scale for mass adoption.   It will probably take 2-3 years to get there in a safe way.  
Keep in mind that mass adoption means *moon*. I rather wait 2-3 years and do it in a safe way rather than rush and do something stupid due to greed and impatience.

To let the rpi enable all the available power to the usb add the following line to /boot/config.txt (then of course reboot):  
max_usb_current=1  
That solved the problem for me! Now it should be able to power any 2.5" HD without external power. (but not 3.5" ones)  
Another important line to add to /boot/config.txt is:  
gpu_mem=16  
This will set the video ram to the minimum of 16 MB and will make a lot more memory available to the system. You will still be able to use a display, just the 3D rendering will not work.  
Other settings in bitcoin.conf that I use:  
disablewallet=1     # saves memory, and faster startup (if you don't need the wallet)  
maxmempool=50   # default is 300MB, which I think is way too much (but somebody that knows best should confirm)   
rpcthreads=1    # default is 4. should save about 12MB or ram, without any drawbacks (I think)

This is an option (dbcache) that makes a big difference on performance, and you should always be generous with it. On a standard PC you should give it a few gigabytes, but on the rpi I leave it to its default of 300MB which is already a third of its ram. You might watch the memory usage while bitcoind is running and see if you could maybe push it to 500MB or so, but I never really bothered with it as my rpi node has also other stuff running like torrent.

The rpi usb is able to power a 2.5 inch hard drive.  
You just have to add max_usb_current=1 to /boot/config.txt, reboot and you hard drive should be working fine.  
You should also be sure that you have a proper 2A or more PSU. I recommend the official rpi PSU.

Some very important options to save the precious ram of your rpi:
* set gpu_mem=16 in /boot/config.txt  
  The default is 128 MB so this is 112 MB you get for free. 16 MB is the minimum
  amount of video memory, and you will no longer be able to play 3D games but
  for a bitcoin node there will be no drawback whatsoever.
  Don't forget to reboot after you edited config.txt. Use free -m before and
  after the change to see the difference.
* set maxmempool=50 in bitcoin.conf  
  The default is 300 MB which is huge, and unnecessary. This is the memory pool
  of bitcoin transactions that are waiting to be mined in a block. Since a block
  is 1MB, 50MB should be plenty. Don't push it too low though, or the new compact block
  relaying will be less efficient.
  Don't forget to stop and restart bitcoind after editing bitcoin.conf for the
  change to take effect.
* Be sure the swap is increased from the default of 100MB. 500MB-1GB should do.
  Use free -m to check the available swap.
The ram you will have saved will be used to cache the data of your hard-disk/flash and will make the node much more responsive and performant.

I think you are missing the point. It's still early days, many people still don't know bitcoin, and these machines are meant to promote bitcoin. People wanting to do a serious investments at the best rate will use an exchange like bistamp. After having done all the ID/proof of address bullshit, that is.
These ATMs are an excellent way to introduce new people passing by to bitcoin. They can buy a small amount, experiment with it, learn how it works, without having to bother with KYC/AML stuff, or at least with some simplified/instant version of KYC/AML.
I would certainly have been happy to have paid 12% and got introduced to bitcoin 6 months before I did. It would have paid off a big time...

Litecoin hasn't started signalling yet. Signalling will start at the first difficulty retarget after the starting time, which should be at block 1143071, in about 1.6 days.

Deflation is great! It encourages people to be more considerate with their purchases, and not buy things unless they really need them.  
Our rivers, forest and eco-system will be grateful.  
Less consumerism, coupled with the big rise in automation will also greatly reduce employment, which is by far the best thing!  
We will soon live in a world where cars and trucks drive themselves, factories are fully automated, houses are 3d-printed, and people will finally be free from forced employment. Our economic system will be completely different.  
We are at the dawn of a new era, a new Renaissance. Art, science, and creativity will flourish to unprecedented levels.  
It will all happen so fast you won't believe it.

I'm beginning to think that BIP148 should really come with a POW change.  
It's the only think that would make sense at this point, given how things are going.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:15:10
It would fall in the 2-4MB category. There's not much of a difference for the purpose of evaluating the block-size/security tradeoff. The poll was not about "what scaling solution do you want?".
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:02:43
BIP148 has already been implemented and deployed, so I'm talking more in general about a new UASF  
A UASF that activates Segwit, and then switches to a new POW only in case at least N1 blocks are not mined within N2 hours.

Apologies for wrongly attributing it to you Luke. I edited the post. The original proposal and also the BIP authoring were  from Shaolin Fry.  
Fair enough. My thinking was along the lines of people throwing their support to Kickstarter projects. The threshold in that case helps gives confidence to the supporters about what happens exactly in either cases.  
But I admit the situation here is way more complicated. =)  
By the way, if we are going ahead regardless, I guess we should review the question "Can BIP148 be cancelled?" at uasf.co ?
