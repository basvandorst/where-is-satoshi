It was unappealing to my girlfriend, who does not particularly care for Bitcoin... To both of us it seemed like a Bitcoin circlejerk documentary...
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:10:22
This post is dumb
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:40:57
And they won't ever stop talking about Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:51:00
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:33:46
Doing that is fine but it is really stupid to publicly state that
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:48:32
It's like if an alcoholic switched to weed

I'll bet you .25BTC that you can't turn your $50 into $500,000 by this time next year... I'm serious

Do you have to be in a legal state to invest?
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:46:41
Can you tell me more about this?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:08:58
Yeah that's why it is important to not keep your money on a website
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:37:30
I would love a job where I could get paid in BTC
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:11:13
Do you have any questions?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:32:50
So when should we buy in?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:29:53
So will this make the price increase or decrease? Should I but now or wait a week?
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:32:20
Disaster like alcohol and marijuana prohibition

You pull up the app on your phone have your QR code scanned and insert bills... The prices are in real time but with about a 12% upcharge (at least the one in the picture)

Either way John McAfee will be happy

@_date: 2017-11-19 05:42:13
What is this? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:55:28
It's me because the search bar is so bad here I just use Google

What does this mean to somebody planning on investing more into cryptocurrencies soon? Should I wait or what?

What is a good way to buy Bitcoin without linking a credit card or bank information? I constantly am stuck with a lot of extra fees and I end up paying about $0.88 on the dollar with a Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:56:52
I've used Paxful but you only get around $0.84 on the $1... Is there a way to use a visa gift card to buy Bitcoins at a better rate? I don't want to use my banking info so I am limited to ATMs and gift cards
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:22:34
Where is this?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:32:32
I just bought all I've could afford ($100), maybe that will help push it over $10k
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:28:24
Not when you're broke :(
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:24:08
Are they still doing that offer?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:46:16
Is there any website you can use without paying huge fees and without connecting your bank or credit card?

How are you an assassin?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:39:39
I just started last week... I've invested $125 and am planning on changing any of my extra fiat into BTC and using it as sort of a savings account... I know there's still time :)

What is wrong with cloud mining? I HODL but I am just curious

@_date: 2017-11-18 15:39:06
That looks disgusting
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:54:44
What if the website disappears one day and you had all of your money on it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:21:08
No :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:12:57
How much you living off of? Sounds nice...
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:20:13
I wish I invested in Bitcoin early enough to be able to do that :(

You might be right... I just was looking for a subreddit that is educational about Crypto and specifically Bitcoin because that is what I currently own
