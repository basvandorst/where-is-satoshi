Ahhh interesting. Thank you! So should I be transferring my bitcoin to my desktop wallet the second I purchase? Should I leave any funds at all in Coinbase? If so, why?

So Im new (sorry). I just went to test the "sell bitcoin" feature on Coinbase, and it says that the function is not available in my country. Not that I'm planning on selling anytime soon, but what do I do when the time comes?

Ahhh I feel like an idiot asking this, but I can't seem to find an answer that makes sense...
What is the point of a wallet? I currently have a few hundred bucks worth of bitcoin on Coinbase, so what use is a wallet? If I store it in a *desktop wallet*, will it still grow over time? Please eli5. Thank you in advance for any replies.

Ditto. That's  for me. Then a house for myself, university for my niece, then a white lambo.

This is a perfect analogy. Thanks. I find it slightly odd that I have to download different software to properly and safely store it. Any idea why Coinbase just wouldn't offer this in the first place?

So should I even bother with Coinbase at all? Should I just move everything over now?

I never have a fucking clue
