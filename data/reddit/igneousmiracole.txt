Why would I wait to celebrate a successful trade? That's the difference between successful traders and gamblers, where gamblers think "i should've gotten in at $x or waited for $y," successful traders care about only two prices, their basis and their standing order's sell price.

He was going to sell once it crashed. Then wait for it to crash some more. Then buy once it crashed even more, right before it went on a bull run! It's a classic tactic invented by M.C. Hammer.

Look at the trading volumes of the CNY exchanges compared to the USD and EUR exchanges. Lots of stop-limit activity in China, but very little trading since.

Yay for price manipulation by BTC exchanges! Soon all of this decentralized crypto BS will be replaced by those good old traditional currency policies and practices.

They have instant buy and instant sell. That means if I hit buy/sell, they honor it at that price whether or not there's a companion buyer/seller. This is their money at risk when the graphs get steep.

All this "when 1 bit = $X everyone will want in" BS is just that, BS. Where 1 bit = $X, people with $X will be able to buy 1 bit. End of equation. They won't be buying for $.20 per BTC and then having it appreciate to $1/bit, as long as fiat currencies exist, the BTC will always be valued by their exchange to fiat and will always be worth what they're worth. 
Only in the poor house do you hear that old "if you bought $10 worth of [Uber/Google/GE/Union Pacific/J.B. Joyce Clocks/Goto Saki/Ezekiel's Buckets/Quetzalcoatl's adobe/Ug's Rocks/Littlefoot's Treestars] on the ground floor, now it'd be worth..." And in that same poor house you hear "so this time I'm not going to lose out; I'm going to put ALL my money in [ETH/BTC/Pokemon Cards/Beanie Babies/Junk bonds/South American currencies/Swiss Bank stocks/chia pets] because I've heard they're the next big thing." Sure, on any gamble you may win big, but nowadays (read always), if you're hearing about it in public fora, you've long missed the ground floor, and this elevator doesn't have any windows.

Must be nice to have a crystal ball. For those of us in the real world, volatility = volatility.

No. This is how the SEC operates. They always wait until the last minute. Anyone who has followed other big SEC decisions was aware this decision would come out on the last day, after markets closed. I was expecting Monday (since they technically had until Monday night), but the final Friday decision comes as no surprise to anyone who isn't getting all their information from r/bitcoin &amp; r/BTC.

"already over"? It's been 58 minutes and many of the major exchanges were down for some or all of that. Volatile times are around the bend.

I moved a substantial portion of my assets to BTC over the past few days. More than I ever intended to hodl, just pure speculation.

You're confusing centralization/fiat with broadening access to something. An ETF won't mean that you lose control over anything, it means that more people will be allowed to benefit from this thing of ours.

If you're planning on making a move based on information being posted in this subreddit, you're planning on catching a falling knife. With confirmation times where they are, any meaningful trading will happen before anyone posts anything here.

The pseudoscience is what people interpret from the data. It's called "technical analysis" and it's very similar to the thing voodoo practitioners do where they spill the bones on the table and read them.

This mentality is how people lose lots and lots of money in markets. You know your purchase price; that can't be changed. Decide on your selling price and place standing orders. If something changes, change your orders. Trying to swap around a bull or bear trap is extremely stupid.

It was a volume of coins I had for strictly speculation purposes expecting the ETF to be approved, and I was only interested in the position on the possibility of ETF approval. And I got out at ~$1260 and ~$1240.

The issue isn't the money coming from the bank, it's Coinbase not putting through the trades at all. Buying and selling are affected alike.

If you don't have a source that will know before news outlets do, it's ill advised to think you'll be able to make any effective trades prior to a bull or bear trap being snared. If you're just curious, your best indicator will likely be an alert on the value of a coin (as it shoots up or down). After that, you could open this subreddit and sort by "new," and find out when the rest of the uninitiated do ;)

tl;dr you're trading one well-known, well-studied, readily-anticipable and easily-combatted risk for a host of mystery risks under the guise of beating the system.

Coinbase is operated by very intelligent people. And they're not in the business of losing money! I wasn't about to rely on them for these trap trades and I'm glad I trusted my intuition!

For BTC, volatility does make it a bad "investment." With the way things are going with confirmation times and exchanges being pwnd, you can't play the volatility while protecting your downside and mitigating your risks the way you can with more established and traditional investment vehicles. I do believe there's a place for BTC in a portfolio (I'm here aren't I?), but these guys with a substantial chunk of their nut in BTC are playing russian roulette with a glock. BTC is a gamble, albeit one that proved very rewarding for the earliest adopters.

SCOTUS might disagree, but it's an ever-evolving area of law. My most used citations are DirecTV v. Imburgia 577 U.S. ___ (2015) and Am. Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., __ U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 2304 (2013) (class action waivers are enforceable and do not deny a plaintiff any substantive right simply because individual claims of nominal value would more effectively proceed on a class basis).

The chain is a ledger and nothing else. The chain has no value except as evidence of the historical functionality of the currency. Your bitcoins, Bcash, and holographic charizard cards are worth whatever a buyer is willing to pay minus the cost for you to sell. Nothing more; nothing less. Alt-coins are no different. Exchange arbitrage doesn't increase anything's value, it just accelerates equilibrium among exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:45:42
Which is just a misunderstanding of how assets are valued. The art student sitting in front of the masterpiece painting a copy doesn't affect the value of the masterpiece. The copy may have some value to someone, and that student may turn out to be a master herself, thus making the copy more valuable than the masterpiece, but the collectors of the old master's work aren't necessarily affected by a new student or a new master.

In most areas (except employment law), it does. SCOTUS has been broadly validating class action waivers since 2014 and shows no sign of stopping.

My post was speicifcally about when the block reward is gone, i.e. when all coins have been mined. The issue with the "we'll all have supercomputers and free energy" trope is that the cost per unit of electricity, globally, is going up and the computing difficulty of mining continually scales up and continually has a more crowded hashrate as well. Mining has to be difficult or the blockchain is meaningless. If anyone can easily or quickly mine, then anyone can manipulate the chain. I think most people do not understand blockchain technology enough to understand that this is a real issue.

OMG! If I'm reading the above chart correctly, it looks like we still have absolutely no idea where the price will go in the future, and all this technical analysis BS is still no more reliable than consulting a local psychic! To-the-MOON!! OR Regulation-OR-Whale-Dump-Related-CRASH!!

I mean "buy in" as a miner. Spend the thousands it takes to do any useful amount of mining.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:43:33
They would only mine if it's potentially profitable and there will be a lot less speculation with difficulty and hashrate expansion so profitability will be far more predictable, relatively .

Deep into Early Majority, if not Late Majority. There are a great many alt-coins that have addressed the issues inherent to BTC being the trailblazer technology, and it's highly unlikely BTC will be the crypto to come out on top. So much BTC is held by such a small population of people that there cannot possible be a massive influx of users or value coming in as the market is and will remain divided unevenly between whales and paupers. If there is going to be any broad-scale adoption, the small group of majority holders would need to agree to freeze and control their segment of the market (think diamond markets), and this has proven to be a greedy, greedy bunch (we are humans, after all). If and when crypto/BC technology becomes commonplace and mainstream currency, you'd be a fool to think governments and HNV individuals will allow a coin like BTC to get any real traction when the end-game value is already controlled and held by a small group of people.

$1M per day doesn't come anywhere close to the electricity cost of mining even at the current global hashrate and difficulty. Also, if that's split among 100,000 miners, that's just $10 per day on average. Given the difficulty and expense of running competitive mining operations under today's difficulty, it just doesn't add up...
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:30:00
The 100+ year estimate ignores the fact that quantum computing is right around the corner for governments and China is investing hundreds of millions in Bitcoin tech. Mining is already not profitable. The only people making money on mining are those organizing pools, selling mining equipment/throughput, or stealing electricity. Everyone else just can't do math or is willing to lose money for fun.

But the value of bitcoin will eventually (if it's not already) be tied to its ease and reliability of use. This is one of those issues where you'll have more value only with more participants and more participants means a lower share per participant. Why would anyone buy in?

Store them underwater, naturally. No, the solution is storing with someone you can trust and hold financially accountable like an attorney with a major law firm. If you're the paranoid type, you can also use etched stone (if you're really storing a huge value of coins) and duplicative partial backups split up among people or places you can trust (1/3 of the key in 3 safety deposit boxes, with 3 friends, and in 3 places around your house).

Search for videos of how "fireproof" those safes actually are. The safe will survive, sure, but the contents will be well done in any real house fire. If the fire is minor, they may provide additional security for the contents, but in a total loss, you've got a total loss.
