The scam was declaring his new shtcoin was going to "send Bitcoin into a death spiral" and that BCH was the real Bitcoin, the only one that would survive. The scam was slandering all the hardworking people who worked on bitcoin core as compromised.  The scam was saying his shtcoin was the only way to scale and then attacking bitcoin with spam transactions to try and fill the mempool, increase transaction costs and destroy bitcoin.  The scam was using a bitcoin url domain to promote BCASH.

Since, I haven't seen anyone say this in a page or two of comments.  Note the x-axis of the chart is constant, while the excerpted portion is reduced to approximately 1/3rd size to fit the chosen past pattern, nor is it a perfect fit, still interesting.  Not saying this is just a fishing expedition where if you screw with the time frame you have an infinite number of possible patterns to attempt to find correlation with.  Contrariwise, another obvious interpretation would be that free will is an illusion and things must repeat themselves but at 1/3rd speed in future.

Yep, I picked a little more up at 9800.  The weekly stochastic is pinned over 80, monthly stochastic heading towards 80 so there may be one more green monthly bar and perhaps (to likely) even a run towards 14 -15k.  My guess, (just purely a guess) is over the summer there is consolidation with maybe resistance around a nice even number like 10,000 as BTC gathers itself for a challenge of the ATH in late summer, fall time-frame.  The thing is so volatile though, could it really be all that surpising if it goes back to 7,000 and has only more than doubled for the year.

Funny, I got the same sort of response, though less insulting, when I was trying to tell someone the bear market was ended at 3800 a few months back and to get in which I did.  "Oh dear deary me, I feel sorry for you" was the reply at the time, while everyone was stunned there was a green candle for even one month because it was going to 1,000.  BTCs price has now appreciated 3 fold (4k -&gt; 12k) in three months.  For your homework what would be the BTC price in 30 months, only 2 and one half years, if this rate of apprecation continues unabated? hint its not $120,000. Actually it would be $236,196,000.  236 million dollars a coin, (for a market cap with 15 million coins of 3.54 quadrillion dollars) might even save McAffee's dick. Maybe I know nothing about all this but I knew enough to build a mining rig back when it was profitable to GPU mine LTC, yourself? So by all means please don't listen to a thing I say.

Still traded a bit there as 0% fees are pretty forgiving, and supposedly at least the funds are FDIC insured, or does that only apply to CB not CB Pro?  Binanace and Coinbene both have .15% maker and taker fees if you buy their exchange coin, their layouts are more usable and professional looking and they have more liquidity.  Getting rid of stop loss orders wth is up with that, as Austin Powers said, I too like to live dangerously.

I hated BCash from the start and never touched it with a ten foot pole.  When you have a felon convicted for selling explosives on the internet who flies into an obscenity filled rage at the word BCash as the frontman that is bad news that you can't cover over no matter how many troll farms you hire.  What I don't know if I will ever forgive them for, is the whole "BCash is the real BTC ... we are sending BTC into a death spiral".  I'm a relative small fry but the BTC cap at that time was what 200 billion, yes it corrected because it was overbought, but as with Mt. Gox. the reason the correction was twice as bad as it might have been was for one reason, BCash.  BCash, Bcash, Bcash.  They wiped out tens of billions to over a hundred billion dollars of decent peoples wealth that would have been used helping their parents, families, friends, communities, taking a vacation, pursuing learning or a hobby, all because the motley crew of criminals, frauds and delusionals wanted to be masters of the universe and control the whole financial cryptosphere.  Well now that Bitmain is a dumpster fire, Craig, (what did he say to an African nation at his lecture "I have more money than your whole nation") "I AM SATOSHI NAKAMOTA" Wright is commonly known to be a delusional nutjob, BTC and the rest of the good projects have a chance of recovering and further contributing to the common good.  It is hard not to see the irony in BCash being destroyed by infighting and forks.  But yes, aside from the overbought technical conditions it was all BCash that led to the astonishingly violent selloff of BTC.  I look forward to Doggycoin overtaking BCash and its fork.  Dogecoin, as an aside, should be required as the madatory token of settlement in all international financial transacations exceeding 100 million dollars, just because.  Would sure be better than JPMorgan coin, aka the new BCash.
To the OP, sorry about your loss, yes there are troll farms that magnify a clique or position even if its BS.  If it makes you feel better everyone got hurt by what those involved with BCash did.  In general though if you bet on people that are, or at a minimum appear to be, honest, bright and hardworking you are more likely to do well over time.

@_date: 2019-03-28 00:28:32
Depends.   Say you bought $1,000 worth of BTC and the BTC price increases 5x in next three years, not too outlandish a thought, maybe see something near the previous all time high within three years, in four years you have 5k.  Say you bought $1,000 worth of mining equipment where at the current price you could earn your money back in two years, again not too unreasonable with cheap electricity. After two years the miner is still "printing" money and you are outpacing the buy/hodler. Also, if the price starts increasing one might earn their money back in 18 months or 12, anything after the miner is paid for is just money flowing in.  Of course more powerful miners might come out and decrease profit, but once the miner has paid for itself it is all profit, something you don't get with just buying. On the other hand, as so many miners have found out the past year suppose the price goes down, you are a) taking longer to reach pay back, say ten years or never, instead of 2, b) the miners are depreciating and breaking down and c) you may actually be losing money as the mined BTC doesn't cover electricity costs.  In that scenario maybe you lose 500 buying at the wrong time and miner loses 1,500.  I guess it is sort of like a form of leverage except if you stop mining the coins are still yours, unlike a margin call. Not to ramble too much, but I had 4 GPUs mining litecoin back in the day, set it up just to see if I could get it running, shut it down with the Mt. Gox crash, thinking hey that was fun but these things make too much noise.  That was unfortunate, turned around a couple years later and was like, you're kidding me, it's worth what?  If I had just left those miners alone and/or switched them to ETH, it wouldn't have been life changing money, but it would have been quite a very nice payday from four stinking GPUs.  So, I would guess the OP is right, unless you think BTC is going to 1 or 2 thousand after having dropped 85% in a year. it is a good time to get into mining, I've got a little mining garden of mine own going again and I guess I am trying to psyche myself up to expand it.  Still like GPUs as the resale value further limits the downside.

If I had to guess Bitcoin will as with historical (err past few years) oscillations do very well over the next couple years, followed by the obligatory 80%+ drop then looking at it a year later over a 5 year time frame still ends up the best place of any asset to leave one's money in.  Risky, but in your situation, why the hell wouldn't you?
@_date: 2019-03-28 01:02:19
Of course, you can't buy bitcoin without the miners creating the network so I don't get the hostility.  As for buying always being better than mining, tell that to the whales that threw an old CPU at bitcoin and mined hundreds at the start.  For that matter look at the early ethereuem miners, you throw 150 at ETH, they bought a $150 GPU.  In eight weeks they have made back their money, and could sell the GPU and be even with the lazy buy only guy.  Instead for the next 4 years they collect more and more ETH and leave you in the dust profit wise, it isn't all that complicated.  Even if you felt it was best to only buy BTC not mine it, wouldn't the appropriate attitude be, thank you OP for making the effort to allow me to purchase BTC?  
@_date: 2019-03-23 05:27:47
There are three coins BTC, ETH, LTC.  LTC is BTC with a figure head with some authority who isn't a dick has smarts and seems honest, of course with a few techincal differences which aren't all bad.  ETH what the heck is it, its turing complete, that's for sure. A very smart teenager with a unicorn and rainbow shirt came up with it, I don't know what it does but it is the internet of things.  Serously, forget about BTC, did anyone ever, in history, generate more wealth in a shorter period of time than Vitalik Buterin, ETH went to what 60 billion dollars in a few years.  Well they lost a few hundred millions in wallets, but wow, just wow.  Problem with ETH is tens of billions of dollars attracts interest, Vitalik seems good natured, honest and bright but he doesn't have the MIT degree and tens of billions of dollars attracts interest, some of it the BCH type.  It must be tough for a non college educated (I don't think he went to college) kid in a unicorn/rainbow shirt to herd cats on a 20 billion dollar project more ambitious than bitcoin.  ETH has basically been in concrete for two years, haven't done a thing.  If ProgPOW is as good as it sounds, and if they just implemented it, ETH would double in a month and it would restore distributed GPU mining to the whole shtcoinosphere. Eventually PoS may work or it may blow up in something that makes the 300 million lost in the wallet SNAFU seem like a joke.  If it did work, eventually even BTC might have to follow.  So yes there is BTC, there is its little brother with Charlie Lee at the helm and there is Ethereum which was crazy innovative has a number of very interesting things it might do but doesn't seem able to do anything at all at the moment.  And of course there is Dogecoin, who doesn't love Dogecoin, I loved mining it.

The flippening should be a couple months away now if that, I see BNB, aka Disney Dollars closing fast on BCash. Also, doesn't Doggycoin do more transactions per day than BCash?

Along with what Wizzy said.  If miners sell most or much of their mined coins for operating expenses, etc., with only half as many coins coming every ten minutes, it could relieve that downward price pressure from new coins coming into existence and being sold.  Historically, the months leading up to and year, year and 1/2 after halving have been very, very good times for price appreciation, leading to an overshoot of reasonable values.  There have only been two halvings previously, this one won't be the same as the last going from 12.5 -&gt; 6.25, not 25 -&gt; 12.  Who knows maybe this time the decreased reward causes miners to leave, spooks the market and causes a price drop, anything can happen especially with BTC.  That said, the price behavior looks pretty similar percentage wise to previous halving cycles.  If that's the case and previous patterns hold we could be in for one hll of a bull run over next two year time frame -&gt; to be followed by the obligatory 80%+ drop ;)

Your link also states his views "predate Trump", hence if blame is to be apportioned to Presidents, former President Obama is to blame.  The border to our country has no concentration camps that's what the National Socialists did and what Democratic President FDR ordered done to Japanese Americans.  The rest of your nonsense is well-addressed down stream.  Would say Democrats have always been and remain the party of slavery.  If a person works in our country for sub minimum wage without any protections of law what are they but a slave, and that is what democrats relentlessy advocate for, enslavement of the brown people to pick thier grapes and cotten for them.

Again, as I noted upstream, I will point out what seems an obvious fallacy that is propgated by mainstream thought as beyond dispute, namely that a delfationary environment hinders economic activity.  To see the error let's consider two examples a little out there but not too far fetched.  You are thinking of buying, I don't know, a toaster because you really like toast. In one scenario you are in Venezuela, your wage after neccessities would cover a toaster, but by the end of the month it is only worth half as much due to inflation, you can't buy the toaster, if the inflation continues you only can buy neccessities and that with difficulty.  In the second scenario, your pay again could cover a toaster and at the end of a year it is worth five times more.  Your neccessities are covered for the next five years and a toaster is now only a couple hours versus a days pay.  In which scenario, inflationary or deflationary does the toaster get bought.  People like savings for the security, when this is met, people (generally) like the actual valuable things that abstract money represents such as vacations in the sun, nice homes etc., If deflation is the result of a contracting monetary supply then again someone gets screwed as their is less money to go around.  If there is say a fixed supply of money, then, however when deflation occurs it is the result of say being able to produce food ten times as inexpensively as 100 years ago, and this improvement in value leads to greater prosperity for all unless destroyed by an artificial inflation.  Artificial inflation is usurious theft.  How often do you hear the story "my parents bought that house when they were young for $22,000 and now it is worth a 1/4 million dollars".  Well the house converted into loaves of bread is probably worth around the same as when it was first bought, so just imagine how much more freedom, how many fewer worries and how many more economic purchases those parents might have made if their savings hadn't lost its value and was worth ten times as much, instead of being eaten each year by the moth of artificial inflation.

That whole argument is such nonsense.  In the inflationary theft model ( and interestingly the inflation often seems to somehow end up at ten or a hundred or a thousand percent or more per year - such big spenders these days the Venezualans) , the waitress remains a wage slave spending her entire income on neccessities.  With a currency which doesn't lose value and is stable, or as BTC is at this time, gains value, the waitress pays for neccessities and saves some money.  With the saved money she at some point decides I've always wanted a Carribean cruise and spends a portion of her savings on that. This contributes to the economic prosperity of numerous people and does not happen when the value of one's hard earned wages evaporates in one's own hands.  Sure some may pull a Smaug and forever sit on their hoard, but at the end of the day I don't think people are all that enamoured with only collecting block chain ledger entries most will say at some point, hey life is short, time to eat out, or buy that guitar or see the pyramids of Egypt or pick up that Lambo. When they do this they contribute to the wealth of those involved in making the products and it never would have happened if 3/4 of their savings value disappeared over their career due to inflation.  Inflation is just usury by another name, it is used to rob the middle class and poor blind without their consent all while being passed off as monetary policy.

No a fixed monetary supply is good for the economy.  In such a case inflation and deflation happens in response to market conditions, i.e. a bad harvest food prices are inflated, a new tractor that makes farming 10% more efficient food prices are deflated.
While two percent a year is a goal that is rarely met even in the U.S., nothing mild about 2% inflation per year.  Given a say 40 year career with a 2% inflation this means (1.02 e40) a 2.21 times loss of value of money from the end of the career versus start of the career.  What is worse, when she is no longer able to work the moth of inflation keeps eating at her already inflation depleted savings while she was able to save less as her money was worth less over time. She is poor because of the well probably 3- 4% average inflation over the past 40 years.  If she had had twice as much "money" I wonder if she would have spent more of it into the economy, had more savings for her elder retirement years and had a happier life?
Edit: One further point, I looked up the average inflation for the past 40 years from the Minneapolis Federal Reserve site [ it comes out to 3.45%, and those are the official, arguably overly conservative stats, so 1.0345 e40 = 3.88.  So from the historical data our waitress Betty lost nearly 3/4 of the value of the money she saved at the start of her career.  She really would have been twice or more as well off if her savings hadn't been robbed through artifical inflation.  Oh she was a wonderful waitress always had a smile for everyone until the rheumatism became too much for her, she is in her 80s now and never heard of bitcoin or how to get it.  Sorry, a bit carried away, but it is no joke that the current monetary arrangement whether by accident or design impoverishes people.

You sound new at this ;) No wallet will ask for your SSN, if so get far far away.  Electrum is the grand dame of desktop wallets, Exodus is very sharp and and user friendly, but they'll get you on transaction fees, i.e. 4 dollars instead of 40 cents sort of thing.  If you are talking real money, trezor or ledger hardware wallet, maybe 50 bucks for the wallet though.  If you want to have fun put coinomi wallet or some such on your phone.  There are wallets which specialize in additional annoynmity but I don't think that is what you were talking about. Almost all or maybe all, the desktop wallets are free why not download some and see what you like, then you can try some transactions with it?

Yea but why? Cause electrum is integrating LN into its next wallet? Cause some 20 something Jack Mallers Zap wallet has a way of sending funds instantly from your bank account? Cause the inflation rate is halving in a few months.  Cause the BS of BCash et al is mostly behind us? Because it's 50% off its all time high?  Cause transfer fees are low and there is a way in place for scaling? 
Sure it will likely retrace, ain't gonna see 6K like some were calling for, would be surprised but not astonished if we see 8K,  I'm calling for 12K by end of year (or Monday, haha) and if it behaves as it did the last two times with the halvening (yes, only two times, halvings are different, marketcap different etc) new ATH sometime after May.  Sure its a guess, but I would guess the past two days strongly confirms we remain in the bull market that started earlier this year.

If a third party website generates your private keys, you should assume they have a copy of those keys, along with the copy they sent you. Get a hardare wallet, or download a well established desktop wallet, make sure you are at the correct site, (can run a checksum if you're worried about the file).  Download it to a thumb drive, you could disconnect from the internet while the program installs and generates your private keys.  Only plug the thumbdrive back into an internet connected computer for the time used in making a transaction, leave it in your dresser or some such the rest of the time.  Probably easier to get a Trezor, but a wallet that is not connected to the internet except 0.1% of the time should be pretty safe.  Sorry about your loss.

I'm guessing here entirely but I think JPM coin will flop and is not intended to work.  The banks, a) don't want to legitimize crypto which threatens their revenue and power b) go outside the SWIFT system, which is used also for political ends c) the other banks wouldn't trust JPM enough to put their funds into JPM's coin, but who knows maybe they would save a few millions in fees if they get people signed up. I Don't know a lot about XRP but it seems their niche is to hope someone like JPM might use their coin, well JPM just said we made our own.  Right now the SWIFT system as decided by G20 powers and international bank of settlements or some such decide say which countries or people get sanctioned.  I give JPM a 1/100 chance of providing a backdoor to get around SWIFT through their coin, (like they wouldn't in a heartbeat use it to say evade sanctions on a country like Iran), I give XRP a snowballs chance in hell.  I think the whole JPM coin is Dimon trying to revise Dr. Evil's role in the Austin Powers movie when he does the Macarena dance for his son Scott, "Hey, I'm hip, I'm with it".  We get crypto at JPM kids so sign up for our new "cryptocool" credit card with a 9.99% three month introductory interest rate followed by 24.99% usury rate. I think the way things go forward is how BTC in a decentralized manner avoids the whole banking power structure entirely.  Then maybe in a few months the local coffee shop owner downloads a lighting wallet written by some 18 year old and everyone is using BTC or other crypto to buy coffee. Kinda longwinded but hey its Friday night :)

It is maybe "priced in" for many of the people on this reddit, though even here you might see, "have a bit of bitcoin laying around from a friend, what is this halving thing all about?"  Many people, especially older ones who generally have more wealth have no clue what bitcoin is, of those that are interested and even of those who have picked some up, probably a majority or at least significant minority haven't any idea the inflation rate is halving in a few months. If there is another price run temporally related to the halving and we only have two previous data points but I've bought into the idea I would guess much of it would be driven by new adoption and new money flowing in. Do think if there is a run it will be percentage wise less dramatic as it strikes me as a lot harder to move a 150 billion dollar market cap still think it will be quite impressive, and as the OP is saying really something in dollar terms.

I understand your distinction, good point, thx.  At the end of the day the issue is what "value" does your abstract money provide to you.  The two defintions you noted are related.  If the monetary supply greatly increases, everything becomes more expensive, all prices rise.  This is a painful fact of life for Argentina, Zimbabwe, Iran, Turkey, Venezuala, etc., yes prices rise but it is not from market conditions it is because of an artificial inflation of the monetary supply, i.e. printing money with abandon, thus destroying the wealth of those who trusted in the currency by artificially inflating prices.  Gold was/is a quasi fixed supply currency in that being scarce it was time consuming and expensive to get it out of the ground.  Unlike fiat there would never be ten perecent or ten times more gold at the end of a year than the start.   Gold unlike BTC, however, is not "infinitely" divisible so one could imagine there being too little money supply to go around for productive endeavors (i.e. not an ideal currency).  That isn't the case with BTC.  I would argue that a fixed monetary supply (that is sufficiently divisible) is ideal.  In such a case if rice goes up in price it is because of the market condition of a poor rice harvest, while potatoes went down in price from a good harvest.  At no point though does the overall purchasing power of the currency degrade from monetary supply inflation.  Could be wrong , but as BTC is heading towards a fixed monetary supply, maybe we will all find out.

If it was Finney, which I think is a reasonable guess (and even if not seeing as he received the first transaction it is a safe bet he had quite some bags before passing on) question becomes did he share his private keys with his widow or other family or friends?  I think I recall reading that even while ill some people attempted to wrest his BTC from him.  So if his widow or others have access to his BTC they would likely be very, very careful ever moving any of the early coins.  It seemed to be a very supportive marriage and given Finney's belief in BTC would make sense he might have passed it along to his family.  Then again, there is the very smallest chance his wife might have been.

Historically it has been a very good, though also very volatile investment.  If you do buy some and put it on a wallet understand you are responsible for it, i.e. back-up your private key passwords, make sure the passwords aren't shared and are safe.  It would be bad if it turned out to be a good investment, you had put some on a wallet on your phone, lost the phone and realized you had no idea how to recover the funds, so lost the investment as well.  My guess is is this is a decent time to buy, Good luck!

Given those 123,000 citations perhaps Mr. North, as with Y2K, is again spectaculary in error and just has not found the source material.
"He said that her research as a whole was '**piss poor** and that SHE is wrong.' " Please provide the "piss poor" citation from Mr. North, or are you are in error with your quote?  (Also you meant Gary North, not "Gary Allen" huh?)
I don't see from a half minute review of Ms. Brown's website or blog any 180 degree change in position.  Perhaps you care to be more specific?  Ellen has always felt that Government fiat money created as credit was a viable and desirable alternative to bank created currency as debt.  It is the theme of her book if you have read it. Personally, a currency that is "infinitely" divisible, out of government's hands, created as credit, and of limited supply strikes me as ideal which is exactly where we are going with bitcoin.  But yes I still trust Ms. Brown's 500+ pages of research and don't dismiss it on the basis of a century old quote, peripheral to the main body of her work, that is either difficult to attribute or widely cited erroneously.

This is just Dr. Evil doing the Macarana for Scotty, "I'm with it, I'm cool, I crypto".  There will be no cryptocurrency, there will be something completely opaque, completely centrally controlled with no one knowing who is controlling it.  The ledger will be open to revision and currency issuance controlled by an anonymous committee issuing its decrees to the central bank branches to serve as the mouth of Sauron.  Bankers realize bitcoin is a threat, they have no idea what it is or how it works but they know shell games and if they can convince people that bitcoin isn't bitcoin, this thing we control is the real bitcoin (i.e. see former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summer's involvement with Bcash) then the problem is mitigated.  I seriously doubt they will ever issue a coin but if they issue FedCoin they'll likely trot out Morgan Freeman and Bono and Peyton Manning to say look kids its the really, really cool FedCoin, way cooler than Bitcoin get your new super Green KryptoKard today backed by FedCoin and get 0.5% cash back on all qualifying purchases!!! (33% APR on all cash advances and outstanding balances, default on terms of service may result in confiscation of first born or loss of one to three limbs at discretion of customer.  Terms of service subject to change without warning, no purchases are qualifying purchases). Either that or if they ever thought they could pull it off, issue a FedCoin or Worldcoin than ban bitcoin mining worldwide as harmful to the environment.  Actually I don't think the financial industry is that monolithic and suspect there are also influential people supporting it and pulling for it, but would suspect some bankers go to sleep at night dreaming of how to destroy bitcoin.  Last point is the more bitcoin increases in value the more disruptive it would be for it to go away quickly, eventually BTC may be too big to fail, hence perhaps the attempts will be to try and co-opt it.

I don't know what the bank fees might be, there is one video [ showing 0 as in "zero" fees.  Maybe even more important, one's wealth is in one of two places with this set-up a) in a bank b) in a wallet where you control the keys.  Yes there is KYC involved, there is already KYC involved for exchanges, what this does is solve the problem of not your keys not your coins.  Again, this is beta, but if it works well and if atomic swaps with other cryptos eventually can occur on lightning wallets it could put all the exchanges out of business and one would never need to worry about another Mt.

For a reputable business not worth the reddit/twitter storm of "this fckr ripped me off".  Good point though.  The transactions are "permanently" recorded, so if it ever became an issue the solution would be to have the public key where you are sending the funds included in your invoice.  So you could save or screenshot, this is NewEgg or Amazon, etc., this is where they said to send the money, the transaction ledger shows I sent the money to that address.  But yes, if buying vape stuff or other stuff over the internet why not just put it out there and say see ya sucker, would work a time or two.

While the technicals were overbought a year ago, a large part of the destruction of well over 100 billion dollars of wealth, held in part by many on this forum was from the lies and antics (spamming the mem pool) of this azhat and the associated motley crew of criminals, frauds and incompetents. It is helpful for everyone involved with or interested in BTC to know this.

Yes, they could try to corner the market.  While corrupt there should be some regulations, i.e. if hundreds of billions of dollars just showed up to buy bitcoin, there could be people saying that is destroying the fiat currency through inflation, as well a significant percentage of bitcoin has never budged, these people would become far wealthier than they already are. Third, at least since the Federal Reserve act, money primarily comes into existence as debt, i.e. when there is a loan for 10,000 the banker just creates that money out of thin air into a ledger and tells the customer you have ten thousand dollars, now you have to pay me back 10,000 at 5% interest. the money for the interest is never created so in order to pay back principle + interest someone else must go into debt.  It is literally a ponzi scheme designed to indebt all people to banks.  If money is printed without corresponding debt it is a credit.  So in the case of printing credit money to buy up bitcoin it would actually help people get out from under the banks thumb. Lastly, most importantly, the value of bitcoin derives in significant part from its community.  If suddenly the only BTC available was the GS special reserve BTC note with its 2% transfer fees (to make sure there's no fraud and money laudering and stuff, and really the note is backed fractionally by a genuine BTC, really) then after shovelling hundreds of billions of debt free money at people, making them fabulously rich as opposed to indebted, debasing and eroding confidence in their own controlled fiat currency, demonstrating the viability and value of crypto, people say, you know litecoin isn't a bad alternative and I hear the original BTC developers are gonna release BTC gen2.  What then, give out another trillion in free money to the people you are trying to get into debt?  It is a good argument for the existence of altcoins.  If BTC was ever co-opted in some form or another there are a dozen coins that could take its place, personally I wouldn't mind seeing Dogecoin as top dog.  ;)  Rather then spend money what the line of attack has been so far is to try and convince people that a random shtcoin is better than or actually is BTC.  That hasn't worked for BCH or PetroCoin and doubt it will work for JPM coin or Libra Coin. But if all BTC ended up in the hands of bankers, well just use a different coin. Just as a last thought that occured to me in a sense we the BTC community can print as much money as we like as well by attaching value to crypto.  Buying into it from the controlled fiat banking world only validates crypto and degrades their currency.

I don't know about XRP, not sure they are even a cryptocurrency and their niche would seem to be the same thing as JPM coin. Outside of BTC, ETH is at least a real coin, it's "Turing complete" whatever that's supposed to mean and unicorns and rainbows. Really it has had a biff effect, big community, heckeva a lot of tokens, but the whole "cat-herder" committees joke is getting stale as they have been stuck in molasses with developmentfor seemingly years, and if they ever do manage to move to PoS who knows if that helps the coin or kills it.  Litecoin, gota like it, second coin ever, Charlie Lee - MIT, polite community.  Unlike BCH isn't always threatening to send BTC into a "death spiral".  Would avoid coins like BCH that have a felon for its spokeman or BSV delusonal nutjob who thinks he is Napolian for its figure head.  There are plenty of other decent or interesting alts, Monero, Nano strikes me as interesting, of course Dogecoin, who couldn't like Doge coin. Alts may yet have their day again, but right now and for likely awhile it is the all BTC show, and I think a lot of alts will get rekt, At least LTC and ETH have weathered some storms before. XRP, eehhh, what the heck is it but a centralized database and why won't JPM coin do the same thing?

To be honest, if I had to guess, I would say at this price maybe just dollar cost average in a bit.  Its gone from 3200 to 9000+ in a few months, yes its pulled back a bit, but the weekly stochastic is still pinned above 80 I wouldn't be surpised if there wasn't a healthy correction to the 6000-7000 range here in the next few weeks. The move from April till now has been pretty parabolic, maybe it just keeps rocketing to 20,000, BTC does whatever it wants, but I would actually prefer a correction so you don't have to start worrying about some 80% collapase again.  I have a portion that I trade with and a portion from a mining "garden" that I leave alone, so for the trading part I also just want to talk through it for myself, but I'll give you my crystal ball which may be cloudy.  I think near term looks like we may test 9000 again, maybe ten thousand but I doubt it, probably stopped at 9.  after that meander around 8.5-9k for awhile, longer it stays there less severe the correction, but will probably correct to 7000 maybe, 6,000 maybe 5,000 but I doubt it.  At some point before end of year we see 12000.  3,200 -&gt;12,000 \~4 fold. So if we are in a bull market 48,000 sometime next year.  Charlie Lee, (Litecoin Founder MIT guy) came up with a really interesting model for predicting bitcoin price that he wrote up a few weeks back.  According to his model BTC should hit 55,000 in 2020, that would be nice.  So yea probably not a bad time to buy, but I wouldn't be surpised if it drops 20-30% from where it is now at some point in the next couple months.

Actually he has a very good case.  The employee of ATT "sold" his SIM card for personal gain.  This also occurred after ATT was specifically instructed not to change his SIM card a second time and their terms of service say they will obey those requests. ATT hired a grifter who had a known history of selling SIM cards for personal gain against ATT rules. ATT need to compensate the man for his loss, in this case it happened to be BTC, but it could have been anything, for instance death or injury from one's phone no longer working because a thief working for ATT sold the SIM card.

Price is currently $7,892 on Binance.   I declare this the end of the current mini Bear market, Thus have I spoken, thus shall it be.  But seriously, the one week stochasitic is bottomed out, if it goes much lower you have to say maybe the whole run up this year was a head fake. It has dropped from just under 14,000 to 8,000 in under 4 months, what sort of better entry price are you looking for?  Maybe a couple or few percent lower but either we have exited the 2018 bear market or we haven't.  I do think we might rattle around at this level to 10K or 11K maybe even till the end of the year. Apologize for butting in with what could be terrible advice, but I would say I agree there is a decent chance this is an opportunity similar to the one you regret having missed out on (of course, even if you agree with me don't put every single penny you have into BTC that would just be crazy!)

The most obvious answer in all this is Craig doen't have much money, BTC or otherwise. 1) If you had ten billion dollars worth of bitcoin why would any of this be happening, you would be unknown enjoying life on a beach in Tahiti, if Klieman's estate did find you, there would be an army of lawyers working out a settlement. 2) Why did NChain have to pay off all Craig's illegal tax debts before he could start working there and selling himself as Satoshi, why would he be in debt?  Why couldn't he pay it himself especially as it put him in legal jeopardy.   3) Why would you disclose you held large sums of BTC, others including Hal Finney very early on were attacked once BTC became valuable. 4) Why in 2018 when your BTC holding were worth well in excess of 20 Billion dollars would you start criticizing "your" creation,saying it was slow, expensive, couldn't scale, and would be sent into a death spiral by BCH  you would have 20 billion reasons not to and to work with your original creation. Unless of course you had actually missed out on the whole BTC thing and were trying to recreate your own bitconnect version of it to profit on that wave. None of Craig's behaviour makes any sense, including being tied up in court and submitting back dated fraudulent documents unless he is viewed as a con man playing a confidence game.  Then of course he would want to be seen as Bitcoin billionaire, telling people he has more money than their entire country, walking on stage with a wheelbarrow full of degrees, claiming he is Satoshi the brains behind bitcoin, suing anyone who says he is a conman and a fraud, which he is.  Likely he is funded by Calvin Ayres who has money and wants a cryptocurrency he controls as a means of laundering gambling money.  The con is two fold a) the controlled centralized crypto originally BCH now BSV, b) sale of IP from the great genius Satoshi Nakamoto.  Ironically Klieman, though not Craig, likely mined a lot of crypto, but Craig is not going to be able to break that encryption.  The judge, aside from curiosity, likely doesn't give a rat's behind if Craig calls himself Satoshi or anything else, there was a lawsuit that assets belonging to one person actually belong to another.  The judge is asking for evidence of the assets as the place to start, given the immutability of the blockchain (Satoshi's revenge) this should be easy enought to produce, right Craig?  If he doesn't produce it, like a third grader without his homework a) all his I AM SATOSHI!! BS goes up in smoke as does the selling IP based on the fraud that the chief scientist is Nakomota, yet in all liklihood he can't produce the evidence as he probably doesn't have ten BTC to his name, so he gets fined and is broke again or even placed in prison.  Will he rather face fines/imprisoment or admit he is not Satoshi? That's a tough one, but decent chance CSW goes to jail for playing at being Nakamoto, because we haven't even touched on the fraudulent documents he has submitted to the court.

They are a business which makes money off money and BTC is a threat to their revenue.  They are doing this for two reasons 1) to try and co-opt cryptos into a centralized, controlled system that they profit from at your expense 2) barring that I would not for a second put it past them to move a few zeros on their real internal bank ledger then the next day say we lost 1 billion dollars on a faulty blockchain transaction, we never saw this coming.  And all the mockingbird media would start singing along "World on edge as fatal flaw discovered in Blockchain" "Why banks are a good idea after all, are you FIDC insured? "  "How bitcoin failed and what you can do to protect yoursef" "Five things you need to know about the blockchain meltdown" etc. etc.   For that matter we know so little about the coin you can't even be sure there is one. What algorithim secures it, is it POS, POW, what is the issuance rate, if the blockchain ledger is only on the internal servers that house their day to day ledger why would it be more reliable or secure than their currently encrypted ledger? As it is top down controlled they don't need to reach consensus, why not just change their encryption every ten minutes on their current ledger, if they don't do this already.  Just an unnecessary level of complexity, expense and energy added with mining then reaching consensus.  I see this basically as Dr. Evil trying to do the Macarana for Scotty "I'm hip, I'm with it".

There is a fixed mining reward for each block which is solved on average every ten minutes.  The current reward leads to an annual inflation rate of about 4%.  If more people mine, diffculty adjusts upward to keep average block time at ten minutes.  With more people mining the chance (or average if mining with a pool) of a payout to an individual goes down.  They can add more mining power and this process continues until it is no longer worth the cost of machines/electricity to add further computing power.  What we saw in 2107-2018 was the price of BTC increase so rapidly that ASIC suppliers couldn't keep pace.  A mining rig sold for a fortune, and people mining were making money hand over foot. So did ASIC suppliers like Bitmain.  2018-2019 price fell off a cliff, mining rigs became dirt cheap, didn't matter as mining didn't even cover the cost of electricity.  A lot of mining farms went bankrupt, less miners meant more rewards for the ones able to tough it out, difficulty adjusted downwards and ASIC suppliers got their shirt handed to them, some people think Bitmain is essentially broke at this time.  Eventually the system may settle down and miners would make a decent steady profit over and above the cost of electricity depreciation of equipment, but for now it still looks like boom and bust. Eventually, in decades, it is designed that miners make their profit from transaction fees not the block reward, as there will be no more block rewards and inflation will be zero, negative if you count lost coins.

Are you serious?! And you are getting 15% more income?! Well one thing you could do would be open a Coinbase or Gemini account link it to your banck account.  Then, when you get paid 50% of your salary +15% bonus, transfer, the same day 60%, to CB or Gemini and then immediately to your bank leaving 5% of BTC in your personal wallet. As there will probably be maybe a 2% or so conversion fee to fiat this would be effectively giving you an 8% pay raise plus putting 5% of your salary monthly salary into BTC while dollar cost averaging each month.  I would see the main risks as 1) the whole crytosphere blows up 2) CB or Gemini gets hacked on the same day you transfer them some money 3) BTC drops 10% the day you transfer the money.  Of course depending on your feelings about BTC, current level of risk you wish to take etc you could play with the numbers all the way to leaving all 65% in BTC.  However, barring some pretty imho unlikely events occuring it looks to me like you have a way of giving yourself a raise while getting your foot in the door with BTC at the same time without a terrible amout of risk, my understanding is CB is FDIC insured.
Edit: Just thought you might want to think about taxes with this scenario not sure how that would factor in.

Coinbase is "mainstream", they are also likely looking for ways to co-opt BTC into a legacy financial system.  That said there hasn't been the loss of billions of dollars as seen with the magic the gathering trading cards Japanese exchange.  They are "the man" also while not tested they say US dollars are FDIC insured on thier exchange and there is a legal system of dealing with disputes for U.S. citizens.

You would need to research it yourself but any number of reasons.  Integral to development of PGP, active on cypherpunk lists, lived in same town just a few blocks away from Satoshi Nakamota, Received Genesis Block Payment, (sort of a big one) key person in early bitcoin development.  As for why he didn't say it was him, a) the technology should stand on its own and has a lot to with ciphers as well as being decentralized  b) he didn't have a death wish, given that, (with the message in the genesis block) he well knew he was going after the revenue stream of multi-trillion dollar international banking, maybe, just maybe that would be a good time to publish under a nom de plume.  Given BTC's 89 billion dollar current market cap, not an unreasonable precaution, even given all the precautions he was swatted just for being an obvious early adopter.  Not saying there couldn't have been a consortium of individuals involved, but I would say the insight of the PoW blockchain to eliminate double spending was most likely Finney's idea.

Well again because the perceived value of the coin would be related to its usefullness in indexing the world's electronically available information and in order to obtain the coin one would need to likewise have some computing power dedicated to indexing.

"how do you verify the indexing is correct?"
There are a number of very good open source web crawlers.  Pick one and code such that only data generated by the crawler is accepted.
"do you just trust the miners that the indexing is correct?"
There would be a disincentive to submit garbage as the value of the coin would be tied to the worth of the information generated by the crawlers, however that does seem to the thornier problem.  Let's consider a couple scenarios.  1) an Erc 20 token, the token is distributed based from a percentage of pages indexed in the past 24 hours, so 1000 pages indexed in the past 24 hours one gets a coin after indexing 10 pages, 1,000,000 pages indexed in the past 24 hours one gets a coin after indexing 10,000 pages.  However, as the resulting indexed database would be opensource and available for anyone to attach an open source search engine to, or download in its entirety, what would stop someone from just resubmitting a portion of the already indexed database.  Would it be trivial or exceedlingly difficult to confirm that someone has actually indexed as opposed to cut and pasted?  Perhaps a crytographic key could be generated after the threshold for indexing/coin issuance is achieved and this key would allow for distribution of the coin?  2) A hybrid PoW/indexing approach.  In this case one would be forced to devote 50% of compute power to indexing before one could work on the blockchain, the reward being the issuance of coin from the blockchain, how can you have your pudding if you don't eat your meat?  In this case the question becomes is it trivial or exceedlingly difficult to code the mining such that miners could not game the system by foregoing the indexing part?  These questions may be above my paygrade but whether or not there can be a distributed, opensource alternative to closed commercial indexes of the internet is imo worth debating.  
 "the core problem is that the proof-of-work algorithm simply cannot be tied to anything that is otherwise useful." 
Oh I disagree entirely, just consider PowerLedger as one top 100 coin example.  Even the banksters prattel on and on about how useful and valuable blockchain is, just not bitcoin.  I am waiting for them to issue "DebtCoin" you get it and then have to pay them 3% every year if you have it. /s

"How can we make loans while preserving anonymity" I don't know how would you do that with fiat, how does your bank do it?  They don't of course, I would consider an anonymous loan akin to finding a 20 bill on the sidewalk.   As for the rest, I would imagine the same person or people you would trust as executors of your estate in case the need ever arose.

I don't get the hostility, its okay if you don't think Finney was Satoshi, I do.  You haven't made note of any of the valid points I gave in support and are talking about pen names.  The work was published, purposefully, this is beyond dispute annonymously, not under a pen name where the real author may be easily uncovered.  Therefore it is also impossible to know if Hal or anyone else for that matter may have been behind other work released anonymously, most likely not, but the argument that he never published anonymously before, well that doesn't make sense.  As for the objection that he could never have seen the impact of BTC, aside from the banking reference in the genesis block an early comment by Satoshi was along the lines of either bitcoin will fail or in some years be so big as to be self sustaining from transaction fees (it is designed that way), so the potential was recognized, and again the threat this potential posed to trillion dollar competing interests would have been recognized.  Its fine if you think Hal isn't Satoshi, it's fine if Hal wasn't Satoshi, I've presented some valid points for why he was, no need to start with "you people", which people? are delusional, it really isn't that big a deal to me.  I'm old enough to remember when it used to be fun to talk about the weather.

Yes have heard of Google.  The internet has become the library of the world and the indexing and access to this information is currently controlled by a few and primarily one centralized corporate concern that answers to stockholders.  There is a fellow in Germany I believe, this is from a year ago and I would need to relook everything up, however he has a webcrawler you can use and search on a specific term.  You find a lot more and more varied information if you crawl the web yourself.  The results of your search are included in his database along with those of others.  Unfortunately as only a small number of people use his crawler the results of his search engine are spotty at best without taking an hour to crawl the term yourself. If crawling the internet were incentivized it would have great public utility.
@_date: 2019-04-17 06:24:11
I agree entirely, also because he seems to be a congenital liar,  but I would still say his best course of action is to stop digging, plead for any kind of  settlement with Klienman or however you spell it and drop all other litigation.  If this was submitted as a legal court document he is REKT, the Kleinman estate is after him and if the OPs analysis is correct CW just commited a felony. I can imagine his lawyers just love him now.  Guess we will also see whether he has deep pockets to try and drag this out or is near insolvent.  Just wildly speculating now, but given that CW needed 15 million dollars from nChain to pay off previous business debts, after BTC was already worth billions to tens of billions of dollars, given his history of lying there is a very decent chance he is not any sort of early miner BTC whale at all.  Perhaps he is being propped up financially by Calvin Ayres.  Time will tell if he has, what did he say at a speech when he was in Uganda or some such, "I have more money than your entire country" cause he may likely need it to avoid a significant jail sentence.  Poor Craig, poor, poor Craig, even that wheelbarow full of diplomas you brought up on stage can't get you out of this one.

I don't think "Bitcoin mining process is a waste of energy and resources because (it is) not tied to any real world problem" actually I think bitcoin mining is tied to a very importanat real world problem.

Agree that BTC should not be tied to it, it already has its job.  However, there are altcoins tied to distributed trading platforms, distributed social networks, distributed solar power grids, distributed AI, etc. Internet Search is a highly centralized and "rather" large market, if possible it should be incentivized to exist as a self-sustaining distributed endeavor.  Heck BTC is already a threat to established systems of banking, what no one wants to go after the centralized established gatekeeper(s) for information?
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:00:46
Well, again I am neither an engineer nor software programmer, however in the simplest approach you have a standard PoW blockchain, however it is coded that when mining "Indexcoin" half the compute power must be dedicated to indexing the internet, before (or while) working on solving the block.  The indexed database would not be included on the blockchain, it would just basically become a public utility that any third party could tap into to provide a search engine. Given all the smart programmers out there there might even be some way to tie the process of indexing directly to solving blocks, I don't know. But in this simple example indexing piggybacks on a traditional proof of work blockchain and if you want to play you have to devote half the miners power to indexing.

That is huge. Talk about hoisted on his own petard.  If that was submitted as evidence to the court it is out of his hands now, is a very significant lie and is demonstrably fraudulent.  This is no longer he said she said on the internet this is a legal document submitted to the court.  There go all the libel cases as well as any judge who knows that he has a history of submitting fraudulent documents to court will have a field day with him.  In all honesty, as a favor to Craig, his best bet now is to drop all litigation he has initiated, apologize profusely and repeatedly to all involved for the hurt and damage he has caused to attempt to avoid jail time.  He should note he has a failing and will be seeking help, might be too late. A five billion dollar lawsuit is likely going to be a pretty watched case and while I am not a lawyer my understanding is falsifying court documents is a felony.

Don't use an online wallet.  Local wallets, where you control the keys to your wallet, are pretty much all free.  Electrum has been around a long time and is used a lot. I like Exodus because the user interface is nice, but they have bad transfer fees.  You could download as many of them as you like before you have any BTC, just to see what you like.  Alternatively as it is not too much money you could put the wallet on your phone.  I've used Coinomi, they've had a few hiccups, but have worked fine.  One point I would stress, when you do put some BTC in the wallet, there will be a back-up phrase of 12-16 words, write that down, don't store it on your phone or computer, don't lose it and don't share it.  Say you put 50 bucks of BTC on your phone and lost your phone.  If you don't have that back-up phrase that serves as a key to your wallet, then you lost your phone and wallet on the same day. 
Exchanges are like stock exchanges, just in this case where BTC trades against other cryptocurrencies and different national currencies.  When they say the price of BTC is such and such dollars that comes from the price of BTC on the exchanges.   Where to buy, probably an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or others, I think though not certain Binance may be kaput in the U.S. at the moment because of difficulties with regulators.  Binance is/was based out of China, Coinbase and Gemini are U.S. based.  Exchanges have a bad name as especially early on they were prone to being hacked and going out of business, if you haven't yet, read up on the Mt.Gox exchange. poof a billion dollars gone in a week-end.  That's part of why people say, "not your keys, not your coins".  Things appear somewhat better now, but still if you aren't trading the BTC for other coins or currencies, should look to keep it on your wallet and not on an exchange owned by someone else.  There's more and things keep changing rapidly, who knows what will happen with lightning wallets (transactions that take &lt; second instead of tens of minutes) but you'll figure it out.

Seems to me the thing to do is install linux on a thumb drive with a couple gigabytes of persisent memory, put your wallet on there.  Unplug the thing or make a few of them and store them where you want. Costs maybe 5 bucks.  Is this any less secure than a trezor or other hardware wallet and if so why? Granted if you check the wallet say once a week there are a few minutes where you are connected to the internet but this would have to happen with any hardware wallet right? Would also have the advantage that if you travel just take the thumb drive stick it any computer and have it boot from the thumb drive.  Am I missing anything here?
