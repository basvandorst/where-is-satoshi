I'm currently in target retirement 2060 fund at about 9% increase some inception.  That is very good, however if I can potentially see higher returns I can accept higher risk.  However I haven't decided if btc' s risk is too high.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:44:40
Ok but can I ask why?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:45:37
I do believe in it.  I only believe in it more and more as I hear baby boomers talking abjout it at work lately non stop.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:46:07
Thanks for answering but can you elaborate a bit on why not?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:16:43
Ya 8 days is a pretty long time
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:19:14
I have responded in another comment I think if I pull it out I'm betting it goes above $16,000.  That is a general ballpark of what I would lose to penalty and early withdrawal.  I'm confident it will, but am I willing to bet my family future on it, not sure yet.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:53:45
I understand that.  It would be a risk, and I haven't come to a decision on if I will or not but no one ever made money playing it safe.  
I hope this doesn't come off as me just looking for people to only give me the answer I want to hear but I am leaning towards doing it.  My current mind set is I can live with myself if I lost this money, assuming I can make it up throughout my life span fairly quickly.  As opposed to say projections of $100,000 by 2020 are right and all that potential rewards from my risk would be much greater in my eyes.  I only used $100,000 as an example not what I expect or assume will happen btw.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:06:34
This is why I created this post.  Not to hear it's a casino blah blah.  You have brought up a great point thank you I will check some math and see if it's a wise strategy still.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:06
Ofc not bc I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:02:47
Also does anyone know why gdax and bittrex are like $1000 difference on BTC price
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:15:27
Spoiler alert! Jesus I can't go anywhere with out GoT spoilers I guess back to my Nokia phone so I can watch everything in 2020 with out spoliers.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:04:49
It is a risk, but so is 401k.  Yes it's a higher risk but the market could crash like in 2008-2009 and I could just as easily lose 50% or more then also.  
I'm not disagreeing with you, it is a risk but it's not a casino risk like black or red. IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:08:40
Thank you for this.  You and another commenter are saying bacisally the same thing.  This is a great idea and takes a lot of the "Emotional" aspect out of this which could save me a decent sum of money come the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:00:02
Thank you for responding but can you explain why you feel it's that bad?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:17:20
I agree with not waiting for the dip.  Just the saying but what you can afford to lose, which is where I don't see or feel this money now.  I'm only 30 and if it went bad my 60y/o self would be kicking my ass.  However if it goes well my 40 y/o self would be giving me high fives.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:29:38
I know, however auto correct fixed and can't change title.  O well just adds to the novelty of the situation.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:59:19
That is the only reason I'm debating this in my mind.  Tax free money slowly gaining interest.  If I pull out I take a 10% hit for early withdrawal and then pay 25%ish taxes on it that year also.   
The argument I have in my head is a  35% loss would mean breaking even if BTC crosses the 16,000 per coin line.  Which I believe it will.  Unless I'm absolutely wrong here lol.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:55:03
So something along the lines of take out money and invest that amount over say 12 equal payments every 2 weeks over 6 months?  
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:42:31
Sorry I really didn't think would get anywhere I was just kidding I've seen them all.  However I don't watch them live so this will help when the new season does come out
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:46:58
I have currently lowered it from 15% to 6% as that is the max my company will match to.  I won't go lower then that as free money is still free money.  I am putting the difference in already as you stated just trying to catch it before it takes off higher.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:03:34
Ya to buy more BTC
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:44:03
I would make payments deducted from my paycheck.  Even after that is deducted it does not put much of a strain on our quality of life.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:37:42
Ya I did something similar at around 15K in 2017 and then more 18K.  Saw a nice jump and then a massive drop off, I lost my shit but took to the mantra "it's only lost if I pull it out".  I kept it in there and after about 6 months I could see the forest through the trees and began to add through out the next year.  As of today I am officially UP!  Who knows what tomorrow brings but I have lived this long with out the money and added more so up or down its just going to chill.  Up or down, in my eyes its a ride either way.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:31:06
Call it what you like, as long as someone is taking advantage of my losses!
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:35:53
Did we just become best friends.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:10:01
I've never tried the wire.  But this 2-4 days bank is killing me.  I hate not having it when I want it.  Have you tried wire? Is it very simple?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:38:31
So what you're saying is that you're the real person to blame.  Good to know, i'm keeping my eye on you lonzu85!
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:00:39
Na next week.  I have a larger portion being deposited in 2-4 days.  Let's wait till that clears first! Thanks for your patience lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:48:44
Got some more pending, should clear tomorrow.  I guess I will have to let everyone know when that clears so you guys can get your wallets ready!
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:54:25
As long as my deposit through Gdax goes through I will def buy more tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:11:59
I feel ya brother 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:37:06
Wire transfer on GDAX.  As long as it's in by 1 or 2 PM it will arrive same day.  I did one on Monday and about 4 hours later it was in my account.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:32:02
Best part is, I have about 4x's as much pending that I expect to receive tomorrow to buy.  So i'm good with the dropping so I can buy more tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:39:48
$60 down at the moment, up 1800 by Dec 1st!
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:56:32
Got a bitcoin Ticker Widget on my phones home screen, Gdax set as home page on PC, and a BTC ticker chrome app running.  So way way too much.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:41:51
I'm new, I guess in the future I will give everyone a 5 minute heads up so everyone will be able to take full advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:27:54
Good for you man.  Some random stranger on reddit is very happy for you.  Hope I can get in a situation similar to yours one day.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:51:06
We appreciate your sacrifice 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:57:30
Team-work makes the DREAM-work!
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:13:30
I do that but it's still the waiting that is like to avoid.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:16
Hey lose a little today to gain a lot tomorrow.  HODL
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:46:11
I wish I had wire transferred to GDAX rather then bank transfer.  10 days, $2000 difference.  So much potential but lesson learned could have been worse.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:36:03
OFC, 12 mins later drops almost $100 lol every time
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:37:17
Almost dropped $100 12 mins after I bought.  O well marathon not a sprint.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:39:48
Good, everyone should be getting involved now hopefully it continues to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:39:45
Almost $200 now, I think for $3000 you will be hibernating for a while.  Make sure to eat enough to get you through the long Winter.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:11:17
I used CC on coinbase but they kept cancel my orders even when I'm under weekly limit.  Then my limit dropped from $1250 weekly to $100.  Useless 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:35:36
That's still a nice average between the 2 though good job.
