False.   You must be sued in order to be garnished.  If you're sued and lose, it doesn't matter if you're garnishable or not - your house can be taken instead, your credit will be ruined and you'll still own the debt.   Nice try but this meme is stupid.

If you wouldn't hold on to a stupid argument with everything you have despite everyone here telling you how wrong you are, there wouldn't be a reason to insult you.   You're being stupid, so we're calling you stupid.   It's not really an insult, it's a fact. 
I love how you can flat out ignore facts and provide some dumbass explanation about why you're right and EVERYBODY else here is wrong.   Keep it up please - you're a one-man comedy goldmine. :)

You're easily the stupidest person I've ever seen on Reddit.   By far. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:11:10
Enjoy all the downvotes you're getting in this thread.   They're well deserved.   The most pitiful thing about it is that you're just sticking to your guns, insisting that you're right lol.   You're not.   You're dumb.   
Here, I'll throw you a bone...
tell us again how the most widely accepted currency in the world isn't generally accepted anywhere LOL
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:12:30
Yep, I can read.    You wrote:


Which is stupid.   It's generally accepted all around the world, which logic tells us includes **just one country** fifty times over. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:15:49
Yes, it works great.   You obviously haven't.   
I'll just leave this here  
Just because you believe your own bullshit doesn't mean it's not bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:50:41
I'm sure that's a nice thing to tell yourself but we can look at reality and see that what you're saying is flat out false.  Nobody is printing up their own fiat currencies but new cryptocurrencies with market caps of millions or even billions are popping up every single day.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:34:48
Please tell us how "recognized as a global currency and accepted all around the globe" bends the definition of "generally accepted"
Actually, don't.  You seem like the type of Dunning-Kruger that would believe his own bullshit.

This whole subreddit took pride and joy in giving his coin their own derogatory name.  Throw a jab get jabbed right back - that's the way of the world.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:29:48
Ever heard of the petro-dollar?  It's a world reserve currency for fuck's sake.  I'm with the other guy - your post is totally stupid.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:53:38
No, it's stupid.

I was about to leave a casino in Vegas when, right before I got to the door, I reached into my pocket and found a $50 chip that I'd forgotten about.  I threw it on a craps table and let it roll.   Walked away with about $750.    For those of you that think craps is a scam, read em and weep.

All of your comments are being downvoted here because everthing you say is stupid.  Doubling down just makes you look stupider.

He's making a point about liquidity, not price.  The longer the transaction backlog is, the longer (and likely more expensive) it takes for your transactions to process.  If the price tanks in a matter of hours but you're unable to transact for days, that is, for all intents and purposes, a lack of liquidity.   Obviously not being able to sell when you want  to sell is a bad thing when it comes to investing - and it's an even bigger problem when you're talking about a currency.  An illiquid currency is hardly a currency at all.

This is actually perfect.   Each tree is a new blockchain with its own token -- Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, etc. etc. etc....   there's no limit to the  number of cryptocurrencies that can sprout up out of nowhere.   Not sure how you guys see that as scarcity.   21 million coins my ass.   There is literally an infinite supply of magic digital tokens in the sky that can move value from point A to point B.

Actually, the average price of a movie in 1970 was $1.55 and minimum wage was $1.60/hour.   
Movies today average about $9, and minimum wage today is $11.50/hour.  
You're confusing bullshit with math.

50 years??   If I have to hold my investments for 50 years before I can use them, they're shitty investments.   Good luck with that, see you in 2068 lol

You said you're never paying fees.  It doesn't matter if you're up $60000000000000000000000000 - it's not going anywhere unless you pay the piper bud.   
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:52
That's proof to you?  LOL You shouldn't have dropped out in the 4th grade man, there's a lot more for you to learn.      
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:06:34
erm, no.   Nice try though lol.   
You've been 100% wrong on everything here.   
You should delete this whole cringeworthy post.

To say the drama isn't real is completely disingenuous.   It's very real and impacting everything.  
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:03:07
Are you fucking serious?   "No evidence to back it up besides their gut"??    "Do you even read" is a very good question, how does the guy who asked that have negative karma.   I'll  ask it again:  DO YOU EVEN READ?   Because it doesn't seem like you do.   
Hope you enjoyed the downvote - it doesn't change the fact that what you wrote is fucking stupid.

You're no match for Peter Schiff - he'll eat you alive.
And comments have been disabled on your channel forever - if they're enabled now, that's a new thing.


Well that's convenient.  Like I said, that's your M.O. - you don't ever actually debate people with valid skepticisms and concerns, you just mute them or ignore them.
Preaching from a soap-box, where you get to set the premises without being challenged on them  - that's your thing.   Not debate.  You'd have a hard time getting past square one against Peter with some of the premises you base your sermons on.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:26:55
Andreas is good at preaching, not debate.  That's why comments are disabled on all his YouTube videos - he has no response for all the "trolls" who disagree with him, aside from calling them trolls.  Schiff would shit on Andreas.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:24:06
I'm sure that's fun to say, but that's not what's actually happening.  Bcash is trending away from zero and so is ethereum. If they're inferior they should simply vanish according to you - but you and I both know that isn't happening so quit trying to pretend it is.   Go look at the ETH price chart since the beginning and then come back here and tell me it's "trending toward zero"... But try to keep a straight face lol.  Then do the same for BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:17:30
Andeas won't accept a debate with Peter because he knows how it'll go.  I've never seen Andreas engage in a rigorous, intellectually honest debate, and I never expect to.    Peter predicted that bitcoin clones would emerge and would show that scarcity in cryptos is a farce - sure enough, BCH and ETH (and others) are proving him right.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:43:40
If he has half a brain he probably thinks, "A config setting in software that can be re-implemented as many times as humanity desires...  LOL that's not how scarcity works.  Let's see you try to fork an acre of land."  How many "alternate acres" can you spin off of the original?  ZERO??  Hrmm now that sounds like real, physical scarcity.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:56:47
Asking this community if you should invest in bitcoin is like asking if you should play kickball.  Wtf do you expect them to say, "no"?

But.... it's a currency.   You're supposed to be able to buy things when you need them with currencies.   You shouldn't have to HODL through extreme volatility just be able to pay your mortgage or buy some groceries.   That's the nice thing about real money --you guys like to complain that the the USD is losing value so hard - but at least I can HODL my monthly expenses in dollars and still have what I need at the end of the month.   Who the hell needs a "currency" that loses a third of it's value in a week?   Not me.    I don't have the luxury of HODLing until my mortage payment magically comes back from the abyss.  HODLING is for speculators, not for people who need to use their currency like a currency.
