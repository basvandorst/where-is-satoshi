No, not yet, as that Russian guy is a real scam artist, he set up an elusive system that hypnotizes more and more people everyday. I see tens of referral links to the website everyday on many FB groups, so people are still coming in and the newcomers are paying the early ones. I think that search engines, FB, twitter and LinkedIn should stop indexing such websites. For heaven's sake, I see freelance workers, who work on online sweatshops for 1-2 BTC per month, inject money into that system and market it heavily hoping to get rich quickly, so what I am seeing is that that guy is relying mainly on low-middle class individuals, mainly from South East Asia, who market his Ponzi for free, lured by the dream of "easy wealth" however, the bitter reality is that there is nothing such as a "free lunch" and there has never been one, I wish people could ever understand this!!
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:01:46
You are welcome. Really, Google should stop indexing such scams too

I don't want to seem suspicious or so, but how do we know for sure that the money is really going to the needy? I was optimistic regarding Changetip around a year ago and I used it to tip writers who wrote great pieces, when I was the editor-in-chief at a bitcoin news website, and it worked great, but ever since they increased their service fees and put limits on withdrawals, I stopped using them; this is just a personal opinion.
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:44:27
I don't have evidence apart from the Alexa ranking of the website which is relatively high along with the big number of backlinks it receives from social media. Social media are helping this guy hypnotize more victims everyday.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:49:01
Wow, that's cool. Thanks for sharing. Really, I believe that, despite a few schizophrenic policies, the USA is the most welcoming country to bitcoin.

Haruaki Osamu, one of the writers on BNC, have had the founder on his FB friend list for a while, so he captured his update; otherwise, other people are still flooding social media and FB pages with ads about MMM with their referral links. The domain name he is using, a free domain name, shows that he is about to take all those bitcoins and fly to the Bahamas :)

Sorry to hear about that. I can interview you to write an article about your experience with Cryptsy and publish it on my bitcoin news site, if you accept to present evidence of your claims. If we can show evidence and spread the word out, we can help prevent others from falling for them.

@_date: 2015-01-25 22:34:40
I am really surprised how people are annoyed when I post a link about "Bitcoin analysis" in the Bitcoin subreddit, claiming that it isn't related. I am beginning to feel that there is something personal against me specifically. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:02:50
Great. Let's keep in touch. Frankly, I don't mind spending more than I lost to Cryptsy (less than 0.4 BTC) to take positive action towards BigVern, if all those who have funds stuck at Cryptsy could get together.

Frankly, the 21 Inc is a big screw-up business model that considers the "target audience" to be "naïve". I was asked to write a review about it around 3 months ago and given only a manual that seemed to be written by someone who knows almost nothing about bitcoin or cryptography in general, so I turned down the offer. I just remember a phrase on that manual that made me LMAO "Build bitcoin applications on the 21 PC and then use the blockchain to market and sell your digital products". Around 6 weeks ago, a friend of mine in Japan, told me that he could download the 21 software libraries and run them on his Raspberry, lol

There are ways to record data on the blockchain; I just didn't try any of them except for attaching a message to the transaction
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:24:08
I agree, but it shows that still most users can't run and maintain a desktop wallet. From my personal experience, I knew several online entrepreneurs who had between 500-1000 BTC and only used online wallets because they weren't able to understand and use desktop wallets, private keys, encryption, back-up and other basic security concepts.

I rarely engage in conversations on reddit any more, just to reduce the incidence of getting my blood pressure shooting, and having to deal again with mercury spillages from broken sphygmomanometers :) , so I mostly just go through shared content as a silent observer. 
I would like to point out the fact that I was just presenting the study in a concise manner; I didn't criticize it, or critically appraise it, so I am just presenting the data in the paper without any intended prejudice. 
Most people who use bitcoin will approach an exchange to buy it. I have been around for too long, and you might be surprised to know that most people who own bitcoins don't know where their private and public keys are. Even more, in many cases, they might not even be interested to bother themselves with such technical jargon, in their opinion!
My educational background is even much more irrelevant than what you have guessed. I hold an M.D. in Pediatrics. 
Thanks for stopping by.

I have a few altcoins worth around 1 BTC on cryptsy. I have just seen this. I initiated a withdrawal now of a small amount of BTC as a test and the withdrawal request was confirmed and I am awaiting to see if it will be added to me BTC account.
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:34:08
Yes, agreed. We mentioned to use bitcoin wallets with small amounts of BTC for coding experiments in the "introduction to BTC programming" 
@_date: 2016-01-11 11:56:26
No, you are wrong. According to the charts, every major decline in SSEN was followed by a semi-logarithmic rise in BTCCNY. If the pattern continues on, BTCCNY will rise even more than it did since August, 2015, because there were 2 major declines; last Thursday's and today's.

Saving the title only wouldn't be enough, cos they can bypass that by rewriting, but what service do you recommend to save a title or an idea to the blockchain? Do you mean to attach it as a message to minor transaction?
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:47:36
I just chose not to mention any names about any publication at the beginning of the thread.

@_date: 2018-07-20 20:49:34
I have shared this link just to show you how ignorant some prominent billionaires are. Bitcoin's value lies in the security of the network. The hash power of miners from all over the world who are securing the network. Its value lies in the network of decentralized nodes that are securing a currency that is practically impossible to hack, while all forms of fiat online financial systems, including CCs, payment processors, online banking systems, have poor security and there are thousands of incidents of security breaches causing losses of billions of dollars. Bitcoin has real value, yet fiat is worth nothing; just paper with ink that is soaked in the sweat of poorly paid workers all over the world, and the blood of innocent victims killed by the governments behind the world's biggest central banks.

Yes, and I can't live without being trolled by my great friends here at r/bitcoin,but I am not surprised, because all writers get trolled here too and only posts with trivial content such as a post with an irrlevant subject, a joke, a day dream narration about bitcoin...etc, get upvoted.

@_date: 2015-11-28 15:09:45
Study candlestick charts, some statistics and a bit of calculus and you will definitely change your mind. Human behavior in a free market and human "greed" yields repeated market patterns that technical and fundamental analyses can foresee.

Another conspiracy theory "Tamer owns NewsBTC and hides in the wings". At least, this is more rational than the theory of that guy who accuses me of inventing the blockchain, or at least help spread BTC's HYIP in the early days by massive tipping. Really, I like the richness of your imagination guys. i don't own NewsbTC check the WHo is information, MR "blogosphere expert"

Well I wouldn't pay my bitcoins for such suspicious subreddits, even if it was for a good cause.

Wow, I am scared that your list will destroy my career. Please, how can I fix this? I have a lot of open mouths to feed, have mercy

It is a great idea that I would love to support. Good luck Dan on this!

Instead of reading the first phrase of the comment and "passing", I have now read it all. Same result "Just bla bla bla that "technical analysis" doesn't exist"
(By the way: Aren't these the same free markets that involve varying degrees of traders' behavior, so that after 24 hours the shape of the charts change and "TRIANGLES CHOO CHOO WHATEVER" mutate into other shapes that can signal a change in a previously predicted trend?)
Ufff, I should have passed in the first place.

Thanks. 
The idea is users should have been warned about this prior to the server downtime.
Just when the markets started to recover, we get this unanticipated server downtime :(

It is against the rules to ask users to upvote or downvote any post.
I won't respond to your misbehavior.
I will just leave you eat your heart out breaking the rules.
