yes, but they all use bitpay, or orther 3rd party services. actually i have not found anything without 3rd party.

Because there is no possibility for email it should be build from scratch. All systems I know are based on emailing customers and admins. But I do have relevant parts of it available in PHP. So whatever works out best. Main problem I see is, everybody is talking Bitcoins, but there is no real solution without 3rd party.

I agree with you, but I do think there are a few huge steps o bypass before ordinary people will enter crypto currencies.
- non techies wants to have a secure buy/sell possibility. to build up trust. businesses wants to be sure to be able to sell Bitcoins as they come in from customers. Then more and more will accept Bitcoins. If you can buy milk, food and gasoline for Bitcoins, nobody wants to sell them for FIAT. They will simply use it. But at the moment this is the biggest mountain to climb over.
- non techies must have an easy to handle wallet for their daily usage. They dont understand the underlaying technology and in the actual world everything must  be cool, fast and very easy. If they don't understand it immediately, they throw it away. Nobody anymore wants to learn something.  Looks like we have to accept this.
- non techies must have this click-and-transfered feeling. e.g. transactions must be confirmed within a max of 15 seconds. watch yourself in the supermarket. you enter your credit card and it should be done in less then 15 seconds. :-) At the moment we are to slow for the masses.
But agreed, great chances are there and this is only the beginning of a long path.

Thats what I think too. Especially where Bitcoins sould take out the 3rd party. Its again running into centraliced services for e-commerce.

I already saw this, bus as far as I have checked it, this is kinda 3rd party.

ah, no, no exchange :-) it should be a shopping cart for digital goods.should be a simple script to sell e.g. videos against bitcoins with automaticly enabling the download if the payment is received.

if you operate an own exchange you always have the risk of volatile exchange rate and you need volume to be able to buy/sell in a profitable way. worst case to many people want to sell Bitcoins against FIAT and you sit on a huge amount of Bitcoins, unable to sell them against FIAT yourself. So youn will reach the point where all of your FIAT is gone and People cant sell anymore over your exchange. You finally will get bad ratings and your Exchange is, where some in the past already ended.

as I wrote in  above, I do agree with you. I better should have written "doesnt make sense FOR ME to enter here" 
For sure, the secure buy/sell possibility opens chances for ne exchanges. But I also think something like localbitcoin was a good idea and something like this would have a chance to build up trust. This is kinda marketplace and not really an exchange. 
Exchange itself is IMHO still kinda high risk business.
