That is because every single one of them uses BTC as the backbone.   Saying BTC is unusable, dead, run for the exits, doesn't help the market at all.    This is the reserve currency we are talking about.  
Do a hit and run on it, and every other crypto holder is trembling.

I just got into bitcoin, so I am just trying to understand some of the concepts.  I have been reading that it was 20% premined and that the big ASIC miners had a huge advantage in the transition.  Also just figured out that I am owed some coin based on my balance, so thank you for that... I did not know that.   So I am currently looking into how to recover that.   So upvoting for teaching me something good.

just find your private key and do a sweep using coinomi from google play store on your android device.  The trick is to use the private key for ALL addresses that sent in money.
So if you got it from 3 sources, use all three private keys from those sources.
I was trying to find the overall address of my account, but couldnt ever get anytihng with just any address.... once i did sweeps with private keys for addresses that sent me the money into my wallet, I was able to recover all my coins... this may require entering multiple keys for some if there were unique addresses used for each transaction.
Also clear your wallet... just to be safe, before you start playing with private keys.   Don't ever post your private keys publicly.

I was able to send my balance from the Core wallet to the Segwit wallet just fine.  So it seems to recieve just fine, I would imagine sending also works this way.  I doubt I got the benefit of the fee and speed this way.
However, it is supposed to be much faster if you send to and recieve from a SEGWIT to SEGWIT wallet and the fees are much much smaller.     
So if more of us implement this, the sooner we will reap the benefits of the fork. 
We should also request the exchanges to upgrade to SEGWIT as it will increase transfers and lower fees.  Some of them already have, and many users favour those exchanges for that reason. 
EDIT:   I remember reading a post on here that said that if ALL users were to implement SEGWIT not only would the network be able to handle all of the BTC transactions but also the BCH transactions that occurred independently, meaning that if there was no fork all the demands would have been met by SEGWIT with room to spare. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:01:49
Just wanted to thank you.  I had some bitcoins on an old wallet, that i never touched and I just did a sweep of bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold pre fork and I just got 6K for Christmas.   I had no idea I was eligible for this, till you sent your response.     Thank you.

What bothers me even more is that the folks that were the most stoic and held their coins through some of the worst moments historically were the ones that Roger was out to fuck over.
These are our elite hodlers.  The last line, the guys that do not get rattled by the size of the opposing force.
....and Roger wanted to reward them by fucking them financially as hard as possible for doing what they do best, hodl.   These are the folks that made bitcoin and his crappy shit coin possible.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:39:32
How can they even enforce this?   When most of the corporations are holding billions offshore?   It's not hard to pick exchanges that are run off shore that the GOP can not tax. 
This is just fear mongering.   All this will do is collapse US based exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:37:10
Not everyone got to premine 20%, of course he is telling you to put your hard earned cash into a premined coin.   He is an insider, that is what they do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:27
Well what did he think he was going to do to the market, when he started to bash the CURRENCY that was its backbone?   Saying things like its unusable, its dead, run for the exits, wow.... the bashing is warranted as fuck.   Everyone just realized how a drop in BTC revalues the entire Crypto Market.
You can't start butchering cows infront of the the entire flock and not expect everyone of them to panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:15:24
Thank you, I had a good feeling sweep over me when I saw the transaction get posted on the wallet.  
I know that Bitcoin is making it backwards compatible for everyone, but I think the community is failing in getting people to adopt SEGWIT technology, because many folks dont know about it or are too lazy to understand that their current implementation is legacy.
 
I feel the user experience will improve if we point out to people that they can do their small part RIGHT NOW to make the bitcoin friendlier by using the faster and cheaper protocol that is currently available to all (SEGWIT).

That I am having a hard time selling some of my BTC to buy some ALT coins that are rising.   I chose against it because we need to HODL right now and cut this turd lose and his shitcoin.

Doubt they are bigger than market forces... but we certainly caught him red handed being a dick to the community in order to pump his own coin.
Don't think he is the sole reason for the correction, it would of happened anyway, even if it meant BTC would not go up for a month or so... but I can see how his actions could of forced the correction early.
This guy should not be representing the community in any way, just his stupid coin, and there should be a giant asterix below his name every time he speaks to inform viewers of his obvious bias and stake in BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:05:57

I like how the insider said he had lunch with them and they are not worried about insolvency.  Of course not, they already topped off their secret wallets.  Money worries will not be a problem if you've been dipping in it. 
When you know you are doing fractional reserve, and you know there is no chance of getting back to sq1, whats the difference of being short 500,000 bitcoins or being short 900,000. 
These guys are making out like bandits....

If you are talking about every person in the world, then, these transactions are not going to be stored in someones home.   At that point this currency would be so viable, that companies would be beating themselves up to have a server that is accessible by the public to see the block chain, much like web Credit Scores are cutting each others throats.   If you can get that sort of traffic, you can sell ads and other services.

Right.  The 850K are just inflated internal Mt.Gox numbers to keep users happy and from catching on.  The bitcoin was never really there.  
However, the users did trade gox their fiat and other ctyptos for that html balance.   So the place may still have a liability of 850K bitcoins.   For instance, MK could have just used fractional reserve withdrawl habbits, knowing not everyone will want to withdraw their bitcoin, and he may buy it when its cheaper.   Notice this all happend when bitcoin hit 1000, at that point the wheels came off, doubt he could continue the ponzi when satisfying each btc withdrawl would of meant buying btc

Really?  You really think the more money you have the smaller your ROI becomes?   Money makes money.
Buffet only goes for 20% because he is a calculated risk taker, that means he does not shoot for the moon.  No need to when you are as wealthy as him.    
Other investors take greater chances.  The amount of money has nothing to do with it.

He fleeced the public, and the banks and regulators are clapping because it serves their agenda... they wont do anything about it the banks want scampers like this to plague bitcoin and its exchanges.

You did not understand that all I was talking was about the underlying technology.  Not bitcoin software itself.
The solution to the double spend problem with this algorithm is applicable to a lot of other documents that also could be made internet ready and digitally transferable.  From ownership of vehicles, to stocks, to controlling interest in corporations.   The underlying principle of bitcoin is what has me fascinated.
The fact that you are still entering horrible software keys, instead of this technology, puzzles me... it shows that there are still software developers that have not understood the ramifications of this technology. 
Even if bitcoin fails, this tech has incredible applications.

If governments held bitcoin as a reserve, they ALL would have been stronger.  They realize that (as those municipalities in the world that invested in this are reaping huge rewards
) and by paying your taxes is just a way of them buying it themselves.
Bitcoin will grow, and as long as it has fit has value, just like any currency.  Except this one is global!!!   Even this crash has grown the currency, more people see it, more people check it... and the truth is not a single coin has been manipulated since the inception of the system!!!

If he is asking reddit where he can short bitcoin, he probably is doing it so that he can spread FUD.   Serious, investors, wouldn't be talking about their intentions on a public forum, it seems to me OP cares more about yelling his speculation, rather than setting up a proper short.
He might have already shorted bitcoin, and its not going the way he wants so he is hoping his fud helps him by getting some flip floppers to sell or short with him.
