I bought it last night as it was on my to-do list  and checked before I went to bed and saw it was  and I had to double check because I thought it was a mistake. Sold and made a couple thousand in a few hours so that was nice.

Not gambling, but investing in a casino bank roll. Big difference.

They are fine if it's lost, they would rather diversify. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:01:34
Nope its long gone
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:48:21
I did believe it or not. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:16:38
Can you show me where I went wrong?
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:59:06
Where’d I go wrong?

Met him last week in his offices at San Mateo. We were talking about Bitcoin when he casually mentioned that he thinks BTC will stabilize around $500k. It was hilarious to see everyone in the group jaw’s drop in the room.

Problem solved thank you sir!

The hash rate of mining bitcoin (or difficultly) changes every 2 weeks depending on how many people are mining it. 
So if in the period of 2 weeks a ton of people jump on and start mining the algorithm can’t readjust for 2 weeks. In the long run this doesn’t matter much, but it is partially the reason why we say “approximate” when estimating block times.

Actually, I do not fall into that category 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:37:11
Would be interested to hear

Great point, I have read about Walmart researching food chains.

Maybe he is willing to lose all his money only he can be the judge of that

Smart contracts are a big one. No longer a need for a  realtor when buying a house. However smart contracts and tokens to hand in hand in the fact you can’t send a wire transfer to a smart contract you need to send tokens. 
Met a company that was using Blockchain to create a standard health database in Africa because people are dying because transferring health records is not common practice and when they go to a new hospital they cannot treat them correctly.   
Met another company that is using smart contracts for brokering energy in Texas. 
You are correct though it needs to be exciting for college students.

Ah, I see what you mean, poor grammar. I meant 107 years after that :-)

Ok so that is a 1 day S2F calculation   
How does a 365 S2F calculation with the sloping line work [here](
The equation I see is **S2F^3.25 * 0.19** Is this also regression analysis?

Clicked on his profile, it looks like he was last on in 2017 however he died in 2014. Is there a known resin for this? His wife maybe?
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:10:49
Could just be a Ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:55:47
Buy and forget about it. If I were you I'd stretch a little more see if you could do 300,500 maybe 
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:32:42
Put your BTC through a tumbler
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:48:00
I can't answer that. Haven't had it long enough to update anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:56:00
Go poke around bittrex or kraken and read up on technical trading. A lot more money to be made while bitcoin slowly increases. You made 10% off of BTC I made total 67% in trades today. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:04:55
Could different state regulations (say NY) apply to a company based in a BTC friendly state that has few regulations if the company is doing business with a customer based out of NY?

Look up in this search bar how to gain your BCH. Sell it and take the quick cash on that. Hold your BTC
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:47:10
Very important ^

Wire transfer to coinbase 250k limit. Gets in one business day. Transfer to Jaxx. Place buy order. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:41:45
Yup it works great 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:14:17
For those of you wondering where I bought it. It is gold leafed but other than that not much 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:37:44
Just for 1 customer interview I bought a Harley on Craig’s and reluctantly had to liquidate some of my cryptos to pay for it. I just saw a Harley dealership in California is offering selling their bikes for cryptos. If I could have bought one and had it shipped to me I would have done that without a blink of an eye
I don’t know if it’s possible as I know margins are low in the car industry, but if you could manage to sell cars with say maybe discount maybe 5%, market that to the right places, and not liquidate that BTC back into USD you’d be a very very wealthy man in a 5 years.  
However like I said I know margins are bad in the car industry.

Yes Kraken will give you coins after the fork from what I’ve been reading. But just a pro tip get your coins into a wallet where you own the private keys :-)
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:00:21
Does libertyx even have many stores these days? Saw they just dipped in stores I thought 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:24:08
That’s cool! Whatcha pitchin?
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:51:51
“Yes but I’ll sell for $500”
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:56:06
Anything. Here, forums, billboards in large cities like Dallas or L.A. I would not be surprised if you caught the attention of the media locally or nationally soon and then you have free advertising :-)
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:01:43
If a customer can purchase a car from you and get it shipped to them or another dealer near them. Yes. You would increase sales significantly 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:43:42
I don’t know. I never use Blockchain.info due to the fact that I don’t own the coins if I store them on that exchange 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:21:40
It’d make my day if you could recovery these coins :-0
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:23:05
Yes go on Amazon an order a nano s and order 1 day shipping and keep that stuff safe in cold storage 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:31:14
Excited because I get to fly out and meet him in February!
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:15:39
So excited because I get to sit down and talk to him in February!
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:47:37
Couldn’t have said it better
