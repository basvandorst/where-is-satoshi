If you have $1000 to spend, I'd recommend you buy Litecoin instead. A bigger percentage means more profit. And yes, I do recommend you forget about it for a few years.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:15:24
I didn't say that. And you didn't say anything about it either in the original post. How can we just take your advice and avoid an exchange when we don't even know what they suspended you for?
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:52:23
Agreed. Especially since Coinbase is the most trustworthy exchange right now. OP, please deliver. What did you do to piss them off?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:19:06
Yup! Tesla Model 3 = my moon.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:31:04
Should rearrange it so Litecoin is 2nd on the list.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:17:03
GDAX will never verify me unless they discontinue their stupid "Public records" check as a method of verification.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:03:11
Because LTC is the 2nd best and simply because I think it deserves that spot. lol
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:04:22
8% per year is NOT good. wtf. If you invested 10k, that's only 800 bucks for a whole year.

Thank you. I'm asking because that's exactly what I did. I bought $200 worth of bitcoin and took $180 out to buy litecoin, leaving about $160 left in bitcoin. I've never paid taxes before in my life (never had a job) so I was just curious. Your answer was very helpful; thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:22:46
That's very clever.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:07:13
Drop one off in Kansas City, MO and I'll spend all month searching. I'm curious to see how this pans out.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:13:29
No I couldn't have. Because I've never had a job, I have no public records for them to verify.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:11:51
Unfortunately, I had to sell the bitcoin for cash before buying litecoin. I use CoinBase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:24:30
By the time it hits a million, I'll only have 20k...
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:39:13
Or just not tell anyone so they wouldn't know in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:34:46
I hear a lot of hardware wallets but what about paper wallet? Anyone recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:01:02
And what if they're unable to verify you based on public records?
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:06:48
I NEEEEEEED IT
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:06:31
When you created your CoinBase account on your phone, they gave you 12 random generated words. Example: "Potato, car, cheese, door, tornado, etc..." Input that into any device and your account should be restored. I've never done it myself since I haven't switched phones since creating my account a few weeks ago but I'm sure that's what I read during my account creation.

Another term I see often is "wall".
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:49:05
This one's a little trivial but have you thought of funding companies like Solar City or Tesla? They're trying to elimitnate the use of nonrenewable energy. The future is bright once they achieve their goal.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:26:55
and sporks... criminals use sporks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:55:36
Do you recommend paper wallet such as bitaddress.org?
EDIT: com to org.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:52:04
I'm new. I just made my 1st purchase on CoinBase today. Is there a better option? What's the BEST option for someone in USA?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:30:22
I thought coinbase disabled the ability to screenshot. On android at least.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:07
Not as bad as when you think the dip is over so you buy at 10,700 just to wake up to it going down to 9,500 again.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:07:53
What hardware are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:23
damn it. I dumped all my money at 10,200 thinking it would start going back up. Then it drops back to 9,700. I just lost a chunk of a percent. I'm just hoping the Big Bang Theory episode will revive these numbers tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:40:34
I've never dealt with bitcoins before. Anyone wanna link me to a video or article to get me caught?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:40:51
Damn it! I've been wanting to buy bitcoin since it was in the 7000's but my bank is taking so long to verify my coinbase account. I'm losing on so much money.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:52:26
Just did the math... If it reaches 25k, I'll only have 24 bucks ._.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:52:37
Thanks! Time to get rich. That's how it works, right?
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:08:34
Some 3rd party apps don't support UI scaling so the icons are always a certain number of pixels wide. I assume you probably have a 4K monitor which makes all the icons super small. There's nothing you can do about it unless the developer releases an update to support scaling. You could lower the resolution down to 1080p but that's just a waste of a nice high res monitor.

I guess he means non-geeks or less tech savvy people? Silicon Valley is my favorite show of all time. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The point of it was to make Gilfoyle appear inconsiderate and a non-ideal worker which made Rochard mad and made it easier for him to throw Gilfoyle under the bus about the whole fridge ordeal.
