Well, not exactly... Somebody who could afford more than a half of the mining power could shut down BitCoin. I'm no mathematician, but I think Apple is one of the few players that can afford it (off course, that would be an extremely stupid and gigantic waste of money for them: nothing that they'll probably even think about).

Which was not part of the social contract.
The message I was replying to sounded like "they can do what they want: they're the government and they're doing it for greater good - of course they have more power, that's the social contract". No, it is not. There are things which not even the government is allowed to do: the fact that they do it anyway is reprehensible.

I shouldn't leave the door of my car open but, if I do, it is not an excuse to steal it nor did I "deserve" that. It is still illegal to steal my car, no matter how stupid I am.
We have an entire over-structure of entities, which we call "society", that are supposed to put us above the natural selection through the use of justice and the monopoly of violence. Stupidity is not contemplated as a sufficient reason to put you out of this system.

Actually, computer systems are based upon 1's and 0's: this does not contradict the fact that they are indeed complex. If you can't explain it in english (or in any other language), you won't ever be able to translate it into software: thus, a solution which cannot be expressed is, from the point of view of a developer, useless. The english language doesn't limit the possibility of describing complex systems.


That's because the definitions of the terms you use ARE you answer (since I can't read your mind). If the definitions of those terms are unclear and/or don't provide any valid solution then it is not an answer.


If by verifying this computer time you require computationally intensive tasks to be executed (like in BTC/altcoin mining) then this requires an expense from the user (thus, making the market no longer "fee less"). I'm not saying that a fee based solution would be bad: most of the centralized dark net markets works this way (they require a fee to be paid by the vendor at registration). I was just trying to imagine if a fee less alternative is even conceptually possible.
If you can somehow verify computer time without computationally intensive tasks, then you must also verify that the vendor is not running 100.000.000 instances of such software. If, for example, a user earns a "trusted" status after 1 month of activity, he could easily send all of his 100.000.000 instances to buy from him and leave positive feedbacks 1 month after his registration. All of these 100.000.000 buyers will have the "trusted" status after 1 month, with the result that a scammer now has 100.000.000 fake profiles to leave feedbacks with.

Transaction fees were the last of my concerns when posting. Please think again about telling your government about the fact that you have to move 1 million USD. Get 1 million USD in cash, go to your EU bank, and drop them over the desk telling you want to deposit them. Do that. Then think again...

"Hello, this is your bank. We just saw you sent 50k€ and we are now terminating your account because we believe this transaction is money laundering. You can't do anything about it. Goodbye!".

And rich people want poor people to do the things which will allow them to be richer. Now, it's the poor VS the rich: open a history book (or look around you). Can you predict who will win? :-)
Btw, I never told this was a good selling point. "Disruptive" and "enabler" are the only judgments I gave to my theory of possible adoption. OP told dollars works fine for him, without mentioning where they come from and how much he has. If these were 100.000 dollars from illegal drugs trafficking, they probably wouldn't "work just fine" and a widespread adoption of bitcoin might enable him to move his money with less restrictions.

you can avoid taxes if you keep your money in a fiscal paradise. Keeping your money in a fiscal paradise prevents you from spending it. Hence, giving people the ability to move their money will make easier to avoid taxes.

Bitcoin has the potential to be for the economy what the internet has been for data. The big difference here is that data size is not necessarily related with its contents or value. A few lines of text can change the life of many people while a 5 gigabyte drive may contain only my vacation photos. The same doesn't hold true for money: money has only a quantitative value, not a qualitative one. The current economic system fills this hole but gives for granted things like physical distance, banks and money traceability. It is probably only a matter of time before these limits will break (I personally see it as something inevitable): we can only speculate on the effects this will have and our judgments are clearely biased by the fact that we've always been living inside these limits.

Which is not necessarily a good thing. If a global government does something stupid, we're all fucked.
I remember reading (might be in [this book]( that China lost any possibility of technological development (back at one point of its history) just because of a central unified government. A stupid emperor decided to burn all the books of the nation: done. That couldn't possibly be done in Europe: that was one of the many reasons (others are explained in that book) why europeans have conquered pretty much all of the planet. China had enormous problems of technological development, because of a central government being afraid of it. If, say, France or Italy had something similar (a government afraid of a new technology) they could either adopt that technology or die (because surrounding countries would adopt such technology and gain economical/political/military advantage). The lack of technological competition was a huge problem, for 2 millennia, in the history of China, up until [1911 when the empire felt](
A central government alone is only dangerous. What we really need is something that prevents the government from doing something stupid, which is not only a practical problem but a philosophical one (how can you arbitrarily decide what is wrong and good, above of time and space? How can we be sure we're enforcing the "right thing"?). When we will solve this problem (can it be solved?) maybe we wouldn't even need a government anymore...
p.s: I'm not an historian. I'm just an ignorant prick, so please check what I'm saying.

@_date: 2014-07-07 21:36:59
That if you work for a bank in a fiscal paradise you either have to kick your EU clients away or let them phone to their government giving away the entire history of their accounts. While some countries haven't adopted these measures yet, the prospect of Switzerland closing similar deals with the remaining countries is becoming increasingly likely.
I wish I could find the article explaining all this I've read some days ago. Basically, someone theorize the only reason rich people are exchanging assets through legal channels is because (as of today) it provides much more advantage. The only reason why people don't use "dirty" money is because moving it far away is really dangerous. In a legal market, you pay the taxes/fees but you can potentially make commerce with the whole planet with a (relatively) small expense.
If bitcoin will become widespread and accepted as, for example, gold this might enable people with tons of dirty money to move them freely. This has never happened before.

Nope. Blockchain.info owns a backup copy of your wallet but it is AES encrypted with a pass phrase only you know. You still are the only person who owns the private keys.
Off course, they could change this tomorrow and insert some malicious script mailing them your pass key without you noticing but, right now, if they wanted to access my private keys they would not be able to. They only have an encrypted copy.

Well, I can be violent against a person who enter a school with 2 guns and starts shooting or/and I can be violent with a guy who use too much electricity. There are, at least in theory, different way I can channel violence and not all of these are "bad" (if we agree on what's good and what's bad).
If you create an entire sub-system (i.e. Law enforcement) dedicated to distribute this violence, since it is made of human beings it will probably bring violence also where it doesn't belong. That doesn't mean that a system where this violence is controlled is impossible, nor that we shouldn't do whatever is possible to actualize such a system.
For instance, a system which declare a war against the people who consume drugs (even if they call it with the misleading name of "war on drugs") is a system deemed to use violence against non-violence. It is completelly natural for a system like this to bust into your house and seize everything you have, especially if this war has more priority that the law.

A scam is not necessarily direct theft of a wallet private keys. If I buy a book from a website and it is not shipped to me I got scammed. Mt.Gox was a scam. Butterfly labs was a scam. Every breach of a contract involving the payment of Bitcoins in exchange of a good/service may be defined a scam.
The purpose of BTC has nothing to do with preventing scams. I personally saw the BTC address of a scammer selling fake ASICs: it received more than 50k BTC.
So, no: securing your wallet(s) is a necessary but NOT sufficient step to prevent being scammed.

I'm not interested into buying Bitcoin per se, as I'm not an investor. I just use it as a currency wherever I can. When I need to buy it, I can already do that through an exchange.
I'm also not interested into buying merchandise since I don't live in the US and the credit can only be used on amazon.com. I live in Europe and I'd have to pay huge shipping prices and highly inflated customs rates.

Sell it? I don't simply sell BitCoins... I gift them.
I gift them to the people I love, to those close to me. If every holder were to do that, even with a ridiculously low number (say 1$ or 5$ if you're rich) the popularity would explode.
Gift bitcoins to your girlfriends, friends, sons, husbands, neighbors... Tell them you're giving them real money, show them where and how they can spend or hold them.
This is the only way to spread Bitcoin.
The other being a sudden evolution of the masses and elimination of ignorance. Technology alone won't bring that: we're no longer in the era where simply having a computer or an Internet connection made you smarter. Technology and the Internet are slowly becoming dumber, easier, more accessible to complete idiots but less explorable by hackers.
