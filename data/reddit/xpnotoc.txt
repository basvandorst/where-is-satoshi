Well great, I ordered two Trezors two days ago and I see they've already shipped ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:57:02
off by 3 days ;)

Currently the blockchain is around 160Gb. That's alright in my harddrive. But say they increase block size 4x or 8x. Suddenly you're dealing with 1Tb+. So the fear is that normal users are going to be pushed out and only big actors (server farms etc) can run nodes. Which means a risk of decreased decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:53:45
But I think there are drawbacks to running a pruned node. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:42:07
Exactly, I don't get anything showing up in Windows Update. I believe the fix won't be out for another week or so ?  
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:05:39
By the way, does Trezor support segwit addresses? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:51:13
Yes, with the Petro. The Swedish coin isn't a cryptocurrency, it's a digital coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:56:11
Seems I was off by 3 days... Major dip happening right now!

They are obviously told what to say from their puppeteers, nobody is that stupid.

I left Coinbase this summer and moved to Kraken. Kraken has its issues when placing orders for sure, but at least it's not Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:22:05
Today I even got a 525 !

you could go to coinmarketcap and look at the markets, you can see which exchanges and importantly which currencies are trading and which % of the volume they constitute

My Bitcoins are in my full bitcoin core node. How can I "access" (sell) my BCH ??
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:38:18

Can someone explain what he means by "be sure you're upgraded to be safe"? Does he mean full nodes? what is unsafe about running the bitcoin core (0.14.2)? thanks
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:04:34
So guys, do I now need to run a certain Bitcoim Core Node version? or is the 0.14.2 ok? Should switch to UASF/Bip148? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:52
3 hours later the BCH price keeps getting pumped and BTC is dropping below 5k EUR... It would seem this scam attack isn't going to go over easily gents... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:10:03
hmmm, i haven't had issues before.. are you also using 2fa for your orders? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:43:24
It's now OVER 9000 (EURO) :D
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:09:53
Kraken. Much lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:28:44
This is an attack on bitcoin, an attack on all of us.

PSA: Remove 2FA for new orders and choose skip confirmations. That helped my orders to go through when before I'd need to try at least 10 times.. 
(for added security, choose 2FA for Logins).

Apparently BitFinex now says that new accounts will "unlikely" be able to trade for USD or USDT..
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:49:38
Yes, in fact this should be good for bitcoin since it may shrink the altcoin market cap to the advantage of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:17:19
Well, I'm going on a trip to the US so it's not like I can avoid that. Just wondering whether they have the right to make me log in to my accounts and/or can just impound my laptop just like that.

you see two fruit stands in a market. one sells oranges for $2/lb, the other for $1.69/lb. which one is more accurate? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:18:37
^ same here ;) 
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:15:21
Lol, not at all. It's just logic plain and simple. Having throwaway accounts means people can't go back to your profile history and see who you "really are". Therefore your comments aren't reliable. Why don't you post with your real account instead? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:05:57
they buy into BTC before the forks so they can get free fork-coin 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:46:16
We're just saying that your opinion isn't reliable because of the obvious new account. And no, 10% down and then 6% up is NOT a crash. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:54:30
I'd wear that with pride ;)

Good write-up, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:16:00
Could somebody point me to a good FAQ about how to sell my BCH without risking my BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:33:46
 what drop? you mean the flash sale of BTC? :D
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:50:32
OP you must read this, then remove your btc from coinbase: 
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:52:02
actually from 1k to 5k in one year and 5 to 25 in 5 years is everything but exponential.. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:27:39
well thank God they also have the bielorussian ruble in there
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:53:10

Full node reporting for duty since June 2017
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:35:57
No, not at all. Value is set by the market. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:50:23
Lol what the heck? Just read Gemini doing the same thing and people are saying that 'wow, even Coinbase handles this better'.. well I guess not! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:58:37
Is not actually a 'cap', it just means what's the total value of all coins at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:30:36
You get the same amount of coins of the new chain that you have in the old chain (any fraction of coin)
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:38:24
Same here. Hard to see what BCH can offer to a market dominated by BTC and with Bitcoin Gold and B2X incoming.. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:30:40
I should have specified my situation. I am running a full Bitcoin Core node and have my BTC there. I don't own a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:19:09
so if people's nodes aren't validating these blocks... are those blocks valid? isn't that in itself a fork of some kind? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:07:09
Running 0.14.2, I think that's the latest node
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:16:02
nothing, just some electricity
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:38:08
I would certainly not mind getting a little btc for running my node :&gt;
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:36:59
so what happens if i don't upgrade to uasf bip148 enforcing node before tomorrow, and i do it the next day? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:50:57
whow that's a great response, thank you! 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:45:52
I don't know, but today is the first day I see that warning.. And yes, upgraded to 0.14.2 still shows me the same ~~error..~~ warning
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:33:18
what should one do about this? just ignore? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:44:24
I just upgraded to 0.14.2 and also see the warning... 
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:09:54
why is this good news? this proposal is a miner-driven action to bypass users altogether and will lead to a hard fork in a few months... 
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:59:43
yeah, no jinxing!
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:56:51
just press ctrl+shift+D to enter the menu bar, select Exodus&gt;Developer&gt;Prices and select EUR. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:42:05
pretty sure the BIP148 coin will be named BTC and the bitcoin unlimited version be named BTU if a fork does occur
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:06:14
there was always supposed to be 21 million coins
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:00:33
I'm just a small fish in this pond, running my full 0.14.2 node and storing my few BTC in that Bitcoin Core wallet. I guess all I need to know is:
if I install a BIP148-enforcing update to my node, and the majority of the "fish" go another way, what happens to my BTC ? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:00:05
add JP Morgan to the mix... 
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:19:57
...so then I don't really understand what's the point of "enforcing" a solution if you're anyway going to have access to both chains in case of a hard fork.. I mean, how is that "enforcing" ? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:51:00
gotcha, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:03:49
what you're saying is that if a person chose to enforce bip148 on his/her node and then later it turned out that bitcoin took "the other turn", then that person would effectively have "lost out" on getting the other coin? 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:24:15
what does FUD stand for? I see it everywhere.. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:29:23
Seems to get good reviews and is recommended by 99bitcoins, cryptocompare and others. Apparently doesn't offer multi-sig or 2FA (neither do many other SPV wallets) , but does offer HD. All in all it feels like a good option, especially since it gives you control of all your private keys AND integrates with shapeshift allowing exchanges to other altcoins (dash, golem, aurum, doge etc). Security seems good too, password and seed words and backup sent to email address. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:55:58
ha! actually serious, didn't realize it sounded like a joke.. bit of noob here
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:51:44
thank you, i appreciate your response! I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:09:26
[not sure if this question fits here, pls remove if not]
I have a question about backing up / securing private keys. Is it considered risky or dumb to 
1) export private keys in a .csv or .txt file
2) encrypt with 7-zip using AES256
3) email myself the encrypted archive?
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:31:04
kraken verifications take several days to weeks right now.. wouldn't call it hassle-free 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:47:22
User Activated Soft Fork = UASF
basically there's a possibility that the blockchain will be split into two not mutually compatible chains. I think. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:37:24
I got my BTC, ETH and LTC all in Coinbase. Is there a way to move them somewhere else or will i have to sell off my hodlings and then buy new elsewhere? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:11:34
that's where the KYC rules come in to the picture in exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken etc... They know who you are and how much crypto you have in those exchanges. Obviously if you take them out of those exchanges there shouldn't be a problem 
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:49:28
as somebody that (sadly) only entered the bitcoin arena this year, this was a very illuminating read! 
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:13:41
don't worry, there'll be more dips! 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:36:04
so basically this would apply to having the bitcoins on a full node of bitcoin core? (not upgraded to uasf/bip148). or will having the coins in a full bitcore node only give the chain that core chooses? i'm confused.. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:34:18
is this true also for people that run BIP148 enforcing nodes? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:16:48
Try Coinbase, reputable, secure and low fees
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:44:39

I heard Trezor and LedgerNanoS are unavailable for purchase until september due to extreme demand... is there another (hardware wallet) option for owners of btc/altcoins to be safe until after aug1? thanks
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:53:37
well, Coinbase is an exchange while Exodus is a hot wallet so I'm not sure they're comparable. For example one would still have to transfer the coins back to Coinbase in order to sell for usd/eur and withdraw to a bank account.. Hopefully by then it's going to be more reliable?
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:30:46
question about wallet.dat from my **encrypted** bitcoin core wallet. is it safe for me, for backup reasons, to encrypt my wallet.dat file with, say, 7-zip AES256, and upload it to my google drive, gmail or some cloud? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:14:52
Coinbase is very easy to use
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:04:25
moved everything out to exodus (fitting name tbh) a few days back, quite happy about the move
