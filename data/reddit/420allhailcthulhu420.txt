Exactly, that's why I want to move them away from coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:45:01
Yeah it doesn't work anymore but you can create a bip39 seed somewhere else and import it 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:39:29
Okay, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:16:42
Probably just coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:31:29
Where do I get a BIP39 seed from?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:34:55
So I create a seed on this website and import it in the recovery option of electrum right?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:35:40
0.0069 Drygord I bring some myself
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:03:50
Yeah that's what I thought as well, but I heard some bad stories about coinbase locking people out and it's pretty much the opposite of what btc was designed for (using it like a bank and not having control over your own coins). 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:04:37
What is a trustworthy generator?
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:50:35
They also aren't supporting SegWit adresses, so I will loose quite a bit when the fees go up again...
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:34:28
But you can only create bc1
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:02
*Tips forehead*  
Can't have a crash, if nobody can sell
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:08
If btc is 20k the buy offers will be like 20k 20.1k 20.2k and so on... Buy offers go up in price, so price will rise.  
What you said doesn't make sense, no one will buy at 20k when there is a listing at 19.8k 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:24
Yeah, I'll just hold onto my coins and maybe buy some more of it dips really hard 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:39:16
It hasn't been worth to mine btc with gpus for years, you could try to mine some altcoins and convert them into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:34
I really wonder, how many Bitcoins got lost this way, since at least 0.025 missing (and probably a whole lot more) there is no 21 million club...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:34
The Euro price is also really far behind (even on gdax), no way this is sustainable
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:43
Nobody fucking knows as the price is going insane... maybe it goes up 10 k more before it dips for 5k, maybe it dips really hard in a minute...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:32
If you really want to invest such an amount, you should be doing enough research to answer all these questions by yourself and not ask random people who might know less than you on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:59
to 18k in a few minutes
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:55:55
Have you taken the 1 million into account that Satoshi has got?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:14
Just read your first response like 5 times, if you replace "buy" with "sell" (except for the last one and the one in line 3) it actually makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:57
Okay yes, that makes sense, when they start selling a huge amount, other people may start selling as well, which drives the price down even more, so the whales can rebuy even more. That kind of market manipulation is already happening, but you really need a lot of money available to pull it of.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:56:25
Oh yes, but that probably happened to BTC as well
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:44:37
Like I said, it's not worth to mine bitcoin, they are probably mining some altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:28:59
Why litecoin and not Etherum?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:58:09
I know, but that's a 10% difference, not 1%...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:55:09
Yes, I thought so too, but they aren't... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:44:37
You should not invest more than you could afford to loose.  
It could crash any day (even though it's unlikely), just think about the possibility that it would crash and all the money you invested is gone. If it wouldn't impact you life majorly, go for it, but putting all your savings in seems really risky to me
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:36:16
You could also buy now, sell before the fork and buy after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:35:10
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:33:30
It's up 50% the last month only (and it had a considerable dip in it...) I think you can figure it out yourself
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:49:17
Like it did after china banned it?
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:54:58
Not sure if you know what the problem of a deflationary economy is...    
When "extra thing start disappering" it's gonna take a huge hit on the economy and many people that are producing/ selling these "extra things"(pretty much anything else except stuff you need for a living, nobody wants to buy luxury goods, when you can get them cheaper the next day) will be loosing their job and we are gonna slide in a new financial crisis.   
That's why banks currently try to keep the inflation at ~1% at the moment and our economy is doing really well at the moment.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:17:49
It's almost like they have no idea of economics...
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:57:38
Yeah, one meme video will debunk everything I just said... Can you prove that our economy is doing bad atm? Otherwise it's just childish...
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:36:25
Wow, you couldn't come up with a single argument in three comments...    
Are you actually gonna  say anything that is logical or at least proves your original point, why a deflationary currency should, in any way, be good or just keep making vague comments and distract from the fact you know absolutely nothing about economics?
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:06:55
There is just nobody offering it, because of the easy charge-backs
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:09:05
Dude, it's always a 50/50 chance... Either it crashes or it doesn't
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:31:40
And then we have coinbase/gdax using 191sat/byte...
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:08:03
Of course not, but it never is for every Generation... What is your point?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:31:48
Maybe they are using the same calculator like coinbase...
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:02:42
Oh wow, thanks for explaining, I feel so dumb now!
