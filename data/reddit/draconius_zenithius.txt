He even admitted he doesn't know anything about crypto. So why should he have any say in it's projections? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:01:10
Yup. Lost private keys, lost wallet passwords, deceased HODLers, typos and noob mistakes, and the list of possibilities goes on

It looks like coindesk was malfunctioning too.. it showed that bitcoin was $25, i swear, i should have taken a picture. I knew it had to be a mistake. still terrifying tho

And if someone asks you, don't tell them. If someone asked what your life savings is, would you tell them? and it's a ridiculous question. "so, what's your estimated net worth?"

i sent over 1.04 Bitcoin today, twice, and the fee was only $10 each time. Not ideal, but better than $50+ fees. Also, these transactions received several confirmations within minutes

Long story short. In 2020, the amount of Bitcoins being mined will be half. You can learn more on the Internet.

just imagine if segwit adoption starts to happen.. things should improve a lot. at least hold the fort until the lightning network becomes implemented. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:49:12
Coinbase and Blockchain.info will implement it early 2018
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:43:56
They did. you receive Bcash on January

Very well could be, but I don't think so. Probably main stream shills
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:30:01
Nice!! 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:08:41
True. But a lot of them are very old men. So hopefully they will die soon and crypto will be free.

Why wouldn't it be the first sentence for every cryptocurrency then? Just seems so out of place

Whoever say Bitcoin is going to zero is either a mentally retarded idiot, or is a deceiving liar causing FUD. Even the shittiest shit coins are still worth something.

I has nothing to do with that. It's because the Cboe Bitcoin Futures contracts expired today.

Yep that's a good way to do it. There's lots of ways to do it.. as long as you know what you're doing. What's the best software for that?

I believe Segwit was implemented. The Segwit2X implementation is supposed to happen in November. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 04:05:57
It does. I used it today. After getting no confirmations for 14 hours, i used it and then got my first confirmation within 15 minutes. 2nd confirmation happened another 5 minutes later. And it was free
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:06:05
Or at least perhaps the Bitcoin logo/ symbol on his top hat

Anyone have any suggestions? Reply to this comment

We should think of a name for mbtc. Something catchy.. It would help Bitcoin catch on. We already know what a satoshi is. 1 mbtc = 1 bit?

1 mbtc = 1 Nakamoto ? Because 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 already 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:10:47
I was stuck a few hours today too. Nothing unusual, just wait it out 
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:04:06
Since there will always be (at minimum) a rogue group supporting Bitcoin core, there will always be the true BTC. And there will likely always be demand as well.

You can also save the paper wallet image as a pdf and save it on a flash drive, encrypted external hard drive, password protected computer, etc.
