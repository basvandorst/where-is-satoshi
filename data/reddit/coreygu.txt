Ok....I haven't spent these coins...this is not fabricated...my bitcoin should be in the xw6 address....that's the last place i put them....

When i created the wallet I was offline.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:40:17
I used  another bitaddress address to test first...the transferrred the contents back to coinbase...then to the hacked address that I first listed....basically....I wanted to trade in bitcoin....all that stuff seems so excessive...not have it in some deep underground wallet

Can someone help me understand where the 1.89 bitcoins are now?
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:40:48
I downloaded bitaddress from the bitaddress.org....used it offline to generate an address that i transferred .2 bitcoin....4 months later after I saw it was secure....I moved all my coin....I am real person this is not false....my 1.9ish bitcoins ended up in an account with over 2.0 bitcoins....I have never had over 2.0 bitcoins...Can someone help me make sense of that? I am seeking help...I am longtime reddit user who doesn't post much...This is not fake... If you guys are wondering about this bitcoin crash, it probably has to do with this happening more than just to me....

I transferred the funds to this address from coinbase
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:00:30
sorry i'm not as good as  you at reddit....
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:10:04
Which would be used if a bunch of coins were stolen?
