It matters in the context of this conversation.

Thanks for settling that debate.

We know.

Stability is not a feature that comes with fiat or crypto.
Fiat currencies are not immune from volatility, many countries have experienced hyper inflation and caused their money to fluctuate like crazy. 
The current volatility with crypto is due is not to the nature of crypto, it's just a new product trying to find it's price.

but other countries can change their preferences. There was a time when the Euro was really strong and many people started preferring that over USD. However, the U.S. government is unlikely to ever accept anything other that USD for taxes, so there'll always be demand for the currency, in order to pay your taxes.

Does he buy them himself or just ask you to do it? If he buys them himself, what'd you set him up with?

This is the key to fiat having everlasting value. IRS only accepts payments in USD. You have to eventually convert if you are part of US society and earning money.

Some have normal desktop computer capacity drives, especially office printers like Xerox, and store a ton of data. There was an article a few years ago about someone buying old printers from police and hospitals. They found a ton of patient info and other private days b

Transfers are not checks. Transfers are 100% electronic while paper checks require extra processing. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:00:36


Where are you getting 6% APR on a risk free investment? 
The delay isn't so the bank can roll around in your money, it's because checks take time to clear from one bank to another. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:25:51
That's a helpful answer. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:42:51
I get your point but I have a serious question. Wouldn't people who are interested in mining likely have bitcoins to pay you with, since they're embracing bitcoin? How man transactions were paid in bitcoin VS. credit card? Wouldn't bitcoin be the preferred payment method?

Makes sense. What's the name of the service?

What if they were able to access the GPU? Would that be enough power to mine coins if they were able to get 100,000 machines mining for a few minutes a day?
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:47:26
Oh. How did people make payments before electronic transfers?
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:08:33
You only get instant use of checks if you have good credit because its a short term loan at that point. You don't have the money instantly because the check cleared, that still takes time. 
If you have bad credit then you have to wait until the check clears. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:51:08
The bank isn't making money on the float. If anything, they're losing money because they're extending the customer a credit *while* they clear the check. During the check clearing process, the bank has not received the money but, because you have good credit, they're extending a portion of the check to you in advance (aka loaning you money) while the check clears.

Mark changes to your comment as "edit" or "updated" and keep a history of the changes. Otherwise new people reading this will get confused by the replies and it'll be hard for them to follow along.

It's had to do with the frustration people feel with alternative payment methods. The issues with PayPal, Visa, MasterCard and the like are a large part of why bitcoin is popular. OP is venting some of that frustration. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:45:46


This whole post is about OP being able to buy Bitcoin now that they've got a credit card.
Idiot confirmed.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:38:14


Yeah, you are now, after getting called out for not taking into account how they'd get murdered by fees. 


Including you.


@_date: 2019-08-30 13:17:28


You're suggesting someone buy $20 worth of Bitcoin using a credit card? The fees will be brutal. 
Anyplace that accepts cards to load the account will probably take a $3 fee for processing that transaction. That's a 15% fee!
Better advice will be to save up those $20s until you get $200. That'll knock down the fees to about 3%. Still high but much more manageable.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:16:56
It's not the only option available to the general public but it's the option OP specifically intends on using. 
OP specifically said "*I can finally use my credit card online to start investing.*"

Complete nonsense. Kevin has the biggest deals in Tank.

There is never a "buy right now" moment. If you want to get into Bitcoin (or any other investment) you need to buy a little bit, over and over. 
Take your budget, break it up over 52 weeks and buy a little bit each week.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:24:43
Everyone passed on that.
Ohhh. I understand now. You're just a troll saying absurd things.

Futures allow for massive leverage.

Where would the fraud be with accepting bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-07-25 05:53:02
This is the fraud reference: if PayPal allows people to buy bitcoins, people would try to buy them using fraudulent means.
@_date: 2013-07-25 04:21:59
I didn't know OP was referring to selling bitcoin. I was referring to using bitcoin to purchase things.
Yes, I agree that selling bitcoins would definitely increase the amount of fraud.
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:54:35
But if we're talking about it from strictly a *funding* perspective, like linking my checking account with PayPal, then there shouldn't be any problems. Fund the PayPal account just like you do with a credit card or bank account.
