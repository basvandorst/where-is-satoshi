good lesson here; smart money is already in before there's news and gets out while the news is good.  
It's why you always see these posts saying "the news is so good, why is the price dropping?!!!"  That's a dumb money question.

Trying to find the 'cause' is speculative gibberish that talking heads on CNBC have programmed people to look for.  There are too many variables to act on that speculation.

Ask people like this if they would pick up a dollar bill sitting on the ground.  
If they say "no", then move on.
If they say "yes", then tell them it's a digital dollar bill.  And if he had picked it up 4 years ago it would be worth 350 dollars now.

Those transactions have no effect on price simply because of the nature of the transaction.  The exchange then sells that coin right back to the next buyer.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:22:15
My honest guess is some low-level buttcoiner type works there, saw a transaction, and decided to make you miserable.  But throwing a frivolous SAR out there is the type of thing that type of person would do.

How do offchain transactions work, and tell me if my suspicion that there's some sort of privacy violation or other scam going on here means i have a tinfoil hat.

So in real estate law a contract is not valid unless there is consideration, which always used to mean US Dollars.  Any lawyers test whether btc counts as consideration according to the IRS, Recorder's office, or courts?

When a business grows too large because it was given an unfair advantage through lobbyists, regulation and government intervention it's fine to boycott if you wish.  
But when it's natural growth in a relatively free market, it will disappear as fast as it grew if they don't do right by the market, so there's little reason to boycott.
Which one coinbase is I don't know for sure, but I think it's the 2nd.

Prices rise when buyers buy in excess of sellers selling.  By the time news is news its already baked into the price.  BTC is now a mature market with big players moving prices, and they are playing chess.  
They will buy before the news is news (buy the rumor) and sell when it hits the media.  They will short 'good' news.  They will squeeze shorts on 'bad' news.  
People should NOT look at news as a driver of prices in mature markets.
