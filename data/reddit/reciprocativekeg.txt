Dude. You didn’t even wait long enough from your coins to be available. The. You went ape shit with your bank filing cases which probably got your money returned. I swear people are so impatient 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:34:56
I’ve just ordered one but it will take around  3 months to get here since I refuse to order from eBay or amazon. Where should I keep them until then? I have full security on poloniex and since I’m based in the us they seem like the safest option. Haven’t check out Gemini but I hear they are legit too.

I dont think you understand. The big promoters were apart of the Bitconnect team. They acted like they lost a bunch when in reality they probably had plenty of time to pull out. Why you are still falling for their videos and “sadness” i have no idea
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:30:19
Who the fuck would buy with a credit card anyway. Might as well just mortgage the house again
