"You should sell your Bitcoins, Bitcoin may hit $X this year".
See what I did there?

How does this not concern you in the least? I'm not talking about losing money, but your mental health.
You have clearly lost enough money from investments/markets in the past to cause loss of sleep and "depression". You indicate that you've essentially put enough money on the line to force yourself to move back in with your mother.
A history of investment choices that have left you in a sorry state of mind, yet, you romanticise Bitcoin by using phrases such as "ready for war", "revolutionary new technology", etc. 
You are exactly the textbook investor who loses in any scenario because I doubt you will ever sell, because of greed. You've also stated that it isn't about the money, but rather, to support a movement. Anyone who says it ain't about the money I call instant bullshit, especially when what we are talking about is Crypto CURRENCY.

When's the finish line?

I smell fear.

I think this is a fantastic response. Too bad too many people let greed take over their common senses/intuition. Very hard to time the market. 
Pick a price you are happy with, collect your winnings, and enjoy life.

You guys don't learn eh. This Reddit is just a huge memefest where 90% of people don't know what they're doing

What a joke. It's a shit article because all of a sudden not every news website is sucking BTC dick? 
But when people are praising BTC I'm sure you use that to justify your poor decisions. Hope you don't lose your house!

I like how BTC is worthless unless it's tied to the US economy/dollar. It will take a very long time before it can gain it's independence (if it even survives). For something to have a value of essential 0, unless converted to an actual currency, makes me laugh.

Bullshit. I'd guess very few people invest in BTC for the reasons you mentioned above. The majority of people are greedy and wanted to ride the upside potential.
Tacking on the "invest  in the future, censorship resistance" bullshit to make them sound smarter and level headed than they actually are.
Classic buyer's remorse.

Please tell me you've got more than this if you're even attempting to invest in bitcoin. Otherwise, it really seems like an "all on black" strategy.
