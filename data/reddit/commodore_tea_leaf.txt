A big problem of shifting straight into deflation would be debt - if you exist in a system of deflation, the real value of debt is rising all the time. As I'm sure you know, a lot of businesses, governments, and individuals are fairly leveraged right now. The slow growth going on in much of the developed world at this time are believed by many to be a vast 'deleveraging,' with people and entities slowly reducing the amount of debt they have on their books so that their income/debt can rise. Inflation is very important in a situation like this because debt is nominally denominated (in most cases), so inflation reduces the real value of that debt, allowing individuals and entities to service that debt and pay down principal more easily. This is a major reason why policymakers do not like inflation - it not only can stall an economy when it provides disincentives to consumption and investment, but it also increases debt loads and slows deleveraging.
To your point on innovation - it sounds interesting to imagine no banking system in the middle of lending, investing, saving, and offering debt/equity. But be sure to consider net job/innovation creation (destruction) - how much addition innovation would occur and how much would be destroyed. Without a banking system, many individuals and businesses would be without a means of raising capital. I know that you mentioned people raising capital through apps, but from random people? They're much less qualified to make lending decisions, there would presumably be much more delinquency, then lower lending, and overall lower activity, in my opinion. Just my .02
