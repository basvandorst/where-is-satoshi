All you need are the private keys for the addresses that held the BTC at the time of the fork. If you've since moved your BTC, you don't need to anything else with it.
I then used this guide:

Couldn’t you, in theory, recreate your private keys using software that supports the same scheme as the Ledger?

After transferring all my BTC to a new wallet, I used the Bither wallet (Android) to get some coins, then send them to exchanges that support them.

This happens all the time after a sudden price explosion. My theory is that people who bought  in early and have seen a 10x or 100x return on their investment are skittish and cashing out. If I owned hundreds of coins I certainty would be.

Any idea where this sudden hash rate increase is coming from?

1) move all your BTC to a new wallet. For safety. 
2) find the private key for the address(es) that held the coins at the time of the fork. Your wallet should provide this ability. 
3) import the private keys into a wallet that supports the new coins. (Eg: Coinomi or Bither)
4) transfer them somewhere for safe keeping, or sell them on an exchange. Whatever you want!
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:55:20
The ledger uses a different seed format than Electrum. So you’d have to send the coins from Electrum to the ledger’s receiving address. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:49:05
Don’t forget there is also Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and others. It’s a little bit more involved since you need to find wallets that support them (Coinomi and Bither for example) and use exchanges that trade them (Binance and gate.io for example). 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:01:03
The best thing to do is to first move all your BTC to a new wallet. I’m not sure how this works with hardware wallets, but once your BTC is in a new address (that’s not at all related to the previous wallet) you can try and get your forked coins without worrying about losing any BTC or having nefarious software steal the private keys. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:00:19
Not sure to be honest. There are probably PC wallets that support them though.

Are there any other significant “layer 2” projects being worked on apart from Lightning? I’ve been waiting years to see Bitcoin becoming a platform for higher levels of development, but I haven’t seen much (other than Lightning).

@_date: 2018-01-22 09:00:36
I’m still learning about this, but could you leave a channel open for years? Everything I’ve seen about Lightning is that it relies on time-locked contracts to prevent bad behaviour. Does this still allow me to have a payment channel open indefinitely?

It’s a worldwide peer-to-peer network, so it’s not technically feasible for a government to block access to it.

When I did some reading and understood how the system is decentralised and how consensus is reached. There is no central, human controlled part of it. It’s open source code and a peer to peer network. 
At that point I realised it can’t be shut down. That it solves a genuine problem in computer science and that even though the solution may be imperfect, nothing like it has ever existed before and it will continue to grow as a platform.

Putting the seed phrase into a new airgapped computer, and signing transactions offline, and never connecting that computer anything (and only transferring a signed transaction in a safe way like a QR code) would be identical to using a hardware wallet. 
The difference is the hardware wallet makes doing all of that much easier. There is less chance of making a mistake or accidentally exposing the private keys etc.
In either case the best option is to generate a new list of seed words in a secure way (hardware wallet or not), store them on paper/metal and keep a watch on the wallet using the master public key. This will enable you to transfer to it using different addresses, and keep an eye on your funds without exposing any private keys.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:48:39
Now is a good time as any to get in. Nobody knows what the price will do. 
Buy a small amount (like $50 worth) on a reputable exchange, transfer it to your own wallet (preferably a hardware wallet) and make a few online purchases with it. Get familiar with it. 
Then buy more (as much as you’re willing to lose) and keep it in your wallet. Lock it away for a few years.
Don’t bother day trading and don’t keep your coins on an exchange. 
Some things to research:
-	Software wallets (like “Electrum”)
-	Hardware wallets (like “ledger nano” or “trezor”)
-	long term offline storage solutions (known as  “cold storage”)

Correct. But if you have your coins on an exchange or online wallet, you’re at their mercy to help you get them. Keep your coins stored in your own offline wallet so you have access to the private keys.

I bought at the peak of late 2013. At the time in early 2014 it looked pretty bad. But now the 2013 “bubbles” are nothing but tiny bumps in a price chart. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:51:38
If the price reaches $100k per coin then the drop from $20k to $6k will look like a dip. 
The bubbles of peaks of $100 and $1000 sure look small on a current price chart. 
This exponential growth we’re talking about. A 50-70% price crash is not new in bitcoin territory. I was there in 2013 and saw my initial investment get slaughtered. 5 years later is seems so inconsequential. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:36:10
The difference is that bitcoin’s network and code are open and can be audited by anyone. He’s talking about the integrity of the system as a whole.

In order to buy you need to find a seller and agree on a price. If $30billion wanted to buy at the current price and there was $30billion for sale at the current price...the price wouldn’t change at all. 
In reality demand would probably outstrip supply and the price shoot way up. But there’s no way of calculating what decisions all those people will make. Which exchange will they use? How much are willing to invest at which price? How much are people selling willing to sell for? Etc.

The Lightning network currently works through a threat of penalty. If you try to cheat then the other party can steal all the funds in your channel. This also means if you accidentally do the wrong thing you can be penalised. 
This new proposal makes it possible to settle disputes without penalties. It requires a change to the bitcoin protocol, but such changes are now much easier to make due to the features added in the SegWit update last year. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 10:26:40
Eltoo looks very promising. Do you expect it to eventually become the main way of using channels? As opposed to penalties.

@_date: 2014-09-13 11:39:24
Because bitcoin is a currency (and a payment network) that's native to the internet.
Buying stuff online or sending money online can be done without bitcoin...but it requires trusted third parties like banks, credit card companies, or Paypal. They charge fees, take time (days or weeks) to confirm a transfer, they can cancel or undo your payments if they want, and they all have their own rules and laws to follow.
With bitcoin...there is no third party. You send a transaction and in under an hour you have a encryption confirmed, mathematically irreversible payment.
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:03:45
Sorry if this has been asked before, but are there plans to add a contact/favorite list for addresses? I know address reuse isn't the best bitcoin practice, but since I regularly send money to a handful of addresses I currently resort to copying and pasting from an externally saved list.

I don't understand why them not rolling out NFC is being used as an anti-Apple platform and a pro-Bitcoin platform.
NFC, regardless if being used for Mastercard, Bitcoin, ApplePay or Google Wallet...is a great communication system and works great for in-person payment. It's practically space-age compared to printing QR codes on dead trees.
Does anybody honestly think that printing a QR code is more efficient, more user-friendly, and more environmentally friendly than NFC? Updating POS terminals to display QR codes isn't cheap either. If there isn't a financial benefit to rolling out NFC at these businesses, there is no way in hell they'll use bitcoin instead. NFC ubiquity can only help bitcoin adoption.

Fees weren’t pointless back in December last year when it cost $20 per transaction. With limited block space, fees are a way to prioritise  which transactions to process. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 04:37:39
Pretty much. 
The public address is derived from the private key. Every private key has a corresponding public address. And it is mathematically impossible to reverse the process and derive a private key from a public address. 
In order to transfer coins, you must provide a digital signature (signed with a private key). This proves you own the private key without actually revealing the key.
This means you can give out a public address (or addresses) and people can send coins to it. Transactions into that address will be relayed by other users and verified by the miners. You only need to be online to check the balance of an address or to broadcast a transaction.

There is an agreed upon formula for setting the difficulty based on how long it took to mine previous blocks. 
If you try to submit a block that is mined at a lower difficulty than what is currently set...then your block will get rejected by the other users in the network. What determines the difficulty is simply that everyone agrees to play by the same rules.

@_date: 2019-06-11 12:18:50
Think of every lightning channel state as a valid bitcoin transaction that is waiting to be broadcast. 
Your lightning wallet might add safeguards against broadcasting what it knows is an older state. But there is no way for the blockchain to know if a broadcasted state is the most recent  or not. That information is only shared between the users in the channel. The only way is to wait an agreed upon time to see if a newer state is broadcast to override it. 
There are proposals to improve this, but they require changes to the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:30:59
The thing with encryption and math is that it’s really hard to understand just how big some of these numbers really are. 2 to the power of 128 is a really...really big number. 
There are more possible seed combinations than there are atoms in the onbservable universe. Or something like that. Its just not viable to try to brute force. 
These big numbers are the basis for most encryption schemes. The seed phrase is just a human readable way to store the information. The seed words represent numbers.
The BIP39 standard is the most commonly used format for seed phrases.

There are plenty of reasons not keep your coins on an exchange, unless you’re actively trading. 
How many more exchanges going under do we need to see before people realise this?
Unfortunately using a hardware or software wallet isn’t the best experience either. Electrum is under DDOS right now and the hardware wallet I bought (Ledger Nano S) recently had firmware update issues. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:57:32
That’s how cryptography works. If it was possible to recover access to something that’s encrypted without needing the private key, then the whole system would break down.
Being mathematically irrevocable certainly carries risks. Right now all you can do is mitigate it through storing coins across multiple addresses, or using multi-signature addresses, or some other form of smart contract with timeouts.
But on the other hand there are risks in relying on third parties too. They can get hacked, or compromised, or make decisions you disagree with and block access to your money if they decide to. 
Bitcoin isn’t perfect and it still has a long way to go if it ever wants to become mainstream. Maybe it never will. But I’m still excited by the possibilities it offers.

There is a limited supply of Bitcoin, so more adoption means more outside money entering the ecosystem, which pushes the price up. Other cryptocurrencies might become standard instead, but if Bitcoin specifically becomes to widely adopted, the price will rise.

That’s kind of the point, really. You don’t need to trust anybody in order to use it. That’s it’s core value.

Technology adoption tends to follow an "S Curve". I expect the Bitcoin price to do the same overall.
The question is where on the curve are we? Nobody knows. It could level off in a few years, or it could explode another 100x or 1000x.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:16:20
In my experience it’s called a scam by people who don’t understand how it works. They see Bitcoin as a “traditional” system where a company makes them, controls them, and sells them to buyers. 
This is understandable as it’s a model of how almost things work in our business world. But jumping to the model of a distributed peer to peer network with nobody in charge s a much more complex thing to understand. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:29:30
You’re right. It’s risky and requires a decent level of technical knowledge, but the bigger point is that before bitcoin there was zero way to do such a thing even if you wanted to.
In 2008 if you wanted to “be your own bank” your only option was to stash money in your mattress. Now bitcoin offers a digital equivalent. That’s the core technological breakthrough. 
Maybe you don’t want to do that, but clearly some people do. In time I think these problems and risks will be addressed in various ways. Making it safer and more reliable to “be your own bank”. The internet initially required a high level of technical knowledge and had risks involved too. It takes time to develop the tech for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:49:39
It’s called the “double spend problem”. If I send you a digital payment, how do you ensure I can’t also send that payment to other people? Computers are great at copying things. But money isn’t something you want people to be able to copy. 
Banks and credit card companies and PayPal solve it by being a central authority who check each transaction to ensure they’re legitimate. Bitcoin solves it in a different, decentralised, way. 
No solution is objectively better. Each has pros and cons. But bitcoin’s is new and people are still figuring out how to best make use of it and how to improve on it. 
It might end up as a niche technology with limited use....and the price will stay low. Or it may end up as something as widespread and common as email and web browsing is today...in that case the value will increase a lot. That’s the bet you make when you buy into the bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:39:29
To play devils advocate: The network in its current stage doesn’t represent the typical use cases of mass adoption. So the network topography may change over time. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:23:33
There’s nothing wrong with it, I just don’t consider it particular user-friendly for the “masses”, which is why I’m confused to see such huge increases in segwit now that it’s supported in the new client. 
Either something else has caused segwit adoption to increase at the same time, or there really is a big percentage of transaction volume using the core client. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:15:37
This is how I felt back in early 2014. Never invested more than I was willing to lose but it still sucks. 4 years of HODLing paid off though. But who knows what the next 4-5 years will bring. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:41:55
If somebody sends you bitcoin over Lightning, you can two things with it. 1) close your channel and get your coins back and spend them as you would any other bitcoin you own. 2) keep your channel open and pay for stuff on the Lightning network. 
In simple terms...off-chain transactions are just a way to defer broadcasting to the Blockchain. But they’re done in such a way that there is still no trust needed between users. On-chain transactions are used as settlements. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:17:12
People were saying this when the price was $10,  and again at $100, and again at $1000. Not that this growth can increase indefinitely, but the more you zoom out on the price charts, and the longer you hold, the less of a concern these fluctuations are. 
The HODL from 2014 to 2017 was long. But if it wasn’t money you were willing to lose, it wasn’t a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:23:04
I’m honestly curious, because I don’t know of any examples of a distributed, immutable, public database with no central authority. I thought bitcoin was the first. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:25:15
The official Ledger wallet connects to Ledger's own servers, so when those are overloaded people have run into trouble sending their transactions.
Fortunately you can use the Ledger Nano S with third party wallets like Electrum. But it's still not ideal, since I think the official wallet UI is pretty nice. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:43:50
That’s the goal. I don’t know how the technical infrastructure behind my bank or credit cards work. But they make it easy for anyone to send payments.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:16:36
The breakthrough with blockchains is the ability to have a decentralised database where changes can only be made in specific ways, and those changes are undoable. There is nothing about currency there. But currency is an obvious use case. 
You could use a blockchain for things other than recording transactions. The tokens are used to incentivise miners to keep the system running. 
In theory if you had altruistic miners, they would mine for free and the system is used to record other types of data. 
You could also have a blockchain with a central authority. That defeats the purpose of decentralisation but there other potential use cases there. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:23:03
You’re right that centralised systems are better for certain people in certain circumstances. 
In a bigger sense, decentralisation allows bitcoin to be an open platform. Similar to the internet itself: A world-wide information network that no company or government has control over. That wasn’t possible without decentralisation. It was a neat idea back in the mid 90’s but it really took off as people found new uses for it. 
Who knows what possibilities a world-wide decentralised payment platform will allow? That future value is what bitcoin investors like myself are betting on. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:27:26


Apparently a future version of their wallet software will automatically add and remove on-device apps to make this process easier. Still not ideal though.

@_date: 2018-02-01 08:15:06
Their work is brilliant, but to me it all leans in one direction: More powerful side-chain and “layer 2” capabilities while making it harder/impossible for miners to do anything about it. 
I actually think this is a good approach, because the possibilities that new scripting and signature architectures allow are exciting. But are there other areas of research that are being ignored?
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:27:39
My understanding is that you only use one on-chain transaction to close your channel. That transaction contains the final balance of all addresses in the channel, and the blockchain doesn't need to know what happened in between.

When the price exploded in December and I tried to recover my wallet from a backup seed, I tried installing Electrum using Ubuntu running from a USB drive. 
Apt-get install Electrum did not work. I had to track down python dependencies and use pip easy installer to get the rest. 
Then it was hell figuring it how to get my printer working so I could print off a new round of backup seeds. 
The whole ordeal was a steaming pile of shit to be honest. I know my way around a unix terminal and there is no way in hell an “average user” would have been capable of getting beyond figuring out how to copy an ISO to a USB drive in the first place. 
If we really want widespread adoption, desktop users are not where we should be focussing anyway. We need secure open source mobile wallets. Wallets with good UX and a catchy name that people can install from the Google and Apple app stores.

Time to start monitoring these wallets and waiting for any incoming transactions!

This is exactly why the devs say it will take time to implement. They need to be sure their implementation and the signature scheme itself are safe.

I also bought at the all time high....in 2013. My investment isn’t looking so stupid now. Be patient.

There are numerous bitcoin forks with increased block size limits. You’re free to use any of them.

Bitcoin’s greatest threat is if nobody manages to make something that’s widespread and useful from it. 
If the lightning network can’t manage to reliably and securely handle a large number of new users. If the wallet designers can’t manage to built user friendly interfaces. Etc. 
If that doesn’t happen, it will always remain as a niche product and the price will be almost entirely based on speculation.

Miners still collect transaction fees.

When I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, it was a technical curiosity. When I first bought some in 2013, I could actually use it to buy some stuff at retail stores. Now it’s in the mindshare of central bankers, senate hearings, heads of stock exchanges, and all my friends and extended family know about it. Nobody is in charge and it keeps spreading, like a force of nature. 
Another hyperbolic speculation price spike is probably a few years away, so stay focussed on other things. The tech just keeps getting better, and people will find new things to do with it. It’s not going anywhere.

That’s fine since they’re not contributing to the network. I don’t know how you could measure that other than inspecting their settlement transactions. 
The great thing about many of the upcoming bitcoin soft forks is that any of these on-chain settlement transactions become indistinguishable from other on-chain transactions.

It’s never a question. Keep holding.
