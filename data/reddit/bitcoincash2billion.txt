So, it makes those things different than Bitcoin, which has zero intrinsic value.
Therefore you shouldn't compare your failed coin with stuff that is Above Zero in intrinsic worth.

Gold has non-zero intrinsic value.
That is crucial

Both bitcoin and blockchain are useless and going to zero.
I don't care about inner workings of technology, you have to package it into a finished product.
For example: "Have you ever wanted to anonymously raise money towards toppling Assad? Now you can!"
But I hear that bitcoin usage can actually be tracked.

So, now you have carte blanche to invent Any Stupid Thing, and if anyone doubts it, you reply: "They said that about the internet too."

This has to go down to 3 digits quick

Everyone is entitled to found his own Bitcoin.
It just so happens that Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin Broke.
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:30:22
So you guys don't care which coin is better; the main thing to you is to salvage your own investment you sunk into Bitcoin Noncash.

First rule of business, Nothing is guaranteed.
So all these people claiming that bitcoin will succeed, are just dumb, but above all Broke children.

Bitcoin has no utility.
How can it be used for anonymity when the government is already taxing bitcoin. How do they tax something anonymous?
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:59:40
Taxation is theft

It's amazing that even some people with Economic Training fell for cryptos.
For example Robert Murphy

I missed the opportunity to lose 85% like you, yes.
OK So if it isn't anonymous, then tax evaders find it useless as well.

They wanted to get Lambos via bitcoin, so they went apeshit when someone introduced bitcoin 2.0 thus leaving them behind in the dust.
Their goal is to shut down competition really, much like bankster reptilians from mars.
