Buying the dip, means you’re buying a visible dip in the charts. Imagine you have a chip and you dip it in salsa. If you track your hand as you dip, you can see your point of purchase, and see the chip come back out of the dip. The amount of salsa, the better and that is a perfect representation of the optimal buying point. Then you can enjoy your sweet sweet hot gains.
