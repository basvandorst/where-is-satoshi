@_date: 2018-01-22 14:01:06
The problem is no party will have any knowledge about whether the money is illegitimate or not. A bank can't possibly let money pass when they don't know who's sending it and don't know who's receiving it. That's exactly what being an LN node means. KYC 101 is knowing who's the sender and who's the receiver. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:56:39
After being here since 2013 the decline of the tone in the community is nothing less than saddening. I hold 0 BCH and I don't believe in it, but the constant throwing of shit back and forth will benefit nothing and nobody. It's not surprising given the general conversation in society where social media structures highlight the agitating and controversial opinions and more nuanced opinions are ignored. I just thought we were better than that.
I completely agree with what I heard, in person, Andreas say in one of his talks: we need to have sober conversations between people of different opinions instead of always assuming that the other group are genuinely bad people with the intent of making our world a living hell. Admittedly, this is a human trait (or flaw?), but it's nevertheless extremely bad for progress.
I personally believe BCH is an inferior coin and I am fully confident in the success of BTC, but I see just as much shit behavior coming out of both sides.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:52:14
As I see it, and this is not my home turf, it's more of a situation that the bank doesn't care that you're a ID verified customer if you show up with a bag of cash wanting to make a transaction and say it's from someone else and you don't know where it's heading or what the transaction is for. I assume mostly though it's just really complicated to translate to rules that were designed for the fiat system which is an argument in itself to stay away from it.

This is like asking if you should buy BTC now or wait until it drops a little. Only you can decide if it's worth paying $180 to protect $30k from theft and fraud.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:16:23
Have you tried CPFC?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:12:08
No this is not true. The problem is if you are verified with the exchange and bitpay's verified Merchant B has a channel open to Crook C, then I as Crook A can send money to Crook C with a route through you-&gt;exchange-&gt;bitpay-&gt;merchant B-&gt;Crook. There is no way for any party to see this chain or know what role in the chain they're playing. They can't tell if you as a verified customer sent it or if I as a crook sent it. The exchange can't tell if bitpay is the recipient or if a crook is the recipient. This kind of opaque shuffling of money is not something any KYC compliant exchange would touch with a ten foot pole. And again, I can't wait for LN to roll out but after hearing Andreas on this topic today I'm sure it won't involve any of the big exchanges. It won't have to though.

Dang it, another part I missed in the crypto elitist handbook. Will not happen again.

What I mean is just like the noobs coming in to ask when they should buy, we can not answer for you if it's worth waiting for a smaller mempool while holding 2 BTC as collateral. You obviously know it's a risky move, make a decision based on your knowledge instead of asking strangers on the internet about what to do. If the price shoots up to 20K the mempool will be an absolute mess, same if it drops. We don't know the future better than you do.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:35:06
Yeah annoying that Google shows the same shit over and over
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:40:58
There is 0 chance that any of the regulated exchanges will act as LN nodes because of how LN is designed. There is no way of knowing who's the sender and who's the recipient when routing a LN transaction, making all KYC and AML efforts collapse entirely. Andreas talks about this in the latest episode of LTB. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:38:12
Um yeah I'm not going to use bitcoin less to direct the general conversation in one way or another. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:56:10
I'm not familiar enough with the regulations but it sure is concerning. If you have a channel to coinbase and I want to send money to a merchant it can go via you and coinbase without either of you knowing where it's coming from or what the final destination is. Not even the recipient would know the route. Nobody would know if it was 2 hops or the maximum 20 hops. For a financial institution (exchange) this is obviously something they can't participate in (as I see it).
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:28:42
Let's try to keep it up? How? By using bitcoin less?

@_date: 2018-01-22 15:46:07
Haha what? Not sure what your point is there. I love LN and I'm confident it will be a success, just saying that the big regulated exchanges like Coinbase will never act as a LN nodes due to their compliance to financial regulations. Thus we don't have to fear them becoming centralized hubs in the LN either.

So I have a transaction stuck for almost three weeks now. I didn't send it so I can't do CPFP. It's at 56 satoshis /byte so it's nowhere near clearing. I've tried different acceleration services to no avail.
My question is this: when is this going to be dropped from the network? It seems only super low fee transactions are being dropped? Am I in a true limbo here?

I was stunned when I found bitcasino.io. I haven't tried their sportsbetting but it looks perfectly intuitive and well designed like the rest of the site. This probably sounds like I'm a paid shill or something but it's just that I love gambling and was missing the usual games from the same providers that my non-bitcoin gambling site offers. I'm still amazed by how many "regular" slots, blackjacks etc they have and how smoothly integrated they've gotten it to bitcoin. Plus they have great VIP bonuses and 0 confirmation deposits which is nice.

Forgot to mention in the title this is a case in the European Court of Justice. For background and context follow the first link in the blog post.
I would say this ruling is extremely important for the near- to medium-term future of bitcoin in the EU. All 28 nations in the European Union are bound to follow the rulings of the ECJ as European "hard law" triumphs all national law - including constitutions (theoretically). This has nothing to do with P2P-transactions and exchanges but companies such as Safello and BTCX that sells bitcoin to consumers (very important business models for spreading adoption imo) would be forced to impose VAT to their sales which of course would harm their business model severely. In Sweden the base VAT rate is 25% so the price compared to the recieved value would be ridiculous.

They still have capital gains (I presume). It's just that companies selling bitcoin to the general public doesn't have to charge their customers VAT. Which is good of course since it brings regulatory certainty, but I doubt that any company does that today.

If I defended this guy the two options would basically be a plea deal or maybe find some technicality that would throw off the case (extremely unlikely).

You think it will go away with enough inflaming and degrading memes on a subreddit where all users already made up their mind? It's all about spreading rings on the water and educating your acquaintances, encouraging them to do their own research. Roger using his money and power to consciously mislead newbies is of course despicable but painting a picture of him wanting to see the world burn is, as I said, counter productive and won't get one single Bcasher to change their mind. It will, however, divide the general crypto community leading to unforeseeable and potentially disastrous consequences in the long run.

Well the company is still up and running and they described it as them being very helpful with sorting out the difficulties of not knowing the money's origin etc. With that in fresh memory I interpret this news as WF being genuinely curios, but then again Snapcard could have been exaggerating to make their customers feel comfortable and/or it could have been an unusually service minded banking contact on a small WF branch, who knows.

Because you get free PR in the bitcoin space and you can reach out to early adopters with a lot of bitcoin but not enough in cash. Naturally, he would have accepted cash as well so there are only upsides for the seller. The article clearly states that it was converted to dollars and that kind of money is enough to move the markets a bit, creating a chain effect.
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:27:35

To be clear for non-swedish users: This store is really huge in national terms with a 18% annual growth and a 145 million USD turnover (pretty amazing for a country with 9 million citizens). They sell pretty much the same stuff as TigerDirect.

You can read a bit about their supremacy here: 
To be clear: I'm not sure how well the word constitution translates but as for Sweden for example we have four major constitutional laws (how the royal title is inherited, freedom of press etc) that requires two parliamentary votings with one election in between in order to change them. Still, the same day the EU court of justice rules something else (in for example a case that started in Bulgaria) that ruling goes before the constitutional laws. 
In other words, if the court decides bitcoins are digital goods not exempt of VAT that goes for ALL companies in all 27 nations. I'm not fully familiar with this case so I don't know any details about the true implications or what the probable outcome will be but I do know that 3 weeks is a very short period of time and anyone willing to see bitcoin succeed should donate money to this guy.

A lot of it can probably be explained by the fast paced video with intense music and the fact that I don't know any background. I've seen the name and thought about it as some kind of eBay for bitcoin, but from what I could tell by the frames flicking by this is something way more complicated. I'm sure I would be super excited if I was into the whole technical side of bitcoin, but that's not your fault. I get excited from things like Circle and Hive.

Sure, initiatives to make him feel better is cute and kind but seems like this community has forgotten what gave us the heart breaking feeling in the first place. This is a peculiar old man who has made it very clear over and over again that he doesn't want any attention. At all. He just wants to live his slow life with his trains. Leave him alone. CheapAir is riding on the attention and only adding to his stress.

Yeah, well... This particular argument, although true to some extent, isn't something I can stand behind. SR was never meant to be anything else but a drug market and 99% of the users probably saw it as no more than a drug market. I loved it, but let's not bend the truth here.

I'm so tired of this rethoric. No, of course you can't regulate the actual protocol, nobody thinks that, but of course you can regulate how to use it. A government could effectively forbid all companies and economic entities to do anything with bitcoin, rendering it useless. Would that be a stupid move? Yes. Would it be impossible because "it's a fucking decentralized protocol man you can't fucking touch that shit with your filthy hands"? No.

Yes, this was famously demonstrated by Germany with the so called Solange doctrine which basically was a threat that the nation would ignore all EU law unless the nations constitutional human rights were respected. This has led to the EU expanding their human rights focus etc in order not to step on anybody's toes. If the EUCOJ for example would change the way Sweden's royalty is inherited then of course parliamentary chaos would ensue, but still, all nations have agreed that EU law will overrule national law on all levels.

I've always used multibit and gotten to know the functions really well but it just happens way to often that transactions are not broadcasted on the blockchain, and everything looks normal in the client so I don't always notice it until way after. I can't keep double check each transaction. Also, when this happens there is no way to set it right except reseting the blockchain, and if I reset the entire blockchain my balance will still be messed up. Instead I have to manually choose a date that I know is before my first transaction. It's just a mess sometimes. Furthermore, I don't like the way it handles transaction fees. It's automatical which I am fine with but it doesn't say how much fee it will withdraw which makes it a guessing game when I try to clean out adresses, leaving them with very little small amounts left when I abandon them.

It is still an extremely risky investment that people can treat themselves with when times are good. When times are bad the big guys are fleeing to safe havens.

It's not exactly the currency of the internet

Yes. People really need to let go of the idea of bitcoin having any value for average Joe's everyday transactions. Credit cards are no hassle as it is and mobile payments are pretty much standard over big parts of Europe, working amazingly well. There is absolutely no reason for the vast majority of people to buy stuff with bitcoin. Bitcoins future lies in bank settlements, remittances and possibly smart contracts etc.

What's going on in this thread? This is huge news. This is one of the biggest thefts in modern history AFAIK and, above all, 100 million USD worth of bitcoin thought to be locked down for the foreseeable future by the market could of course impact the price of bitcoin if they start to move.

If you have spendable balance left in the wallet you're spending from you can force it through with child-pays-for-parent. Go to settings in multibit and raise the fee to 0.00018 or something and then send everything that's left to an address you control and all transactions should be confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:41:49
Wait a minute. I noticed now that you are right that the slider is denominated in BTC per KB but with the slider set to for example 0.0002 it will always send a 0.0002 fee. So a 226 byte transaction will get a 88 sat/byte fee.
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:21:08

The guarantee can't be removed as Greece would quickly get sanctions from the commission if they did so. However, according to your link, the banks could still take deposits (in case of insolvency) and the issue would then be that the guarantee only covers up to 3bn euro.

What kind of asshat is downvoting this curious and interested guy? You elitist pricks is what makes me embarrassed of the whole space sometimes. 
OP: you have excellent concerns and many of that have been excellently addressed if you search around. Bitcoins real problem, however, is getting it to sync with existing financial structures (compliance, aml etc). This is rarely discussed since a lot of bitcoiners are idealist liberterians rather than realist libertarians.

Remember when they built Burj Al Arab in Dubai? It cost $650,000,000.
If you equate $650,000,000 in terms of bitcoin, this would equate to a bitcoin price of $43 per bitcoin assuming 15 million of the 21 million bitcoin were mined.
So unfortunately, buying bitcoin now is a terrible deal.

That would of course mean nothing if ECJ would have ruled for VAT. Now luckily they didn't do that which is a huge deal for the regulatory certainty that all BTC vendors in all 28 states rely on. I'm baffled by how little attention this is getting on while memes and delusional moon charts are discussed at length everyday. This is a huge deal and again, no nation in the Union will be allowed to impose VAT on bitcoin sales even if national laws clearly allow it.

Easier to get? Yes. Easier to understand? Yes. More software and exchanges? Yes. More reason for people to buy it except speculation? Not really. The only field where it's amazingly useful as of today is (except drugs which has always been bitcoins thing) remittances and even that is accompanied with exchange fees and volatility risk. Don't get me wrong I wholly understand the potential of the protocol, there's just no reason for anyone to buy it.

Kinda cringeworthy to bring that up in regards to this. This guy is likely responsible for a lot of criminals getting away with exchange hacks, scams, phishing, blackmailing, darknetmarkets exitscams etc. All that kind of bullshit that decent people lost a lot of savings to. I'm not defending HSBC in any way but that knee-jerk reaction to an article mentioning money laundering and bitcoin in the same context is nothing but counterproductive to the greater good in the bitcoin space. It's like Trump supporters going on about Hillary's emails.
EDIT: Maybe I'm wrong to assume everyone was involved in bitcoin back when Gox went down. If you weren't, let me assure you it was heartbreaking to see people losing so much money and moreover it was an extremely hard blow to bitcoin as a whole, which we are still recovering from imo.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:22:50
If you are truly interested you need to step out of the echo chamber that is right now. Do your own investigation and ignore everything you come over that promises you will get rich. Bitcoin is an extremely risky investment with tons of flaws which can only get adressed to some degree. Also, bitcoin usage is falling in the sense that most bitcoins never move and even big merchants such as Overstock see great declines in their bitcoin sales.

You have a point regarding the infrastructure but still, adoption and actual usefulness are very low still and a HUGE difference in the Internet comparison is that we now have the advantage of the web to spread the word quickly. Still nobody is using bitcoin because there are no reasons to use bitcoin for average Joe.

If it was a couple of BTC then sorry, but spare yourself the headache and buy back BTC instead. If you're lucky you'll get a better price.

Tell me you've never heard "Furniture king", "EV pioneer", "Clothing manager". If new people can't read past the headline to the article where it's absolutely clear and accurate then they probably aren't that interested in bitcoin after all. I can't believe this shitpost. Absolutely incredible. 
By the way, reporters don't set headlines so either way this can't be classified as bad reporting.

RichR17 one question for you. Is Elon Musk the official CEO of tech companies? If not; could he still be a tech company CEO?
It worries me that this community has such a hard time grasping very basic semantics.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:29:47
What do you mean they stated Bitcoin has a CEO? Are you trying to misinterpret on purpose?
Unlike you I was a bitcoiner way back when MSM actually thought Bitcoin had a CEO, this is not it. If they called Sundar Pichai a Silicon Valley CEO would you think that implied he was actually the CEO of the entire Silicon Valley?

Compare "Silicon Valley CEO released on bail in embezzlement case" with "Bitcoin CEO released on bail in embezzlement case". If you read the former headline, would you think that Silicon Valley had a CEO that was released on bail or would you think that a CEO in Silicon Valley was released on bail? Is English your first language?
