That means my node is basically useless: I don't use it as wallet, and other peers can't connect to it.

And what if I cant open this port? I am installed full node at work, but  then realized the ports are not open, and the IT guy will not open for me.  Has the full node, wich cant accept incomming connections meaning? I am not using this node as wallet. Thank you!

Great article, but bitstamp has zero running nodes, they outsource the whole payment process...

You can turn on 2FA for adding another withdrawal address (kraken). I always use new withdrawal address in kraken - yes, it is not user friendly...

From bitcoin cash perspective  btc2x will be a better coin than btc [because of 2MB block increase], right? So why have people in so positive attitude for segwit2x fork? If it will be successfull it will create a better coin =&gt; bitcoin cash will have lower probality to defeat bitcoin2x. The advantage of bitcoin cash will be half what it is today [from block size perspective =  1/8  versus 2/8]. I dont get it...

Have you tried use earn.com? If you have a verified profile with company email address, linkedin profil linked, etc you can earn 5-6$ monthly by joining shitty telegram ICO groups. You are paid in btc, the withdrawal fees are low.
