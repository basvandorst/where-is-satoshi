I totally get where you're coming from, and I have to imagine the larger supply of dogecoins will keep it cheaper than Bitcoin, for example. But, I think it stands a decent chance of becoming significantly valuable, perhaps the penny to Bitcoin's dollar or something like that.

I've seen plenty of tips for 100 doge or even 1000+ doge which is now worth more than a penny easily. Who are you to say what it may or may not be worth one day? I don't think anyone can predict that.


If you want to have a conversation, don't resort to petty insults. You are exactly the kind of person that is giving Bitcoin a bad name.

There's more than 100 billion dollars around and the dollar is still worth a dollar.

You are exactly the kind of person that is being talked about in this thread as rude, uninviting and turning people away from the cryptocurrency community.

Or they're just offering an alternative to Bitcoin that's a bit more light hearted and fun. Plus the barrier to mining is incredibly low relative to Bitcoin.

You can have fun and be taken seriously. Apparently people don't get that.

So in your world only Bitcoin can be successful? That's such an unrealistic point of view. Look at the history of the world. There's plenty of room for multiple contenders in the same arena.
I'm rooting for Bitcoin just as much as I'm rooting for Dogecoin. I'm not so high on my own ego to think that only the coin I invest my time in should be valued. I'd like to see cryptocurrencies succeed in general. It would be a big win for lots of people, not just those invested in Bitcoin.

Many doge tips are 100 doge or more. As of this writing (1/21/14 at about noon central time) 100 doge is worth about 2 cents, so we didn't even have to wait a full day for you to be proven wrong.
And why do you keep capitalizing math? It's not a proper noun.

A mod tries to start discussion about a relatively new altcoin and you open with "hey jackass." You must be a blast to hang out with.

If you can explain Bitcoin, explaining Dogecoin is not any more difficult. Just because you are invested in Bitcoin does not mean Dogecoin cannot go anywhere.

The face of the shiba dog also comes with an open and welcoming attitude. The difference doesn't have to be in the software, it can also lay with the community itself.
