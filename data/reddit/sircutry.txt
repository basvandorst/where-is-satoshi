Is HTTP a subset of HTTPS?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:39:02
I was just curious because freeradicalx referenced HTTP and you corrected with HTTPS.

It's a cultural thing, a tradition. I think we can move on and people understand that a BTC is **a lot** of money. Then mbits are the magnitude you get paid monthly at. But the change isn't overnight.

Okay. I was after the reason they raise the price by that amount. But what I found out googling is that when a bid and an offer are at the same price, they are (at least in part) fulfilled and the price jumps to that price point.    Take pair X/Y:Bid 2 X @ 105 Y per XAsk 1.5 X @ 105 Y per XThen the ask gets fulfilled, and bid has 0.5 X remaining. But the price is now 105 Y per X. So any market price orders should now fulfill the bid.    I'm not sure this is correct.

That's about half a percent, isn't that many times better than the current state of affairs?

If the fees are that high in the wallet you use, you should change to a wallet that lets you assign priority. It shouldn't be more than a couple dollars.

Would allow more people to get that whole Bitcoin.

Let me rephrase: What in the ledger causes the change?

The exchange does set the price based on supply and demand, but how exactly? How does price matching affect the price?

[It's a nice number.](

Many retailers don't just deal in Bitcoin. The payment method is selected at checkout.

When does the price move?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:01:46
How exactly? How does the exchange know what the price should be?

Is there something the protocol could do to prevent this?

The numeral in question is greater than the numeral "nine thousands".

You can divide Bitcoins into 100-millionths. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:35:12
What I mean is that currently, you can use hundred millionths (Satoshis) to trade Bitcoin. Actually, there's no other way because the protocol is based on Satoshis.

Bitcoin was at about 2700 dollars two months ago.

The cryptocurrency with the second largest market cap, Ethereum, is basically a distributed computing system where state changes are triggered with transactions. You should look into it. There are many other interesting uses for cryptocurrencies.

Something that has functionality beyond currency.
