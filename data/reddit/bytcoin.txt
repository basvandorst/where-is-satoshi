Mike "I'm an expensive guy" Hearn...
He was obvious.
Roger "Cry for the camera" Ver is also obvious.
Danger lies with the not obvious ones. Trust no one.

Not sure if serious, but, is this what you call a good idea?:
"Anybody who goes on a website [...] should go to jail."
Glance again!

People selfishly pursuing ther own ends WILL work. If it doesn't, then austrian economics is wrong. You have no idea what is happening in indonesia, thailand, chad or wherever. Growth comes from the unseen.

For me it's almost $40 and no more web access for the rest of the month. 100GB is my datacap.
Maybe think of the people who don't have the things you have, mr richie-spoil?

So poor people are not allowed to SYNC a new node? Interesting opinion. Go fuck yourself.

That's not freedom, that's wealth. Wealth you can enjoy thanks to your ancestors and peers being imperialists and scientists.

There does grow mushrooms with psilocybin in sweden, the Psilocybe semilanceata (and some lesser ones), but they are very much forbidden yes. I would not sell those by my road no, especially since we often see police driving by on their motorcycle training rounds =)

Backstory: I live in rural Sweden and just having some fun with my neighbor selling mushrooms by the road. No one has used bitcoin out here, but after stoppping for some shrooms they will be curious...

Someone sent money to two addresses with known private keys, derived from the genesis block. The network is scanned bots looking fo funds coming in to such addresses and funds automatically sent away to a "proper"(unknown private key) address controlled by the lucky bot-builder that can first detect money coming in and send a stealing transaction out. The botbuilder's adress was a segwit address. This was shown in an image with missleading context to imply that bitcoin is broken and SegWit being an evil that let "the devs" take anyone's money.

Top-heavy, sure, but it is a system where any peasant or artisan can generate his own "bank account" using only dice and an offline PC.
(S)He then performs the job and is HAPPY. The world is HAPPIER for what (s)he built.

Peace of mind. If he does not return it, a life of wondering when he will be murdered and if torture will be involved, or a life of trying to forget that very question with hard drugs, awaits.

Living is hard work however you point your arse. Actually many multiples harder when you opt out of society and all of it's comfort. (Still worth it IMO)
Basic income is just the next socialist fever-dream.
