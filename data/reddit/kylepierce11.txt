Here , have a dogecoin. You get a little grumpy when you're hungry. +20 doge
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:17:18
I'm pretty young, like college aged, so if I just put 1% it'd be like 20 dollars. I did exchange my old dogecoins I bought when they were like worth cents for half a bitcoin, so I've got that going for me. I think I'm gonna just set up an autopurchase of 10 bucks every two weeks and see what that gets me. Maybe do the same for ETH. Maybe if I hold for 10 years I'll be able to pay off my student debt.

/pol/ kinda reappropriated the whole kek thing and made it about trump. Made kek a god or some shit, "praise kek" "in the name of kek" etc. It just kinda became a meme throughout the election to tie it to him, I really don't understand why.

This subreddit is a very small percentage of Bitcoin owners. Hardly a good example of the overall mentality of owners. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:43:34
Hey, you know what they say. HODL
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:10:43
Shit, after today's drop I see your point 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:59:08
It just sounds like there's 0 risks being attached to that, but that there's a chance legacy might suffer. Maybe I'm reading it wrong. I've got it all stored in electrum right now but I typically trade through coinbase, who I think is against this change. Guess I'll figure out the best course of action once August first arrives.

I am definitely focusing on my degree and not buying more than I can afford to lose. I'm just going into a career field that it might be good to have a bit of a side investment in, it isn't exactly steady work. I make about $75 a week right now, my college schedule doesn't allow for much work, so 20 bucks every two weeks won't hurt me bad. I might cancel my ETH purchases if it ends up not working out but right now it looks decent.  
Is a Coinbase wallet not a secure way of holding your BTC? I don't have room on my laptop to download the full blockchain so I have to use some sort of online wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:00:07
I guess for someone like me who just invested in BTC and other cryptos for the hopes of it paying off monetarily, I'm confused on this. It's more of a project to kind of donate to by getting tokens and less of a possible investment?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:11:59
We're actually still up $62 from where we were 24 hours ago. Not sure it's stabilized but it has been rising back the past few hours.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:52:00
I wish someone could give me an ELI5 on this whole thing. Are there going to be two types of BTC now? UASF and legacy? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:57:34
I tried to research what that is but don't understand it. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:10:53
I'm new to this, what exactly is a bubble?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:43:29
Yeah Coinbase claims to be backed up and secured but I'll check out Electrum just in case. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:21:36
I mean I'm "new". I've bought bitcoin multiple times to pay for stuff, and have used various cryptocurrencies, but only just now starting really paying attention to it because I found I still had some dogecoin that I could trade into BTC that I forgot I had. So I might be an outlier, I don't know. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:14:16
I mean are wallets impacted by this? I hold mine in electrum then trade them on coinbase (who I've heard is against this stuff)
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:34:37
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:04:35
How would one go about sending them to the other chain if this should be needed? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:06:15
I'm new to Bitcoin, is the $60 drop that just happened this past hour just business as usual? Hadn't seen that big of a drop in the past week I've been watching the prices.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:48:11
It appears to just be the insane rise of the past week correcting itself, but nobody can know for sure. I'm holding onto mine. I mean hodling.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:44:23
I've never heard of Golem. Why should someone invest in it, just out of curiosity? Hard to be excited about a coin worth 31 cents at first glance but I'm curious. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:27:11
Thanks! So would the best move for a non-miner be to trade legacy coins to coins on the bip148 node or will it not affect them?
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:51:52
I don't want to speak to soon, but it looks to have calmed down around the 2k to 2.1k range.

Anyone that sells today is gonna regret it when BTC recovers from this crash. Ask anyone that sold back when it crashed in 2013. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:11:14
I bought them back when they were literally $0.10 for thousands of them and actually made a decent profit so I'm fine with buying into the meme haha
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:35:02
Still at 2200 and rising again. Looks like a random blip on the graph right now.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:58:00
I guess I'm just curious what's so promising about Golem that I'd invest in it like BTC or ETH or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:10:48
Yeah, I just know for me personally the time to sell was two days ago and I missed that chance, so now it's time for me to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:28:18
Maybe I'm misunderstanding things, but what I was trying to say is that I'm just going to keep storing my bitcoin in my electrum wallet and once August 1st comes around, if Coinbase ends up going against BIP148 and BIP148 wins, I'll use someone else for transactions/purchases. I hope that's the right course of action. Either way I'll contact them.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:48:18
Unless it's some rich people raising it on purpose by buying high so they can sell right before August 1st, thinking it's going to crash after then. (I don't think it will, but we'll see).
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:05:51
Well if electrum is supporting both possibly chains if there's a chain split, that's what I'm asking about. If it will hurt the worth. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:24:53
If I'm storing my coins in electrum do I even have to worry about anything? Seems like they're gonna support it. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:47:25
Any particular reason for the sudden $400 dip?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:39:47
Ssshhh. No logic. Only dreams now.
