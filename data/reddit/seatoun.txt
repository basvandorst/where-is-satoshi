It probably was written as a SMALL transaction from a wallet with a large amount in it. The sort you would never second check if it was a fiat transaction.

No, it is a bigger tax on compulsive savers, especially poor compulsive savers that haven't enough income to hire financial experts and hedge against inflation.

The fact that he has never given a few to a charity (which would generate huge returns in positive publicity today even if the coins would be worth far more tomorrow) could imply he is actually dead.

Agreed. If he never spends then we have a Sword of Damocles destabilising the system, where any rumour that he or a  a beneficiary of his estate might spend them en masse

Not quite. We are left with a Sword of Damocles type problem. Fast forward to a time when 99% of bitcoin is lost, then even speculation that those 7000 are found in one hit has destabilising potential. Worst of all would be if Satoshi dies without releasing his 1000,000 BTC stash.

No, the very rich are net borrowers. This is why people like Donald Trump sometimes have a negative worth of a few hundred million (hint - it could have something to do with owning other other assets such as property covered by other peoples money, and you should ask why they do that). When they get in financial troubles they have no worries, since they are in so deep that the banks have to run around sorting their problems out for them.

If the technology of bitcoin succeeds, you would expect volatility to decrease with time. If it goes down anything like 15 fold again (or even half that) then its time to reassess. Seriously! Remember it has already been hit by bad news recently, yet its acceptance continues to climb. IMHO all the signs are good.

A combination of the numerous errors that always plague my first draft, and my poor eyesight when correcting those. I was more wanting of your opinion than was of it.

Bitcoin is highly liquid. The only force here is in making them discover how to cash out or spend with a new technology that may be key to the future.

Yes, I remembered that Dorian message just after I posted.
But it makes complete sense to avoid needless words when action speaks louder. That explains Satoshi's reluctance to publicise, but just makes the absence of donation harder to explain (if he's alive)

cryptog may be simply referring to volatility,and how that can put (merchants) off holding for long enough to reorder with it. If so, this is way down, and the old talk that it can change by a factor of two in 24 hrs has all but disappeared.

Shouldn't that be 1 Calorie = 1000 calorie. The capital is important here.

I understand your Mt. Gox concern, but don't understand the BTC price deterioration one. Bitcoin has averaged a ten fold compound annual increase in its value since around its inception. How can you see a single six month period where its value halves as anything other than normal market volatility in any financial asset with that sort of underlying appreciation??

What a great way to put it! We must continually hammer home how important security is even in our wording usage, or when non-technical people become involved they will be too casual with their keys, then think it useful to look to legal recourse when they lose them.

Off block transactions have the Mt Gox problem 1) need 100% confidence in their trustworthiness 2) need 100% confidence in there software, or else may of BTC's  advantages over the USD disappear. 
Unfortunately the tragedy of the commons dictates large miners will only ever allow the block size in increase less than is needed.

There seems a considerable difficulty and psychological barrier to buying in to bitcoin. Interesting to see if any of that applies to cashing out.
