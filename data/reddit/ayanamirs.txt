Have both wallets. You don't gonna use your 12 words on bitwallet.
Then send all your bitcoins from bread to the new segwit address.
Non Segwit to Segwit = Non SegWit transaction/normal fees
If you are just holding, better if you wait the fee goes down before doing the transaction.
Bread is BIP 39 derivation path m/0'   - your 12 words only work in wallets with that option.
But if you just import your bread key to bitwallet, your bitcoins will still in a non segwit address.

If you want to wait bread support SegWit:
I guess it really depends on how the Bread Wallet devs implement the upgrade to SegWit. If they simply let you create multiple wallets within the app, you should be able to create a new SegWit wallet and then send from your current Bread Wallet to the SegWit Bread Wallet address.
If you're only allowed one wallet, then you'll have to find some way of creating the new SegWit wallet and then sending from your old wallet... maybe something very complicated and messy like:
- Make sure you have backup seed of old wallet
- Create new SegWit wallet with new seed
- Get new SegWit address from new SegWit wallet
- Restore old wallet with old seed
- Send all coins from old wallet to new SegWit Address
- Restore new SegWit wallet with new seed
Or you can send your coins to a completely different wallet (like Electrum), create your SegWit wallet and then send from different wallet to SegWit wallet...

Are taxes consistent with individual freedom and property rights?
Are taxes consistent with individual freedom and property rights? Is there a level of taxation where it is no more consistent? Hoppe: Taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. No. Taxes are never, at no level of taxation, consistent with individual freedom and property rights. Taxes are theft. The thieves — the state and its agents and allies — try their very best to conceal this fact, of course, but there is simply no way around it. Obviously, taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. Nor is it possible to construe taxes as normal rent-payments, as they are made by a renter to his landlord. Because the French state is not the landlord of all of France and all Frenchmen. To be the landlord, the French state would have to be able to prove two things: first, that the state, and no one else, owns every inch of France, and second, that it has a rental contract with every single Frenchman concerning the use, and the price for this use, of its property. No state — not the French, not the German, not the US-American or any other state — can prove this. They have no documents to this effect and they cannot present any rental contract. Thus, there is only one conclusion: taxation is theft and robbery by which one segment of the population, the ruling class, enriches itself at the expense of another, the ruled.

No state — not the French, not the German, not the US-American or any other state — can prove this. They have no documents to this effect and they cannot present any rental contract. Thus, there is only one conclusion: taxation is theft and robbery by which one segment of the population, the ruling class, enriches itself at the expense of another, the ruled.

The government don't own any land, you are wrong.
This argument would be valid if the event were held on privately owned property, and not on property positively controlled by the State. States cannot legitimately own land.
Due to the way that States are created, obtain their funding, and obtain their land -- fundamentally, due to the nature of the State itself -- it is simply impossible for a State to have a property right in anything. There are several ways that States can come to positively control land, none of which gives them a normative private property right in that land:
1. By buying the land from previous owners. Since usually States must be financed by taxes (stolen money), any acquisitions made by States are illegitimate. Even in the States of old that did not tax, they were still coercive monopolies on protection (that is, they violently prevent anyone from competing with them in the rendering of protection). Thus, we cannot claim that the money they obtained was legitimate -- they wouldn't have obtained that much if not for violently preventing competition.
2. By decree. The unoccupied land is "declared" to belong to the State. This is not a legitimate way to come into ownership of land. To obtain a property right over something, you must first homestead it. Simply pointing around yourself in a 360-degree circle and saying "mine" doesn't constitute homesteading. Actually working the land does.
3. By conquest. This is outright robbery.
4. By eminent domain. Again, outright robbery, except the States' own citizens.
5. By actually "working" the land. Still, this does not give a property right. Working land is one requirement for coming into ownership of it. The other requirement is that the tools you use to work it were rightfully yours in the first place. If I steal your plow to work a plot of land, that plot of land isn't legitimately mine. If I enslave you to plow a plot of land, that land isn't legitimately mine. In short, it is impossible for States to homestead land.
Summarily, because no State can ever possibly be legitimate, no State can ever possibly rightfully own (have a property right) in anything. Of course, States positively control things. In the same way, if I hold you up at gunpoint, and steal your money, I positively control it. That doesn't mean I own it or have a normative property right in it.

A monopoly is a grant of special privilege by the State, reserving a certain area of production to one particular individual or group.
This definition of monopoly goes back to the common law and acquired great political importance in England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when an historic struggle took place between libertarians and the Crown over the issue of monopoly as opposed to freedom of production and enterprise. Under this definition of the term, it is not surprising that "monopoly" took on connotations of sinister interest and tyranny in the public mind. The enormous restrictions on production and trade, as well as the establishment by the State of a monopoly caste of favorites, were the objects of vehement attack for several centuries.
This type of monopoly can never arise on a free market, unhampered by State interference. In the free economy, then, according to this definition, there can be no "monopoly problem."

Where do you live? The Socialist Country of Brazil.
Your government does not maintain roads? Only a few.
Our roads.
61.8% of our roads are in these conditions or worse.
No kind of healthcare? We have this, free healthcare for everyone, of course, don't work. Garbage system.
No social support of any kind? We have this too, too expensive.
No one cleans your streets or takes away your trash? Rarely.
No police? Only 5% of assassinations have resolutions. And by resolutions, i do not mean the murder is actually in prison.
How high are those taxes they are stealing from you? More than 77%
Thankfully though, most of us don't live there and are free to move between countries. However by living in a country willingly, you kind of accept whatever rules are applied there by default.
Living on a street owned by the mafia you kind accept the extortion too.
How well would you think society ran if everyone just sat back and leeched hoping someone else would do things for them out of generosity?

Are taxes consistent with individual freedom and property rights?
Are taxes consistent with individual freedom and property rights? Is there a level of taxation where it is no more consistent? Hoppe: Taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. No. Taxes are never, at no level of taxation, consistent with individual freedom and property rights. Taxes are theft. The thieves — the state and its agents and allies — try their very best to conceal this fact, of course, but there is simply no way around it. Obviously, taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. Nor is it possible to construe taxes as normal rent-payments, as they are made by a renter to his landlord. Because the French state is not the landlord of all of France and all Frenchmen. To be the landlord, the French state would have to be able to prove two things: first, that the state, and no one else, owns every inch of France, and second, that it has a rental contract with every single Frenchman concerning the use, and the price for this use, of its property. No state — not the French, not the German, not the US-American or any other state — can prove this. They have no documents to this effect and they cannot present any rental contract. Thus, there is only one conclusion: taxation is theft and robbery by which one segment of the population, the ruling class, enriches itself at the expense of another, the ruled.

How to check if your Electrum Wallet is legit before using.
(For Linux)
Go to Electrum website, click on download, then click on ThomasV, this will redirect you to the MIT website, click on a 7F9470E6, this will redirect you to ThomasV public key, select all and save it as ThomasV.asc.
Go back to Electrum website and download Electrum-3.0.6.tar.gz and its signature Electrum-3.0.6.tar.gz.asc
Copy all the 3 files to the same folder, open the terminal and use command 'cd' to navigate to that folder and run these commands.
gpg --import ThomasV.asc
gpg --verify Electrum-3.0.6.tar.gz.asc Electrum-3.0.6.tar.gz
If the message returned says Good signature and that it was signed by ThomasV with a fingerprint that ends with 7F9470E6, then the software is authentic.

What Is A Full Node?
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.
Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow.

What Is A Full Node?
A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks. Almost all full nodes also help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to further full nodes.
Most full nodes also serve lightweight clients by allowing them to transmit their transactions to the network and by notifying them when a transaction affects their wallet. If not enough nodes perform this function, clients won’t be able to connect through the peer-to-peer network—they’ll have to use centralized services instead.
Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow.

Taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. No. Taxes are never, at no level of taxation, consistent with individual freedom and property rights. Taxes are theft. The thieves — the state and its agents and allies — try their very best to conceal this fact, of course, but there is simply no way around it. Obviously, taxes are not normal, voluntary payments for goods and services, because you are not allowed to stop such payments if you are not satisfied with the product. You are not punished if you do no longer buy Renault cars or Chanel perfume, but you are thrown into jail if you stop paying for government schools or universities or for Mr. Sarkozy and his pomp. Nor is it possible to construe taxes as normal rent-payments, as they are made by a renter to his landlord. Because the French state is not the landlord of all of France and all Frenchmen. To be the landlord, the French state would have to be able to prove two things: first, that the state, and no one else, owns every inch of France, and second, that it has a rental contract with every single Frenchman concerning the use, and the price for this use, of its property. No state — not the French, not the German, not the US-American or any other state — can prove this. They have no documents to this effect and they cannot present any rental contract. Thus, there is only one conclusion: taxation is theft and robbery by which one segment of the population, the ruling class, enriches itself at the expense of another, the ruled.

Mad Max?
Among all the arguments against libertarianism, the funniest and meaningless is Mad Max. It works like this: If we have remove the socialist president, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Education and the Health Mission, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry Education and Human Resources. It would be seen in profane wars, mutually to garner as many human pitfalls as possible.
So, without the State, our morale goes away? I can only speak for myself and say that it is not my certainty. Curiously, the argument is called by the paladins of morality and good attire. If a morality depends on the state, then a dishonesty is not explained. If not, then why delegate a moral vigilance and a fear of being corrected by unscrupulous, petty, lying, jealous and bad-tempered people, that is, by true moral manures? And all those who are in democratic, vulgar amoral terms, who come with enormous talent in a group of followers who adhere to morally disinhibited popular demands, have as main names of non-governmental access and ascending to the top of the command line, and only the presence of confiscate third parties for petty whims - but, of course, all in the name of "social justice" and under the guise of egalitarianism.
Without the government, we will have moral chaos. But how about putting security laws in the hands of the most abominable and deprived of humanity? The result is there, complete moral degeneration and economic crises, by whoever looks at it.
