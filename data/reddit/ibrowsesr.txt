Lol and a few weeks ago you were all **UASF**.
You wake up finally?
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:53:57
So just continuation of goalpost shifting the moment I offer contradictory evidence while never answering any of my questions? I checked your post history and I assure you it is of *great surprise* that it correlates with your inability to generate an independent thought.
So how long have you been in bitcoin??? Afraid to prove your relative inexperience?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:54:44
Then what does that say that makes it a lie?


~~Still waiting going on 7 months of SegWit Official Production Release.~~ Waiting on anything that could tangentially relate them to the word trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:06:08
Then obviously you must not want SegWit right? Because SegWit also increases blocksize. Oh wait that breaks your conspiracy theory narrative because miners can't possibly want something good for Bitcoin right? Oh yeah and big blockers including lead devs aren't USERS who have been wanting this for actual years.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:53:00
True, I remain optimistic though. UASF is shitty enough that this needs to be finished before then :)
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:28:53
Ah batter up! But its a swing and a miss!
or maybe you'd like to provide evidence.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:56:00
Why don't you tell me what has changed in it and its significance.
If you can't answer those questions, please shut the fuck up and never post again unless you want to ask for actual clarification before continuing to pile on misinformation.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:46:47
More propaganda than usual
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:22:57
OP brought to you by redditor for 1 week. Consistent censorship throughout this sub, which I have experienced personally. Maybe you aren't because you don't have a dissenting opinion. But I don't trust Ver or Wu, which is a reason why that current BU is shit and if that was what they were actually pushing I would care, but I can see that Jihan has remained absolutely 100% consistent in his position for the last 2 years. That is demonstrably more trustworthy from the rhetoric that has been shifted by individuals who represent core, especially Luke-Jr. Not to mention he has made it 100% clear that he does not share the same vision on Bitcoin as the I do to the point where I believe his vision is toxic, what is worse is that people actually believe him.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:54:08
well if you stick your head really far up your ass, you can find the mythical idea known as "Chinacoin"
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:47:48


Good joke.


**LukeJr, Peter Todd, Johnson Lau, Cory Fields, and Matt Corallo said they would write SegWit with 2MB hardfork by JULY 2016.**
It has been seen as necessary by anyone with functioning eyes two years ago.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:16:31
So do you not understand how difficulty adjustment works??? If GPUs became viable again it would take literal months of stagnation or a contentious hard fork first. How out of the loop do you have to be to even entertain the thought?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:46:39


So reading is hard?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:06:52
Except the proposed UAHF isn't BU, it is the chain as is with reorg protection, then bigger blocks.  
Except it will most likely be 2MB + SegWit instead.
Except that wasn't even a properly created future and any argument using that metric seriously is an insult to basic intelligence.
Please tell me more.
edit: Some amendments
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:53:22
Sorry but I find this disingenuous seeing as in the HK agreement and well as the NYA it has always been understood that SegWit would be deployed as a soft-fork. Jihan never started signaling for BU until it became extremely clear that Core would not write a proposal with a 2MB base block size increase.
I am continuing to see this over and over, the reason why this is a requirement is because the entire premise of the Big Blocker side is that the average 1.8MB increase by segwit alone is not enough. Even in the original HK agreement, the 2MB was reserved for BASE, even if the block weight is kept at 4MB.
Classic was looking for 2MB immediately, XT for 8, the entire argument has been the expectation of at least 2mb + SegWit's blocksize increase by July 2017. Even if SegWit's release was way behind schedule, I'm pretty sure Antpool signaled Core till early 2017 for months after it.
edit: Literally just searched, they waited until MARCH.
Just because a small portion of miners acts out of bad faith, does not give the devs a free pass to stop acting in good faith themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:17:17
What? There is a literal github with the code on it, with 0 indication of any Emergent Consensus being added on to it.
Do you even know what BU is? Please show me a single shred of evidence of something in Segwit2x that is UNIQUE to BU.
I'll be waiting but my guess is I won't get a reply.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:08:47


/** The maximum allowed size for a serialized block, in bytes (only for buffer size limits) */
static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_SERIALIZED_SIZE = 4000000;
/** The maximum allowed weight for a block, see BIP 141 (network rule) */
static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 4000000;
/** The maximum allowed size for a block excluding witness data, in bytes (network rule) */
static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;
So a hard fork, missing the 2 MB base block size unless I am reading it wrong.
What contributions? You mean spouting the same bullshit we've been hearing for a year and a half? "We need longer to test, we don't need 2MB". Sorry but no one wants to hear your mantra repeated like it will change anything. So what "crucial" feedback was ignored?
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:29:52
Spoiler alert: if you can't get 1/10th the hashing or nodes of just regular SegWit, the economy is definitely not on that side, and it will continue to not be because UASF is a shit idea that can only be matched by BU in terms of garbage fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:29:38
Seeing as I was here before you, I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:03:44


Right except we would be running exactly what was supposed be written after the HK roundtable, except Core didnt write it.
Except we are now running software which requires all users to upgrade or risk their transactions/blocks being orphaned from the "main chain". *Cue scary hardfork attributes*
Damn! Jihan is going to run EXACTLY what he signed up for last year! Really showed him good!
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:34:07
So why did it take so long to write something reasonable...
Because nearly a year and a half ago LukeJr, Peter Todd, Johnson Lau, Cory Fields, and Matt Corallo said they would write this by JULY 2016.




  &gt;2.  The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.  
    3. If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017.
Not arbitrarily determine lack of support with no code written, and then commit to not writing it.
Yet here we are, and its being written by a different team and Jeff Garzik.
Not supporting BIP148 and asking for what was AGREED upon based on the cumulative technical and financial expertise 1 YEAR AGO, is indeed waking up. I'm not asking to bring out the conspiracy theories, I am asking you to reject ideas that are built on the fundamental assumption of a conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:45:33
Sorry but BIP148 was a GUARANTEED chainsplit.
Why? Because when you ask for a protocol that can be put into effect with less than 30% of miners, 30% of users, and 30% of nodes. That has and will always be an advocacy for a chainsplit.
Maybe you're a little bit confused about the "technicalities" but in RELATIONSHIP TO NOW, UAHF is literally vaporware. It only becomes a hard-fork with the activation of a malicious soft fork that threatens with reorganization.
If you were against hard-forks then you would have been against BIP148 in the first place. But the writing has been on the wall for a long time, there will be a hardfork, the question is how contentious do we want it to be.


Miners are key to Bitcoin. You are advocating ignoring an integral part of what allows Bitcoin to function. If you don't believe in miners then why the hell aren't dumping BTC and investing in PoS or PoI, or Tangle.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:29:45
Or you could extrapolate information from my name and realize you can delete things or did I magic comment karma out of thin air. But I mean hey, it's ok you've only followed Bitcoin for way less time, but you're a technical expert right?
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:26:42
So you're ready to change your tune in a few weeks right?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:29:35
So still no argument.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:11:10
Compelling argument. Care to elaborate?
