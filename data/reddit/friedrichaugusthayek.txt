Lehman was not the Canary in the coal mine because it would imply that it was the first failing institution. this so-called "pro free market non-interventionist administration" initiated the tarp program which saved a lot of corporations from Warren Buffett they have been all bailed out like AIG, Goldman Sachs, us bancorp, Bank of America and the population couldn't take another bail out so bailing out Lehman got impossible. the so-called domino effect from failing financial institutions is just a big lie in order to justify this bail out which only benefit the very rich like Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway because when Lehman went bust Barclays just swallowed up the profitable parts and the GAMBLING parts went under. how can you call the Obama administration pro free market non-interventionist they are Democrats and they want to inflate the government as much as possible and intervene into the economy. Warren buffett's Berkshire Hathaway would have lost more than 30% of all of its equities if us bancorp Goldman Sachs Bank of America and us Bank corp went bust do you see that it was a bailout for the super rich? These domino effects are just a giant LIE and it was utilised in Vietnam as well it was said by the US government that if Vietnam becomes communist the entire world becomes communist, Vietnam became communist and the world did not turn communist. the government of the USA just wanted to start a giant war in Vietnam and even fake the Tonkin incident to justify that because governments are so evil. do you see that government is EVIL, all governments are cancer more or less malicious and this is exactly the point why bitcoin was invented, to take governments power away.

Bitcoin is a must buy but not because bitcoin is so great, it's because it's competition is so bad which is Fiat

unfortunately the graph does not show that you get zero interest rate on your deposit while you have to pay 8% on your loan. Plus getting 0% on your deposits you have a real inflation of 4 to 10%. and even though just 50 million people have bitcoin, that's less than 0.8% of the world population. The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed

why does everyone mention bitcoins volatility as a reason not to invest into it? volatility just means fluctuation, upwards or downwards in the short or long run. Fiats steady inflation induced by central banks MONEY PRINTING is terminal decline which means that your holdings in euros, US dollar or whatever know only one long-term direction and that's downwards, that's really bad. Volatility is much better than Inflation.

actually it's not: "not your keys, not your coins" it's "not your key not your coins" because you just need your private key to control the bitcoins. Nicht deine Schlüssel, nicht deine Münzen. But no German says that ever, only the English phrase "not your key, not your coins" is used.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:07:40
this notion that crypto gains are tax free in Germany is just not true, if you want your Krypto gains to be tax free in Germany you need to hold them for more than a year and then they are tax-free not before, so you really need to have them for more than 365 days and then you don't pay taxes.

that Bitcoin is used by criminals shows that it has REAL utility, think about cars the first people who were buying cars were criminals who were doing bank robbery and drove away from the police because the police only had horses and the cars were faster.

So you are saying if you have fundamental conviction it's fun to be down 50% on a regular day, can you explain that. we are in a full-blown economic crisis that you don't see that at the stock market is a by-product of Central banks  pumping the stock market with 80 billion euros and negative interest rates of - 0.4%. why do you think is the fed doing QE forever?

it's so strange, when I didn't own bitcoin I wanted it to go up as soon as possible in order to crush the banking system but since I'm accumulating bitcoin I really want the price to stagnate because I want to have an entire Bitcoin and I'm still not there so I need more time

Boomers love to drive petrol cars the most, so they finance terrorism the most (millennials do that too but have a rather strong tendency of buying electric cars), they erected all the nuclear plants now we have the nuclear waste problem, boomers rather put their savings in gold and gold mining is 3 times as energy-intensive as bitcoin so they destroy here the environment again. what are these decisions which millennials did not think through please elaborate on that one.

@_date: 2019-12-08 13:29:49
A big problem for the environment is gold mining because gold mining is 3x as energy-intensive as keeping bitcoin running and the energy used for mining is in comparison to the energy used for bitcoin not from renewable sources so bitcoin displacing gold would be very good for the environment. And you can buy things with bitcoin from Dell from Microsoft from overstock from everywhere but nobody takes gold

Moon lambo was quite accurate in the long term because it's competition, the euro and US dollar will only go down in value, bitcoin does not need to succeed it's enough if the competition fails and the competition is failing. But how about moon Tesla model 3 because the lambo has not really torque and good acceleration in comparison to Tesla.

the headline of the article should be central bankers instead of elites because elites comprises people who worked very hard for their elite status and therefore deserves their elite status. like Elon musk is an elite he's a billionaire, he is a co-founder of Tesla and shouldn't be compared to Central bankers which is the case if you call all rich people simply elites without further differentiation.

Question, you say nobody really knows the real  worth of a bitcoin can you mention an asset where people really know the real worth? can you explain what speculative investing is because isn't all forms of investment speculative because you trust in the fact that other people don't know the real worth but you do, so for instance the real worth of a stock was $80 and everyone knew it then the price of the stock would be 80 US dollar and no chance of turning a profit anymore because it would have reached its real worth already. You claim, most people stay away from speculative investing, are you sure about this statement? investing in the bond market is speculative investing and the real estate market and the stock market, even if you are holding your money in your bank account you speculate that the bank does not go bust like Lehman Brothers and will not impose cash withdrawal limits like in Cyprus or Iran or Argentina. would you disagree with the assumption that even holding your money in your bank account is speculative? as soon as you hold a single penny of your currency you invested in it because you're holding your value in it. think about people in Venezuela their cash holdings can depreciate 5% plus overnight so they indeed invested in their currencies because they could have just exchanged their Bolivar into US dollar or bitcoin or anything else. My main point regarding bitcoin is, that it has volatility which means it can go up or down, this is fundamentally better than Fiat currencies whichs value can only go down. which currency is more attractive for you? bitcoin which can go up or down or the Venezuelan Bolivar which can only go down. Or the Zimbabwe dollar or the Iranian rial or the Argentine peso or the Sudanese pound, how do you feel about these currencies. these currencies are just more extreme in depreciation through inflation but they have the same problem as the Euro or the US dollar they will all ultimately die, the only difference is they will die faster than the Euro or the US dollar. The average life expectancy of a Fiat currency is 27.5 years. after this average amount of time it ends in hyperinflation or gets for some reason dropped by the population and its worth goes to zero through the network effect.

every store should accept Bitcoin, it's much cheaper than credit card because a credit card transaction eats 5% of your sale. store owners could just give a discount on bitcoin purchases of 2 or 3% then people would surely use bitcoin instead of credit card

Interesting about all these self-proclaimed super sceptics is that they have never ever used Bitcoin. Bitcoin is borderless, permissionless, instant, no weekends or bank holidays, impossible to confiscate, deflationary, no age restriction (like you would have with a bank account), uncorrelated to the rest of the financial system or market and people still claim it's useless and if bitcoin could heal cancer people would claim it's useless.

Danske Bank was recently found guilty of trying to launder 260 billion euros of drug and crime money. So illicit drug sales are bank business too, so yes bitcoin is indeed taking their business. here in Germany bitcoin adoption really goes through the roof, even small apps like lieferando (food delivery service) takes bitcoin. I'm actually eating  pizza and pasta delivered by them, paid for in Bitcoin. The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed.
