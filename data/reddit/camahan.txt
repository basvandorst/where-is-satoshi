The context you used here, makes it really seem like you are in a butt hurt 3rd world country.  If your major way of making change to get what you want is to invest in a flux crypto currency, then you should probably rearrange your priorities.  Just try to get your politicians to push for better banking regulation and better manditory hours. 
You can do almost anything online, PayPal, credit cards are currency as well and you can use your bank/checks to pay that off...  Pretty much anything you can do at a bank you can find a way to do it online, it just takes some work.
I want to love BTC, I really really do...  That said, until more people find their faith in it and countries really all back it, it is useless.

Yeah, it is super easy now a days.  With the invention of the internet and a lot of banks actually adopting the tech it is becoming suprisingly easy to do most things you would have had to go into a bank to do...

Time to get a new bank.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:10:02
They do, just like any other currency the faith behind that currency affects it's trading price/value.  
You are coming off like a hobbyist investor that is really attacky...

Not true, you can in most cases make a transfer from some banks online that will process within no less than 18 hours(Sundays sometimes excluded).  I have made a transfer from my ATM in the US to a bank overseas at about midnight while I was out of state and they approved it within 2 hours.

Cause that frosty is a great investment...  If your bank is that far, switch banks or use their online features to help you do what you need to do.  That or deposit your check in the ATM(assuming you aren't bad in the chex system(i.e. dont bounce checks/go negative in your balance) your bank is likely to give you most if not all of the check same day.  Especially if the source of the check has already been established.

That might not be legal, depending on your [state.](
If it ends up not legal, I would possibly hand that info over to your boss and or just whistle blow if you are in an at will state.
Ninja edit:  You may want to let your boss know that your schedule set by him doesn't allow for proper banking times... (Also all ATMs are required to take check deposits no matter the size, so you can go to the bank and as long as you don't have a record of shorting your bank or bouncing checks they should give you access to almost all of it right away)

Would rather be able to send/receive actual money.  Also can do that through a bank.  Please give actual uses for BTC that most people would use in the real world(so not VPN services or shared rackspace or any telcom anything).

If you are in a country without banking advantages, it is less likely that you will have access to a reputable source that can oversee a transaction between two parties with BTC.  If you do not have access to a bank online, bitch about it to the government, maybe get a petition going.  Or just go during hours of operation/keep cash on you for your transactions and a debit/credit card for the rest.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:23:11
Then complain and ask that they do.  Start a local petition.  Oh look a site that originated in America being complained at by third worlders again... Time to go back to @_date: 2014-04-20 05:59:16
They usually open an hour or two later(so you/they can sleep in) and only close a few hours early...  That is still access to a bank, of which you can still make any nessicary deposits online/at an ATM.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:31:29
Yeah, but in most cases you have to go through a 3rd party to even make use of the BTC to exchange it to useable money...  This still requires normal banking hours in almost all cases.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:07:27
To exchange BTC for cash you have to go through a 3rd party medium(if you want to be 100% safe).  Those 3rd parties can take a lot of your money compairably.  Also if you are investing when BTC traded high, it doesn't have the same stability of other federal currencies.(Especially with bad PR around harder mining times ahead, and a giant portion of the BTC currency being held by one entity)

There is unfortunatly.  There are some business still cash only, as they are pretty anti credit card/bank card as there are fees that in some states cannot be passed to the customer.  
That said, I would take any business I can get ever as a business owner.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:27:48
Usually due to good credit and a good history in chexsystems.  That or the bank knows the check that it is coming from and they can preprocess it without the credit.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:25:56
How many billions of people don't have access to the internet?  How many billions of people will be forced to go through less than reputible 3rd parties to do their BTC transactions for mostly stuff that isn't food/utilities?
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:26:58
Then you have a bad credit/chexsystem history.  It means that you probably went negative and or bounced a few too many checks.  I would ask your banker to give you ways to improve that.(they are legally obligated to do so in the US)
