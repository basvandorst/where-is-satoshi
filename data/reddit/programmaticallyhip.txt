The worst thing about this dip is that it's going to affect Roger Ver's ability to feed imaginary starving children in Venezuela.

Anyone who doesn't see that engagement with crypto has fallen off a cliff is willfully blind. Half of these new Reddit subscribers are shill accounts, and new shitcoin projects proliferate every day. Bitcoin went mainstream, then it went tits up and burned a ton of new investors. Now it's basically a meme in the eyes of the non-crypto world.
We're not seeing another bull market without significant real world adoption or some kind of black swan event in world finance.
