in 2017 bitmex made around $2.20 revenue per Second. Not sure about them today, since not much numbers are known.

Best in my opinion: Invest 10% of your monthly earnings into bitcoin. Thats it. Don't risk much but still have earnings. Never risk any amount that you can't afford.

i also think that there are many "bad coins" without a team behind it and supporters. flooding the market. yes. But some coins like supernet / ripple / nxt / opal / banx are really innovative and those are creating a whole new market system. One day it will be the stockmarket 2.0 i think. This is my opinion.

Ok - we are working hard to get better. You will see results. :)
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:45:59
yea we ask for bitcoin, would be awesome though if the other coins would be accepted also. but main factor is bitcoin.

Ok thanks for your opinion - We will add more information within 24 hours. You're totally right - this is also our first crowdfunding project - so we will improve over time. People like you help us to advance! Thanks alot.

yes I am no movie producer - thats - when you would have read the campaign - is to get the ball rolling into hollywood. I am not going to make the movie myself, we will hire people to do so, thats the reason for the high amount of money we need, also the money is needed for REAL actors, camera, set, and more. I am the writer of the story - and at this point, we can not supply you with more information about the project. You dont need to support if you dont want to, but if you do, you will see that it helped us to provide a really good movie in the cinemas about bitcoins.

Well its huge tbh, Digistore is the Amazon of Switzerland since there is no Amazon in Switzerland. All people of Switzerland know Digistore and it will bring a lot of adoption to crypto.

Thats nice, I only knew that Ernst and Young had Crypto ATM's in their buildings in Switzerland.

I was about betting on clinton back at Presidential election. But my stomach told me I should just do the opposit. So I bet that Trump will win with 2k$. It was a 10:1 at that time against trump.
So yea, I made 20k. Pretty darn lucky day, back then.
And you know what I did buy from that? I am sure you know :)
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:02:06

PBoC: Damn BTC price is raising again. We should ban it.
P: You already banned it.
PBoC: Then let's unban it, so we can ban it again.

I could easily imagine a situation where btc reaches a new ath by the end of 2019. And tbh, the things that happened this week plus bakkt what is coming very soon makes me even more optimistic on this.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:01:31
Insert "thank you" gif. I don't get it why some people think its that easy to "buy them all" with cash.
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:03:39
