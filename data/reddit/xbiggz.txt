I use QuadrigaCX. Takes a stupid amount of time to verify you but it has been really good to me.

Waiting for a dip so I can go swimming. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:54:43
Early Boxing day sale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:44:40
Where are the people that begged for this dip to come....
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:19:41
Upvoted because I'm Canadian and Canadians are supposed to be nice
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:54
I'm shocked you held this long.. you should have cut your losses yesterday..
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:12:30
It's funny to say that if you disconnected yourself for about 24 hours that it wouldn't have induced any panic selling 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:41:57
Buy high sell low said the great Investors
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:50:25
Welp 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:47:51
Sounds like a lot of butthurt... directly attacking millennials 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:54:29
Thank you man. About to go max out my credit cards brb
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:22:56
I'd rather invest in dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:02
Aren't you? I say 100k as well
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:43:10
Hodl on man
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:34:34
This is awesome. I love coffee
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:09
More like a few minutes. People flip over the price spikes, quick to say "I told you its gonna crash!" "I'm not trading my money for fake internet money" It's been shifting $1000s the past 24 hours and the true HODLers haven't batted an eye.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:03:26
Hot take: 30k by new years
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:25:00
I have an off the boat Chinese friend that has more punctuality then me..
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:16:17
CONFIRMED: BTC is a scam. Panic sell time
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:32:00
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:09:00
I'm also known as the bitcoin guy at work, funny how a few months ago that was a bad thing to the public eye
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:40:33
$7k+, less then $3 in fee as well beginning of december.. took 2.5 days.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:50:42
That moment when a $5000 (canadian) dip excites you. I work in 5 hours i'm sitting here in my boxers buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:15:31
Another 5 years from now it will be:
I wish I kept my 0.0001 BTC @ $120,000 instead of selling them at $190,000, now that its $1,000,000!

Doubled his investment so fast he hasn't finished his coffee yet
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:53
2 motives, 1 is to pay off my debts, the second is to ride this thing out to the moon with the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:10:41
Just hodl on were coming home
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:16:32
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:41:42
But we still don't know what he looks like..
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:37:35
Nobody knows what I do outside of working my job, especially about my crypto. The last people I would ever tell is my family. The only people that do are my SO, and my one cousin and friend that we all bought in together. We HODL together we die together
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:04:58
Good for you, where i'm from selling 1.2 btc will pay off 10 months worth of rent at best..
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:57:45
I remember when I told my friend Bitcoin will be worth 10k by Christmas..... boy was I wrong.

That pic is so unrealistic. I dont think the flag would be flying that way

Roger would be a great car salesman. “This isn’t a used car sir it’s lightly loved” 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:21:34
I’m not taking this with a grain of salt I’m taking this to the bank!!
