You should take the bitcoin and give her cash.

There are fewer purchases until people can afford what they want.  When I can afford a Lambo I'm getting a Lambo.  
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:30:24
But how very likely is that?  I'm sure there's that one guy who is going to go through the trouble of setting up two wallets.  Then running between two different hot dog carts to buy a second hot dog.  Really though there is only so many hotdogs you can eat.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:50:52
That's what I think.  
@_date: 2018-05-10 02:14:12
I don't think we should say that it's easy.  How many times do we have to tell people not to do exactly what this person did?  
These are really early adopters right?  Because otherwise why would they have a copies of the keys themselves.  
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:53:01
Having one central point of failure for multiple large institutions is just asking for it.  I can't wait till these fuckers lose all their bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:55:50
Thanks for the million bitcoin idea.  Now where to find thin sturdy metal?
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:40:29
Yeah maybe they think they seized his bitcoin.

When was the first AI built and what generation are you?
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:42:04
Maybe it's like a bonus deal.  Buy the BTC get the BCH for free.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:03:39
Couldn't you just do it through QR codes.  As long as the merchant has internet it doesn't really matter if the customer does.  Let's say you're a hot dog vendor and you also don't have an internet connection while your out selling.  It would be safe enough to sell your dogs without confirmation until you got back home and connected online.  80/20 principle.

Thanks to the president I don't think North Korea will end up at the end of the curve like that.

Holy crap it's under $9000! 
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:41:17
Could of been the 8000BTC moved from the MTGox cold storage.  Maybe the article of the crypto vaults the rich are using.
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:45:13
I have a bimonthly dca buy of $5.  So that would be great.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:45:54
Was there really a large panic sell?  It never even crossed my mind to sell.  I'm hodling till I can buy a house.  
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:38:42
Why are any bitcoins being seized from these hackers?  Do they have their Electrum Wallet passwords on a sticky note stuck to the monitor.  If I had that many bitcoin I would have the seed memorized.  
@_date: 2018-05-10 21:27:18
That's not cool.  You're going to make him sell.  Then when it goes back up he'll really hate you.    
@_date: 2018-05-16 19:51:50
The internet also deserves free speech.  So why are you blocking it twitter?  
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:47:14
That doesn't make any sense.  That would be the best way to launder all those bitcoin he stole.
@_date: 2014-07-21 11:10:07
Help me understand what a good password is.  If I go to a website like carbonwallet.com and get a 4 word string that it generates, is that a good password?  From reading this  it seems like a good password.    Does anyone know how many words carbonwallet pulls from to create it's 12 word strings?  Is it alright if I don't capitalize and use non letter characters?  
So how do you guys create passwords for your wallets?  How many characters long is it?  
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:25:55
Bitcoin will probably destroy all non first world currencies. That we will definitely see.  In the first world Bitcoin will probably take over for gold as a store of value and hedge against inflation.  Using fiat is just too easy and we'll just continue too use it as everyday currency.  That's just what I think will happen in our lifetimes.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:41:32
Wait a second?  Why are you guys down on this idea?  Wouldn't issuing Walcoin basically be like issuing stock?  Why is that a bad idea?
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:25:00
Why would anyone even use Freewallet?  I have a hard time feeling sorry for these people.  I shouldn't but I just can't imagine how anyone got to the point where they were going to choose a wallet and somehow missed all the warnings the community puts out.  Didn't you watch a million Andreas videos saying not your keys not your bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-08 09:43:04
So how likely is it that the DFS will just ignore the constitution and go ahead anyways?
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:44:01
Wow is it free to download?  I was waiting to buy it off of Amazon in October.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:53:50
Stay positive.  You're way ahead of the game since you payed off your student loans.  At least you got that out of the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:06:30
What kind of book is  Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos going to be?  I want to read something that is a good overview of Bitcoin.  Is that what this will be or is it some sort of technical manual?
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:33:40
Will Capital One close my account if I buy bitcoin from Coinbase?  I was about to.
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:59:50
I really hope this succeeds.  What is described in the article, getting bitcoin into the hands of the unbanked is what will really make bitcoin succeed.  We might think of ourselves as being late to the bitcoin game but it really hasn't even gotten started.
@_date: 2014-08-01 13:21:07
It sounds like his mom thinks he's too dumb to have done it.  
@_date: 2014-07-12 09:47:49
Caught in a landslide
@_date: 2014-08-11 10:27:55
Yeah that's my strategy.
@_date: 2014-08-18 11:54:42
I asked this last Monday but no one answered it.  What kind of book is Andreas Antonopolus new book going to be?  Is it going to be some kind of technical book or will it be a good overview of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:22:18
Does satoshis.place accept BCH?  It seems like a lot of the art is either for/against or about BCH vs. BTC.  Maybe put a bar on the side showing how much of each has been spent. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:57:05
You can trace what addresses it went to but that doesn't do anyone any good.  That doesn't tell you who took it or where in the actual world it went.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:32:50
That's a good point.  Let's say you are buying a house.  Makes sense to include a larger fee for some piece of mind.  
@_date: 2019-11-07 23:42:24
Maybe Stefan will start talking about Bitcoin again.  Ah the good old days before the SJWs came and ruined it all.
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:12:21
The only reason to use blockchain is if you are going to decentralize.  I doubt one of China's standards will be "Decentralization".  
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:25:06
We just need Bitcoins market cap to increase so that it can entirely subsume smaller third world currencies.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:27:44
What part of infinite divisibility do you not understand?

That's a very good interview.  It goes over a lot of misconceptions people have.

"I'm all in Jerry!"
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:03:47
It might be more of wallet problem.  What kind of phones are most people running around with?  If the general public hasn't upgraded to smart phones than it's a problem.  Then you have to offer a wallet that's simple enough to use without having to know much about how bitcoin actually works.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:55:11
I always come into these threads to keep myself aware of scams but I'm repeatedly disappointed.  People should instead title these threads I just did something really dumb.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:41:45
Did you transfer btc from a gambling site or something like that?  I think it's the law that keeps them from replying to you so it just seems like they have bad customer service.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:27:10
Just remember that all the people telling you that Bitcoin is dead are the people who get their knowledge from watching cable news shows.  The lower Bitcoin goes the more you should want to buy it.  The only thing that can stop Bitcoin is thermonuclear world war.  
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:07:29
This is everyone on r/buttcoin who think bitcoin can be stopped.  
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:27:20
The hacker didn't hack bitcoin.  The hacker hacked the exchange where the bitcoin was kept and yes the hacker took the bitcoin and moved it into his own wallet.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:15:34
What will happen is bitcoin becomes more valuable and you divide it into smaller units.  
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:53:53
It would be really hilarious if they did implement it just to fuck with them.  
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:09:28
Yes, that’s why I’m happy it’s going down.   Some people have already done most of their accumulating so they are sad at the lower price.
@_date: 2018-03-28 05:29:20
If you read the article it’s written like Venezuela isn’t actively imploding.  
@_date: 2018-07-11 08:44:21
Nope.  It's going to be the third world that adopts bitcoin first. Then it's going to be a nasty fight but it will be to late for fiat.

Under Limited supply explain how "More will be printed when necessary is not a positive."

Andreas A. says it's inevitable that Coinbase will get hacked.  What do you guys think?
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:21:44
I'm starting to agree with McAfee.  There is this psychological need to have an entire bitcoin.  Imagine when every millionaire out there wants one full bitcoin for his own.  Million dollar bitcoin here we come.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:45:21
I've heard it's a bad idea to try to be clever like that by transposing words.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:28:05
So was there any bitcoin on that seed?
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:16:06
So I got a Trezor wallet and moved my bitcoin to addresses controlled by keys in my Trezor.  I was using an Electrum wallet on my computer and have been paranoid about getting hacked for a while now.  
So now I don't have to worry about getting hacked?  Now I just worry about losing my pin and seed right?  Any advice on this.  How hard is it to remember a 24 word seed?
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:30:22
I finally got a Trezor wallet.  It feels so good not having to be paranoid about getting hacked.  
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:09:11
Should you use a new address every time you receive bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:44:09
Well do you think most people even bother to memorize it?  What I was planning to do is give the copy of the seed to my sister for safe keeping but what if her house burns down or she somehow loses it.  How many copies of your seed are there and did you memorize the seed?   
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:50:30
Wow that's pretty cool.  That'll survive a fire.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:54:32
Let's see, I have point uhh.  Yeah I don't even know how much bitcoin I have.
