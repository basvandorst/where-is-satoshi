I'd check the addresses it displays in an explorer. I've downloaded the blockchain a few times and sometimes it just changes the amount in the end for some reason.

It might be difficult to default on debt. This might realize the old libertarian dream of bringing back indentured slaves.

I think there's another sub for mining, but bitcoin is sha256 not scrypt.

I hope so, but I suspect this is the impression of many.

This myth of inevitability is really something..
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:11:05
When you buy bitcoin it's on chain. Why would anyone spend the fees to get it on lightning when there's nothing to do with it there (except wash your coins) and you have to get it back on chain before your node goes offline?
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:55:59
Keep clinging on futilely?
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:33:44
It seems like the myth of inevitability is the only thing that keeps bitcoin going these days.

I bet you can calculate what the price would be if we took the current buy side and corrected for a decreased supply from the halving, and that this wouldn't the huge effect it has had. It's just a signal to start the pump. But then it doesn't make sense to talk about whether it's priced in. But I'm not gonna actually do the calculation either.

You're just proving my point. People will buy those vehicles for other reasons (practicality, price), and then the brands will all gradually change the ToS for more and more control and people will just get used to it. They can compensate for badwill with advertisement. There won't be an alternative because they'll all be in on it, and if there somehow would show up a sane alternative, they'd just buy it up, sue them to death, epstein their leadership, make sure banks don't cooperate with them, or whatever. First you implied that the market would save us from ToS-tyranny, but now "the market" is an authority argument. "The market" could enforce universal indenture chattel slavery, and libertarians would say that it's good because it's the providence of the Invisible Hand.
I'm not unprincipled. It's just that there are obligations apart from contracts.

Autonomous vehicles will inevitably put demands on where and how you're traveling in terms of services. Not your keys not your bitcoin. If you don't drive somebody else is. His cars aren't autonomous yet, but they have tight control over things like who gets to use their power stations.
Elon Musk is a villain. You're just buying it because of the buzzwords.
