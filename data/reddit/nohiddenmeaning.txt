The only right answer after publicly finding several hundert btc on a forgotten wallet...

But he's wrong in saying your crypto currency is in your wallet. It's in the blockchain.

Please don't.

Love that village!

If I saw this and didnt have cash I would not feel good buying there at all and go someplace else.

It lists the current price at 8850 $. But non of the sell-offers are even close to that. The are at 8250$, which is the price at most otherwise exchange. Sth seems very off.

Why wouldn't everyone participate who waits to buy at 600, why is this only "easy money for big whales"?

I admit that's hearsay on my part. I don't want to spread info if it's incorrect. Let me see where the source was..

Dankeschön. You wouldn't happen to know why they also have crazy spikes in their charts, putting the high at 13k€ this week for example..?

Jesus, reading this you make me constantly sheathe and unseathe my pitchfork. Make up our minds whether to condem a random stranger or not.

I think it's where Bitfinex stores their customers coins.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:58:14
Stupid question: are those fees for buying/selling or for sending btc from one wallet to another?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:33:46
"lot of complications", "needs to be sorted out"
- this supports my sneaking suspicion that noone actually knows shit about what's going to happen.

Can you maybe by deduction (other passwords from that time) piece together the LastPass parameters for your password (lenght, special characters y/n) to give the password breaking service more to work with? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:39:53
That's just scary.

His wallet is known and it's the second largest currently in existance. If I remember correctly it's about six-figure bitcoins in there. 
*edit:  as u/PVmining pointed out, Satoshi's wallet is a hypothesis (but going even into the seven figure range). [Here is some further reading on the subject](
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:48:07
A 500€ / 600$ spread at the biggest German exchange? Plus non of the sell-offers (is that what you call them) are even close. I'll gladly take this to r/bitcoinbeginners but I really thought sth was fishy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:31:24
Owning Bitcoin and a desire to be "safe" is really a bit contradictory.

Where in Munich?

This was such a close call. To think in a few years that only 39 people upvoted this...

What's your secret u/macburger? Why do they get your sarcasm but not mine? I thought 'government' was at least as over the top as pope.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:38:56
The government

Can we make this answer the sidebar text for this sub please?
Seriously, I would gild you if I had money left.

Delighted to hear. I'll let my fellow Europeans know. 
And while I have your ear, if you want to expand on your USP, maybe there is a way to allow import of Excel data (most exchanges let you export those), so you don't have to integrate all those APIs. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:11:04
Country/Provider? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:54:54
Import is what sets it apart from most mainstream alternatives.
