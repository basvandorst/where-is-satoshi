Exodus has quite a large exchange fee I think so not the best option...

I just want to stress to anyone reading this, do not use HITBTC since signing up last night and sending tokens over its locked me out twice for "suspicious activity", (I haven't even traded on there, just sent funds...)
 If it's not telling me i'm locked out, it's throwing up 502 errors saying "bad gateway". Best avoided, anyone with funds in there I urge you to pull out.

IN potential scam news **HITBTC** the dodgy motherfuckers that they are have halted all withdrawals ( except for XRP which brings up a different question... )
They say its due to "tech maintenance" but they still accept deposits and trading without mentioning the incapacity to withdraw. 
Are they legit? Are they trying to pump XRP by allowing transactions and withdrawal solely thought ripple?

in terms of short-term trading (tried it today for the first time, between ETH and BTC, selling the latter for the former...) what should one do in anticipation for tomorrow? 
Kinda wanted to ride out any potential crash with ETH and swap back after but i'm worried that BTC will rocket and i'll miss the train. I know things aren't set in stone in these ventures but is there anyone here with some fairly solid idea of what will happen tomorrow?

good talk bud.

A pretty sweeping statement, but I'm not actually an analyst at all, so you got it right this once. I'm relaying TA from Twitter etc. While TA is sometimes a little hit and miss, you can't deny the behavioral psychology behind market trends.

I'll take that as your way of saying that you don't contribute anything but negativity.

Oh did you watch it? Or are you judging based off nothing? These are opinions by traders and analysts, nothing more.
Also really good to see that your last 4 comments are judging video as "trash" wheres your content mate?
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:11:36
I'm mainly interested in who/what hurt you enough to judge a video you haven't watched. I'm guessing you got badly burnt during 2018... Shouldn't have bought the top bud.

A particularly bullish fart it seems 
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:10:01
And your contribution to anything productive? 
Answer: fuck all

Pretty cynical view. Also its very difficult to make money from Youtube these days. The point of this video was to ask random people on the street if questions were asked here it wouldn't really be representative of the people at large.
