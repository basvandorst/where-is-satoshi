You ordered bumper stickers?
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:01:21
Whoever made this website did a good job with it
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:20:58
Um ok, what do you want us to do?
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:24:37
Yeah i was one of those people deciding if i should buy or not
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:32:57
Beutiful piece of art
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:58:24
But..then how will you reproduce?
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:53:15
I dont get it, is he supporting bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:37:21
Trump coin
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:03:10
Good analysis
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:00:34
who is chamath palapapala?
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:13:25
So we’ve narrowed it to either Texan or Asian.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:18:27
Some people gave taken it seriously tho
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:51:12
I hope so too
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:46:57
He also can’t spell jalapenos, that would be strange for someone born in CA.
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:46:18
Asians like spicy and they use weird combos all the time, he seems to be most likely Asian. I can’t imagine Hal or pasty szabo eating jalapenos.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:54:01
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:59:22
Well you had like 4 months too buy
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:23:33
And that he might be from CA, they like pineapples on pizza right?
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:16:54
I saw someone driving a lambo in chicago and you could hear its engine but there was a stoplight on each block so it couldnt even go fast.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:01:29
He doesn’t know how to buy it
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:50:05
This should be the headline
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:01:16
No that isn’t the truth, no one knows for sure what will happen
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:47:11
Buy the dump
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:20:55
Maybe roger advised him
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:55:10
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:46:51
If you bought the dump you might have bought them too
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:12:08
I bought some gox coins
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:40:28
This is one of my fears, 
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:27:37
Yeah we know
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:40:41
Most likely kraken, they already admitted knowing about it
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:11:28
What the? Is it good or bad
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:14:21
Feels like no matter what you do can never get ahead because of taxes, its my largest expense by far
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:03:11
Good luck with that, you think the irs would give a refund?
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:08:27
Pepperidge farm always remembers
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:20:10
the name sounds really close to rob a bank
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:09:36
I dont want to hear the word trump
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:11:58
I got sick of all the trump talk
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:50:46
The only thing that can top this is satoshi coins
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:54:18
Winklevii agrees
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:45:54
I bought around 7k, and will add under 10k. I think we could hit 35k this year. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:56:45
When will the pain be over?
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:58:32
Mark karpes strikes again
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:53:47
Look what happened to charlie shrem and ross ulbricht
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:29:47
I stopped watching most late night, cant take it anymore
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:50:49
We have at least a month or two of consolidation/ accumulation.  If you want to buy, this is the chance anytime it goes below 10k
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:21:35
Hey dad, long time no see.
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:39:00
This deserves a piece of chocolate (eaten by me)
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:53:55
Are you buying the gox?
@_date: 2018-03-08 12:53:58
Change.org him
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:06:29
No just sick of hearing about him
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:47:28
Not to mention the largest employer for H1Bs
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:19:52
Too late, i bought it
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:38:31
Sailing around the world is dangerous. I watched the entire series of ‘i shouldnt have lived’ on amazon and there were quite a lot of sailing ones.

There is another ETF application posted here with mostly negative comments: 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:41:02
I bought few days ago
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:10:46
Is it ok if i put my name as pumpkin pie?
@_date: 2018-07-28 09:48:12
Maybe they mean the exchanges?
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:00:00
Good work
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:48:53
You eat it
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:14:23
oh. so there's no need to worry.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:35:05
Well to be fair i think the sec was right in rejecting the winklevii etf because of potential for manipulation.
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:41:48
Definitely an inverse bart
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:25:43
No comment
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:08:37
You can also submit online, you just have to find the rule in proposed rules

God i wish for a bull market again, i miss those days dreaming about retiring
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:31:47
They got squished

Why would anyone want to learn crypto from glenn beck?
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:16:41
This application had been rejected 3 times already, but the difference this time is that they secured insurance for investors in case of a hack. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:34:43
I hope so
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:07:25
Post chapelle
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:05:43
Well why dont you write it in a comment
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:06:25
Is it gappening again?
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:15:02
lol those were the exciting days
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:14:10
@_date: 2018-07-20 00:15:29
How old are you
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:42:47
But the internet isnt a currency. I think you’re confused with ethereum.
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:24:18
Well i already posted but theres a backlog of comments so still waiting
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:14:12
Geez how many posts fo we need about this
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:02:34
Ok thanks, what a pain this is.
@_date: 2018-04-26 09:13:38
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:09:32
Who did that, is it a whale pump?
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:01:52
Why dont they outsource to india?
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:48:27
You mean the average Raj. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:21:57
Thanks just checking.
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:50:54
I think the parabolic move up and down was to screw the retail investors. Most of them bought right before or during the move up and got scared when it dropped and exited.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:43:47
But. I just updated to 1.4.1 yesterday.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:43:17
but the cost of living in India is so low that a McDonald's salary would probably be more than enough for them.
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:02:43
Best to buy from ledger directly, free shipping from Paris, came in a few days, I wish they sent macaroons with it
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:17:10
Hello, can you see this post please respond.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:22:02
Who asked you to?
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:11:05
The whale might take a dump soon
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:24:12
Maybe you had some weird transactions
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:32:18
This coolest piece i’ve seen for btc
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:59:26
No one noticed though
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:19:30
imagine logging into td ameritrade or fidelity and being able to buy a crypto etf without signing up for coinbase or buying a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:37:15
Oh snap what did you do, it was a bart
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:21:03
With so many people in the U.S you would think our taxes would be lower like couple hundred dollars, but no they always find a way to use our money.
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:16:37
I do know that price will suddenly go up then take a massive dump
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:59:48
oops, I forgot they're macarons.
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:40:43
Its 50/50 chance of being right

I cant wait, been hodling forever
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:30:55
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:35:40
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:19:34
I live in chicago, had no idea this was going on
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:10:30
We’re in ethtrader
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:34:22
Yes, lets keep an open mind.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:50:48
Do you know something about estimated tax?
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:41:34
Its for a different etf ruling posted bt cboe (granite shares)
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:08:17
Is it bad or good?
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:40:53
I’d like to actually use something instead of just hodling
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:50:42
Hes not satoshi what does he know?
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:25:37
Who is this guy?

Can i give a large gift to myself or family nember?
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:43:44

@_date: 2018-04-25 01:21:17
Everyone in r/cryptocurrency should apply

He called us ‘bitcoin freaks’. He’s the freak.
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:54:08
Isnt’t it just digital form of money then. Why compare to the internet when it’s closer to a dollar than the internet.
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:48:14
I have never used TA or charts and i managed to but a boatload at the botttom just because i had this feeling that this is the lowest i’ve seen it and i should get in.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:19:15
I feel like i might have missed something with estimated taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:34:45
I can't believe it's happening again. I can finally look at my blockfolio and coin prices.  I forgot what all the coin prices were.
