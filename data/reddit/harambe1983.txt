But arent they all made in china? Also miner price/efficiency dont matter much (they will both compete for that and will be about the same eventually) what makes mining very profitable in china is the electricity cost. Unless the world electricity cost the same, decentralization of mining will be tough

Does this really work? And how much money is he making? 1 cent?

My point is. They will compete using the same chip. They open each other machine and come up with a little advancement. Its what technology rivalry has been. Buying from bitmain or its competitor will depending on the time you buy gives you that slight efficiency only to be overthrown by another product with slighter better efficiency.

But he is making 1 cent per trigger. That much effort for $1 after 100 trigger

I dont know why you would compare fb to btc. What is fb inventing now? Netflix/amazon would probably makes more sense since amazon just bought wholefood and possibly go to pharmacy business as well... and the fact if amazon decide to adopt crypto as payment

Cash is linked to criminal activity... every single dollar bill have a trace of heroine. You also use cash to pay for illegal prostitue, guns etc more than cryptos. You also most likely to get killed carrying cash

Aside from chinas cheaper electricity? All computer parts (chips, boards) are still made in china. Iphones are made in china. Unless there is somewhere in US where manufacturer can produce pc parts cheaper than china (which US wont) and pay labor of $2.50 per hour (which US wont) ... then china have the upperhand in all sector. If you google who will be economical super power in 10 years, china is no1 (in terms of economical growth is most sectors) not just mining. There is more millionaires (in usd worth) than the whole earth combined and its increasing everyday. If you see the house market, there are many chinese buyers buying houses in cash in US and canada.
