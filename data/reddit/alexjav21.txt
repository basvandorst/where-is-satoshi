Imo, Speculators are hampering its natural rate of growth, leading to large boom and bust cycles and exhorbetent fees. 
But since i've grown out of my dnm phase and started using it primarily for speculation as well, i'm in no position to judge..

I understand that the freedoms bitcoin provide make it useful for an anarcho-capital society, but is there reasons it could not also be used in a socially democratic state?
Edit: tax avoidance i guess.. i feel somewhat conflicted as a left leaning bitcoin supporter.

Maybe not in the short term. And maybe not due to bitcoin. But I think people are starting to understand that a currency that *isn't* backed by gold (or anything asset) is just as arbitrary as a Cryptocurrency. 
Both of them are heavily reliant on group psychology determining that they are worth something. It's not ridiculous to think that in a world where everybody has a smartphone, that we could just trade using QR codes and private wallets in a decentralized system.

I've been thinking of something like this. Wish I had the crypto knowledge to implement. When i told my dad about it the first thing he said is "how would you monetize that?" I was just like "that's not really the point.."

I've been using bitcoin since it was in triple digits. I don't know the future, but given the trends, I think you'll be fine.

I own 1 tether. I was hoping it would moon like bitcoin did last fall, but atleast it's held steady.
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:17:42
Maybe another way of interpreting it would be; if bitcoin were to replace the dollar, 1 bitcoin would have roughly the buying power of $213,000 today.

Just so you know, theres left reasons for liking bitcoin too. Disdain for  big, often unaccountable banks being a big one for me.
I think it's better described as more fundamentally libertarian than right wing.

It's not like i'm saying BTC is gonna die, I'm just saying people with larger stakes in bitcoin look for these sharp increases to take a profit. I'd guess there will be some sort of correction in the next couple days, before raising again to its the current price over the course of a week or two. 
Or maybe the roller coaster only goes up from here, who really knows..
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:24:09
Hopefully neither ��‍♂️
Keep your savings more diversified then that
Edit: also, people who aren't tech savvy are intimidated by bitcoin. If Facebook can control the entire user experience, they will be able to reach those people better than bitcoin can.

True, the next pump might never come, so I probly won't have the balls next time either. 
and maybe I'm wrong and it's a more clever con.. pump so many times that it seems routine... then we buy his shitcoin low by the boatload expecting a pump that never comes. and really all we've done is give him our bitcoin.
