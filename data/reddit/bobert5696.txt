Why? That seems like an excessive amount of work for a questionable benefit.

You're going to need some proof that quark coin looks promising to make that argument.

Keep in mind that 100 BC was worth 1/10th of what it is now, so while a bad idea, not quite to the same magnitude

Can you provide a link? There is a new helium filled 6 TB drive that has been unveiled by Western Digital, but it's not released and there is still not ETA on a release. However it will be pretty much exclusivley a commercial DC drive, as the $/GB will be significantly higher, so the only point of it would be to get more storage out of a server rack. A home consumer will probably be able to buy 2 4TB drives for the price when it is released.

"In criminal law, fraud is intentional deception made for personal gain or to damage another individual; the related adjective is fraudulent" (wikipedia)
If they are mining them before shipping and purposefully delaying orders, then yes, it is fraid, AFAIK, this has never been confirmed (only speculated).
If it is simply incompetence, then it is not fraud.

That looks perfect! I've never used python before, but I've been trying to find a project to learn it with for a while now so here goes

How? The spread hasn't been that wide moving upwards, fees would kill any profit...

I don't know if I believe a $250,000 transfer went through without a confirmation. Hell, I can't transfer more than $5,000 online per day from any of my bank accounts, US Bank, BoA, or wells fargo.

How else did you think it would go down? It's called LOCAL for a reason. I've done hundreds of transactions meeting all sorts of people. Never a single issue.


No surprise you had issues there. It is a dieing company.


 Any fraudulent activity a quick call to your bank will take care of. They just got $25 million in funding, they aren't going to steal from you as proving it would be very easy and they would go out of business very fast.


Localbitcoin or coinbase.

I just wanted to comment and say you have some very impressive designs, keep up the good work!

I was looking at minute by minute resolution, which is around 600 gb a year, which isn't a LOT, but for a pet project, way more than a $5 / month server can handle.

It is very unlikely hardrives will be 6-8 TB in 2 years, possibly even 5+, we are reaching the point where we have maxed out density, maxed out the number of platters we stick in a single drive, and additional increases are just very unstable.
That being said 300 GB of a 3 TB hardrive is still only 10%... And there is no reason you can only have one harddrive in most situations... Especially if you are the kind of person who is worried about having the 2.7 TB of data taking up the rest of the initial 3 TB

Personally, I wouldn't be too concerned, as long as you are smart about it. There is virtually no reason to store money in your account, so you buy coins, transfer them to your own wallet, and boom, you're done. If there are any fraudulent transactions on the account and coinbase won't reverse them, a quick call to your bank surely will get them reversed.
There really isn't a good competitor to coinbase in terms of exchanging fiat for BC, so while it has had its issues, at least for me, it's not a huge concern.
tl;dr: Transfer coins out of coinbase after purchase and you are (nearly) completely safe.


25 million

You're example while related, is significantly different.
A more applicable example: a thief steals your gold ring worth $100. He sells it to a jewler who sends it off to a smelter who mixes it with $1,000,000 worth of other gold, and then you go after the smelter for your $100. That, seems quite a bit more ridiculous.

The orders aren't hidden, you just don't leave an open order on the book for the world to see. When whatever conditions the buyer has set are met (price drops below 110 for ex) then the trade bot instigates a trade, but not until that happens

Having dealt with paypal extensively, I know exactly what you are talking about, I despise that company more than just about every other company out there. HOWEVER, you and I are in the minority. No matter how YOU or I feel about PayPal's reputation, among the general public, they have a pretty fantastic reputation, because it is rare that a buyer (the VAST majority of paypal users) get screwed, rather the seller.

He was implying (at least the way I read it) that he made 3 BC tonight trading, not over the course of the last week.

I am currently working on a platform for data analysis among all of the exchanges. I'm just starting to look at how I want to implement the order book. There are a couple of big problems I am running into:
It is a LOT of data. The entire transaction history for mt gox is around 500 mb (and compressed to 90). A full order book history will be a few orders of magnitude larger than this. Though just storing changes to the order book and not values itself, and then calculating it in real time would save a lot of space, it still would be at least a few gigabytes.
The harder problem, is the historic data. Unlike transaction history, the API doesn't provide historic trade depth data. So I only would be able to use it in analyses from whenever I got to tracking it onward, and if the server ever went down, I wouldn't have data from that period.
So I'm/probably others are working on it, there are just a few big hurdles on where there already isn't something like it out there.
