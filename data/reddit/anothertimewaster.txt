I find myself checking this subreddit very rarely now, and other BTC related ones daily. I'm assuming others do the same.

They moved to Bitcoin related subreddits that aren't censored.

If you were building a commercial machine I would go with a more modern programmable reader. Also, due to the limited space on the arduino, and my even more limited coding ability, it's currently set to only accept $1 bills. I can set it for $5, $10, or $20's but it can't switch between them on the fly due to (my) coding limitations on the arduino. I'm sure someone with better coding ability could overcome this quickly. This was my first pass and it's truly for demonstration and education.

I like it! Lots of possibilities.

Any idea how much heat they throw? I have electric heat in my house and I'm thinking this may be a good idea.

Maker Faire is great! I assume Nesit will have a table again this year and depending on space we'll see if the atm makes the cut!

No, I had one handy. If I get around to a version 2 I'll likely use Pi so I can add more features. This one is very simple but good for catching people's eye and giving us a chance to educate them.

A lot of domains were taken but I just got howdoisendmoney.com. I'll set this up soon. If anyone has time and skills, or wants to learn, I can give you admin access to do it. 
edit: adding link

I bought a notebook from baronfig.com

What if I donate the max allowed and then the value increases? Are they immediately converting to USD to avoid that?
