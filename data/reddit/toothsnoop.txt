Now im back to hodl mode . Thanks lol do you recommend to keep my btc in coinbase or to transfer it to a wallet like electrum before the fork?

Thanks, back at you. Agreed 100%.I am doing this in hope to have profits going back into BTC at a dip when the correction hits. But who knows how the price per BTC will be...idk . But this is my plan

A fork is coming to branch off bitcoin to develop a new currency....holding your bitcoin in a coinbase wallet can convert it to the fork currency if it stays there so i would.....
1. Hold your bitcoin in a wallet other than coinbase so it doesnt get converted into the new currency after the fork 
2. Sell before the fork for some profit on coinbase
3. Sell for profit and invest into alts 
This is what im thinking of doing.....just cant pick yet because we dont know for sure what will happen to the price of btc.

Yeah, i thought the same thing but came across articles stating its possible. Since coinbase supports the fork, they will set the rules to your coin. Be safe and have control of your coins in a wallet or paper wallet....im using electrum .

Sounds good

I pretty much see another coin trying to branch off the main chain.......the blockchain- this is where bitcoin holds its foundation. This new fork is trying to create a new currency coin off of the mainchain...an example can be bitcoin gold (BTG).  I see it as another shitcoin.  If anyone wants to correct me or add on , please be free. Hope this helps.

Coinbase is a good start, its the most common today. Make sure you have a passcode on your phone and coinbase account , so if you do lose your phone only you will be able to access it  when you login in your coinbase email &amp; password on the new phone. Dont forget your email and password, save it somewhere. 
Side note: 
If you are into alternative coins to bitcoin, check out an exchange called bittrex . This exchange website allows you to transfer in your bitcoin from your coinbase wallet to purchase the alternative coins with btc (bitcoin) . These alts (alternative coins) can be day traded for profit or held for bigger future profits. 
HODL (hold your coins long term) .....they will be worth the hold in the next 5-10 years. 
Youtube , reddit , &amp; google are great sources to ask your questions but this website here has everything you need to know 
Sorry if i didnt answer your question or wasnt much help. I am fairly new as well . Private message me any questions you have ! Keep HODLING !!!

Use electrum if you have a android
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:47:35
Okay that makes more sense , i just moved all my btc to a android wallet that was safer than coinbase. Ill most likely keep it there until the fork clears up

Lol 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:17:40
Thats exactly how i see it ....but they are profitable
