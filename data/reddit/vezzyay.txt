They should be saying, how much do you want to spend. 
Example: I want to spend $10,000. It takes a week to transfer the money,  at the point where they have $10,000 from me they give me bitcoins based off the current rate, not off the rate when I initiated transfer. Hedging is almost always a good idea with investments for both parties, no matter what you are getting the value of you paid for, not the value a week ago.
There are risks involved with locking me in, if prices go up they lose money (I get higher bitcoin value than I paid for, for example I could turn around and sell them at current market value and profit) and if prices go down I lose money (I get lower bitcoin value than I paid for, for example I turn around and sell them at current market value and do not make profit)

Yeah I have to make a purchase and wait 1 month, I just made my first purchase with them.

Then why can I instantly make purchases with a debit card? Why can I almost instantly, within a day or two, transfer money between two bank accounts?

They are locking in the prices, that is the opposite of hedging.

Alright that makes sense, thanks.

Yes, which is NOT hedging. Which they SHOULD do since it takes a week to get your bitcoins unless you are lvl 2.
@_date: 2013-08-21 14:58:22
So they are getting the bitcoins before they have my money, even when they have to wait a week for payment?

Not at all what hedging is, in fact that is the exact opposite.

Lowers the risk for both parties involved, I posted how in another comment.

Yes, that is locking you into the purchase price, NOT hedging.
