I just invested $5,000 in a mix, $3,000 bitcoin the rest litecoin, etc.
I am assuming that bitcoin will reach $100,000 one day, and the rest have MUCH more room to grow. Just hodl. Hodl hard. 
Only problem is I trust myself less to safeguard a digital or paper wallet than I do my exchange to not get hacked or run off with money. Thankfully the exchange I'm dealing with is in my home city, I even know their addresses; so I can just go and murder the people running it if they choose to steal or get negligent with the security, and their families. Will murder them too.

Sorry to hear that. My uncle hung himself a few years ago. He left behind a wife and two children. They were financially broke, but he was too proud to ask for money from family so he would do the odd jobs. 
One day he offered to paint our house interior for $800, to help me. There I was waiting for him all day long, but he never arrived. My aunt called to see how we were doing with the painting and then I realized something was wrong. I drove from my house to theirs, and sure enough his car was parked by the side of the highway. 
I stopped, investigated and found a path into the forest nearby. There he was in a clearing, hanging from a tree branch, face blue, tongue out, eyes open. 
Of course you don't want to blame anyone in such a situation except the self-induced suicide victim, but one of his children, his son is probably the cause of it. He kept stealing what little money they had to buy drugs, gamble, etc. Got so bad, they didn't have money at times to buy their little daughter school clothes. My uncle must have snapped. 
Now that he's been gone a few years, it has become apparent that his now single wife, my aunt is also a loser. Can't even hold a job. Only the daughter is capable of work and semi-self sufficiency. The son is even worse. They both beg for money from their youngest family member, and from me on a regular basis. No shame, no motivation, no worth. 
Fuck that shit. I've cut them off for the most part but I have to stay somewhat close to make sure they don't end up proxy-killing my little cousin, like they killed my uncle. She's been depressed ever since her dad offed himself.

Oh-and there are no withdrawal fees. Except that nasty tax on profit of course. Here it is 22-45% depending on profit so I gotta set that percentage aside for the government tax thieves.

I think 10k was a psychological barrier that allowed mainstream consciousness to rise regarding bitcoin to a crucial level. It is no longer a running joke. Most people stopped joking about it at the 7k mark, this cements things. Normies are going to dig into those Satoshis and the rest of us are going to keep pumping more money in every time it drops anywhere below 10k to maintain that new barrier.
It WILL drop suddenly again, but as before, only momentarily. Maybe even for months at a time as the lions eat the gazelles.
This is a predatory market, all the gazelles (people who get scared and cash out when price tanks again) are going to get eaten. The lions (hodlers and price shorting insiders) will continue their antics as more normie gazelles show up.
Rob from the many, give to the few. It is the way of capitalism.

When BTC rises the rest rise, when it drops the rest drop. It is the 'gold' standard'. When people hear crypto they hear bitcoin shortly thereafter. If confidence in bitcoin tanked, confidence in the rest would tank.
 Make bitcoin your mainstay, but diversify a percentage of your portfolio to etherium, litecoin etc - for shits and giggles, who knows. They will all rise 3-5 fold in the coming year if bitcoin keeps rising. If I'm wrong I will drink a long black coffee without any sugar or milk.

Nope. Belorussians are free to travel abroad, invest abroad, buy and import anything from abroad. There isn't even a manned border between Russia and Belarus, and from Russia it is even more convenient to do all those things. 
So the President is president for life, who cares, he largely practices benign neglect. The country is stable, population isn't starving and people have total freedom of movement and travel.
Belarus is one of the few Former soviet republics that did not undergo severe hardship and continues to do well. Amazing what a little political stability can do. Now compare and contrast with Ukraine or Moldova-basket cases.

If it hit $1 million I would have ~$500k usd profit. Not too shabby, but not life changing either. Australia is a hyper expensive place. 500k usd will buy you an average 3-4 bedroom house in an average suburb, and living expenses are ~40k-60k per year for a small family with 1 or 2 kids.

Looking at my exchange the past hour, I'm seeing an influx of normie buy-ins. MANY small transactions (100-500) at the usd $11,500 range. 
Yes, keep them coming. *smacks lips*, *twirls moustache*

r/btc is an instrument of devious authoritarian interests. Government/Finance sector cartel run shills set up to undermine bitcoin.

Not how much you spend, it's how you spend it. 
American education focuses on stupid shit, like social science and the arts. Teach kids numbers and hard analytics. Teach kids how to compute all the things in all the ways in all situations. Fewer metaphysical masturbators more engineers.

Bitcoin ain't for games no more. It's for buying stadiums, quarries and airfields.

Is it ever going to drop below $1k again?
NOBODY KNOWS! MAYBE TEMPORARILY! 
The time to put up or shup up is always NOW. Take the plunge and hold, or forever avoid. 
I took the plunge, bought 10k at 10k/btc. 
I will hold for 100x increase or until it drops to $0. I don't care. Only bet what you can afford to lose. The odds ARE GOOD!

It's fluctuating by 500-1000 every 20-30 seconds. Same with bcash, going up/down by 10-15% in under a minute.
This is a rollercoaster now. We going up and down.

USD isn't the global standard currency reserve it used to be. There are Euros, there are Yuan...there are bitcoins.

He might suggest that it is because bitcoin for example has a limited supply-yet the demand has not even reached peak saturation. 90% of normies don't even know what a crypto currency is yet. 
Once the mine runs dry, those left holding some of the stash will be very rich indeed. (so goes the hope).

No it doesn't. Literally NONE over Android. Going from Android to iOS is like stepping back in time 5 years in terms of interface design and feature set.

If I had a time machine I could tell you. Ultimately wall st participation will drive up confidence, which will bring more normies long term. If I was a betting man I would have bought bitcoin when it was 3,000 a few months back, and not waited until it had reached 10000. i.e if you're waiting for another crash, you might miss the train to the end of the rainbow. Make of that what you will.

It would have a positive psychological impact on new buyers. The perceived barrier to entry would be lowered. Yesterday I was at the barber getting my hair cut, and I had to explain to everyone there that yes, they could buy $10 worth of bitcoin if they wanted. They ALL thought they had to purchase 1 bitcoin minimum. So I converted 6 people into bitcoin buyers. 
Yes! Change it! YES!

Yes, those are transactions. Every time you trade one thing for another, buy, sell, etc. 
I've had to deal with back taxes before and it ain't pretty. Just do your accounting properly and pay what you owe. We can't all be Apple/Facebook and bribe politicians in Ireland to give us a safe haven.

Yes, every crypto transaction is taxable; as far as I'm aware in every major country. Government wants some of that sweet crypto ass. 
Any gains you make, always factor in that 20-30% is going to end up in your corrupt oligarchs pockets eventually. 
BTC can't both be legal AND decentralized. It can have a small measure of the latter by conforming to the former. In the end governments with paid armies and police forces will put you in your place. Power controls, always. And thanks to globalization-there is nowhere to hide yourself or your ill-gotten gains. At best you can just always be on the run.

It is better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all. 
Similarly, it is better to have invested WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE and lost, than to never have invested at all.
The prevailing introspective question on anybody's death bed is always - What if? WHAT IF? What if I had bought at $1000. What if I had bought at 10,000? WHAT IF!?
Don't let this be you. If it is within your means, JUST DO IT.
