Is it more that you are worried Bitcoin would lose USD value as it would be seen less as a store of value? Or are you actually worried about improving the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin in general?
It seems to me that the harder it is to mine and the more expensive it is to send, the higher the overall value of Bitcoin in relation to FIAT currencies it can be cashed out for.

Bitcoin is about 10k overvalued right now IMO. I think its real value could be worth 10k or more in a few years, but it was in the 2k range for months this summer...and it took 8 years to reach that 2k point. 
This push to 20k was not natural, and a lot of noobs are going to get hurt. I worry that exchanges may be exposed if the price continues to fall and everyone wants to get out. That might spell disaster for crypto PR in general.

My worry is that honest questions like mine and others are being down voted like crazy. It makes me feel like there are hidden agendas, whether we want to admit them or not. 
That and you didn't even address the concerns in my comment at all. Not that it matters, my comment will be down voted and won't be answered anyways. 
These are rhetorical questions really, because we all know the truth of what is going on currently.
Get rich or die trying AMIRITE!?!

You are who you are. I don't blame you for not being given a soul at birth. You will get one eventually through reincarnation of energy that cannot be destroyed. 
Bitcoin on the other hand can be destroyed, and will be. You will take that FedCoin mark of the beast as long as it means you won't be poor and living on the streets. Next life you will gain the ability to have wisdom. Take care.

Well I mean it took 8 years to get to 2k. Of course it only makes sense that it will be 200k by end of 2018.

You're** 
Anyways, I don't think he is wrong, but maybe a bit off on where the price will settle after the crash that hasn't happened yet. 
Bitcoin and blockchain technology in general are a good thing, but only when they are fair and grass roots. Bitcoin has turned into something worse than what it was created to try and destroy. 
Average people are the ones getting fucked over here, not the big boys that have endless piles of cash lying around and can easily wait months/years during lulls in the market. 
Bitcoin was supposed to be a P2P CURRENCY, instead it has turned into an even easier way for the rich to get richer.

I can't get too in depth right now I am at work, but BTC seeing massive gains and then retracting back to it's original price, or even lower before those gains occurred is not uncommon in the slightest...and on top of that seeing that price stay low for months is not uncommon either. 
The HODL crowd isn't necessarily wrong given the history of BTC, as its long term trend over the last 5 years is upward. That doesn't mean it can't or won't drop back down to $2-5k in early 2018 and stay there for a while before it bounces back up. 
Nobody knows the future, but the past tells me that these kinds of gains followed by losses are the norm for BTC, and are perfectly healthy.

Turned on? They had to spend millions of dollars shilling reddit and censoring the only pro trump sub on a hugely leftist site leading up to the election.

Have you ever studied bitcoins price history? There is a very logical reason why it could drop to $5k or lower before "taking off".

This isn't a great place to ask that question. The majority of people here have their whole world consumed by bitcoin and its value. 
Half the people here who have made money off of bitcoin did so purely on luck, not some philosophical quest to uproot the central bankers. I know because I am one of them. I have a vested interest in bitcoin's success, but I won't lie at the expense of others purely for greed. 
Greed has taken over, and crypto has been infiltrated. Young and ignorant people looking to get rich quick by doing no work are going to get burned the hardest. 
That which has been is that which will be. Jesus was fighting against shit like this 2000 fucking years ago, nothing ever changes.
