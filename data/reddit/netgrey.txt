What happens to bcash if bitcoin decides to raise the blocksize?  You don’t have segwit, you have asic boost, and nothing else on the roadmap.

Do you have a link to the thread?

Correct, the recovery words recover the private keys onto other devices. You will never actually see the keys. If you lose the recovery words, and the device you are hosed.

Read up on BIP39 and BIP44. Essentially there’s a standard on how recovery keys and addresses are generated. This means that in the future as long as you had your recovery words you could even import into an online wallet that supported those standards.

There also the fact that most BCH nodes are running in China, most BCH miners are in China and people are going to be sad if the Chinese government decides to manipulate this.

The secret phrase is a standard. Even if hardware wallet goes out of business there are online wallets or software you can download to restore your key.

While this is great advice, if under your own control, you have to have enough technical know how to keep your private key safe. This means from hackers, from theft, fire, flood, etc etc. if someone is asking a question like OP they are likely safer keeping it in Coinbase. 
Let’s face it if Coinbase goes down the $100 they lose isn’t going to be worth much more than that on their paper wallet stuffed in their underwear drawer.

The average person will lose their coins more easily with a paper wallet than Coinbase.

Look up over the counter exchanges (otc). There’s some that will handle that volume for you with white gloves.

It wouldn’t be one buyer, it would be thousands or more people trying to buy parts of a bitcoin as almost no one would own or sell 1btc at that price. 
Imagine if bitcoin was 100 dollars a coin. You would open a sell and 100 people buying 0.01 BTC could make up the other side of your order.

If you intend to hold keep all your coins in cold storage on the trezor. Coinbase would be the hot wallet that you use to buy goods and services with bitcoin. 
Not sure why you want to wash coins, unless they were acquired illegally.
