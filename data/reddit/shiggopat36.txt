Market dump on finex

Funny enough last time he tweeted something like that was last august, i think we all remember where the price was back then. Here's the link: 
Edit: The answers are funny.

         good idea. Bitcoins only down $800 in a year.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:39:29
Bought one cause it was just too damn well played
@_date: 2016-08-12 16:25:17
Support isn't very responsive but id rather wait then be bent over
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:07:48
No sticker wasn't broken. It was just a little bump on the back of the package i think it was due to poor packaging or handling on postal service side. After reading up on the FAQ i decided it was save to give it a try and just install it and test with a small amount. Cable was outside the box and it's all working fine now feels safe

Yes i noticed that too, its glued pretty tight. Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:15:01
Thanks will do

It's linked to a google account yes. But when i format my phone all the data is gone and looking for answers online people always talk about the backup codes from 2FA and not just signing back in?
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:28:59
Ok thank you a lot sir
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:07:17
Sorry i don't quite get what you mean. I created like 4-5 2FA accounts but i have only 1 key and one MTAN written down in my backup book (offline). Would that be enough to recover the rest? So i can just format the phone, redownload google auth. app and be good with those two?

If i get it right all the Bitcoins are basicly in the same wallet. Just the proof who owns what amount is in "our" wallets. Right? Put way simplified 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:55:21
Its very small tip i just want to try it out. ;) Changetip is really awesome!  Thanks again bro
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:45:14
I see. Had some synchronizing issues too the last time but it resolved quickly. Thanks for your opinion
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:57:55
Sucks man. Return it and buy a used one, i did it too. Or just use Electrum it worked really good for me too. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:51:15
I'm always my worst enemy so it doesn't matter but thank you for the advice. :P I don't quite get it though. Lets say my Laptop breaks somehow. I get a new one, download Electrum. Enter my 12+ Words and my coins are back there correct?
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:30:22
Out of stock already?
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:04:06
Congrats to him too bro
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:11:15
Thank you for taking so much time to answer everything. 
I guess i'm keeping the Blockchain. So i'll just stick with Electrum and get some hardware wallet soon.  
send 500 bits
I hope this works i try it first time

Fatality of Karpeles should be summoning a 50k $ bed above the head of Brewster and then smashing his face in with it until paper wallets come flying out of Brewsters asshole 
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:58:02
Maybe you should use linux instead but theres probably people on here that can give better advice. To use armory you need to download the 50GB. I did it too, its not so bad it downloads fast
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:20:32
In the long run we'll see something different i'm sure. We have hit rock bottom in August i think. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:03:04
Hahahaha it's really good!! Just observing this Bitcoin thing for some months i already can sign most of the video. Karpeles was priceless. Some weeks ago some guy said he bought at 240 or something and then it fell to 230. He was very upset and ranting about it but the answer of some redditor was simply
"Welcome to bitcoin motherfucker."
I laughed really hard, no offense to the OP though i bet he has calmed down now that it's up a little
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:45:02
Don't use Windows 10 at all. It's super spyware. I think you need to download the whole Blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:55:36
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:56:40
Thanks a lot that list should be made a sticky somewhere 
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:03:31
I see, thank you 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:52:12
That was the original plan, thank you 
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:07:48
My grandpa told me about the times they were throwing paper money into the oven to get over the winter after WW2. Or paying like 5k for bread. There is NO REAL MONEY at all. Probably Bitcoin is the closest you'll ever get to real money i think. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:42:23
Thanks for the advice. I guess it's all about the balance between ease of use and security when choosing where to store Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:45:55
Will read. Thank you
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:07:34
You're right about this. We will have bigger problems than some coin on some computer in this situation. Still i think Bitcoin is better in that scenario because you can transport it in a more "undercover" fashioned way if you have to leave the country for example. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:13:09
Well you can't burn bitcoin to stay warm so that point goes to fiat lol
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:17:52
I think what bitcoin needs is more people who aren't after short term money making but longtime growth and slow price increase. The idea of Bitcoin is not to convert to fiat because price is a little higher than before. Of course we need fiat to survive at this point but it shouldn't be the main focus to gain 10k or something of fiat. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:46:10
People agree that that paper is worth something, so of course it is worth something right now. Bitcoin is something different because it can't be printed infinately like fiat. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:40:52
Used Transfer. But i'm sure there is a possibility to buy with credit card as well. Just ask around since i'm new to this too i can't give good info on this at this point
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:48:14
Haha thanks
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:52:01
Thanks for explaining. It's much appreciated. It's really nice to see you guys help out so much
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:39:15
BTC wasn't even mentioned in the article
