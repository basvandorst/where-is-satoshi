They're not too keen on the internet. Why would they embrace the internet of money?

Litecoin has more than tripled since I bought in, so I like it plenty.

You mean Kaynesean economics: the economic theory that has proven to be an effective tool for creating sustainable economic growth for the better part of a century? 
Shit I messed that up. What I meant to say was insert circle-jerky comment here*

I see you don't actually understand Keynesian economics. You should probably do some research into that.

Have you ever heard the expression "it's better to be thought a fool and remain silent than to open your mouth and remove all doubt?" If you don't want to actually learn about a topic before taking, that's your business. If you don't want people to know you're full of shit, though, it's best not to advertise.
In response to your one point, though, no one in their right mind advocated for predatory loans aimed at people who couldn't repay them except for the select few who knew they could get rich exploiting poor people. The 2008 crashed from lack of banking regulation, not any economic philosophy.

Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for goods and services. Otherwise, it's just paper and numbers. Right now, it seems like bitcoin is a commodity item like gold that people are buying in case the value goes up. Like bitcoin, I can't buy groceries or pay my bills with gold. Unlike gold, though, I don't know of any store I can go to and exchange bitcoin for money.

How do you sell it?

Yes, I have done pretty well in stocks. For example, I bought Nintendo stock back in 2015 for like $125 a share. The reason I did that, though, is because I knew Nintendo had assets it could leverage, products it would be producing, and a long history of profitability. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, though. You buy it speculating that the price will go up and hoping it will go mainstream, but there's no reason it should. It's kind of an interesting comparison. The Wii U never caught on mainstream because it's main gimmick (a second screen) wasn't something most people cared about. I am skeptical of bitcoin because I do not see the value of its main gimmick (decentralized currency). The currency we have already works, and I'm not convinced there are many people other than libertarians who really care about how money is regulated. It looks like bitcoin does work as a speculative investment, but so did beanie babies in the 90s.

Seriously, though, what is it even for? I don't think the grocery store accepts it, and I can't pay my rent with it. How is this different from when people were buying sims money?

PayPal, checks, and EBT cards all work in under one currency. That's not the same as accepting a whole other form of currency. It would be like a grocery store accepting a bag of gold doubloons for a case of beer. The gold has value, but that'd require the store owner to take extra time to convert them into real money, which is the problematic part.

Credit cards allow consumers to spend more money than they would otherwise, which makes them good for retailers. Why would a retailer accept bitcoin, though. It's like if Walgreens started accepting Yen in America. They could, but it's easier for them to just not.

I get that people are buying it on speculation, but doesn't that just create a bubble? I mean, you say bitcoin will be worth a million dollars each, but why? It doesn't have any internal value. It only has value if you can exchange it for real money. And who will be able to afford to give you a million real dollars for a single bit coin? And why would they instead of keeping the real money they can actually use?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:16:57
But if bitcoin does inflate to a million dollars per coin, how could you possibly buy groceries with that unless you want exactly one million dollars worth of food? Can you give someone one one hundredth of a coin?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:18:00
If you have to trade it for real money for it to be useful, doesn't that show it's not very practical as a form of currency?

The author of most of those articles is a libertarian software engineer, not an actual economist. Plus, they all read like opinion pieces rather than research articles. I'm not sure about the value of that information, but I do appreciate you pointing them out to me as I had never read any of them before.

How much is that in Stanley nickles?
