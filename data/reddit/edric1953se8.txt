Thanks for the replies
I have been trying to get a traditional mortgage for quite a while with the high street banks.
To date I have not been able to jump through all the hoops. I have a 10% deposit &amp; a good credit rating.
My son who is a Bitcoin fanatic &amp; early adopter has offered to put up collateral in Btc to cover any btc loan made to me.
I have the opportunity to buy a house with vendor finance were I pay 20% the remainder being paid  over two years in four six monthly instalments.
I can cover proximately 30% of these instalments, I need a loan in btc to cover the difference.
How I see it working is, lets say the the house = $100,000  I pay $20,000 dep  to vendor
month 6	I need $20,000 for vendor, I pay $6,000 borrow Btc to the value of  $14,000
month 12	I need $20,000 for vendor,		as above
month 18	I need $20,000 for vendor,		as above
month 24	I need $20,000 for vendor,		as above
At this point I have the deeds, &amp; can raise approximately $40,000 to pay the Btc loan/s
I'm $16,000 short of paying all the Btc loan/s, so I would need a further six months to do so.
A amount of Btc would be deposited in a Btc add as escrow
Investors would be paid an agreed % monthly for any  Btc loaned.
If I do not make any payment, the escrow add will do so.
