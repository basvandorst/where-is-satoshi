It's not true though. It's 40¢ per day, then 5,82 ¢/kWh for the first 33 kWh. From there it's 8,92¢/kWh.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:55:42
Both statements are absolutely true though?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:42:57
Realistically, it doesn't. Most people don't even know how to install and use a wallet.

I meant for me in Quebec lol

It's pretty easy to split gold though.

He's saying that the muggers would wait for a confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:59:12
I guess reality itself is just subjective then?

Dividing the profits on two payments over two years might diminish the percentage of taxes you have to pay on it.

Why not pay for roads on a per-use basis? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:52:38
Just out of curiosity, can you find me a post deleted by the mods on ? I've never seen one.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:05:31
How long does it take for the transactions to confirm tho? I don't think coffee shops are ready to wait for like 15 minutes for a transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:08:24
What happened to wanting to fight large corporations, banks and giving people control over their currency? Why are you are actively discouraging people who can't afford 10$ per transaction to use bitcoin?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but having all services privatized seems good only for very rich people, not for average people. 
Private services can be more innovative and efficient than government run services, but they also charge a mark-up. Most studies I've seen say private services are [more expensive](  [or have little effect on price](

To give a gram of gold to my friend I have to spend 3 grams of gold?
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:43:41
Yup, but guess what? If I had cancer in Canada or most of Europe, I wouldn't have to pay 200,000+ for treatment. And I certainly don't pay nearly that much in taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:26:00


Ayy lmao I guess "Equality before the Law" shouldn't be a human right because you can't demand services from a lawyer without compensation?
What about the "Right to Education"? You can't demand services from a teacher without compensation!
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:00:45
That's true, but don't US citizens pay just as much in taxes, yet many have to pay out of pocket to have access to healthcare?
EDIT: most VS many
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:48:24
That's a fair comparison. However, I think calculating the benefit of public services is not so simple.
Can you really say you don't benefit at all from police presence? For example, even if you don't ever interact with a police officer, their presence lowers crime and generally makes a neighborhood nicer, raising the property value. Same goes for hospitals, schools, public transit, fire stations and public libraries. You benefit from them just by being near them. That's part of why property in rural areas is often cheaper.

Negative interest rates mean the lender has to pay interest to the borrower, friendo.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:28:10
They can kick you out of the hospital bruh.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:27:10
Ah I see.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:58:19
Yeah, that's true.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:08:13
That's fair. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:56:27
You need permission from your country to live abroad? because I'm pretty sure you don't.
Just to clarify: You don't want to pay taxes, but want to use public services and infrastructure?
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:52:31
They go to the miners as well.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:16:56
It IS voluntary since you voluntarily chose to live in the country.

It's already noon in China and even later in Japan tho.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:18:17
I didn't say that. Calling them hoes is misogyny.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:53:50
Yeah, I was wrong. I found this chart of the price of gold over 100 years, and it's been fluctuating a lot, even counting inflation. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:17:29
All holders of gold can find a buyer at it's current price though. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:19:05
Can I buy some misogyny with my bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:39:27
Not many people know this, but China actually banned reincarnation. 
[They're using these laws to catch the Tibetan Lamas.](
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:46:28
Sell a kidney today! You can buy a cheap Chinese one in a few years, once you're rich!
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:37:36
Could you use all the money that's in your savings account if you wanted, without electricity? I'm betting you can't.

I'm pretty jealous right now. [Here is a Italian provider that offers a 1Gbit fiber line for 20 euros per month](
