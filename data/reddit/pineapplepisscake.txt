Mining at a loss?
I've input some horrendous variables into my calculations such as the difficulty hitting 2billion, the price of bitcoin crashing and the difficulty factor being a lot higher and I still come out tops. :(

I'm asking for an easy way to buy coins - removed my wallet ID? I'm new to it and don't really understand how you are meant to buy. Not beg.

Well that makes sense then.... Just have to bring myself to bother with all the verification stuff now then.
Already missed out on the last 2 dips when I was looking at them god damn it.

Yeah I'd too like that. it is just a matter of deciding what to buy..

So after finally getting £/$ into an account with Bitstamp, I am then able to buy/sell rapidly, right?

Oh dear!
I was told to use BitQuick so I thought it was fine for me to use as someone from the EU. Why can I not pay for this order just because I am outside of the US...?
Ahh this is annoying now..

Discussion as to whether or not investing in mining is a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:53:19
And you're okay with aving to buy at a price clearly above the market..?
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:32:37
Quite dislike bitbargain.. It is over priced but thanks

A 500 GH/s miner for 10Bitcoins ~ $6,000?
I could order a 2 TH/s for around $12,000, how does that math even work out in favuor of that company?

Ok that makes some sense at least. But then you have to state a price that you would be happy to buy at? Let's say that I set an order to buy 1BTC if the price drops to $200, but what if it continues to drop to say $20.. I have just wasted money due to the roder being crap, no?
