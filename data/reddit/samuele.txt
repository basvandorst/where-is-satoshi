Well, if that are really your concerns then think about it this way: the internet is most probably going to get deeper into our lives, so how despite that can we reverse the bad effects it causes?
I don’t have an answer, but I had a thought, maybe there is going to be some kind of a natural correction to the hype. I think that the last decade is saturated due to all the technical advances, and maybe the hype will come back down when it gets old, and people will start to re-appreciate simple life.

Yes, you are right. But for some reason their website makes them look like a scam... not saying that they are though.

I know, im just saying it looks bad.
But also im a web developer, so maybe my standard is higher that normal...

That's why im asking.
Currently, the only company that sells Bitcoin in Israel has extremly high fees. The company is called "Bits of gold"(I don't know if it is related to the shop in the picture)
The pricing is as follows:
If you buy in cash then there are two options, ATM and a deposit (like Western union). ATM's fees are 5%, and the deposit takes 3%(or min 30ILS if you deposit below 1000ILS) and an additional 5% for "Bits of Gold".
If you want to use a credit card then its 5% for clearing and additional 3% to "Bits of gold". and it has to be between 50$ to 5000$.
And if you would like to buy more than 5000ILS worth of bitcoins then you can do a bank transfer(which will take a day) and the fees will be  3.95% from "what they receive", which means that it doesn't include the transfer fees.
Updated with exact numbers.

Where is this? And do you know what the fees might be?
