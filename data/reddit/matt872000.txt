You've got a great point. You don't need to be able to spend it for it to have value. As long as people are still willing to buy it it will hold value.

I got the exact same thing. Did someone send out a drunk email?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:39:53
Yup, exactly. The attorney general also mentioned "There will be a chance for investors to recoup their funds if we do ban exchanges."
I honestly don't know what that means. Will he force exchanges to pay for the bitcoin? Will it be a mass selling on the Korean exchanges? It seems like there is not even a real plan in place yet. It could very well be manipulation of the markets so he can invest.

If Sony started taking bitcoin I would finally start buying games again.  I have tried three different credit cards, my paypal account, and even my mother's paypal account. I tried going through customer support and they said to try again later.

They are no longer allowing foreigners, even residents to deposit money into bitcoin exchanges. Make of that what you will. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:23:12
I just read a Korean article. The attorney General said they are trying to write laws to prevent people from speculating and gambling on exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:06:38
It was a different article from an even less reputable source.
They recently passed some laws here to make it so that you can't deposit fiat funds into another person's bitcoin account. The goal was to prevent money laundering.  The president here also promised to help the nation invest in cryptocurrencies in his election platform.
It seems the government just really wants to crack down on the money laundering and try to prevent Chinese and other non-residents of Korea from funneling money here.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:57:43
But that's not as exciting or scary! /s
Just like most headlines about anything it's all being blown way out of proportion. There was an article on yesterday that said "Korea to ban bitcoin starting next week!" Turns out it was a load of horse shit based on an old article about one old man in government that doesn't like gambling.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:03:10
They repealed that law but there's still a ton of stuff that works better in IE... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:53:10
It's an older article, but it's true. The government was just talking about promoting crypto in the country last month. Right now the government isn't saying they will ban bitcoin, the attorney general made a statement that he wants to write a law next week that will try to prevent "speculation and gambling on exchanges."
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:35:27
This does seem likely. The Korean attorney general is complaining about how this is "an out of control bubble" and that Koreans are being screwed by the "kimchi premium" on Korean exchanges. So he thinks there should be more restrictions on bitcoin trading.
The dude has no idea how basic economy works...
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:12:25
There are a fair amount of people that probably just got much richer from that announcement. Swinging from 20,000,000won to 15,000,000 won and back again in a day...
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:53:16
This is old news, but the same situation.
Like I said in the other thread, someone made a ton of money of these two announcements.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:48:37
The articles I've read in Korean all say "Attorney General says he plans to start writing a bill to try and prevent speculation and gambling on cryptocurrency exchanges next week."
It's not an all out ban. That and it really seems like the "raids" or, more appropriately phrased, "tax investigations", were not actually connected to the attorney general's announcement.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:26:39
I just read a Korean article now, though. Apparently the attorney general here is going to start writing a law next week that will prevent people from "speculating and gambling" on bitcoin. We'll see how far it goes, though. It'll be a tough one to pass and it's notoriously difficult to get that stuff through the Korean law system.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:57:03
It's funny how the English articles are all talking about outright bans when the Korean articles just say that he's trying to write a law to prevent "speculation and gambling on exchanges."
Anyway, it will take them a while to write a law and we'll see if it even gets through.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:15:40
Not really. The overwhelming real talk from the government is that they want to treat it like a stock but male sure it can't be used to launder money. The worst thing they'll do is add a capital gains tax. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:02:20
It wouldn't shock me if he was trying to get his own money in, to be honest. That or some of these English news sites that are claiming "South Korea will ban bitcoin starting next week."
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:26:22
It doesn't seem that way. I just read a Korean article now, though.

I hope you're just joking. Confiscating bitcoins? What are they gonna do?

Anyway, I'm in Korea and this isn't happening.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:30:16
I found some Korean articles talking about banning bitcoin later on.  The thing is, even WITH that, they would need government support to pass laws and the finance minister came out saying that he was blindsided by the announcement and would not support it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:27:40

Really? These issues have been around for months. Lightning is coming and that will apparently fix it, but since the whole Coinbase BCH fiasco the posts about it here have just skyrocketed.

"The South Korean government also prohibited foreigners from trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the local market because of its previous crackdown on Chinese traders who brought in massive amounts of bitcoin from China to South Korea with the sole intent of arbitraging and laundering money."
As a foreigner in Korea I'm still allowed to use exchanges. The thing they are doing is not allowing non-residents (without a residence visa) to open exchange accounts.If you have a residence visa you are issued a government ID number and you need that to provide proof to the exchanges you are who you say you are.
This means it would be impossible to verify IDs of people who are not residents, not that foreigners are banned from exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:43:59
Thank you, let's downvote the FUD trolls who have nothing better do than tell everyone they are selling when they are just waiting for the price to get down so they can get discount coins, too.

I think that was more about their "KakaoPay" service, which is essentially keeping money in your Kakao account to transfer money to friends or pay for things like a prepaid credit card.
Online banking and shopping in Korea is a strange beast. 
The law requires people to use their real names and national ID numbers in order to register for anything online and banks or online marketplaces are required to have specific brands of security measures by the government. Up until recently they all required active X or the Korean equivalent for mobile on android.
However, if Kakao gets in on Bitcoin exchanges in Korea it would already face a bit of competition, but major companies like Kakao are favoured here. There is already Korbit and Coinplug. Coinplug actually offers bitcoin withdrawals from regular ATMs and with both Korbit and coinplug you can fund your exchange accounts through regular bank transfers.
The one thing I would love to see Korea get, and Kakao could bring this, is more wide acceptance of bitcoin and the ability to make everyday transactions with it. There are no bitcoin-accepting businesses where I am in Korea and I only know of a small amount in Seoul. 
Kakao has the clout to bring more people into Bitcoin and I think that would be a good thing. However, I'm worried that, in true major Korean business fashion, they will just try to make their own blockchain and digital currency.
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:18:52
Yup, there are ways to get to them, but most of those sites are blocked here in Korea as betting outside of the government regulated horse racing, lotto, and sports "pick 'em" style tickets is illegal.

Today's my payday, I should be getting paid in an hour or so. It's likely going to rise before I get paid like it always does...
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:52:33
Awesome! I can't really complain, I've already made a profit in bitcoin and still have a fair bit invested.

Yeah, come on, you have to make her think you could hit her if she steps out of line. Women like assholes and you have to make sure she fears you as much as she loves you. /s
In all seriousness: Good job to OP, he obviously knows what he's doing.

Blech, I hate how Canada is always so behind the times when it comes to tech. Apple pay also seems like to worst horse to get behind in terms of digital payments...

I'd generally avoid most casino games or card games if I were to gamble. Sports betting would make more sense to me. Clear odds, small if nonexistant house edge.

I wouldn't mind the reverse of that. I'd love to buy things from Canada or America and get them into Korea without paying ridiculous overhead...
@_date: 2016-05-27 07:07:41
I've done some arbitrage between Circle and Korbit (here in Korea) because Korbit is usually a bit more expensive than everywhere else.
The benefit I have is having both a Canadian and a Korean bank account to buy bitcoins with. It's stuff like that that makes it good for exchanges. That being said, I wish there was more arbitrage between Korbit and other exchanges to drive our price down a little bit...

It's over guys, just give me all your bitcoin and I'll dispose of it.

MOON Jae In was just elected in Korea. We have four years of Moonshot coming here. It's a sign!

I didn't realize it, but you are completely right...
At first I thought he was looking for a lawyer that knew something about bitcoin, but no, probably looking to damage someone's reputation.

Well, the books he's put them in seem a little bit targeted to someone who would at least know about bitcoin.

I want to make a shit-post like this ["For all the newbies to the sub-reddit!"](

How does this even work? They don't take custody of funds but allow transfers, doesn't bitcoin already allow moving funds anywhere else in the world?

Can someone ELI5 what will happen, if there is a chainsplit, to my bitcoin?
