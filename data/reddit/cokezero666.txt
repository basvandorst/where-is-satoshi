Isnt the mining algorithm already setup so you can still make money it just takes a while regardless of your hashing power?
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:59:50
Agreed. ASICS might be the reason bitcoin ends up being non-viable.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:02:48
This whole debacle with Jihan Wu might be coming at the right time. Maybe its time to open up the discussion on how bitcoin can be changed so its not possible or virtually impossible to centralize it as as being attempted right now.

Makeas a lot of sense what youre saying but the only thing is that the  price is low and how are we supposed to bring it up? Cant just raise the price artificially can we?
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:17:36
totally agree with you. However I thinking giving up here would be massively -EV.
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:08:11
not enough!
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:29:12
so sweep means that Im taking bitcoins from the wallet and putting them  into mine?

Sorry if my post wasnt clear enough. We used localbitcoins but we traded over the internet. After the first two trades, we just traded on skype. He sent me Neteller funds and I sent him bitcoins. 
I dont know where he lives or what he looks like.

Im not sure why im getting downvotes. I would think people would empathize a bit more :(
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:35:57
hah yea. When its all said and done, I will have to say 'wp' to the guy who did it. I got outplayed.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:36:06
Thanks for your post. I should def have taken some more steps to protect myself. Ill note some of this down e.g. calling at company number and what not. right now tho, my focus is on getting this money back.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:03:48
Thanks. Its nice to hear this once in a while amongst the 'YOU DESERVED IT ASSHOLE!' posts.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:47:02
I think falling from a high place would be a more fun way to go :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:37:23
Is this for US people only?
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:56:52
three words: cool story bro.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:52:17
more like 100+ :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:47:50
not sure if srs.
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:29:03
This is a drop in the ocean compared to news stories being published about millions being taken thru hacking. Please think about that. You could help me out a ton by upvoting and this wont attract as much negative PR for bitcoin compared to some of hte bigger stories.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:16:51
Dont get all riled up bro :) But I appreciate the support in this thread. If you were where I am, Id buy you a beer :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:25:47
hey dude. Selling bitcoins for thai baht via bank transfer. Ive done a ton of trades before via localbitcoins. Check rating etc.
OR add me on skype: ahmar78 and I can help you out.
yeh-nah-yeh can vouch for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:53:08
how many was it? Theres still a good chance it comes down to mid 300s, but I woulda probably thought about selling around this price.
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:34:20
 Your post is the one that makes the most sense. Thanks. Sometimes I need a reality check.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:03:51
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:35:09
One bank just needs to embrace bitcoin and take business away from these morons.
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:03:23
you think its fair that they just made a reversal of transactions without telling me why?
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:16:55
he sent first lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:53:43
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:52:05
They should make it the default tho, along with other exchanges. How do we get their attention to this?
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:03:08
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:01:13
Thanks. Merry Xmas.

I am in Thailand. The police wont do anything about this here. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:44:11
I agree with you. You would think a legit company like Neteller wants to do the right thing and protect its customers, but in the end, money is the objective and money makes the world go round.
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:39:41
Thanks. Appreciate the kind words.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:13:16
hehe this comment made me laugh. good one.
@_date: 2013-12-21 12:47:12
Thanks. Yea I expected people to hate a little. no biggie. Just desperate to try and fix this situation. 
Im a risk taker at heart or reckless or stupid. Take your pick. So Ill end up in these situations from time to time. Its what makes life flavourful. :)
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:03:15
doge to the moon!!
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:37:59
yea originally I thought I would get scammed outta 72k, cuz I was counting all the different transactions I had done with him. However upon reviewing my accounts after they were opened I added up everything and the total was 85k
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:02:59
Im not sure where I blamed others for my mistakes. I realize I could have handled it better but what happened here is definitely not fair. A company like Neteller has fraud protection insurance and they protect their business accounts with 100% guaranteed (check their website) fraud protection, but they cannot do that for a loyal customer who did a few big trades and got cheated for a large amount of money?

Im celebrating by ordering McDonalds. Gonna get TWO burgers this time, a pie and a sundae. Gotta live a little!
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:47:21
