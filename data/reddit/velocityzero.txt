I know what you mean and am well versed in our current system. But would you not agree that if some entity had 2/3rds of the supply of a currency and held onto it until said currency was globally established and "value" had stabilized they could control and manipulate it for some time? As well as making them 2x as "wealthy" as the entire global value of the currency system?

I remember reading that after the huge bubble, when it peaked at like 5k/bitcoin, that ~60-70% of the coins stopped being transacted.  I just assumed that banks, the natural competitors to this, bought them all when they are cheap(now) and holding them for when it becomes a legit currency and then they control the supply of money again anyway.

But if the means of all production were already functioning and running on 1/3 of a currency, couldn't they manipulate it at a very slow rate like the U.S. Federal Reserve for a very very very long time?  Wouldn't it be practically the same as creating currency?  I know it already exists, but if is not "in the system" until the point in time when 1/3 of the currency is fully established as 100% of production wouldn't that give them "X" years of manipulation at a low rate isn't it similar?  I know it has a practical "end" to when they would have to stop, but... you get what I'm saying?  
Also, tell me I'm wrong, in any way you can.  I truly only see a marginal difference in these two models.  I would love to feel more comfort, but my mind just goes back to "same old shit."
