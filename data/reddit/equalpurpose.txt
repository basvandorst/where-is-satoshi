Yeah, this artice leaves you just as clueless as before you clicked it.

"bitcoin is done."
Don't you just fucking love to hear something like that.

Did you look at the cartoon?
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:27:42
Sounds like a good gamble!

Not typical segwit TXs, right? I thought they were something like 400-500 WU, but I'm probably wrong.

Coming very soon

Nah, more fair to forget about them and make it a donation to all!

China banning mining wouldn't change anything except making blocks coming slighly slower for a few weeks.
@_date: 2019-10-02 14:10:57
You don't understand mining, or bitcoin if you think holding miners give you that kind of control. Those miners would be out of business the same second that happend.

Can confirm! These are the words in my screen.

Zero in this context means worthless. Does it really matter if an investment lost 99% or 100%? Usually not
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:20:26
Explain the process of the chinese government taking over BTC. 
Hint: having any amount of hashpower doesn't give you that power.
@_date: 2019-12-20 13:46:39
Sounds like a really really stupid idea, so I wouldn't be suprised if they go ahead with it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 21:10:02
Or write it down to take home
@_date: 2019-04-18 05:05:55
Thanks for making our bitcoins more valueble!
Nah just kidding that’s not how economics work :)

eligus was (is?) luke-jr's mining pool and he's a devout christian so that's the explaination for that if anyone cares.
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:35:06
Keep working. You'll get there
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:27:20
Doens't affect bitcoin one bit. If they lost anything it wasn't bitcoin.

Nope, they sell for EUR at moment of sale.

Highly exaggerated fee you claim, but still, hopefully LN

No kraken is not us only. Bitstamp is great aswell
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:08:34
80m dollars? yeah, that would be quite a pizzeria :)

Lazlo is a fucking legend and he’ll be forever celebrated in history no doubt
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:17:08
At an exchange, but it was traded before that. It obv wasnt worth 0.06$ when he traded 10k btc for a pizza
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:31:10
he's been a bagholder in that moronic project for years.
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:47:17
Proper fucking legend right there!
