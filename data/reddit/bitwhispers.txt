Totally earth shattering!

Ulbricht’s lead attorney, Joshua Dratel, said that Karpeles was the man pulling the strings behind Silk Road from 2011 until 2013, and that his associate Ashley Barr, a Canadian computer scientist, became the famously libertarian voice of Dread Pirate Roberts.
“Lots of little things added up to [Karpeles],” Der-Yeghiayan testified.
In a meeting with other Homeland Security agents, Der-Yeghiayan recalled saying that “we have built up quite a large amount of information that leads to this.”
Der-Yeghiayan, however, was convinced that the investigation still had further to go before making an arrest and taking Karpeles to court. He advised other law enforcement agents against speaking to Karpeles about Silk Road, so as to not tip him off.
At the time, there were investigations into several potential crimes that Karpeles had committed.
Instead, other Homeland Security investigations into Karpeles, for separate and related crimes, led investigators to seize $2 million from Karpeles in May 2013, thus tipping Karpeles off that he was on the radar of the United States government.
Although he was “upset” about the premature law enforcement contact, Der-Yeghiayan said he continued his investigation into Karpeles.
“You believed him to be the mastermind behind Silk Road, keeping it secure and operating?” Ulbricht defense attorney Dratel asked Der-Yeghiayan.
“I did,” Der-Yeghiayan testified.
As the argument was unveiled, Ulbricht let out a rare beaming smile and turned to his parents. They nodded at one another, marking the most electric moment in the trial so far.
Der-Yeghiayan testified that his own investigation had found that Mutum Sigilum, a Karpeles holding company, had registered silkroadmarket.org as a means to publicize the site further.
The Homeland Security agent’s theory was that Karpeles, as owner of Mt. Gox, held an enormous amount of Bitcoin. He used Silk Road to leverage that price and raise it, which it did by several hundred times over during the course of Silk Road’s lifespan. Bitcoin was worth around $2 at Silk Road's launch and hit as high as $290 by 2013.
In the summer of 2013, a separate Baltimore-based Homeland Security investigation into Karpeles went to meet with the Karpeles's lawyers, explicitly against Der-Yeghiayan’s wishes. At this meeting, Karpeles’s lawyers brought up Silk Road and said that Karpeles was willing to give up the person he thought to be running Silk Road in order to gain immunity from other charges pending against him.
Der-Yeghiayan said he was “upset” about the contact and says he wrote a lengthy memo about the problems in the investigation.
Dratel says that it was only after this happened that Ulbricht was lured back into Silk Road, an entity he allegedly left behind two years prior, in order to be the “fall guy” who would ultimately take the charges that could leave him in prison for life.

Wow, shadow banned ? wtf ? not really off topic as all this has to do with people putting BTC into this scam. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:13:33
So true. You bring up an interesting time line of characters and phases . I wonder who the next group is ? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:47:32
either way. There is a marketplace for stolen coins.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:12:40
No. We don't know if they are all stolen coins on other coins. I mean, this would def.  *be* stolen coins. It would attract all those who have stolen/hacked BTC to sell at.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:18:17
awesome! Let us know what you find out if anything.
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:41:27
Someone has evidence of Mark k. making death threats to an ex-
Gox employee. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:07:40


Wow, now that is flash back from the past! Good catch Ver. I wonder if all these people are just one big cabal of corruption even include Bruce "Tom" Wagner from MyBitcoin.com for all we know. At this point anything is possible!
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:25:17
Can you say deep do-do.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:37:18
I hear where you are coming from. The only problem is Mr. Karpeles isn't denying he doesn't know anything about SilkRoad. He clearly has his little frappicino paws in this somehow. It isn't like he is like all of us watching from a 10,000 ft. view.
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:43:54
Trezor seems like a good system.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:44:06
No doubt about it. How did he go under the radar so long I wonder ? Someone needs to find out if this guy is sipping Mai Tai in the Bahamas right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:35:15
Seems to be the correct Ashley Barr. Anyone getting in touch with Mr. Barr?
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:35:09
haha good one! 
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:58:09

I'm ready to be mind blown!
LSD in fraps highly likely.
@_date: 2015-01-17 05:57:03
I edited it above for one reason why it would be different, also the thief probably would get some lulz for it knowing there is an exchange for him/her so there is a physcological  angle. Plus, others I can't think of right now.
You are right about any exchange let's you set the price well let's see what these thieves set it at.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:40:33
I guess gives a whole new meaning to  ?
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:51:12
This ^^ . People want the transactions reversed as their balances are showing up negative .
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:16:15
Lol thieves stealing others thieves loot ?
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:02:02
Haha no I did pull that from his twitter feed ;-)
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:30:30
Some HashTalk comments are priceless:

THIS JUST SCREAMS CENTRALIZATION!
Yeah, I have to say, not cool. How can it be a bad market when we're all here buying like crazy?
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:26:20
Great time to show how the free market works when the manipulator is away.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:50:47
This is actually a good point. Someone needs to trace those amount of coins and see if they end up from Mt Gox -&gt; Silk Road. Then can put a plausible case that these are rightfully mt.gox customers coins. Interesting twist.
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:03:05
Should be ways . Documents showing they are rightful owners to x amount of BTC and entitled to fee's up to the amount stolen then it just auto shuts off.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:38:47
In general it would be nice to get Mark up on the stand if anything. I'm sure he'll fumble around and expose himself by accident.  By the way, is Mark a hero if he really is the person who ran SR and is DPR ? lol ironic twist.
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:26:57
He ate the announcement.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:29:29
**What a strange trip its beeeeeennn...**
@_date: 2015-09-06 23:43:27
to much hey ?
@_date: 2015-09-06 21:12:43
Is that for real ?
@_date: 2015-09-06 03:26:53
Sorry to hear that :/
Yes, seems its only mainstream banks in a way.
@_date: 2015-09-06 20:01:57
I couldn't agree more with this. Its as easy as making an app that make sense to the everyday user. We really don't have that yet.
@_date: 2015-09-06 03:14:17
I've always liked lawnmower.io.
@_date: 2015-09-06 05:03:35
Hoobastank is awesome! Be cool to see that for sure. I sent you a message on twitter.
@_date: 2015-09-06 02:29:42
She did bring a lot of attention to Bitcoin but I get what you are saying.  I think more artists will accept Bitcoin at some point. Micro-payments are probably the killer app.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:33:54
Does it feel like woman are being invited and included to you ?
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:02:18
Hey! awesome forum!  I'll post them there for sure. In fact, if you have an RSS feed maybe we can do some sort of feed right into the forum. I'm going to go sign-up to it now!
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:35:45


This might not be far fetched and is sad :/  I believe there are more woman then men in the world ?
@_date: 2015-02-15 03:03:41


This is actually a good suggestion. As its a practical way to introduce it to them. I think adoption will come about through some unique system we haven't discovered yet.
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:01:24
Thanks coinlock!   I have a few more queue'd up to post shortly!
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:29:48
Cool :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:32:37
I guess that is the question then. Why aren't more woman taking advantage of this global open source project ?
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:23:32
Good suggestion Gonzobon. I agree.  Darknet vendors &amp; Darknet operators are a fascinating bunch to interview. Anything you want me in particular to ask them ? I think I'll do  3 part series for this.
CEO outreach is a good idea. Always interesting to hear their take on things.  
KYC laws do seem be an interesting topic. Great suggestions all added to my list! ;-)

This is in relationship to a dust up between Gavin Andresen and Cody Wilson. Cody Wilson said he got approval from Gavin to disband the Bitcoin Foundation.
