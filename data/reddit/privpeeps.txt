Sorry to hear that, it appears we are two of many.  If it is any respite for you - the ultramixer domain has now been suspended and taken down - my local authorites have been very helpful, as has the registrar, hosting platform and mail service provider. I don't expect anything further to come of it, but would hate for anyone else to be caught out as well.

Yeah, a loss is a loss, for sure -  but thankfully i had the sense to 'test the water'  with a small amount, as i always do.  Thanks for the info.

I looked at this a while back, but to be honest with you i didn't really know where to start with it, if that makes sense - i couldn't find a half decent client at the time and as such it struggled to pull me in. I'll take another look, thanks.

Yeah understandable, i try to mitigate by mixing small amounts frequently. I use two other mixing services regularly with no problems at all it has to be said (i won't reference them here , for fear of being biased).
Foolishly, i saw Ultramixer.org mentioned in an article i was reading, and as you do, I clicked through and it looks like i have been sucker punched :)
Thought i'd put it out there; see if anyone else has had experience with them and to ward off further loss.
