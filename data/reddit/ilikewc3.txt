I don't think anyone will be using BTC as a currency with these transaction times...

and waiting 2 hours for it to clear.

As a former miner, they definitely stop when it stops being profitable. If it costs more than 1 BTC to get one BTC then I'm better off just buying a BTC.

My mom is all excited about BTC.
She was all excited about houses in late 2007.
She was all excited about the internet in late 1999.
I don't think BTC is gonna crash and stay crashed... but I don't think we're early anymore.

I'd wait for a dump and jump in by mid November. October should be a good month. Might be a dump this weekend.

That's unbelievably cheap.

Honestly no one here knows what they're talking about anyways. Good luck!

Disclamer: I have no idea what I'm talking about**
In my opinion it looks like the bulls are back for a while. If it were not for these two facts I'd recommend jumping in literally right now.
1) We've had a bit of a dump every weekend. Nothing crazy. I wouldn't be surprised if we dropped to 3850ish over the weekend.
2) this one kinda worries me, but China is supposed to be banning crypto to fiat exchanges at the end of the month. This news should be pretty much priced in, however, China is crafty and I wouldn't be surprised if they threw some FUD to tank the price, then closed down all but 1 exchange, bought a bunch of crypto, and legalized crypto to fiat through that agency.  This could probably cause a pretty steep flash crash or something.
With all that said, I've got about half my portfolio in fiat (sold at 4250) and the other half in BTC/ETH. I'd love the chance to buy back in at 4000, but if we don't get there I'll be buying in at the first noticable dip. (Down 5-10% from any point)
I'd really try to find someone better at this than me though. When in doubt HODL to the moon.

There shouldn't be.

Yeah, centralization is better in every way, except it's centralized.

no.

He literally just explained why he can't do that.
