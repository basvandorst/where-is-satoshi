I agree. Trump supporters in general are VERY skeptical of fiat currency and neoliberal economics. Yuuuge untapped market (maybe not so untapped on a per capita basis)

Very true, but there is a huge movement of young people too :)

Because higher education is heavily heavily heavily left wing, and tech people are mostly subjected to higher education. Plus, much research comes out of universities. They've been heavily targeted as an area of control and it worked well. 
Very sad

Fees are pretty minimal, plus you can minimize them further by not transferring every month 
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:33:56
Well, we yanks do use metric sometimes, like for example when we're landing on the moon.

If bitcoin doesn't pull its shit together, it will be dead this time. 150k backlog transactions really? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:04:31
Right 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:27:10
Ok so the Democratic aspect of bitcoin is that it takes half of mining power to modify it, right? 
Sounds democratic. But mining power can be purchased. 
And 1% of the world's wealthiest own 30% of the world's wealth, enough to buy 50% of processing power probably a hundred million times over. 
Which is what they've done with the current finance system, they've purchased control of it. 
So what makes us think they won't buy bitcoin when it's time?

... Your bank is shit, all my banks do domestic for free
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:45:52
You're right they will tank Trump's economy. You're foolish if you think Trump has any control over that. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:15:14

@_date: 2017-05-29 01:57:55
Actually its value would become infinite...  
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:08:55
They basically won't be fixed and you've explained exactly why bitcoin will die without bigger blocks 
@_date: 2017-05-21 02:12:39
Why the fuck is it called dollar cost average. Why not just... Cost Average. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:45:39
What did we see 
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:15:20
My point is that they currently have the monetary power. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:15:38

@_date: 2017-05-06 20:17:11
Seriously. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:10:30
The fact that you felt the need to browse my history suggests that you're so emasculated by me that you had to scrounge for any hope of regaining your dignity my trying to insult me :) 
I'm just a dude, brah.

Banks give loans to governments to fight wars against each other. The same banks funded the nazis, the soviets, and the allies. They also funded both sides of the 30 years war, the napoleanic wars and many others.
