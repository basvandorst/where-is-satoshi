wouldn't the people holding the currency that was now worth more generate economic growth with their new purchasing power?
Also, wouldn't any amount of surplus that a government contain be worth more in the future, leading to lower taxes, thus stimulating the economy even more?

I am kind of confused by deflation.  I just finished watching "Money Masters" and deflation seems to be defined on it as there being less money going around. 
Bitcoin deflation seems to be an increase in demand for a scarce resource whereas the deflation of the early 1900's seems to be an reduction in the supply of a scarce resource.
In the past bitcoin deflation has led me to spending sprees that I normally wouldn't have gone on, whereas in the early 1900's it seems deflation had the opposite effect.
Bitcoin deflation seems like a great thing, but is that just because you can't really borrow them, whereas in the 1900's there were inflationary periods to trap people in debt and then the banks tightened the money supply.
I'm just thinking out loud, trying to piece it all together.

So then we would have inflation so you are saying that a deflationary system is not possible for technical reasons as well as political?

isn't currency controlled by the fed?  Isn't the fed privately owned?

That is exactly what I meant.

Nobody wants their money to be worth more in the future, that's just crazy.
Rewarded for saving?  No that's not what people want.  People want any money they haven't spent immediately to be worth less in the future.

"In Homeric times, just before the widespread introduction of coinage, the relation between gold bullion and cattle was 1 cow or ox equaled 130 grains weight in gold"
The Lost Science of Money, pg 20
130 grains of gold is about a quarter ounce, $350 CAD right now.  [And here are some calves for sale for $350 CAD] (
That, to me anyway, seems pretty stable.
I was under the impression that the instability before 1933 was caused by the fractional reserve aspect moreso than the gold.  But I'm only on page 20, so I've got a lot to learn.
edit:  I don't know how I could have missed the words "short term" which kind of made my post pointless.

hard list to make, what are flaws to one person could be seen as features to another.

countries tend to get invaded when they sell oil for a currency other than USD.
