QR codes are restricted by the number of rows and columns. The smallest matrix is 21x21 rows I believe. That could hold a bitcoin address. The physical size is only really restricted on what your reader can read. Strap a non distorting, magnifying lens on your phone and burn that puppy on a 32nm chip if you want! That goes for enlarged too! A corn field took their duster up after carving out a QR code and were able to scan the code with their phones! Maximum QR code data size is about 4kb. All 2-D and 3-D auto ID technologies that are scanned need to have good contrast opposed to their background color. The contrast can actually be graded with an ANSI test! 
Fun semi-related fact: stuff that doesn't scan at a store and is typed in manually is usually charged back to the manufacture of the product. Even if the customer still buys it.

I do not have a Bitcoin file in my application support folder. This is why I am having some trouble here. Even after I run the app I have not seen the file created. Although Sync will begin.

I found the place I needed to drag and drop. Thanks for the help. 
The problem I had was that my library folder was hidden under my user. I should have thought of that. 
Those searching in the future: When in your user folder click the gear and show options. There is an option to show library.

I've always seen "instant transactions" touted as a positive. Is this talking about confirmations because I've not seen an instant one in quite some time. Say you buy a couch at IKEA with BTC, am I supposed to wait until confirmed? what is the protocol for a cashier who accepts the payment? are they looking at your phone or whatever to see the transaction and confirm wallet address?
