Book yourself an hour with a local solicitor. £350-600 very well spent. I live in the UK and will be going through a process similar over the course of the year.
You can legitimately protect a good portion of your earnings, personally I'd ignore the moral implications of paying a lower tax rate if it is 100% legal. Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:43:17
Bless :/
I imagine you sold those when it dipped to 2k..
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:26:41
Are you the one guy who bought in at over 20k? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:11:30
I absolutely love reddit.
So many excuses today for why this won't keep rising.
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

The article that specifies $300,000 is from a Ronnie Moas, it is easier if you google him and read the articles.
But there are several that place the price in the 500k USD bracket too, and the thinking behind it is fundamentally sound.
I say this will all due respect, please don't offer me advice on getting into property or metal trading.
How about in 1 year, we both revisit this post, and if the price of bitcoin is higher than 10k then I guess I've done the right thing, and if its less, then I've done the wrong thing.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:36:24
How can you arbitrage over a month?
Isn't arbitrage the taking instant advantage of the price differences in different exchanges?
Either way you're talking as if you're brand new to crypto.
IT DOESNT WORK LIKE THAT MATE.
End of what day exactly? When does the "day" "end" according to your sage advice?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:12:17
What will people say when it is, say 15k again?
What will the excuse be? Will you guys claim its dead still?

The WHOLE thing was a bear trap, nothing more.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:08:42
Yeah, plenty of uninformed idiots.
Thankfully they invest and then sell at a loss, it helps speed up the rise of btc.

Bitcoin hitting the shitter is as likely as the internet not existing.

Only if you've literally done NO research, bought into it thinking it'll go up on a weekly basis, and have no real understanding of where blockchains are taking the world.
I couldn't give a flying shit how low it goes, just more chance to buy.

Can I ask how long it took for the ancient art of hand written letters died out after emails came along?
Did it take emails 100 years to establish a new method of communication?
What about text messages? 100 years before that was adopted?
Emojis? 100 years before we adopted them?
Touch screen phones? That also took 100 years before people used them...
You are thankfully, too slow, too naive, too well, sheep like to really see what happens on this wonderful planet, and you'll be left chasing shadows mate.
Ironic given that you're alive and here when you've got the single greatest opportunity you'll ever have.
Makes me chuckle that in 2030 you'll be furious that you didn't see it coming.

Bitcoin is never "stored locally"
Your PRIVATE keys are stored locally, which allow you to access a specific part of the blockchain that has those funds, or bitcoins attached to it.
Bitcoins ALWAYS exist on the BLOCKCHAIN only, that is the only place that can ever "be"
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:39:53
Based on what exactly? Some idiotic youtube video you saw but have zero understanding about?

The long time holders?
Not on reddit anymore because they are fucking rich.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:01:50
bit lower than I thought but BOING!!
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:35:53
it usually takes quite a few attempts to break through bigger walls like 9k, it'll be in approx 4 hours if the pattern continues.
We are consolidating at 8.6, and have been since just after 12.00am UK time. its now 2am.. In about 4 hours, it'll either break down, or up.
I personally think it will break the 8.9k resistance and climb above 9 and towards 10k
I've literally watched the charts ALL DAY :/
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:39:23
Yeah, and I'm writing this reply from Mars. 
What a paper towel.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:47:20
Please wait till it is over $20k for confirmation that we've recovered, in fact, wait till it is $25k just to be safe.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:04:08
Yeah, in DECEMBER, when it is about 100k it'll crash down again to about 35-45k in Jan.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:20:23
Oversold to the point where I think they need to come up with a new term for just how oversold this actually was.
Even 6 months ago, it COST $6k average to mine 1 btc, so that amount has probably increased to nearer $7k and they want to make a profit, and people honestly thought it was going to $0 because of the lack of "intrinsic" value.
It is madness how shortsighted people are, and even more so when money is involved.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:08:00
People who haven't got bitcoin love to think they are right about its demise.
It would be very annoying to see the opportunity of a lifetime slip between your fingers, and this is an outlet..
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:36:35
When did I say that? Go for it, day trade, I don't care either way, the price goes up over the course of a year regardless.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:05:41
NOT TOO LATE.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:14:02
Fiat being tied to gold reserves ended decades ago.
It is linked to nothing now, absolutely no tie at all, with the the QA the banks do, it should be worth zero.

Major support at 8.6k 
Bounced off that line 3 times today over the course of 9 hours.
If we cross over 8.9k it'll signify a break out to 10k +

Do you know how many people bought tulips during that craze?
About 2500 people.

I am 100% confident if you don't sell, and maybe invest a little into some  growing alt coin projects, you'd have more than 1 million from that initial investment, by the year 2020.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:41:15
In the grand scheme of things, anyone selling under about $300,000 USD is a bloody clown in my most sincere and honest and heartfelt opinion. That is my BOTTOM price. I'd probably sell about 25% at that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:21:50
It's all just a case of history repeating...

@_date: 2018-02-03 17:25:58
When it come to bitcoin, and probably crypto in general; just put in x amount and forget about it for at least a year.
Forget about it, doesn't mean you catch watch the charts daily to see what it's worth, I just mean forget about withdrawing it for a year, there hasn't been a year yet since bitcoin was created where this strategy doesn't yield HUGE gains.
Day trading is impossible at best, and stupid at worst, and stop losses for something this hyper in/deflationary? CRAZY.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:06:08

@_date: 2018-02-04 03:55:38

Of course it will rise, bitcoin will be worth 1m eventually, bloody slow if people don't see that from a fucking mile off.

Why not use DOUSING STICKS?!?

For about 5 weeks people have said we will fall to 8k
We're at 8k and everyone is acting like this wasn't predicted.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:23:03
IF it drops to 7k I predict it wont hang around long at that price and will rebound back up over 8k again almost instantly.
You never know what will happen.

@_date: 2018-02-03 11:32:54
Yup, an BOUNCED HARD off that too.. Did you see the reaction when it went that low?
I assume not, and that you just copy and paste opinions from reddit?
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:47:33
Not really, otherwise all numbers would be meaningless, and people would charge and pay wildly different amounts for every item on the planet without anyone causing a fuss.
Support levels very much exist.
If you've got no bitcoins, then this is the time to buy some.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:57:34
okay.. but 6000-8000 is still not 10%
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:16:53
Understandably so, not many people on reddit are that bright.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:16:09
Which makes me laugh when people claim bitcoin has no intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:33:32
You're absolutely missing the point of decentralised currency.
Just google Blockchain and read from there.
What you're talking about only relates to fiat currencies, this is a new way of storing assets, the assets themselves are even in a class of their own.
There are already coins that link themselves to read world things; precious metals, energy resources, the US dollar etc..
There is no way to "invest" bitcoin by holding it in a wallet.
Google "staking" and "Masternodes" 
You lock your coins to help secure the network and as a reward you get paid a percentage of your coins. - Interest basically.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:57:46

I still see comparing the ATH from a month ago to today as "day trading"
If you compare the ATH from a year ago, you sure as hell would not be selling.. it is all about the time frame you are wishing to analyse.
Long term, there isn't a period where BTC hasn't increased. We are in the embryonic stage of crypto.
I'll enjoy "playing" at being an investor, and you can enjoy being a real one. :-D
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:40:49

If you're saying bitcoin has no intrinsic value?
Have you have ever used a dollar bill in the last 30 years? Or put a purchase on a credit card? 
If you've been alive during the last 50 years, your entire life has been populated by items that have no intrinsic value.
Intrinsic value is what poor people talk about when they have nothing after selling their bitcoins for sub 50k.

@_date: 2018-02-03 17:43:20
We honestly must be looking at different charts.
Just shows how you can read the same data in 100% opposing ways.
I saw huge buys when it dropped down to the 7s, several single purchases of 100 btc.
But you see it the other way, it's what makes things so cool.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:04:42

@_date: 2018-02-02 14:39:01
Literally opposite.
Largest volume in the last week if you are going by 1 hour volumes.
It spikes when the prices rises, and dies when the price crashes, which is a sure sign of a bull market.
Just wait.
