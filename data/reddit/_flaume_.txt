AOL was just a centralized copy of the internet with a few more features and better accessibility at that time.

People can fork Bitcoin as much as they want. But they can't stop the existence of the original Bitcoin. Why would anyone put their money in an inflationary Bitcoin fork, when they could put it in the deflationary original?

Nobody is lying about future bitcoin prices.
There is no real or ultimate price tag to things like a bitcoin, a piece of gold or a glass of water.
If someone is willing to give you a million for it, then it's worth a million. If nobody is offering more than a penny, then it's worth a penny.

I don't know, man. When I first heard of Bitcoin, I was surprised that it was actually worth 8 Dollars. Some said it's a bubble, others were dreaming of 1000 Dollar Bitcoins... I've seen crazier things than a 100x increase.

The characteristics of steel and aluminum are by far more desired than those of gold. Nobody would build gold cars or ships, even if it was cheap.
Steel is less expensive than gold because about 2 billion tons are being produced every year, but only 3000 tons of gold.

If you don't know what you're doing, don't trade. Just hold and watch the rollercoaster. Daytrading BTC is basically gambling and if you're not a whale you're very likely feeding one.
