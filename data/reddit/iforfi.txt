As I previously mentioned, I am only interested in pretty popular hostings that is ran by a trustworthy company. :)  
  
The site itself doesn't look any decent.

Hmm, the domain I have there seems fine and yeah about spammy emails true, but I just unsubscribed and it's good now.

Not interested in such hosting provider company.  
Also their prices are even worse compared to namecheap.com.

Hey, thanks for those links.  
May I ask what do you mean by "Nasty spammers they are" regarding namecheap.com?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:16:04
Hey. Thanks for the answer, but I need some very reliable hosting that has been running for a decent amount of time and is pretty popular.  
  
On the site you mentioned "lowendbox.com" I can't seem to find any hosting that I would want.  
Namecheap.com so far is the best pick for me, but the VPS prices seem to be a bit too high.

Would never get that type of car tho.

If talking about BTC then I have most on something completely different, def. not windows. But there are A LOT of people that use for example an windows os wallet, yet we're talking about windows 10 such bad policy...

Just kinda sarcastic mate.  
It's pretty obvious that nowadays not many companies will accept such big payments in bitcoin, but that's nowadays I hope. :)

To be honest it's a fine warning... Many scam coins getting in and people trusting them. I don't understand the hate towards that exact post, if it was warning about bitcoin itself then yeah...

Big disgrace from them, they should be ashamed.

The problem is that scaling isn't the real issue...
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:17:06
Did you seriously change the BTC address on that screenshot? Like come on...
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:55:57
imo, $1000 is a gap where I'd consider something is really wrong...
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:31:32
And wasn't I right? ;D
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:48:31
You're fine. Just wait one month until everything settles and remember this, bitcoin drama = price fall.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:23:06
Sad because I thought he'll make an epic recover to make everything reliable.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:53:14
Never used the site, but might use it just because of them accepting Bitcoin. :)
