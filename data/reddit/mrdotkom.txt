Personally I don't see the point. You're going to use it a handful of times to buy your research chems but can't do the basic reading the FAQ or searching before posting.
Help yourself before asking others to help you

The address doesn't matter there can be a million different addresses for one wallet. You may be able to export your private key and import it into another wallet thus bringing the funds with you.
However you should not re-use a recieving address
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:06:28
If they did that then fuck em. Sure at my company we bend over backwards for our top 10 customers but there is still protocol to follow because we have shareholders to protect from disasters such as this. Any decent business should have put their foot down and emphasized that they were hired to provide security not ease of use

Because they passed a law regulating it and the license costs $$$

@_date: 2016-04-02 00:47:00
Bitcoin has absolutely nothing to do with avoiding regulations. The regulations are built into bitcoin unlike other currencies which need outside regulation which is what you're experiencing.
Do you think coinbase cares about who you are? No. They would love to be handed piles of cash and provide you with bitcoin but the laws governing where they operate state they need to have this information
@_date: 2016-04-02 15:21:09
Sounds like they use a central wallet so your funds go into their big pool and then they pay out from that.

What makes you think it's the nodes that are slow. Your node still needs to download and index the blocks which takes CPU

- Zero technical specs. Literally doesn't even say if the ethernet port is gigE or 10/100
- One blog post, from today
- Only accepts btc (i.e. you can't cancel/have no recourse when you get nothing after months)
- Not releasing for 2 more months at least
- More powerful and efficient than anything else on the market

Meh what a shitty concept
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:05:08
Why? As far as I can see it has nothing to do with bitcoin. In fact if bitcoin had been used the funds could potentially be tracked back to the pockets of the perpetrators
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:51:16
thats a perception problem not a bitcoin problem. bitcoin is not inherently vulnerable
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:38:19

@_date: 2018-01-16 01:19:29

Yep, take what you read on reddit with a grain of salt.
That being said, I trade on CEX but haven't withdrawn. I see plenty of posts on their subreddit indicating that deposits and withdrawals are taking a long time but most if not all the posts seem to indicate that after some delay the payments do go through

Since each transaction has a record on the blockchain you can follow coins as they move

@_date: 2018-01-14 15:33:46
they have no reason to. Moving coins off the exchange is what they want to prevent. Costs them nothing to recieve and high fees make people less likely to transfer to a new wallet

It's a scam. Don't enter your credentials when linked from email
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:07:27
Pretty sure Windows' core client doesn't run in daemon mode.
Daemons are just processes that run in the background. Open process list of whatever it's called and look for bitcoind. If it's running you're good, just open the ports and check to make sure other nodes can reach you
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:38:19
When is this from? Bcash isn't that high anymore, if it's from the bcash spike last month I can see why they'd run with this considering the price skyrocketed

@_date: 2018-01-28 20:38:10
That's totally dependant on the way your network is setup. You need to forward at least port 8883 and some people may have placed their miners in a DMZ in order to simplify the setup

@_date: 2018-01-05 22:56:12
lol not 66. 66 thousand btc at the supposed address which correlates with the wallet. If you google the address the address it also supposedly belongs to the GOX cold storage wallet.
So there's approximately a 0.000001% chance that wallet.dat file contains anything and no remote chance it belongs to that address, if it did someone would invest the money to crack the passphrase rather than give away a billion dollars
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:41:20
That's an exchange problem

Call the police. Print all communication with the user (so that even if they delete it you have a record).

The numbers will depend on your peer count (which is a configurable setting but also defined by the hardware). This is about the traffic both in and outbound for my network from the node for Aug-Sept

wow paging @_date: 2017-12-06 07:44:53
You bought in $500 at 12k meaning you bought 1/24th of a bitcoin (ignoring fees) meaning you own 0.041666666666667 btc.
When the price goes to 13k you mutliply your 0.041666666666667 btc by the new price $13k and subtract the original $500 you put in and you've got your increase.
Seriously this is middleschool math at best... The school systems have failed us once again dumb dumb
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:30:22
Because how else can you use the bitcoin network without internet? Even on mobile 4G can hit 6.5Mb/sec easily
Besides not every user needs to run a node. Nodes decentralize the relay of transactions, they're not required for every user. Sure the more there are the better but I can't find VPS hosting that provides less than 100Mb/s connections and those are often $2-5/mo

You don't need to re-download after the original synch but you will be serving up the blockchain to other peers who need to download it and as transactions get added you'll be downloading those.
So it's not just a one and done type situation but the original sync is the one that'll take the longest

You have a paper wallet. The two QR codes are the public and private keys. The private key can be scanned by a real wallet (ie not coinbase) and the funds will be swept from the paper wallet to the app where you scanned it. You can then send that amount to coinbase to sell for fiat
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:25:33
No personal benefit of running a standard node but it's helping to distribute the blockchain, less nodes means less copies of the ledger.
Of course you can also use nodes for paying and accepting payment so not like it's useless

The order of what happened.
You initiated payment of $90 (EUR) to a seller.
Paypal checks your balance and withdraws from your bank
Paypal sends $90 (EUR) to the seller
You cancel
Paypal then has to reverse the payment to the seller which may take a few days to ensure the seller hasn't shipped out yet
then you have to wait for the $90 from your bank to clear to paypal and then you'd have a positive balance of $90 in your paypal which you could then withdraw
None of this is instantanious

100% this but just because there are issues with the laws doesn't mean we should drop the whole practice.
Only ideas i can think of is working to kill patent trolls where possible. Licensing patent is where people make a killing, should make it illegal and encourage cooperation (ie allowing them to utilize your patent for free) or require it to be sold at fair market value (defined by the intended use) to someone who can actually utilize it rather than having a squatter sit on it until it's applicable and charging exorbitant costs 
Ie if I patent a way to teleport but with current technology it's not feasible due to available knowledge/extreme cost i shouldn't be able to save it for a rainy day if someone else can utilize it now

I think it has nothing to do with how bitcoin users present themselves and more with people spamming the sub with content that doesn't necessarily belong or that's been posted 50 times prior.
Unfortunately I subscribe there and when I browse the new section I either see highly irrelevant content or content that's been posted 100 times within the last hour and generally it's from a non-reputable site.
For example there has been an influx of blogspam claiming the Volkswagen XL1 is banned in the US because it's "too efficient." All of them are from insanely biased websites claiming nothing of fact and spreading bullshit. 
And with the Oculus rift buyout, users were posting articles about people who claimed that they deserved a piece of it or talking about Kickstarter's policies. Not just a few people, but the entire sub was populated with something that's only vaguely related to technology.

I definitely understand the importance of IP on innovation but in my professional career I've had to deal with numerous trolls who bought out overly broad patents with the intention of suing those who come into the space at all even though they themselves never intended to build what they had the patent on

Ports allow traffic to flow directly to the service it is intended for. Your question is like saying "Can I run a web server without opening port 80?" Sure you can but nobody will be able to connect to it because they're pointed at your IP which might have tons of services running.
Port 8333 is used for communication and location of other nodes on the bitcoin network. If it's closed you will not be accepting any inbound connections

I think in that case you'd have a split brain system where MarsCoin and TerraCoin are separate entities running in parallel that can sync up for interplanetary transactions.

When you exchange to earth nodes.

I work with a network monitoring product on a daily basis and figured it would be cool to monitor a node from day 1.
Initially during the sync I didn't have outbound 8333 open so this is why you don't see the out traffic right away.

They ask you to confirm the transaction before it goes through. OP clearly disregard doing actual checking before submitting the buy. Why should coinbase treat his case as a high priority when they did everything they were supposed to yet he failed to do so?
He's responsible for the overage charges because he over drew his own account. He can sell the coin or transfer it or do whatever

Email any company you'd like to buy from and ask if you could buy with bitcoins. I've had companies sell me a gift card for their store for the amount plus shipping I'd owe in bitcoin. Plus it shows interest and might get the store to adopt the payment method. Sometimes an employee will pay with their card and you pay them in coin directly.

So you stole a credit card and want to buy bitcoin? No dice. Any exchange that sells via credit card generally requires photo identification. This is for the consumer's protection as well as the exchange's since once bitcoin is sent to an address (and confirmed) it is un-recoverable. This is the nature of bitcoin, transactions cannot be reversed.

Nodes - relay the transactions to the miners
Miners - Use cryptographic hashing power to ensure the transaction is legitimate and then they relay their piece back to the nodes to be distributed to the network.
Fees do not go to the nodes because the nodes aren't doing anything. And no, they shouldn't be doing anything other than indexing the transactions and relaying to the network.
The miners get the fees in addition to the block reward when they solve a block

You're right the price isn't directly related but generally when you cut the supply (half the bitcoins sold by miners will be available) the price increases. However some have speculated that miners arent selling as many coins already in an attempt to price in the halvening before it happens

Every time bitcoin hits an ATH it's in mainstream media and financial periodicals.

Something with your config is wrong though. Because I literally just downloaded the bitcoind binary to my work mac and ran it and could telnet on the loopback to 8333

You're thinking about this entirely wrong. If they're connecting to your node you're making the network more decentralized by providing another place for them to verify. Just because they are centrally located geographically in a DC (which by the way aws and any decent host would have mutliple DC's) doesn't mean it's less decentralized. And even if they were you are helping the network verify by allowing them to connect to your private node
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:11:06
Considering there's nothing coinbase can do on their end to remove the block no, they really don't have to work with anyone. Tell your relay to unblock coinbase and if they say yes you're golden.
Bounce backs mean nothing if the emails are getting blackholed. For all intents and purposes CB sent the mail out and its no longer their problem. Not to mention my current job has a bounce back/auto reply filter that easily hits 500/day on a slow day and we only allow confirmed business addresses (ie no Gmail, or generics plus they have to be a current customer). If we let every schmuck sign up (like coinbase does) that list would be in the thousands. Why waste time filtering for your shitty relay when it's not their fault?

Please read the [FAQ]( before asking any more questions. I'm happy to answer anything after you've read and understand the basics.
A TL;DR for your question is that each receiving address is a derivative of the private key. You can prove ownership of the coin sent to the address because you hold the private key. Don't share the private key with anyone for this reason
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:56:09

Great logic pal
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:43:51
It was your address 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:33:07
If it's a decent wallet the receiving address will change when a transaction is sent. However what I'm saying is you may not be up to date with the newest block. I'm not sure how exodus works but most desktop wallets need to sync and index the entire blockchain which can take days on a slow connection/not great CPU
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:29:11

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:05
That's an address not a txid but it works:
the coin has been confirmed to be sent to that address. Make sure your wallet is synced and current otherwise you're looking at the address in a previous block before you sent the coin so obviously its not there.

Move to the tools dir


Run the wallet dump

Almost all hosting providers have it written into their AUP.


As in all virtual server environments, CPU cores and disk I/O are shared among multiple VPSs. If your VPS is consistently maxing out one full core or more and impacting the performance of other client servers sharing the same host node, we may ask you to reduce your usage. Load may be generated by CPU usage and/or I/O. Disruptive load may result in a reboot, shutdown, and/or suspension of the VPS regardless of the time lapse involved.
 BUYVM


1,1,1 - Resource Abuse consists of any activity, intentional or otherwise, that consumes sufficient system resources to negatively affect other clients or equipment.
And a bunch of the ones on lowendbox that I've used. Most are cool if you let them know that you're going to only be using max CPU for a short amount of time but you should check with the hoster before you buy their plan to make sure a node is okay
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:50:28

If you ask for help and someone asks you a question it's not really in your best interest to say "reread what I said"
Nodes can generate the addresses on the fly. Your scripting should take care of address generation and linking payment to the transaction amount.
My node sits on a server generates an address pipes it to a QR code tool and then displays this for a user on a totally separate site. The private key is totally separate from the Address which is what you want to accomplish right??

A lot of the time I've seen on my non-flash storage is IO wait while indexing. So I have a feeling if I moved storage to the SSD cache while initially syncing I could index within a day. So copy the chain from another node and you can spin up a new one in a day on old server hardware.

Most people have NAT enabled on their router to translate a single external IP to a bunch of internal ones. Because of this the external IP needs to know where to send traffic for port 8333. This is called forwarding. Essentially you map external port 8333 to your node so when a request hits the external IP it gets forwarded to the node instead of dropped

The OS needs to be on an SD card, you can add an external HDD to one of the USB ports. I recommend getting one with a power adaptor that hooks up to a wall outlet, it's not recommended to use a "portable" one since the Pi may have trouble powering it

I can confirm it's a scam.
They use stolen paypal accounts to transfer funds to your account and then when the person realizes a transaction was made they'll reverse it.
I sent them the minimum to test it out on one of their other sites and received payment. I contacted the individual because it came up as if they were paying me for a purchase (which means paypal took a fee on my end) and they said they'd never heard of the company. They disputed it and paypal came after me which is when I told paypal about the company and they said it's happened before and there's not much they can do except warn people not to use paypal for BTC transactions
They create new sites all the time and then have some obscure "news" site publish an article about it.

Use the $800 to cover some of the debt. Jesus christ why would you buy into an unknown asset when you could pay off debt?!
There's no likely scenario where that $800 turns into $8,000. You will not get rich quick, it's entirely likely you will lose money. Even if BTC goes up to $300 you will only have made $100

The warning is ominous sounding but they're right. Most non-technical people wouldn't know what bitcoin mining is so having it installed is highly likely to be done unintentionally and maliciously as part of a backdoor to turn the victims computer into a miner. It's become somewhat common

Exchanges are where people buy and sell bitcoin at the price they feel is fair.
Maybe I want to sell my bitcoin for $100 higher than anyone else, if there's a buyer at my price point then the last sales price goes up, if there are lower sales it goes down. But since people want to make the most money they target the highest sales price possible
TL;DR this isn't like going to a grocery store and buying a bitcoin. People are buying and selling what they have and the market determines the price. Since those exchanges are their own markets the prices vary

So how about you shut the fuck up and listen to someone else like the guy telling you that money transmitters require ID by government law
@_date: 2015-11-14 19:58:16
This is a hugely common scam. They price the vehicle lower than anything else and in better condition (hint, there's no vehicle) and tell people they're a recently divorced woman, shipping out, or some other story involving why they can't keep the vehicle anymore. Then they say the car is already at the shipper and ebay/amazon/google/other big name company is going to act as an "escrow service" (Note, all of them say they specifically do not do this) and that you'll have 3-30 days to inspect the car and decide to keep it or return it at no charge! Wow, sounds so legit.
But then you get sent to eebay.com or go0gle.com or amaz0n.com and get the same fake invoice with payment instructions.
You can't say for sure whether or not this guy was in on it but who cares, judge Judy pays the damages.
lesson to be learned, STOP BUYING THINGS OF HIGH VALUE SIGHT UNSEEN FROM SKETCHY PLACES. Craigslist says virtually every offer to ship a vehicle is fraudulent... simply googling the email they send you will likely return hundreds of results. In fact, I had a run in with one of these scammers back in 2012...

Just to update you I'm making a new comment.
So Last night at 3:00am I got an email saying they never got my BTC. I immediately thought "welp there goes my money." So this morning I woke up and used their live chat rather than emailing back and forth and I'm guessing the owner of the site is the guy operating the chat because I got the money from a paypal account linked to the name of the person who I was chatting with. They even threw in an extra $7 for the "trouble." $20 deposited in my paypal this morning.
Very very weird and I don't recommend using them for large transfers but if you're willing to chance a few bucks like I was I guess it's worth a shot.
More importantly: if anyone got scammed LET ME KNOW. I have the paypal address, the name of one of the proprietors, an email not linked to their site, and a possible physical address (in Florida) which I checked out and the person does (or did at one point) live there. I'll try my best to help you out
edit: Jesus christ, what a mess. So at around 12:40PM EST I received a payment to my paypal account from a random person in the amount of $300. Since then I've contacted the person, the payment has been disputed and my paypal account is on hold. Now mybitcoinltd.com is contacting me telling me that since they had to process my payment manually their system fucked up and sent me payment for 1BTC and that I should refund the payment or send them a bitcoin or they'll dispute the transaction. The person has finally contacted me back and they do not natively speak English but I've told them I'm contacting paypal to refund the money since I did not solicit it nor do I want it. Do NOT deal with these people, they've fucked up twice and this time it's cost someone $300. Not to mention my paypal account, which I've had since 2007, now has a red mark on it -_-
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:00:10


Wait for 3 confirmations before sending him the card 
Keep in mind, transactions are not reversible. He's likely double spending meaning he sends two transactions with the same coin and makes sure his first payment completes so that yours becomes invalid
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:02:23
This is not a bitcoin question. You need a "shopping cart" script. The payment method is irrelevant but the shopping cart would then provide the link to download anything you want once paid with btc, usd, baht, who cares

The biggest risk I can see it being is they possibly had unsanitized forms and someone used an SQL injection to steal their DB and in the process mucked up their settings.

You can back up your wallet and encrypt it on your phone.

Okay I'll rephrase: Startup overhead was small. Obviously once you start expanding so do your costs.
But the ability to not start off in debt is a HUGE factor in the success of these companies. Most people start a business and make no profit for the first 5 years.

You need to learn the difference between a wallet and an exchange. A wallet is where the coins are stored and generally you will have control of the private key.
And exchange is where you purchase and sell the coins to a company. If you leave your coins in their wallet you do not have control of the private key and are vulnerable to losing your coins if the merchant is hacked or runs off. All exchanges that operate in the US are required to collect information for anti-money laundering purposes
@_date: 2017-05-10 08:15:04
This isn't coinbases fault in the least bit. You lost half of your authentication required for 2 factor auth.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:12:08
You wouldn't put your private keys on the exchange. You'd import the key to a wallet which uses BCCs chain and then send the BCC to an exchange to cash out
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:35:32


That's what a lot of people are saying.
I'm both surprised and not surprised that it happened. Surprised that Evo was the one to go. It was seriously an excellent market place and the founders should have been happy making money off the escrow fees. But they got greedy and when 35 million dollars is sitting in even the most honest person's lap there's not much hope in hell that they won't try to steal it

Not if you're using them properly. I bet if I port scanned a windows machine at random I'd find at least a handful of vulnerabilities. Any firewall that comes configured out of the box is a giant security hole hence why enterprise stuff doesn't come configured at all.
Web browsers are only able to do that when they've crawler vulnerable sites and users have reported them malicious. This happens to non-malicious sites so you can bet they miss a lot of the malicious ones.
You should still be careful where you enter your payment information. I actually had a lady today deposit $300 into my PayPal account by accident. 
My point is, the risk when it comes to Financials on the Internet is always with the individual

Their certificate was valid from 3/16/14 to 3/19/15. It expired today.
This simply means they haven't paid their bill or have decided not to renew their certificate with Avast.
Chances are it's the legitimate site but I'd hold off exchanging any money for the time being
Keep in mind, TLS is still active and your communication between the server is encrypted, the only issue is we don't know if the private key has been compromised and the certificate revoked which is unlikely to happen the same day it expires

The same way it's handled with dollar bills. If you try to put dollar bills with serial numbers that correlate to a recent bank robbery the bank has every right to protect its interest and not accept the money. So do exchanges.
Can you take those stolen dollar bills over to a sandwich shop and spend them? Sure they probably won't be looking for stolen serial numbers.
The exchange has every right to not accept stolen bitcoin. If all the exchanges agree then that's that the market has decided.

What do you mean by successfully also trade? I initiated a withdrawl two days ago and I was sketched out that it was taking so long but wasn't suspicious until I heard about the exit scam, checked my wallet and voila March 17th at 2:00pm I got my bitcoin. Im pretty sure I just cheated death a bit and won't be buying a lotto ticket anytime soon.
What you're describing already happened. Can't remember the name of the market but the site went down for whatever reason but everyone was refunded

Seized, then it came out they laundered the bitcoin from Gox
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:09:58
Right, but since the wallet is on the node (yes I could always import the keys elsewhere) would I be able to send transactions from the node on both chains?

Oh yeah, I bought tons of shit off of Evo before the most recent one got refunded due to the vendor not feeling safe anymore. Perhaps they had a premonition of things to come.
I don't see why you should be able to store funds in an account at all. Transfer the BTC for whatever you're buying to a temporary wallet that's held in escrow by the site and then when it finalizes, the wallet (with the exception of a small escrow fee) is turned over to the vendor who should immediately move it to their other wallets. This minimizes the amount of time it's in the market administrators hands making such a LARGE exit scam impossible
