I think you're thinking of goats. What's the current cow/goat ratio at the moment?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:05:40
This is exactly how I feel about it. Opinions are like assholes.

As evidenced by the 50£ I think he's pretty new at life (teen)

You jump into a black hole, you just end up in some other dumpy universe. One with a more, a more improvised feel to it.

Buy if you believe in bitcoin. Hold if you have bitcoin. Sell if you need money.

Welcome to Reddit, where the points are made up and everybody is a bot but you.

That episode was terrible. The rest are gold bars or golden nuggets in comparison.

What is this? A gif with sound!?

I sold some. We should see a massive correction as all the Demon Tribe of Azgor follow suit and we all dance around in the flames of fire chanting "Ooh Ra Ra" to summon hell incarnate. That or because God hates me. To the bottom we ride!

Yes it will be a meteoric rise once LN is taken out of testing stages.

Try sage. It's supposed to be holier than shit.

But you just pay them, don't brag about having millions of dollars or whatever. This conversation is the dumbest thing I've participated in all year lol

Why is there a picture of a knockoff Daria as the thumbnail?

You spelled HODL very strangely

Well you have to buy them for starters /s

We could make a religion out of this

No, you could make up to 1000x your investment. Shorting at crash levels is actually an incredible amount of money, but shorting can be risky too, because if it doesn't go down to substantial levels, you can essentially lose money by having to pay back the debt. Best case in that scenario is you stop-loss your short after a certain amount of debt is accrued. The upper movement would probably be limited once the market (if the market) becomes $1 trillion, which would mean profits of 7x are possible if big money moves in. So there's actually more range going downward at this point.
