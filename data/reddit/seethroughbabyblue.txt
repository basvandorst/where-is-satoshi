Very true sir

BMR man, BMR. Not irrelevant in this sub or this discussion. But, I agree with JackDostoevsky: fuck BofA

You articulated well how I see btc not as a replacement FIAT currency but an alternative free from the rampant graft and corruption of the Fed, IMF, World Bank and the private banks. It isn't the future of daily sales, but it is going to shift the balance of power from the Gov-t/Banking sector to the faceless masses. Just consider the effort required to maintain fair lobbying in DC as thinktanks realize the power of btc. I made my 20k speculating, I'm out but follow for a hobby, and I'm intrigued by how destabilized the world econ will be when btc stabilizes and major exchanges have to consider it. These next few years will be exciting.

Nor can you buy fractions of bitcoin, and withdrawls may take 48 hours :(
@_date: 2013-03-04 06:27:57
Haha, like to see a response to this
@_date: 2013-01-08 15:38:13
Eh, shipping illegal stuff doesn't worry me. Shipping unregistered assault rifles to felons does. I'm all about the 2nd amendment but this country does have a serious problem with gun crimes, and stuff like BMR only makes it worse

Make it 2-1/2D, like simcity or civ. My comp is decent (3.2 dual core with 8gb RAM and a ati5870 (i think) which I thought would run eve but not even close. Weird because I ran Skyrim at over 60 FPS. But yeah, go a tad oldschool, maybe like Age of Empires or Total War, with a bitcoin econmy built in. And allow betting. You want people to play, allow gambling.
@_date: 2013-01-08 13:23:59
I was not aware that was the origin of the site. Holy shit. As a 25 year old who blew hundreds of my parents dollars in middle school playing Magic, that completely changes my attitude towards MtGox
@_date: 2013-01-08 17:22:36
It does seem like there is a possibility that ASIC isn't gonna happen at all, but who knows? Seems like all I hear is silence, bullshit and speculation.
@_date: 2013-01-08 13:38:42
Well I actually just moved across the country two months ago, and don't know anyone really, so I plan on looking into it. It'll be a cool way to meet some people. I had no idea people still played, and I bet I've got a TON of catching up to do, but I'm sure I can google myself an updated rulebook, edition, etc. Thanks for the heads up, I'm legitimately excited

Having lost 20BTC last week (got myself up to 41, but couldn't step back and lost it all) I cannot upvote this enough. I have a job, my coin is not for income. Lesson learned
@_date: 2013-01-08 13:31:41
I'm actually gonna root around for my box, some couple thousand cards, when I get a chance this afternoon. I haven't even THOUGHT about Magic in years. Totally gonna get stoned and relearn/remember how to play, and find someone to get a game going! This makes my day.
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:56:27
Thats cute
@_date: 2013-01-08 16:22:54
Right, guns don't kill people, either? and kalashnikovs are for hunting? 
@_date: 2013-01-08 02:34:31
MtGox's front page prominently uses a quote from Wikipedia as a selling point. While MtGox is a legit company, that kind of looks a little unprofessional to me...
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:55:47
He certainly did. That doesn't mean its not crooked. I also hope you're not implying that he was an unwitting participant in distributing stolen goods. He created the site for the sole purpose of making money off of the distribution of goods that he had no license to distribute, and whether the law says that is right or wrong is irrelevant to the discussion. Theft is theft.
@_date: 2013-04-29 03:53:32
What's US Law say about opening a bank based in a non-domestic currency (as FDIC is like to consider btc)? Would we be back at a MtGox-like exchange where money is held in fiat until traded to bitcoin? If so, why keep said bitcoin in Credit Union account? I like cryptocurrency solely because I can legitimately avoid paper trail (and I finally sold my first purcase, 100 btc at $6 sold between $200-$220 via localbit to avoid taxes) and am excited about the possibility of a real showdown between private and public opinions on currency, and even more intriguing will be the deeper delved books on who fundamentally owns currency. As currency is such an esoteric idea, the philosophy that will be discussed about the bitcoin revolution may have far-reaching ramifications for human culture. This is an exciting time.
But, I believe you start a BTC credit union, then the regulations start. There is a reason many churches refuse all federal aid: with any help or support they tie another string around you. Stay out of the gov't and keep them out, hell if they ban it the better. If Gov't gets involved, after a bunch of good intentions btc will be nationalized, Bernanke will say screw it to the finite supply, and Greenspan will triumphantly return to misjudge btc and hedge the west coast on it, and there goes our shot at breaking the IMF/World Banks predatory power, let alone turning this country back into a first world country.
End Rant. I Feel Better. Please, Downvote twice if you disagree, I know y'all nigs got throwaways

See, I agree with you there, but from a completely different standpoint: I don't believe in the necessity of a standing army to begin with, nor do I believe our police forces need to be armed well enough to invade third world countries. I'm all for the right to own a gun, but I don't think that means any gun, nor do I think that means any citizen. I consider a pistol or shotgun more than adequate for self defense, unless you are defending yourself from our police forces, who I believe are far over-armed to begin with.
@_date: 2013-03-05 00:04:21
Hardly, but if you're naive enough to buy that rot I can only chuckle
@_date: 2013-01-08 17:28:02
What do you consider "properly armed" if I may ask?
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:36:21
I've used ziggap via a BofA deposit this week, though to a different account, and it was quick and the fee was a bit lower than BitInstant
@_date: 2013-01-04 22:56:31
Yeah, I know about that but the nearest Chase bank (not ATM) is about 30 min further than nearest moneygram, so I generally go with that
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:16:24
Huh, weird. thanks, why's it not appear in blockchain?
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:12:28
I don't know but I'm kinda worked up... Sent a bet that now has 27 confirmations and haven't been able to find a thing. Satoshi itself being down worries me.
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:50:44
It feels more sustainable, with the recent outpouring of press and adoption, but I'm worried about a lot of pump and dumps causing a scare. My savings wallet is all from $8, and I'm in for a while, so I'll be good, but I think it'll hold yet.
@_date: 2013-01-04 16:08:45
Ok, so I bought the SLL's, then bought BTC, now when I withdraw my BTC it says a "manual" review has to take place and my coin will be deposited within 48 hrs, since I have a new account. Is this normal? and does it generally take a full two days to go through?
@_date: 2013-01-08 17:58:21
I wholeheartedly agree about equal force. I just don't like the way the military-industrial complex has brought our local police departments into the arms races.
@_date: 2013-01-08 18:23:03
See, we can agree on basic principles. We the people should be as well armed as our government, now more than ever as this country is starting to feel like it's under occupation. But yeah, my local sheriff sure as hell doesn't need a tank, a drone or any of that shit. Hell, regardless of how you felt about the Occupy protests (I'm ambivalent myself), seeing those cops walking around more weaponized than our soldiers in Iraq has to worry you. And don't get me started on drones; Anwar Al-Awlaki (I know I spelled it wrong) may have been a terrorist, but I don't like the precedent set of killing an American citizen without a trial and conviction, and sentencing. Now the military can detain citizens indefinitely? 
No, I believe you are right in saying we need to be equally armed, but I think we need to achieve that by a drastic reduction in weapons made available for police use.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:41:51
Would you consider someone who sells stolen stereos knowingly, even if he didn't steal them himself, a crook? I would.
*to clarify, while he didn't steal anything, he made his money by profiting off distributing stolen goods. That's crooked in my book. Period. Way different than torrenting a movie and watching it at home, IMHO.
@_date: 2013-01-04 22:17:03
You say this has happened multiple times(6 of 24)? So I should expect this to be an issue for future transactions (not just first) as well? If so, might stick with BitInstant cash depos
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:04:45
Resistance is futile!
@_date: 2013-01-08 01:41:05
in regards to credit card use over the internet


Holy shit. I knew that it was a good chunk of change, but damn. Stats like this make me believe in the staying power and ultimate inevitability of BTC as a major currency
@_date: 2013-01-08 17:00:58
thats cute
@_date: 2013-01-08 05:34:33
I believe that. Immoral as all hell, but I believe it. That is the main reason I believe in the future of BTC: in an internet age, how secure and instantaneous transactions occur make it the logical successor to paypal and its ilk
@_date: 2013-01-08 03:25:53
BMR (black market reloaded) is an underground, illegal .onion that specializes in firearms, weapons, and the like, delivered right to your door. BTC is the currency they use. I've checked it out, just for kicks, but I'm totally opposed to the idea of a marketplace where assault rifles are sold to people w/out any background checks or anything like that. Really scares me, since other commerce on there is also morally questionable (child porn, for example) so the people on there aren't the people I necessarily trust with heavy weaponry.
@_date: 2013-01-08 04:19:28
I think its hilarious. And sourcing Wikipedia? C'mon guys, at least put some effort into looking more professional...
@_date: 2013-01-04 03:36:19
awesome. fuck that second life stuff, but it'd be cool to turn this paypal into btc
@_date: 2013-01-08 15:59:05
but "THIS IS THE REAL GAME CHANGER IN THIS MINGING GAME." I've gotta say, Tom sounded way more coherent before he started his own forum. That was unreadable; 15 year old Nigerian scammer sounds about right given the syntax, incoherence and rambling promises without any info. I think you're right though; I think a few folks pulled the ole Ponzi scheme, and I'm glad I've just avoided mining entirely. I just don't feel confident in my knowledge to invest, and I bet this isn't the only one that pops up.
