I've actually started a project similar to this called TimeVault. It's early stages, and hasn't moved beyond a small circle of friends for now, but you're welcome to download my wallet here, if you're using chrome: TimeVault.xyz
My proposal is to build a social network that connects people with projects. My token will divide itself into two parts: Time &amp; Experience. The faster you complete a task, the more experience you get. The slower, the more time you receive. Only time is spendable, where as experience accumulates. New abilities unlock on the site, dependent on how much Experience you have earned on a particular skill set. It's like your profiles personal rating system. Higher XP lets you work on higher paying tasks, create tasks yourself, create projects, do crowd funding, vote on changes to the community, and etc. Of course, off the site you can spend your time however you'd like, just like any other altcoin.
Mining would take place through Proof-of-Participation. There would be certain tasks you could do for the community itself, which would result in you being paid. The community will vote on what these tasks will be. I'd like to base them around charity. You want to build a website or an app, but don't have enough experience on the site to take on a high enough paying job? Go volunteer at a participating food bank for a weekend, or donate plasma. You'll generate blocks of time &amp; experience for your efforts, and can then hire the people you need to work on your project.
Time is our greatest currency. It's naturally scarce, valuable anywhere in the world, and you're already spending it everyday, one second at a time. TimeVault improves upon the quality of where you spend your time by providing incentive &amp; accountability. Thats what makes it better.
