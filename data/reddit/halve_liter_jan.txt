Like the first part, not so much the part on regulations. Would be much stronger if he left that out.
Automobiles and the internet are regulated, so will crypto currencies be if wants to make a claim on real society.

I work at a large financial services firm and I am banned from owning securities/stocks in a lot of companies on account of ‘independence’ rules. I have to sign acknowledgment forms on a monthly basis. Can imagine that it works the same way with these banks and crypto.
Further to the subject, I don’t think it is a ban on crypto in a way that they intentionally want to slow down adoption or anything, I think that Bitcoin just isn’t at a level that they can get it through their internal risk and acceptance policies in order to be able to recommend or advice it to clients. Think that the SEC still not approving has a lot to do with it. This is a very legalized world, and banks and financial companies are very risk aversive, especially if it comes down to avoiding possible future claims from clients. They will never advise any unapproved asset, no matter how good of an opportunity they may think it is. If, as an employee, you would recommend such unapproved assets, yes, you will get fired.

The risk is that you fail to sell above your buy - either because you didn’t sell or because it didn’t reach a higher price. You buy at 9k and then waste a lifetime holding.

Also, non crypto owners, who are still the vast majority of new consumers, like news that crypto is doing bad better.
