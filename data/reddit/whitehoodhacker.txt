If you want to add any of these designs to your wallet, follow these steps:  
1. Download [Pass2U]( from the App Store.
2. Open the app and navigate to the Pass Store. Search “Address Card”.
3. All the designs should appear.
Note that if you want to create your own custom design, you’ll need to pay $2 for the pro version. Let me know in the comments if there are any suggestions or coins you would like.  
Another note: balances don’t automatically update, you will have to edit them yourselves. It’s there for the aesthetics!
To access Apple Wallet from the lock screen, make sure:  
A. You have enabled Wallet lock screen access in passcode settings  
B. You have added the Wallet icon to your control center

You can update the address at any time in the settings. In addition, you can setup a separate wallet for receiving transactions otg.

Obviously, this wouldn't be something you use in everyday crypto transactions. It's meant to be used when you're on the fly and need to summon a receiving address, which is difficult to do if you only have a desktop wallet and no mobile wallet.

This was already in Workflow.
For those who don’t know, Shortcuts is literally Workflow.

It doesn’t apply for you then.

If you didn’t initiate these transactions, you should immediately contact Coinbase. The new verification levels do not talk about moving Bitcoin.

Wal-mart has been legally changed to Walmart.

They just started applying changes. They’re doing it by individual accounts. If you managed to get your funds out, you got lucky!

It always gets higher.  
I cry every time when I find an iPhone 6 running for $0.01 and come back two days to at $150.

The Bitcoin mining pool has an option to extract to Coinbase with no fees... but I’ll guess I have to withdraw to my normal BTC wallet with fees now :(
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:17:32
That’s KFC mate.

I actually believe in McAfee’s vision. I just decided to meme it for lolz.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:26:26
No it’s not “always so”. You could use their service as a wallet back then. Now, if you never uploaded an ID, your Bitcoins are stuck.

I use a good ol’ fashioned PC wallet. I copied the recovery phrase, then deleted the wallet.
I consider myself lucky because I had just emptied out my Coinbase to cold-storage a week ago. I only lost $0.14 USD in Bitcoin Cash lol. However, it’s definitely not a laughing matter for other users who lost thousands.
When they said “don’t keep your Bitcoin on a web wallet”, I certainly didn’t think they meant this...

“I’m more profile of these 750,000,000 new V-Bucks I bought”
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:47:36
Fees must be outrageous though.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:50:27
Coinbase is hardly a scam, but they’re coming down hard on customers.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:27:22
IMO, hardware wallets are too expensive and not worth buying. I use an Electrum cold-storage (created wallet in isolated VM, destroyed it after I got the recovery phrase) and encrypted the seed.
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:55:01
Fair enough! If people don’t want to spend money on hardware wallets, an Electrum cold-storage is the next best option (for security)!
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:43:55
I dunno. I guess December 31st at 11:59 PM counts.   
Bitcoin at a million dollars for New Year’s would be amazing.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:29:59
Paper wallets are only complicated in the sense that they may be lost or you could potentially screw up. If you’re unsure, use a desktop wallet, such as Electrum. If you want to go farther, look up “cold storage Bitcoin wallet”.  
Good luck!

No it means right now, the current price of Bitcoin is below what is needed for Bitcoin to steadily reach 1 million. It doesn’t necessarily mean that Bitcoin won’t reach 1 million. It was holding off, but for the first time, it dipped below the prediction line. That’s why I memed it.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:26:08
You seem to be missing the point. The reason they can’t withdraw is because they need a US ID to verify.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:20:22
Verifying your identity for KYC destroys the point of Bitcoin; it was created for anonymity.
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:06:09
This is news; not a personal crisis I’m dealing with it (I only lost a dollar).  
I’m simply informing others so that way they can take action and move their crypto if they don’t want to verify.

Most wallets have a "max send" option which will send your Bitcoin and deduct transaction fees as necessary. If that's not the case, try inputting your entire balance to send to the other address. If the transaction goes through, you're set, and if it doesn't work out, you'll still be fine because the transaction failed and the Bitcoins will remain in your original wallet. You can use a tool to determine the amount of BTC you need to deduct to send as a transaction fee.

Cause gift card trading is sketchy af and balances can get revoked for violating terms of service.

How is this different then, say, DAI?

After their policy change to KYC due to new laws in their country, I suspect their volume may drop significantly.

I used Coinizy a while back to verify my PayPal account. It doesn't work anymore though. I think it ended up as a scam.

oh look, another stupid ICO.

The price went *dooooooown* since last December.
