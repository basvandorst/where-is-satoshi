also, I did an international wire only beginning of March and it took 10 days to get to the Euro account. Normally they take 3-5 days.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:52:32
Unforuntately not as they confirmed they received the payment. Before I sent it they told me it would be 2 days before they would credit my account. They got the payment the very next day I sent it. It ended up being a week before it was credited to my account and within that time the price had changed so much I didn't want to buy there.
I did an international transfer to Bitstamp the same day and they credited to my account before Cavirtex and I'm in Canada. Considering the trade fee is so much higher with Cavirtex I would expect a better service. I recall something about them saying they were just defrauded by a large amount recently so were being extra cautious. Which is fine but don't say one thing and then after I did the transfer change it.

I'm not concerned about an email address being exposed. I am concerned that they could get my full name from coinbase by having an email address. Does that not bother you?
Again, these things happen, but don't deflect the responsibility of your own security flaws or privacy flaws that were intended designs on the users themselves.

Actually steps where removed but you choose to ignore them thinking everything must be converted back to some form of government backed currency. And when steps are removed you choose to pass over it by saying well the guy is earning enough he doesn't need to convert.
The difference for the 2nd guy mentioned is that he is on control of what he does with his bitcoins. He can convert some to cash now, wait, trade, buy other stuff, anything. And the benefit is nobody can tell him what to do with his coins. With PayPal it would take 3-5 days to get your money into your bank account (from my experience) and they do quite frequently freeze accounts and keep your money frozen for months for spurious reasons. Also, the payment could be reversed by the sender. Plus he saves the paypal commission which is considerably more than Bitstamp's trading commission. But if he chooses to sell on localbitcoins he would probably make an extra 5%.

Bitstamp did the same thing to my friend last month or so. He deposited coins and has never done a fiat deposit or withdrawal. He just trades small amounts (less than 0.1 btc). His account now needs to be verified before he can withdraw his coins or trade again. He will verify but he is pissed about not being given any notice or the chance to just withdraw his coins. I've had good experience with Bitstamp though but I am fully verified (although had to do a 2nd verification a year later which I didn't like as it held up my already delayed deposit for an extra day or two.).
I know Gox did the same thing and it would not surprise me if this is just a coin grab by some exchanges as those with small amounts on deposit don't really want to be given their identities to some of these exchanges in foreign countries, especially with all the leaks that seem to happen.
My own experience with Cavirtex is they hold your fiat deposits longer than needed (and what they tell you they will before you do the deposit) so you cannot buy coins within a reasonable time period which means the price can change significantly. After that happened I stopped using them.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:44:12
Ok, understand and I do understand the point you are making. I just find that issue of cashing out isn't much of a drawback these days and will only get better.
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:09:18
They don't have to sell anything if they do not want to. That is akin to saying you must sell your "cash" into bank account numbers for it to be usable. Right now bitcoin is usable although it far from being every day usable.
And if they choose they can either sell it (bitstamp/localbitcoins etc) or keep it and re-use or hold for investment. I've seen a mixed bag. I have one guy who just holds on to his coins as a long term of investment and another who immediately cashes it out on either bitstamp or localbitcoins. The latter prefers payment this way as it can't be reversed by me later and by using bitstamp it's pretty much the same as using paypal with a lot less fees and no risk of chargeback/refund.
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:17:38
he converts back on bitstamp usually, doesn't mean he withdraws it to his bank account.
Unless someone spends it, they are storing it, USD or Bitcoin, doesn't matter. So don't really understand this point.
Yes it takes less time than paypal. If I do a withdrawal on Bitstamp the funds are usually in my account within 3 days. On PayPal the quickest I have ever got my funds was 5 days. Also, you have the option to selling your bitcoins for cash on localbitcoins at slightly above market price but if you want cash quickly you can sell at market price and you will get a buyer who gives you cash or does a bank deposit the same day. I've done it myself several times without any issues.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:24:09
I've been paying all my sub-contractors (I'm a web developer) in bitcoin for the past year and half. It's worked out great.
The volatile price of bitcoin doesn't affect it too much as we agree a price in dollars/euro first and if that is 1 bitcoin or 1.2 bitcoins at the time of payment it is still the same amount of dollars/euro we agreed on.
It's still pretty amazing paying some and seconds later they have it in their wallet as pending and within 10 minutes it is confirmed for basically a zero transfer fee.
Now if only I could get my clients to pay me in btc I'd be even happier.
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:42:58
Thanks, I will check it out. I generally do only one CAD to EUR transfer a month though.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:30:22
It obviously does.
@_date: 2014-04-02 07:14:42
And do you not think that is a problem? i.e. anyone can get your full name from an email address on coinbase and thus verify you havean account there? When I signed up with coinbase I can't recall this feature or being informed about it. In fairness though I only logged in once around when they first launched.
But that isn't really what upsets me personally, what upsets me is instead of holding up their hands and saying "sorry, our mistake, we will fix it" they are deflecting it to the user by saying well someone must have gort your email address from another site which isn't proven right now. I've googled the email address but cannot find it anywhere or in any other leaks I've seen so far.

Sure, but most my my contractors would be in the Euro zone or want USD. I'm in Canada. So don't you think Bitcoin could help with that?

Just an aside, do you mean Euro transfers when you say your bank transfers are free? They are free and take 1-3 days from my experience. If you want a same day transfer though it will cost 12.50 (my bank anyway) and may not get there until the next business day.
I also do transfers from Canada to Europe a lot and each time it costs me $45 plus the exchange rate is horrible usually.

I sell coins on localbitcoins and one of my previous customers asked to buy 10 bitcoins today about 2 hours ago. I sold all my coins a few days ago so only had cash in my mtgox account. So I bought them on gox and did the withdrawal as I always do. Usually it appears in my wallet as pending within a minute or two at most and then confirmed by the blockchain within 10 minutes as per usual.
This time however it has not been sent by gox at all yet. I got the confirmation on the withdrawal screen with the transaction id but it does not appear in the blockchain and thus has not been actually sent by mtgox. All the details were correct including my receiving address. I paid the transaction fee also.
I'm assuming they are manually approving all btc withdrawals now as this has never happened before. I have a verified account. Not very happy about this as I've arranged to meet my buyer at 8 pm and it's 5.20 pm now. I submitted a support request but I don't expect a reply until tomorrow.

won't necessarily make them unavailable, they may just be very very slow. This would appear as lag for sites like bitcoinity using MtGox's api.
I would say that any significant kind of lag should halt trading on any platform and just shut down all trading or maybe put limits on the type of trades maybe.

Running a contest for a Loft / Condo in the Beaches area of Toronto, Canada. Valued at around $580,000 CDN.
Please see my previous post as I had to change it from a raffle to a contest to remain legal:
The contest is provably fair with all result hashes published now and with each ticket bought the result changes so very difficult for me to game/cheat. Runner-up prizes and an Early Bird Draw too.
Was originally going to try to sell it for Bitcoin but thought this would be better.
Good luck to anyone that enters and feel free to ask me any questions or if anyone in Toronto wants to come see the place and verify it's legit please just make contact.

I just got scammed 5Bitcoins/$600 using localbitcoins today. Will create a detailed post later. Only reason I decided to try the localbitcoins route was of mtgox limits (even though I'm verified) and the time it takes for withdrawals to appear.

Only opened it back up tonight as I had to change it. The 3 entries are from when I started it on Thursday for a couple of hours. I refunded their tickets and gave them free entry because of the changes.

If I can do it I will do it. I've no problem verifying the place is mine with a leading member of the Bitcoin community or anyone who buys a ticket. I bought it pre-construction in 2005.

The way satoshidice works they can keep the server running the bet processing software confidential and may not even be accessible via a webpage. All that server needs to see is the blockchain transactions so it can process the bets. It might run it's own bitcoin client (probably) or it could even use blockchain.info to see all transactions for it's own bets.
The webpage itself could be hosted on a completely different server in another country as all it is doing is showing the bet addresses. Similar to if satoshidice posted the bet addresses here on reddit.
They might also have separate systems/servers for hot wallets and payments.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:29:12

You can buy bitcoins at coinbase if your in the US, probably simplest method for you:
If you buy $1 USD of bitcoins and the value of bitcoin goes down, then you only lose money if you trade back the bitcoins to USD. Like any currency, it will go up, and it will go down. Reason bitcoin is very volatile is because it's very new and adoption is still in it's infancy. So you have the potential of making lots of profit, not just 100%, but in factors of x10, x20 and so on. Some say 1 bitcoin could be worth thousands in years to come. But you never know and you should expect to lose everything.
So don't invest what you don't have or can't afford. It's a very interesting technology and once you start using it to pay people or buy stuff with and see how simple it actually is, you will probably fall in love with it, like I have.

The raffle is not for bitcoins, but a condo in this case and other items if users want to raffle their stuff.
Nobody should trust me other than I've put the address up their along with my number and I will do everything in public including the draw and hopefully get someone high profile from the bitcoin community to verify and do the draw live on webcam.
Reason I can't come up with a provable fair drawing is because I don't know how many people will enter. I have been thinking about it for the past month but can't figure it out other than setting a limit on the raffle tickets sold and just keep doing draws until a winner is found. Open to suggestions.
EDIT: Another thing is if I did have it provable then I would know what the winning ticket/id would be in advance which would mean I could probably cheat somehow by telling my friends and familly to start buying tickets near that id number.

@_date: 2013-03-11 20:13:00
I use bitstamp myself. He is just cagey about using sites not based in Ireland I guess. Plus I know for sure he doesn't want to give a foreign company verification details so mtgox and bitcoin-central is out.
For people unsure about Bitcoin it can be very difficult for them to trust in sending their money across waters for now. This will change.

I didn't think Cavirtex did Interac transfers to clients? I'm a verified user there but haven't actually sold or withdrawn there.
I got scammed with a localbitcoins trade and Interac. I called my bank first to verify it could not be reversed, they told me it could not and I could send the goods/bitcoins. I did, 2 days later it was reversed as fraud and my own account was frozen without me being notified by my bank. The unfroze it when I called and apologised for not notifying me and their staff telling me an interac could not be reversed. Now I'm waiting the outcome of an investigation. Anyways.

Not sure if this is the case but I know when you first set-up a site with cloudflare they set-up automatic sub-domains and if the site owner forgets to remove them or make them cloudflare protected, then an attacker can get the backend ip that way. Happened to me the first time I used cloudflare.
Also, if you use the same server for mail as you do for your site then an attacker can get the backend ip that way too. That trips a lot of people up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:10
How do you know their trading platform isn't already? I would have assumed they would have any sensitive servers not publicly facing and the publicly facing servers, the ones customers interact with, are the ones being DDoS'd.
Even if you put important systems in an area of your network that cannot be DDoS'd, you still need public systems so customers can access the service. If these public systems are being DDoS'd, this will create the same problems your seeing.
I'm getting the impression you think the MtGox trading engine is on one dedicated box with a public facing ip? And if it is and you are correct then there are a lot more problems than being DDoS'd.

This all just happened to me since Thursday (only found out today). Wish I had of seen this before. Was trying to convert to pay my bills and used localbitcoins for the first time. I called up my bank, BMO, and they told me on the phone that once I deposit the funds into my account the sender cannot reverse. Yeah, that what they said. I told the bank employee what I was doing and they said it was fine to go ahead and again it could not be reversed. Today my account was frozen without even telling me and my card would not work. Lost 5 bitcoins/$600+ dollars although it's pending an investigation and the police are being brought in.

I just checked their facebook page and I assume this is the post you mean:
"There are a few things that we can implement to help fight the attacks, such as disconnecting the trade engine backend from the Internet. By separating the data center from the Mt.Gox website, we will continue to be able to trade."
This would indicate what you say but it would not also surprise me if whoever wrote that didn't understand how their own systems worked/were designed. Nevertheless, if they had the trading platform or database server open to anyone on the internet then that is a problem within itself in terms of security.
As to "Yes you do, and no, you won't see trade lag of this magnitude." I would argue you that are incorrect. A large enough attack can take out entire networks/datacenters, nevermind a couple of servers. And if the network is taken out you won't just have lag, you will have actual downtime. Again, the only way to solve this is by making sure your network can absorb what is coming. I've personally seen large DDoS attacks that have clogged up traffic to a datacenter and thus stopped all access to any customers within.
They said they are using Prolexic which are one of the leading companies in DDoS protection/mitigation so I'm sure they will be helping them sort out any internal scalability issues too.
To fix their issues they need to make sure they not only have front end scalability to cope with normal traffic and DDoS traffic, but also back-end scalability so all the front ends can communicate with their database/trading platform in a timely fashion. Without them giving the techincal details of the attack size it's pretty hard to know if the issues is just their own systems being designed not to scale or if the DDoS is so massive that without have datacenters like google or facebook they just can't cope. Although anyone with servers in the same datacenter may be able to shed light on whether or not they have been affected during these DDoS attacks. If not, then the datacenter can handle the bandwidth/attack size and the problem lies with mtgox's system.

I'll host you on one of my servers for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:36:11
cool thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:05:57
I've started offering all my clients 20% discount if they pay me in Bitcoins. And I try to pay for jobs I sub out in bitcoins. I can't wait for the day I can go across to the store and buy some milk using my Bitcoins on my phone.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:16:52
I know
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:59:59
ouch. poor guy.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:24:34
2) I'm not Canadian but bought a place here. Toronto is a good city and the prize can always be sold I guess if you didn't want it.
3) I've been racking my brains about this for the past month. I've actually written some provable numbers games but I cannot figure out how to do a raffle when I don't know how many will buy a ticket.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:46:24
Hey and thanks for asking,
There is a minimum reserve which I've lowered from 5,000 to 2,750 in the past week with the rate of bitcoins going up so high. It's on the page under minimum reserve.
If the minimum reserve is not met then all entry fee's will be refunded back to the entrants wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:01:15
yeah can do that to.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:29:27
I never liked the left one but if it's more valuable he stays.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:07:08
1) sorry, I misunderstood.
2) I have no problem verifying the deeds with anyone from the bitcoin community and will do so a.s.a.p. Plus if anyone who bought a ticket is in Toronto and wants to see the place they are more than welcome and I will verify I won the place then too :)
3) If you can point me in the right direction about this as I cannot figure out how to do it for a raffle. I know for numbers games like satoshidice etc but not this. Again, am open to ideas.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:21:46
I will reduce the reserve if the price keeps shooting up. I had an offer for the loft last summer in the region of $570K CAD to give you an idea. Once I get about 500k in reserver at the current btc value I will reduce as need be.
This is an experiment really.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:56:17
Cloudflare is real DDoS protection if you pay for it. The free service offers a basic service but if you get a real significant attack they will route traffic directly to you instead of protecting. You have to pay the $200 or $3000 month enterprise to get real protection and I would put it on par if not above Prolexic right now due to the size of their network. I've clients with both.
Edit: Also, that message only appears when you set your cloudflare settings to Under Attack mode so the cloudflare network then checks the browser to see it's a real person and not a bot.

Ok, 20 minutes after posting this I just received the bitcoins into my local wallet which is about 2 1/2 hours after the withdrawal. So I got them but something is either gone wrong or mtgox are going manual withdrawal approvals. If this is a new thing I would appreciate knowing in advance.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:29:39
great. Signed up and going to start testing. When your live I'm ready to trade as I'm in Toronto :)
@_date: 2013-02-20 02:18:26
nice house. Good luck. I tried to post my condo on bitcointalk but I can't figure out how to post. I assume because it's a brand new account and to prevent spam.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:32:09
ahh cool. I set-up an account already so going to try it out soon. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:17:09
Have you tried using Bitcoins yet, I mean buy one and pay for something with them or transfer them to another person or a 2nd wallet? It was after I did my first wallet to wallet transfer I realised how groundbreaking the technology behind all this is and it really could change the world for the better, especially the poor.
Why I am saying this? Because if you believe in it then investing longterm is going to pay off. But don't just invest, actually use the currency to pay for things at the same time to help drive the economy and thus your investment up in value.
If your looking to make quick money, you might be lucky, you might be unlucky. I'm a horrible day trader myself and am in it for the longterm. Just don't invest any more than you can live with losing. If Bitcoins become what everyone seems to think they will, then $1,000 will be plenty to give you a very very good reward long term (2-3 years).

Just to update here, after getting legal advice I will be cancelling the raffle and instead replacing it with a skilled based contest with an entry fee. I'm still pushing ahead with this but need to make sure we don't break any local laws in Canada. The contest will be completely fair and involved third parties in order to guarantee fairness.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:46:00
Hi everyone, just to give a quick update. This is still going ahead. I should have more details either tomorrow or Monday at the latest. Just working out how to make the contest simple and fair and hopefully as transparent as possible. It will probably be something along the lines of first to answer 3 general knowledge questions wins on the contest date at a certain time.
Before I took down the address 3 tickets where purchased within the first few hours and I've refunded 2 already and the third will be refunded tomorrow once I put some btc in that wallet to cover the transaction fees so they are not out funds and get a full refund.
The site got a lot of visitors too which I hope is a good sign.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:05:29
try now.
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:16:25
Serious? I always got my btc withdrawals showing within minutes. Not hours.
Also, just after I received the coins I got a response from support asking me to send them the following:
--SNIP SNIP--
Thank you for contacting us. Before we may action your request we require the following information:
Mt.Gox Username:
Sending Address:
Receiving Address:
Date/Time of Transfer:
Best regards,
--SNIP SNIP--
I submitted the support request already logged in so I don't understand how they do not know my information already? Also, how am I to know the sending address of a withdrawal request?
I just don't know anymore.
@_date: 2013-06-21 03:11:19
I'm not far off 10k in spins :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:59:45
good catch. Reason I thought of doing this was I saw one of the news shows here in Toronto do a story about an Ontario couple of raffled their home. Also the fact it's for Bitcoins rather than Canadian dollars might make a difference.
But I'll double check it tomorrow to make sure.
Edit: Been checking online and it may need to be changed to a game of skill. I will double check with lawyer in the morning.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:58:50
I've put a minimum reserve in which you can see on the raffle page:
But with the price of bitcoin keep changing I have lowered it twice since I started working on the site.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:06:09
if your selling I'm buying :)
Whatever exchange your using will allow you to transfer the USD/EUR or whatever into your bank account.
@_date: 2013-02-19 01:02:05
Love it. I'm tempted to advertise my condo I'm selling right now. Would definitely accept bitcoins instead of Canadian Dollars.
Good luck and she is a beauty.
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:09:31
Sorry for posting here but anyone in Toronto looking for BTC I am selling 10 this week if you want to save on the trade fee. Not having any luck on localbitcoins :(
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:32:36
+1 for Bitstamp. Interface is good and easy to use. Service is very fast, from deposits to withdrawals (usually next day).
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:50:36
sure it will :) I would advise holding so.
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:22:12
I'm a buyer right now and in Canada.

@_date: 2013-04-04 22:39:48
So I'm raffling my condo in Toronto, Canada. I was selling it anyway and the money was going to invested in bitcoins so might as well cut out the middle men. May go flat on my face but any questions please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer quickly.
EDIT: Just to update here, after getting legal advice I will be cancelling the raffle and instead replacing it with a skilled based contest with an entry fee.

I'm selling bitcoins right now via localbitcoins. I'm in Toronto but we can do a cash deposit to BMO and use escrow. Once I see it in my account I will release the funds. I've traded already and have some feedback on bitcointalk.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:08:25
Which wallet software are you using and where did you download it from?
To test if it's working ok you can send it a small amount of coin from your other wallet that has bitcoin in it, if you have one that is.
If you need some help I've no problem skyping with you for a few minutes sometime.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:48:46
Hi everyone, ok we are back on except this time it's a contest. The winning ticket needs to answer 2 questions if they are picked. It's also provably fair. I've reduced the duration and it's set to run from 9th April to 9th June. I've also added some runner-up prizes and an Early Bird Draw.
Finally I refunded the 3 people who bought tickets in the first few hours before I removed the raffle and I am given those 3 people the first 3 entry tickets to this new contest to be fair to them.
Oh and I've reduced the minimum reserve too with the increase in value of Bitcoin over the weekend.

I agree. The more and more people adopt the currency the higher it will go. It may go down because of nervous investors but I will buy as much as I can if it goes down.
The recent growth is because more people are aware of it and more are using it and once using it are realising what a good concept it actually is, nevermind the investment aspects of it. The ease of being able to send someone across the globe any amount of funds and be received within minutes or seconds and not be charged back for me is a game changer.
The biggest battle for the currency I see will be to get the older generation, and I'm not talking about those in their 60's, but even those in their late 20's and 30's to adopt to this new paradigm. Also, if a country were to set-up their own crypto-currency that appeals more to the general public it could have a huge affect.
@_date: 2013-06-07 01:29:59
Anyone else having issues since the upgrade? I'm having issues since I upgraded to 1.8. Electrum has become unresponsive, seems to keep syncing and during the sync becomes unresponsive.
Also to note, when I go to send, I can enter the address no problem but when I am entering the amount it again becomes unresponsive and takes several seconds for each digit to appear, sometimes can take up to 30 seconds.
I've tried re-installing and using different servers but neither has given me a fix. I'm using windows 7 64-bit, 12gb ram and ssd with plenty of disk space.

Although I'm sure MtGox's platform could be improved, you can still DDoS anything that is connected online. Doesn't matter if it is connected to their front end website. If the DDoS is bigger than the what can be accepted by the victims network then your screwed and have to wait it out. There are things you can do though to help/prevent as much downtime as possible.
With an exchange and live streaming data needed for users there will always be an end point or bottleneck. You just need to make sure your bottleneck is bigger than the attackers which can be very expensive and it's cheaper to create a DDoS attack than it is to defend against one.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:27:51
It's a bummer I know. But Quebec won't allow it I'm afraid.

A wallet is basically like your bitcoin bank account. You could have one installed on your desktop, one on your laptop and one on your phone. You could keep large deposits on the desktop for security and say $50 worth on the phone for small purchases on the move. Anyway, you can transfer them from account to account, or wallet to wallet. Either your own wallet  or someone else's wallet, just like a bank transfer except faster (minutes) and cheaper or free.
I think you will be fine then. Just don't panic sell. Paying with bitcoins right now can get you goods cheaper than with USD because of discounts some stores are offering, see 
Once you get a wallet (fee an online one here  and buy some bitcoins (just buy a couple or 1 to start) it will click and fall into place.
