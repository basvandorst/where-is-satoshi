One incentive is to drive the price down, if he's short the market. The sudden movement of Satoshi coins from one wallet to another would spook the market.  Or under duress, he could be forced to unleash those coins on the market and drive the price down under $100.  Currently, those coins are believed to be out of commission, locked up forever, or private keys lost.

i use breadwallet as a gateway to buy and sell bTC.  mostly around 10 btc max at a time but so far i've moved over $2 million dollars worth thru that wallet.  
i use it more as a hot wallet. i'd never store coins long term tho on a mobile platform, just doesn't feel safe. i have a hardware wallet for that.
one feature i wish breadwallet had was to delete the seed after backup like CoPay has.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:45:05

Moved a ton of BTC through iOS breadwallet but decided to get more serious about security. After experimenting with the Ledger Wallet Nano (not newest S), ordered 4 more of the cheapest barebone Ledger HW.1, which is tiny like a USB stick to carry in your wallet or hide somewhere.  Works with Mycelium when I'm on the road.  If it gets lost or someone steals it, it's useless without the 2FA card (or paired phone).   Plus, it's cheap like $16 USD or so.  I can also keep it plugged in at home, and remote into my box when I want to send BTC.  Then i just validate the transaction remotely.  PIN captured by keylogger is useless without the 2FA.
For Trezor, KeepKey or the new Ledger Nano S you can't validate remotely.  So if captured with your HW device it's possible to be coerced under duress to give up your bitcoins.  I keep my hardware wallet at home and my 2FA stays with me where I validate remotely.

Would love it, just to trick the general audience to be able to buy more at seemingly cheaper prices.  
But it's never going to happen.  Bitcoin was made to be divisible so that at a million dollars, a satoshi would be 1 cent.  Plus, the extra cost for exchanges to modify code and historical charts. They won't change anything unless absolutely necessary.  Also, all the tiny Alts have trading pairs with BTC, and those would get micro'd too which would confuse people even more.

So a 15 month delay?  Left BRD for Ledger because their main focus over that time period was promoting their BRD coin (even changed name from Breadwallet to a Ticker symbol) and adding s prior to implementing Segwit.
Note, I've moved over 2.6k bitcoins through Breadwallet since 2015 so it's been legit but I no longer trust guys that chose to chase last year's Altcoin bull run.    Their blog used to be awesome with anti-bank movements and the addressing the oppressed, but now it's all about promoting BRD payment gateways and crappy air drops.  BRD lost their way.

Correct.  The huge loss was a paper loss.

With gold, it's called "naked shorting" where you don't have to borrow existing gold in order to sell.  You can just keep shorting and shorting regardless of the existing supply.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand gold is shorted on paper 16x that of existing physical gold stores.

Either are fine.
What I hate are the constant firmware updates where you need to break out your seed and start all over again.  It's not like you can just store it in a lock box and fugetaboutit.  Actually, you can but after years of storage you'll need to update the firmware and/or software on your computer.  And that's where the hackers have proven successful in stealing funds.
My original Ledger Nano (prior to S &amp; X) is no longer even supported.
Lesson: The seed is the important thing to save.  Regardless of the software or hardware, the Bip39 seed is cross platform and future proof.
