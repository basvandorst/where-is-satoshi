Yeah, that's retarded. The multi-trillion dollar ForEx trading industry would like a word with you.

I guess I must have. Every hear of someone getting their coins back? I suppose I'll file a report regardless.
Goddamn I feel like an idiot.

More likely someone sold 3000 BTC without a price limit. They just kept selling to whatever buy orders happened to be on the market at whatever price was available.

If the tx-id system was reliable then it would make no difference. I'm guessing they just didn't realize that they were using a vulnerable system.

They aren't holding any bitcoins hostage. They *don't have any bitcoins left*. They were robbed, and are now insolvent.
Now we all agree MtGox shouldn't have been so vulnerable – it was an exploit they should have known about and avoided – but they aren't the only bad guys here. A criminal stole *a lot* of BTC.

That's a bit tin-foil-hatty. They fucked up, but I really doubt it was malicious. Just incompetent. Why would they do this on purpose? MtGox was a fucking goldmine for them.

So when I buy foreign currencies that's not investing? BTC, USD, EUR, it's all just currency.

Nix the sarcasm. This subreddit is better than that.

What is "lowly" about speculation? It's pretty weird to see you framing a financial position in moral terms!

Their press release read that way.

There is value in being able to send money anywhere in the world in just seconds. Time is money and all that.

Without their data it's hard to be sure, but the chart makes Google searches look like a leading indicator.

Why not? One simple potential mechanism: news cycle picks up some story about bitcoin, people get interested and buy some, price rises.
You don't *want* it to be true, but it could be.

Just anecdotes, sorry.

I think Cyprus showed us how valuable that was. People with access to BitCoin moved their liquid assets out while people without were left at the mercy of the ECB.
