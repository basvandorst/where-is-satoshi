I appreciate such a detailed and thoughtful reply. I have to apologize for my naivety - of course patience is the key to Bitcoin. I have a minor (big deal right)!in economics; however, with Bitcoin being so new I just don't have the foresight to appropriately guess when the price will rise or lower. So I guess I really need to continue my research before putting too much money in Bitcoin. The problem is I should invest asap if the price is going to keep rising and I don't have any guidance to help me make that decision as I don't think I can gain the skill of prediction in time. 
My problem with Coinbase is that my bank keeps denying my requests to buy Bitcoin. I called them and they said they would "look into it and do what they can" but it's been months and they still haven't authorized it. (BTC was in the $800s at that point and I knew it would go up). I have been buying alt coin and trading it and made about 0.1 Bitcoin over the corse of a month so maybe I will continue trying to play with that and maybe sell it now since we are in the thousands and pray for the price to plummet soon. 
Again, my apologies for being impatient as I know prediction and patience is key to BTC, I am just anxious about this skyrocket in price and I have finally saved up a respectable budget that I had wanted to dedicate to crypto 
So, long winded, but I guess I was really looking for a bit of advice whether that would be granted to me strait or telling me to read more and figure it out on my own.
I appreciate your time
