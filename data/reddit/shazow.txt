It's fun to consider a scenario where the only way banks could reduce fees enough to compete with Bitcoin was to use Bitcoin for international and high-risk transfers themselves.

If we like this idea, it doesn't necessarily need to be tied to Coinbase or MIT.
We could build a self-sufficient donation-driven Bitcoin faucet which lets .edu addresses join the queue and get $10 (or $100, what have you) worth of BTC once there are enough donations in the faucet.
Unfortunately this is not a super scaleable idea (I'm sure this offer will be more "limited time" than not). With several million college students in the US alone, that's many tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin donations which would need to drive this if it gains substantial adoption. Then again, that might be one of those "good problem to have" problems.

I disagree. Here are a few thoughts why:
1. I believe that this decimal-phobia thing is largely a US-centric thing. I find that the rest of the world, namely countries using the metric system, are less bothered by decimals. That said, I'm not convinced that changing the primary denomination of BTC every couple of years is going to have a net-positive effect.
2. BTC may be better positioned if people think of it more as a commodity/asset than dollars. Gold and many stocks go for over $1,000 per unit—this is a valuable (and more accurate) association for the General Public to make.
3. A more likely immediate effect would likely be "wait, I thought Bitcoins were worth $1,000 and it crashed to $1 already?!?"
I would suggest retaining BTC as the primary denomination and using Satoshis as the secondary denomination.
Until Bitcoin becomes a household technology, education is a necessary part of adoption. Understanding its divisibility is part of this.

I feel like 2 tits should be ``80085`` bits (or maybe ``58008`` if you're retro).

Let's imagine one of these countries adopted Bitcoin as a national currency.
Everything is rolling along dandily as the citizens convert their fiat into Bitcoins. Then, one rainy night a few months later, a critical flaw is discovered in Bitcoin. Maybe somebody can double spend, or force forks, or inject arbitrary amounts into wallets by spamming the network of miners in a specific way. Maybe somebody simply found a way to reverse a Sha256 hash.
Bitcoin might quickly collapse as users flock to an unaffected altcoin, but countries can't act this quickly. The nation's economy might collapse entirely, everyone's balances completely wiped by the time they can react.
This is unlikely to happen, of course. But it's also unlikely that a country will make such a drastic move as to adopt a risky new technology that could ruin its entire population. Perhaps someday, though.
These things take time.

Heh heh.
On a less funny note, [ß]( (S in German) would be a reasonable symbol for satoshis. It even kind-of looks like a B for Bitcoin, but has an S-sound.

There has been a good amount of publicity the last few days. [Gavin did a podcast on Econtalk]( there were [a handful of big Hackernews threads on Bitcoin]( there was a [Times article about Bitcoin]( there's increased activity on Twitter about Bitcoin (I'm building a service that monitors these kinds of things, not released yet).
Increased attention means increase in people looking into it and looking to buy coins, which drives up the rates faster than normal.
Also there was that guy claiming to be a VC wanting to [buy $200k worth of coins for $2 each]( The theory is that he was actually trying to cause panic buying in order to drive up the prices so he could unload some coins. Nothing definitive though.

For today I would choose (A) Money, only because I can go out and spend it right now without further effort of conversion.
But to hold $2,000 in a vault for 10 years, it will almost certainly depreciate in value. The other two options have probably equal probability of depreciating (if our culture stops caring about Bitcoins and Magic cards) or hugely increase in value.
Right now, say there's 15,000 bitcoin owners. If this number keeps growing, the value of bitcoins will increase. The question is, is it likely there will be at least 15,000 people holding on to bitcoins in 10 years? I believe so.
The current exchange value of bitcoins may be inflated due to the perceived "velocity" of bitcoin adoption, but I expect even with no growth velocity the bitcoins will have some reasonable base value as long as there are functional services that utilize them.

If you're in Toronto, I'm happy to trade in-person for cash (will be in town in 3 weeks, assuming Bitcoin is still around by then :P).

I agree that Bitcoin is overvalued and it's questionable whether its real value will catch up with its perceived value before the difference "bursts". On the other hand, I think the value of the Bitcoin economy is rapidly growing and the main reason is **low hanging fruit**.
When I discovered Bitcoin a bit over a month ago (the exchange rate was approximately $0.74), I wanted to acquire bitcoins because I was fascinated with the technology but I didn't want to set up Dwala account or wire money. Instead, I decided I'll *earn* bitcoins. I started a thread on the forums and offered a service in exchange for bitcoins—drawing stickfigures. Few weeks and dozens of commissions later, I earned more than 100 BTC. Now there are numerous other artists trying the same thing with varying degrees of success (I got lucky because I was there early).
I tried this several times before in the "real world", where I'd start a webcomic or a blog or try to sell posters—all failures. So what's different about Bitcoin? The community. At this moment, the Bitcoin community is full of consumers who are dying to justify their speculative investment. Every day, new Bitcoin-oriented services are springing up and reaching much more success than they ever would in the over-saturated real-world market because they have a captive audience with itchy wallet fingers. Poker tables, stock exchanges, lotteries, ponzi schemes, drug dealers, coffee bean sellers, alpaca sock vendors, Reddit-clones, kickstarters, Groupon-alikes, artists, game developers—all these things that exist by the thousands in Silicon Valley alone, but are still a rare breed in the Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin is not a disjoint currency, it's a disjoint *economy*.
I don't know how long this will last, but right now the Bitcoin economy is the American Dream incarnate.

It's possible that some aspect of your father's account triggered a regulatory flag and now his account needs to be reviewed manually. Many such scenarios prevent the company from disclosing to the customer that their account has been flagged, so often times you'll experience "buggy behaviour" where in reality it's just them stalling until the account is manually approved or passed on to the government for further investigation.
You can reach out to the company's support and see if it's an actual bug in their process, but if they're playing dumb/stalling, you know what you have to look forward to. :)

Thanks! Can you tell me more about what you had in mind for the contest winner? I could add some background, or are you generally opposed to the pixel art style? I'll try to mess around with it tonight before I go offline for the remainder of the year, though the atmosphere of the wizard as it is has been growing on me a lot. :)

For what it's worth, Linus is using a Chromebook Pixel these days, with some Linux distro on it.
