I divested from Bitcoin partly to diversify my finances.  For a few years, 99% of my net worth was in Bitcoin (because of its rapid appreciation). I decided that was unwise. I brought that down to about 3% over the course of a few years by selling Bitcoin each time its contribution to my net worth exceeded my target percentage for that month.
Anyway, by that time I realized that traditional financial networks had become such a choke point for getting into and out of the Bitcoin ecosystem that it had lost many of its original benefits for privacy and freedom.  I still have high hopes for cryptocurrencies improving personal liberty, but have lost some interest now that they're so mainstream.

I don't remember the exact duration, but that's about right. I did get my funds back in the end. The [shutdown announcement you mentioned]( is the best source of further details.

I'm optimistic.  In the 1990s, many thought that governments would permanently hobble encryption with backdoors.  We won the crypto wars.  I think we'll win the cryptocurrency wars too.

answered accurately about volumes.  I also exempted a few well-known customers from those limits and sold them around 200 BTC per week for a couple months.
As far as the source of the bitcoin, they nearly all came from other Bitcoin exchanges.  The main problem at the time was that those exchanges required wire transfers to deposit funds.  Wire transfer fees preclude small purchases.  So, effectively, I bought wholesale on the exchanges and sold retail through CoinPal.  Once [CoinCard]( was operating at reasonable volumes, some of those sales covered some demand for CoinPal sales.  That was one reason that I started CoinCard.

I owned Bitcoin until a couple years ago. As far as my personal finances: let's just say that I have sufficient for my needs.  As I've [mentioned elsewhere]( my main interest was in Bitcoin's impact on personal liberty.  On the financial side, I'm frugal by nature so a little bit(coin) goes a long way.

That's me. If anyone has questions, I'm glad to answer.

Living the dream: Raising five kids, enjoying time with my wife, writing a bunch of code, reading, etc.  As far work goes, I was running [my other business]( at the same time that I created CoinPal.  I recently sold that business to my cofounder, so I've been working on a variety of new startup ideas.  I've done a bunch of prototypes, but haven't yet found anything that I love.

Gladly.  Talking to Bitcoin enthusiasts during verifications was a fun part of the process.  Don't worry about any awkward silence; phone calls aren't my forte either :-)

I'm all for cryptocurrency experimentation.  I'm also not convinced that increasing the block size matters enough to be worth it.  Markets are good at allocating scarce resources, including scarce space in blocks.  I mentioned this [elsewhere in the thread]( but I think Bitcoin is best suited as a settlement layer for other cryptocurrencies. In that use case, block sizes don't matter as much.

Nope. I bought a bunch more BTC over the years, but sold my last coin a couple years back.

Not much use for one here in Wyoming.  No worries, the deep water kind of [freaks me out](
