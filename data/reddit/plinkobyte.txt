Hi. I'm a lead journalist at The Verge. Could you tell me what shirt you were wearing when you sold? PM me with a photo please. Thanks in advance.

Hey now.

You should write a dramatic short story about that. Would read +++

Nice app! Clean and useful. A couple suggestions:
- would be great to be able to filter Coins by market cap.
- in Coins view the cents should be formatted to 100th. Right now if a coin is $555.60 it is displayed as $555.6
- I saw a bug where "USD" gets put before volume in Coins view. Seemed to happen when I switched apps then went back to it. 
- Dark mode colors also got wacky when I switched apps. White text became gray. 
Good work! I'm on a Nexus 5x by the way.

He does have a way about him. I think it's because he speaks without notes, on the fly, which is kind of endearing. Sometimes he shows up to a speech without knowing what he's going to talk about.

There are fees associated with that, I assume, since your sending bitcoins to another Bitcoin address?

People want to get in before the hard fork. If you have Bitcoin, and you own your private keys, you get the same amount of coin in the new fork.

I'm sure you have permission from the copyright holder to use Bender and the Futurama IP, right?
Didn't think so.

I think you've posted here before. You seem to be looking for justification for your business idea. The only real justification would be to do it and see if it works instead of looking for approval from a random subreddit.

Not really.  It's the price where a stock, or in this case Bitcoin, has trouble falling below.

The same way you would send coins to anyone. Your wallet will have an address that you simply send to from Coinbase. I just bought a TREZOR and it was super simple to send coins to it from Coinbase. Highly recommended.

I believe that whenever a Bitcoin transaction is sent to the network the leftover change is sent back to your wallet to a new address. This transaction looks like it combined all of that change and used it as input.

Um, he created a "company" by spending $100k then sold the company for $60k in BTC.
