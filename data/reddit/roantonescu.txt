Which is a plus. But doubled blocksize means doubled blocksize even with compact blocks.
And somebody pointed out to me, that compact blocks does not work with Segregated Witness?

This is right. But the bonus is not a bonus for real I think.

That is great. Thank you! So this was a false information also...

I use my home connection for other stuff besides Bitcoin and I'd like to keep doing that. I don't want to set up a dedicated Bitcoin node with a dedicated connection. Imho that's exactly what Bitcoin shouldn't become. 
Torrent networks work very good with people giving up a limited share of their bandwidth.
Also admitted before, that 1 MB is already too much. And I think he is right and I don't know who is pressuring him and the other core devs into increase. 
See. If I could run my node and participate with an alternating bandwidth use that would be fine. But Bitcoin will not work that way. With Lightning coming, every block will be full (with 1 MB or 2 MB does not matter) and I and you will always have to transfer all the data every ten minutes. Or I am not a full node anymore. 
I am a bit afraid. I hesitated before writing but I think we now have a problem with people forcing situations into Bitcoin.
Bitcoin works very good. Why make it bad?

Yes, this is right. 
It fixes old problems and that is great. And it will help Lightning and so forth.
