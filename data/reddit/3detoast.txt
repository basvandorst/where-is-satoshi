Generally I would agree, but everything this kid posts is an insult or telling someone to fuck off. I wouldn’t exactly call that a skeleton in the closet. Maybe one day he will grow up, but only time will tell. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:48:15
Can’t tell if sarcasm or serious...
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:56:41
Ok bud. I recommend you look into finding a hobby instead of getting all worked up over what other people spend their money on. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:40:39
You must be so smart. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:17:07
That’s because iPhones hold their resale value much longer than Samsung’s.

Off contract smart phones used to be in the $400-500 range. Then they started costing around $700 off contract. Now we are pushing over $1,000. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:00:43
Lmao I had a feeling you were 12 years old, thanks for confirming it. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:49:28
Now it looks like I struck a nerve lol 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:52:23
So now you’re upset because of the phone I use? You are a sad person. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:05:49
Great analogy. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:44:43
A quick glance at your history shows how miserable of a person you are. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:39:39
You’re also comparing phones released more than a decade apart. Of course the Xs is going to be way more advanced. 
I’m not arguing about the demand for phones because clearly people are willing to pay the higher price.
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:44:00
There is no argument to attack other than “dur hur Apple fanboy”.

Just order a large, Farva.

On android I would recommend samourai wallet instead of electrum. You don’t need to import any private keys, just create a new wallet.

I didn’t mean I was fine with an SS symbol. I meant that it still didn’t look like it. Looks like lightning to me. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:19:22
About as difficult as it was writing @ for the first time. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 01:01:01
Exactly why you shouldn’t use them. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:29:29
Aren’t you worried about it breaking due to print orientation? Face down creates a weak point in the corner edge. Printing on its side results in a much stronger print.

I’m not familiar with Casa, but if it’s ready to use out of the box, then that’s where the price comes from. Same with prebuilt PCs. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:07:45
Still looks fine to me.
@_date: 2019-03-03 01:32:58
Only problem is most people don’t want it. I’ve been dying to use bitcoin as a currency, but any time I offer to pay someone in crypto or cash, they always choose cash. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 01:03:52
Wouldn’t that only be for lightning nodes? I ran a full node for about a year and never earned anything. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:18:12
It’s not about paying respect to anything. It’s about being recognizable as a symbol for money. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 01:53:21
Even if he isn’t THE satoshi, he laid the groundwork for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 00:18:38
This is gentlemen!
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:42:33
I have no idea who he is other than he wrote that article.
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:30:42
But he smoked a blunt! /s
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:28:25
He doesn’t even imply the creator of bitcoin deserves it. He’s saying anyone who held from early holdings. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:35:27
If op is smart then it should be vector based and be infinitely scalable. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:36:32
Its false. Lightning may be off chain, but you are still signing transactions with a private key. Your btc can’t be stolen by one of these “hubs”. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:52:25
We don’t need to show it support. They are already showing that they are desperate enough to get in on the blockchain craze. Classic FOMO. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:57:44
Are these wallets available to download?
@_date: 2019-02-02 23:12:29
Also allowing the cash app to act like a full bitcoin wallet instead of just buying/selling. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:27:22
What have you invented?
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:14:58
Just in case he comes back from the dead twice. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:58:32
Many people will use it just because it comes pre installed. So I’m sure we’ll see pretty soon how secure it is. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:10:01
Remind me to repost this in a week and photoshop my own address in. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:00:24
It needs to be known, for anyone new to bitcoin, that this guy is a fraud. He has control of too many social media accounts/websites  that people would rightfully assume to be official accounts. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:03:28
My brain hurts from reading those comments. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:19:35
The people who used bitcoin before the “bubble” are still using it. The people who hopped aboard to get rich aren’t using it, but they had no intentions of using it in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 01:00:38
The fomoer becomes the hodler. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:48:53
The difference is trusting the company you are buying a product from vs some faceless nobody on the internet. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:21:30
Technically you can, but good luck buying a single satoshi anywhere. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 17:11:23


@_date: 2019-01-16 13:45:14
You’re right. That is quite surprising. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:19:57
Plenty of admin level employees of Silk Road have already served their time and been released. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:39:59
Maybe foolish would be the right word. This isn’t the same as flashing firmware on your smartphone. They are trusting strangers with their money. That goes against everything that bitcoin is about. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:41:19
I doubt they are using a middleman at all. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:55:26
So greedy miners are paying the price for installing random code on their machines?
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:52:49
It’s the real life Paddy’s dollars.
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:05:10
Anyone who is a long term hodler is up every year. It’s only the 2017fomo’ers who are in the red.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:44:14
How easy is selling for USD? Do you need to give any info to the buyer?
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:33:39
And in 2016 people said the same thing about 2013. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:53:49
I’d rather support a company that is actively supporting bitcoin. Let me know when you guys accept bitcoin and I’ll reconsider. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:44:57
I’m really disappointed that you guys have this stance. 
All we can do is vote with our wallets and not support companies that use bitpay. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:11:31
It doesn’t melt plastic. And eating plastic is generally fine. Not suggested, but you don’t digest it. It just passes through. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:25:57
It’s really disappointing to see how immature the ledger dev has been about this.
