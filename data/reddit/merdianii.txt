Second Password is the password you select when you send funds, you should enter then you can send it.
Unfortunately that password is not recovable.

There are some funds that's why I can't leave that.
Second Password I mean, the Password that it asks you to type before sending funds to others.
I enabled that and all of passwords are saved, but only the Second Password is not saved :((

This sounds helpful, going to try as it says there too you don't need password to access only recovery phrase.
Will update again later. Thank you

I just tried.
Imported seed there, but the balance is 0.mBTC?
Did I do anything  wrong or it didn't worked?

About first one tried to import with private keys but it asked me to type Second Password.
About second I did this as you told on beginning, but there's a problem.
In this article 
It says "Please note that imported addresses are not backed up by the wallet recovery phrase. We strongly recommend you sweep funds from imported addresses."
So take a look here 
As you on that image I haven't made any import and it means that imported address cannot be backed up.
So I should have funds backed up by Bitcoin Wallet, but the strange problem is that when I did that funds were $0.00.

I was very near to recover funds, but I haven't imported Bitcoin Address for Private key.
And when I try to do that it shows me to put Second Password.
I recovered by Backup Phrase, but then it asked for Second Password to do that.
Any idea ?
