I remember reading an AMA about a guy living a month solely off bitcoins. 
He used 
(also from USA) there's a 1.99% Service Fee with $2.49 minimum; $75 maximum
They give $3 for free if someone referred you. I haven't made an account but if you want, I can make one and send it to you. Feel free to send me a PM, hope that helps!

I just made an account, excited to see how well it does! Just invested 3.38 BTC. 
I noticed a $20 referral credit, if you guys are interested, here is mine (but feel free to use your other fellow redditors!)
(I haven't finished the verification -- which is required to receive the referral credits.. but I wonder if I'm able to have them on hold till my verification clears? We'll see..)

fingers crossed! :)
yeah, since im no developer, I have no idea how easy/hard it would be. Assuming if both seeder and downloader are using the same clients, it could help? 
However, I thought if it did work out, future big name clients (utorrent, transmission, etc) could integrate the protocol into their client as well. But I'm probably getting ahead of myself there.

Here's how I see it.. Whoever created torrent.. their purpose was the increase the accessibility to share "files" right? (rather than increase piracy.. imo). The actual "files" however is totally up to the users to decide. This whole idea is just a protocol, what people do on it however is up to them.
The ethics of such a service is dependent on the seeder, not the protocol itself.
After all, not all torrents are copy-written material.. right? ;)
Creating bitcoin can be used for other things than selling drugs. I think the same idea would apply here. Of course some people will choose that route but I don't think the framework itself should be responsible. 
I think I'm beating a dead horse here.. but feel let me know what you think :)

I guess there definitely needs to be an option to select which files you choose to seed for free. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:27:18
which is perfectly fine! you prob just get lower priority if someone else is willing to fork up &gt;0.0001 btc. if nobody is raining pennies, you would get the same priority as anyone else :)  (well that was my idea anyway)

sweeet!! now I feel like a newb for doing a crap search job lol
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:03:17
Yeah, continuing from what you said: Older files would benefit from more seeders. Popular files wouldn't be affected much because of the high number of seeders (essentially driving competition up to basically free)

Thank you for your honest opinion!
I had no idea this idea has been floating around. (only did a quick google search)
Yeah I agree, finding that niche of files is definitely something to think about if this works. 
If something like this did exist, however, one thing is for certain. I'll never delete a file again! :D
