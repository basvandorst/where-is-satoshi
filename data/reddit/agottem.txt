Nice job moving that goal post.

Change takes time?  I myself only just started using segwit.  Fees are indeed less too!

You go to the atm and make a cash withdrawal and probably pay an atm fee to do so.  This is equivalent to opening a lightning channel on the blockchain.
You can then transact in cash all day long without fees.
At the end of the day, you return to the atm and deposit whatever cash you have left over.  This is equivalent to closing your lightning channel.
That’s lightning network.

Why do none of these people ever attack Bitcoin Cash on the centralization front?  Block size and centralization are directly related, yet no one puts much energy into calling Bcashers out on it.

Geez, you’re shilling everywhere.  Redditor for 1 whole week.
LN is in alpha.  It’s live right now.  You can use it.  There’s still bugs being fixed.

I guess you really can't fix stupid.

Obviously not true -- 1890 - 1910 was one of the greatest economic booms in american history and there was no inflation.


What planet are you living on?  Virtually everyone today must go out and beg for a job from the capitalist class.


Only if you assume no taxation.  Furthermore, inflation doesn't mean free money.  It's still true, even under an inflationary currency, that most capital producing assets are owned by the wealthy.  Any new money pumped into the economy is seen by them first.  By the time it works its way to the lower classes it's already lost its value.


Money with a fixed supply doesn't prevent circulation.  If there's investment that's worthwhile, people will always be willing to risk their money.  Furthermore, back when money was fixed to scarce resource, it was easier to make long term predictions about what the value of a dollar would be x years in the future.  This is why 100 year bonds were not uncommon back when the gold standard existed.


Hoarding can be discouraged through taxation.  This has the added benefit of being an open and honest policy.  Inflation is dishonest -- people don't see it happening.  Inflation enables politicians to not be honest about their spending (which facilitates endless wars).


That'd be a great fuck-you to the working class.  They wouldn't be able to save for retirement.


We have this today.  Instead of hoarding money, the wealthy escape inflation by hoarding real estate.  Not only does this subject the working class to the perils of inflation, it simultaneously means they can't afford shelter -- one of the most basic necessities.
You've made sweeping assumptions in your arguments for inflation.  Your primary argument seems to be "it prevents hoarding".  I believe that hoarding still exists with an inflationary currency, it's just that only the wealthy can afford the assets which enable them to escape inflation.  We see this in the widening inequality trend which has existed since abandoning the gold standard.  Hoarding is easily solved with taxation.  It's how we recovered from the great depression -- we taxed the wealthy and invented public works projects to put people back to work.  Inflation is a net negative for everyone but the 1%.

You're clearly quite dumb.  I can help explain though:  When hyperedge says "Look at the 60k average block size" he means BCash doesn't have enough transactions to fill up 1% of the bcash block capacity.  The number of transactions is less than 5% of the number Bitcoin has.  Saying "no one is using bcash" is approximately correct.

Sounds like you want to make an argument *for* inflation.  Please, proceed.  I'd love to be convinced.


The energy is used for securing the blockchain, not producing bitcoin.

I absolutely disagree.  In fact, mining is just now beginning to be used as subsidies for green energy.  Previously, a significant amount of wind energy and solar was wasted -- if there's no demand and no room to store it the only option is to burn it off as waste heat.  This was a huge inefficiency in green energy ventures.  These ventures are now beginning to use bitcoin mining as a subsidy -- instead of dumping the excess electricity, they mine bitcoin with it which is very profitable.
Furthermore, if bitcoin enables us to eliminate huge swaths of the banking industry the energy spent performing proof of work will be more efficient than the old system.

But where is the actual data stored?  Who's volunteering their harddisk to store these preferences?
I still don't understand where the proof of work comes in.  Why is this necessary to save my preferences?

Your website claims:


What does this mean?  Where are you storing the data such that it's considered "decentralized"?  Additionally, what does proof of work have anything to do with this?
