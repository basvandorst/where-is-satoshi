Lol no. Once people realize there is an entire world of cryptos that are much more useful than Bitcoin, it will plateau. Bitcoin has name recognition on its side and that's about it if we're being honest with ourselves here.

OP, can you explain this chart? I already know the answer but I'm pretty sure you have no clue what you're talking about. I'm sick of people in this subreddit making arguments for Bitcoin over Fiat that are fundamentally inaccurate.
Like, you do realize that Bitcoin doesn't have what it takes to replace Fiat, right? What Bitcoin doesn't have is exactly what's displayed in your chart. Nor does it have what it takes to be a reliable store of value due to the way it handles decentralization. Bitcoin needs some major work done on it.
Read a book or take a single class in economics and you wouldn't post things that make you look so stupid.

I've said it in this sub time and time again... Bitcoin will never be adopted unless we make applications for it that are stupid proof.

Not sure if sarcastic, but transactions are getting slower and fees are rising
@_date: 2019-08-07 00:36:49
You understand economics right? You're not going to have everyday transactions with a deflationary currency. We've had deflationary currencies before and they cause major problems and bring the economy to a halt.

His second mistake is the assumption that a logo with no name, text, or link to indicate more information is going to compel people to look for more information.
This idea wouldn't do anything for people who already know about Bitcoin. It is for the people that don't know about Bitcoin... But when you have no where to direct them, they won't go anywhere to learn more.
This idea would require the user to see the image, download the image, reverse image search it, then hope it takes them to a Bitcoin information page instead of just regurgitating more YouTube profiles with the same image. Not to mention that if you know how to reverse image search, you're probably more tech savvy than most and already know about Bitcoin. So...
Good luck!

How is it better?

Then run for office?
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:49:01
So you're saying that Bitcoin doesn't have product-market fit. I agree and this is actually a major problem that no one seems to be addressing. If we expect this to be adopted by the masses, we have to reach product market fit or else this just isn't a viable solution.
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:50:27
Yeah, well currencies without inflation don't do too well for serving as an actual currency. So, you shouldn't count on Bitcoin or anything with a fixed supply cap to serve as a currency.
The recent selling point has been to treat it as a store of value, but that could be problematic in the future when Miner's have no incentive to mine. Once block rewards are all distributed and miners are living off of transaction fees, there won't be enough to go around because typically stores of value, like gold, don't see very many transactions. So there won't be very many transaction fees for the miners. They'll stop mining Bitcoin which will lower the network hashrate and leave the blockchain vulnerable to attacks.
This is something that needs to be solved with Bitcoin. We've got time to solve it, but it's going to be a pretty big roadblock. Not sure if PoW is sustainable for a coin like this.
@_date: 2019-08-11 23:43:53


Probably not. Economies don't function with fixed supplies

Yes. Exactly. Which is why net neutrality is so important. It protects the consumers, not the companies.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:16:41
You're missing the point.
Do you believe that you should be able to access any legal website you want?
Do you believe that the internet companies should be able to block you from accessing whatever websites they decide?
If you think you should be able to access whatever site you want, then you're in favor of Net Neutrality. That's what it comes down to. It's a censorship issue. If Net Neutrality is revoked, then Comcast can say "Oh, you want to go to Fox News? Hmm... They're our competitor. DENIED! You have to use NBC because we own NBC."
Or have Verizon say "Hmm... You want to use Google? Well, that sucks cuz we own Yahoo and you have to use Yahoo search engine now."
Cuz this is very possible. They've already had lawsuits against them for this exact stuff. Net Neutrality isn't a proactive law, it's reactive because of the way the ISPs were behaving.

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:05:47


I've explained to you several times. The free market hasn't solved these issues. We've been stuck in a cycle of suing the ISPs for violating this shit. Did you not see the list of lawsuits I sent you?
We tried the free market. It didn't work. Now we're at plan B. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:43:10


Most people against these laws say that "there was never this problem before" or "Net Neutrality is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist", but that's wrong. Net Neutrality isn't a proactive regulation, it is reactive.
Here's a brief history of what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:
MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 
VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.
AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products. 
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

I think the bitcoin community would rather have freedom of internet and take the hit of government regulation in that case. Not having the freedom of internet is much more detrimental to government intervention because the cost of the government not intervening is much heavier than not at all... especially after seeing the Telecom and FCC's plan on what they'll do if that is the case.
If we didn't know what they were going to do, then yeah, they'd support abandoning Net Neutrality. But since we know what will happen... Well that changes everything.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:26:45


You're not the first to suggest this. The reason why this hasn't happened is because the monopolies are literally written into the local laws. Early on the telecom companies made deals with cities to be the provider, barring anyone else from entering.
If you look at the Google Fiber project, they're trying their best to fix the situation, but it's not working. Google has more money and more resources than anyone else possibly could get together, and they're even having an unbelieveably tough time getting it done. If Google can't do it, then no way in hell can anyone else!
So, what do we do? The only place to turn is for government intervention. Net Neutrality is more like a plea bargain. We're saying, "Fine, you get to keep your monopoly and we're not going to break you up for Anti-Trust. What we will do though is make sure that your platform is fair. So, you will not favor any website over another. You will make sure that the internet is a completely level playing field and that everyone has access to anything they want without you telling them they can't, with the exception of websites that promote illegal activities."
And that's what Net Neutrality does. Yes, it's a government regulation, but no matter how you cut it, it's good for both sides of the bargain. It's just that the ISPs now are saying "Holy shit, if we sell these websites in packages like we do with TV packages, we can make a whole lot more money! But the only thing that stands in our way is Net Neutrality".
So that's why it was put into place, and that's why the internet companies want it to be revoked. I think it's a fair plea bargain. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:06:33


You're right, but when it comes to the ISP in the US, there is no free market. I understand the free market part of things. I love having a free market, but the internet isn't in the domain of the free market. It's an oligopoly.
The government isn't telling them to break up cuz they're too huge. They're telling them that they need to treat all internet traffic the same. They're not allowed to favor one site over another. They're not allowed to control what you're doing on the internet. It's the 1st Amendment being expanded to the internet.
Read about it! I'm sure you'll be a fan! I didn't like it at first cuz I'm like you and think the free market should rule, but then I actually read about the lawsuits against the shady practices by the ISPs and read about how Net Neutrality relates to it. Net Neutrality is a no brainer, especially if you're a 1st Amendment loving American.
I'm not a fan of the idea that the Internet Companies can control what I see and what website I go to. Net Neutrality protects against that, so that's why I'm a fan of it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:13:14
Nothing. And they didn't treat them all as equal
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:05:37
My answer is that I don't think we should call in the feds for anything, but they've literally told us their plan if they roll back net neutrality and I don't want that. So I welcome the feds in this case.
I think it's shitty that they tried blocking competing services. They don't own the internet. No one does. So why are they trying to control it so much? Fuck that. I work for an internet company. I'd be out of a job if they decided they didn't want to allow access to my company's website. There are much better ways they can make money instead of censorship. It's unamerican what they're doing in my opinion. It's a violation of my 1st amendment rights. So I could care less what happens to the big telecoms.
I don't want my internet to become like the TV packages where I have to buy 20 different channels to get the one I actually want.

Alright, You sent me to this comment via: 
And I can see your point, but it is fundamentally wrong.
Net Neutrality wasn't a proactive move. It was a reactive move. You say you're a fan of bitcoin because of it's decentralization. That's good because that means you're on the side of Net Neutrality. Here's why:
Our internet is currently under Net Neutrality laws. Net Neutrality is what forces Internet Companies to "treat all internet traffic as equal". That means that Comcast, who owns NBC, can't make your connection to Fox News (their competitor) slower. They can't give you a better connection to their own services.
[Business Insider]( also explains it very well and puts it simply like this:


Now, to the argument that "they see a fake problem and want a fast, not thought thru, solution". Net Neutrality doesn't solve a "fake" problem. The problem is real and it's actually what triggered Net Neutrality laws to be implemented in the first place.
Here's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:
MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage.

You're assuming that everyone has the ability to choose between most ISPs. I'm glad you live in a market where that's possible, but there are several huge markets where that's not the case. New York mostly only has Comcast, Arizona mostly only has Cox.
Take a look at this tool and set it to One Provider so you can see who has the freedom of choice. You'll find that MOST of the United States doesn't get to chose their internet provider: 
Not sure why you're bringing up the ACA. It's irrelevant. I honestly hate most government regulation (I'm a republican), but Net Neutrality is the one issue where I think it needs to be implemented and Title II needs to take place. The internet is tightly intertwined into the way we live now that everyone should have unrestricted access to it. It's mankind's greatest invention in my opinion and I'm not going to let the ISPs ruin it.


Refer back to the map tool. There is no free market. Internet is a natural monopoly because it so damn expensive to start up. You need billions of dollars. It's like trying to replace all of the roads in the United States.
Net Neutrality isn't a proactive move. It's reactive due to the way the Internet Providers were behaving.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:51:50
I'm struggling to find out what you have against Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality is an extension of the 1st amendment to cover the internet too. America prides itself on the 1st Amendment. So, I'm very confused on why people are so against it.
Net Neutrality isn't telling the ISPs how to operate or how to do business. It's simply telling them that they aren't allowed to control what we browse. It prevents the ISPs from forcing you to view the content that the ISPs want you to view. It's anti-propaganda and pro freedom for the people.
Do you want Comcast telling you that you can't view Fox News? Or Verizon telling you that you have to use their Yahoo search engine instead of Google?
This is a very fundamental issue. I'm confused on the problem you have with it. Especially since you're a Bitcoin fan which supports the freedom of money, why wouldn't you support the freedom of the net?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:49:11


They can do that anyways with or without Net Neutrality. You're making the same logical fallacy of using a horrible ending to justify not doing anything at all. It's like the genetic engineering people saying that we're going to start playing god and have designer babies. Or the people saying that Artificial Intelligence will lead to killer robot overlords.
Yes, those are all possible, but that's not the argument right now. There's always a way to make things malicious, but that shouldn't be the reason for you to not do anything.
Your argument is with the NSA, not the FCC.
Edit: I could make the same logical fallacy with Bitcoin. Bitcoin will lead to drug dealers and criminals using it because no one can control it. Obviously, we know that this isn't necessarily the case, but my point is to please don't use this line of logic. It can easily backfire and is just a bad logical flow.

The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 
VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.
AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products. 
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.
If you believe that everyone should have access to the internet and believe that you should be able to go to whatever website you want (unless it's blatantly illegal like child porn) then you are in support of Net Neutrality with Title II. That's what it comes down to.

Me: Not necessarily (kinda proof)
You: None of that FUD will actually happen

What? Our internet is currently under Net Neutrality laws. It's not adding more regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:18:11


I'm all for that, but what happens when the market doesn't sort it out? What happens when our Internet starts looking like our TV services where you buy websites in packages... like Portugal's internet:
The market isn't sorting this out because there is no market to sort it out. It's become a monopoly. It's pretty clear. This happened THIS YEAR:

I don't have a problem with him releasing the DNC emails. That's fine in my book, but they also claimed to have damaging GOP files and prevented their release. That's not very transparent at all.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:00:32


It very much so is. Do you know how much money it costs to dig up streets, lay down cable, get the permits for all of this, set up the data centers, etc. to start an internet company? It's ridiculously high. High enough, in fact, that the laying down of cable for the internet had to be [subsidized by the government.](


I'm glad you mentioned it because the reason Net Neutrality was put together in the first place is because of exactly this reason! Take a look:
MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services.

That's not what I said at all. WikiLeaks doesn't release everything unredacted like they did in the beginning. They only release what they want, which means they control the narrative.
The examples I included we're times that they filtered what was released. In the US Election they decided NOT to release their GOP leaks but pushed forward DNC leaks. They tried to block the release of the Panama papers and came out strongly against them when they were released. 
The insurance files are blackmail so that he wouldn't be arrested. Why would he hold back information when he's supposed to be a proponent of transparency. Releasing the insurance files would be transparent, but he's holding it back as a weapon. That's not chill.

Which part are you saying "How" to?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:35:43
The US didn't deem itself the world police. Post world war 2 treaties, NATO, the Truman Doctrine did that.
Basically the US and Europe agreed that the US would uphold and advance its military as a protection against the spread of communism.
This goes back to 1947.

I just read nearly the whole thing. Didn't see where it explained how the United States became the world police.

But... it does behave like a stock... lol


Cuz we're not working with a single organization listed on one stock exchange that is accessible by one country. We're working with the GLOBAL economy now. More money means bigger dollar amount fluctuations. If you look at the percentage though, it's pretty closely aligned with how stocks behave.

Not sure how to reply to this since I was expecting you to show me where/why I am wrong, but this is just a matter of opinion on your end. I'd advise against calling people "brainwashed" when your side of the argument boils down to an opinion instead of historic data.
In an attempt to not stoop down to that level, here's a great place to start to learn about deflation, the times that it has occurred, and the effects it had on the various economies:
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:42:51
What's the difference between a concern troll and bringing up a valid flaw with the system?
Stop listening to the circlejerk and start asking questions. I've already asked the question for you... "What could possibly go wrong with applying a fixed supply cap to a currency?"
Now, go open your history book along with your economics book and read about what happens to countries with deflationary currencies.
Here, I did part of the research for you too: 
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:37:29
You're arguing something different than the topic at hand.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:26:23
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:53:11
You do understand that deflationary currencies are horribly unsustainable, right?
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:32:11
It could. Inflation happens when the purchasing power of money decreases and/or prices increase
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:36:14
Who controls the rate of inflation is a completely different argument.
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:46:23
I can guarantee you that Bitcoin won't replace currencies... At least not in the current state. Again it all goes back to risk. Cryptocurrencies are extremely extremely risky, and I'm not even talking about the price volatility. I'm talking about the functionality and the large amount of user input required to use them.
They put too much responsibility on the user which is highly subject to human error. We currently can't reverse any transactions or recover any funds. That's too much trust in the user and one of the major barriers preventing crypto from being widely adopted.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:59:44
Here's some of the dangers of deflation
And more reading for you: 
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:20:26
You're right, but I'd still consider it deflationary because this period of inflation is only temporary and was never intended to last forever.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:38:47
Aight. Take your time. I'll be here
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:58:39

No I think they might be smarter than the people here
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:27:42
Don't expect Bitcoin to replace banks... Banks offer the depositers many many many benefits that Bitcoin does not. Banks essentially eliminate the risk of accumulating currency. Accumulating Bitcoin is extremely risky. Too much can go wrong with holding Bitcoin.
Until holding Bitcoin and other alts becomes "stupid proof", Banks are here to stay.

Send over the literature. I'll give it a read, but I'm not doing your research for you.
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:52:34
It's still fundamentally unsustainable. People don't spend currencies that increase in value. They hold onto it which makes the economy grind to a halt when there isn't any money moving around.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:25:28
Hahaha thank you for the laughs. It's not me that's disagreeing with you, it's history.
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:38:40
That doesn't mean it isn't deflationary. That's actually one of the counters against the negative effects of being deflationary, but it is still deflationary.
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:54:20
Which is the major major major flaw for deflationary currencies. You know that right?
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:28:06
How would it instantly hyperinflate?
If it inflates 3% in a year and the excess goes to everyone... The inflation is still only 3%? I'm not following what you're saying.
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:43:41
When you have a deflationary currency, that means that the supply of dollars or Bitcoin or whatever is steadily decreasing. Bitcoins deflation comes from lost coins, wallets, etc. that become unaccessible in the network. When the supply is decreasing, the asset becomes rarer and rarer. When things become rare, the value of them goes up (usually).
When the value of money goes up, people tend to not spend it. Why? Because their money is getting more and more valuable for doing absolutely nothing with it and just keeping it in your account. You're not earning interest, you're not investing it, the money isn't moving around but it is still increasing in value. Sounds great for the holder, right? That's because it is great for that individual, but it is devastating for the economy.
It is devastating for the economy because when people aren't spending their money and money isn't moving around, the economy slows down and we enter a recession period. Traditionally, to combat this governments print money to increase the supply cap and decrease the value of their currency, known as inflation. They do this at a (usually) steady and controlled rate so that the currency slowly loses value. So what does that mean for the consumer?
Well, if your money is constantly losing value then it isn't worth it to just keep it in a bank account because it will just deteriorate and lose value until it becomes worthless. That's not good. So to prevent that from happening you put your money into investments which is essentially you saying to the investment "Hey, my money is no good just standing here. How bout you take it and use it for what you need, but I expect you to pay me back in full plus interest/dividends/etc." So whoever you invested in takes that money, puts it into Research and Development of a new product, they sell that product, and pay you back plus some using the profits they made.
Now you have more wealth to spend, invest, or whatever while the economy keeps pushing forward.
This is the simple explanation since I'm not sure how knowledgeable you are about economics and monetary policy. I can go deeper if you want, but this is the jist of it. Also, I did this on mobile so if something doesn't make sense, just let me know and I'll fix it.
Edit: Here's the wikipedia page that lays out the times that we've experienced deflation and what happened: 
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:23:10
It absolutely is deflationary. You know what deflationary means, right?
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:38:07
Not sure what that's a graph of. Context?

Not when you have a fixed supply cap

They're not stupid. They just don't have a use for it... Which is true for nearly everyone whether you own some or not.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:38:51
Shh... I'm working on that right now. I expressed my concerns above and I've been working on a solution to them for a while. It's just tough cuz you need it to be secure but also completely in the hands of the user. Well actually that's the easy part. 
The difficult part is being able to incentive people to use it, like how normal savings have interest rates. The coins with masternodes already have this built in... Sorta. But the coins that are strictly PoW are the ones that are tough to do in this fashion.
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:25:48


Unfortunately, this is exactly why we'll never see mass adoption. People are stupid and we need to make this stupid proof for it to be mass adopted.

They've officially announced it...
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:54:47
This is exactly why I don't think Bitcoin will ever be mass adopted. It's too risky for the everyday person. There's so much responsibility that goes into holding crypto. For things to be mass adopted, you need to make it stupid proof and crypto just doesn't have that.
While Banks participate in shitty practices, they make keeping money stupid proof and insurable. Until we have the safeguards in crypto that we do with Banks, we will be forever waiting for mass adoption.
