Everyone who had a anonymous wallet with blockchain.info (created with tor) is SOL. You have to go to cleannet to collect your bitcoin. I've noticed this about a month ago, i'm surprised it wasn't just me.

meet someone locally near you on LocalBitcoins, you will need to be verified anywhere else that is not a scam.

Sure whats a good deposit address where we can all send you money

When I registered today, looking over the verification questions for identity and your bank.. It didn't look like there was any reason to state "less privacy" Its the same generic questions most people have to fill out when they registered with someone like cryptsy.. or OKCOIN / BITFINEX or really anywhere that deals with USD.

Their services do not work with TOR anymore.

of course, however I found it interesting having never seen a negative balance be confirmed for so long.
