I'd like to jump in on this example. Let's say there's a third person on the island, John, with $100 and he plans to buy apples. $100 can buy 100 apples. But wait- the central bank prints money, therefore reducing the value of John's $100. Now he can only buy 90 apples, with his $100, which means that less apples have been produced for the island.

Of course. Slavery was completely institutionalized with laws enforcing it.  If slavery existed in a society without a State, there are many possible solutions. I'll suggest some I've heard.
1. Buy the slaves and free them.
2. Offer to shelter runaway slaves and help them out
3. Discriminate against all slave advocates in your personal life and business
4. Fund an army to go around freeing slaves
5. Educate people as to why slavery is wrong
Apparently there's 30 million slaves that exist in the world today, so the State isn't doing a great job at eliminating this practice.

You asked a yes or no question and so far you've gotten no answer direct answer. OP isn't asking what the advantages of using BTC for merchant transactions are. He wants to know if it lowers the spot price. The answer is yes, it reduces value, the same as if a person had sold their Bitcoins directly. 
A lot of people do buy extra Bitcoins for the purpose of spending, in addition to the ones they have in cold storage. If a person buys extra Bitcoin for the purpose of spending then the price will balance out to the same as if he/she hadn't bought them once they're spent.

# Miners will be able to signal that they are willing and able to enforce segwit starting at the beginning of the first 2,016-block retarget period on or after 15 November 2016 (UTC).
# If 95% of blocks within any retarget period signal support for segwit, it locks-in.
# After another 2,016-block (roughly two week) retarget period, segwit will activate, allowing miners to produce blocks containing segwit transactions on Bitcoin’s mainnet.
# If segwit has not activated by the end of one retarget period after 15 November 2017, segwit will cease to be eligible for activation.

Segwit is never going to activate because it requires 95% of mining power to be on board with it. That's not going to happen, especially with anti-Segwit vocalist Roger Ver who's starting his own mining pool. The dude has a ton of money and can help make an impact the way he chooses.

Isn't Bitcoin technically something in between deflationary and inflationary? There's going to be EXACTLY 21 million. The only reason it's "deflationary" is because we know that Bitcoins will occasionally be lost and become out of use. If billionaires were to burn their cash instead of reinvesting or making purchases at a rate faster than the government prints money then fiat currency, by this definition, would also be deflationary.

They could of done a better job of teaching about the currency rather than focus on the negatives which can be easily mitigated. I'll break down what is off:
"Never have in your wallet because it's a virtual currency."
There are teams working on debit Bitcoin cards, and also there's currently coins you can buy with a Bitcoin private key imprinted on each one. He also could have mentioned that you can store Bitcoins in your brain by remembering a phrase of your choosing.
The economist says it "resembles" a currency and the reasons he lists for it not being one are as follows: 
-It fluctuates in value
-It's designed to be deflationary
He says that people are flooding to it because they think it's the next big thing and this will undermine it. Why do you believe in this assumption? How do you know the true price of a bitcoin isn't exactly what it's trading for?
He talks about how laundering is a security threat. Why is money laundering a security threat and in what way exactly? Please provide real world specific examples. 
"People can use it to move money around countries" &lt;- he says this like it's a bad thing, because everyone loves paying conversion fees and being inconvenienced. 
At 8:25 he starts talking about how Bitcoin has the same problems as if you were to use gold as a currency. He tries to explain why he thinks this but he only comes back to Bitcoin being deflationary. 
He talks about Zimbabwe linking their currency to one people already have faith in. I think the Zimbabwe people have given up on their hyper-inflated Zimbabwe dollar and have resorted to using USD. 
The only negative point this economist can give is that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. We could have used his entire speaking time to learn about the mystery behind Satoshi Nakamoto, about mining technology, or to learn more about how Bitcoin operates and how you can buy it. Instead we waste this time on a Keynesian who can't comprehend how a society can operate without the ability to pump money into an economy.

Right one purpose of this post is to make people aware that purchasing power and inflation/deflation are separate things. It's possible to have a deflationary currency that loses purchasing power, and it's possible to have an inflationary currency where its purchasing power increases.

Most people's idea of economics is entirely incorrect, so Bitcoin succeeding would directly blow some fallacies away. I recommend reading up on Austrian economics.  "Value is subjective (personal).

Bitcoin almost certainly has a positive return expectation. Keep in mind there's also a large risk in holding dollars, because of the possibly of hyperinflation. And in any other investment there's obviously risk. If you decide to buy BTC make sure it's for the long term.

I was answering OPs question "Why does only post negative articles about Bitcoin?" My answer is because they approach Bitcoin and economics from a Keynseian point of view.
Keynseians can't accept Bitcoin because it contradicts their principles. Such as thinking no one will spend Bitcoins because they'll increase in value, and that's why it'll never work as a currency. I don't know why you're saying I admitted to having no real knowledge of economics. All I said was I never took any economics classes, isn't it possible to learn outside this arena?

I like how Bitcoin proves to people that the free market is perfectly capable of creating and providing currency. Before now, people would never accept such a thing. One by one we will demonstrate that the State is not necessary and it will become obsolete.

US government decreed alcohol illegal and then the next year gold, so I would argue they can do whatever they want.

The holders increase the value of bitcoins benefiting the people who spend them. The higher the market cap the more money out there to purchase goods and services. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:22:27

What makes you use the word artificial? Isn't it perfectly natural to want to hold on to an asset that will increase in value? Once it reaches a desired value the owner will opt to spend/sell. 
It's always good to examine the opposite of any situation. With an inflationary currency what's the point of saving? Isn't there a built in artificial incentive to spend, instead of save, which will result in bubbles?
Saving is a good thing for the economy, you've been mislead by economists and government to think otherwise. It's one of the greatest manipulations of mankind to fool the population into thinking we need a currency which constantly expands.

"Federal Reserve, et al spend a few hundred $billion to quietly purchase nearly all ฿, and then throw them away."
I see absolutely no possibility of the man in charge of throwing bitcoins away accidentally owning the "garbage bin" private key.

I prefer the strategy of flying under the radar until Bitcoins become too large for the government to squelcher. Mainstream media exposure has the very real risk of them doing endless scare mongering about this new and unfamiliar currency. Besides, don't you want to keep the price low for now to continue buying up?

Try to add an emotional news story since this sounds like it'll be on a more mainstream outlet. Find out at least one happy tear-jerker story about bitcoin, this is what will give you the great sound bites and it makes something unfamiliar easier to relate to. There's certainly going to be a lot of news stories attacking bitcoins.
