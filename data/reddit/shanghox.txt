Weren't you the guy giving away a bunch of free Bitcoin?

Don't you have a few thousand BTC though?

"OUT OF THIN AIR" That's not exactly how QE behaves. I nominate this for r/badeconomics.

I agree. I'm just saying the personal decision to spend or hold is the same whether you hold USD (that you could immediately convert into BTC) or BTC itself.
So the "issue" that Bitcoin is deflationary is a non-issue.

It's neutral. Benefit for hodlers/lenders and an issue for spenders/borrowers. Some, however, claim it's an issue for the economy as a whole, due to a lack of spending, which is untrue.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:41:15
Exactly. Same considerations of saving in a high-return asset vs spending.

I get the value in holding your private keys, but stop fear-mongering about "endless litigation." Coinbase is offering their customers coins on both chains, so there's not much they can be sued about.

That inflationary incentive will start to disappear if Bitcoin continues to grow, since people will realize they don't have to experience inflation and will simply convert their USD to BTC.
Now that BTC is out there, people's considerations will evolve and old incentives will no longer work.

Thought experiment: how is the scenario of holding Bitcoins due to it's delationary nature any different from not spending the dollar, since it can be immediately converted into BTC and then held? Now that we have a BTC asset in our universe, any dollar could easily be put into that quickly appreciating asset, so the same opportunity cost applies whether you're spending the BTC or the dollar which you could convert into BTC. 
The point is, in day to day life we make trade-offs between investing in a high-return asset through savings, vs purchasing something we need today. People can't hold off on buying goods forever.

Hm. I purchased 5 minutes after opening the tab and the price didn't change, though other exchanges showed the price moving.
