Yes you are.  You're here telling everyone how you are offering him assistance and he isn't taking it(trusting you).  It looks like you're trying to put him in a corner so he'll work with **you**.  He is under no obligation to work with you.

Thanks for participating!  I don't like your solution because it punishes new comers and rewards people who have gamed karma over the years.. think about the dirty re-poster accounts, do you really want to reward them for just regurgitating other peoples content?  It would turn a lot of people off.

Identity Verification + Proof of Participation pretty much covers it.
  
People register and validate their identity, then they can link sock puppets to the verified identity(for anonymity) or use their real identity.  Then they particpate, mining happens through participation and it is a timed release(or not, this is flexible).  You participate 7 days a week, you get 7 shares of the pot, you miss a day, you get 6 shares.  It doesn't really matter if people come and participate just to get free redditbux, reddit inc is still getting identity info and can see if they particpate, what they participate in and for how long.  This is valuable data.  I guarantee some will become hooked and stick around, espeically if they think it might make them rich some day.  The Moon is the limit once this system is in place, they can use it for so much.
  
Any system that allows people to just use sock puppets to get a bigger share or to use karma that has been gamed will turn away users.  As an example: I have been using reddit for years but don't give a shit about karma and would be pissed if that somehow had monetary implications for me in the future.

I've been here for years, this is just one of my sock puppet accounts, I have many more.  This is how I recognize how easy it is to manipulate a thread and drive a conversation.  I've seen the same behavior with ChangeTip, and yes, I have identified quite a few of their sock puppets but would rather not expose them.  I'd just have to work harder figuring out who the new ones are.
The facts remain, ChangeTip stopped self promoting and the ChangeTips has died down dramatically.

Could be, but they made that mistake more than once, then edited the post for formatting but still missed it.

I can just as easily say that bitcoin succeeded in lieu of SR not because of SR.  Neither of us can prove it. 
 
edit:  I think I meant to say in spite of instead of in lieu of.  There is no way to quantify how many people turned away from bitcoin because of the SR stigma.  I have talked to a few people who admitted that they didn't look at bitcoin seriously until after SR was shut down because of SR and the negative perception it created for bitcoin.  So maybe bitcoin would have been accepted by the mainstream much sooner had SR not used it to facilitate illegal activity.

@_date: 2014-12-09 20:13:25
Those numbers don't mean a whole lot without the underlying data.  For starters, of the 1,230 unique senders, how many of those are verified to be actual individuals?  Or looking at it differently, how many of them are using reddit accounts that can absolutely be controlled by just a few people because no identity verification takes place when creating a reddit account?  I think you can see where that leads.  That's just the first question too.  These statistics don't mean shit without the underlying data and given the very aggressive self promotion here on reddit, I'm inclined to believe it is a lot less unique users than what they claim.

There is nothing stopping someone from using the same public hash to receive it is just a recommended best practice not to.  I've done it, I see merchants who do it and as long as you can secure your environment and you don't leave funds there, I don't see a problem with it.
  
In a way, if you're not accepting large amounts and can afford the risk, this kind of system can be the best indicator of a breach to your environment that I can think of.  A canary in a coal mine seems to fit as a description.  So I guess that's one reason to maybe do it..  big maybe.
I think your mention of reputation is interesting because I have been thinking about this a lot.  We need a tinyurl for addresses for sure.  In order for reputation to be applicable you need to be building a brand around your address.  The only way I see to do this directly and currently is with vanity addresses.  I myself do not trust them but it's what you need to start recognition because currently, addresses are pretty hard for most people to recognize.
The coinbase urls are very handy for this but I can see how you may not want to empower a 3rd party through your efforts, at least for free.

Not having any doubt ensures it.  Satoshi did not write that.  If he did, we wouldn't be here having this conversation.  He would not have signed it with his initials and confused its and it's, he has a demonstrated intolerance of such simple mistakes.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:34:35
I'm not a WU advocate or anything, but this "ad campaign" does more to hurt bitcoin than help it once people realize you can't just send any amount anywhere and be able to convert it to fiat currency like the graphic implies.  The amount of people that will realize that are probably small, so maybe it's not as big a deal as I think, but it's still misleading and a crappy ad.
  
When you send someone money using western union, you know the recipient is going to get cash they can spend.  Hopefully bitcoin adoption will take care of this but it is not the case right now.
  
Just hope this ad doesn't go viral or the late night comedians will be making another joke of bitcoin using this ad.

Don't start with me, Shillslayer, your arguments are weak.  First of all, you offer nothing to justify your statement that there isn't enough economic activity to justify the market cap.  Then you go on to say that the miners are going to somehow get code changed to get people to pay a higher fee so they can stay in business(just not going to happen).  This is survival of fittest, not some government program that can be changed at the whim of lawmakers to serve special interests.  Get with the program, this program even has a schedule!

Even if you take all of the steps you could possibly take in order to be in a position to completely not have to trust anyone, you almost definitely missed something and are lying to yourself.  Trust happens every time you power on your computer to the moment you turn it off and maybe even afterwards.  It's a big and complicated world.
  


  
Privacy is much more dynamic and nuanced than that.  Expectations of it at various levels are constantly adjusted based on activity and existing knowledge of the individual.  Something like sharing your *private* information with a company comes with a different expectation of privacy then say masturbating at home when nobody is around.

You are on the right track by advocating for a decentralized and open solution, but you need to stop referring to tipping as ChangeTip, it's a centralized and opaque entity and you're only helping to market it.

With a few exceptions the network effect only exists as long as reality supports it.
  
The reality is that bitcoin is the gold standard and has the network.  The network effect just helps ensure the network.  Making the argument that a sidechain is just like an offchain so why bother is ignoring the reality of the situation.  The reality is that a sidechain allows you to create your own monetary reserve.  The ability to do that is immense and an advantage that will amplify network effect.  It's a feedback loop that can only be stopped through some external force or it will continue to grow.  I'm betting on the latter.

As an example: Lets say you're a woman and you lead a perfectly normal life as far as everyone is concerned but when you are home, your husband beats you.  Then one night it is exceptionally bad and you decide you've had enough.  Are you going to be more or less apt to call the police if you know it's all being recorded and everything is going to be publicly available?

It's viral when many people are doing it, it's a pump when it's just a few.  Your own submission history is pretty damning.  So is the OPs.

I would never use a wallet thats first order of business is enumerating who I am in the social world.  No thank you.  You're going to need to use a carrot before you get that out of people.  Add local accounts and then advertise the added functionality of social integration within the app.

Thanks for that, that is the type of opinion I was looking for from them, but unfortunately their handlers won't let them have an opinion.

It came from both adopters and institutions.  And because of all of the investors before you who bought and held or had some sort of positive impact on the growth of price.

Why should he trust you?  This guy is constantly under attack with people trying to undermine what he is trying to do.  I would be suspicious of you too and would not follow your leads.

Their days are numbered, they cannot compete with the likes of NCR. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:28:13
Because it is blatant discrimination.  They are discriminating because it is bitcoin.  Go ask about funds backed by oil, gold and silver and you will not see any discrimination.  I care about discrimination.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:47:50
That's not how it works.  If there is an actual need for something, a competitor will offer it to fill that need.  This only punishes those who have trouble complying and that is usually startups and others who now have to overcome an artificial barrier to entry into the NY market.  This gives the well established an upper hand as they have teams of lawyers and tons of money they can use to comply with the law or ignore it and pay a small penalty when they are caught.  
  
The only way that his constituents are fucked as you say, is how they often end up with a lesser product because competition is stifled.  This sort of thing is hard to measure.

You just said: If you care about privacy you don't use a bank.  That is the dumbest thing I have read today and I have read a lot of dumb shit today.
  
Just because someone uses a service that does KYC does not mean that they do not care about privacy.  This is akin to some random person getting your bank account username.  It's one step closer to your bank account.  Do you run around advertising what bank you use and your online username for said bank account?  I really doubt it.
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:34:41
You're right. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:10:11
That is not true.  Businesses not present in NY will have to adhere to his regulations to do business in NY.  Exchanges would have to comply or stop serving the people of NY even though they may not have a physical presence there.

That is basically my take-away here.  I could almost understand if it wasn't something that I can buy with my retirement account, but I can.  And I have seen plenty of people asking about other commodities like silver, oil and gold, so I'm not seeing how bitcoin is different.
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:14:01


Can you point me at this?  I'd like to review that info.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:25:28
This should have nothing to do with any bull or bear sentiment.  I was just asking what people thought about this latest stock I can buy using my IRA.  There is tons of discussion on that subreddit about retirement accounts and stocks you can buy with them, but they are discriminating against bitcoin for some reason.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:38:33
It's now $175...

Ripple literally just makes more coins when they want to.  That does not scare me, it makes me laugh at anyone who would try and buy and hold XRP as an investment.
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:52:52


This is a symptom of the buy and hold aspect of a commodity, remember, bitcoin is more than a payment system and currency.  The price has been going down which does not encourage spending.  I myself did not spend any bitcoin on black friday as opposed to last year because of price.  Price goes up, people spend, price goes down, people hold.  Pretty simple stuff.
  


  
Wallet numbers and unique transactions says otherwise.  It's clear you're just trolling now, enjoy your new tag.

I can't explain why I don't trust it.

So you did know about his other account.  Yet you started by insisting he had one account.  You continue to show bias when it comes to ChangeTip and their activities here on reddit.  It's starting to look like a conflict of interest to me.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:59:55
Again, that is not true.  The well established players will be served by his regulations and they will offer the services that others cannot or will not.  Status quot will be preserved.  Ben cannot stop bitcoin, he can only stifle it in a way that benefits those in power, for those in power will not stand aside and allow an outsider to benefit unless it serves them in some way.  If they were to stand aside they would lose power.  That's going a little into the deep end but you get the idea.

It's amazing how our expectations have been formed.  We have been trained to give our information away for free by using services that serve a human need to be connected and now the very idea that you can get a few pennies for something you did for free is very compelling.  To that I say:  do not undersell yourself.  You are worth so much more!
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:10:23
I hope you realize that if you aren't an employee of ChangeTip, you're actually working for them for free.  You aren't doing anything to promote bitcoin, you're promoting ChangeTip.  ChangeTip is a centralized and opaque service.  Show me a decentralized and open one, and I'll join you, except I'll throw real money at it so that people can actually spend their tips.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:17:09
They only allowed that through because they kept getting hammered and they are moderating the shit out of it.  Try and submit a link to a chart or the ticker on otc markets that provides real information about GBTC and bitcoin.  Why can you only see 5 of the 9 comments submitted.  They want to control the conversation completely is my guess.  Total shit sub.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:45:11
I was specifically asking what they thought about GBTC.  I wasn't asking for general advice.  I asked what they thought, I linked to the ticker symbol for context and linked to bitcoinwisdom so they could check real-time exchange prices.  It took a bunch of rejections to even get a thread allowed through and it's a terrible thread with no context for the discussion.  It has no links to the ticker symbol and no links to charts so people can form an opinion using real data.  Some of the replies make me cringe.  I'm staying far away from that shit hole.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:05:51
They have way less subscribers but maybe the overall quality is higher?  I mostly found the answers I was looking for, thank you for the suggestion.

I don't understand how that works.  It's now $175 with the same percentage..
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:49:45
Discrimination should never be the norm and when you see it, you should call it out so that others are aware.  I wasn't aware that discriminated but i am now and I won't be using that sub.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:56:33
They told me they wouldn't allow bitcoin related posts.  Telling me to remove links and implying that will let it through and also telling me that you won't allow bitcoin related posts is retarded.  It's retarded because it's a contradiction.  I also spelled out how that directly contradicted another submission on the front page that had links.  Your sub is shit and now I know.  You won't see me participating there.
  
Also, someone else messaged me a thread they submitted that had no links and it was also filtered, which is yet another contradiction.  I'm guessing someone else decided to have some common sense and let one through.  Too bad it's not that great of a submission and lacks any context for the discussion, but maybe that's what you want..
