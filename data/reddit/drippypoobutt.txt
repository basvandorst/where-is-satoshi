There used to be a bitcoin lottery back in the day.  People seemed to like it, what happened?

Cant you loan to people who want to short on Bitfinex?
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:28:14
So how does this get fixed?
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:28:35
I just subscribed and it went up
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:52:47
Access to stable currency.  60 EU a day.  How nice of them.

I think its Eric Vorhees.  He has lots of extra money and pumps litecoin on twitter sometimes.  Thats all the evidence I have. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:58:03
Purse is amazing.

So are the gems tokens limited in supply?  Can we expect the value of gems to go up as this gets more popular?  I think I"ll buy some?
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:27:46
People selling their LTC for BTC pumps the price of BTC
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:18:11
At least they are honest.

Congrats to the litecoiners that got in for the bull run.  I will not be buying at this moment though.

It is most certainly an anti Bitcoin product.  The creator has been anti bitcoin for years.  I hate to give him business, but I feel this one anti-bitcoin piece goes well with my collection and will be good for laughs in the future. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:49:23
Fun idea, a little too expensive though.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:55:38
Ah, true. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:09:19
Facebook bitcoin exchange, and ETF to be launched tomorrow. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:18:34
no thanks I'll pass :p

Create a wish list with the product you want.  Submit to purse, pick your discount, someone buys it, you get it, you release the funds. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:50:37
Yes, I haven't used it yet.  I've heard lots of good things about it.  Bitcoin sellers get items from Amazon at nice discounts.  I'm about to try it.

Hey bucky you have great tutorials on Youtube.  Thanks for teaching me Javascript.  Good luck with this.
@_date: 2015-07-22 04:27:13
I believe there are around 10k that have been made.
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:23:53
Is this something that he is excited about or is he upset?
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:25:42
Will it be that easy? Didn't over 60% of the population vote against a milder form of this just a few days ago?  I'm not sure how this all works.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:33:00
Trying to understand what that means.  Cant just 1 bitcoin represent the value? How many shares are there? Are there shares?
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:46:34
no it is not
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:35:03
Hm guess I'm not understanding.  Purse IO lets people spend amazon gift credits and receive Bitcoin in return.  
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:21:16
ok well thats great then.  Thank you.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:17:27
If I hear the words "killer app" one more time I'm going to diarraeh all over the place. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:53:24
Actually it seems like every bubble we've had has come to an abrupt end with gox fucking up somehow.  I have to wonder how high some of these bubbles would have gotten if not for Gox getting hacked or DDOS'd.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:22:35
Thats why I always replenish right away after I buy something.

I think there were alot of wars fought before fiat money came into existence.  Maybe they didn't last as long though.
