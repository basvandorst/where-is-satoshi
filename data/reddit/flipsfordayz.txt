@_date: 2017-11-10 12:23:53
not worried about losing the money but losing when playing a game sucks 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:03:03
I check every 5ish minutes often kill my phone battery and then get worried when I can't check the price lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:11:17
So still wondering do I start buying bch or just buy more btc or are both valuable at this point it makes sense that one will die and one will survive what if we are betting on the wrong horse because of foolish pride 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:10:37
What if the whole fork was planned to cancel from the beginning knowing it would moon the price of btc and show the world how "invincible" bitcoin really is. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:43:44
So in everyones opinion
 is it like a guarantee it's gonna dip back down following segwitx2 or is that just speculation and it could go up more?
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:18:00
So it could go either way probably with wider daily fluctuation range?  At least till the dust settles 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:21:02
I'm worried.... it's probably just heavy traffic but like I got 23$ of bitcoin their and I'm worried about it what if they getting hacked?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:04:58
So I guess it's a good time to buy? And what is the deal with bitcoin cash is it a threat to regular btc
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:07:20

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:27:09
At the end of the day my coins are in a trezor so might as well just hodl and buy more but I have not considered bitcoincash untill now so should I grab it as well
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:06:33
Lol I was able to convince 8 friends to buy bitcoin and gave them my referal link for coinbase I'm getting a bunch of free coin feels very good 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:37:36
Lol waves coffee house in Canada accepts bitcoin so you can buy a coffee and a cinnamon bun if your in Canada 
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:03:37
I use debit card from chequing account I'm with td is weird that it takes so long for some as your not the only case i have heard of it taking over a week
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:16:41
So you just plug um together and it let's you transfer your bitcoin over?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:56:47

What is a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:09:25
The journey is long and filled with distractions don't let yourself drop on the roadside I'm only at 0.04 and I only started 2 weeks ago but I feel confident with my strategy and feel the momentum growing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:31:28
I figured the more people know the faster it becomes mainstream and the faster it grows in value and infrastructure
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:49:07
Also I would suspect as the miners are hitting the last couple mill coins they will just stop selling them to exchanges and individuals and hodl them protecting them with value in case some mining operations do fail to profit off tx fees, Also as I understand processing transactions and collecting fees is easier setups compared to the computational  requirements of mining so their maintenance costs to sustain their operation would lower.

What is a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:25:38
Ya I'm Canada as well, coinbase excepts debit or credit and usually takes less then 10 min to fully complete the transaction and have the coins in coinbase then add on the 15-30 mins to transfer from coinbase to a safer wallet and your well under an hour in total.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:17:42
I get the trezor in 2 days so I'm far ahead of B2X but is the fork on the 25th of October a problem?  I currently use jaxx so I'm just hoping I don't mess anything up. 
Also on a side note I plan on leaving 20$ of bitcoin in coinbase and jaxx 10$ each during the B2X fork on purpose to experiment see what exactly happens from those platforms 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:13:42
I don't own a computer I have done everything on phone lol probably so unsafe
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:35:38
No thanx I'm not ready yet I want to buy a lot more before then
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:57:20
I'm like totally chill losing the money I put in since I would have lost it anyways, so anytime I even think about spending on stupid shit I pull out my phone and buy bitcoin with it instead 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:07:22
How much is trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:28:47
This makes no sense I get my coins from coinbase in under 10 mins every time and then out of coinbase onto jaxx in 30 mins, how did you pay them? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:28:20
So other then that is jaxx ok or should I switch well I wait for the Trevor?
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:05:37

@_date: 2017-10-20 06:27:08

We bury it in dirt up here or  in the washer fades the color but it's hard to launder our money fortunately everyone here gets a decent wage so most people use illegal cash flow for basic stuff like grocery or rent I'm sure major criminal groups have their own infrastructure for laundering large amounts but most of our money laundering is done through weed dispensaries currently as almost all dispensaries are owned by organized gangs and not regulated by any government body 
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:59:58
