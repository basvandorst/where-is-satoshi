A shortage of USD? well wheres all your USD? How can you get USD? Can you ju8st buy some USD then think it will magicly grow into a lambo? or do you have to earn USD? What's more valuable idiot?

of course, in the first instance its worthless and a non-event and as for XRP they are a non-event on the coattails of a non-event.
Im much more bullish on XLM and a few of the up and comming cryptos. How can people not realise that BTC is Yahoo?
Anyway I'm out 20hrs ago now and shorti8jmnmg after being in from an avg price of $582! haha bitches! ENJOY!
