How will you be able to tell when people stop watching the wallet?

I loaded onto gox to do trading, right before the first "Mt. Gox is Mt. Vesuvius" post.  I began to withdraw 100 btc every 24 hours after that but I wasn't able to get even half of it out.

That's a nice retort, but I preferred it when your ilk used "wake up sheeple!"

If you made a late (say around january ) BTC deposit into the exchange, do you have a better or worse chance of getting back BTC?  
Also, if you had BTC but no fiat under your account, is there a greater chance of getting that back?

Hope springs eternal, but I just can't trust that subtle smirk.  If I get my money back I'll kiss that greasy fat fuck square on the lips.

Einstein probably never said that:

There is no guarantee they are gone forever, a lot of the information on Reddit is skewed.  We know from block chain analysis that Gox still controlled a good number of coins, we know from irc chats with anarchystar that Mark Karpeles kept a good portion of bitcoin out of the assert list when he filed for bankruptcy so it could be paid out as bitcoin and not fiat.
Your chances of getting BTC back are much higher than your chances of getting fiat.

6 hours?  They told me 3!

This sounds like it was written by that little shit we protested Milton Friedman's economics award.

Dude, your ignorance of Japan is shining through.

I agree that this statement should have been reported.  But it is confusing to say that "830k coins are gone" and then "we are working on the problem" right afterwards.  Without any details I mean.
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:30:38
A grossmy misleading statement, it looks like you are equating the two.

Great, the only thing missing now is a place to sign up.

All economics is pseudoscientific drivel.

Well, after 30 minutes on hold I was basically told that the sole purpose of the call center was to point callers to the website, which will be updated "in two to three hours".  They also took my name down.  I wish I'd recorded the call because the engrish was hilarious.

Is this just another joke, or should I facepalm?

I'm getting my wallet address tattooed on my chest as we speak.
