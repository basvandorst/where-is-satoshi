Shit that took me a minute to get but daaamnnn sick burn
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:44:52
This was a great read

I like the ritual.  Plus I only automate Gators.

I've found that it's a better idea to just wait until a crash and buy then.  It's way easier to predict that a crash has just recently happened than to predict if a crash is going to happen soon.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:53:54
Seems about right, yeah
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:28:15
Yeah I've had great success with DCA since I worked it into my daily routine.
Step 1.) Wake up and make coffee
Step 2.) Drink coffee and buy your daily Bitcoin
Step 3.) Drink coffee and look at the price of Bitcoin
Notice I don't pay very much attention to the price until after I've bought my morning share.  After that, I work on my other strategies.  It's been a great decision.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:52:03
That happened to me there weeks ago.  There were no coins in there, I'd already transferred them out and bought shit when bitcoin was like $300 or so.  I was disappointed in myself, should have held half and spent half :/
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:25:18
That's probably not the biggest reason
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:00:30
This is why I finally took the time to figure out some alternative to coinbase for buying crypto.  My intention was to buy Dash at $135, but I didn't already have an account anywhere that let me do that with my bank account. So, next best thing I guess was to move assets into Dash from other stuff on Binance and then buy Bitcoin from Coinbase so I can convert it to Dash....but they have an 8-Day hold for moving btc off of their platform.
In those 8 days the price of Bitcoin has gone from $7k down to $6.4k while Dash has started to regain ground and come up to $175.  Gosh diddily dang it!
I have an uphold account now and it's pretty damned convenient, so far I recommend it.
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:50:08
Thank you for this, it clarified the same misunderstanding for me and also made me like the implementation more.
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:06:41
I'm not an expert on this, but I think it depends on what you want your ISP to see.  If you connect to a VPN through tor, your ISP will know that you're using tor but not necessarily that you're going through a VPN.  The other way around, if you connect to your VPN first, your ISP is less likely to know that you're using tor but will know that you're using a VPN.
So, what country are you in? Is tor suspicious or banned? Are VPNs?  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I see it.
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:08:38
My opinion is yes.
@_date: 2015-12-19 22:02:57
I like them, I've used them a lot and feel comfortable with their service.
@_date: 2019-03-12 19:42:22
I get that there's a preference here, but "nobody?"
It's okay to have multiple successful projects, no reason to get butthurt about it.  Even Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash can coexist. 
Blasphemy, I know.
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:55:02
Some are using Dash, via SMS since cell service still works for now.
@_date: 2019-03-15 02:20:41
Crypto over SMS is working there a bit, from what I've read. On dumb phones, which is pretty cool.
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:14:24
Where do you get that idea?  Of all the hundreds of coins, it's one of the better projects and their developers are funded and organized.  They've already been working on integration for Venezuelan payments and remittances before the blackout, and now it's one of the only ways to pay without power or a smartphone.  
I'm not knocking this subs favorite project, I like it plenty, but it seems unrealistic to deny that dash is a decent option in the country.  A bunch of local merchants accepted it directly before the blackout
@_date: 2019-03-15 13:53:04
Damn that blows
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:37:35
I've been using Uphold for a while and it has been great
@_date: 2019-03-12 19:47:04
I mentioned this as well but apparently the idea that any single person that exists anywhere is using Dash is laughable.
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:06:12
How did it deviate so much?
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:24:50
You think so?  That's an interesting idea, I wonder if there's much evidence to look at in that regard?  I'd love a place to start
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:49:03
@_date: 2019-08-01 12:36:45
Dude just doesn't understand math is all
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:02:31
It's not just a feeling, that's always a possibility
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:07:45
There's probably going to be a retrace at some point where you can buy the dip.  Now that it's in full-on mechabullzilla mode, buying the dip is what I'll be doing instead of just randomly accumulating
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:39:45
Of some good OC
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:05:45
Quick, sell before it goes down too far!  Ah shit it's going back up now, FML...
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:25:12
Damn, and I didn't go shopping yesterday.  Sorry everyone.  I'll pick it up today, I'll be going to the grocer anyway.  Price should recover as soon as it's brewed...please stand by...
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:56:12
I just closed on one a couple of weeks ago, I'm not worried about it since it's something I enjoy (swimming pool, yay!) and my homestead.  I wouldn't have done so if it were an investment property though.
I was thinking a out this yesterday though while I was floating in the pool, smoking a joint, and watching the birds.  Lots of great thinking gets done that way, and this time I thought about diversifying my investments with real estate when the crash somes, the timing seems incredibly interesting
@_date: 2019-02-17 13:58:13
Somehow the word "before" was injected into my sentence.

Mt. Gox had a ton of BTC stolen.  U less that happens to coinebase, I doubt it.  If if it did happen, it would take years for the order to liquidate would come down.  We're good to go for a little while
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:06:15
What kind of coffee?  I'll go shopping

Howso?  I find his emails and podcast interviews pretty damned good.

But surely THAT repost was a repost of some good OC

I see it as saying "you've only got a year or so left to buy more before at the bottom"

Can you keep the community updated on your dad's opinion of crypto so we know where the peaks and valleys are please?  You should start one of those practice trading accounts that only buy and sells based on the inverse of Dad's opinion and see what happens.

What's up with those enormous tv/monitor/terminal mirrors in the background right in front of his desk chair?  I get that maybe he can't see well, but does he also have an eye on the side of his head?  It's not even an extended workspace, it's just a green terminal with giant letters that's mirrored on two televisions less than three feet from his desk chair.

@_date: 2019-05-24 20:17:19
This seems like a good thing overall, for research purposes.  I heard someone say that altcoins we're excellent R&amp;D for Bitcoin, I think that's a great point and we should be happy about all of the work BCH is doing to experiment with ideas.  We get to see how those changes work in reality and learn from it.
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:07:56
Good.  And who tf cares if a clever miner takes a bunch of segwit-address-locked coins anyway, is t that what it was all about?  I mean sure, it's not "right", but is that something to completely destroy your ethos over and flex your ownership of the hashrate for?
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:25:52
You spelled BUY wrong
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:48:39
I was thinking about this yesterday, great point.  I hadn't expected Trump to do that and so I never really factored that into my speculation.  If big money starts assisting into Bitcoin to weather the trade war..... Holy fuck
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:00:22
Trade war sparked, stock market crash fears, US politician proposing a bill to ban Bitcoin, it's May (the predicted start of the bull run, the halvening is approaching, more people know what Bitcoin is now than ever before, investment advice from huge and respectable companies now includes holding cryptocurrency, France set rules for their banks that require them to support crypto, lots of stuff all at once.
Plus there's no real way to predict how high or low it will go and when, it's a brand new thing that the world has never seen.
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:22:33
That's the thing that I don't get about BCH, there are other coins that have already figured out how to do what they're trying to do, but waaaay better.  Look at all of the outstanding work that Dash has done to create instant transactions with low fees and 51% attack protection and privacy options and human readable addresses coming down the pipe and on and on.  Divi is doing something similar and developing their own version of LN and making onramping super easy and taking Dash's masternode concept and playing around with that in interesting ways that helps get people involved.
It's just....why.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:57:12
Yeah but why is 1337 not the crypto price and instead the price of a wire?
