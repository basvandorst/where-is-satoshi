When an article title contains "Here's why" you already know it's wrong.

It is inconvenient because the whole system if full of security holes. And as a seller I would never accept Paypal, the refund system is just bullshit. No refunds with Bitcoin.

Everyone creating ICOs are scammers. Even bitcoin maximalists who now are starting to create ICO tokens. And the guy in the video is a scammer too because he is also involved with ICOs.

have you tried Kraken?

Libra is a stablecoin. So basically it's just a Paypal. I think Argentineans can have a Paypal account and keep the amount there in USD, same as other services like XOOM, Neteller, etc. So libra is basically the same, but instead of USD, its libra. Libra will not offer anything more than what Paypal offers.

OK but in terms of fraud nothing comes close to what I witnessed in the crypto space. I used to believe those guys wearing suits and working at the big banks were all corrupt but then I learned that the guys wearing cool t-shirts working in crypto projects are even more corrupt.

I don't dislike fiat because I view fiat merely as a temporary exchange tool. Instead I dislike banks. Be your own bank is what bitcoin is about.

How much for the initial investment including electrician?

All these changes to Bitcoin seem risky to me. Bitcoin development should be kept to the very minimum possible. Bitcoin has proven secure as it is, why risk implementing changes to supposedly improve security of something that is already secure?

No but I have OCD, seeing a cord plugged in the car gives me anxiety.

If you mean fuel cell electric car, then you may have a point.

Can you have a Paypal account and keep the balance in USD?

It really looks very scammy. The thing is, that "CEO" probably is some dumb idiot hired to act like the CEO while the real exchange owners are hidden somewhere.

It looks like bad pizza, real pizza doesn't look like that

Having to plug a cord in the car every night is insanely annoying.

Well not too bad. A Kylie Jenner tweet erased 1.3 billion market cap from Snapchat last year.

The best solution is to have more chip makers creating asics.

Thailand and Vietnam both have highly skilled workers, also many more skilled workers in countries like Japan. I'm not sure why even manufacture in China given the risk of your tech being stolen. Japan for example, is moving much of their tech plants to Thailand and Vietnam and also back to Japan.
@_date: 2019-05-05 22:07:49
You are over analyzing the whole thing. I think that it's simply a matter of moving manufacturing to countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, etc. Actually a lot has been moving to these countries already because China isn't cheap anymore and also there's the trust issue.

Come on, show us a single useful dapp, after five years, most dapps are based on random numbers generation and used to create lottery type scams.
How many billions $$$ were created out of thin air and not result in a single useful dapp?

Corruption is rampant in the crypto community, I think even more corrupt than central bankers and government.
