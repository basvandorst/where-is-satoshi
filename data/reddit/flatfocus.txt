It would be soooooooooo funny if CSW faked all the contracts so he could pretend to be Satoshi, but the only people he actually convinced were Kleiman's family, and then they sue him for 10 billion dollars.

But what's more likely: The dead guy's family wants to get $10 Billion, or they want to get CSW to state whether or not he's Satoshi on record? Gotta guess the former.

So wait a screenshot?
Also the case against CSW is that he was telling people he was the creator behind the scenes for a long before it ever became public, in order to get people to invest in his business, etc. People lie to their parents all the time and it's possible he said something about it to him

I think part of the beauty of naming a third person is that later one when/if some really compelling evidence comes up regarding the REAL Satoshi, CSW can just go "yeah duh, I mentioned a third person".
Assuming the real Satoshi denies everything (insanely likely), CSW isn't contradicted.

Read this blog post from today, the 12hR address is actually an internal MtGox address: 
That's pretty darn concrete too, since all the MtGox addresses are well documented.

With all due respect, if you're claiming he's not REALLY insufferable and it's just a personality he created, the burden of proof is on you, and huge.
