100 ema on a weekly chart or something like that shows support around 5-6k. It's not entirely impossible...

I get excited, cos most of my money is in fiat and I am waiting to buy all my coins at the low.

I love how your emotions turn from absolute disgust and panic if you are hodling, into sweet excitement if you have fiat.

The worst part of FOMO is that I feel less anxious hodling coins that are bleeding than having spare fiat on hand.

lol, was late for LTC so took a loss. Made up for it with the following ETH bump. Now back onboard the BTC train.

Ppl can laugh, but this is what stopped me and a friend buying Bitcoin 6 years ago. We thought you had to buy a whole coin which was too much at the time for us....not saying we would have lambos by now, but it would have been useful following the topic since then instead of only joining the bandwagon this year.

To be honest, 7 years ago when I first briefly mentioned Bitcoin to a friend and we talked about getting in on it, what put us off was the price. We thought you had to buy a whole coin :P

I only have a few hundred invested. Can I still have a lambo?

isn't it the unwritten rule that you can't post anything that resembles being anti bitcoin here?

c'mon BTC. Fight for my love!

How far is Mordor really? And is it actually feasible to get there via eagle like most people think?

Eventually he'll get that lambo

Exactly what I would do if I was a whale. You know eventually the market will go up so I'd be spending as much time as possible accumulating at the cheapest prices possible and trying to drive the market down until I get bored. Sucks for traders though.

Reddit is picking a side

I got in early for this bounce. 
Like, 2 weeks early.
