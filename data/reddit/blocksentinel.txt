He's a desperate man who thinks we are all fools. 
If the malleability issue wasn't farcical enough (In the 3 years that it was a known vuln the hackers would have had to fake transactions and successfully get them committed to the blockchain at the rate of 750BTC a day for over 1000 days straight...shorter time frames head exponentially to the absurd given the BTC increase required and the resending of the transactions had to be authorised).
Now he wants us to believe an attack on the web servers/cluster could somehow back door the hot (3% BTC holdings) and cold wallet (97% BTC holdings). 
What sort of an operation is this? Were the web servers on the same network as the business servers (and not in a DMZ) so knocking them over could give you escalated privileges and network access on the reset or were the hot wallets on the web servers or were the private keys on the webservers?!?!
Or are they trying to say the hack actually on a completely different vector (I should have never clicked on that anime attachment?!?!) and the DDoS was the perfect smokescreen for the wholesale emptying of the company accounts without anybody noticing as they were too busy on the phone to Cloud flare?!?!
Just hurry up and drag this through the courts...we need to know what *really* happened...

We're looking for penetration in Africa...but it's not the sort they're offering...;-)

With SPV clients they don't have to (which may go some way to explaining the lesser amount of full nodes)

2 hours apart (Needs confirmation but I was told by a user that the bot that handled transactions would resend after 2 hours if the transID didn't hit the chain)
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:00:56
It makes me wonder if there's an equivalent rise in mobile/SPV clients to offset this and the diminishing full nodes is actually a secular (or long term) trend as opposed to temporary and based on price and profitability...?!?!

Head of Security @ Bitcoin here...we knew that but busy writing advice for customs agents...

I'd still like confirmation. Automatic processing makes sense as manually processing the (what would probably be thousands of) continually failed transactions from a limited number of accounts (granted in the early days small trans could be anonymous) required for the malleability exploit to lift 400000-800000 coins would/should have raised an alarm...
Really it's just more cold water poured on the theft by malleability claim

While the actual financials are pretty opaque (apart from some deep data analysis of the blockchain)...a quick search on reddit would have found a reasonable body of evidence from independent redittors (with history and standing of their own) who can vouch for the sincerity and determination of Jason in relation to this project.

It's the natural gravitation towards monopoly (an evolution if you will)...if the code was ASIC resistant, it would be GPU farms...if it was GPU resistant, it would be CPU farms...fighting the success of an application while supporting the criterion for it's success (i.e profit) is the apitomy of futility...

There's nothing wrong with questioning the transparency of any charity you may donate to &amp; perhaps an audit or some sort of breakdown of expenses would give the BTC community a little more faith in his charity... but...after following Jason's efforts for over a year now, I believe he has shown his vision and commitment to this project consistently &amp; repeatedly, including a sound fiduciary attitude and mgmt to the endowment to aid the homeless of Pensacola (&amp; the good name if Bitcoin) in the memory of his dear friend via the vehicle we know as Sean's Outpost...so...I have no problem jumping on this tip train! :-p

Yeah...pretty much the easiest way you could assert control over any account is to be able to send msgs on it's behalf. I'll leave the bulk pwd reset traffic on a known exploit to the more security savvy ;-)

Nice take. What confused me is his time frame (or lack of it). He's saying it's slightly undervalued now but there's nowhere near the mainstream use to base the figures on currently for velocity and he admits that the precious metals comparison is yet to be achieved. 
I'd also add the remittance market is a way off from his figures and he missed the appeal  to the unbanked which would add far more to BTC than the competition.
It's like being over and undervalued simultaneously

I worked out the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since inception for a finance friend a couple of months ago (while extolling the virtues of BTC) came to an eye watering 240+% I think the only thing growing faster on the planet currently is bacteria
