Well, I’m glad that those leverage trading promoters on youtube are getting censored, because too many innocent people are losing money because of them for blindly trusting them and gambling all of their. $$

If you just buy bitcoin and wont trade any altcoins and let it just be, how can you go wrong with it? I’m not convincing anyone, I’m just writing my opinions.

If you wont sell, then you wont lose, simple as that.
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:34:10
Everyone is saying dont invest more than you can afford to lose. You cant go wrong with bitcoin and this might be opportunity of a lifetime and investing 100 dollars wont help much.
