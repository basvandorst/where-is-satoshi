Seriously guys, why do you use Kraken? Are you newbie or something?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:37:34
People who don'T know they can buy fratcions of Bitcoin and as well people willing to invest 10$ or 1000$ in Bitcoin are not useful to Bitcoin development nor price rise
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:40
why not? are you trolling or talking seriously?

I would like but I love the GDAX 0% fee policy for makers

My colleague sold at 18.000$. He is chill, not you. On 2014 Btc when down for more than 12 months, from 1.000$ to 150$....

Actually this one is a +45% correction on Coinbase/Gdax. On other exchanges a +40%. Highest of the year

If you still work in a company you are not a real "bitcoin guy".
Real bitcoiners (not me unfortunately) already quit low paid jobs
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:21:32
it is clearly real like it was real the Chinese intention to ban the exchanges. The thing we don'T know is when. I read somewhere should be not before June 2018
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:37:04
North Korea and Venezuela are clearly enemies of Bitcoin. The US are a lot more a friend of Bitcoin than Venezuela

@_date: 2017-11-14 21:10:55
yes, I gived up on Kraken and moved my cryptos to Bitfinex about 4 months ago. it is the worst platform I ever tried (and i tried many, from Poloniex, to Btcc to Bittrex)

Bitcoin needs at least a 10,000X (ten thousands) capacity increase honestly. I'm not kidding. If we want a mass adoption of Btc the SW 3X capacity increase and then 25% Shnoor is just bullshit improvements. Only Lightning seems interesting but still not very efficient ( you need to open a channel for every different shop where you ipotetically buy something plus as you said you have to lock some Btc in the channels...).
Honestly i think a block increase but not 2X, at least 100MB block it would be good for the long term (plus lightning, Sw and everything)
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:34:57
none is big enough to manipulate Btc price for mid or long term
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:21:05
yes it is. with that kind of approach at the first issue/defeat the normal people will run away
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:41:04
wow, that's so much! in the long term this number will increase for sure
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:48:38
yes you said it, 100MB is the answer
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:41:25
thank you! that's a lot! and it will increase to even more in the future!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:17:29

Italians as well used to eat cats. The meat is white, low fat and taste good reported my grandma

so they are the ones who will lose everything when there will be the big crash, the big one (maybe in three months, maybe in 5 years). It's always like that, the youngest are the ones who get skrewed l the time
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:14:10
ok, i get it. that's a good explanation! one more question then, one tennis ball is the Bitcoin we have right now I suppoese. The other tennis ball will have another name (like "Bitcoin sometihng"), like it was when it was created Bcash?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:28:09
Uh! A lot! Source? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:17:51
great explanation, thnaak you!
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:33:05
no, better Btc. just saying the most f the youngest will get burnt
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:40:39
There is something suspicious in Korea being the biggest buyer (or second biggest) for Bitcoin and crypto in general. It is not big enough country by population and GDP for being the main buyer in the cryptos
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:47:03
Of course 16MB wont be enough. I think in the mid/long term will be necessary something like 100MB blocks.... 
But most of the people talking here are not smart enough to understand it. they think in 2020 or 2030 that 1MB blocks wil be enough.... Meanwhile in 2017 with 2MB blocks we are paying extremely high fees and waiting transaction time of hours, thinking lightning will end all these problems ahahhaha or thinking the 50% efficiency gained with Shnorr and SW will help ahahhaha
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:11:15
What I mean is that some exchanges don't have fees on buying and selling, but fee only to withdraw.
so if you need to do a lot of operations they are better.
didn't you know it? lol

@_date: 2017-04-24 21:09:23
thak you for answering, i ll take a look to BitMex
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:14:08
There will be for them maybe one or more than one Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero, DigixDAO, Bcash or many many others. There is competition out there. Not only Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:27:17
it'S not politically correct but not all the people are the same, one thing is if 5% of German people decide to invest in Btc, another thing is if 5% of Congolese people decide to invest. REsult will be totally different
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:10:15
data pls
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:26:07
not 99% of whites and far east asian people. that's totally true instead for hispanics, mulatto and blacks, I mean african american
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:09:52
African people haven't much money to invest. I heard of people investing like 5$ through intermediaries in african villages... they will be not a big help for Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:10:08
is also buying crypto in Germany VAT exempt? the article is not totally clear to me
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:12:50
yes ok but consider that Malta is not a serious country. it is just a micro-state quite corrupted and with many problems...
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:13:10
i partially agree with your post. The only part I don't agree is when you say "people from just 20 countries". You miss the "G", it is the people from economic Giant 20 countries. They represent over 80% of the world GDP. I mean they are everything. Richer like 40 times the whole Africa............................................... 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:58:57
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:13:17
Thank you Africa... but I don't know how much money you guys have to invest... i mean people are starving over there... they are not able to buy food, how they can buy Btc..
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:12:24
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled

*fluctuates by 5% "and grows a lot" I would add.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:52:44
98% of people buy crypto on exchanges. Exchanges can be regulated or even soppressed (like in China....)
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:11:43
Chinese people not only buy Btc on Chinese platforms but also on Taiwanese (Bitfinex), Singaporean and American platforms. They are sure a lot more than 15-18% of total volume. Anyway you really think that 18% of Volume doesn't count that much??? China is becoming the biggest Superpower in the world. Everybody needs China, Bitcoin included.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:07:53

Also that list doens't mention who is not supporting it.

Maybe yes anyway in general I trust very little businessinsider, it's a fake news website

Nice post but I hate reading "to the moon!!!"
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:07:22
yes, i was just kidding.
you can also buy at Kraken.com
You made them a bank wire and then you start buying and selling Bitcoin.
Kraken, like Coinbase, is a US based exchange for cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:20:56
maybe. or "sell the news"

@_date: 2017-05-25 14:19:59
ahaha, u serious? putting at risk a 45B $ industry?? no miners and exchanges will follow UASF. Too risky and too much to lose.
why Segwit with 2MB block is not fine? why this 2MB is a problem?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:18:54
time will tell
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:20:46

I think the bubble is popping up, it will takes months to recover, but this is just my opinion.
with the bubble of dicember 2013 it tooks more than an year to recover...

Bitfury is around 2.6% of hashpower
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:24:55
You have to wait. Watch Litecoin chart after SegWit was activated. It crashed one day after activation.
Bitcoin maybe could wait one day and crashing around 2500$ or lower. Maybe it will take longer and it will crash after a week... But one thing i am sure, it will go back around 2500$. Now stay out and Wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Danger!

thank you. I suppose Shapeshift is an Exchange which has low volume, am i right?
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:02:08
yes, I notice that to. 
Why you consider blockchain.info not totally trustable?
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:54:00
i'm sad for you. Tomorrow this time you will be losing around 8 or 9%
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:32:42
c'mon man, get a life after Bitcoin!
Segwit2X is gonna happen. Period.
UASF is too late (1st August), Segwit2X has got large support by miner and happen before (end of July).
is it that difficult to understand?
No UASF, go to the park with a dog, relax
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:15:16
thank you for the feedback. What is your country and what is the Exchange you are referring?

in this case this stop on Coinbase doens't refer to the Bip91. Plus the stop to withdrwaal/deposit if will happen will last very short because with Bip91 there will be not split chain on 1st August with Bip148

sorry for the many question, i just want to understand
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:55:19
I'll buy below 2300 $ some, like 40% of my money.
Then if the price will cointinue go down, I'll buy more.
Below 2000 $ I'll go "all in"
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:45:52
this means it stopped signalling BIP91. They are around 1% of the total mining hashpower if i remember well
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:42:46
not be offended. also it is not your fault you are in the top of the channel reddit. Your story is nice. But me i also you reddit and twitter to help me being updated and often on Reddit to find some interesting news you have to scroll over 100 threads
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:35:20
Can we have important news in the top threads or at least funny stuff instead of teenager saving 100 bucks in Bitcoin? I mean nothing personal Nemo, I like your story, just saying should not be in the top 5 posts in Bitcoin reddit
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:54:16
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:42:07
dont know, stop signalling doesnt resolve the problem
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:35:31
Bitfury is around 2,5%. Maybe they stopped for a reason related to the BTC1 bug found by Greg MAxwell. Or maybe just a temporary problem. I think this is a short term problem.

yes, Bitcoin.com as well started signalling BIP91 a couple hours ago
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:37:36
no, i would say now just wait. Wait the price to go down, just that.

@_date: 2017-06-04 07:51:59
Check chart by yourself, from November 2013  to March 2014 Bitcoin. It's not difficult, don't waste time on Reddit, Reddit is just entertainment 
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:12:58
excuse me for a question maybe "stupid". Are this people and organizations you cited people who left Coinbase like Charlee. Or you mean they are people who left Bitcoin and moved to work for Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:20:02
Thanks for your explanation. Just trying to understand as much as possible to make my investment decisions
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:35:12
My opinion man. I wrote one time before this one that I think we're in a bull trap.
 Is it this you mean for "every other day"? Lol
Do you think I, just a normal guy with even poor English, could influence Bitcoin market writing a post or two on Reddit??? Lol
 It's just my opinion man! I could be right, I could be wrong. Time will says, not you.
