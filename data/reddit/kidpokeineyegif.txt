1. 
Mining for bitcoin is centralised in china. How much has power do they control?
I am in crypto to make money: I am not invested in bitcoin because I want to make money and think that other crypto has a much brighter future.
2. Taken from the lightning network whitepaper:
"If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage."
3. Apologies I thought this point was really a re has of the first point. The community disagreement between bitcoin cash and bitcoin resulted in bitcoin cash going for bigger blocksizes.  Because this became the point of difference many people in the bitcoin community are holding onto the idea that bigger block sizes are bad: otherwise what is the difference? 1mb block sizes were decided on when everything was a lot smaller: if block size increases had kept up with the inflation of computer power and storage then they would ahve already increased. 
I thinkt here is an voerall view in this subreddit that bitcoins problems are as a result of attacks and that any competitor is "evil". Just looka t how roger ver (who i dont care for one way or another) is blamed when the price drops. 
Apologies if I seem agressive: it wasnt my intention btu I cans ee reading over what I wrote that I come across very blunt. I think that when things are over text interpretation is in the eye of the beholder.

Ummm, yes maybe use an actual source next time. But here are pending eth transactions:
Here are pending bitcoin transactions:
Please point to a time since the start of december where pending ethereum transactions were even half of bitcoin pending transactions. I am not even going to mention fees because I think that is unfair in a discussion about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:07:27
No this is not the reason.
OP in Australia demand is higher. Head over to BitcoinAUS if you want specific to Asutralia questions.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:26:28
So in the same post you have said:
1. Blockchain has limited uses outside of moving money cheaply
2. Ether serves a purpose for smart contracts
3. Bitcoin will always be valued and is not volatile
I am not sure you even agree with yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:32:10
Or people think that ethereum has a better future than bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:06:22
You are very very lucky that poloniex has stuff built in to save you from literally throwing away your money.
Maybe you should stop buying anything until you know a bit more about what you are doing. For example: what is GAS? Why did youbuy GAS and not NEO?
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:01:17
At no point un the last month (and i think ever) has the congestión of ether been anywhere in the universie of bad that is bitcoin. 'congested' ether is about 90% better in cost (not to mention speed) than bitcoin s best day (while processing nearly 3 times as many transactions).
Next time just use ether
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:20:04
Except that Satoshi viewed blcok size upgrades as inevitable.
For LN to be adopted you need a block size update.
Bitcoin core developers say you will need a block size update.
The reason why people say not to is because there was a community split between bitcoin and bitcoin cash. These coins are practically identical except that bitcoin cash has a bigger blocksize. In order for people to claim bitcoin cash is evil bitcoin supporters here need to say that the block size cant change. Its purely political.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:29:12
It might help to say what country you are from.
Many people only have access to exchanges where the price of crypto is 10-15% higher: you pay more but you can sell for more as well.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:52:45
They've done experiments and calculations. Because the only difference between bitcoin cash and bitcoin is blocksize the supporters of bitcoin have to say that any increase is terrible and centralisation etc. So yes, it's purely political: and a good reason why bitcoin has been losing market share so rapidly over the past year (95% to less than 35%)
As an FYI mining is centralised now anyway (ie it's all in China).
Just Google a bunch of stuff if you want technical descriptions.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:34:12
But the lightning network whitepaper literally says that blocksize will need to be increased
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:45:04
Actually a lot of people here talk about it
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:10:39
Most early developers said to increase block size. But it has become such a political minefield that now pepole pretend that developers never said that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:14:46
In this case it is not the reason. 
Fees are very similiar on Australian exchanges compared to overseas exchanges. However on Australian exchanges people are buying at a much higher rate than other exchanges. Think of it this way: On the marketplaces that Australians have access to buy and sell the "equilibrium price" of what they are willing to buy and sell for is much higher than the price on GDAX. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:48:24
To your first point: mining is centralised now and increasing to 2mb wont make a difference. Dont pretend like an increase from 1mb to 2mb now will make anything discernable worse.
To your second point: you are being sarcastic so I will just leave it.
To your third point: I dont think we are going to convince eachother of anything but I disagree.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:38:06
Again. Why don´t you look at the actual blockchains.
Ethereum has less than 10% of the outstanding transactions that bitcoin has while processing over double each day:
Ethereum: 
Bitcoin: 
The average bitcoin fee has not been below $20 for a month: 
Like I said; the worst days of ethereum are magnitudes better than the best days of bitcoin and can be reflected in the grwoth of ethereum v bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:18:12
Good response
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:06:51
I am not too sure about Malaysia.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:01:20
I am not switching the context. The original user said they used bitcoin instead of ethereum for a transfer because they heard ethereum was congested. I said that it is better to check the actual blockchains to see the amount it costs to transfer (as well as how much you need to pay to be able to do it). At no point recently has ethereum been even close to as  fucked" as bitcoin has been.
I agree that ethereum can get congested, however "congested" for ethereum is something that bitcoin can only dream of.
I am not sure why you think ethereum is fucked: I did a transfer today that went through in minutes and was less than a dollar. 
I understand you are probably invested in bitcoin and therefore very emotional: I can read it in your tone. Try to take the emotion out of it and take a look at the blockchains (i provided the links earlier). 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:37:58


Sorry, but I think that you can´t read very well.
Like I say, try to take emotion out of it. You are emotionally invested in bitcoin, I get it. Lot´s of people used alta vista and myspace for ages too. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:22:42
Transaction fees have not been below $20 for over a month. 
There is currently development going on to improve the situation but this has been an issue for many years. The community split (there is now bitcoin cash which is a fork of bitcoin which attempted to fix this issue) and bitcoin is now unusable.
Most people are either; sticking with bitcoin and hoping the issues resolve or choosing a different crypto. Market share for bitcoin has plummetd from 95% of all crypto to the current low of under 35%.
If you want to transfer an amount in the next couple months (maybe much longer) then choose a different crypto: literally every single other crypto is better by a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:17
Ethereum is no more controlled by the ethereum foundation than bitcoin is by core. And if they want to hard fork they need community consensus: like all hard forks.
Fortunately the community of ethereum is a lot more functional than bitcoin: maybe because bitcoin has been such a failure in being able to evolve that othe cryptos know what not to do?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:00:34
I am on my phone so can't find it but I remember reading something about trusting your keys to someone who is drunk etc. And hoping they keep them safe. Coinbase is safe: and if anything happened with coinbase then there would be a crash in the market as it's currently the gateway for new money. If you had your own wallet and something happened with coinbase with its security then the value of whatever is in your wallet would disappear. This is also a separate point.
Unless people have a significant amount of money then keeping it on coinbase is fine. 
Apologies if I misread what you wrote originally in the comparison  
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:42:43
Well the other thing to look at is the total market cap. Ie the smaller the coin the less money needed to keep it rising. And with bitcoin there has to be a fair amount of money coming in just the keep prices at current rates. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:59:04
But that middle man provides a valuable service to consumers
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:26:14
Firstly maximum supply doesnt mean decentralisation: I think you are conflating 2 separate things.
Secondly way to avoid my point on how the bitcoin community is so toxic that it hasnt been able to evolve: the free market is making its mind up and bitcoin is plummeting in value against all of crypto: new people arent going to want to use a currency that cant be used as a currency.
Lastly, there is no hard cap now but most estimates put it at around 110m depending on how scalig solutions go. It´s a risk but one that I am comfortable taking.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:02:01
Unfortunately yes. For the last few years bitcoin has been becoming worse and worse fee wise. Right now that is why people view it as a 'store of value' because there won't be too many of them. As a currency it is practically useless (as you have seen) until further development is done.
Take a look at other cryptos: nearly all have transactions for less than a cent.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:06:14
Well i guess that´s the million dollar question. There are a bunch of coins you can stake; personally I got a bit of NAVcoin to stake and it´s working well; the developers have constant updates, their reddit is very friendly and I don´t need to be online all day to stake. Whether it will moon or not, who knows? There are quite a few options for you to choose; I considered ARK as well
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:32:29
Realistically how many times do you think bitcoin will 10x from here?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:15:16
What is the majority? If you go to a sub that isn't called bitcoin you will find that the majority think soemthing else
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:00:51
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:40
I was responding to your point about how new there is always a new bitcoin to say that bitcoin is actually at a very low level when compared to the rear of crypto. And it's basically unusable during a big rush of money coming in: it will be interesting to see if people buy bitcoin due to its reputation despite everything else.
Agree we got off point, apologies I was just continuing the discussion that ended up going somewhere else. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:11:02
Lightning is how far away?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:09
This is a very poor explanation.
Proof of stake has many advantages over POW. Just take a look at the power usage of POW compared to POS.
 is a good place to start, some coins that use proof of stake or a type of proof of stake are NAV (I personally stake this coin) and ARK.  Ethereum is also planning on moving to proof of stake.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:51:51
In short: no it is not possible.
Unfortunately bitcoin isn't great as a currency ATM (work is being done) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:17:08
Well it's your fault for using bitcoin to make a transfer. Bitcoin is unusable: next time use a crypto that works.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:42
No worries. Yeah pretty much every other coin is almost instantaneous when transferring however but are receiving no usage (with the exception of ethereum which is currenrly processing about double what bitcoin is processing but also having issues ATM) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:16
I would have thought people would use a privacy coin that can't be tracked if they wanted to buy drugs - ie not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:56:55
How confident are you that lightning network will be usable within 6 months? Bitcoin is I'm a death spiral just as normies are coming in: it's about to hit an all time low for market cap compared to all of crypto.
Let's just wait and see 6 months from now what works. I'm obviously more confident on ethereum, you are in bitcoin so we can just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:38:28
You would still get these probkems: anything over a couple cents is a rip off
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:45:30
I trust them more than I trust bitcoin.
Bitcoin is currently in a death spiral: 270k+ unconfirmed transactions and the average cost just hit $40+. Lightning netowrk isnt going to come any time soon and newbie money is pouring in: I understand you are emotionally and financially invested in bitcoin but surely you can see something is broken?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:19
To answer all of your questions I would say that you should look into a hardware wallet; they are easy to find by googling.
Cold storage refers to a specific way that you set up the wallet and is not what you described.
An advantage of using a hardware wallet is that you will save money on transactions as it seems like the way you described involves many transactions. Unfortunately atm Bitcoin isn´t the best crypto for transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:25
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:22:53
Ok, so bitcoin becomes unusably bad because it cant handle the transaction load being put through it, it becomes more expensive, people then complain about it, something that is almost identical but has changed code to solve a short term problem is working and people say it is better.
I think you are looking for a conspiracy theory when it just makes sense. Bitcoin is unusable, people are looking for solutions. Don´t be emotional, just think about it logically: Would you recommend bitcoin to transact with today?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:52
Well bitcoin is losing market share pretty rapidly. January 1 this year it was 95% of crypto market cap. Now it's less than 50%. Also it isn't processing the most transactions either.
If you were a new user of crypto and wanted to transact with it, would you buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:50:27
Most people are currently involved in bitcoin because of its increasing value against regular currency; nothing to do with bitcoin/the technology itself. 
It´s why everyone loves the price memes; what people are saying is that they now have more $USD which is what they ultimately value. But I guess going mainstream means bitcoin minimises its libertarian section.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:24
Why would you have one currency for payments under $1k and another for other payments? Why wouldn't you just use the currency that has the lowest fees for all payments?

You can't afford to invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:13:14
Well some people like basic resistant coins or looking to other protocols like error of stake
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:23:32
They consolidate it. When you buy and bad sell on exchanges you arent interacting with the blockchain at all.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:07
I'm pretty sure bitcoin was always intended as the p2p store of wealth and that he should never have actually used it
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:57
Currently the total amount of money in the world is $60t. If each bitcoin is worth $1m this means that bitcoin will be about 1/3 of total money. Do you really think that is possible?

You sound like a child.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:28
Bitcoin actually doesn't process the most amount of transactions so it isn't the largest by transaction size: ethereum processes over double a day.

Yeah it is a bunch of nonsense.

Not sure if you are serious. 
But you do know that when you purchase a soda with a $100 bill you are using the same currency as if you purchased it with any other bill of that currency. It's the same currency whether it's a 10 or 20 or 50 or whatever bill.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:43:06
The spike you are referring to was when Bitcoin had a huge jump the other week: because price is linked to satoshi it means that the bump would have reflected the btc increase.
You can blame the fork if you like but that seems a bit silly. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:07:52
Yes you're right, sorry I was wrong. 
I was responding to the fud you were spreading about your description of coinbase. Most new users will lose their small investment in traction fees on bitcoin by transferring off coinbase which is actually very safe - not how you described it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:47
Read my above comment.
You dont want to respond to me on anything I said. I responded to you above. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:14:22
Not compared to BTC &amp; BCH. Take a look at other crypto reddits just as an example. 
The funny thing about BTC &amp; BCH fighitng is that they are almost identical technically. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:41:24
Yeah I hope it is a slow decline: bitcoin will still have holders but until it fixes it's issues (lighting is still a whole away) I don't see how it can hold onto it's lead. It just isn't a very good product.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:31:52
What's nonsense? Bitcoin and all its forks together don't process as much as ethereum.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:58:38
I think maybe it is worth re looking at how much money is actually needed to move bitcoins price. There is actually only a small proportion of bitcoin that is being sold and bought as a proportion of total bitxoin. This is due to many lost wallets, holders etc. 
However the total market cap is calculated by saying that all currently 16m+ coins have the same value. This is technically true but the price is being moved by the trading of the few bitcoins that are actually being traded. Saying that tether is only a small percentage of overall bitcoin market cap is therefore misleading when it is being used to influence the price of the few bitcoins that are actually being traded.
You could argue that the overall market cap of bitcoin is inflated by coins that will never be used (which doesn't necessarily mean the price of the individual coins is less)
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:37:14
Do transfer with a different currency like ether then transfer to btc. 
Btc is rapidly losing market share and value against all other crypto so it's just a matter of time before it stops being the standard while trading.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:29
I wasn't arguing with you
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:02
Ethereum for one.
I would also say that until Bitcoin mining becomes ASIC resistant it isn´t decentralised.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:41:19
I thought GDAX was free for transfers? Also for such a small amount it probably isn´t worth transferring: You will lose both when transferring and if you ever transfer ack.

Unfortunately fees right now are ~$20 to use the bitcoin network
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:26:37
Exactly: all these people saying bitcoin isn't useful as a currency are ignoring how 'extremely viable' it is for merchants selling goods over $250 and willing to wait over a day
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:21
Maybe if segwit is ever adopted then it could be a difference. 
The fact is that the bitcoin community is completely fragmented atm: not just bitcoin cash v bitcoin but the fact most of the mining is done out of China, the developers are driving ahead on things without consulting the businesses thatvwant to use bitcoin (which is why bitcoin usage is ay an all time low) and the new users to bitcoin would probably be wondering why anybody would use a currency with transaction fees in the $20s.
A ton of non bitcoin currencies are coming up and the question is whether they will take over while bitcoin and bitcoin chas argue over minor differences
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:36:49
I think we are now talking about different things. 
I understand coinbase charge a premium for being the entry point and most user friendly crypto buying site. 
Secondly I don´t think I am spreading disinformation when replying to someone who is asking if $20 is a normal transaction price that yes, it is currently a normal transaction price. The reason it is not disinformation is because the current average price is above $20 and has been increasing over time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:48
Agree, you had never seen the mempool before I linked you and think that bitcoins problems are a conspiracy theory.
I think something else: I guess we will agree to disagree on who has their eyes open.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:52:02
My point is that you are saying you dont know what you are doing and still making money. Thats because the market we are in is that almost everything is going up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:46:41
The trading volume doesn´t directly impact the network: that´s the amount of bitcoin traded on exchanges.
Bitcoin can currently only process about 3-400k transactions a day and has had uncomfirmed transactions of 100k+ for a while now (last week it was 200k+)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:27
What were your fees and confirmation times?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:22
its all game theory. 
how about we leave it at is. i understand that right now im at an advantage (ie bitcoin costs are now about $40 - remember when people were fighting over them reaching 10 cents? and there are almost 300k unconfirmed transactions, all the noobs who bought bitcoin are wondering why anyone would use something that i broken etc etc etc), so lets just agree to disagree over benefits of ethereum and bitcoin and look again in 6 months. 
maybe bitcoins continued failure means people get turned off al crypto? who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:59
it´s spelt ethereum.
And yeah, the problem is that there are so many people who are invested in bitcoin financially that they view any other technology as superceding it as an attack. In a way it is an attack in the same way that facebook was an attack on myspace. Imagine if people had invested a bunch of money into myspace and the continued success of myspace was reliant on more and more people signing up to myspace? It seems like that is what is happening now.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:02
I'm not shilling - I think what you would want to accuse me of is spreading fud (I'm not), it seems like you don't really know the terms very well. 
I took a look at your comment history and it seems like you are someone who wants to pretend bitcoin doesn't have a problem with transaction costs. That's fine, good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:49
With almost 200k unconfirmed transactions it will be interesting to see what happens when these hit exchanges - any guesses?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:02:51
Years ago this sort of thinking would have represented bitcoin but nowadays bitxoin is actually about gaining more fiat: that's what mainstream adoption means

Nope. Their USD is covered under FDIC for us citizens but their crypto is also separately insured. 
I googled coinbase insurance but unlike you I read the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:55
Basically bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin when the community had a fight over a technical detial.
Last night the fork was added to an exchange and everyone here thinks that it is an attack on bitcoin. It is difficult to see through it bit basically everyone here is very emotional: they have money invested in "bitcoin" so if there are more competitors that ezist then maybe they will lose money because people will buy other coins
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:09:37
Unfortunately with bitcoin what happened was that people made computers that are very very good at only doing bitcoin calculations. Then they mass produced them and now most mining comes from these massive computer farms in China.
If you want to mine a coin you can but you just need to look for asic resistant coins (ie they can't build a computer to do the specific calculation). Google asic resistant and you should find them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:27:42
Proof of stake is much more efficient energy wise and avoids centralisation of mining (which is a big problem with btc right now).

Coinbase doesn't sell you shit. Coinbase matches you up with someone else who buys it off you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:18:19
I saw it and I saw your comment history where you claimed to send transactions at little cost but refused to provide any proof. Like I said, good luck.

Why is it so personal? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:59:53
The only thing BTC has going for it is network effect and name recognition (which is a very big thing); it is slow, cumbersome and the developor community is quite divided and prone to infighting over minor issues. However, because Bitcoin is Bitcoin and has name recognition it is still pretty much set. There are many "copies" of Bitcoin that exist were they have changed something that could be seen as an improvement however they do not have the same name recognition (i.e Litecoin, NAV, Vertcoin etc). 
Ethereum itself is completely different: it doesn´t want to just be a currency (Bitcoin has changed its definition from "currency" to "store of value" as it became unusable as a currency) and allows people to write contracts onto the blockchain. This allows people to do a bunch of cool stuff (look up crptokitties for example). It is currently processing about double the amount of transactions at a fraction of the cost of Bitcoin however is still experiencing scaling issues as well. I´m a fan of Ethereum; go take a look at the Ethereum subreddit and compare it to here and you will see the difference.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:05:38
When you say same level of use, what do you mean?
Ethereum processes over double the amount of transactions as bitcoin at a fraction of the cost.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:30
Btc doesn't work for buying stuff - maybe this crash is all the newbies that caused the rise realising that bitcoin is broken.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:05:13
Because they eat the fees.
Literally try and do a transaction from your own wallet. Using bitcoin costs a lot of money because the network is congested.
Try to use the network now and tell me how much it costs to get a transaction through in the next hour? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:39
Currently 200k transactions outstanding with maximum hashpower supporting them. There is a fair bit of irony that when bitcoin has never been performing worse as a currency it is reaching all time highs and peoppe literally don't care.
Is the point of bitcoin to increase so you can sell for more fiat or is bitcoin a peer to peer currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:04
Ok, so bitcoin becomes unusably bad because it cant handle the transaction load being put through it, it becomes more expensive, people then complain about it, something that is almost identical but has changed code to solve a short term problem is working and people say it is better.
I think you are looking for a conspiracy theory when it just makes sense. Bitcoin is unusable, people are looking for solutions. Don´t be emotional, just think about it logically: Would you recommend bitcoin to transact with today?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:52
Well to be honest it's happening now. January 1 this year bitcoin was 95% of the crypto market cap. Right now it's less than half and dropping. It's why people here are so emotional: they have invested money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:46:55
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:30
Maybe for you americans its spelled, but for us australians spelts is fine :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:42:01
I think that you need to try and take your emotions out of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:28:30
Or maybe they are using crypto technology for something completely unrelated to money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:32
Do you only accept bitcoin or would you accept another crypto?

Cough cough current flavour of the month on reddit that hasn't shown it can process anything
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:55:23
Except that with bitcoin the value of it fluctuates a lot over that month. My point is that if people wanted to use a decentralised currency to make payment they would use a usable one and not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:48:35
As long as you put the right address you should be fine. With an exchange you are actually waiting on two things: firstly for coinbase to send the transaction and secondly for bitcoin itself to be transferred. Unfortunately (and I'll probably receive down votes for saying so here) bitcoin is very congested, so and expensive. Ironically the worse it gets the higher the price. Yull just have to wait
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:33:42
Nope, don't own and have never owned bitcoin cash. - check my comment history. It makes sense that you would attack me though: the bitcoin community is like what MySpace would have been if everyone had put money into it: they would have viewed technological superiority as an attavk because they were so financially, and therefore emotionally, invested. I get it: everything is a big conspiracy against poor bitcoin.
Lighting network has been coming for a very long time and it's arguable whether it will come in time to save bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:44:50
Thats not true. Fees have been an issue for a very long time: the whoel reason the community split was because of them
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:19:38
If you want real world applications look at other cryptos- this is a bitcoin Reddit wjere people only care about more fiat
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:36:08
Right now the mining algorithms are basically the same and the mining companies can switch between coins and both coins are equally at the mercy of them. To say that one is worse than the other is misleading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:41
Yeah but atm segwit adoption is v low (which is a separate discussion). I was responding here to someone who said the reason bitcoin cash was bad was because the mining was centralised in China - if that makes bitcoin cash bad then it makes bitcoin bad as well
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:13:55
Yes that's how much it costs: why do you think bitcoin has been falling so rapidly against all other crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:08:04
Except that couldn't the same argument you made be made for using straight cash?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:29:06
1. When the mining is done it isn´t an either/or. It is together
2. A couple companies in China have built computers that specialise in solving the Bitcoin problems. These computers control a very large proportion of total mining power (well over 50%). This is one point of difference between Bitcoin and other coins that advertise themselves as "ASIC resistant". If a coin is ASIC resistant you can´t build specialised computer chips to solve them and therefore can´t centralise the mining power like has been done with Bitcoin. This means that anybody with a single computer can not make a difference in processing these transactions; you just don´t have the computer power.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:32:23
Agree to disagree on the incentives involved in what the ethereum foundation can and cant do.
You arent responding to anything that I am saying about bitcoin so I assume that you agree with me on those points. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:17
I think you are looking for an explanation that says the reason bitcoin has fees that are multiples higher than any other crypto, is incredibly slow and is losing market share are because there is an "attack".
It could just be that bitcoin is unusable and any new money coming in (which doesnt have an alliegance or emotional attachment) is going to choose something that works. Because unfortunately right now bitcoin does not work.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:19:18
Or people will move to cryptos that are mcuh further along scalability wise. Though who knows what will happen, hopefully everything keeps on going up indefinitely 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:30:08
Except that the foundation has been clear in what max supply will be. They are incentivised to work with the community: honestly take a look at the ethereum reddit and tell me if you think the quality of the community is better or worse than this one?
In this one everyone screams conspiracy theory if bitcoin dips in price.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:40:57
My understanding of these cards is you arent actually paying with crypto. You are buying the currency you are paying with then making a payment like a normal debit / credit payment.
In effect they aren't actually crypto cards but cards that facilitate the sale of crypto to fiat to merchant. I could be wrong on some of those cards as I haven't looked into them specifically
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:25
Is anyone worried that bitcoin is at risk of becoming unusable?
Right now there is a record high of unconfirmed transactions, a record high cost for performing these transactions and a very high level of hash power supporting them.
Considering that mining cimpanies in China control pretty much all the mining power for Bitcoin, what happens if they decide to go with Bitcoin Cash?
The irony is that Bitcoin has never had a higher price but has never been more unusable as a currency. Maybe this has something to do with there being a large demand but also an inability to transfer bitcoin to be able to sell it (artificially reducing the supply). Just look at all the comments here from people asking about transactions and how long they are taking. 
Unconfirmed transactions: 
Cost per transaction: 
What happens if the lightning network doesn´t come in time?
edit: added links
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:14:30
They don't tax bitcoin per se but the profits you make off bitcoin. So if you transfer back to whatever currency (assuming at a higher rate) you will probably be using an exchange that sends info to the IRS. 
Additionally bitcoin is not anonymous - you would need to look into other cryptos if you highly value anonymity when transacting as apposed to store of value
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:43
The only thing peoppe want to use bitcoin for is buying more fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:02:28
Those are the bitcoin fees to use the network. If you dont have too much bitcoin you should leave it on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:16
Have you looked at any other crypto currencies?
It seems like you say "crypto market" when you actually just mean bitcoin. 
Do you know that bitcoin does not process even more than half of total crypto transactions and has fees that are more than 20x any other crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:58
Ethereum*, and Ethereum is doing over double the transactions at a fraction of the cost.
Bitcoin has been around the longest: technically other blockchains that are very very similiar (i.e forks of bitcoin) that made minor changes could process more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:23:45
It's an exchange that facilitates buying and selling. Someone was willing to buy and someone was willing to sell
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:10:16
I don't understand. The average cost to use the network is currently over $20:  I don't know why I'm being down voted or accused of spreading disinformation (or I know why I just think it's wrong.). 
If people don't have too much invested in bitcoin (ie less than $100) it really isn't currently worth transferring off the exchanges because they will, on average, lose 20% of their bitcoin to currently transfer it. Telling people otherwise only means we get inundated with 'i transfered $50 but now I only have $30 what did I do wrong?' questions.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:15:11
You are wrong. Every crypto to anything is a capital gains event (if you are from the us)
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:09:25
That's not true that fees were a non issue. Why do you think there has been so much infighting?
Network problems have been an issue for longer than 7 months.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:15:44
Ah ok, apologies I assumes you meant bitcoin cash from the block size reference.
Block size will go up: the irony about the fallout in bitcoin core is that lightning network relies on blockaize increase. And ethereum is processing over half of all crypto transactions at a fraction of the cost of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:46:53
How many people currently involved in bitcoin are hardcore libertarian/anarcho-capitalist types?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:46:20
You can check the average fee size over time here:
You can also compare fees to other coins
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:54
Thats literally every crypto including bitcoin.
Users rely on miners responding to economic incentives to process transactions. All of crypto is based on game theory.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:51:31
I wasn't talking about bitcoin cash : the argument peoppe are having over minor technical differences is pretty funny when there are other blockvhains with vastly superior technology processing many many more transactions (over double of all bitcoin and bitcoin forks combined) : ethereum
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:07:29
This is one of the reasons why people say bitcoin is now centralised: because the mining pools are centralised.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:51:01
Well I guess we will see what happens over time. Bitcoin is decreasing in market share more and more and is close to lowest point compared to all of crypto. But yes for now the single feature people have for bitcoin is that it can be sold for more moment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:12:58
True fees were lower in the past but still a major cause of infighting. To say that fees have become an issue only with all this new interest isn't true- bitcoin. Has been struggling with scalability for years.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:44:46
Take a looka t other reddits: EG cryptocurrency is a more general crypto reddit. Ethereum is the next biggest coin and if you take a look at the ethereum reddit compared to this one the conversation is a lot different.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:33
I´ll reply to you here as well, this is a better view of the mempool: 
The fees are increasing slowly over time as the proportion of transactions that are high are added, and the proportion of transactions that are cheaper (ie were acceptable in the past) are reduced. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:44
Yes fees are this high - average cost to use network is currently above $20
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:26:04
The technology is broken with record high unconfirmed transactions, record high fees, record low usage for its original purpose, community infighting over small technical details etc etc. 
6 months ago bitcoin was worth how much? And why would it be worth more than that now?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:40:27
"i dont know much about it"
Proof we are in a market where its almost impossible not to make money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:09:32
Honestly it isn't worth it to transfer if it's only a couple hundred. Leave it on the exchange. 
Think of it this way: if coinbase gets hacked and you have your money in your wallet the value of what you have will most likely crash anyway and the cost to use the network will be so high that you wouldn't be able to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:59
What's the lowest point of bitcoin today compared to 1 month ago? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:09:21
Though also with $1000 you don´t really make that much staking; think of it as interest on a bank account. The swings of crypto positive or negative will vastly outweigh any gains from staking
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:16
When? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:14
The community literally split over an argument about how to handle fees. It has neot been a "basically" non-issue for years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:52
It's way too late for that. A small amount of people own a large proportion of bitcoin: it's what keeps the price up and is that same across nearly all crypto coins
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:54:12
All good: because saying bitcoin has no utility is true. But saying blockchain has no utility isn't true.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:51:38
Maybe this is the reason why BTC market share is dropping: It is currently less than 50%.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:37:09
Bitcoin has been very clogged for a while - people were complaining years ago tgat fees were too high. High fees and lack of usability have been issues all the way through this year - and it hasn't affected the price at all. Quite the opposite, the worse bitcoin gets the higher the price.
Though judging by the amount of comments here from people buying for first time and complaining about losing a good portion of their investment to fees I wouldn't consider them 'weak hands' if they instead chose a different crypto until bitcoin sorts itself out.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:08:11
If there were no normies do you think the price would have risen?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:05:14
Except that coin base is insured so you don't know  what you're talking about. If it s a small amount it's fine leaving it on coinbase otherwise it will get eaten by fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:10
Doesn't stop you crying conspiracy
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:16:30
Or even smarter they would just keep using fiat and not worry about a non existent problem
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:05
Ethereum is no more controlled by the ethereum foundation than bitcoin is by core. And if they want to hard fork they need community consensus: like all hard forks.
Fortunately the community of ethereum is a lot more functional than bitcoin: maybe because bitcoin has been such a failure in being able to evolve that othe cryptos know what not to do?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:32
You guys would be about 16-17 right?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:10:42

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:19:19
It's not - bitxoin cash and bitcoin are basically identical technically. The funny thing is that most times groups have in fighting is over really minor differences: think religion.
Just have a read of all the comments in this thread talking about attacks and evil people and blah blah blah. It's funny to read.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:00
Look weve talked enough so ill leave it here.
its all game theory: like miners pushing for increased blocksize to aleviate some scaling issues, like coinbase listing bitcoin cash, like people choosing a workable coin instead of the "myspace/yahoo" of coins. i cbf continuing this, catch ya later.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:31
Why? What determines the value of bitcoin? 6 months ago peoppe would have said this price was crazily high
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:09:47
Crypto is a lot more than bitcoin infighting between BTC &amp; BCH
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:09:45
The problem is that bitcoin right now is broken. It has fees that are more than 20x times any other coin and isn't processing that many transactions.
There is a lot of new money coming in and the question is: if you were new money what would you buy? The broken and expensive bitcoin or another coin?
So people here who have invested in bitcoin view any other coin (especially one that wants to call itself the "true" bitcoin) as an attack. They say everything bad that happens is an attack, that it's all collusion and a conspiracy against them etc. 
Have a read of these comments. Then go over to another coins reddit (ie ethereum which processes over double the transactions at a fraction of the cost) and tell me which community you would want to join
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:26
You should volunteer your time to bitcoin core: you seem to have a real grasp of the issues
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:57:21
Yes agree that nothing is ready for Amazon.
I think the solution would be something where people don´t even realise they are using crypto.
I think that LN is the current "but no its not a bubble" line. Maybe it will come and work, maybe it wont but I dont think its the certainty people are making it out to be.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:45:53
Fair enough: I guess you kinda proved my point. You paid for a laptop and then paid extra (probably high double figures, maybe triple figures) to be able to say you paid with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:19:15
Except that ethereum is processing over doble the transactions of bitcoin so thats not true
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:27:36
Yes I can read the charts. There are 165k unconfirmed transactions currently. And the current average transaction fee is over $20: 
There are lots of new people here so I think this dishonest to say the reason someone is paying $20+ to do a transfer is because if coinbase where the average cost is currently above $20 and there are 265k unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:58:30
Can you always sell at a 50% loss?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:14
Atm none: bitcoin is being used less and less and less by businesses
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:12
ethereum isnt a fork
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:08:16
IOTA is not be ready and also the point of IOTA has absolutely nothing to do with payments. Again with Byteball and ripple: you are talking about coins which have a purpose and amazon/ebay just co opting them. They should look at crypto that actually wants to be used as a currency. Unfortunately Bitcoin (atm) can´t perform this function so maybe litecoin, vertoin, dash etc. Or more likely they would use another service that "transfers" crypto into fiat at point of purchase and then makes the payment.
Yes, maybe in perpetually 18 months away they can use LN.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:13
What are you talking about? Bitcoin currently has over 50% of mining from a couple colluding companies in China.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:22
Changes in hash difficulty and miners moving between bitcoins.
None of that changes the fact htat bitcoin has been operating with almost total hash power and has still been deteorating.
I dont think bitcoin cash is the future either.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:56:05
No worries. The other thing with bitcoin is how much supply there actually is. For example while there are currently almost 17m coins a fair chunk of them are lost. Additionally a large proportion of them are sitting in wallets of people who have never used them. This means that the "total market cap" figure is actually a reflection of the price of the limited coins that are currently being traded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:01
Or there are other cryptos that have other solutions. 
Crypto is bigger than bitcoin v bitcoin cash. I.e ethereum is processing over double the transactions that bitcoin and bitcoin cash are doing together
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:08:47
Disagree, but sure
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:46:01
Consider that you will have to transfer back from your wallet if you ever want to sell.
It's best to leave your money on coinbase if you have less than $1k.
People will say that if coinvase is hacked you lose your money: but if coinbase is hacked there will be such a crash in the market that your bitcoin wont be worth all that much and during this time fees would skyrocket (even higher than their current average of $50)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:28
Who is ready for the vegeta memes again?
Even though I'm losing money it's hard not to feel a little like sanity has taken over with these dropping prices: broken technology perpetually increasing in price as it became more and more unusable just didn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:14:00
It's hard to say. Fees are so high and have been increasing consistently for such a long time (of the cryptos I hold I have less that 5% in bitcoin) with lightning network perpetually "soon" that I reckon above couple $1000 would be ok for coinbase. But that's me, I know other people would say that a couple thousand on an exchange is crazy
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:16:26
$20 is low?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:01:22
I think you´re delusional. The fee problem is one that has built up over time.
The irony is that Bitcoin Cash is pretty much identical to Bitcoin in almost every single way. 
What is happening now is that more and more people are needing to pay more and more to get transactions processed. The newer transactions are coming in at a higher cost than the transactions of 2 weeks ago (which are falling out of the mempool). This means that things are bad and getting worse: 
The question is whether people choose to keep the faith with bitcoin as it gets worse and worse, move to other crypto or leave the space entirely. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:02:53
It's not an attack. The men pool has been building over time.
What it actually is that bitcoin hasnt been able to make any improvements to scaling; there are other blockvhains capable of processing more transactions. In fact right now ethereum is processing 2.5 times more transactions for a fraction of the cost
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:40
Honest question: why?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:39:20
"only 60x from now" is a lot. 99% of people currently getting into Bitcoin are doing it to make more USD: they don´t actually care about Bitcoin, they care about USD. If the value of Bitcoin was $1m per coin it would actually mean that the USD has crashed.
Bitcoin itself is useless as a currency and is why people say it is a "store of value"; it is slow, expensive and less businesses than ever are using it. However it is increasing dramatically in price and the question is can people keep investing into it faster than other people find their "I have enough USD" point and sell out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:10:52
Take a look at other cryptos if you want utility. Bitxoin is supposed to do one thing (trust less p2p currency) and when it stopped doing that it became store of value. It hasn't tries to do complicated things.
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:06:10
So your plan for bitcoin is that it is just a vehicle to accumulate more dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:39:47
well you can start here: 
Ethereum is looking to move to proof of stake. It seems like it would be possible for bitcoin to move to proof of stake from a technical perspective (eg NAVCoin, which is based on Bitcoin is proof of stake), however I wouldnt think that it is possible based on the current idealogy around bitcoin (i.e bitcoin cant even make simple technological progress without there being a great deal of controversy).
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:31:15
this is one reason why i like proof of stake
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:24:38
All good. 
Just a funny comment that you would criticise any European countrys economic policy when the usa is doing a pretty good attempt at making sure it won't be the world's leading economy for too long
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:11:54
Except that according to even the overly optimistic economic growth estimates put forward by the white house the deficit is expected to grow. 
So no. The reason that many European and Scandinavian countries can afford higher government spending is because they tax so much. The USA is moving toeards high spending low tax.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:19:39
Except that Scandinavian countries are in Europe and are usually the ones peoppe accuse of being socialist. Because they have such generous social welfare and high taxes. 
The USA though: an example of what happens when people get to power who lack the courage to govern. Nothing to do with capitalism or socialism, just a bunch of people who are lowering taxes and increasing spending while increasing deficits. Remember when deficits were bad? Only when you are in opposition.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:28:27
Maybe the states will ahve to impose higher taxes to keep up with their increased spending?
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:34:31
