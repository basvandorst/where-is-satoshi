I lost around USD 600 so far. 
My actions for buying back were in order to decrease losses/make profits, because I expected the price to go up again. Unfortunately I couldn't predict the market correcty. 
The selling at a low price happened because I wanted to minimize losses. It didn't work. I maximized them. 
Someone was asking about my strategy. 
My strategy was to invest longterm and also make advantages and small arbitrage in day-trading with stops limits (I made USD 20 in daytrading before the mtgox crash and after that lost USD 600 because the market was to volatile and made the wrong actions).
I mean maybe I could have reduced my losses and won back the money, if I would have been lucky. But I cannot predict the future of the charts :'( I'm not god.
Do you have any advices for me? What could I do better? How do I predict the market more correctly? Which actions should I take to win back my losses or even make profit?
Thanks for all the answers,
xoxo Jacqueline

Is there somewhere a post in order to understand the bitcoin market more and do better decisions and to get the important news?
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:42:35
But who is the postal service in this case? the Bitcoin currency in general? So does it have a major flaw??

How can I see a downtrend?
Do/Did you guys all hold during the mtgox crisis?

Thanks. Very helpful :) Now I understand

But to my defense, the price was quite stable for over a month when I bought it, it got more and more accepted, so I thought it would rise.

I had actually one course in school about that, but I didn't listen so carefully. All I remember is that old prof said if you loose-&gt;hold till it goes up and diversify. 
Diversification: 
Basically all the other cryptocurrencies are not accepted anywhere and some I read where premined (Nxt, quark) or are shortlived ... . 
But anyway I also bought 7 LTC and for USD 30 Kittehcoins.
Hold till it goes up:
I thought I'm more clever than that old teacher, so I tried to minimize losses, to sell at the falling but still expensive price and to buy back cheap (I didn't do the second part, I bought back expensive).

But litecoin is nowhere accepted as a payment, so it seems worthless. And I read Quark and Nxt were premined, so it doesn't seem like a good option.

So basically mtgox wasn't scamming and it's just a matter of time till it gets fixed and the prices rise?

So only the Wallets and MtGox tracking system have flaws?

May I ask: When the price is falling, it means that Bitcoins are cheap then, right? How do you know if it has fallen enough or will fall even more?  At which point is the best to buy? What are the expectations forthe bitcoin price in the next months or till the end of the year?

Yes, but what about the other Cryptocurrencies?
