How do I cancel an unconfirmed transaction? I think I fucked up the fee and it's been pending for 2 days.

It's a common assumption that he's dead. He's never touched any of all the numerous wallets believed to be his. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:12
just transfer it around in wallets not connected to the sites. buy at one place, cash out, transfer it, then sell it to another.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:42:29
probably, just like people still send bitcoin to the genesis wallet even though it will never be spent.

Litecoin is bitcoins silver.

prove you got 500 bitcoins?

The fact that bch had the bitcoin.com domain and twitter handle has a lot to do with fueling the deception also.

People will write this stuff until bitcoin is 1 cent again. Still up 100% !
It means jackshit when almost everyone except a lucky few invested around the $600 to $1000 mark.

[Has it ever been more appropriate?](
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:13:46
For what purpose? I'm not the one making the grandiose claim to be putting 500 bitcoins in cold storage for a year.

The general consensus is that Satoshi is dead. There are lots of early addresses known to be his that have never been touched.

You realise how many people got scammed by bitconnect right? People really do need to be told that point.

Crypto is an unregulated market. It's not like the stockmarket. Whales are doing loads of shady shit behind the scenes to manipulate prices in crypto that would be totally illegal in the stockmarket.

There's a tool for spoofing play online. I remember It was around 10 or 15 years ago. You had to write your own code, and obviously no one was giving away winning code for free, but it was fairly easy to set up and get it playing in a real game. 
I can only imagine how much easier it's gotten in the last 15 years. My guess is that pokerstars is full of these bots playing lowish stakes all day. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:23:21
I hope that your gamble pays off. I can think of a few better ways to invest 36k than gambling on crypto. No new money is coming into crypto and whales seem to have got bored. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:45:12
I'll just echo previous thoughts here that it's an extremely bad idea to advertise that you have bitcoin in any way. Some people will smash you over the head with a wrench for $10.

Yea, hindsight is 20/20

When solar power was first becoming popular the power grid paid decent prices for your excess electricity. Now they pay peanuts because they know they can.

Eh, bitcoin is the least centralised crypto. The creators are dead. Most, if not all other cryptos have foundation holders and who knows what else, ready to manipulate the market. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:26:47
Yea the audible "you can't see me, I'm a shadow" made it terribly fake to me.

I think that he's inferring that every crypto is a shitcoin except bitcoin but even then no one really knows where bitcoin is going to bottom out. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:36:52
I agree. So many bullshit stories here. Bought a house but don't remember the cash out price? People just want to look smart.

I always thought that the plural of bitcoin is bitcoin.

Yea I think pretty much only the US uses that format.

Bitcoins distribution mirrors traditional wealth then. 90% of traditional wealth is owned by 10% of a population. Bitcoin isnt a Robin Hood scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:51:07
This guy is one jammy dodger. He doesn't get his original buy price, then the price tanks and he gets almost double the bitcoins as an apology. the next day the price goes back up. Roughly doubled his invested in 2 days.

The difficulty adjusts to the network speed. Regardless of how fast the network is, it takes roughly 10 minutes.

He took completely random bets with the chance of winning at 49.5%? Sorry but hes just stupid. I play poker and blackjack but at least I know when I lose it had something to do with me. Personally never understood gambling on complete random chance.

Of course mining is eventually profitable if you dont pay for the electricity.

Not sure why you're downvoted. This is spot on. Fiat is valuable because governments say so. Traditional "sound-money" is precious metals such as gold and silver that derive their value from free market demand(Of course governments somewhat intervene but not entirely like fiat). Bitcoin is also sound money, its value is based on free market demand.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:58:53
agreed, although at this point I can never see bitcoins hitting $0 unless some exploit is found rendering it worthless.

They dont allow any app to make or exchange money without them getting a slice. Similar reason as to why they shut down the Kindle in app purchases (I dont know if thats back now)

Don't day trade bitcoins. The swings are even less predictable than traditional forex markets where 99% of independant traders lose money.
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:28:58
Wow. I do actually feel bad for you. You dont really know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:24:52
You should be able to get the IP address of the buyer from localbitcoins with a legal request. Take it from there. Even though bank transfers are supposed to be the most irreversible way of sending funds to someone, its still possible to claim fraud. For this reason I dont think i could part with more than 1 bitcoin per buyer except face-to-face to be honest.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:05:04
Once bitcoin has a "killer app", allowing the average person to use bitcoin extremely easily, I think the popularity will explode. Until then its going to continue to be kinda a niche idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:34:29
Why not? Because android is an open and insecure platform.

The most common gold bars that you probably thinking of weight 400 (troy) ounce of gold. Gold weighs more than silver comparatively speaking, so if you've ever seen a silver 1 oz coin, then a 1 oz gold coin is even smaller than that.

A lot, bots sweep these wallets every minute of the day. All the easy pickings are gone by now though.

Its almost as if the OP is lying for sympathy tips. Hmmmmm.
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:29:20
You do realise that spending $20,000 on bitcoins would have been a better investment, right?
At current bitcoin prices and the ever increasing difficulty that means that miner will never have a positive ROI. Even if bitcoin prices hypothetically skyrocket again, the ROI will still be no where near as good as having bought $20,000 of bitcoins.
I'm just hoping you're rich and bought this as a hobbyist project and not as a serious investment.

Why do you need almost $10,000 in an android wallet? What did you intend to buy with it for "everyday use" (as you put it)?
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:28:33
if could optimise the process I think you'd make a killing by selling these. Not just for bitcoin addresses. People want QR codes for everything.

China is involved now, big time. All bets on this being a bubble are off.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:33:18
China wasnt involved heavily like they are now. This is likely not a bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:21:35
Even if the electricity is free there is no ROI.  That person is just much better off buying bitcoins directly rather than blades. The only reason to mine is to keep bitcoins alive and for hobbyist reasons. Anyone wanting to invest should just buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:40:29
Isn't that true for most investments?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:24:52
The majority of bitcoins are probably held by very few people. They're likely to be dumping off some coins at what they consider to be a good sell price.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:56:12

@_date: 2013-12-01 12:57:22
that story almost made my stomach turn, what an idiot. Then again he never provided the address so IMO the whole story could be a lie.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:04:50
yes it can become easier (look at historical difficulty) but the time to mine will still remain roughly the same.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:52:12
My guess is that 99% of people who were not early adopters (pre $1000) will lose money in bitcoin. Similar to forex but even less predictable.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:08:28
you would devalue it by taking it out of the package. Sealed PAMP bars carry a certain premium price.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:44:30
keep most of your bitcoins in a secure offline encrypted wallet. You can have as many wallets as you want. You can keep a little bit of bitcoin on android but only something you'd want to spend that day or week.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:52:36
This is the problem with an unregulated market.
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:26:47
Yea, I feel bad for this guy. If he just invested directly in bitcoin instead of pre-ordering this miner he would have $100,000 by now.
