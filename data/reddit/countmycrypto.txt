If you search Airbitz.co for Bitcoin-accepting businesses in London ( you'll see there are a few (probably Cex is one of the best-known), and most of them are based very near where we're planning the pop-up shop to be. We're also working actively with a couple of businesses in the area (one of them a chain) to help them adopt Bitcoin payments, and will be posting an update on the Indiegogo campaign page with a report from the evening we are doing with them. 
I buy coffee and drinks once or twice a week at venues locally using my Bitcoin wallet, and the other businesses we have talked to are very interested in starting to accept BTC - they just need the practical help we are going to provide.

Yes, correct - the 16.9% would be for perks... we've allowed just £2,000 for the XBT float for exactly the reason you've outlined above (we'd assumed Circle's model would work). I know that £80,000 sounds like a lot. If we were going for a simple app and back end that we were going to use for activating the cards ourselves or by a small number of vendors, then we would develop these ourselves in the same way we developed Count My Crypto, and development costs would be virtually 0, assuming we did not draw a salary. 
The issue is that we are aiming to be in major retail chains and in order to integrate with the existing point-of-sale card activation systems, we would need specialist development and testing that is beyond our combined skillset as we would have to provide proof of resilience and security that something smaller-scale would not necessarily need in order to get the major card distribution companies to take us on.  
We are looking at partnering with an existing software house that specialises in card activation. Because we would be looking for short-term help from a number of specialist developers, we'd be paying experienced people contract rates for a limited timespan rather than taking someone on longer term to try and work with us to do everything. Per-day contract rates in London for this kind of specialist work are high, so are assuming we'd need an Android developer and an iOS developer minimum to finish the app we have prototyped as well as someone experienced in the kind of financial systems mentioned below to do the back end and integration work. In addition to this, we would need extensive performance and security testing as well as full test runs across a wide range of devices and OS, some of which I would pick up myself but some of which would have to be contracted out. When it comes to critical financial transactions, handing out a beta to users for testing simply won't cut it.
We had allowed roughly one year of person-hours at contract rates - London contract rates are high (or average of 3 x developers/tester working for 4 months) plus contingency time plus a percentage for what the card distribution company would take. It sounds like a lot, but I think it's better to be realistic about development/distribution costs. As I said earlier, it's being done through a limited company so all accounts would be available for audit. 
PM me if you want more of a breakdown or to discuss this. Happy you feel that the idea at least is a good one.

If you want to get an idea of the sheer number of coins out there and the amount invested in them,  is a good place to start, or our calculator/tracker tool  Investing in cryptos can be a whole lot of fun - it's just a matter of not getting sucked into the pump 'n' dump schemes. Oh, and never keeping too much of your investment in exchanges or in online wallets.

The  team are based in Shoreditch... gonna pop along tomorrow and have a look. Also saw a new user account pop up on Twitter today claiming a Dogecoin cafe's starting up somewhere in London too

The QR code on the back of the hanger is purely for illustration purposes so the user knows what to expect, and so the code on the back of the card would be concealed (apart from in the case of the alternative card product that is a single perforated sheet).
But you've raised an interesting point. Our original user journey was a smooth sequence of events where the user would pick up the card, have it activated and scan the card with the app, without the 'friction' involved in having a scratch area on the card. That, rather than the minimal extra cost involved in card processing, was the thinking behind it. 
The added value in the customer not feeling as though they had to rush to redeem could, as you suggest, be a selling point. We are going to do some thinking around this. Really good of you, though, to take the time to expand your original point and share your thoughts with us - thank you for helping us get this project right :)

Thanks for the positive response. The business plan shows we'd have to charge around 4% over market rate (see fuller answer below). We're being fully transparent about this... obviously development and distribution costs  would account for some of this.

Yes, of course. It's worth mentioning that we are doing this campaign as a limited company rather than as individuals so that all accounts can be audited. So far we have spent £18,000 to get it this far. That is from our own pockets. We are not drawing a salary. We need about £80,000 to pay for specialist software development and card distribution. That is excluding servers, hosting, office rent, and when the shop opens that will cost an additional £15,000 every three months for rent in a busy commercial centre. Printing cards is very cheap, everything else required for them to work safely in existing commercial infrastructure is enormously expensive. The pie chart on the campaign page is accurate, presuming we get £150,000.

It's an all-or-nothing funding campaign.

Nice one, Jonathan. Great to see this taking shape.

Of course I did! I bought a beer using my HTC. Was a great feeling :)

Just because you don't know about them doesn't mean they don't exist. There's Catheryne, the chief engineer at Blockcypher, Susan, the hardware developer at Blocktech, Sheryl at QuidPOS and UltracoinGirl. And I'm half of the dev team at CountMyCrypto and I'm female. There's probably a couple others I've forgotten... we're might not be very vocal, but we're not total unicorns. As for the OP, no I don't think Peter Todd is misogynist.

Try getting in touch with Futurecoins ( on Twitter). He's installed a Bitcoin ATM in a cafe around the corner from countmycrypto HQ in London - we went to meet him the other night and he seems very together and like he'd know how to get his hands on another one.

Really nice of you to give feedback, and happy to hear you are finding it useful. At the moment our coin range is limited by what Cryptsy have on their exchange, but I'm also hoping to use the Poloniex API at some point soon, which should pull in a few coins :)

It's a bar called Room77 in Berlin. I gave them a mention in the previous Twitter status but you're right - should have namechecked them on Reddit as well :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:22:24
We looked at existing scratchcard solutions, but our idea relies on activation at the point of checkout, and the card has no value until activated, so should in any case be safe.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:06:25
Ultimately, our aim is to get the cards into major retail stores globally. However, the first phase of our project will be focused on London because that is where we are based and it is the area we know best. Personally, I would like to see the cards in the Netherlands. I did a contract in Amsterdam a couple of years ago and absolutely love the country (and its attitude to Bitcoin!).
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:09:30
It was honestly so cool. Weather in Berlin was amazing today and I sat outside Room77 in the sunshine just chilling and drinking a German beer and doing some coding - there's some stuff about the bar here:  They've been taking btc since 2011!

Thanks... the idea is that the display price is always fixed in fiat terms but the Bitcoin price will obviously fluctuate. So we're aiming for three small-to-medium denominations of fiat (say, £10, £25, £50 for the UK) - we're not aiming to be an exchange or compete with them. We're talking to a card activation company about partnering with them, and the idea is that the Bitcoin value would always be calculated at the moment of activation at the checkout, with a small fixed premium over the market price (still under discussion but we'd guarantee to be cheaper than the ATMs.. around 4% due to the cost of the cards and distribution). Our target market is people who are not already using Bitcoin but who probably would once they realise the benefits... by placing ourselves alongside the iTunes and XBox gift cards we'd be an easy first-time buy for people who might not otherwise be motivated to set up an account on an exchange.

At the moment I'm limited by what's on Cryptsy but hoping to add data from Poloniex also soon... watch this space for more coins!

And another one - Floors. The Berlin Bitcoin Lab monthly meetup is this Thursday at Room77 and I am going to Floors beforehand to meet someone in the community here. I am here on a short contract (normally based in London) and only wish I'd got here sooner. The level of cryptocurrency awareness is high compared with the UK.
