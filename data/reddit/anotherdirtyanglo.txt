Not for their premium service, only for webcam shows, apparently.

When money is a little less tight, I'll pick up a "recent-enough" Mac Mini to replace it.  I've never pulled the drive out of one before, but a simple SSD swap should make it possible to bring it back up to date.

I'm just saying, I've got an old MacBook with 10.7 (and a 480GB SSD) that has served as a full node for 3+ years.  It's a shame that I'll have to decommission it.

I'm familiar with Linux, just never installed it on a Mac before.

It would go faster if Bitcoin Core hadn't cut support for Mac OS 10.7.x.

I'll send you my address, and you can send it to me.  ;)
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:57:57
Sure, I just don't have the spare hardware lying around for it.
@_date: 2016-11-08 01:21:21
Thx.  :)
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:44:09
Nope, it just runs Bitcoin Core.  That's it's only purpose in life.  
As I mentioned in another comment, I'll try to find a replacement box for it (an older Mac Mini would work fine) and go from there.
@_date: 2016-11-08 01:19:47
It's actually very well supported with Mac OS X.

This seems to happen a lot from the twitter accounts of IBM employees.  They're sending out the same tweet hundreds/thousands of times.
I think what IBM does is say "You can have a twitter account for work, but we need access to it."  And this is how they use it, sending out the same tweet thousands of times to game the system. 
To what end, I have no idea.

I challenge you to find someone's identity from a transaction conducted over a dynamically-assigned IP, over WiFi to a second-hand computer bought with cash, in a coffee shop, in a mall, in a city of 3m+ people.

Seems like you've got it figured out.  Let us know who the donor is.

A friend of mine who worked for them got laid off after 30 years, for the crime of earning too much money.

My buddy was helping IBM rake in millions every year, keeping Wall Street banks happy with their storage systems &amp; databases.
They'll basically be outsourcing the profits he used to make to whichever company picks him up instead.  So dumb.

The fact that you can't tie this to more than a webmail address or twitter account just proves my point.  That's pseudo-anonymity.  You've tracked someone down to a pseudonym, which is extraordinarily likely to NOT be their real name.
Yes, with the resources and authority of some of the largest law-enforcement agencies in the world, you could dig deeper, and maybe find the individual responsible, with their name, address, phone number, and birthdate, etc.  But all but the largest governments and law enforcement agencies don't have that -- so one is relatively insulated against being discovered from 99.99999% of the world.

The sad thing is that what sounds like the start of a paranoid delusion isn't that far off from reality. The Snowden revelations and other NSA hacks (like how they intercept, modify, then repackage Cisco routers in transit, or the interception of leased fiber lines of companies like Yahoo, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, or the tools released by the Shadow Brokers) all prove that this isn't a science fiction spy-thriller fantasy, it's a reality that you're exposed to, no matter how much denial you're in.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:06:43
Is there really?  The Gemalto hack conducted by the NSA was clearly a way to conduct BOTH mass surveillance *and* spy on an individual.  Not to mention that having the encryption keys may have possibly made it easier to hack hardware as well....  Keep a copy of everyone's encryption keys, then record all the traffic from every network you can get your hands on.  Decrypt none, some, or all traffic, at your leisure at any time.

Don't be naïve.  There's someone in your government who knows what it is and what it's about.  I'd order another one to a different address like a post office box, or hotel.  (It helps to have a reservation at the hotel for the week after the item is due to arrive.)

Micropayments have always been troublesome.  I doubt that the blockchain wants to get involved in millions/billions/trillions of microscopic transactions.  The fees would be as much as (or more than) the transactions themselves.

The problem is that licensing deals are normally country specific, not worldwide.  This is why iTunes has stores around the world.
