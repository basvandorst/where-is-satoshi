I'm not 100% sure on what the script he posted does as I do not know python. My understanding of cracking electrum wallets is as follows:
1. Some hash of a password is embedded in the encrypted wallet, hash2. The user inputs a password, hash(password) = hash1, hash(hash1) = hash2. hash1 is probably the encryption key and since its hash is saved it doesn't have to be revealed.
2. Extract hash2.
3. Send hash2 to op.
4. Op attempts to forward compute hash2.
5. If op finds the password he sends it back to you.
So you should never need to send a wallet file to anyone because that would reveal your private key. Instead op should only get the embedded hash.
There's already software that does this called btcrecover I believe. Difference is the cracking part isn't optimized. Wouldn't be surprised if op just pulled the extraction script from that project.

In terms of alts: Monero is the only one that has good devs and a well thought out system - where all transactions are fundamentally private and there are mandatory hard forks every 6 months. Their devs are honest, sceptical, and don't operate with a malevolent level of greed.
RSK is one of the only interestesting companies. They're bringing a semi-centralized, touring complete side chain to BTC. They're doing what eth should have done - tapping into the liquidity of BTC. Large retailers probably would prefer (due to gov coercion) a more controlled side chain. If it pans out, RSK will probably implement LN and be able to transfer btc via ln through their federated pegs. So we'd get crypto-anarchy while pretending to be legit for regulators.
Open Bazaar is a cool idea and looks like is has decent developers. If they ICO we'll have to lynch them though.
Namecoin was a good idea but they didn't have much talent and it wasn't the right time for them.
That's about it. Everything else is either a scam or a manifestation of the over regulated industries in Western nations. It's easy to regulate producers of physical stuff to extinction because they require physical locations that are easily discoverable. So there is an imbalance in markets where a disproportionate amount of wealth and human capitol goes to increasingly abstract industries. In the big picture most programming languages, software, and websites are entirely redundant.

From a technological standpoint it has been solved / mitigated. Here's a brief list of solutions:
1. Segwit (Active) - rearranges block data and creates room for dynamic scaling
2. Lightning Network (in beta testing | depends on Segwit)
3. Sidechains | RSK - most likely to be used by businesses and corporations (in beta testing | no dependencies)
4. Schnorr Signatures - reduces cost of certain transactions &amp; cost of executing more complex scripts (depends on segwit)
5. Drivechain - uses a brain bending mining escrow mechanism to verify sidechains and transfer BTC to and from sidechains in a trustless way (Currently waiting for a BIP number assignment)
6. Bulletproof Transactions - reduced size of confidential transactions by approximately x4
One of the big issues is that Segwit adoption is only at around 10%. So it is important you try discriminate from non-segwit addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:58:09
I think it would me more than at. I'm trying to learn more about Schnorr signatures but there isn't very much information.
Segwit alone, just based on how the block data is rearranged increases block space by 64-65%. It does something else that allocates another chunk of data. So segwit alone could increase transaction volume x4. Schnorr signatures do some kind of compression for certain transactions. I can't remember exactly how they effect this.
It would be nice to see the blockchain processing 1,200,000 transaction per day which it could do.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:42:32
The answer to this question is very simple. I honestly do not know why it keeps getting asked. And nobody points this out.
Bitcoin pre lightning:
* Computation requirements for mining increase in accordance with Moore's law.
Bitcoin post lightning
* Relative to new transaction volume on the lightning network, energy consumption per transaction becomes logarithmic.

Are you talking about net quantities or rates of change? Because 10% to 12% is a 20% net increase.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:08:00
My understand of it is that 65% of a block is witness data. That data is not removed - it is reorganized because it is not useful for miners. That 65% gets freed up, so it can be replaced with transaction data. So, if originally 35% of a block is only transaction data then we're looking at almost a x3 increase from that.

No. If you look around you can find theories but it is next to impossible to calculate. There is an economic law concerning the value of communications networks - Metcalf's Law. There are two interpretations of the law:




Then the question arises: how do we even calculate the value of the network? Is it the market cap? Is it the transaction volume? Do we calculate it in Bitcoin? Do we calculate it in USD?
Even worse, how do we define "nodes"? Is a Coinbase wallet a node? Is an electrum wallet a node? Is a miner a node? How would we discover the number of half-nodes / partial-nodes using full nodes as proxies?

The node scenario you presented sounds like an opportunity for insurance. Have you and the other developers considered theoretical additional "layers" following LN? If monetary systems used to issue inflationary bank notes backed by rare metals, can't an addition payment layer provide this? It just seems cyclical.
Of course there will be a crowd that cries for on-chain inflation, but this is no different than the current crowds that would like land and fresh water to appear out of thin air. If anything though, the demand for inflation will lead to another hard fork, less fruitful than the previous.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:25:54
The proof is dependent on two conjectures:




So we transpose a set of data, S, to two smaller sets A and B: 
A is a set of relevant variables for satisfying the system of equations to produces S. A provides a *congruent* result.
B is a set of relevant conditions for A, where for all combinations of A there exists one set that is *congruent* and *equal* to S when A satisfies the conditions of B.
So there is an exchange where computational work is traded for storage. A really bad example is this:
Say we have a hash, and four words: "calculator", "weight", "spoon", "cup". Some combination of those words produces the hash. We don't need to store the words in any particular order. The trade between work and storage is a way of taking the order of data out of a file and saying some combination of that data produces a file congruent to these conditions.
Or look at it this way. We have a file like this:


What if we say... of 1:3, of 3:3, of 4:2, of 5:3, of 7:6, of 8:6, of 9:3. And there exists a hash H, such that some combination of these numbers, when hashed, is equal to H.
The key is to provide as many conditions without taking up too much space, so that a collision/overlap of various conditions creates definitive answers as to what goes where. The more conditions, the less work needs to be performed.

Go fork Bitcoin and make your own POS alt. Good luck creating the incentive structure for that though... You didn't read anything I said. The ratio of POW to transactions decreases as more layers are implemented. POS is DEPENDANT on POW because POW generates the capital for POS to exist.

How would mining change? Miners would still verify transactions - the same number of transactions. The difference is that one transaction would be a set of many transactions. This isn't a theory. LN is on track to be implemented. There are beta versions of various apps already.
The number of transactions on the main chain will likely remain the same. The fact that Bitcoin's transaction volume is maxed out every day and has been for... years now is indicative that exponential scaling will not alter activity on the base layer.
Specifically on mining competition, there are now three companies producing mining hardware specifically with two Japanese companies entering the market (GMO and DDM). Clearly these companies see it as a viable industry.

I see... so you know that regular retail businesses don't deposit money immediately, right? On a regular basis, usually daily they settle all their payments. This includes cash. They take all their cash to a bank, all their checks and the bank settles the payments. That cash can be counter-fit, the checks can be void. The difference with the lightning network is, because of the base layer we have 100% assurance none of the value is fraudulent. Then, because of the contract, we have 100% assurance the money exists and settlement can occur.
Yes, immutable contracts are satisfactory for business operations. Yes, an enormous amount of business is conducted based on insured settlement, prior to money changing hands. Even most drug dealers who run large scale operations use insurance based systems. This is a fundamental aspect of business. What you're demanding does not exist anywhere.
Even if you were to say that transacting gold is the most pure form of instantaneous value exchange, that would not be valid because gold can be made impure and has to be validated.

With the software that's available you basically have it maxed out. I'm assuming you're GPU mining. The only way to get more juice out of that setup would be run a dedicated mining computer that runs Ubuntu server. On the server, you can install Nvidia drivers for your GPU and also run a CPU miner. The server just allows you to max out your CPU usage because no other processes should get in the way.
I looked into the Nvidia CUDA, which is a library C/C++ programmers use to do GPU programming. I didn't find assembly language support, so I imagine the GPU miners are under-utilizing the hardware by at least 20%. I also haven't found any CPU miners written in assembly, which is about an 40-50% under-utliziation of the hardware.

If you don't want your browser mining cryptocurrency, specifically monero, don't waste your time installing extensions and ad blockers. That software is sketchy and buggy. Instead, every OS (to my knowledge) allows for direct memory allocation and CPU allocation. You'll have to do some research, but say you use Firefox. You ought to be able to configure your process management so that Firefox never exceeds 5-10% of your CPU's activity.
Due to the proliferation of "asic resistant" cyrptocurrencies, the javascript miner in the browser is only going to escalate. All the extensions and blockers you install will always be behind the curve of the most recent development. That's like using a bulky antivirus rather than running a daemon to detect root access, access on port 80, or weird activity in the system files.

I am currently working on a mathematic proof for a compression algorithm that can reduce the size of random data. If it is viable, I'll be able to compress a wallet to into a very small file. Nested within the compression functions will is a key that the user may input. Because the compression will work on random data, a cypher (encryption) can also be use before and after the compression.
So, two or three sets of keys to decrypt an encrypted wallet. And a key for the encrypted wallet. And a file small enough to be written by hand, so we may avoid using printers.

The lightning network is proof of stake. We're going to have a proof of stake network as a second layer to proof of work. The third layer the follows will likely contain more variations of cryptographic proof systems.
Energy consumption of the network is logarithmic not linear. Also arguments about energy use are a false dicotomy. I'll elaborate if you're interested.

I should just write an article explaining this. This is basically how it works:
"Bitcoin is using a lot of energy, therefore it is a mis-allocation of resources". Or something like that.
A lot of arguments from environmental standpoints make this mistake, the implied contingents are ignored. So, let's talk about things that are really bad for the environment: (1) War. Can we agree nuclear detonations are bad for the environment? Think of the carbon footprint of deploying a sum of over 2 million soldiers and contractors to the Middle East. (2) Massive displacement of persons. European nations have subsidize the transportation and are paying for the costs of housing millions of warm-weather acclimated persons way up in the northern hemisphere. The energy consumption of Germany has increased... 3% I think since last year. (3) Inflating the national currency to discourage saving and encourage spending - this leads to artificial levels of demand, over consumption and over production. (4) Subsidizing products - this defers the actual cost of a product and encourage over consumption and production. (5) Making plants illegal - industrial hemp is banned in most nations around the world despite its thousands of uses, ability to add nitrogen to soil, and of course, one square acre of hemp uses more CO2 than a square acre of trees.
There are a plethora of other absent energy optimizations that are bi-products of government initiatives.
Always be suspicious of environmentally based arguments. The tend to be very manipulative. And of course, since mining equipment is open to market competition, there are new competitors entering the market creating more powerful, more energy efficient computers. Look up "Japanese Bitcoin mining companies".
Lastly, take into account, businesses operating in free markets always seek to reduce overhead. Energy consumption is enormous overhead. The notion of the environmentally destructive business is more of a strawman than a reality. Businesses can only over consumer when prices are fake. Individuals can only over consume when prices are fake. So if we want a cleaner, less polluted world, it's clear that finger wagging is not a solution but allowing the price mechanism to work itself out. Of course, the implication of this is maybe you'd have to drive less and your corn would cost... ten times as much but there'd be less consumption wouldn't there?

That's what I was getting at. By "large" I meant financial magnitude relative to the LN transactions. Since we've clarified that, this is where I'm confused about your article. Let's express an on chain transaction T as an equation:
Let T be a transaction. Let V be the value to be transacted. Let F be the miner fee. Then, T = V + F.
Since T is the sum of the transaction value and the fee, T is the sum of a set of lightning transactions that can be expressed as A, where A is a 1x(near-infinite) matrix. Thus we have the equation, like the equation of a matrix Ax = T. A is a set of 1 dimensional vectors S such that S = {t1, t2, ... , tn-1, tn} and x is a solution set where all x = 1. Then for each t in S, t = v + f, where v is the value of the lightning transaction and f is the fee. So we can also express S as S = { (v1+f1), (v2+f2), ... , (vn+fn) }.
Then both V and F are sets, where V = {v1, v2, ... vn} and F = {f1, f2, ... fn} - r, where r is the revenue generated (of fees kept) the Lightning Network custodian.
This is where I'm confused. F can rise to any arbitrary value relative the number of vectors in F, V, and S. F is only the fee for one transaction, while r is the sum of fees for many transactions. So LN should cover mining fees so long as the rate of settlement is long enough for said fees to accumulate. A custodian with ample capitol could delay settlement for a long time.

Well... here's the thing: we don't have certainty on what software the miners are running. So if we have two competing mining pools we don't know if they're guessing the same nonce. Chances are there is some overlap in their guessing but ultimately that is up to them.
What it comes down to is in order create value and security, a supercomputer level of power is required. All of the computational power behind bitcoin sets its base price and protects the network from attacks. 
Miners have the highest economic incentive to be efficient and use the cheapest energy. Think about how much energy gets wasted serving porn videos, video games, etc. Or how much energy gets wasted waging war. Energy has to be utilized to do anything. What is most important is it's being used for.

False dicotomy. 
War and the displacement of persons is bad for the environment.Inflating the currency to discourage savings and encourage spending, this increasing consumerism is bad for the environment. Making industrial hemp, one of the largest consumers of CO2 illegal is bad for the environment. Subsidizing products to defer price realization and encourage overproduction is bad for the economy.

Yes you're misunderstanding. Every 2016 blocks the difficulty is adjusted where there is either an increase or a decrease depending on network performance. The miners search for a nonce, which is just a number. They don't know the nonce because it is hashed. So they have to guess what the nonce is and perform a variety of hashes on it, check for equality, repeat (the hash is also has data dependent on previous blocks, which is why they cannot calculate all the hashes beforehand). So if you have a nonce that is between 0-999 and you have 100 miners, each one only needs to guess 10 nonces before you find the right one.
The difficulty adjustment exists because of Moore's law. The network latency of 10 minutes is entirely different. That's a matter of bandwidth and size of data transfers. It is the nodes that get 10 minutes to put a bunch of transactions together in a block. They get around 10 minutes (more or less) because at the time that was what Satoshi determined to be a reasonable latency for the node's whispering protocol. Other cryptocurrencies have lower latency, like Litecoin, which is 5 minutes.
So more miners means blocks get hashed faster. Everyone mining pool breaks hashes into groups and each individual miner hashes through a range of hashes. If you look at the network hash rate, you can see instances where a lot of hashing was diverted to Bcash, which caused the block time to reach 30 minutes to an hour. The nonce has to be found for the block to be verified.

Debt and lending is not inherently bad. Nation states get into debt when they control currency issuance and use the promise of warfare and welfare to get votes. Corporations get into excessive debt when they know the nation state will bail them out. Individuals get into excessive debt when the nation state forces lenders to to make loans the individuals do not qualify for (ie. almost all college loans).
Since no one controls bitcoin, the capacity to make these stupid decisions would be mitigated enormously.

Running a seqwit node signals that you are using a segwit wallet and you are storing the blocks with the protocol improvement. Miners (not all miners - those who are interested in advancing this protocol improvement) will take that as a message to mine segwit blocks.
Because it is a soft fork, miners can still transition back and forth and mine all blocks. But, it is preferable for the entire network to transition to segwit, which is doable. If that occurred right now, the transaction capacity of the network would increase.

There is one big problem with this. You need to account for the size of the blockchain. I'd consider 3 things: do users actually need immediate access to all data? Is there a file format you can use that enables a high level of compression? Do you need to store all data forever or is there a clearing period like every 1025 block gets erased?

The private key is never included in the block. Go to blochain.info, find their api and download a .json block. You can read the whole thing. The public key is a hash of the private key. This is how it works:
To produce a script where you send x btc from pubkey a to pubkey b you have to be able to produce the hash of privkey a.
Then your node broadcasts the script. At that point the other nodes just verify the balance of pubkey a.

No this is a byproduct of the changing value of a fixed asset. The value any fixed asset generates for an individual is logarithmic, where the owners who buy at the earliest point in time experience the greatest gain. People who own the asset later still experience an increase in value, but at that point in time the rate of change is much lower than the beginning.
