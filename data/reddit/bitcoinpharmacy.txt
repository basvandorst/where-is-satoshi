Nope, we pledge on being a CAN-SPAM compliant business.
We hate spammers as much as everyone does.

We started off by analyzing dozens of templates (from both the pharma &amp; bitcoin ecosystems). We then picked apart each UX/UI to determine which had the best design, functions, and ease-of-use. The final result is what we feel is most likely to give the end-user an easier and more comfortable shopping experience.
Thank you for your feedback though.

In all honesty, many people are not technologically savvy enough (to handle Tor software, visiting hidden services, etc) or comfortable with accessing 'Silk Road' style anonymous marketplaces.

Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers have captured over 30% of the US generic drug market. They have earned a fantastic reputation for manufacturing the highest quality API and finished dosage formulations.
Buying medication from India directly is a very safe and affordable alternative for individuals around the world.

The problem with Silk Road is that it's a den of activity that a lot of people aren't very comfortable being part of for obvious reasons. We provide an easy, safe, and affordable way for individuals to obtain their medication.
