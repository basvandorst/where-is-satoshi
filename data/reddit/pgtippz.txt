The crypto way buy high sell low.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:46:13
convenience 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:56:48
This 20k wall is massive far bigger than the 10k wall. Will take a while to break through but if it does dont worry Ill still have some. Once it's breached its easily getting to 25k
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:37
Ban it from the sub mods?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:52:15
Yeah I have an income for now, but having put in £750 I think I needed to reign it back to a more sensible number and make it less stressful lol I would love to see Bitcoin widely accepted but it's not worth me putting so much in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:11
it did yes.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:12:44
This is nothing in comparison to the 10k usd wall this 12k usd wall is far smaller, it'll be done in the next 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:05
At one point it was +50% for 24 hours. I mean at this rate you don't need a job ^^^^/s
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:02:26
Thanks, it's a scary game but I intend to stick around, I'm not leaving just yet. No way could I justify investing £1500 in BTC with my current balance, I needed to reset how much I have invested. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:19:41
Id rather memes be on than bitcoin is dead news.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:51:30
Into someone elses wallet innit
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:29:47
eat up that dip boys Im selling the rest of mine at midnight tonight 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:05
I sold but I regretted my decision and bought back, I believe that this will go back, 20kUSD total hasnt changed, 130M USD its just more spread out atm trust the market will come back up gradually.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:16:02
Ridiculous sold another half, will sell the next half once it picks up 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:04
As a student I just sold half of my bitcoin, that 20k wall is scary and I see others dipping out, I can't afford to have 1/3 of my money in BTC right now. 13/10/2017-03/12/2017 it's been fun (still hodling £100) I got my moon of 130% profit
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:57:19
I want to see that shit recorded man
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:12
Can't think like that there's a guy I know that formatted his hard drive with 100BTC and can't restore it nor does he know his seed.  You'll survive and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:47
I sold it all dont worry +£500 in a couple of months from £750
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:30:03
Everyone expected a 10k selling dip but if the hype goes on there is no dip...
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:45
Bye bye 0.12635323 bitcoin it was fun haha
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:43
It wont help the price when people cant get on to buy them and everyone is selling theirs...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:39
is every office around the world staring at bitcoin charts today lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:27:29
Time for a cup of tea that was glorious
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:19:59
Yeah I need to save for a car, and not a lamborghini ;) 
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:26:41
So my friend gets my phone and sends himself all my money... mkay GOOD FUCKING IDEA!
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:41:54
When you can't make a name for your own cryptocurrency why steal half of the name to seem relevant when you aren't?  
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:16:52
I did have my chance and I did try to buy but it didnt go through.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:56:15
One day 1BTC&gt;OP's house value, so I wouldn't worry ;)
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:13:42
CRASH ALREADY WTFFFFF
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:15:52
and again if these were never sold then BTC wouldnt be where it's at now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:50:01
Expecting a big 10k crash.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:16:12
Can it crash please... I need to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:36:22

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:27:56
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:00:56

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:54:26

@_date: 2017-11-27 07:53:55
Back in the 4 figure days 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:57:36
and Im struggling to buy right now at work lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:25:09
Really struggling to eat through that 10k wall but its calm sailing after that again.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:21:23
dont worry man his javascript is a bitcoin miner on the page anyway !
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:08
1mBTC is $10 Buy up on this cheap online currency while it's still small!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:57:37
Absolutely! Every single second hundreds of bitcoins are traded for fiat currency... but why would you want to do that?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:17
Im already on but Im not getting off at 8k...
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:13:22
Id say buy half or a quarter of what you intend to invest now and watch how it goes if it drops buy some more every week or so.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:52:27
Early life lesson lol fuck alts buy and ignore.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:12:51
my subwoofer enjoyed this lmao
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:12:28
How does bitcoin accept loans and mortgages? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:27:14
December 25th 11:45 AM GMT
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:18:05

Either buy now or invent the time machine 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:14:05

@_date: 2017-10-20 18:05:57
