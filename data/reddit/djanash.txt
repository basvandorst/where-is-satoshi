Not necessarily, in our practice its about 50%-50%
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:24:41
I guess you guys are right, Ive been on my own little r/bitcoin bubble and everyone around me talks about it so much. It is not indicative of the real world, yet!
I guess the Overstock news threw me for a loop :)

well how did two computer geeks do it before the VC funds got in with them? 
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:31:50
I'm glad some one else has done this. I started accepting a few weeks back and though the response has been meek at my dental office the potential is there
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:29:40
i could move it into Mt Gox for a second and then move it out onto a paper/offline wallet couldn't I?
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:45:44
yep, and gyft prays for that 3% for "protection"
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:47:49
Will do!
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:56:52

Thanks for the reassurance 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:43:33
In Midtown, look up "Park South Dentistry" 
at 30CPS - Id love to meet and see how we can help ;)
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:39:49
Obviously fake
80% discount on advertising? Yeah right
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:00:03
some days you make out the plus side of that, some days you'd lose. Id bet you end up getting exactly what you think you are over time. the risk is virtually eliminated when the time is zero too - so I wouldnt be too concerned 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:46:44
Great Idea! we actually give away movie tickets when an existing patient refers a friend of family in. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 20:04:54
Yep, did that. Truth be told it looks like we have a double listing, I can't seem to get rid of - When we signed up there was only about 2 thousand listing now its approaching 3k!
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:59:45
though I am a huge fan of BTC, this is a case where a judge, lawyer some precedence and a central source is missing and could be used.
I have an idea for a bitcoin etiquette /conduct / code  website for these matters, does any one know if it exists? or this against the philosophy of BTC?
Where would 2 moron lawyers figure what to do? thetas the core question answered - PM with any interest. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:46:19
I am all for bitcoin popping up to 20K and going onto 1e6, but you've gotta be concerned about deflation and zero spending if that happens. All the hoarding will be bad. Cant wait to see what happens though
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:10:09
ill give you 501! lol
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:28:37
Thank you
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:02:26
didn't see that - wow! what nerve
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:28:36
Yep, its there
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:47:10
What a great discussion this has been - we now return to our regularly schedule Bitcoin infatuation. Thanks for clarifying everyone
@_date: 2014-03-22 06:08:28
Does samsung make a iPod Touch like device that will let me do my BTC thing with out a cell phone bill?
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:44:31
Yes - I never heard of some of the other ones after coin map.
I will set those up too
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:56:54


can you provide a link, can't find it
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:02:39
Great post, I was there with you and couldn't agree more. I think it time the cream will rise to the top. The BS slowly goes away
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:31:20
so once its there I can't move into another place?
@_date: 2014-01-22 05:04:38
Precisely why I decided to start accepting BTC- to remove barriers for people in need and do my part to diversify and expand the marketplace.
I do my part in spending bitcoin, going to meet ups by Wall Street on 40 Broad and brainstorming with others as well. The money alone doesn't motivate me as much as the idea of a BTC economy, the fact that I am contributing time and energy makes me feel all the richer. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:25:34
Ive been accepting it in my dental office(s) for a while too! the response has been positive but to date only 2 people have paid for services in bitcoin. (High ticket elective care)
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:26:17
What AMC and Lowes need to do is create a channel through your PS4 or AppleTV to Buy a BoxOffice movie via bitcoin and stream it to your house for X# of BTC. Fuck Paying 5 bucks for a tub of popcorn in a crowded theatre
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:48:38
Will do that! Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:50:04

@_date: 2013-12-31 14:57:47

@_date: 2013-12-29 02:10:45
Look up Park South Dentistry, If I can ever help Let me know :)
It's on Central Park South by the hotels and the apple store
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:34:23
I spoke with a lawyer today and he tole me that NY state is still in limbo and has no clear direction about how it will enforce this onto BitCoin operators yet. At the very least, a FinCen federal license is what you need and that can be done on line in 20 minutes. 
Im not saying I trusted the guy, but I would love to know the name of the lawyers you spoke with to get this info. 
After doing some poking around myself it does seem like you both were right and thats the worst thing that could have happened to me. Can I have a reference? PM me anytime :)
Thanks in advance
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:53:27
Thanks so much! I actually figured it out but havent seen the update yet?
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:38:42
because you keep making spelling errors lol
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:42:56
I can't tell if thats the funniest thing I've ever read or some amazing piece of info that I need to know about LOL
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:35:52
cool! i understand
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:15:57
Just tried to set it up and had to use the Open street map editor. It was a little confusing, maybe its cause I'm using Safari, but I hope it works. The site gives a vague set of directions. I will wait an hour to see if it updates it . Thanks
Any advice on how to make it easier?
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:37:20
care to share where and how you heard this?
I know you need a %, but my math says its more like 10K
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:54:18
Im trying! I love the disruptive potential and I have always been into techy, geeky stuff - even at the dental office!
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:48:15
I will announce on our FaceBook and send out a email to the DataBase as soon as I am back in the office in Early Jan. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:52:22
I figured it out last night and as of this morning no updates yet. I will try again later and see if I can contact some one. 
How long does it take? the site says it updates every hour but who knows?
OSM seems like such a cool site!
