No government is for eternity. The majority of the people are needed of course, but when people have had enough of it, when they realise that all of them united they're always stronger, they'll win! Always! Dictators still in charge? The people haven't realised their true power, yet.

I think  rightfully mentioned the 5 billion minting, it happened. It was a mistake though and they immediately burned the whole 5 billion. It took a while before the info got out, but it's rightfully mentioned by whale_alert. Bitcoinist should rectify I think.

I think this must be possible with an Ethereum smart contract, and I think you can wrap BTC on that. I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but your answer is definitely yes, this should be possible. See if you can get in touch with some ETH developers, this is what Vitalik envisioned. These things is what Ethereum is build for.

Fair enough. I don't even know how relevant it is, but seams legit that when a new high is set, the market cap will also be maxed out, I'm not even sure if it works like that. Can you also have a bigger market cap and a lower price? Think not, right? The growing market cap is impressive I must say, good post to remind me. Let's set higher highs, and let the market cap reach into the trillions! First target, $7 trillions, how long would it take? Anyone who dares to make that guess?
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:20:43
You dumb or what? If regular people commit a crime they go to jail. If bankers commit crimes the walk. Every time again. History is filled with crimes, fraude, money laundering and what not. And when they screw up, politicians bail them out with our tax money. This has nothing to do with your liquor store robber. No banker went to jail for all the fraud they commit. They're above the law. Now explain that to yourself, you can't.

Different people have tried to 'invent' new/better money over time, there was something like e-gold and the liberty dollar or something like that, and possibly even more. Those were not decentralised and were killed/shutdown. But bitcoin is the result not of someone suddenly having a good idea one day, but more building on a tradition that spans over years, decades even. Satoshi Nakamoto was just the first to combine different aspects like peer2peer, decentralisation, cryptography and what not that makes up bitcoin. I think people are always open for 'better/harder' money as long as the money minters like central banks or governments fuck this up. History shows they always will. Now there is an alternative. The time will come that everyone on earth wants bitcoin, they just don't know it, yet.

Those are also MY posts, pleas don't go around screaming bullshit. I posted in different threads, hoped for a good answer. It seams to me that almost every one means well, but nobody likes to pay for education. Almost no one took the course, I was hoping to find someone who did. I see a lot of people calling him a scammer, but almost no one even seams to have seen his free content. Although a few did, and mentioned they think, just like me, that he is good in what he does. I know there are a lot of scammers, and I will always be careful, but I don't think he is a scammer, just wanted to know if his payed content is worth it, and at least as good as his free content. I'm not new at TA nor crypto, also not to trading, but there is always a lot to learn, and he goes in depth. So far, I like his style. So, somebody knows his payed content, and is it worth it?

@_date: 2019-07-14 11:19:40
You're partly right. As long as the final equilibrium between supply and demand is  reached, so if the world has decided what the real price of a BTC is, and we're far away from that point, it makes more sense to hodl on, because it'll most likely appreciate in price/value. Never the less, people will pay for what they need. Suppose the dollar will appreciate in value but you need bread, or a car, will you not buy because tomorrow the dollar could be worth more? Off course not, you need to eat, and drive and will thus spend. Same with bitcoin. I do think that people will think better how to spend, possibly even save again for stuff instead borrow it, or buy on credit. It makes you think again, it did with me. I hodl, and occasionally spend. Remember, this currency is only 10 years old, it's still just the beginning.

And now it's around $11k you're already complaining if you get aboard now the profits won't be big enough?? Go to Las Vegas and see how that works. If you have any sense, buy BTC, HODL &amp; STFU. Thank me later.

When more people or institutions realise how scarce bitcoin is, the value will appreciate. So the function of a part of bitcoin, namely the store of value part does change with the price. It will become more  and more important, hence the price will rise. This will also add to adoption. It would be great to pay only in btc, but we're not there yet, and till that day, I've no problem in exchanging btc to fiat, or the other way around as long as it fits my needs. The beauty is that I've an extra choice in what I and we all choose as a currency and a store of value.

Since the internet your and mine whole life became digital. We do EVERYTHING online. The world has changed big time ever since. What was never possible, is now possible. Don't underestimate digital scarcity. Before you could always copy everything online. Download a file, or a movie? You actually make a copy of it. It was impossible to create something online that was protected, that was unique. Till bitcoin. It is going to make 21 million coins, unique, impossible to duplicate. You can transact global with them. It's impossible to censor. It's impossible to shut down. It's really scarce. It has no bank or governments manipulation. It's truly a revolution.

It's a revolution in money. It's a digital peer to peer currency, the first of his kind. It's a global digital ledger with all the transactions on it, called the blockchain. This is the first cryptocurrency ever, it's battle tested, it exists for a decade now and it's still standing and growing. As a currency, or even a store of value (like gold), it is still in his infancy. What is a decade, when you're fighting and succeeding in being an alternative to the current financial system with fiat money (dollars, euro, GBP etc) which loses value over time and is run by governments and central banks. Anybody can own (a piece of a) bitcoin. It's inclusive, whether you live in the west, or in Africa, India or Iran, it's open, anyone can participate. It's decentralized, there is no organisation or CEO, it's a global network, It's censorship resistant, no government can ban bitcoin, it's deflationary, meaning there is a fixed amount of bitcoins, (almost 21 million will ever exist), so they are really scarce, think about scarcity, really, think about that concept. Whenever everybody, the whole world understands all that, price will shoot to the moon. Learn more here: [

I understand your frustration, but this has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's banks that want to make it harder. Every time you hear the word money laundering (which mostly goes through banks) crypto companies have another rule to enforce on their customers. And know these exchanges have sometimes hundreds or even more people to on board all at once, they all have to go through kyc, AML and what not. Banks have the infrastructure, crypto companies are only recently building it. It's much harder for them to comply than for the old world. But hang on, you'll get there, and once you've find your way, you will enjoy all the extra possibilities, extra freedom, and yes, less fees. Myself I use Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Mycelium and Trezor. That's my crypto environment, you'll build your own. Hang in there! And if there is time to learn, you can always check:

Hell yeah. And the distribution system with cash to all registers in every shop, restaurant and what not, cars riding around, you have to look at the whole system. And go dig some gold in a mine, you'll need people, heavy trucks and machinery, and a global distribution network and what not. I assure you, bitcoin does not use to much energy, this energy is used for securing the biggest network on earth, this is what bitcoin makes bitcoin!

For small amounts it's fine. But keep on buying and the moment will come you don't want to leave it anywhere but on a hard wallet. I suggest Trezor, it's OpenSource. Investing a small amount is ok, but invest a small amount on a monthly base, and it could become life changing. Good luck!

That's pretty much it..? I didn't hear what the talk was about, just want to say that funding developers actively involved in Open Source projects (like bitcoin and what not) is a big and a good thing. A lot of people devote their time and efforts to add value without getting paid. Funding development is very important. Shout out to all open source developers, paid and non paid!

@_date: 2019-10-12 13:06:48
I'm sorry you have no clue. Constructively I posted links to learn about bitcoin. And my reasoning for 10x to 100x is based on a decade of price discovery, stock2flow charts and more, plus the conviction that bitcoin beats gold on any level but history, and bitcoin being better than any bank or government controlled fiat currency. It's the best, the hardest, soundest money ever invented by mankind and bitcoin will take over coming years and decades. Of course you can disagree, but don't state I have no clue or compare bitcoin to lottery tickets.
Edit: I don't get why this is downvoted, probably because I started with him not having a clue. But he said that himself in his post, and I only repeated that. But, whatever..

You probably did all that to have acces to the credit card in the past, or it is attached to your bank account where you al ready went through the kyc part. But search inside this subreddit, the same question is asked like 3 times this day only.

My guess is we reach 50k per bitcoin in 2 years. That's a damn good reason for not selling, right? Instead of selling you should be learning about bitcoin. It's the future. Check the talks of Andreas Antonopolous on YouTube, very inspiring, he knows what's at stake, what bitcoin might become and achieve. And you can learn a lot from this website:  Good luck!

May I suggest Krown's Crypto Cave, The Moon and Sunny Decree, those are all on YouTube and you can learn a lot from them. And don't trade with all you got, you should also build a stack to Hodl, it's the safest way to make profits in the long run with bitcoin. Good luck!

Yes. You're still early. I think that every dollar you spend on bitcoin will be anything between 10x or even 100x more worth in the future. This could be life-changing, especially in a country like yours. The second best investment would be in yourself.

Money restrictions for amount to get out of an ATM, and I even believe everyone with 100k or more lost 50% of the money above 100k. WHEN BANKS HAVE NO MONEY WE PAY! Always has, always will be.

Hodl is the safest way. We could be looking at a bitcoin price of around 50k per bitcoin end 2021. That's fast profit. And you could always try to get your feet wet with trading. Say 10% orso. But know that 99% of all traders blow there account. Most loose money. Most traders quit in the first 3 months. Hodl is a decade long proven way to be in profit. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-10-03 17:55:23
Store of value first, when bitcoin price has settled and is hardly volatile anymore, then it can function as a true currency. Besides, think of things like master card or visa or PayPal, those are layer 5 or 6 solutions on an payment environment existing for years, a century. Bitcoin is still in his infancy, those fast transaction layer 2 or 3 or more will be developed. We only just begun.

The dollar looses buying power slowly every day. The increase in buying power of one bitcoin will be exponential. It's possible you could buy a million dollars house in 2028 with one btc. I think this is possible and has nothing to do with hyperinflation, With hyperinflation the price of the house would be a lot more. So we have normal inflation with exponential growth in value for bitcoin. With hyperinflation of the dollar you could buy the house for 1 btc, which maybe equals 500 million dollars.

I agree. We might see places where they crack down on bitcoin, like the prohibition or the war on drugs. I just hope it won't go that way, but it's definitely a possibility. They could go to war. We kick the hornets nest, they could be coming for us. I hope it would not go that way..

You are wrong. You keep your keys for a lot of reasons, crazy to suggest to keep them only if society collapses. You are thinking about nuclear war or what? Society will go on for years , decades and centuries, and gradually fiat will become obsolete, this will take years and fiat and btc will live on together for a long time. It's about being your own bank, about sovereignty, about independence, about taking responsibility, about exhanges being hacked, about your own account, pc or phone being hacked. Hardware wallet and metal seed phrase in at least 2 locations is the way to go.

I still debunked all your FUD..
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:19:24
You are funny with this FUD! YOU DON'T Understand money, value, scarcity, blockchain, bitcoin and shitcoins. YOU INVESTED IN DENT, WTF?? LOL! I read some of your posts and you lost your investment in the amazing crypto coin DENT ($0.000246) of which I at least have never heard of, but I do not care about shitcoins. How dare you loose money on a shitcoin, and than giving Bitcoin, nr1 in the space, a lot of shit. You lack understanding of money, because than you would understand that money will evolve first as a store of value, than of medium of exchange, all though you COULD spend your bitcoin al ready at thousands of stores and shops. You lack the understanding that bitcoin will replace gold and fiat in marketcap, but it's a project that spawns over decades, bitcoin is still young and in her infancy. Than the bullshit of credit cards being faster, you should be aware that mobile payments and CC's and what not are layer 5 or 6 solutions build on a legacy system existing for a century, bitcoins lightning network is a layer 2 and under heavy development, we are not there yet, but we will get there. With proper layer 2, 3, 4 and 5+ solutions this will be possible with bitcoin. And still, do you even know that the bitcoin network al ready does more transactions than PayPall, which is verry impressive. And you state exchanges charge high fees, that has nothing to do with bitcoin. Person to person, wallet to wallet almost doesn't cost a thing. Last week someone transferred almost a billion US dollars with BTC for $3.90 that's fucking impressive, and impossible with normal banking. Fuck, I transferred $100.- with Western Union with fees of $3.80 so fuck that! And try to move your goldbars around the world, good luck with that! And expensive to store? On an exchange? Who does that? Are you a total n00b? Once you have a hardware wallet, it'll cost you nothing to store, also bullshit.
You totally don't understand bitcoin when you say the hardcap of 21 million does not exist because you can hardfork into more coins? So you also don't understand blockchain, and consensus, the fact that all nodes will have to except the new fork, if they don't, and choose to be with the longest chain which is bitcoin, nothing happens. The hardcap of bitcoin of 21 million coins is very real and makes it the scarcest asset on earth, scarcer than gold. Comparing bitcoin to Zimbabwe money is really making you look even dumber than any sentence before. And the fact that you could loose your money, yes you can, just like you could loose your dollars or gold, your bank could go bankrupt (in Cyprus 2013 they took 50% of anything that customers had on their bank above 100k!) and what not. If you handle your passwords with care, it will not happen. The fact that 90% of all bitcoin is hold by 5% is also bullshit, I think it was a business insider article where they didn't even understand that some of the biggest wallets are owned by very big exchanges, and thus owned by a lot more customers of those exchanges, but it gets counted as 1 wallet. And I can debunk all your FUD, I suggest you dry your tears about DENT, go learn, watch ALL Andreas Antonopolous videos, read Bitcoin, a decentralized alternative to central banking by Saifedean Ammous and read up on bitcoin here: [ AND stop with this FUD bullshit!
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:01:01
And overlap them! Please do OP!
@_date: 2019-10-15 10:05:24
You need to read up on Saifedean Ammouns: The Bitcoin Standard; The decentralized alternative for Central Banking. You'll learn about money, the evolution and history of it. In short to your answer, bitcoin has to prove itself first as a store of value (and is doing that as we speak, Gold 2.0!). Then adoption will rise. When we achieve mass adoption (and we're far away from that, even though the first 10 years of bitcoin are mega impressive), the volatility will be gone, and it will be used as a currency. That's more or less the path, remember, bitcoin is in his infancy, only a decade young. We will take on the dollar and any other fiat currency, but it is a project spawning over decades, not years or months. But it is al ready used as a currency by a lot of people, and lightning network, a layer 2 solution is al ready there to buy you a coffee with. It's all new terrain, but a firmly growing ecosystem. Last remark, you're talking about fees on Coinbase, that's has nothing to do with the fees needed for bitcoin transactions, Coinbase is a bank, and banks make profit. This week there was a bitcoin transaction of around a billion dollars, from wallet to wallet, the fees were around $3.97 . Last week I transferred around $100.- with Western Union, the fees were $3.80 So I paid around the same fees only for 100 dollars, while with bitcoin someone transacted a billion dollars for the same amount. That's impressive. Be patient, your grandchildren will get paid in Satoshi's and fiat will be non existent, and gold will only be used for jewelry.

First of all, I would buy and hold on to it, that makes you an investor for the long run, you just can't go wrong there, big profits in years to come. If you still want to trade, I would suggest start looking at traders. Some will say TA or Technical Analysis is bullshit, I found there is a lot to it. There are a lot of people out there, I found one of the best is Eric Krown's Crypto Cave, he is on YouTube and has a lot of free content, and streams live almost everyday. He is great in the way he analyzes the charts. Buy and hodl first, than trading would be my advise. Good luck and welcome!

Yes, I am an addict to. I just never panic sell or FOMO in. I trade a bit, Hodl the majority, and buy extra every month. A 1k or more price move up or down will get me very excited, but never worried for the long run. Bitcoin is a wild ride, you've got to learn to control your emotions. If you can't do that, just DCA and Hodl, and stop looking at price every minute. If you can control your emotions, enjoy the ride, up or down, 1 million dollar bitcoin is on the horizon!

If you can live your live without needing those savings in the near time, let's say coming 3 years, do it. Buy now, the price is relatively good/cheap, in the future we will never reach this low price again. Of course it could still go to around 7.5k or even 5k, though it could happen, I don't see it happen. If it would happen I would buy even more. I would buy now, and keep on buying smaller amounts every month or so from now. I would do this because I firmly believe bitcoin will reach 50k around a year from the next halving, and around 350k around 4 years later. This is no financial advise, but how I would go at it. But in NO way would I risk not being able to pay my rent, groceries and all the things you do need in your daily live. Good luck, and hang on, it's going to be a wild ride, and have fun, and keep learning about bitcoin. If you do it, welcome to the bitcoin space!

Bitcoin is king, eth might have a future, very unsure yet, they are still developing, could go wrong. But never put all your eggs in one basket. Devide your wealth ideally partly in fiat (always need that still) bitcoin, gold, land, owning your house. But your crypto should only be bitcoin, maybe some ETH. You have bitcoin, and you've shitcoins. Any other crypto does not have the same parts as bitcoin, being decentralised, open, immutable, censorship resistant, borderless and battle tested for over a decade. It's the best money ever invented, but still in his infancy. In the long run, decades, it will be better than gold or fiat, that's what I think. Yes spread your eggs over different baskets, but go full bitcoin only. Good luck and cheers!

We realise bitcoin is a chance for a better world, it's noble to help people with realising that. Thanks again, and keep making beautiful art like this! It's worth all the time energy and soul you put into it! Discovering the Times article from the Genesis block was a very delightful find, I'm sure I'll keep discovering more! Cheers!!

I assume you know nothing and understand even less because of your first sentence: "Bitcoin or ALTS ? The eternal question". I'm sorry you succeeded in loosing money in the best performing asset over the last decade, profits beating profits from every other stock, share, commodity, bond or whatever. I suggest you sell all your bitcoin, put your trust in fiat, banks and creditcard companies and leave it be. Bitcoin is not ment for you, and if you don't understand that, I do not have the time to explain..

Lol, it's on my desktop! I changed a wallpaper of a distopian future city, very grim, with the bitcoin symbol as a sun, shining her hopeful light on the destructed city for your bitcoin paper bill. It was a good change. I have looked at it and read your blog post on it, assuming you are Lucho Poletti? I'm going to check all your art later on, but I'm a fan! A lot of your artwork I al ready saw everywhere on the internet! The bitcoin paper bill has it all! The Anonymous mask; I was there when Visa card blocked transactions to WikiLeaks and Anonymous was able to DDOS VisaCard's website with  That was around the same time WikiLeaks decided to also receive btc as donations, at the same time Satoshi Nakamoto said: WikiLeaks has kicked the hornets nest, they're coming for us... And he disappeared, we never heard from him again! On the paper bill you have included everything bitcoin stands for, everything! Burning fiat and the BIS! You have the bulls and the bears, the Citadel, and Shiva on a rocket to the moon (I'm a moonboy for sure!). It's art, one of the most beautiful, thoughtful, thorough complete pieces I've ever seen. Ordering now! The greatest respect for your work, your art, your efforts to school people about this revolution, and to make people think. Much appreciated! These dollars I spend were supposed to buy bitcoin with, but I bought your art! Next month I'll gladly again turn a part of my fiat into bitcoin, this time I turned dollars into art. Thank you!

Invest? Like you want a third party to buy and store it for you? A middle man to charge you extra? Or do you want to buy bitcoin and hold (hodl) and own bitcoin yourself? Why not be your own bank like bitcoin is meant to use? You can buy bitcoin on a lot of exchanges like Kraken, Coinbase, Deribit, and what not. You can buy on platforms like Paxful, Bisq, LocalBitcoins. You can leave smaller amounts on an exchange where you can trade with bitcoin, with larger amounts it's better not to leave your wealth in an online environment for security reaseons, it's better to buy a hardware wallet like Trezor (opensource) or Nano ledger and safely store them yourself, online.

Cyprus is IN the Western world, so it did happen. And I think your trust is misplaced. That it did not happen yet in the US or other places, does not mean it never will. If they need that money, and there's no other way out for them, they'll grab your money faster than a bitcoin transaction. But what you have on the bitcoin blockchain, well, good luck confiscating that. In crisis we will see what the better money is.

Bitcoin is here to stay. It will eat all other fiat currencies, it will become bigger than gold. For that you have to understand it's the best, the hardest, the soundest money ever invented. It's really scarce, only time is scarcer. No one can ever print or make more bitcoin, it's hardcapped on 21 million. Its unseizable, censorship resistant, open and OpenSource, transparant and borderless. You should read The bitcoin standard by Saifedean Ammous, check Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube, and check:  it's a revolution, it's technology and money. It belongs in this list: fire, the invention of the wheel, the book printing press, internet, bitcoin. Learn, buy, hodl, and participate. Welcome and good luck!

The information I referenced to was Jameson Lopp and Andreas Antonopoulos, and I'm glad I'm dumb enough to understand most of what they say and share. And wether bitcoin is money, go talk to Saifedean Ammous, please do. And yes, price will fluctuate, but on a macro level has almost only be rising since 2009 with indeed very big retracements, of which it has always recovered again. And yes, it all could be common knowledge, it's all out there, and yet, when you look around almost no one has nor understands bitcoin, and that's my firm belief that there is immense growth opportunity. And thanks for calling me dumb. Nevertheless I would even call you smart, only because you state that most of your fiat is in btc. Smart move. You're still an asshole for calling random strangers on the interwebz dumb though.

Coinbase is more a bank, remember that. It's fine to get your first buys on. The moment your amounts of btc is becoming a little bit more you have to think about your own hardware wallet (I use Trezor, Nano ledger is the other big name to check). You can keep on buying at Coinbase or any other xchange, and send to your hardware wallet. There are 2 kind of exchanges, those who were hacked and those who are not hacked yet. That's why with bigger amounts of crypto you don't want to use an online (hot) wallet. Great strategy, keep on buying!

Not that simple. For mass adoption we need that everyone will be interested and wants to buy. But when, not if, the next recession hits, who will buy when a big part of the workforce is unemployed and has only debts and no money? Most people will have other needs in case of a recession, they won't suddenly all start to buy bitcoin. But big institutional investors will see it as a great hedge and a store of value, so that will help. Mass hysteria, when everybody wants to have some BTC is not here (yet). In case of a total collapse of fiat money, that's a totally different case, who knows. But I think they can can go on and on for years with devaluation of fiat money. I'm very bullish on bitcoin, just don't know how long it'll take for the rest of the world to  understand the value of bitcoin. I know one thing, everybody who can get some bitcoin now will profit enormously.

Who would down vote a statement telling the truth? Of course they're centralised, and for a lot of companies that's just the right structure for an organisation. Regarding money/currency/store of value it  appears a decentralised peer to peer currency like bitcoin just works better/fairer in its decentralised way and the world is slowly acknowledging that. And I believe there will be a revolution also in certain use cases where Decentralised Anonymous Organisations (DAOs) can handle all kinds of (financial) services. The world of finance (among others) will change with crypto and smart contracts and Blockchains. At the same time I guess you can keep ordering on Amazon for the next coming ages I guess..

It cost money to delve gold (roads, equipment, fuel to get from and to the source etcetera).

Good question. The time of only paying in bitcoin isn't here yet, and to live practical you simply need dollars. Great opportunity, if you find an easy way to convert to USD to do your weekly/monthly payments, have some hand money, and the rest you can leave in BTC. Great way to HODL. I would go with the bigger names in the Industry, Kraken or Coinbase to start. Be careful with smaller or lesser known exchanges. Paxful might be of interest, the have a lot of ways to convert. Might also get more advice from people if they knew what country you're in. Good luck, hope some of this could help you on your way. I know I would like to get paid in btc!

You are so wrong. Yes blame banks and governments. The banks know they lend to much, that's their game! And when it's payback time, they know governments will do anything to pay the banks through taxes and this is what the banks are counting on. The us can only spend so much BECAUSE of the banks lending and printing. If the us went broke 23 trillions of dollars ago, there were no/less wars, no debt, nu US dollar supremacy, a better world. Banks enable the pile of trillions of debt so US can go on spending taxpayers money. The same with every other central bank. Lend, lend more, lend to pay only rent on the loans, and if fail, collect with the taxpayers. It's the central banking system and uncontrolled government spending that goes hand in hand and what I'm hoping to change by longing bitcoin and short the banksters. I trade my fiat for BTC for this. In other words, I short the dollar and euro. Fuck banksters!

@_date: 2019-08-10 17:08:18
Everything comes down to supply and demand. There is no price control. Manipulation can happen, but don't go around calling every price move manipulation. Bitcoin is still in his infancy, early years, so although a multiple billions dollar market all ready, in the grand scheme of things, it's still relatively small (but definitely growing hard). Because of this price can be VERY volatile. This is bitcoin, this is crypto, you're in for one hell of a ride, with moon and Lambo on the horizon. Don't get shaken out, hodl, with everything you've got! Let's go!!
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:06:45

Please be real?  It was not built to fight with Fiat currencies? Have you even read the whitepaper? Why point to a corrupt banking system that need bailouts in the Genesis block? Early core developer Nick Szabo who released another competitive currency BitGold in the '90s? The start of it all with CryptoANARCHISTS and the CypherPunks mailing list? Don't fool yourself. I, and a lot of bitcoiners are here to CRUSH the existing, exploiting, exclusive, corrupt and political printing banking system in charge of money. If bitcoin is to succeed, it will take power away from the central banking system. Ask senator Sherman, he knows what's at stake. It is to attack and defeat the dollar as worldcurrency!   Long bitcoin, short banks! And please, be real! Cheers, I'm out!

He's right though. Bitcoin is going to redistribute wealth an take on the financial system and the powers that be. Blockchain is going to deliver thousands of practical  solutions. The first will definitely have more impact. Money rules the world, bitcoin is going to redistribute that and make it fairer and for the better, I hope. It's The Bitcoin Blockchain with the Bitcoin token that's the revolution, they belong to each other, and till now, it's the only proven Blockchain I would say. And I could call you an idiot, but I choose not to do that..

That's a very conservative estimate. The market cap of gold is around 7 trillion, if btc reaches around the same marketcap 1 btc will be around $350.000,- The thing is, if you understand money, than you could argue bitcoin is in every way better than gold, so it should grow bigger than gold. Except for the history of course, gold goes back  thousands of years, btc 10 years. Than there is the marketcap of all fiat currencies together. If you think that btc is a better money, than it would grow bigger than all fiat currencies together. Only for the simple reason it would make sense to hold btc for the longer term than dollars, euro's of yen. People, institutions, companies and even countries will pour more and more fiat into bitcoin over the years to come. We could than combine the market cap of all gold, and all the fiat money in the world, and than someone better in math should be able to come up with a number. It's probably in the millions per bitcoin or so. We are talking decades here, my first target is 50k late 2020 and 350k late 2024. After that, moon and lambo. Read up on Stock 2 flow, it's mentioned in other comments, and read Saifedean Ammous: The bitcoin Standard. Sounds crazy? Sure! Could it happen? I think so, we have never seen a money like bitcoin, it's all new ground, and exciting!

It might beat BTC as a payment system for now. It might even become successful. Making it easy for the masses to pay across borders. It ain't no crypto though. Btc will be a better investment because of scarcity. They could co exist, and BTC is better in almost every way. Open source, decentralised, censorship resistant etcetera.  It might be that more people learn about crypto because of this shit coin, and might even be good.

There is a lot to read and learn, it's truly diving into the rabbit hole. I must admit I expect a possible drop to 7.5k  (could be wrong though!) but there comes a moment the next bull run really takes off and we will reach a new all time high, of which I expect it to be around 50k 1.5 - 2 years from now. I buy every month, I don't care if I buy at 9k. 7k or 12k, in the long run those will all be good entries. Bitcoin has a 4 year cycle, because of the halving, every 4 year the amount of bitcoin to be mined (new supply) is cut in half (less bitcoin available, price goes up). Next halving is may 2020 and new all time high occurs more and less a year after that.  Every cycle has brought new all time highs, I could not think of a reason why that would not happen again. And yes, bitcoin will be volatile, but it's still the best performing asset of the last decade. If you do not look at all years highs but to all years lows, you will see it's only rising since the Genesis block: 
* **2012 – $4**
* **2013 – $65**
* **2014 – $200**
* **2015 – $185**
* **2016 – $365**
* **2017 – $780**
* **2018 – $3200**
**If you are in it for the long run you can't loose. Just don't get scared of pulbacks of +/- 40%. Don't sell, Hodl! Have fun reading all the interesting stuff about this magical internet money! :-)**

This is bad. If the biggest player (Google) changes its algorithm you want to know what its effects is. Now you've to guess. This way Google makes a decision on what people see or read without transparency in that. No matter what the quality of journalism (not that they're good/bad) or what possible goals the website has, doesn't  matter. They decide for a big part what people see and part of what people think.

Freedom fighters don't like jail, and no human ever will. As a libertarian, Ulbricht viewed the government with suspicion and espoused American ideals of liberty without the interference of the State. While facilitating the trade of narcotics isn’t a typical demonstration of political engagement, Ulbricht’s actions were, it can be argued, an expression of the sort of American patriotism that puts the ideals of the founding fathers ahead of the modern political reality of the United States.

If you don't get it, let it go. Why this agressieve hateful tone? TA has a long history, if you look at charts, you use it. The candles, with high, low and open prices and more were invented more than 150 years ago in Japan. And of course, with sudden events, like the discovery of new oil or whatever influences the price, and can make your analysis obsolete, does not mean you skip the analysis. No one will say that they can predict the price, you just try to estimate the direction where the price will go, and trade on that. No one will be right 100 % of the time. But if you don't like it, don't do it, but that's gambling.

read into what the effect of open source, DECENTRALIZED and censorship resistant money/bitcoin is and what it means. It's resilient in design, if enough people mine and run nodes, no government, hacker, criminal or whatever can attack the network. They can try to fight it buy making a lot of things complicated, but think razzia's in all civilians houses to search for wallets and stuff? Not going to happen. And if you store your seed right, you could memorize it, you can travel the world and no one would know that if you have access to the internet, you could have access to your wealth. You can cross borders with access to millions, inside your head, and no one would know. God, I love the design and future effects of Bitcoin.

That's the beauty, bitcoin can be what I want it to be, for me. And for you, and for everybody that for whatever motivation wants it to be something. It's our money, what we, the people who use it make from it. It is a revolution, a cultural paradigm shift! A global redistribution of wealth. As long as it is open source, decentralized, censorship resistant, deflationary, and the only thing on earth what really has a defenit digital scarcity of 21 million, it's unstoppable! The whole world gets an alternative besides the old financial central banking fiat system. That's powerfull. Weather u use it as a store of value, a payment, it is revolutionary better money, still in his infancy. If you own one bitcoin, years from now, you might be a millionaire then, and you can pay for your coffee in satoshis, buy a house with it and get your salary in it., and get loans in it or with it, whatever. Who needs banks?

5 of the World's Most Devastating Financial Crises | Britannica.com
Abrief description of five of the most-devastating financial crises of modern times. The Credit Crisis of 1772. Boston Tea PartyIllustration of the Boston Tea Party. The Great Depression of 1929–39. The OPEC Oil Price Shock of 1973. The Asian Crisis of 1997. The Dot.com crisis. The Financial Crisis of 2007–08.
 These are just a few, of which the last 5 were in the last century, the time frame you were talking about. And these are only the worst, there have been a lot more. Go tell in Germany in '29 or in recent Zimbabwe or Venezuela that fiat doesn't crash nearly as much nor as bad as crypto and it never will... And look up how much the dollar lost in value in a century, it's about 98% or so less in value, it only is a very slow crash.  So tell me, were is your head at?

Here we go again! From the article: 
The International Monetary Fund says it would be [hard to prevent a sovereign debt crisis in Italy engulfing Spain and Portugal]( The ECB could therefore face a Target2 crisis approaching €1 trillion if Italy’s rebel government sets off a chain reaction with its ‘minibot’ notes - which it claims are needed to cover €52bn of state arrears to Italian contractors and households.
The Bundesbank’s text states that if a country leaves EMU and its central bank defaults on Target2 liabilities, the ECB will have to eat through a series of buffers: first its own capital - dramatic enough -  and then by drawing in money from the remaining central banks on a ‘capital key’ basis.
The logical inference is that this sequence eventually turns into a margin call. German, Dutch, Finnish, or French taxpayers might have to write fat cheques to bail out their central banks. 
&amp; “This is lending on a huge scale that no government has approved. It is covering fundamental imbalances at the heart of the eurozone system, and it can’t go on indefinitely,” he said.
&amp; The Target2 credits entail mounting risks for German taxpayers yet there is no vote to approve this in the German parliament. The Bundesbank hands over the money automatically.
TL:DR: we're fucked!

Ok, thanks, I did not know that, I've still a lot to learn. But I must say that my reason to look into this is to be a part of the network, I understand it helps with decentralizing, the more nodes the better, and with verifying. I don't transact a lot (HODL!) so the main reason is to be a part of the network and to help make it stronger, not so much verifying my own transactions. Never the less, good to learn this part from you, thanks! Don't trust, verify, I get that!

It's about supply and demand. You will find this in any market. With lots of demand: more buyers than sellers, price will rise. With less demand: more sellers than buyers, price will fall. If the apple harvest is bad, there is more demand than supply for apples, the price will rise. If the harvest of apples is insanely good, there will be a lot of supply, and you will probably get two apples for the price of one, apples will be cheaper. The market cap of bitcoin, the total amount of fiat dollars invested in bitcoin is relatively small (+/- $147 billion dollars now)  compared to other markets (stocks, bonds, gold, oil, etcetera) so with relative small amounts of bitcoin that are bought or sold the price will react pretty fast to go up or down, this makes the price of bitcoin volatile. When the market cap will be as big as for example gold, which is around 7 trillion dollars the price will not be as volatile, it will be harder to move the price up or down and it will become less volatile. Bitcoin is young, it's in her infancy, only a decade old. Still from 0 to a marketcap of 147 billion dollar in 10 years is very impressive, it is al ready the best performing asset in the last decade, giving investors a bigger return in profit than any stock, commodity or anything else. Don't get scared off because of the volatility, if you buy and hold it for a few years you will surely (bases on last decade) get a higher return on your investment.

The real question is, what will the market decide what the true value of 1 btc is. And I think it's really undervalued right now. It takes time, but the price will go up enormously in the (near) future, and every halving will give it a boost. It might be partly priced in as you say, for some people who think to know bitcoin, but there are newcomers everyday. It's not priced in enough, just as the real true value. We still have a long way to go, and the only real direction is way up.

It still can be, depends if he wants all the GBP at once or not. If not, he could stretch it out over months/years, by converting little amounts of btc to GBP once in a while. And even with bigger amounts, if you find a buyer at a local P2P exchange, also no worries. It still fits, it is good use case, and there is no reason to think it'll not work. Bitcoin remains a store of value, and a way to transfer wealth across borders. My tip to OP would be the first option, only convert what he needs, the rest will increase in value insanely coming months. It's possible with that amount in btc, in a year, or more, he is richer than most of us here (I guess:-)

Prevent fraud and corruption? I think you're listening to much to him who's name I will not mention.

Yes. Check what the address said. You have bitcoin wallet addresses, Ethereum wallet addresses, etc. You mostly get a warning also, something like: this is a bitcoin address, make sure to only send bitcoin to this address. You get the same warning for let's say for example Ethereum, and probably every other coin. BCH is Bitcoin cash, is another coin! BSV is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, is another coin.

Doesn't matter, it's exactly the point that now there is an alternative to wire money through the traditional banking system. As bitcoin gets more and more adoption it would make sense that with every bigger (emergency/unrest) situation in a country (now big protests in Hong-Kong) , but could be revolution, hunger, war, riots, whatever that more and more bitcoin will prove itself as a pretty damn good way of transporting value across borders. This is what it's made for, among other things. It's a perfect use case. Who cares that you still can wire money, I don't.
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:18:16
But those active stabilization measures fail big time, that's the point. With printing money, low interest, a debt based financial system you get inflation to steal our wealth (the people) and blow bubbles in other assets like for example real estate for the rich, bankers and so on. It's waiting for the next crash, which they will be guilty for, again, which could be The Big one. This financial system with all their so called stabilization measures is exactly the big problem, but you seem to think it works. Bitcoin is in its nature opposing all this, undermining it. I believe it'll work in the future, and a future based on bitcoin could be much more stable, that's the point: it is better money &amp; store of value where we cut out the stealing middleman banksters who are the only ones together with politicians who benefit from this system. And when that happens, where bitcoin is a big part of the financial system, the volatility will also be gone. It's time for plan B, plan Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-08 14:53:42
I appreciate your reaction, and I must admit, I'm no expert, but I do read a lot about our financial system, I think a lot of bitcoin enthusiast do. Also it is in the nature of the people of the financial system to overcomplicate things, not to simplify, unfortunately. A lot of this stuff is complicated. Walk outside and ask people: what is money, and you'll know what I mean.. But back to your post. A lot of government bonds and what not are indeed bought by asset managers, and sure a lot of them work in financial institutions, including big banks and other financial institutions, right? And the same banks and other financial institutions received bail outs, and are receiving LTRO and benefit from QE Right? And they use that money again to by bonds (among other assets) etcetera again, from governments, right? They're all woven into each other, they dine together. They are all part of the problem and one way of the other, they're all involved in the big money ponzi scheme, and they all make sure they benefit, and we'll pay. And yes, I have a problem with banksters lending to much, that was the problem in 2008! Those greedy fucks lend mortgages of half a million dollars to homeless people to buy a house, and when these subprime mortgages failed, the banks took our money to bail them out, private banks, central banks and governments where all complicit in this. And again, that's their game..

Watch it again I would say, and than correct your title of the post, and withdraw your comments.

Still infancy. Everyone who gets in now is also still early. There will be a time when they say: should have bought a piece when it was still around 20k..

I would suggest paxful because they've a lot of ways to convert btc, but check also the big exchanges. And also because you say you are fairly new to bitcoin, I would suggest you take a look at the website at the end of my post, just to learn more about btc. If you find a solution, please update your post, cause I'm curious myself how you solve this. This is actually one the things bitcoin should make easier and cheaper for you, so I hope it turns out to be   the best way for you to take your wealth with you across borders. All the best! 
@_date: 2019-06-10 12:34:22
You are absolutely right, and they can come down on crypto really hard. Let's just hope no government in the world will take that route. But in reality, look at the war on drugs, it's been going on since the '80s, but never was and never will be successful. So yes the can raise hell and make it hard, they won't succeed or win. Let's just hope more reasonable governments will govern in the future, and that no one will ban crypto. I'm not fully confident myself they won't attack crypto with everything they've got.

Study bitcoin, and you will realise the potential growth. This is the next big thing. This thing is going to explode the coming years. Every dollar you put into it will be 10 times as much, in the next year or so, and 100x as much years after that. Even a million USD per bitcoin, in years to come  seams a possibility, who knows. I'll buy as long as I can, I'm actually hoping that it takes time, so I can acquire more before it really lifts off.

Why are you talking BS? He runs a business where in the long run he profits more by being honest and only take the agreed amount and leave the rest for the wallet owner, like he did with me. His cut is 20%. I was happy to pay that, because I had all ready given up on those coins. If he took the whole wallet, nobody would be recommending him, and his business would not have a future. He cracked the password, took his share, send me the password and advised me to empty the wallet and to never use that wallet nor the password ever again. Great job, and he deserves my thanks and appreciation, and not your I don't trust no-one comment. Please don't talk bs and make a fool out of yourself.

@_date: 2019-04-28 17:28:36
Good question. I provided him with 12 combinations of a word, with numbers and punctuation marks. All of them proved to be wrong. So he recovered the password which was totally different from what I thought it was. The password I used was a dictionary word with some numbers. I know now to never choose an excisting word. At the time I did not have a good password policy myself. I learned my lesson. I use a password manager now.
@_date: 2019-04-29 04:58:19
He restores access to wallets, whatever there is in it. There is a list on his site what wallets he possibly can get access to. Btw, there is only BTC. :-)
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:10:18
See his website, I think there are more ways than one. In my case I provided him with the json file, wallet address, and words of which I thought was the password, those where not correct.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin, simple as that. You can safely buy on Coinbase, and I think they are one of the safest around. But as soon as you have more than a couple of hundred dollars there, you should think about a hardware wallet and store them yourself. The exchanges that have been hacked are countless. You have 2 kind of exchanges, those that have been hacked, and those that not have been hacked yet. And what if they don't hack Coinbase but your pc and/or phone. If you, your pc or your Coinbase account gets hacked, Coinbase insurance funds will do nothing for you. Use Coinbase to buy and possibly to trade, but move larger amounts of btc to your Trezor (OpenSource) or Nano ledger and keep a metal seed phrase in at least 2 different places. Good luck and welcome!

@_date: 2019-09-23 16:32:53
The inventor was Satoshi Nakamoto, it's still not known if that was a he, a she, or a group of people. He dropped the bitcoin white paper online in 2009, and coded the Blockchain, protocols and what not. This was an open source project and he got help from a lot of people, and it's still in active development. When one of the developers was asked by the CIA to talk about bitcoin, around the same time WikiLeaks was cut out off normal payments. They opened a bitcoin wallet and from that moment they accepted bitcoin. That was the moment we heard last from Satoshi Nakamoto. He mailed: WikiLeaks has kicked the hornets nest, they will be coming for us..... No-one ever heard of Satoshi Nakamoto again. And the rest is history..

Indeed, you're on to something. Time and bitcoin are the only things which are really, really scarce. There will never be more bitcoin, only less (after they're all mined around 2140!!). The more you learn, the better you understand. This is a good start:

Look at all those comments here. Fuck them. Ross did more for bitcoin and freedom than any of you! Free Ross! And no he is never convicted for hiring a hitman. I can hardly think of anyone undergoing this level of injustice, this crazy life sentence without chance on parole. SilkRoad gave bitcoin the chance to grow outside the eyes of the world.

@_date: 2019-09-29 21:30:39
Not everyone is a big investor. A lot of bitcoiners save what they can miss every month. Say they put aside $50 to $500, I think a lot of people do that. Only bitcoiners save the same amount by buying bitcoin with it. It's more like saving instead of investing, or it feels like that. Of course it's both, just make sure you never have to sell at a dip or a bottom. Not everyone has a pile of cash to invest with, more like small till decent amounts over time. And you still need your fiat for every day life: rent or mortgage, groceries and what not.

For the first time ever there is an alternative, never happened. They can coexist for years, but history tells people simply will choose the hardest money there is, over time. And that ain't no easy to print fiat money! And those in the broader financial services, who will adapt will survive. DeFi, or Decentralised Finance is here to stay and bloom. This gives a lot of opportunities for old and new. Time will tell. My bet is definitely on bitcoin. And for I will shed no tear for a bank going bankrupt, or the centralised banking system to die. With bitcoin I've my own private bank in my pocket, and so could all the people around the globe. It's still early..

And for the guy above, give me $1000,- are you responsible for what I do with it?? If you're an xchange or firm then you have to do KYC, but you're still not responsible for what the receiver of bitcoin does whit it. And besides, the fact that you can transact without agreeing to some arbitrary rules of a government who doesn't gets bitcoin is the power of bitcoin. You don't need to do shit.

Borrowing money to trade, that's not really smart. Get up, and dca you bitcoins, you can still have a really bright future, we are all still early. But you have to get your shit together. Lesson 1 is not to invest more than you are willing to loose. You not only did invest more than you are willing to loose, you even borrowed for that! Lesson 2 is that YOU, and only you are fully responsible for every trade, and outcome. Don't blame others, or whales, or the market, or whatever. Take full responsibility for every trade you make..
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:08:56
Selling would be the dumbest thing to do. Look at a weekly or monthly chart. Look at the 4 year cycle. Look how far we are from the last top. Look at the hashrate. I get the feeling you invest without learning. Go learn and hodl. Check out  Only time is scarcer than bitcoin, nothing else. If you sell, I buy, and every smart investor in the world is on the buying and accumulation site. Pick your side. Selling means putting your trust in fiat also, good luck with that.

Do small trades when you just begin, you'll loose, learn first! Good luck!

1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin. Fiat money like the dollar will collapse against bitcoin, logic states that over time you will need more and more dollars to buy bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the only money with a hard cap on supply, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, no more. In the future only time will be scarcer than bitcoin. So you have a new form of money where no one, no banks or government can change the supply like the Fed or ECB does with printing. It's decentralised, no one is in charge except math and code. It's censorship resistant. It's borderless, it's open, everybody can participate by buying, holding, selling or spending bitcoin. It's the best money ever. Check some Andreas Antonopoulos vids on YouTube, he does a great job explaining. Or read The bitcoin standard by Saifedean Ammous and check:

 All fundamentals are great, BTC moves in 4 years cycles were we can spend months at the bottom in between the old and the new all time highest price. Don't get distracted, learn about the coin, buy and keep on buying, and hold on to it! Good luck &amp; have fun this ride!

OK. Good for you, you've tried Bitcoin! I agree this seems too much. Next time indeed, like others say, check before transaction what fees you can pay, the more fee you pay the faster it will transact. So you have a choice. I agree this amount of fees you paid seems too much, check it better next time and see if you can lower it. Don't let this experience hold you back from btc. Learn about, use it, like you did, en hodl it. In the end, it is better money!

Looking for an answer also, for family in another country. I have no problems acquiring or selling BTC living in EU. But I wonder, how will people without access to banking turn BTC into local currency? I can sell on a exchange and withdraw fiat to my bank account. But how will someone without a bank account do this? Localbitcoin is not an option in every country. I want to know how people in other countries than the West tackle this, because banking the unbanked sounds great, but how to go at this in a practical way? Thanks all in advance. And good luck to the OP from Algeria!
@_date: 2019-05-18 08:31:35
The freedom bitcoin can deliver to people does not match with restricting the amounts people can sell. With much more adoption it will become harder to move the price that much, so it will happen less in the future. Get used to it, and have fiat ready when price drops, and don't sweat when price drops, it will recover.
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:07:14
Bitcoin and crypto and Blockchain is in very early stages. While it is possible that someone comes op with something better which the market values more it is in my opinion not very likely to happen. Big tech like Facebook, Google and more rose up from the era of internet in the beginning. They're so big now, it will not be easy to come up with a better, more used, thus more valued Facebook or Google like competitor. I see bitcoin as King for the next decades at least. Sure there will be others, but there's only one king.

Warren Buffet is heavily invested in Banks, if they were not saved with taxpayers money he would not be the great investor that he is now to most people. He is a fraud and a parasite. His gains are payed for by the public. He is against bitcoin and crypto because of this. He is not the best investor in the world. He is a criminal helping the banking cartel. Insanely rich, yes. Just like most bankers. And bankers are criminals and parasites who are stealing from the public for a few hundred years. Bitcoin is the first money that can change this. This is our money, it belongs to all of us who dare to short bankers and fiat by trading it into BTC. Short bankers &amp; long bitcoin!

You have NO excuse to not be buying bitcoin! You will do well! Must be a great place to work. And if you think it's sketchy, talk to your customers. Say you don't get it, most of them probably love to talk about bitcoin. If not, please respect their privacy, they're probably doing sketchy things. And educate yourself, read, learn, use and hodl.

If bitcoin would truly undermine the dollar, also the world currency, not only financing the US would become much harder, but they literally lose power over other countries and economies. The economic power of the US/dollar is enormous. This could change. This guy sees it as it is. Bitcoin could undermine governments, financial and other systems, the Fed, and redistribute wealth in a total other way. Bitcoin makes them lose power and control. An end to printing and unsustainable debt. There is better money now!

I think they are great! I want one, or a few. Can't get enough of cool pictures with that shiny "B". Seriously, you need something to represent this magical internet money! I want to print it on my shirts and coffee cup and more! Use the coin bro! The time will come that people get it..

Does not look good, how do people end up there. Maybe a bit of research before investing? How many btc's you had there? I don't know if they're legit or not, I hope you get your funds back. But reading a few pages on there website I see a lot of spelling mistakes, this would've worried me. See what's on the page of their founder Neil Barrington: "One day I understood, that our financial future is cryptocurrecne. I decided to make this future closer to us, and in 3 years I put together a team a team, and we created Blokcoin Exchange. But I made it for YOU." THEY CAN'T EVEN SPELL CRYPTOCURRENCIES!!

Whoa take it easy! Is it not great to have choises? You're on the right track, great that you make the effort for starting to try better money! I can't speak for all the players you mentioned, but I use Kraken en Coinbase, they both serve me good. At least you do your research before throwing fiat at the wrong players. And fees, yes they are important but when the next bull run really takes off, you won't care, you will only be smiling.. welcome and cheers!

We want mass adoption. Stop dragging drugs into it. Just don't. Simple as that.

Best time to buy was 2010. Second best time to buy is now. You're not late to the party. Buy!

I don't know, I don't have an iPhone, but google is your friend. If you did not make the transaction yet, than you have all the time to figure this out. If you want to make a transaction from your app/wallet on your iPhone, you should be able to adjust the fees in the app/wallet on your iPhone.

You should have been buying at least since January, every week or month. And keep doing that. Short term: correction is possible, dip is possible, moon is possible, no one knows for sure. In the long term, you do not care if you bought the exact dip, only that you still bought on time. Buy, buy, buy..

Really fun to watch! Makes me feel good. Imagine how big btc and crypto sometimes looks, especially for most of us, following all the crypto news etcetera. There is a really strong base. But we have still a loooong way to go. What we see here is an idea of how much the value and appreciation of btc still can grow. We are still in the infant years. This makes me soo bullish.

Lol, he saw the price recovery and deleted all his comments. Coward! Lol
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:09:08
Can confirm, he is legit. Best advise here, he helped me also recovering a wallet recently!

So if I use Brave on my Windows machine to go to the the Trezor site this would imply risk?
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:01:43
Lol missed your reply, I'm sorry. I'm not offended by anything. But if you state that crypto ATMs main reason to excist is drugs you are very narrow minded and you don't help the mass adoption of crypto. You sound like mass media after they discovered Silk Road. There are many reasons to use an ATM besides drugs, and they should be used by way more people, for way many purposes, my dear redditor for 5 weeks..

To everyone still trusting banks it seems they get big fines, they receive punishment, and everyone can go on trusting the banks. I would like to know for every fine they get, what did they earned by doing it. I know for sure that the profit outweigh the fine. But these figures should get out in the open. You only read about the fines, not about the profit they made with that particular criminal activity. Banksters will be banksters. Name them, shame them. We're all still paying for the 2008-2015(?) Bail outs with tax payers money.

Looks like I have to do some reading. Reviews look good. You liked it? I just started with The Creature from Jekyll Island by Edward Griffin, about the Federal Reserve. Someone should create a reading list with good books for people interested in (better) money, and money alternatives, crypto, bankers, etcetera. Thanks for the book tip!

This is the guy you need, thank me later!

Immediately dragging drugs into it. Why? You sound like mainstream media after they discovered Silk road. I would try the ATM just for trying, and a lot of people most have use for it besides drugs. If we want mass adoption there must be plenty reasons to use that ATM than only for buying drugs..
