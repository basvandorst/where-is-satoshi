If you've got a large gain this year, you'll probably want to go to specialist. Bitcoin income is difficult and there can be more to itm

Yup, along with a few other reasons. Most companies and most High income individuals know the IRS is watching them like a hawk so they try to do whatever they can to stay legal, although they will do whatever they can to legally reduce their tax burden. 
I've got a degree in Accounting and Finance. And honestly, I just applied to a bunch of different places.

Yup. FBAR isn't a tax form and it doesn't affect your taxes. It's just telling the Treasury Dept what foreign holdings you have in order to assist FinCEN. You're not paying taxes on it (although, you are required to pay capital gains tax when you exchange it for another currency). You're not going to have the assets seized unless you're actually doing something illegal with the money. Anyone with foreign investments already know about this and file it already.

If it's a financial instrument and your total value overseas is above $10,000, you need to report. They haven't specifically said it's required for cryptos yet, but I encourage it. If you have a large amount, though, you should be seeing a specialist.

For real, if they actually want to keep Bitcoin alive, they need to pay their goddamned taxes and report their accounts. Hiding it will just bring the government down on them.
And, hey, if Bitcoin does end up crashing, they can report the capital loss and report up to $3,000 yearly (they can also file for a refund on other year's taxes up to 3 years back and 17 years forward).

You don't have to report it as taxable income until the gain is realized. You still have to report that you're holding it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:12:11
I'm assuming it'll be treated like other financial instruments in that you won't recognize the gains until the sale, but I'm not guaranteeing this advice.

Plus, being illegal, the supply of alcohol went down a ton. For that analogy to work, the entire supply of bitcoins would have to be seized and mining made much harder.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:51:05
You definitely should. Worst that could happen is that it's just not accepted, unless you're actually doing illegal shit with it.

You can claim it until you have deducted the loss fully. The intention is so you can't claim passive losses to entirely offset your income.
If you have passive losses of $3,000 this year, you report a passive loss of $3,000. If you have a passive loss of $6,000 this year and your passive income is $0 next year, you report $3,000 loss this year and $3,000 next year. If you have a $6,000 loss this year and $3000 gain next year, you report $3,000 loss this year and passive income of $0 next year.
A while back, people would use passive losses to offset active gains. They made these rules to prevent people from doing that.

Top 10% is usually still standard income (going to work, sole proprietor, s corp, etc.). Top 1% is more passive gains (stocks, bonds, appreciating assets). Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than standard income.

Np. I spent about a year researching and studying the Federal Reserve, monetary policy, money supply, and the Financial Crisis of 07-09. Then another six months performing corporate tax work with a Fortune 100 international company. Pretty much every international account is legal.

Let me give you some background first.
Years back, big companies and many very wealthy people would use passive loss as a loophole to not pay taxes. They'd basically put a small amount of money into a fake business, give it huge debts, and then say "oh no! I lost lots of money this year!" They'd then report huge capital losses on their returns which would offset their income.
The government put lots of laws, rules, and regulations into place to stop this. One of those was to limit annual passive loss at $3,000. However, this meant that some people would experience huge passive losses (say, a company you owned stock in went under). In order to actually allow these losses to be recognized, they allowed you to claim the loss against passive gains you report both in the past and in the future.
Let's make an example: 
Between 1997-1999, you report $10,000 in capital gains. Then in 2000, you report $200,000 in capital loss. Between 2001-2017, you once again have $10,000 per year in capital gains.
In the end you've ended up with no gain or loss. However, if you couldn't carry your loss, you'd end up with taxable income of $197,000 (10,000 per year minus the 3,000 max capital loss). 
You'd be in a pretty shitty situation, wouldn't you? At 25%, you would have paid $49,250 in taxes. 
Since you're allowed to carry it 17 years forward and 3 years back, you can subtract your capital loss from other year's income, in the end, effectively paying zero tax.

Sure, if you can prove it was stolen and you no longer have it in your possession.

To be fair, those using safe havens are still required to report the accounts, at which point it's a question on if the US can tax it. Of course, some of those do go unreported, and that itself is illegal. If you've got more than $10,000 total in assets in foreign financial institutions, you are requested to file an FBAR, as per RICO requirements.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:11:25
Sure, in the same way you can bury a gold bar in a foreign country.
You'll not be able to use them unless you repatriate it or renounce your citizenship and move to that country though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:46
I'm only referring to if it's held overseas.

The redeemer would be the exchange you go to in order to cash out your bitcoins for USD.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:52:43
Currently? You're only required to report it as property on your tax forms. You're not required to file an FBAR. If at any point this year you have more than $10,000 in Bitcoin stored in an overseas institution, I do recommend it, since it won't hurt you and the FBAR is a rather simple form. Plus, it'll prepare you if they do require it in the future. Accidental failure to file is a met with a fine up to $10,000 per account, whereas intentional is $100,000 or 50% of the account's balance, generally whichever is greater.
Don't worry too much about the bill being passed. Bitcoin has gotten to the size that governments will start looking at it, especially since major institutions are taking part. The government would either ban it or recognize it and this is a huge step towards recognition.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:57:01
Not entirely sure on Sole Prop rules since it's filed as personal income.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:42:15
Assuming the safe haven nation has treaties with the US or with another country participating, the government can determine who the true owner is. It is next to impossible for anyone else, though. Most owners of those accounts are using them for legitimate business/tax avoidance purposes (avoidance is different than evasion). 
Most of the foreign loopholes have been closed or are in the process of being closed. There's really no political gains for officials to keep them open - public opinion is deadset against real loopholes and no amount of campaign donations can really sway this enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:04:53
Right, but for you to have legal access to it as an American citizen, it'll have to be repatriated (although, technically, as a citizen you'll have to pay taxes once it's exchanged for any other currency or crypto). 
I forgot to mention that America is weird with personal taxes. If you work and live overseas, you're still taxed on the income by the IRS even if the company you work for is foreign and you don't set foot in America the whole year. 
Now, technically, you could just file for zero taxes. If the coins are stored overseas in a country that doesn't have a financial reporting treaty with the US, they'll never really know. But this is illegal, so I'm not gonna recommend it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:21
That's because the law hasn't been passed yet. Once it is, Bitcoin will be treated as a financial instrument.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:31:34
I think you know what I mean and how the government views it.

BTC to USD. 
It's just making it so US based exchanges are treated like banks in that they're required to share account information with the IRS (and if a warrant is issued, with other agencies). You'll also be required to file an FBAR if you have funds in foreign exchanges in excess of $10,000. 
With this classification, it's also opening the door to potential federal insurance (or even larger scale private insurance) on US based reserves, which can prevent an exchange from stealing your currency. It's also a step towards legitimizing cryptocurrencies. 
However, depending on what happens with the future of cryptos, you may begin to see reserve requirements on these institutions. Currently, banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their reserve open for withdrawals (usually 7-9%). Occasionally, they'll also be required to deposit a bit of it with the Reserve in order to control money supply. These policies are designed to help keep banks from going under because they put too much of their funds at risk. 
I spent about a year/year and a half researching the Federal Reserve/monetary supply and the FBAR requirements so let me know of any questions/concerns or if you believe I've said something wrong.

Do you know what an asset is?
An asset is something with value. That's it. 
Your car is an asset. A piece of cake is an asset. Your dollar bills is an asset.
You're going around talking about a corporation. Corporations have assets. And guess what? If you look at their BS, you'll see their very first asset: **CASH**.
