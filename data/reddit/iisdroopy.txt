Hmmm they should accept solarcoin....... HEY IF YOUR READING THIS YOU SHOULD ACCEPT SOLARCOINS.......
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:33:55
Before you judge mabey you should read up on the coin, it has a purpose and is given out for free to anyone who produces solar power  
@_date: 2014-05-30 01:35:03
Thats understandable When I said accept mabye I should have worded that different, although it can be traded it is ment to give out as an incentive to people who produce solar energy
