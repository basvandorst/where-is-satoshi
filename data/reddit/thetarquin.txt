Awesome gift, OP.
Just a heads up: if the "13 word poem" is a poem that appears anywhere on the Internet (i.e. is a poem from an existing corpus of any language), it's probably insecure.
See  for details.

Exactly.  Sig || GTFO

A PGP key associated with an email Satoshi didn't use proves exactly nothing.  I could register my own PGP key and start using satoshinakamoto
The PGP key is null evidence.

Folks, this whole thing is pretty simple:
Sig || GTFO
Unless and until he signs a message with the private key matching a public key known to be associated with Satoshi, we should assume he's a fraud.

Ah, right.  I'd forgotten I was on the Internet where cheap insults count as arguments.
Enjoy your emotional masturbation, champ.  Let me know when you're interested in actually having a discussion.

Missing: any place where I or OP called him a hero.  He was a human being, and I'm not trying to mythologize him.
It's okay to be inspired by mere human beings who are fallible and mortal.

At minimum, though, what he did represents a fairly serious responsible disclosure breach.  He was only a quick google search away from  which details their responsible disclosure process and bug bounty.
He chose to post on Reddit instead.

When it comes to BTC, I'm pretty casual.  Having read the Hearn post and this, I'm left with the following impression.
Hearn came with shit-talking and metrics.
Cohen came with shit-talking.
In that instance the guy who has metrics wins, because that's what matters.  It also doesn't help that Cohen didn't address Hearn's metrics.
This isn't to say Hearn's right and Cohen's wrong (I haven't spent enough cycles on understanding BIPs and such to have a trustable opinion on that), but if Cohen really wants to win this argument, he should understand that he's losing the technical non-experts by not backing his words up with data.

Your comment sounds like boos coming from the cheap seats to me.
How about because he was a free-culture activist hounded to death by an unjust and uncaring system that wanted to destroy him primarily because he resisted and refused to conform?

I honestly try not to speculate too much about Satoshi's identity. I will say, Dr. Cerf is certainly smart enough and driven enough to be Satoshi.  He definitely has a keen enough understanding. And he certainly understands the real-world practical engineering principles well enough.  So yes, if you're looking for someone with all the right skills and capabilities, Dr. Cerf definitely meets them.
But the Satoshi that you can know is not the true Satoshi. We're better off with Satoshi anonymous and he/she/they clearly wish to remain anonymous, at least for the time being.  I'm in the camp that we should let them be and not trouble ourselves overly much with their identity.

Not directly related to the video, but Vint Cerf is one of the nicest, most intelligent human beings I've ever had the privilege of meeting. We were at the same table at a cyber-security gala a few years ago (he was there for good and noble reasons, I was only there because I was friends with a sponsor).  He struck me as empathetic, and exceedingly smart, but also uncommonly thoughtful.  He was one of those rare individuals who, when asked a question, seemed to always give it genuine due care and thought before responding.
Truly a wonderful human being, regardless of what you think of his technical analysis.

Seems to me to be calling a spade a spade.
What's with your vitriol for him, though?  Why hate on him?

To put it in perspective, global hash rate right now is 400 Peta-hashes per second.  Assuming efficient implementations, that's roughly 2 zettaflops.
The tianhe-2 super computer does 54 petaflops at peak power.  So the bitcoin network is roughly 40000 times faster than the fastest supercomputer on the planet.
EDIT: I accidentally an order of magnitude.

This is an incredibly important point and one that most people forget or elide.  BTC brokers feel like normal banks in operation, but they're really just key escrow / buying agents.

If you haven't watched Ryan Castellucci's talk from DefCon last year, I highly recommend it: 
He created BrainFlayer did some really interesting analysis on attacks on these types of wallets.

Whoa, wait.  Okay, crazy idea here guys. What if we put MONEY on blockchain?!
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:01:21
Huh, have you tried contacting them? That not only seems like a possible fair trade violation, but it's also in contravention of their own stated policies: 
Might be a mistake or might be more to the story.

No, I'm arguing that markets are efficient.  But that the iOS jailbreak you reference is not a market.  The entire 0-day market is tiny enough as is, but the predictive/Bayesian value of a single data point is negligible.
It's close to zero information.
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:07:46
Impressive site for a 15y/o! It looks like he may have some CSS layering issues.  On my browser (Chrome 46), each header image loads one after another when switching tabs, which gives kind of a weird experience.
But other than that, the web is cool.
The only other suggestion I'd make is that there appear to be some missing links.  E.g. the Trezor mini review tells you to "click here" to read a comparison of different hardware wallets, but there's no link.
It also mentions a larger/full Trezor review, but lacks a link.
Looks like a great start!  Best of luck to your bro!

Either the story about the "buddy at Google" is bullshit, or your buddy will pretty soon be ex-Google.  Google has a top-notch security team (source: worked with some of them before) and they take data custodianship very seriously.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:00:59
Dozens of teams is a small part of InfoSec, it was for a company intentionally trying to garner PR (after they rebranded from a previous 0-day broker), and it was a fixed (not bid) price for a single event.
No part of that resembles a market robust enough to make predictions from.
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:14:55
This is misleading.  Patents are constructed of a number of "claims" (basically assertions about what the proposed patent will do/cover).  The JPMorgan patent application had 175 total CLAIMS rejected, but (based on coverage I can find) was only submitted twice.  Once initially and once for amendment.
That being said, the 175 claims rejected represented EVERY CLAIM that JPMorgan tried to make.  Meaning that with an IP regime as horribly broken as the US, JPMorgan's lawyers couldn't even float a single claim, despite trying twice.
This displays either unexpected competence on the part of the USPTO or stunning lack of skill and understanding on the part of JPMorgan's IP team.
Either way, good for Bitcoin, good for the US, good for the world.
EDIT: a word.

"This open technology is insanely useful and great, my 'business' couldn't exist without it."
"If my business didn't exist, the price would collapse."
If he'd taken any decent Econ 101 courses, he'd realize how ludicrous these statements are.
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:21:12
IANAL and all: but that seems like horseshit.
If you haven't been physically served papers, I wouldn't worry about it.  If you are worried, in most areas tons of lawyers will do free consults.

Additional confirmation: just successfully funded my MS account with BTC.  It was flaky (QR failed to load on first try), but refreshed and went through the workflow again and it worked.
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:41:56
That's not how economics or efficient markets work.  Markets are efficient at scale, not at every point on the margin.  If there was a well-populated, high-volume iOS 0-day market with a reliable ~$1 million dollar bid price, THEN you could make the statement that "an attacker would be better off selling his 0day than stealing &lt;$1 million dollars equivalent of Bitcoin from some number of sources, adjusted for risk of capture and punishment".
That's a LOT different than "someone once paid $1 million as a stunt for an iOS Chrome 0Day, therefore store $999,999 worth of Bitcoin in your wallet and you'll be safe."

Good on them for covering customer losses with no drama and no fuss.

Yeah, and every time there's a breach, I have to get new eyes and fingers for all my different accounts.
Frankly, I'm running out of places to hide the bodies.

How would you actually implement that system?

Out of curiosity: what are they made out of? What concerns are there for, e.g. oxidation or weathering under long term storage?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:51:47
I think this is a good thing.  Each new bubble brings a new wave of enthusiasts.  Those who find something here to interest them will stay and add to the next round of discussion and meaningful analysis and help Bitcoin become a more viable currency.
Those that aren't interested in Bitcoin as anything more than a volatile commodity will get washed away again when the tide recedes and we're back down at more stable levels.
Net positive, I think.
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:00:39
The problem is that all of these controls are located client side.  That means a sufficiently sophisticated attacker can bypass them by tampering with hardware or software.
They rely on the fact that the amount of time/effort required to circumvent them would be more profitably spent elsewhere (e.g. creating and distributing novel ransomware).
The lesson?  Whoever they are, the attacker has a budget. You job isn't to make the attack impossible, but to make it too expensive to be worth executing.
