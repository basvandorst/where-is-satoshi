That’s a new one to me, mine was verified quickly. Have you tried linking the bank account directly to GDAX?

It’s is as valuable as it’s demand. Money doesn’t give it its value. We as users create its value when we buy and introduce new users to buy.

Use GDax. Sign in with your Coinbase account, deposit from your Coinbase account (free), send bitcoins anywhere (free)

Only if you have taken it out and put it into your bank as real money does it count as a gain. IRS.gov is where you can find all of your documentation. Or you could use a service like Turbotax or something similar to automate the process.

You can deposit directly to gdax without a fee if you use your bank account, it does take a week, or a card for a fee, it just depends on your situation i guess. I only use Coinbase now to quickly check prices.

I’m in Colorado and Coinbase and GDAX work fine for me.

Just pay your taxes and you have nothing to worry about

I actually work at a local station and am currently working on an explainer video to help the mainstream viewers get in touch.
