Never said that. Bankers need competition like bitcoin so if they try to fuck over the people, then they will lose.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:48:28
The economy we live in is a joke. Completely unsustainable.
Bitcoin will help us.

Gold is not a replacement for FIAT. Gold has a mcap of 7/8 trillion USD. Bitcoin a better version of gold hence it should have a higher market cap than gold given enough time. Bitcoin is undervalued right now.
Your to focused on the FIAT replacement stuff. :)
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:34:26
My view is that it will provide the much needed competition in the "money/currency" space to stop governments from their corruption and hyperinflating regimes.
When people are pissed off with their rulers and see they have an alternative options, people will remove power from their rulers by using other value transfer mechanisms (e.g. Bitcoin). Money is power so why would citizens want to give their rulers that control over them?
One could argue that in a country with corruption, hyperinflation and dictator rulership people will use bitcoin as a FIAT REPLACEMENT because the benefits outweigh the costs.
Also when negative interest rates kicks in do you think people want to be charged a fee just for keeping their money in a bank. Hell no!
Just because you don't need it, it doesn't mean that others in corrupted hyperflated countries don't need it too.
Bitcoin cannot be confiscated from you. Your banks account can be blocked, your assets can be seized. Bitcoin is freedom from the controls imposed on us.

@_date: 2019-07-19 12:40:54
Not delusional. Depends on what your thoughts are on what money is/should be.
You're deluded in thinking that there can't be other perspectives that may be better or worse.

You can withdraw everything when you want.
You get the interest because your crypto is lent out. The borrowers have to place a collateral which is safer than being with any normal bank because they do not not do that. 2008 financial crisis .... regulatory reforms requirijg banks to hold more cash and liquid assets incase of bank runs.
Tested the platform with abit of money and its amazing!
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:41:26
All I am saying is that I would be happy to pay a transaction fee rather than allowing the central bankers manipulate the economy with their fiat printers and monetary policy for their own gain.

You should cover amount bought and also time.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:06:00
Nvr gna apn
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:44:32
You buy when sell pressure had evaporated which is the point.
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:22:27
No. Normally 99% you will feel like shit. Just Hodl.
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:31:17

Remember Bitcoin is long term HODL. Never doubt it. :)
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:22:25
It's good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:49:34
FYI, we are aware that there will be some negative momentum ahead and we are all waiting for reversal indicators to reload our bags.
Yours sincerely, the smart bitcoiners.

@_date: 2019-10-09 17:15:24
200 DMA is generelly quite significant in the markets. Throughout every bullrun, price was above this level. When below, it means bear market.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:03:28
Exactly. Same thing when gold had its massive drawdown from 2008/9 financial crisis. Every needs fiat to pay bills.
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:40:03
Only invest money you can afford to lose. Best to split that $200 dollars in 52 portions and buy weekly for a year. So like $4 every week.
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:40:32
Study now then buy after a good while of research.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:08:04
Also more hashrate does not neccesarily imply more miners. But we know that new miners are entering the scene.
@_date: 2019-10-29 23:01:33

You are the hero we all need but don't deserve.
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:07:11
If 5 miners all got 1800 BTC, they would be less pressured to sell all at once because they would be able to cover costs.
Now if there were 1000 miners, less would get the rewards which means if they do by chance get the block reward. They would probably need to sell most of it to cover costs.
@_date: 2019-10-27 22:28:38
I wish it died to $1k so i could refill XD
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:04:33
Everyone will lol
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:45:14
I also agree with you
@_date: 2019-10-27 22:31:50
No one knows that is relative.
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:17:41
I could find your wallet

I want it to go down more and buy the fuck out of the 8k to 9k range
@_date: 2019-10-27 22:32:17

You can literally hit download on your windows desktop. Dont need to do anything else. (Besides opening port 8333 on router settings)
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:13:30
Hodling gives better returns because everyone misses the few big moves within the year. Eg everyone fucked up with the recent 40% upmove.
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:09:58

@_date: 2019-10-27 19:56:44
Yes sir. Buy a ledger nano s which costs around $50. Alot of people use it. Read instructions properly :).
Some reccomend a trezor device but never used one.
@_date: 2019-10-27 09:22:22
Because it was
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:03:25
It just means more sell pressure.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:55:23
Everything will dip. Have cash on hand
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:12:19

And when you will never need those scammy fiat coins.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:25:05
Note on india. Some banks have issued max withdrawal amounts so customers can barely get any of their money out. And we wonder why indian banks are trying to block crypto transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:50:57

Coinbasepro . Submit a limit buy order for less fees
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:25:52
GBTC and BTC doesnt always move the same amount in % terms.
I mean you should buy actual BTC via exchanges and and store it on your cold storage device. Dont hold it on online wallet or an exchange because both are hackable. Hope that helps.

@_date: 2019-10-22 20:00:31
It seems to me that people have purchased too much bitcoin. When the next economic downturn comes everyone will be mass selling their bitcoin into fiat, crashing the price 90%.

The fomo guys were asleep. The institutions pumped it. You always buy the big dips. Low risk high reward. Simple. Bullish divergences were forming similar to the ones from jan to march this year. Big players jumped the gun first before everyone else.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:32:50
I also agree with you
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:22:36

Bro im running a full node and posting lots of macro economic material. I have got atleast 10 people into bitcoin. Chill. Plus I work for a crypto company.
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:14:10
Use celsius.network free transfers internal and external of the app. Send it over to exchange and convert to fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:04:07
But then mining difficulty lower then more moners come back and we go to equilibrium. And by the time all bitcoins are mined the hashsingpower will be at the ath anyway.

You must be happy to have your investment be in the red by 50% and ready to hodl. Can you handle that?
If not. Then lets say you have $1000, just spread out a buy order every sunday for the year. Thats like 20 buying days. So $1000/20= $50. Buy $50 of BTC every sunday this year.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:18:24
HODL bitcoin is the world currency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:12

Low fees. Um no
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:51:01
Dollar cost average in with an amount you are willing to lose maybe $250 every week until the end of the year?
BTC will be over $100k within a few years anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:44:20
Use it as a store of value
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:21:57
Exactly. Once the linear adoption reaches the tipping point, price will catch up exponentially. It will be so fast that most will miss it and that is why you HODL (obviously dont buy at the top of the market cycle).
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:16:01
We all know its worth a $20 trillion marketcap and soon the world will realise.

True true bitcoin is not mature right now so jokes are acceptable.

The market is driven by supply and demand. When you cut inflation by half... that is a big hit to supply... also some miners will stop mining... so less sell pressure.

@_date: 2019-04-14 23:12:29
True. But there are plenty ready to buy BTC but unsure of whether the price will drop further so they hold off buying. These guys may FOMO in... Also the bitcoin search volume on google is very high ATM so that could induce some more new retail investors to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:20:09
U sure
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:46:45

"If it is not spent, how can it keep its value"... You are wrong here.. More selling of bitcoin means prices will go down (read about money velocity). Less selling of bitcoin means prices will go up.
Fiat money (e.g dollars) can be endlessly printed and can mean the value of your dollar will buy you less goods (e.g. milk &amp; bread) in the future because these goods are limited. Bitcoin has a limited supply which means if more dollars are printed, theoretically the value of bitcoin relative to the dollar should increase.
See zimbabwes hyperinflation issue because of their money printing.

If macro economic forces prevail that will help the BTC price surge then the cycle will shorten. But yes I think you are right.

Bitcoin is a movement. Sell some if you want but HODL most of it!
Govt fiat makes you poorer and watch when they kick in negative interest rates. You will become poorer even faster because you will be paying your bank 2% just to hold you money.
Good luck.

The current monetary system is a cult and your not going to win from it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:58:25
Look just hodl your BTC and DCA in and earn your fiat from your job and live life. No need to sell unless you need fiat cash badly.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:58:19
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:58:38
I will trade the opposite of your advice. See you in a week.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:23:54
All in late in the high 4ks
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:34:55
Id say wait for it to stay above 100k then you arr very safe
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:05:25
Dude is a moron
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:06:47
U r right
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:54:10
Using past price action from 2015/2016 had a parabolic move then continued higher after the retracement which we have had already.
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:26:44
Well they better say it hopped UP $1000 just now.
Wait until July when we break $10k, everyone gonna lose their minds!
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:08:23
Retrace completed off to 7200

@_date: 2019-05-31 12:35:51
Its taking over slowly...
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:42:20
Id expect some retracement to $6.5k
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:49:12
Try celsius network they pay you interest on your crypto, kinda like staking
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:49:29
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:41:17
Tell us how it is done please
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:55:00
Lol just waiting for the bubble to burst.
They lie though. Factor in real estate prices and inflation is real. The components they use for inflation and GDP just help them fit the narrative they went so they can siphon all the wealth. 
Read Mariana Mazzucatos book called 'The value of everything". Great read.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:51:11
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:47:35
I didnt know for ages lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:27:52
Then don't hold a position and make comments.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:12:41
Kevin is great, watched lots of his videos. But the fact that he doesn't know yet makes me even more bullish. Wait until he reads about the tech when the price goes over $50k, he is going to run and tell all his $billionaire friends and we are going to the moon bois.
Kevin needs to read about monetary history...
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:32:02
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:29:02
The worlds goods will be paid for in BTC and not fiat. Always HODL on.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:44:28
Good kit
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:57:19
Sell 7.6k
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:43:38
They deserve it.
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:01:32
Doesn't matter in 5 years Bitcoin will be worth over $200k. Short term movements do not matter.
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:01:01
On yeah UK won't count anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:38:17

Good luck I think the lowest BTC will go is to 6k so don't worry and HODL. Lets revolutionise this world!

@_date: 2019-05-27 14:14:20
Thats the people who know nothing trying not to sound dumb. But they are dumb if they don't understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:02:31
V nice
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:45:59
Sell at 500k
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:07:45
Wont go below $6.8k now. :(
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:37:39
Sorry to hear that. Use revolut?
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:29:21
Lol didn't trade it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:38:31
Agreed with this.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:47:07
Shorts still need to be squeezed expect higher highs
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:10:50
Celsius network is ok but buy cold storage hardware
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:19:59
Until 500k btc
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:12:35

DCA over the next 3 months every week. So 12ish smaller purchases every week.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:53:26
Probably hit $9k BTC/USD
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:45:38
Hold on for dear life . But just hold

So true i wished this accumulation phase lasted longer but everyone went and fomoed in....
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:11:53
You can deposit with celsius.network and get around 6%-10% interest on your bitcoin which is paid weekly to you in bitcoins! Other crypto options available too.
They work for the people and are against the traditional banks!
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:14:43
I don't understand, please explain what you are trying to convey. Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:15:43
Deposit some to celsius.network and get like 6%-10% interest on your bitcoins that you are hodling. Maybe deposit only 20% and keep the rest with you on cold storage. All the best!
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:07:45
Moby flipped!
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:14:11
I missed 3000 tho.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:00:58
Who wants Bitcoin, I heard it is rat poison.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:41:18
I would watch this in cinemas
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:35:17
It wont. Wont even see 5k again
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:15:45
I have not watched a single video of his. Don't want to catch stupid. Be careful!
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:31:36
I recommend using the ignite ratings platform and read the comments on Bitcoin. That should be helpful rather than me repeating myself to everyone.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:12:34
7.4k USD
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:28:50
Dammit you need to put up a chart at the end where bitcoin goes parabolic to 8k!
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:46:55
Oh i get it
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:07:41
Technical, Fundamental and Sentiment analysis should all be used in conjunction with each other. All point towards +$200k Bitcoin within the next 4 years.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:08:30
Get the popcorn ready, what a show 2020 will be!
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:39:36
People are hoping it crashes back down to 6k so they can fill their bags. IMO it wont happen. The ship has sailed. :(
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:51:44
I think one final dip to 7.7k then BTC will be ready to rally up to 9k in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2019-05-31 09:19:53
Oh fuck this is good.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:07:57
Plant away brother, let's hope it doesn't grow any shitcoins.

@_date: 2019-05-11 11:26:53
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:52:21
I cannot say whether to buy or sell but try to be informed about what bitcoin is. Understand how banks and the economy works and also how the money system has evolved over the years (e.g. gold standard).
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:07:37
So Happy I am :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 12:48:24
If 70% then HODL
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:56:29
It was supposed to be the creaky sound of the hinges that have been worn out from the crypto volatility. But i'll take your compliment anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:45:34
Neeenawwww neeeenawww
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:29:05
Decentralised ledger which is pretty much immune to 51% attacks to reverse transactions.
10 years of track record.
Appreciates in value.
Store of value and a payment rail (this has never been done before) that is global.
Governments can't take it away from you.
Scarcity only 21m BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:37:02

@_date: 2019-05-21 20:16:34
Economic teachers just know about books from tbe pre 2000 era and just spew it out. I wrote about BTC in of of my economic exams about the money systems (e.g. gold standard etc) and practically failed even though my points were valid and answered the questions. These old rats have no foresight.
