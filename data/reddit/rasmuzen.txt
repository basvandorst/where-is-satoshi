All the generation is done client side -- private keys never touch my servers. I'm gonna build a downloadable offline version shortly!

Sorry about that, I'm on vacation. Just replied!

Just ran "python heartbleed.py cia.gov" and then realized what I did and waited nervously for ten seconds in case the S.W.A.T. team was going to show up...

Private keys are generated on client side and never touch my server. I'm working on a downloadable package that works without internet next for those extra paranoid about security.

What a fucking joke.

I was looking for a service just like this the other day and couldn't find it. I was gonna end up using bitstamps API but that's way too much overhead to easily accept USD and turn them into BTC.

Technically you can put something on a USB without it ever seeing the internet if you generate the key locally on your computer and then save it in a file on the USB (while the computer is unplugged from the internet the entire time).

Not all of it. For example, I believe their giant database containing balances and transactions for addresses (and the code used to create it) is not open source. I think there's a bunch of good stuff they keep to themselves.

The only thing more credible than Yahoo! News is Yahoo! Answers.

This is really cool! How did you make this?

As a friend with a lot of Canadians, I like the message. But after reading this I'm a little confused why Canadians specifically should invest in Bitcoin. Can you explain it to me like I'm an eighth grader? I think you'd reach a wider audience.

How exactly does delivery work? Can't the police just order something and arrest the deliverer? I don't understand how they get away with this.

Your server is vulnerable to the heartbleed attack.

I wonder how all of those startup guys are doing now.
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:40:01
This same thing happened to me today. This is unacceptable and goxy and the reason I will no longer use Bitstamp. They should at least give people a grace period of a few days to withdraw funds before bitcoins are literally stuck for a week or possibly longer.

They asked for the same documents: valid government ID and proof of residence. It seems they think the documents I submitted previously are were somehow found out to be no longer valid. They didn't include any information on what was wrong with the previous documents.
Here's the full message:

I day traded on Bitstamp for about 4 months and then recently permanently withdrew my entire balance because I had a big issue with their customer service.
They re-reviewed my proof of residency document 4 months after it was originally accepted and deemed it was invalid. They sent me a support message basically saying "your account has been unverified" with little explanation as to why. This locked down my entire balance from trading or withdrawal which is unacceptable. When I demanded they undo this action or give me a day to at least get my money off their platform while I reverify my documents, they had no response except to clarify that the invalid document was my proof of residence document.
This is completely unacceptable and I will not be using Bitstamp anymore. You can read my blog post about it here: 
Edit: also worth noting that it took me a week to get ahold of a paper bank statement to re-verify my account, this week was during the recent crash which would have been a great week to day trade (sell high, buy low) and probably cost me a lot of money...

Yeah I understand. But that doesn't help me turn around and explain to all my Canadian friends why they should invest in Bitcoin :P
I'd still appreciate an eighth grader explanation.

I hate it when I post my private keys online accidentally online.

Doesn't have the same ring

Hopefully I'll be reading this post again next year :D

It is open source in that all of the generation code runs in the browser (JavaScript) you can simply download the entire page, unplug your computer's internet, and run it locally and it should still work. Gonna make a package that makes it easier to do this soon!

Are you sober?

Bitstamp is originally based out of Slovenia and is now somehow headquartered in the UK. 


Why? I am a US customer so unfortunately those are the only companies I'm able to deal with. I don't see what's wrong with US BTC companies.
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:38:18
Did you happen to use a paystamp for your proof of residency document? Perhaps they decided or found out that that wasn't actually a valid document? Still very goxy of them to do this.
