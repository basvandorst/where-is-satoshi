Who the fuck is promoting circle this hard? I have an account, I get it. But I'm tired of seeing this shit. I'll stick to coinbase just because of all this circle-jerking.

Yeah, fuck off. I spent btc at Dell, over stock, and new egg today.  You know why? 
Because I (fucking) wanted to!

Writing your own would be fairly counter-intuitive.
I think writing the client to be pub/priv key based might be significantly better, as it will work across TOR or any other "darknet", but will need to comb through a bit more of this to see what exactly his happening.

I've not been selling, but using.  Not so much since this dip, but i've been buying up, too.
Edit: And for those asking why I sold .8 then re-bought 1.0 -- I cut my budget pretty tight, and rather than transfer from savings, I liquidated what I had on hand.

For the record, that post was from 2013 and not mine -- I found it while checking to see if I could pay the bill with BitCoin.

It can not.
It also looks like multiple sellers sharing the same IP address can not work effectively due to how accounts are tied together.
I just started digging through the code today, but it looks like your IP *is* your identity.  Hopefully, we can figure out a way to change that.

People wanted a way to donate to Mozilla with bit coin, and now you have it. If you quit trying to ram it up everybody's ass then it might be better received by people. But instead you want to use donations as a cover for free advertising. And that, my friend, is bullshit.

The reason i'd like them to switch over to BitCoin is because of my work.  I travel, a lot, internationally.  As a result, my credit card gets put on hold quite a bit, accounts get locked for secondary verification, etc.  
With BTC, I can tap my screen a couple of times and the bill is paid.  It's great.
Edit: Looks like it's time to switch hosts... Response from hostgator:
Thank you for contacting HostGator. We appreciate you taking the time to contact us and share your feedback.
We recognize the growing popularity of BitCoin and that more businesses are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as a valid payment option. We certainly wish to provide a number of convenient options for payment to our customers, but even some of the more established methods, such as Western Union payments, have come with difficulties in implementation and practice. We are not considering implementing BitCoin as a payment method at this time..
Thank you again for your feedback. Please let us know if we can assist with any other issues or concerns.
Best Regards,
