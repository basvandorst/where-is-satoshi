So when you have a decentralised, not premined, base layer that has no use for a centralised second layer, that's not a good thing? When the whole point of this post is that bitcoin is NOT centralised? 
Your argument makes no sense. Since we already know DGB is LESS centralised and LESS premined.
This post is saying bitcoin matters because it's not centralised, so you can't say 'oh but it's OK if it is though'.
You can't just say 'it's a shit coin', without addressing the ways it is actually better.
Calling something a shit coin, doesn't mean it has no value of its own.
Its what iOS fans did when Android came along with its bigger feature set and better scalability.
And which one became more dominant once smartphones became mainstream?
It doesn't matter if you've copied something, if you've sufficiently improved upon it.
Pride and Prejudice is boring, so someone copied it, made it less boring by adding zombies. Then Pride and Prejudice with Zombies, became a NY Times best seller.

The best part about it is you don't even need to know its there or do anything differently, you just enter the sort code, account number and amount then hit send as you always did. Nothing new to learn.
Technology that just works without you needing to do anything differently always has the upper hand.
Which is why nobody uses the services they brought out a few years back where you send it to their phone number instead for privacy.

That's the thing, I am a firm believer of BTC.
But... I'm open to the fact that some Alts just have better tech.
Its not to say I want DGB or any other alt to take over BTC.
I just want BTC to do something, and soon. Because the way things are more and more people will start to look at alts. And the more they do, the less these alts are going to go away.
When we see companies making their own technology, instead of using existing ones. That means there is a problem.
And making something more complicated to use, isn't the way to get more people to use it.
Too many of us on here just listen to what we're told in one or two subreddits, and never actually look at what the alts are doing, (and doing with less fighting).
Ideas aren't automatically bad because someone else had it.

But if there's no benefit to BCH, what is the benefit to BTC over alt coins which are more secure, faster and cheaper than both?
Surely it puts BTC &amp; BCH in the same boat. At least for the moment until they adapt more.
I wouldn't diss anyone for using either over the other at this point in time.
Investment wise, I'm split between the 3 big ones for the bulk of it. But I really like the technology behind DGB so have some in there too.
For spending and sharing I currently only use DGB, as both BTC and BCH are far too expensive and slow. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:02:40
Digibyte is actually more secure, and has just past its 6millionth block today. It is less open to system breakdown than bitcoin due to its 5 algorithms and instantaneous difficulty adjustment, making attacks much harder.
If you have a fire/earthquake in a major Chinese  bitcoin mining farm when you're 2 weeks away from a difficulty adjustment, the whole thing would stall and it could be months before transactions are back to working properly. But Digibyte wouldn't even feel it if the same happened.
Not all alt coins are shit coins, but many of them are.

If you say LN transactions are the type that don't currently happen but will once it comes, and that opening and closing will increase the on chain traffic without LN reducing it. 
You are saying that - LN won't solve the scaling problem, won't lower costs for the things people are currently using it for, and will actually slow things down and make it more expensive. 
You could be right. Though if you are, the cost for loading LN will increase, the time needed to load it will make it cumbersome, and then people have less incentive to use it.
So it would be hoisted by its own petard.
In order for it to work, people have to use it, for the transactions they currently do on chain.

If it's a service that's free, and just sits there forever just in case one day your phone or heating bill goes out £5 more than you were expecting that month. Instead of being charged £10 you get charged nothing. 
Then why not.
And over draft isn't for emergency spending, it's for larger than expected direct debits.
Its a free insurance, that stops you being charged fees.
If you don't have it, and your car insurance tries to go out without enough funds, you'll be charged £10 by the insurer instead. Either way you're getting charged if you don't have an overdraft.

In order to compete with banks, the fee needs to be £0.00 GBP, with a very negligible number a few 0s away. Or people stick to the banks. 
Something clearly needs to be done. I don't move my BTC anymore. I've become a hodler because it's not worth moving any. For any real world sharing with foreign friends (which is the only reason not to just use free bank transfers), it has to be alt coins for now.

Well, the price of a single coin is so low, because as you pointed out there are 21b instead of 21m. So there's less issue with people wanting to buy a whole one. 
But that aside there's no PR, they just haven't done any, other than at bitcoin conferences.
That said, the community (who are all very friendly), have been asking for PR and promotions, and so a few days ago the dev team announced they had sourced a suitable PR firm and started a community wallet to pay for it, which was 100% funded within a few hours, so PR will now be starting soon.
Its an old coin, its the longest Blockchain out of them all, its very secure, and has lots of real world possibilities. But it's only ever gone by word of mouth, hopefully thatll be changing and it'll have some more public awareness soon.
When I say it's practically unbeatable for small transactions, I mean it confirms within seconds and costs a microscopic fraction of a penny. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:08:58
Well, DGB which I mentioned, happens to be more secure than bitcoin.
To do a 51% attack on bitcoin, you need only have 51% of one algorithm.
DGB has 5 algorithms, split between CPU, GPU &amp; ASIC mining. In order to do a 51% attack you need to have 51% of 4 algorithms and 92% of the 5th.
This make it more secure.
Its also less centralised with 10x more nodes.
There are lots of cryptos out there, I don't know much about most of them, but I'm sure there must be others which are more secure also. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:00:06


True they do.
But DGB has been around 5 years, and has become the longest Blockchain, with 10x more nodes than bitcoin and manages to be both less centralised and vastly more scalable. So I don't expect it to go anywhere anytime soon.


Again they do. But we haven't been seeing that with this one. This one seems to be resilient.
We can't go by what has happened in the past and assume the same will happen again, and certainly not this time.
I don't think lightning is the answer, but it may be a suitable stop gap to finding the answer.

Its not the first time that US banks are over a decade behind other western countries, but you can bet if there was a legitimate risk of people moving to crypto for speed or cost, then they will introduce it.
The onlt reason I expect they haven't yet, is because people are still willing to pay the fees.
Any European country to any other European country typically arrives the next morning and does have a small fee for the exchange (much lower than bitcoin currently). 
Within country, it's instant and free.
I can sit here with my baking apps on my phone and shift money around without a second thought and know it's there before I've put my phone down.
Bitcoin needs to adapt, because there is older technology that is already faster, which countries like the US could decide to implement if they thought bitcoin was a risk to them.
Theres no doubt in my mind that if Digibyte and Bitcoin changed places in terms of mainstream recognition, they would be implementing their own services already.
So any change that bitcoin makes needs to come FAST, as they need to outpace the banks to getting mainstream acceptance. They have a lot of money to throw at a problem if they think there's going to be any legitimate risk. 
Because let's face it, we do and Venezuelans might, but most people out there don't care about decentralisation.

In GBP, BCH is still £0.01 typically, and takes a fair while, sure it's not as much or as long as BTC, but DGB is £0.0000004 and takes a few seconds.
Sure sending money to friends doesn't need to be super super speedy and BCH would be fine, but the cost and speed of DGB is worth supporting in my opinion, especially since it's more scalable.

Comparing bitcoin to an Alt:
Bitcoin only has 1 mining algorithm compared to DGBs 5, which makes DGB much more secure. 
DGB has 6x more full nodes currently which makes it more decentralised and is by design harder to centralise. 
Its faster with 400x more transactions per second than BTC.
It has 15 second block times compared to 10 minutes.
It has built in scalability which allows it to overtake Visa by 2020 and eventually be 140,000x more transactions per second than Visa. All on chain without a clunky second layer needed. 
Real time difficulty adjustment compared with fortnightly.
And the cost per transaction is only $0.00000035.
So what plans does bitcoin have to address the lower security and centralisation if these are the only things that make it matter?
Clearly these aren't the only things that make it matter, what makes it matter is market presence. So something needs to be done because as more people come in to crypto we all know they come in to bitcoin first, as it has all the free attention in the papers.
But as they start to research they start moving into alts.
Alts go up as bitcoin goes up, because alts are bought with bitcoin as well as those buying bitcoin for bitcoin. Eventually more USD/Alt trading pairs will open and that will start to not be the case.

Perhaps in your country. But in the UK any UK bank will transfer to any UK bank without a fee, and instantaneously, using the'Faster Payments Service'.
Its been around since 2008, typically the limit is £250,000 in any one transaction, but nothing stopping you doing multiple ones straight away.
It is free, it is typically instantaneous, (I bank with most of the major banks and building societies, the longest I know of is the Co-op &amp; Santander who take around 5-10 mins, the fastest are HSBC, First Direct, RBS &amp; Halifax, where it is always in there within seconds.)
They do say it could take up to 2 hours, but I've never known that to be the case.
I transfer FIAT around my accounts a lot, the typical scenario, one bank for bills, one for savings, 3 for trading, one for household spending, one for personal spending etc, one I use just for holiday money in case a card is stolen abroad, (though now I use the CURVE card which links to any of my debit cards) and one for my salary to pay into before being sent around the others. It is by far and a way the fastest, safest and cheapest way to move money around. Also bank accounts themselves are free to open and use, so there's no sense in staying loyal to one bank. 
But I do send Digibyte to certain friends abroad I holiday with, because international transfers between currencies isn't good value (and takes next day which is too slow). That's where crypto currencies come into play.
My point is though, if the UK banks can all have free and instant transfers between them for 10 years, if crypto starts to take off significantly in the general public, it won't be long before banks on other countries like the US and elsewhere adopt the same tried and tested transfer systems, as a way to make bitcoin transactions seem needlessly expensive and retain their customer bases.
If your banks aren't free now, they will be! 
Mainstream adoption demands low fees. Seriously low fees.
And in that respect, I think we're all too quick to dismiss some of the alt coins out there, some of them have some really good technology behind them, have no issues with scalability, are more decentralised, have more real world usage, and just might take a big chunk of the bitcoin space when it comes to mainstream adoption later down the road.
We should be looking at alt coins for ideas instead of being so quick to dismiss them all, just because they have a different name and came later to the game.

1 address HAD 20%, back in 2014 when it first launched. 19% was given away in drops and 1% to developers. That is not uncommon, and no cause for concern. Ethereum was 20% premined and also 60% pre-sale, and that doesn't make it a  shit coin. Bitcoin also had its genesis block, which was only later (likely accidentally) made unspendable. 
It is capped at 21b supply just as bitcoin is capped at a limited 21m supply. These are arbitrary numbers, the point is it has a limited cap.
Ethereum has no limit. So what is your point?
It also has 15 second block times, and a USD fee of $0.00000044.
Its also working at 1000tx, but scalable by design to multiple times visa. 
Its practically unbeatable for sending small amounts, which is what most use it for, but there's no reason you can use it for large amounts also.
Its more decentralised, more secure, faster and cheaper. But otherwise very close to bitcoin, and based on bitcoin. However, it has no problems with scaling on chain.

As of today Bitcoin has 11,657 nodes.
As of a few months ago DGB had 100,000 nodes (I don't know today's figure, but it wont be lower).
It also has a longer chain, (I believe its actually the longest, but not sure on that, there could be longer ones). Since its been around for 5 years, compared to 9, but has a 15 second block timing, not 10 minutes, so would naturally be a longer.
There are others with 15 second blocks too (ETH), but not ones that have been around as long I believe, could be wrong.
It also runs 5 algorithms, which are split between CPU, GPU &amp; ASIC mining, to prevent ASIC dominance/centralisation. And real-time difficulty adjustment to prevent any outages by a major hash drop as is possible with others if a larger miner goes offline. 
It was also the first to adopt Segwit if you're a fan of that.

Yes never invest what you can't afford to lose... But we all know for some people they're coming into crypto not to make money, but to try and protect their money from their governments. (Venezuela).
Which is afterall, it's purpose for existing.
If you live in a volatile country, and you're putting your whole wage packet into a crypto, because it's the only way to protect it from the government, then a 50% dip will very much affect if you can eat past the 15th of the month or not.

DGB is based on bitcoin.
It is an improved bitcoin.
But that's the point, it has improved upon the parts this thread is saying are the important parts about bitcoin. Which it says alts have failed to do, but clearly they haven't, theyve done it, and theyve done it better.
So what does bitcoin plan to make it's technology back to being the fast, secure, decentralised one it claims to hold the crown for?
Because currently it feels like it is fiddling while Rome is burning.
(we'll ignore the fact that the guy tweeting is clearly a moron, and bangs on about how important decrealisation is, then starts promoting having a reserve holding your coins for second layer usage.

I think this is one of those things which is worse in the US banks than UK ones from what you've said. But not sure...
If you have an account with no overdraft. If a payment goes out which takes your balance below £0, you get charged £10.
If you have an account with an overdraft facility of £100, if your balance goes below £0 you don't get charged anything _(most banks, some charge interest or a daily £1 fee)_
If it goes below £100 you get charged £10 plus interest. 
If you have an arranged overdraft of £2000, you won't be charged on the first £100 if it's less than a month, and interest on anything over £100.
You can disable unarranged overdrafts, but that then means you can't you pay at pump petrol stations, contactless payments, etc. Debit cards guarantee to pay the vendor up to £99 so long as there is at least £1 on the account when the card is inserted.
Long story short. Always have an overdraft set up, and never use it. Never try and go without one, because there's absolutely no reason not to.

2.5c per transaction assuming you want to make 100 that week, and your coins are tied up and unusable for non-lightning payments unless you close it out again. 
When you could be paying $0.00000022 for on chain transactions which are faster than lightning and more scalable and more decentralised than bitcoin let alone lightning which isn't? 
We need more work for bitcoin to be competitive, and it can be done. But doesn't look like anyone wants to.
Not any time soon anyway.
Lightning is a bit of duct tap on a crack in the dam and I just can't get excited about it, or have any plans to use it.

There was 50BTC premined and held. It wasn't until quite some time later that they were made unspendable.
I have no issue with a coin premining a tiny percentage and handing those coins out for free to random people to start a bit of interest in it. Most of which, 4 years later, like the genesis are probably now lost forever anyway.
Premining is only really an issue when the developer is keeping something like 20-80% of them. If the developers hold less than 0.2%, I'm not bothered, if it helps them with their time and expense of setting it up.
It doesn't affect me and doesn't affect the technology behind the coin.
But in any case, as I said before, I'm not promoting DGB, what I'm saying is bitcoin should change in meaningful ways to address how they've managed to overcome bitcoins issues, without second layer solutions, which as we know, whether you like it or not, are contentious.
We also need to address why it's so hard for the community to get behind each initiative, take Segwit for example, DGB implemented that back in April, no fuss, no hassle, no complaints. Bit bitcoin it was such a struggle and most still aren't using it. Lightning is going to be worse.

Faster Payments Service.
In use by all UK banks to any other UK bank, and is the default way of transferring funds. 
Typically it is capped to £250,000, but there's nothing to stop you doing 4 of them at the same time. Minimum transaction £0.01. 
Max it can take 2hours, but usually closer to 1s.

@_date: 2018-01-21 14:10:07
No emotion in that response at all.
Lightning is centralised for one. MAST goes against the full blocker ethos which was the reason they gave us that bitcoin wasn't going to change the block size.
And none of these would bring bitcoin into the levels of scalability that other alts already have just by 'tweaking'.
DGB was much less premined than bitcoin was, and the vast majority of them were given out to introduce people to it.
I'm also not pumping a shit coin, since as you know I originally didn't say which coin it was. But would rather have a logical discussion about the benefits of the other, and how bitcoin could have better implemented similar options.

Chocolate chip cookies are tax free, but a cookie covered in chocolate is taxed.
It just makes a lot more sense to show the amount you actually have to pay. 
Only around 10% of the population need to do a tax return. Those are business owners, or retired people who still earn over £100,000 annually. 
For everyone else, income tax is just a line item on your payslip and sales tax is on your receipt. But it means nothing to you, as you have no choice. It just makes it a lot easier for everyone. 
So reciept go straight in the bin.

Bitcoin is also evolving slower than many other coins. Ethereum could easily surpass it. And other lesser known coins are already far ahead.
The coin with the longest Blockchain out there is scalable beyond visa, on chain, and confirms in seconds with a 	$0.00000044 fee. It's also more secure and decentralised with 5 mining algorithms. 
If the tech was what's important bitcoin would have gone a long time ago, but we all know its not the tech that's important, it's the name and the marketing. 
For now anyway.
But that wasn't my point. The whole crypto market could keep falling forever and never recover, there's nothing to say it has to ever recover. If it was over today, but people still held on, you couldn't say that you've not lost anything because you haven't sold yet.
You have lost when the value goes below where you bought in. It doesn't matter when you sell, it just means you don't gain if it goes back up again.

The EU does not hide taxes.
The price on the sticker is the price you need to pay at the till. Which makes shopping far easier, since items in a supermarket are taxed differently, but at the end of the day the amount of tax means nothing to you, you just have to pay the sticker price.
Then at the bottom of your reciept it breaks down the tax for you, in case you're self employed and need to do a tax return.
(Most people don't do tax returns unless they're self employed, it's all automatic if you're an employee)

But shorter times with real time difficulty adjustment, can protect against issues longer blocks with 2 weekly difficulty adjustment has when a large chunk of hash power goes offline.

Digibyte scales on chain perfectly.

Digibyte is resistant to this.

Thats your tissue box with you name on it.
There are many other tissue boxes out there which will do the same thing.
What makes it unique and therefore valuable?
If your tissue box can be filled with cash and taken abroad then emptied. Why does that have more value than box which is also locked with a padlock, and when you take the cash out less gets stuck in the box forever?
Adoption as a currency is the only way to maintain the value of bitcoin.
Holding it as gold will not. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:54:19
Except that like a tissue box, there are many many other p2p networks that do the same things as bitcoin, and many, arguably do it better. With the same scarcity.
So bitcoin only has value, for as long as someone is willing to exchange it for goods.
Just as dollars only have value if people are willing to exchange it for goods. You could have 1m USD in cash, but if you're in Greece and the foreign exchanges are closed. Then it has no value.

We are talking once they have all been released. Like we know they are limited.
Now yes, you've said there a real world use case for it. Sending money around the world.
Now that means bitcoin is not digital gold, it must be treated as a digital currency, or it has no value.
So in order to have that real world case you've given it. It must therefore compete with the other currencies who can serve the same purpose, but more securely, faster and cheaper.
Otherwise you're back to Disney Euros having value and not Disney Dollars.

@_date: 2018-07-17 16:08:26
Yes. Trading. So buying and selling.
I never once mentioned selling at the current price did I?
Now if people only ever buy, and save. Once all bitcoins are released, and all have been bought, the traders have sold all they have, and the value was last somewhere in the stratosphere.
Now what value does it have?
If they have all been bought, and kept as gold. Why would someone else want to buy one?
What purpose does it serve to them to own it? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:59:23
Wow, you REAALLLYYYYY missed the point.
I mean the point is somewhere in London and you're looking for it somewhere in Sydney.
A ferrari is just an example. I could have used grass or a shoe. It doesn't matter. Ferarri = X in that very simplified example. 
The box is worthless, unless someone other than the holder gives it a value. 
The box = A
What you want for it = B
What someone else is willing to pay in cash = C
Cash value of what someone else is willing to trade =D
A /= B
B /= C
A = C
A = D 
C /= D
C &lt; D
It could not be more simple. 
You holding the box does not give the box value. 
Someone else wanting the box gives it value. 
Its value is no higher than the goods that can be exchanged for the box, unless you expect the box to be worth more goods than it can currently be traded for in future. If you believe that then C &gt; D. But only if you believe that. 
If D = 0. C = 0. Unless speculation. 
Therefore if bitcoin is treated as a store of value, and isn't used as a currency, then it becomes valueless. 
Unless... There is a group consensus that it holds a particular value. But, since it has no USP, it has no value other than what it can be traded for. 
Its only hope is adoption (mass consensus). Currently it's only value is through consensus and speculation in a minuscule population. If any other coin gets better adoption of the greater market the value disappears. That value can be held through adoption, but adoption doesn't come by treating it as gold, adoption comes by using it as a currency. 
If it is not a currency, it is nothing. 
So spend it. Replenish it, spend it again. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:52:34
Nobody said it was going to be easy.
But step 1, is to stop calling it gold and encouraging people to hold it.
It needs to be spent, and replenished.
Spend it, get some more, spend that. Keep spending it.
Spend it anywhere you can spend it.
Thats what stops the places who accept it now from stopping, and that's what encourages others to accept it.
And that's what gives it some value.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:01:35
I believe you have mis read my comment.


EXACTLY! That is what I said. Thanks.
So if ferrari are willing to exchange a £1m car for either my box or £1m. People will bid for my box until £999,999.
The maximum the box is worth to them is £1 less than the ferrari, or else they would buy it with cash.
NOBODY would buy the box for £1.5m, if it can only be exchanged for goods worth £1m.


No, no it isn't.
I hold this box, do you want it?
Unless you can get something for this box, why would you want it?
IF bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency, then it would have a value, as it would be the only one you could use to move money without banks etc.
But it isn't.
So the only way for it to have value, is if people are willing to exchange it for goods.
FYI, I did stay in school, and got a degree in economics and mathematical sciences. :) 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:49:01
What utility?
My box can be used to store all sorts of things.
Gold is valuable because it can do something no other element can. What does bitcoin do that no other cryptocurrency can?
There is nothing.. Which is why adoption as a real world currency is the only way for it to maintain value, as that would be something it can do that no other can. (if achieved first) 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:02:56
Gold is valuable because it is scarce, but not too scarce, and also because its properties mean it can do things that no other metal/element can do. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:00:13
Of course it does.
The value of bitcoin is based on what people agree to buy and sell it for. Or the amount of goods people agree can be exchanged for it. 
If nobody sells, then it has no value.
Imagine all BTC have been bought. But there's no real life use for it. Why then does it have any value at all?
In you buy Disney Dollars, when you leave Disney Land, they have a value of £0.
So the only way for Bitcoin to have value is to create a Disney Land where you can spend them.
Once the whole world is Disney Land, then Disney dollars become more valuable, once the world only accepts Disney Dollars, then they become vastly more valuable. 
If everyone holds and never sells, this is the same as Disney Land going out of business or switching to Disney Euros, where the Disney Dollar loses all value entirely. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:12:09
Right now.
But right now won't last forever.
The reason it's gold right now, is because its the entry coin to the market.
But when more markets open to USD/Alt trading pairs, bitcoin loses its USP.
Its USP is adoption. But now with decentralised exchanges and new trading pairs etc. The adoption has to come in the form of use as a currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:52:10
It is the same in most respects. But block size is vastly easier to change and it changes automatically every block. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:21:14
What are you talking about.
We are not talking trading here. We're talking value.
If you own 1 btc, you bought for 10k, but now all the BTC have been bought but it has no real life use, then why would anyone buy your BTC from you?
Why would it be worth 10k or more to them?
It has no intrinsic value, unless it's adopted as a real world currency.
So it doesn't work as gold. It only has value if it is used. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:02:37
That is not true.
A scarce item is only valuable, if it has a real world case and fits a purpose that can't be achieved by something else.
I have a tissue box here, I have signed my name on it. It is the only tissue box in the world with my name on it. - it is not valuable. There are many other boxes without my name which serve the same purpose.
Gold is scarce, but has real world properties which cant be replicated by another metal. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:38:39


YES! That is its USP, - Adoption.
But that USP disappears as soon as decentralised exchanges open and new trading blocks open.
So real world adoption is the only way to keep that USP.


Yes, a 51% attack on bitcoin requires 51%. A 51% attack on DGB requires 51% of 4 algorithms, and 92% of the 5th. Which requires 5 different types of hardware running different algorithms.


Quick changes? DGB has real time difficulty adjustment instead of 2weeks, which means it adjusts every block, with blocks every 15seconds. So it could not ever be brought down by an earthquake and powerfailure in China for instance, which would bring BTC to a standstill for many many weeks. Other changes in the protocol etc are as bitcoin, they are both based on the same technology.
It does everything BTC does. And more. Its also old and established.
But... It doesnt have the adoption.. Adoption is BTCs USP. Which is why adoption should be pushed and not treating it as gold. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:45:05
Bitcoin 8,000 full nodes.
Digibyte 200,000 full nodes.
Not necessarily totally comparable. But you get the idea.
I didn't realise before theyve alresdy hit the 520tps. I've not been following coins much this year. The next stop is 2000tps by the end of next year.
Its also the longest Blockchain out there, not that that is important but it shows that its successfully stable and most importantly scalable on chain.
But that was just one coin I picked out that does things bitcoin does and better. Its for that reason that bitcoin needs to work on keeping its lead in adoption and not try to reinvent itself into some kind of digital gold.
We don't need a digital gold, in order for it to keep value it needs to be a viable currency and get adopted and used.
Otherwise there is nothing at all except the name keeping it's value. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:49:17


But it has other uses which are not unique by any stretch of the imagination.


The person with the goods, not the person with the currency.


Hense why I said the 70s. And that's why the value of gold dropped at that point. But it is internationally regarded as holding value, because it has MASS adoption as such.
Bitcoin does not have mass adoption. It has adoption amongst crypto enthusiasts, the only way to keep its value is to push adoption further into real world use. Before another one does it. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:30:42
So if it doesn't work as a currency, what is its value?
How do you determine its value if you can't place it against the number of goods you can buy with it?


Except that they did accept gold, and until very recently. The value on those credit cards is still basically based on how much gold it could buy in the 70s. So gold still holds a value.
But arguably, it probably won't forever. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:13:42
Yes there are metals with more uses.

But that's simply not true.
Digibyte for example is faster, cheaper and safer than bitcoin or Litecoin which are based on the same technology.
So where is bitcoins USP?
Why does anyone use bitcoin over DGB, other than because it has more adoption?
Adoption is why bitcoin has value, and adoption is not increased by being treated as gold. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:40:54
But it only has use cases which can be done with any other crypto.
Adoption is its only USP. Which is why adoption needs to be pushed and not treating it as gold.
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:22:38
If nobody pushes BTC adoption in real world uses, because its treated as 'gold', then how is it staying ahead of the crowd?
Remember when AOL was a monopoly?
All it would take is Starbucks and Target to accept DGB, and coinbase to add USD/DGB trading pair and boom. BTC is dead.
Now that's unlikely to say the least, but things change quickly.
The only way bitcoin keeps its value in the future is if it gets accepted in target, Starbucks, tesco and everywhere else.
Then even if others come along, so long as its accepted it has value.
If it stayed as the entry currency it would also keep value. But it won't because of decentralised exchanges and new trading pairs.

But that's the point. dgb is less susceptible to a 51% attack than bitcoin.
And lightning isnt faster than onchain with DGB, not once you take into account opening channels etc.
So where is its USP?

And which of those two came first and paved the way?
And which came later, did it better, started smaller and then easily overtook when the other stopped being adopted?

But... If all the BTC get bought.
And nobody sells.
Then its value becomes £0.
Until it starts to be used as a currency, then its value as an asset drops.
Gold retains its value as an asset, because it has real world uses and is a valuable item to start with.
The most important priority is creating real world uses, since the value is only speculation of potential future use cases.

Because it does a job that no other metal/element can do, thanks to being both rare (but not too rare) and non-reactive. It's also pretty. 
No other element fits the bill, which makes it valuable.
Bitcoin on the other hand has rarity. But it does not have the benefit gold in that any other crypto Currency can do what it does, and many do it better.
An item doesn't necessarily need to have an intrinsic value if people collectively decide it has value. If people collectively decide bitcoin has value by agreeing to exchange it for goods and services, then it has value.
IF however it gets to a point where people only hold and it isn't used as a form of currency. Then it has no value, because although 1 bitcoin is rare, 1 (crypto Currency) is not.

I have a tissue box with my name signed on it.
There is only one in the world.
I don't want to sell it to you.
What is its value?
If however, Ferarri really wants my box, and agrees to give whoever hands them the box a new car.
Now the box has value.
I still don't want to sell.
Now the box has more value.
Unless there is the ability to trade an item for goods &amp; services, it has no value.
If nobody wants my box, it is worthless, as soon as someone wants it, it has value. 
Imagine bitcoin is boxes, every time I sign a box they become less valuable. But as soon as I stop signing them they stop losing value. But only if people still want to trade them for cars. 
If Ferarri decides it no longer wants boxes. The boxes value drops to £0.
People will continue to bid for boxes/bitcoins as long as they think the item they can buy with it in the future will be worth more than the price they are buying the box for. 
If ferrari doesn't want boxes, then you're buying a box that is worth less than the price you're paying for it. So why would you buy boxes? 
Thats why bitcoin cannot be used as gold, it only has value if its adopted as a real world currency.

DGB?

But what from your list can't be done by any other cryptocurrency?
Gold had a USP, in that no other element could do what it does.
What is bitcoins USP?
If it doesn't have one for treating it as gold, it's only USP is adoption. Which means adoption is the way to keep its value, not treating it as gold.

No they won't.
Its only the online banking platform, the regular banking services aren't affected, just the way the online platform pulls the data.
Customers can still go into a branch or cash point and transact the old fashioned way. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:02:07
It's close, you should keep no more than the guaranteed insured amount in any one place.
That would be £0 on exchanges and £1m in a checking account. :) 
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:45:12
Not quite, there would have to be multiple levels of failure for you to fully lose access to your money. You can still walk into Barclays and transfer into your Barclays account if the app goes down, so long as the debit card processing system is up. If both went down at the same time you'd be in a bit of trouble until it was repaired.
But that said. If any one of those banks, even the digital only ones was to go bust, your money is still fully protected. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:24:47
That's incorrect. Other holders don't give it value when the hodl.
Other holders only give it value when they buy more.
Imagine you live on a street, 
Everyone who owns a house on the street collectively decide their houses are worth £1m. 
But there is an identical street next to it, the houses on that street are selling for £500k. 
The people in street A can decide that their houses are worth £1m to them, but they aren't worth that unless someone is willing to buy one at that price. If no houses on that street sell, then they don't have that value. 
The only way the first street will ever be valued above the second is if it has a unique feature over the other. 
Let's say Street A is in a better school district, perhaps to buyers that now makes it worth more than street B, even though they are otherwise identical. 
Bitcoin is not a unique technology. As far as crypto technologies go, it's pretty basic. 
Its USP, the thing that makes it more valuable than the identical roads next door, even more so than the roads next door with bigger flashier houses - is Adoption. 
It is the most widely known currency, it is the entry currency for most exchanges. 
This is its USP. 
But it is also losing that. 
Decentralised exchanges and new trading pairs that open every day chip away at that USP every day. 
The moment more people buy Ethereum first instead of Bitcoin, bitcoin is finished. 
Thats why pushing adoption is important, if bitcoin gets mass adoption outside of exchanges, that is, in the wallets people use to spend, that is how it keeps value.
It will NEVER retain its value if everybody HODLs forever.
Imagine the town those streets are in, nobody wants to sell their houses, because they believe new buyers are coming to the town, and their houses will be worth more than they bought them for.
What happens?
Nobody can buy into the town, so another town is built near by, and the housing market collapses in the first town.
Not only that, the estate agents in the first town who facilitate the trade of the houses for money (exchanges and miners) stop making any money, as they only earn when houses are sold. And they leave the town for the town down the road.
Now you have a town, full of houses, they may be great houses, they may be solidly built, with good locks. But there are no estate agents.
Let's say in this town houses can't be bought or sold legally without an estate agent doing the paper work (miner), even if someone wants to sell and manages to find someone willing to buy, it will cost him a lot of money to get an agent to come over from the other town and will take a lot longer, and that's only assuming the agent even wants to.
I really can't make it any more simple than that I think.
If no houses are sold, the market collapses.

Plenty of major banks failed last time around. Some smaller ones were allowed to close up and everyone got their money. The bigger ones were taking over by the government and everyone got their money.
To big to fail, sure. Too big to be taken over and split up and absorbed into national banks, no. Banks aren't allowed to get that big. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:49:06
Yeah it's not often UK banking apps have issues. But they can always just phone or walk into a branch. Their money is fully protected. So long as you're not holding more than £100,000 in one checking account for long periods or £1m for short periods.
Spread your spending cash over more than one account and you're fine.

Digibyte is old, and well tested. 
It took Litecoins idea and went way further with it, then kept developing further and further.
Its the most secure, the most stable, one of the fastest and also one of the cheapest at $0.00000044 per transaction.
It also has a super friendly and welcoming community.

I'm sure most countries change the colour palette between notes, as well as the size. It makes them easy to recognise and distinguish between. 
And then when a new note comes out due to hyper inflation it makes sense to change the palette as well for the same reason, so that you don't mix a 100,000 in with a bunch of 1,000,000,000,000 and trick an unsuspecting shop keeper out of money if they don't spot it. Especially useful when you start weighing notes instead of counting them, that way you can just flick through for any the wrong colour before putting on the scales. 
£5 - Blue - small
£10 - Orange - medium
£20 - Purple - large
£50 - Red - XL
$5 - Purple - small
$10 - Blue - medium
$20 - Red - large
$50 - Orange - XL
$100 - Green - XXL
$1 - Green - Medium
$5 - Green - Medium
$10 - Green - Medium
$20 - Green - Medium
$50 - Green - Medium
$100 - Green - Medium

It's not immune. But the debit card system and the online banking system will be separate. It would require something catastrophic at AWS to take down both.
But that said, we all know about putting eggs in baskets. You must always put all of them into the same basket and hope it doesn't break ��

Bean gave a thumbs up to an American biker, who gave him the finger.
Of course nobody is ever rude, so he took it to be the American way of giving a thumbs up.
