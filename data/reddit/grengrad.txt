Yes, its on sale for only 11x the price it was 1 year ago and 2x the price 3 months ago. What a deal!

Alternatively, you could put half of your key in the sealed will, and give the other half of the key to 3 trusted friends/family members.
That way, only lawyer+family/friend can access the wallet, and it solves the problem of you dying at the same time as one of your trusted friends/family members, which can happen in the case of car crashes.

Know a guy that had a lot of BTC, and "diversified" into the top 20 alts near the end of last year to protect himself from the bubble potentially bursting. :(

The spread between the bid and the ask was 6% this morning, but has narrow to 3% as we approach the end of the US trading day. That is a pretty high trading cost at least for market orders.  
Today's volume so far is: 176K @ $33 = 5.8M USD (0.13% of the amount of BTC traded in the last 24 hours) and the security is up 2.7%.

Sticking with the analogy. I think Bitcoin is DVD right now, and I think it is working towards becoming Blu-Ray more than it is towards becoming streaming. Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but I think people over estimate it's chances of success, and how quickly it could hit certain pricing and acceptance levels.

If bitcoin is a speculative, volatile, unregulated investment, that you shouldn't put too much of your money into it, how does it become the money of the future?

Bitcoin would equal the USD M1 Monetary Supply at $200,000 per coin.  
Bitcoin would equal the USD M2 Monetary Supply at $800,000 per coin.  
Bitcoin would equal the value of all assets on earth at $11,000,000 per coin.  
  
Bitcoin is not going to be worth $10,000,000 per coin in your lifetime.  
Network effect is NOT exponential, it is sigmoidal.

Smart Contracts: I agree smart contracts have limited uses, but they DO have uses. For example, the global sports gambling industry could and should be disrupted and completely replaced with a smart contract based platform, because the house gets such a large portion (9.1%) of all sports wagers, and crypto could easily match bets and enforce the exchange at a significantly lower cost to the gambler.  
Fundamentals of Design: Fair points, thx.  
Network Effect: Network effect currently exists today with USD being one of the most valued fiat currencies, with the largest network, but many other currencies still exist and are used and valued.   
Individual investments are small potatoes compared to a Government entering Crypto, which is what will be required for Crypto to truly be mainstream. It's very possible if governments do ever choose to go with a Crypto as their official currency that it won't be the same one. I.e. if the European Union tomorrow decided to buy a ton of BTC and make it their official currency, it would be detrimental to the US or China to follow suit, since the EU got in first resulting in higher acquisition costs for the US Gov. It would be better value for the US or China to get in first on a different Crypto, and then try to push others to use it.

Great analysis and the last correction showed this (Bitcoin dropped). If Bitcoin wants to replace gold, it needs to become an asset people flee to in bad times. That takes people becoming as confident in Bitcoin as they are in other safety assets (Gold, US Treasuries, YEN, CHF, etc.), which has not happened yet.

How would Bitcoin have helped you in that situation?

I really doubt Afghanistan would make the top 500 wars in the last 2000 years.  
How does that stack up to the 30 Years War or World War I, or any of the major expansions, i.e. the Roman, Macedonian, Persian, Mongolian, Ottoman empires.

If that world comes to exist, then yes, but there is little evidence of that world yet, only a hope to get there.
  
Bitcoin only works as a store of value if it's price becomes stable and slowly and steadily grows over time, instead of boom and bust. People flipped out at the potential of their Money Market accounts going negative in 2008, and this would have been like 99 cents on the dollar (a 1% or less loss). The type of people that put money in CDs and Savings Accounts can't stomach occasional 50% drops that happen over the span of a month or two.
  
  
  
Gold is not just a store of value, but used as a flight to safety during dark financial times. I know, because I sold out of the market and went to 100% gold for a year in 2008/2009. Gold tends to go up if the stock markets endure an extended beating. So far, Bitcoin has not proved to behave this way. In the last minor market correction Bitcoin went down as stocks went down. For Bitcoin to replace gold, people have to see Bitcoin as a safe asset and flee from other assets to Bitcoin when times are dark. Right now people view Bitcoin as a risky asset and do the opposite.

I am just pointing out that the title is deliberately deceptive. I agree with you that interest in Crypto is rising, and that said interest has the potential to positively impact bitcoin's long-term price prospects.

The highest inflation the US has experienced in your 60 years is 14.8% in March of 1980.  
At the time the US Gov was selling 2 Year Treasuries yielding 14.63%.  
So, you could match the rate of inflation with investment gains.

Anything that does well has early years where growth appears to be exponential, but eventually settles into a sigmoidal curve, so comparing the early years of BTC to the late years of USA is silly.
  
The US was declared independent in 1776 with a GDP of ~150M. It currently has a GDP of 21T, for a gain of 14,000,000%. Not very relevant to how next year will go through, is it?
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:34:47
Are we calling a drop from 20K to 6.5K a little dip now?
People were saying the same thing you are saying at 12K, and at 10K, and at 8K.
Bitcoin is still priced 900% higher than it was 2 years ago. That is a great thing for people who bought 2 years ago, but not for people who are thinking about buying now.  
4 of the top 5 performing stocks of 2001 no longer exists as companies, all of which had huge gains. Turns out they were just part of a passing fad. They all had huge gains, and an article described the market as "one word: DVDs". Hollywood Entertainment a Video Store, was going to the moon. Turns out streaming would eventually replace that business and those stocks would be worthless.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:55:46
Yes, you should always care about trying to buy or sell at the best price, and buying at 3x the price you could have bought at means you have 1/3rd of the asset you think is going to do well. In real terms that might be the difference between driving a Focus vs a Mercedes.
Also, how is the 200K price target justified? What some guy on the internet said after spending 15 minutes making a chart based on past results?
  
There is a reason investment firms are legally obligated to say "past performance is no guarantee of future results." If only people on Reddit also had to say this.
  
At lot of mainstream people were involved in pushing Bitcoin to 20K, most of them bought in over 10K and got burnt badly. Crypto's market cap increased 550B in that run up in 2 months. Will people be willing to risk the amount of capital it would take to push the market up 5-6 trillion dollars to get bitcoin to that 200K target, or will they be concerned about getting burnt again and sell off well before that even if there is a significant rise. How many boom and bust cycles would it take to hit 200K and how many of those cycles will mainstream people put up with before they decide to just keep their money in an Index fund?
Finally, Bitcoin is not the only game in town. Will another technology supplant Bitcoin during that timetable. Sure you can diversify, but how much. If your target price is 10x current prices, you can invest in 5 investments, if you want to double your money, assuming the other 4 fail. If you buy in lower and now your target price is 30x current prices prices, then you can invest in 15 investments, greatly increasing your chances that one of the 15 investments meets your goal.
  
So, in conclusion, price matters a lot, no matter what your price target is, because a price target is a potential outcome, not a guaranteed outcome.

Unless you invest in things other than Crypto. Then, you can sell gains elsewhere and match them with losses from Crypto. You can sell lot specifically to do this.

Capitulation means surrender, it means when most people give up. As long as there are lots of people saying "HODL", "buy the dip", and "good time to buy", we probably have not reached capitulation.  
I can't say that I am not tempting to buy some at these levels, but it is probably not the bottom yet. There is a decent change of selling for tax losses through the end of the Gregorian Calendar (Dec 31st), and then another wave of sales prior to Chinese New Year (Feb 5th).

Of course people care, that's why they invest it in things they hope will match or outpace inflation (gold, stocks, bonds, ammo, bitcoin, etc.), instead of placing money under the mattress.
