What wording and mentally? I don't admit  fault. My coin was in their wallet not in gdax..  I had 2fn set up but never received a notification.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:09:19
When and how did they contact you?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:43:39
I'm still waiting for this to get resolved. Has anyone one had any progress?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:16
its been a month and still haven't heard from coinbase. Has anyone got any news?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:14:37
When coinbase froze my account I still had 2ETH and almost 1BTC. i really need them to give me access to my coins. If I don't get in before the 1st I'm going to lose my house. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:22:35
I think ilI get something back because the daily withdrawal limit is less then the amount I had. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:53:25
 Does anybody know how long they could hold our money without telling us what's going on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:54:11

@_date: 2017-11-26 12:37:09
I have no idea how i got there.. Attempted to go to gdax to make a purchase and landed there..
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:21:41
And to top it off all my cards  and accounts had to get cancelled. Can't even buy more,��
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:25:53
I think it was from a google search 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:33:57
Over 10 hours and no response from coinbase.com or gdax.com...My life savings gone and not a fucking thing..
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:10:23
Has coinbase or gdax messaged you? Its been a few hours and i haven got anything.. I feel like if I could have let them know the transfer could have been canceled 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:42:58
