yeah just tired of seeing it low
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:58:31
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:56:26
if this is a pull back next bull run will be intense. if not, sad bois everywhere
@_date: 2019-07-06 19:51:27
oh okay. also fuck you
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:02:11
how absurd do you think paper money seemed at first....?
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:28:54
we've probably got a bit of downtrending to go huh. guessing July will wobble like may
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:38:01
ok some basketball players make too much money also. $42m could do a lot of good for people who struggle.
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:25:34
just bought one thank you
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:36:34
waking up to an overal downtrend since end of july. I know everyone's super positive here but what if this is it? downhill from here I mean. bitcoin never pushes higher caps out around 10k.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:57:33
fuck yeah bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:08:31
those numbers make my stomach hurt. so many struggling people out here and there's some people playing around with unnecessary wealth.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:36:05
why tho
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:54:39
I guess you could call this trending up
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:20:01
any explanations for the drop?
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:24:58
oh ok
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:08:25
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:21:31
I think im just gonna ride the next bull run, sell at what I hope is the peak and then transfer during the dip while sweating my balls off.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:12:08
charts look not fine to me. but ok
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:35:07
got my palms read
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:35:16
don't get into it man. you may decide later you want to own your bitcoin. I fear robinhood could do some shady shit one day I own half of my bitcoin on robinhood. i want to sell it and transfer the money but that will take 6 days and what if bill run happens......you know?
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:02:01
HEALTHY UP TREND PATTERN ENGAGED. ALL SYSTEMS FUNCTIONING.
TO THE MOON IN 3...
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:37:31
bitcoin tanking tho
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:00:56
you hope my balls sweat so much they fall off? thanks "pal"
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:01:10
you're nice.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:11:53
it doesn't have to mirror 2018 tho
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:58:11
don't mean a thang
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:16:06
again fuck you
@_date: 2019-07-06 03:29:49
ok sure but the problem is uneven distribution of wealth so the solution is to throw money on the problem. I guess it's a matter of what money.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:19:31
40k by end of month
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:26:29
just want to see 15k tired of bitcoin being a slut
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:49:49
and a downtrend ensues. Why no go up :( 
sad boi hodl
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:09:30

@_date: 2019-08-27 08:59:41
dat chart tho
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:01:44
So yesterday I was jumping up and down at bitcoins run up today im looking at the charts and noticing a steady down trend. Since almost hitting 14k our highs keep descending. Somebody make me feel better pls.
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:58:35
@_date: 2019-08-10 19:57:49
to purchase and sell? cashapp is good but idk if it's the best
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:58:17
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:36:22
sale, crash, whats the difference
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:46:18
3 month chart, looking at Robin Hoods (not where i hold my coin), showed descending highs. Also I'm a noob.  I have faith in bitcoin... or at least block chain,  but i fear it's going to get bearish and beaten down hard before we moon, or another coin moons.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:05:07
2/3 bitcoin 1/3 options trading
@_date: 2019-08-08 13:59:12
*not where i hold my bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:52:33
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:32:44
im one of those pussies and i think were just comparing last year's chart to this years. I see a peak and descending highs. I understand that charts arent everything and bitcoin is fundamentally strong, but most people are irrational and probably see what im seeing and bitcoin i think will react to that. But im not an experienced invester, i havent sold and dont plan to but my butthole is certainly clinched.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:15:27
Can't you just sell your bitcoin...for cash?
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:26:12
any guides to protecting your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-22 03:02:11
leave the pope out of this
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:53:44
I dont know much about it. Bought a little probably going to sell soon too much uncertainty.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:42:23
you kidding me? first my bitcoin wasn't safe online, now its not safe on my ledger.  fokkin hell m8
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:48:34
Awesome.  Thanks for taking the time to help me I will be buying on coinbase now. I take it you're buying to hold not sell?
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:38:17
i hate it. i wants a time machine then maybe ill invest more.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:56:00
how do you feel about coinbase and cashapp
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:01:36
why the fuck coinbase not letting me buy shit? insufficient funds my ass......
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:01:52
what do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:51:36
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:05:21
you sure it's a huge wall? ...really all that big my dude...?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:32:56
Yeah I just want to buy now and sell when bitcoin is worth quadrillions. What are the perks of actually buying bitcoins as opposed to investing with robinhood?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:35
thanks scared noob here
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:41:20
Robinhood allows you to buy partial bitcoin. Can you do that the legit way?
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:48:36
any good guides for dummies on how to keep your bitcoin safe?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:30:38
So if I buy bitcoin of robinhood somebody could steal that? ...??
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:35:04
so close to profits. I'll wait and just put other money into bitcoin elsewhere, sell robinhood shit when it picks up a little more and then put it all into stocks.
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:56:23
ok I use coinbase and cashapp. I see a "ledger nano S wallet" looks like a USB. I buy this? I'm not too tech savvy will I have trouble figuring out how to get my coin on there?
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:36:10
sure wish I did the same. send me money
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:50:10
You just really made it seem shitty. Slow you say?
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:22:50
I really hope this makes me rich. So tired of struggling and watching my family struggle.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:37:27
Ok thanks
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:30:02
Stimulating the market I see. Again many thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:31:27
Thank you. I have trouble understanding the technical mumbo jumbo this makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:38
fuck coin base I can't buy this dip... why they down right now sad face
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:54:21
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:15:15
Why does it matter? Is bitcoin that unsecure?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:52:12
word up trying cash app but good to know
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:45:57
yeah just dropping big time. I'm scared
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:43:58
don't worry im straight. bills food covered. all fun money in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:13:55
Is robinhood safe?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:34:07
I keep hearing that. what does that mean hold in wallets you control and how do I do that?
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:46:35
inspiring. I think
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:02:42
I see you're an old head using the slang hodl. I thought your phone was auto correcting...incorrectly. 
By spend and replace what do you mean? Sell at highs for profit and buy dips or actually use bitcoin to buy things?
PS: I cant believe you're not annoyed with me yet.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:30:02
I know I probably shouldn't be meddling here because this is way over my head I'm just a lowely construction worker. But...could you put this in dummy words?
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:02:44
yeah I don't really know what I'm talking about just grasping straws here. thanks for your response.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:40:12
it will give back up right :C
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:50:51
:/ I get the whole do your own research thing I just want opinions from real people here. I will check it out tho
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:38:55
jk bitcoin playing games
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:10:51
whats all the talk. we all know its crashing. buy the bottom if no moon then sell on confirmation of crash
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:43:30
yeah. I dont have much to invest now. have about 10% of a bitcoin. adding a little each paycheck.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:11:44
I'm not going to sell immediately even though I may be risking. I'm negative as far as gains goes bought a lot at the recent high like a dumb noob. probably not wise to try and predict but I'm going to.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:38:19
exchange attack? what that
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:34:34
weres my fockin moon
