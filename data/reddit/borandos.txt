You are making a lot of money with it, it's not enough for you? None of the banks could match it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:56:10
I had the same issue with one of my bank accounts (Santander) but for my other bank account it worked fine. So try it for a different one. Also do it on the website is better then in the app, IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:25
It's a little similar to VIX futures IMO. With BTC futures you will able to get BTC at a lower price in the future say 6 months from now then actually what it will be so you have instant profit or you could just sell your futures. With BTC futures you could also hedge your BTC holdings.

Is there a barcode you can scan?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:58:52
Get a camera/phone, take a picture front and back and upload it to your computer. It should work then. Blurry picture is not acceptable and it shouldn't have glare either.

I am investing on GDAX. For $800 worth of BTC the commission was around $2.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:01:22
Try billions, my name is Trump.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:51:23
Is there a transfer fee when you use cash from Coinbase on GDAX and vice versa? Is comission fees are better on GDAX if I only buy a small amount on Bitcoin? Do you use the same credetials to login on GDAX if you already have an account on Coinbase? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:10:37
And they scoop them too, except they have more money. I think they take out the limit sell orders. For this reason I wouldn't put in limit sell orders for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:10:14
With $ I pretend to sell my BTC and on the bottom it gives me the $ value. Of course I don't execute the trade. I also use the Blockfolio app on my phone (someone suggested in this sub).
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:47:19
You can see the charts (free) at [Cryptowatch](
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:28:58
Sounds like Bitchcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:41:16
Buy it on the USD market and sell it on the AUD market.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:35
Probably already do it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:41:31
It'll be definitely bubble when hookers start to accept BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:29
Yes, even I can understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:37:40
Gemini and Bitstamp are low too. I'm on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:08:02
I couldn't link my bank in the app but on the website I had no problem. Try to do it on the website if you haven't tried it yet. Don't you have a driver's license, use that as an ID.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:01:10
How much monthly income do you generate?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:00:02
Try Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:04:35
I am paying around 0.25% fees. No transfer fee from Coinbase (GDAX is owned by Coinbase but fees are much lower). Transferring money from bank account is 4-5 days. On Coinbase you can use CC instantly (higher fees). Check out FAQs on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:03:21
I should buy and sell on GDAX then because the fees are killing me on Conbase. I am new to this. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:41:47
Nooooooo, up, see already.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:10:04
I wish they had more indicators like Bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:12:03
Pay attention when you link your Debit/Credit card and/or Bank Account(s). There will be two small amounts debited to your account that you have to enter (on Conbase's website or app).
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:07:14
Thanks, I already signed into GDAX and transferred my coins and I like it already. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:35:16
I felt the same way 3 weeks ago and since then I already made $100 profit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:47:43
Why do you want to lose money?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:58:03
Why don't you trade on GDAX, commissions are a lot less and GDAX is owned be Coinbase so you can use the same credentials.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:15:32
Keep it and add more.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:26:01
Good luck. BTC is going to pop soon IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:01:29
On way or the other they make money. Is there any other way to deposit funds (without fees)?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:25:19
Take some when it's high and put it back when it's low.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:08:41
Locked out for one bank account but you can try to link another one in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:50:09
I made a similar mistake, sold everything but luckily bought it back with a small loss after I realized that this doesn't go anywhere except up in the long term. I would get in now and leave it there and get used to the short term volatility when price fluctuates. Bitcoin can be very volatile in the short term but unless you are a day-trader don't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:35:06
If you have BTC and buy puts you will hedge your BTC holdings but you will also lower your profit if BTC keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:31:07
Have you reached your weekly limits?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:01
I like that :&gt;)))
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:40
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:40:16
Should show up immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:57:54
The ones I see in Coinbase are highly correlated so I am not sure what would be the point at this time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:32:35
What's your payment method, CC, Debit Card or Bank Account?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:14:59
At Coinbase you have one Bitcoin Wallet and also a Bitcoin Vault and that is even safer.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:17
Traders are selling (like crazy), investors are holding. It will go back up again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:44:09
Don't rush buying, it will probably go down more and you will able to get it cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:37:22
Then, that's what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:41:16
Try another payment method if all else fails.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:01:37
Btc is a lot less risky then options. No expiration, less volatility and more profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:15:12
I use Google Authenticator, my Driver's license for verification and PIN to lock the screen and it works fine. The Driver's license verification took for a long time, I lost my patience took a shower and after that it was done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:44:13
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:23
Link your bank account(s) and just transfer your money from your Bitcoin Wallet into it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:04
You are probably right.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:20:50
I use Coinbase and I like it. I choose it because it's popular and has reputation. I don't even know what else is out there. [Maybe this helps](
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:59:13
What do you use for verification? Do you log in on multiple computers?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:21
I think futures will drive up Bitcoin even more.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:34:47
Is it linked correctly? Have you used it before?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:54:51
In the past two weeks I put in $600. I am hoping the same :&gt;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:41:59
I just got in myself with a lot less then you. I wish I had started with cryptocurrencies much earlier. In the meantime I will keep adding to my portfolio and see it growing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:17
Probably with Bitcoin futures.
