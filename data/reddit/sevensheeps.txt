That's fast. I didn't want to be hard on you seeing that you are new but uploading my ID is a big step for selling photo's. I hope you didn't get my honesty for hostility. Thanks for listening, I got you bookmarked. I'll check for some photo's (I have plenty) this week so I can help you test the beta stage of your project. :)
Goodluck! 
Edit: wait, I still need a Usecrypto account. Which requires you to upload ID. I understand this is for your local laws but my ID is valuable sensitive information that I don't want to give away to anyone. Is there a possibility that you let people fill in their own wallet address without having to sign up at Usecrypto? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:48:29
Professional designer here, I'll give you some feedback. I'm not going to upload my ID. There are many similar sites that offer what you offer and there is no uploading of ID required.

I unsubbed after Theymos made that statement about 90% of us should go if we disagree with what is going on. I think that was very disrespectful. I subbed the other subreddits but they are mostly bitching about this sub. I really didn't enjoy that. I just want to read the developments in Bitcoin world and talk about it from time to time. I have no real opinion about the block size debate, accept that it should be what is best for Bitcoin and it should be future proof. But after everything I still lurk and I still disagree wholeheartedly with how this sub is moderated. This policy turned the sub into a segregated community. I hope they will relax a bit one day, cause I really liked this sub. It was a very nice place, where everyone could discuss what they loved the most. A decentralised future, instead of a centralised dystopian one. This sub should reflect those values I think. 
I really hope I don't get banned for saying this.

I've said this yesterday and I'll say it again. The reason we use Uranium over Thorium is because Uranium-based reactors produce Plutonium, handy for making nuclear weapons. Thorium doesn't have the same 'benefit'. Back in the days we didn't have the capability to make Thorium go critical. So instead Uranium reactors got developed during the Manhattan project. After that, cold war politics took over and big money was established in the Nuclear industry. Uranium is far more scarce than Thorium, he who controls the spice controls the universe kinda thing. Everyone with acces to money and the ability to proces large amounts of sea water can make Thorium powered reactors in todays world. The top commenter on that thread is neglecting these facts. He ignored me after I presented him with written history. I hate the shillery that happens on reddit sometimes.. 
Edit: formatting.

Thanks for the lesson learned! To expand on my comment, very exciting massive leap for Bitcoin. All of the big financial institutions in The Netherlands, mah country recognised Bitcoin is not just a 'thing' anymore for the masses. I find this fascinating for 'something' that was just a 'thing' for a long time now. With all the investments in Bitcoin startups, the gradual adoption and just all the good news in general these are very exciting times! :) I am very proud to live where I live, I had goosebumps when I saw it on tv.

Your assumptions are correct my friend! Thank you for your very constructive well made post!! This is the kind of information I can use to professionalize my story in the case I'm writing!  
And the non reversal of transactions will be no problem. We are an honest company, we will look at the complaint and give them a redeposit.

Cryptocurrencies were created by and for people who have simply had enough. They’ve seen the way the world is going and rather than grumble or pretend it’s not happening, they’ve decided instead to make a new one!

I like using Circle and Multibit, I use Circle as a hot wallet because they are insured and the UX/UI is very pretty and minimalistic and it's fast. And Multibit, because it's very robust, I never had any problems.  
You are downloading the entire Blockchain with the core wallet, Multibit does not do this. There are other wallets that you can use, check the sticky top of the frontpage of r/bitcoin. 
Take care. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:43:30
You're missing the point, it doesn't cost us a thing. It's already payed for and it will not increase cost at all. Looking at the bitpay site it will be only a matter of html integration and a small fee, chum. I will  pay for that fee out of my own pocket. In my eyes it's pure opportunity for zero extra cost. I want to show him how easy it is for everyone and how much independence it will give our region he doesn't care about the numbers.

@_date: 2014-01-04 15:25:07
I see this as an opportunity to make this regional economy booming again with the help of bitcoin. 
I think it bitcoin as a business case by itself shows massive opportunity for a very very minimal amount of labour. Cost wise it's better then the 'old' mediums of payment and leads to more revenue because it's cheaper overall. And it lead to revenue trough financial independence for the people.  Here in Holland, it's getting accepted nation wide. People are careful mostly because of the 'difficulty' with the average non user and getting comfortable with how too use it. 
So as a business case, these are very simular to our business values. We take up existing initiatives , fill it and combine them .                            Our role is complementary to the creative sector itself, with the aim to increase the visibility and connect business. Emphatically we want to connect and catalyse facilitation between the creative industries and other sectors. 
It will help the people, not us. We are already here, we get financial aid for our government for the website. I think bitcoin is perfect for this! (=

That's rich people, you need to impress people visually, minimals amount of words on the screen where you can. Most of them are not nostalgic with kid/toy cyberpunk slides. 
This is a modern presentation made by me for a board of directors of a very big newspaper agency 
I'm not trying to troll here I swear, I'm just very surprised they showed that during their pitch at the value Investor's Congress.  You get my point? I'm not saying the content of the presentation isn't very well thought of. Because it is. 
Now if you want to have fun in a presentation (young people 30+ in the music scene) but keep it serious at the same time you can do this (phase is spelled the wrong way but I used a corrected one in the final presentation) 
 
Or as a follow up

Could be, but I think this is cool to see all the (old) giant financial institutions in our country open to Bitcoin (because their model is obviously flawed and they will be crushed if they don't). We could have been in a country where they would crack down on everything crypto related. It's even cooler to see this in the news followed by more than a million people who probably most of them have not heard of Bitcoin, as a early adopter I think this is a huge step from the negative news 2 years ago.

She just displayed her work in a three day city wide exposition, and it was very good for her exposure. Sales are going good, some of the jewellery is sold and a few plates. And she got a bunch of orders out of it.I'm happy for her! 
She's considering bitpay integration atm but for now she's going to hold it indefinitely, if she needs some money for any work related reasons she will first try to find online or offline store that deals in bitcoin, she wants to use the bitcoin economy instead of converting it to fiat. I have some tweaking to do on the home page and the shop function she didn't want is already waiting for upload to the server, she my friend and I did all the work for free (= 
She got her first tip yesterday, it wasn't much but that didn't matter. I saw her face when she received a small amount, it was priceless.

I agree to a certain extend, I think there can be others ways we can look at profit. What is profit and how can we redefine profit is an important question I think? Open, uncensored, decentralised human communication is in my eyes profitable for us as species. 


Yes I've been reading up about storj, the person who came up with this idea is a genius in my eyes. 
Sorry if it's a stupid question, talking about a social media network based on mesh networks where everyone can communicate freely. During the Arab spring revolutions governments took down social media networks to stop communication, are mesh networks immune to this?

Some people don't care about their privacy, some people do. Coinbase does a lot for Bitcoin and I respect that. Not everyone is a crypto anarchist, you should respect that. I made my mum a circle account today so she can play with very small amounts of Bitcoin, I don't see her creating multisig paperwallets for cold storage. If you want widespread adoption you have to realise that companies such as Coinbase have to operate by the law of the land. Even if those laws are stupid or unethical atm.
Edit: I wanna clarify 'unethical' I don't mean them getting away with genocide or such matters.

I went to the doctor and he said it's fine, it's my choice and I shouldn't listen to people like you. People like you need to realise that not everyone will leave their coin in cold storage etc. When BTC goes mainstream more people will use these services because they are user friendly and accessible. I use Circle because they are insured, I have a Multibit wallet for the rest of my coins.

Okay I can understand that, but what you said is a bit ridiculous and does not back up to this. 




True to a certain extent, it was the US government that revoked Snowden's passport that marooned him in Russia. This was after trying to raise concerns internally using the process for Whistle-blowers. The documents Snowden had were leaked through well regarded media and treated a him more like a brand because that is how you get to the general population if you market something the 'right way'. And yes William Binney was the original NSA leaker( and more) but even William Binney called Snowden a true patriot. It is the other media outlets that change and make-up stories to convince you that he is not a patriot. All whistleblowers are equally important! 
If you see this for the fifth time, that's not so good, just downvote and move on. I haven't seen it and I'm on these boards quite some.

Yes they do, for example at the start of the video she asks the crowd who works at ABN AMRO and then who works with Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. She says to the bank employees to have a look at the people working with Bitcoin/Blockchain technologies because they might even be in control of the financial system and not "us". I think that is fucking amazing to hear from a bank the size of ABN AMRO.

I wish we could use the hashing power of Bitcoin for finding cures for diseases (folding proteins), search for radio signals or help us understand physics (CERN). A cryptocurrency that builds distributed computing into the Blockchain. The miners would get rewards for their contributions to  projects, and the findings would be as public as the currency's ledger etc. I don't know if it's feasible but a man can have his dreams. :)

Probably CERN.

He's a big fat pump and dumper, attention craving nobody, most of his retweeting on twitter is done by bought aka [fake followers]( He's just trying to stay relevant. It's kinda sad to see actually.

Anyone? I could use some help here. Google searching is just to widespread and I hoped by asking reddit to get a little professional help from my fellow early adopters.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:57:08
I'll definitely look into that! 
Is it smart to accept multiple crypto currencies or is bitcoin the 'only way to go'. 
Thank you for your help vehirion. 
Anyone else feeling helpful today? (=

It only got better my friend, things have changed in this city. The basic layout is still the same though (= You should give her a visit again, especially now this month it is beautiful! Lights everywhere, food markets everywhere, good cafe's and bars and nightlife. The river lighting up golden because of all the xmass lights hanging on the bridges. We gained a few new ones in the last 20 years. Big project going on to get the big highway crossing the city underground, turning the former highways into parks. Semi modernised the city centre, 50% new 50% old. The city is truly alive. (=

We live in between nations, as a kid the taught me English, French and German. Your words are kind as speak of heart, as a resident I can confirm your good words (= 
If you can, you should go. 
She won't disappoint you!

Looks like a nice place to live! I'm new on reddit, recommend a good art subreddit?

I think Bitcoin can give me an opportunity to get funds for my dream to print my art for exposure at art galleries. What I really love to do is create something that makes people think about today. We are not really at a pleasant part in human history. I try to make a difference by trying to get people to think to how we our treating our planet and ourselves.  Check it out, what do you think? Do you share my dream? I love to hear your opinion!

Bitcoin it is &lt;3 I'm in it for the long term so the risk is something that is love to take. I believe in bitcoin. I let everyone know trough my facebook that I am accepting donations for now and it fell really well. When I first announced it I expected a more fierce discussion about the coin (as usual) but people really took it in and I think that is a telling tale of things to come. I also hope that I can 'convince' others to start accepting bitcoin by leading by example. 
As soon as I hold enough coin I will spread my assets in like you advised me, I think it is very smart idea! 
I signed up for bitpay, now time to integrate some HTML (=

Allright then I'll try to find my way, I wish more people would respond to my questions. 
Have a good day. 
Peace.

I dunno where you live but it is beautiful there! I really like you nature photo's! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:59:32
I have a receiving adres on my contact page to donate Bitcoin so I can make my world a better place. (; The next step of course is for my clients to pay me in bitcoin. 
And bitpay is really helpful, I went trough it and there are a lot of good options for insta plugin pleasure (= 
I'll put a QR code on my site too! You have some amazing photo's on you portfolio! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:22:09
Is there a site that I can add myself to because I work for bitcoin? 
What things do I need to know when I start accepting bitcoin for business?
