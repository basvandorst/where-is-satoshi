'The fact I'm right' LOL. Why would I  bother arguing with such arrogance. 
People have been saying BTC will crash for the last 5 years.

I don't have the time to argue with conspiracy theorists.

Approaching 19k... and another sell wall.

Climbing... big green wall on GDAX.

You really do sound like you have no idea. Go invest in penny stocks and coins and hope they x10000000.

Bitcoin is currently not usable as a currency... it's too volatile, fees are too high and transactions take too long. That's said as a BTC supporter.

That's not a spelling error lol. You're just not quite all there.
