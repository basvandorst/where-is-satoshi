It's still $2500 on livecoinwatch.com. Am I missing something?

Man I feel bad for those people. I was also reading r/btc during that pump and some of their arguments and posts were pretty convincing and looks like a lot of people got scared and sold their Bitcoin. Lesson learnt I hope.

I was reading a thread on r/vertcoin and the poster was saying that he was listening to radio in Korea on the way home and they were taking taking about the big conspiracy of Bitcoin cash and how people have lost money. It must feel like shit to be in that position right now.

For someone to make money, someone had to lose it. Who lost?

I understand your point about tangible goods but there are people who bought Bitcoin cash at $2500 and now it's worth $1300. Even if they sell now, they are $1200 worse off per coin. 
People were putting actual money in to pump the price up and then sold at peak to make huge profits. Not everyone sold at peak and they are going to lose. I was trying to find out if my logic is correct or I am missing something?

So the best thing to do for a newbie is to buy the coins and then transfer then to my desktop wallet?

I just deposited $8k AUD in my exchange and bit hesitant to pull the trigger. It feels like the price will come down bit more before going up again. Am I silly to wait?

What do you mean by relay protection?

Can you please explain what happened with Bitcoin cash? Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:23:29
Thanks man. Sorry about your loss.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:07:12
Thanks, I will look into it. Cheers

If I am saving my Bitcoin in Electrum desktop wallet. Is that safe or should I be looking at some other option? Cheers

I looked at this but the price was quite a bit more to what the actual going rate is? I am new to this, did I miss anything? Cheers
