Keep fighting the good fight however it's disheartening to see just 2 people protesting while the rest of you just shout at the CEO from behind your keyboards.   Massive dumping with price currently below $325...

Two minds think alike.  I, too, was thinking of quoting that part.

Can you post screen shots of this alleged chat?
Also, since I don't know the structure of the brazzers/mofos network, are you sure that  is the address you need to sign up through normally or did you follow that link because of the thread

Pardon me for a moment.  What education/work experience best prepares you for call center management? 
If you can think of 3 suggestions on how a call center employee can best impress management and get promoted, what would you advise they focus on?   Disclosure: I am not a call center employee but am interested in the domain.

Wow you have a farm?  Do you grow crops or raise animals?

Me too, I have someone close to me who sends me links to negative news that seems to validate their view that bitcoin is a ponzi, a waste of time and money.  Their tone comes across as 'told you so'.    This time the question was how much have I lost in BTC.  If I sell today, sure I would be at a slight loss because I bought into the hype in Jan, converted to an alt coin and didn't sell at the top, but at least I didn't lose any at Gox.  
While I think it's good to be realistic about the dangers that surround the use of cryptocurrencies, how do you deal with this kind of pessimism?  The person cannot be cut out of my life completely but I've tried to distance myself in recent months.

May I suggest https:// and adding more transparency about who you are on the site?  


If I had lost money on gox I would hesitate submitting personal info like my email address, location and btc lost, not to mention IP which I imagine many won't mask when visiting your site

Can I assume you have to be verified and send them fiat to do margin trading or can you just have fiat on your unverfied btc-e account (from coins sales) and not verify?

Ha ha, this reminds me of George and his 'opposite' theory.  Can you give some specifics where people derided your decisions and you came out a winner anyway?

True, it's all about convincing new recruits to join and buy in, then brainwashing them into believing they'll strike it rich, when in fact the value of the coin continues to drop and in the end, if these newbies buy and hold, they'll lose their shirts.  Notice how the founders and promoters are nowhere to be found on that subreddit nowadays.

lol, grumpy cat comes to mind when I see that. 
by the way, how about offering Dorian royalties for every shirt printed with his likeness?

Psst, you may want to correct the typo.
Edit: to the people signing the petition with their full names, city and country, be aware that you've published your personal info on the net and recognize the risks of doing so.

what do you use to strip exif data?

Do you know how long it takes for a wire to be deposited onto your gox account?   I don't have one yet but am considering it, I also wonder how long it takes to get verified

Oops sorry I glossed over the part you said you called the toll free number.  While btc is supposed to offer more privacy than paying via cc, unfortunately it can't be reversed.
Have you submitted an email using their contact form or PMed with your concerns?  Maybe he? has a contact at mindgeek that could help sort this out
Edit:  I went to brazzers.com to test out this issue and was directed to  Guess what?  There's a similar sign up page except no bitcoin payment type.  Therefore I wonder if  .. is an affiliate and that btc payment is not yet integrated on their main site?  
Weird...it would blow (no pun intended) if someone disappeared with any btc collected from that iknowthatgirl.com portal

Well I tried to ignore for a few days and ended up caving.  I basically replied saying that I keep up regularly with crypto news and that Gox users should have done more research before deciding to leave large amounts of coins and fiat on an uninsured exchange.  Oh and thanks for asking but I didn't have any on Gox, although I avoided disclosing my slight loss as I feel that's none of their business.  
I then went on to suggest best practices including keeping coins offline.  I suspect my reply will fall on deaf ears.
