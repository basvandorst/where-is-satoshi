Good explanation! Upped!

I had an issue as well and they called me today and went over the order details to confirm it. I believe they'll either resubmit my order Monday or refund me so I can resubmit it myself. Either way, excellent customer service so far!

It will go to private buyers. Don't expect these coins to show up on an exchange.

we all should imo!

4 weeks, same canned responses. Lost 5 BTC... Bummer :(

I've been communicating with Rees since October 30th about my 5 BTC purchase that was flagged/canceled. Still no resolution.... Pretty upset as I'm level 2 with a CC and have been dealing with and promoting their service for months. 
Also, only weeks before that when they accidentally sent double the coins for one of my orders I quickly refunded the account and made it right.

yep down...

I've been waiting since Oct 25th to have my issue resolved. No money, No BTC.

I love this woman

Yeah i've transacted plenty of bitcoins over a few months with zero issues. This comes up randomly now and I get almost no help?!
I love the service but calling any of my transactions high risk after months of perfect transactions is completely wrong. 
I kind of understand "new members" having issues with high risk but I don't see why customer service can't quickly close out issues with verified level 2 members...
