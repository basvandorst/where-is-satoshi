Ha, NXT has user issued assets. OP is talking about Market-pegged assets only BitShares X is going to offer that. It is being released this month and it is revolutionary. Their blockchain also puts NXT to shame
Look at comparison chart  
(I actually own NXT but got to keep it real)

Mary Magdalene maybe. Also when he threw over the tables of the money changers exploiting the population outside the temple. He was 'having a bitch' then ;)

Yeah to send a transaction in ripple, you need to be in a car with a glass of water and wait for a T-Rex start walking up behind you. Sucks. 
(Yeah for me Ripple is centralised and huge potential inflation cuz of pre-mine. You constantly have to worry some owner going to sell their stake  )

NXT pretty good,  but BitShares is much better. 
(Look at the comparison chart at the bottom.)

They can simply do a snapshot stock swap if they needed to switch over sooner. Bitcoin has a centralisation of mining problem. As well as an expenses problem. It's bleeding red, 10% inflation + transaction fees in exchange for decentralisation it doesn't provide. DPOS blockchain charges 100x less than Bitcoin and gives shareholders 5% dividends - Amazing things happen when you remove greedy ASIC miners.

BitShares X - It's coming!
A decentralised bank &amp; exchange which allows the trading of derivative assets that track the value of real world counterparts. Now real world currencies, commodities and stocks can be tracked in decentralised digital form &amp; held in market-pegged, collateralised, derivative assets which are traded on a blockchain without counterparty risk or trusted price feeds. 
BitShares X is currently pre-trading on bter and BTC38 under 'BTSX' and is expected to be released within the month.

With the amount of development innovation and investment, crypto-currency is only going one way. What's more worth paying attention is Bank run in Bulgaria last week, Portugal bank failing on bond payment etc. Cyprus made Bitcoin shoot up 2013 - any major bank confiscations will make Bitcoin shoot so high so fast, you'll break your neck trying to follow the price on a graph.

Of course $ &gt; Bitches. If you put Bitches&gt; $ you'd run out of $ and $0 = 0 bitches. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:01:24
Yeah people with money are realising their stuff is about to get jacked. (Confiscations - Insolvent banks and governments) so they suddenly start to see the value of Bitcoin. Having said that Russia has low public debt and has many natural resources but still...

It can handle more if needed &amp; plus demand will be spread over multiple blockchains with cross chain trading support. Also the point is to remove HFT.

Um, WTF!? BitShares X is doing exactly what you want! They're doing the final dry runs at the moment. Using prediction markets and collaterised market pegged assets, you're going to be able to effectively hold USD on a blockchain without needing to trust  some centralised 3rd party like 'Real Coin'. It's already in pre-trading as BTSX on bter and BTC38.

Wow it's so anonymous I just bought something from myself and I didn't even realise!

Desperate times call for desperate measures. Mastercard can see they're completely obsolete now. What else did you expect them to do?

Currency is not money. Money is gold, silver or Bitcoin something that is limited and can't be made out of thin air. 
Bank notes used to be receipts for money (Gold) because otherwise they'd just be worthless pieces of paper. Since 1971 they've just been worthless pieces of paper  and no paper currency has ever lasted more than 50 years even though there's been over 3000 attempts.

Nasdaq will be a distant memory in &lt;7 years imo.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:10:42
But Bitcoin got first mover advantage, dominant position and market penetration, so good for them I say! I do think BitShares market pegged 'BitAssets' - being able to hold BitUSD or BitGold on a blockchain - will change everything though! If they work, Bitcoins days are probably numbered imo, was fun while it lasted though! 
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:14:54
Ok maybe not a distant memory. But BitShares X offers all of that with privacy, security from confiscation and many other advantages. With the coming collapse of fiat currency and the desperation of governments, (IRA's already being targeted, bond exit fees, increased taxes, confiscation - Why stay on Nasdaq?)
