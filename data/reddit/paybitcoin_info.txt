I never knew about that, and agree that a decentralised solution is better than my service.

I find that these links are easier to use for a few reasons:
1. If your wallet is on your phone and the address is sent to you on your computer using this service you can scan the given QR code.
2. You can give out your PayBitcoin address without even opening your wallet and copy-pasting the address, including when you're outside.

Great points. Again, it is the user's choice. I for one find it convenient, and have [real life uses for it]( Those who are sceptical might still want to use it for one-off transactions rather than placing long term trust in the site. I can only promise to never act maliciously, and hopefully gain reputation over time.

No, I meant to post it under the same account as the OP, to provide more details.

Thanks for your feedback. Decentralization is the goal of Bitcoin, however many people choose to trust exchanges and web wallets to hold their Bitcoins. This service requires far less trust than one of those services would, and is available for those who decide to use it.

Thanks and I understand your decision. The entire Bitcoin model (exchanges, web wallets, etc) is trust based to an extent so as with any other Bitcoin-related site it will have to gain trust over time.
