1. With great power comes great responsibility. Services will provide for easier use at the price of liberty or choice; this exists now, look at the mass popularity of Coinbase, for example.
2. This is a feature, not a bug. Bitcoin first needs to establish value and be a store of value before it's used as a currency. It could be Bitcoin ends up primarily used as a reserve currency, backing other cryptos. People have not had incentive to save money for a long time, because inflation is a hidden tax. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, so I am not certain that prior issues with deflation apply. Regardless, Fiat is not going anywhere. There are thousands of currencies in use every day. Up until a decade ago, there was only one gold. Bitcoin is digital gold now.. with the bonus it can be transmitted. I use Bitcoin for many purchases that are not possible to do with credit cards.
3. This is a technology problem, not a Bitcoin problem. Bisq is one answer. There will be others. Ultimately your government behaving shitty is your problem, not Bitcoin's. Bitcoin is global.
4. Bitcoin seems to be well known and long past critical mass. Hang on.

Centralized coins can be controlled because there are people who you can put in jail, threaten, or kill.

@_date: 2019-07-23 17:29:03
Bitcoin empowers you to decide what happens with your money. Nothing more nothing less.
Infinitely divisible doesn’t alter the value of the object. It just means you can sell smaller pieces of it.. and if they end up being worth more, that is a deflationary function. The total supply never changes.
Bitcoin is legal. It’s math. Regulation is likely limited in nations controlled by the rule of law to its integration with fiat (buy/sell). Eventually you will not need to buy or sell Bitcoin with fiat.
People only have to see Bitcoin as a safe store for their wealth for it to succeed. Nobody spends gold.. and it’s worth about 7T.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:55:42

Nobody can predict what is happening. The market is too small and growing too quickly. 
The only thing that is certain, is bitcoin is very likely to be worth much, much more in the future.. or zero. 
Buy what you can afford to laugh about losing, and build a position with money you’d otherwise waste. Consider it fees paid for entertainment value here.
This approach is what I have done, and do now. I bought at $1k, $3k, $14k and $17k .. but over time that adds up.

This. The current state of affairs is temporary.
The volatile swings are also the BTC being spread around; as less whales exist or trade, the price will also stabilize.
The first step is establishing value.
The next step is establishing what value represents market equilibrium. We are here.

The actual jump to $100k will be a asymptote.
Once big bags want to get filled and the supply dries up - there just isn’t that much on the books - the price will move geometrically.

Bitcoin doesn’t have to take value to have value.
Bitcoin’s market cap is around $200B. This does NOT mean $200B has been invested. It means, for current trade volume and liquidity, that is its value - if you bought at a lower price, poof, wealth has been created!
Bitcoin at $20T likewise does NOT mean most fiat has been converted.

Bitcoin fundamentally disrupts the whole financial system as we know it. Banks aren’t stupid.
The problem is when enough people do this it hurts the funds banks can loan out. Every $1 you put into BTC is $10 they can’t loan out. A lot of people are using Bitcoin as a savings account. 
$100m out of the banking system is $1B that can’t be loaned. Those will impact profits.

It's fucking amazing that people have agreed there is any value whatsoever to these balances on the distributed ledger.
I'm old enough to have seen a few technology cycles. I believe quite firmly BTC is another one of these core technologies. Lots of technologies don't make it. I think Bitcoin .. just might.

There's literally millions of small investors. Perhaps, even, 10s or 100s of millions of investors. This dwarfs the "whales" and is part of the transition. Every 1000BTC dumped on the market is another 1000BTC that is distributed around and is further decentralized.

Nano Ledger S. As a victim of Gox, I break out in hives with the thought of leaving BTC on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:58:28
This is technically correct if you assume perfect market knowledge. If you have no idea, and trust me, nobody has any idea, then DCA is a good approach for most people.
This also assume market liquidity and ease of transaction. When BTC starts moving, you get transactions piling up, problems moving fiat into crypto exchanges, etc etc.
Those things complicate the analysis also. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:04:30
I don't think you understand what that means. The growth in bitcoin IS thew growth in wallets, even if it's .00001 or 100BTC.

Satoshi fully expected BTC to potentially reach a million dollar valuation, and actually suggested people hold some reflecting that possibility, as a lotto ticket of sorts.
Bitcoin will transfer lots and lots of wealth as it distributes. This is a good thing for Bitcoin, as it will drive distribution.
Once a valuation is established, systems for transferring small amounts - down to individual Satoshis - will emerge, like LN. Operating on different layers.
From there, you will get your electronic cash system. This was also predicted, right from the horse's mouth, Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:34:57
Bitcoin is the antithesis to what companies like Facebook and Youtube want. LN means you can pay content creators a few satoshis directly -  no need for ads or central content "management" aka censorship. The exciting thing for me about bitcoin isn't the ability to send large sums, it's the ability to send very small ones without any middlemen.
Bandwidth is cheap. Bitcoin means you can fund creators directly. That alone will mean moon.

Track the growth in wallets appearing on the blockchain. The second derivative of that curve is a excellent predictor.
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:09:35
First off, I doubt many people will purchase much with the core chain. 
Second, I think most of the items purchased will will be virtual and likely micropayments. This is a hugely underestimated impact, as it has the potential to decouple advertising from internet content.  Everyone hates ads. LN means you can pay people a few pennies automatically instead of looking at ads.. without subscriptions and hassles. Do you have any idea how big the advertising market is?
Third, nobody has to buy anything for something to have value. If enough people want BTC because it makes them feel fuzzy to own some, then that in itself is enough. You can get pretty far just on that; Gold has a substantially higher market cap, and most of the physical gold will never used to buy anything at all, or even be made into anything.. and gold can't easily be subdivided, verified, or sent distances.

The node will consume almost no extra electricity. I run mine on a Surface that has a broken screen. You can use a pi, a notebook, or even your PC.
You are not mining. That is pointless on a PC. You just help verify blocks and put an upvote on the confidence of the network. The largest impact is you need 190GB to store the current blockchain. 
There's great tutorials on [bitcoin.org]( and I'm happy to help here as I am quite sure others are as well.
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:22:38
Panic sell. Unload that shit. I need to accumulate more.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:31:57
Only until difficultly adjusts. Then it’s all equal. Brilliant system.
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:44:10
LN is about as proof-of-stakey as you can get. But that's not for this topic, please.
Absolutely, be mindful of bandwidth use, particularly when syncing the first time.
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:00:11
You need to download the blockchain; that's 190GB.
By definition, the blockchain increases block by 1MB max, and it's optimially around 10min/block.
So That's around 4320MB/mo increase. (4320 blocks/mo) (\~4.3GB).
You can see the growth here: [
Also keep in mind, this is how the blockchain distribution is made - so if you open up to other miners, there will be more bandwidth associated with the replication of the chain.
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:03:48
Hell, I'd be super happy if the price collapsed - as I could build a much better position more quickly.
Short term BTC is just gambling. If you have any vision at all for the potential, you hodl.
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:14:24
1) Nope. You do, however, get to validate your transactions yourself - and contribute to the reliability of the network. Worth more than a few Satoshis, I think. However, once you've downloaded the blockchain, you're able to do things like run a Lightning Node - and with that you most certainly earn some Satoshis. So a step towards that goal. Running a LN node is still pretty hairy for your average user.
2) Pi3 yes, lots of confirmation there, don't have a pi0 around to check. You'll need an external HD and follow the tutorial listed above: [

I invest money every month. I’ve been in the market for two major crashes, around 20 years.
Those days sucked but overall I’m winning like Charlie Sheen at a Bolivian strip joint.
BTC could change how lots of things work. But regularly with money you would otherwise spend on, say, strippers. Wait 15 years and get back to me.
In the meantime, make sure you invest in big public companies that do things - and the easy, best way is an index ETF. (Like the S&amp;P)
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:31:11

The first step in doing that is to run a node and configure it properly.
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:20:48
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:30:53
BTC will move very quickly when it does, and it’ll be impossible to time. Or it will go to zero. Either way, buying every week if you believe in the long term potential is the best strategy.
If you don’t, you’ll get lucky or get rekt. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:32:58
I hope it tanks harder. I love BTC and stock market sales because I build long term positions.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:13:41
Doesn’t matter over the long term. If you only care about the short term you’re going to get rekt.

ETH blockchain is substantially larger, so you will need a lot more storage/bandwidth.

Best method. I make use of cheap fee periods to make a couple.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:21:50
The sun can spontaneously explode too. Based on prior evidence, this is very unlikely. BTC isn't going anywhere. 
Mainstream integration could take another 10 or 15 years, but much like ARPANet, TCP/IP didn't go anywhere as layers evolved on top of it, either. 
I am very convinced that BTC will form the enabling layer for blockchain transactions going forward on that timeframe - and continue to acquire as much as possible. With money I can justify laughing about lighting on fire, of course..
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:21:50
Every node adds to the decentralized nature and confirmation of the network. It's another copy of the blockchain. It's also a powerful signal to compare the relative impact of other chains and coins.

Bitcoin is the first new thing to happen to finance in hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Next is how much. We are here.
After that comes the use as currency, mass adoption of things like LN.
Patience. Hodl.

You don't have to use it as your wallet to verify your transactions.

If you have a crystal ball and it works reliably, you should trade stocks and futures and make a lot more money. Timing markets is very difficult to do over the long term, and by very difficult, it means impossible. If you have magic skills, like I said, you're wasting them trading bitcoin.

Most people don't understand the fees. You don't need a mutual fund. Buy a ETF.

It means that Henry needs to provide an incentive anyone willing to hire him to pay him in Bitcoin. 
Then he needs to look for ways to turn his non-transferrable fiat into Bitcoin.
Remember, provided he trusts those involved, Bitcoin can easily be transferred by sharing the private keys to the wallet - as simple as the recovery seed words, over a phone. 
In short, Henry needs a smartphone wallet and a hustle.
Henry can also make bitcoin addresses with dice if he doesn't trust or doesn't have access to computers, but obviously transfers require some sort of access to the blockchain.

Do not enter your passphrase anywhere in a web browser!
If you need to recover read how to do it securely offline.
You can smash your ledger with a hammer and recover everything provided you have your backup words. 
If you don’t have your backup words, what the f—k is wrong with you, transfer your funds to a wallet where you have the backup keywords written down.

Satoshi was brilliant.
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:08:00
I personally binned a few hundred BTC back in the day, and the bunch I lost on the first Gox hack never resurfaced AFAIK.
Buy and Hodl. I don’t plan on ever selling for fiat.. because when bitcoin does take its place, I won’t have to sell. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:39:08
..and if you don’t think so, you’re who they make a profit from.

Satoshi had a strange confidence from day one, a contagious confidence.
Makes me wonder about the crazier theories sometimes.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:17:20
You can’t solve a geometric problem with a linear scale.
Block size will increase, but doing so with the intent to mitigate exponential use is not going to work. It might kick the can down the road a few months, but eventually you’ll have to deal with the nature of the problem. Satoshi knew this, and also knew that scaling would come from other, off chain technologies.
@_date: 2019-11-29 01:19:31
Any measure is temporary as the number of independent wallets holding bitcoin grow. Eventually the whales deplete their hoardes for fiat.

When you're the only game in town, does it matter?
I have 10x the available capital inside registered accounts I do outside, and gains remain tax free until removed in an RRSP.
Holding BTC in a TFSA? ... now we're cooking with gas.

Happy to hold for another decade. You should be too. It’s a hedge against some really bad shit.

I actually do hope BTC tanks back to $1k so 21 BTC is doable. Sadly I doubt I’ll see that ever again.

Satoshi’s code is brilliant.
Read it sometime. It’s impressive.
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:08:21
I think he’s dead, but he was probably extorted and/or whacked for the money.
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:16:22
Most of the hodling is retail investors.
The larger whales will sell off over time and the coin gets distributed. It is the way of the Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-03-30 16:38:02
Why would you sell?
Bitcoin mooning means fiat gets rekt. That’s how this happens.
Who wants fiat?
The problem will be people trying to get BTC, not people selling. That will drive the price higher. Rapidly.

BAT is silly when you could just be paid in Satoshis directly with LN.
LN may disrupt online advertising completely, as you can just pay content creators directly. This has implications for Google, et al.

Futures don't affect those who take delivery for use or hodling.
The futures market is part of the process of distributing the coins and the broader knowledge of BTC.
Don't worry about it. In the 5-10 year game none of this matters at all.

Gold doesn't pay compounding dividends. Compounding dividends have made me a lot more money than anything else.
Bitcoin replaced gold for me, YMMV. But it's a terrible investment compared with a compounding return over the long term, and if you don't get why, you're not going to be convinced here.
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:23:28
You don’t pay taxes when you rent, and you don’t have to fix anything. Most of time you can rent a decent place for less than homeowners pay in taxes. 
The return you will get from renting frugally and investing dwarfs real estate, which historically does about even with inflation. Houses do not pay compounding dividends.
But yeah, saddle up that debt..

I'm like most people mid-life and in the stock market because there isn't much alternative. That's not to say the markets haven't been good to me.. but these are uncertain times.

Take your ledger generated seed.
Buy a pi, keyboard and monitor and a SD card.
Set up the pi and do not connect it to a network. Download GPG files to USB.
Plug USB into pi.
Verify GPG hash.
Install GPG. 
GPG plaintext encrypt your seed list. Record pass phrase.
Copy encrypted file back to your USB.
Put encrypted seed in cloud; use a non obvious name.
Store pass phrase separately. Preferably stamped into metal. Or leave with lawyer. 
DO NOT USE A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FOR UNENCRYPTED SEEDS.
Edit: this may be obvious, but burn the SD card and USB when you’re done. Or burn it all. To be sure.

No altcoins have even a fraction of BTC volume.
They can claim whatever they want. ETH has a massive blockchain that is almost unsyncable now.
Higher layer solutions are the right answer, and they work. Lightning already does many more transactions than most alts.
Nothing stopping you from backing an altcoin with BTC either.

The address that's pasted into the wallet is probably not easily compromised, but it's certainly possible the malware could intercept the lower layers. That said, this is more difficult to do, particularly if the wallet is well designed.
This is just more rationale for avoiding desktop wallets. It's too big a threat envelope.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:29:09

I’ve actually tried to build dApps. Ethereum’s dirty secret is that it’s very, very difficult to do this, and if they take off, you’re crippled by the size of the chain very quickly. ETH can’t even reliably sync full nodes - don’t take my word for it, please, try it!
Monero has similar issues with syncing.. but seems to ultimately resolve itself.
Bitcoin’s smart contact functionality is more limited but extensible and more importantly usable.
Bitcoin is the protocol for blockchain. Great stuff will be built on top of it. But it’s early days.

Buy what you can afford to light on fire and Hodl. 
If you’re a short term trader, you’re going to get rekt eventually. Just Hodl. You do not want to miss out when it moves for real.

The value of crypto is not in large sums, there's lots of mechanisms for sending and storing large sums.
The value of crypto is in an ability to send very small sums of money long distances. There is no mechanism currently for this and represents a massive opportunity.

Bitcoin is going to appreciate substantially.
It may even disrupt the USD.
The variable is when. Nobody knows. Not the Fed, not Ver, not even Satoshi. Anyone who claims to know timelines is lying. It’s too early.
That’s the risk. DCA a position and maybe set backstops to limit risk. Understand even backstops require liquidity.

It is very unlikely you will lose everything at this stage. Roller coaster rides are guaranteed. It is more a question of when, not if, Bitcoin appreciates now. DCA lets you buy more when it goes down, and is a safe way to build a position where there is great time uncertainty.
By investing money you'd blow on booze, coke, and hookers anyway, you're not really losing anything. My DCA has grown to a nontrivial stack, but it doesn't bother me when it drops.

Setting up multisig is a pain though, and you can fuck it up. There are few people who will explain how to set it up, and even if you could hire someone, that would defeat the purpose.

There are ETF index funds. They're liquid, low fee, and easy. Mutual funds are for suckers. 
Houses over history keep up with inflation but little more. Few homeowners are honest about operating costs. Between taxes, maintenance, interest, and insurance, most people are far better off renting. Buying a house for an inflated value in many markets now is almost criminally stupid.
Houses do not compound their returns. Compounding interest/returns will set you free. It takes a long time to get that ball rolling, but when it does, oh my..
There are exceptions. I live in a part of the world with great internet and cheap-ass real estate. I paid $50,500 for my first house in 2005 with fiber internet. That was cheaper than renting. 
Homes are not investments. You need to live somewhere, but make sure you have enough to actually invest. There are of course always exceptions.. but odds are you're not one.
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:36:46

Fiat and Bitcoin work on trust. When trust vanishes, so does their value.
The extremely limited supply of Bitcoin and unlimited supply of Fiat and other cryptos is not a stable situation and is inherently unpredictable. Somewhere in the middle may every well be the Moon, but as I said before, when that happens, it won't be that Bitcoin is suddenly worth riches in Fiat. It is that dollars will be majorly devalued relative to BTC.

This depends on how old you are and what your income and risk profile is.
Bitcoin is looking more and more like when, not if, and I’ve allocated most of my discretionary income for this year to buying as much of it as I can while it’s below ATH.
The penalty if it tanks is I work another year. The payoff is I work 5, maybe 8 years less. Bonus I get a great hedge against the carnage that is my stock portfolio right now.

Bitcoin recovering from the collapse of $10k has made the "astronomical" scenario much more likely.

TA will work in a decade or two.
The market is growing unpredictably, people will sell off, coins will distribute, once it’s matured then TA will work.
Right now, it might work sometimes, when the market is functioning normally. Then something happens, people dump, people do huge buys, and it doesn’t behave normally anymore - then you get rekt.
Trading bitcoin is stupid. It’s gambling. Build a position and hold. If you fancy trading, trade stocks! I do, and a lot of those profits end up in the coin.

Gambling is fine, if you can accept you’re gambling and understand your risk exposure.
That doesn’t sound like your average investor, though.
@_date: 2019-02-25 02:13:53
DCA in to lower your average cost if you still believe BTC will win. Wait. 
Otherwise, you’re literally gambling. Nobody knows. If you have a couple hundred BTC you can probably throw some exchanges around;
Lots of techniques that are illegal with regulated securities are legal (depending where you are) with Bitcoin.
If you’re speculating.. you’re going to get rekt.

Short answer: no.
Longer answer: If this happened, there would be way worse problems than bitcoin’s security. The worst case scenario is that a fork to new algorithms is required; this is certainly doable, and in that apocalyptic scenario even likely. This is a remote possibility; not worth worrying about.

I knew about BTC sub $1.
I got fucked on Gox and walked away for awhile.
Came to my senses in 2016 when it just wouldn’t fuxking go away. Trust me, it would have been sweet if it all blew up. But it wouldn’t and it wouldn’t get out of my head.
I burned HUNDREDS of coins. In the early days if you wanted some, you could mine a block of 50 solo in a few hours.
I can laugh about it, just like I laugh at people losing their shit when it drops 50%.
But I’ve learned Bitcoin is going nowhere. It is something new. And it is unstoppable.
@_date: 2019-06-08 18:08:47
Also once you enter the address, hit tab or something, it might not be realizing you put an address in.
@_date: 2019-02-24 05:07:27

When do you think TCP/IP was invented?
Do you understand network effect?
Do you think Bitcoin was first?
Bitcoin is an enabiling protocol for a communication stack based on a blockchain. LN is another layer on that, and applications will form higher layers still. 
Bitcoin won because it got the network effect scaling first. The nature of the beast is winner takes all, and looking at history, it’s the first to gain exponential growth and multiple vendors that wins.
Viewing Bitcoin as a base protocol and not an end in itself is part of the key in understanding this.

What will make BTC moon won’t be sending $100. It’s that you can send $0.001 without a middleman and without a central party via LN. That can replace ads, which everyone fucking hates.

Don't care. I have full faith in the governments to drive the fiat economy into the ground. 
It's already happened, but the rubes haven't woken up yet. The real estate bubble is the rich getting rid of fiat.
Stack. The real price moves will happen very quickly and will correspond to a debt crisis. By definition, the price will move because demand outstripping supply, and you won't be able to buy when that happens.
Trade stocks. Hodl Bitcoin.

USE A HARDWARE WALLET.
I have been using computers since they had kilobytes of ram, and I don’t trust myself to be able to manage a hot wallet safely with any volume of crypto on it.
For the love of Satoshis, a Nano S is super cheap, and very, very secure. 
Online wallets, exchanges.. you’ll be robbed.
I learned on Gox with the loss of a present day fortune that would make your eyes bleed. QCX people had to learn, and others will too.
Use a hardware wallet!

Use Bitcoin as a long terms savings account then.

Newbies are far more likely to fuck up a wallet generation than using a proper hardware wallet. The computer you’re generating it on has a much much higher chance of compromise than a Ledger.

You'd be nuts not to have some exposure. Nothing is guaranteed, but nothing like Bitcoin has ever existed before. 
Don't invest money you can't laugh about losing, and if you're not here like me enjoying the tears of the rekt and shopping for discounts, you're buying Bitcoin with money you shouldn't be using for crypto.

Metals get confiscated and you can’t easilyfractionally divide them or send them. Bitcoin solves this.
Is it speculative? Fuck yes. There are no other assets that offer its advantages, and as such, 5% of my investment portfolio is BTC and the only crypto I own. Enough so I can benefit, as I see a lot of parallels to other early technologies - I’ve been through this before.
If you believe in the capabilities, there’s lots of reasons to own some. If you don’t, why are you here? If you’re upset over the price - well, you invested too much, didn’t diversify, or spent money you shouldn’t have.
BTC is a good hedge against major chaos, and it’s a valid reason to own it. A speculative hedge, absolutely - but one I’ll be happy to own when the musical chairs stops on US debt.

@_date: 2018-11-23 18:30:20
People are silly.
BTC is primarily a hedge against a fiat collapse or debt crisis. If either or both of those happen, you will be very happy to have some % of your net worth in BTC.
In the meantime, it’s the only distributed, censorproof,  scarce, and incredibly well backed means to transfer wealth. That has extreme utility, and buying coffee has nothing to do with it.
Looking forward, LN offers a way to pay for content directly, no middlemen, no ads.
These are all fundamental reasons to own Bitcoin. They’re also why I hope it does go down more and shake out people who don’t get it.
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:01:03
No modern trading economy has ever experienced a famine. Famines are political problems.
Currency collapses are mitigated by alternative means. If it's all out collapse, you're trading in shotgun shells, not BTC. BTC isn't relevant to those situations, but neither is fiat, or gold. Those situations become about power. Quickly.

You're right, on the short term.
Long term what is important is that Bitcoin be perceived as something that has value, and people will trade work and time to accumulate. The speculating and FOMO are all part of that cycle. 
I bet on a fight last night (won, too). The bet was placed on another continent where such things are legal via BTC and paid out same way. This would be impossible to do any other way, and worked because BTC has value.

Bank accounts aren’t financial instruments. Money stored in a bank isn’t “yours”, and there are rules about how and who you can send it to, including disclosures for international transfers.
Bitcoin keys are more like a financial instrument - they’re the manifestation of the asset, same as walking with the gold.
The difference is, for the first time, it is possible to store that information mentally. The transfer is not censorsble. This is novel in the history of money.
That’s the fundamental difference you are missing. If you’ve ever tried to buy property or a car cross border, you understand this pain.

Money stored in a bank ceases to be “your” money when deposited. In the $600m example, not only would they not be able to do it instantly, but you’d be filing one hell of a lot of paperwork on what you intended to do with it.

3.14159265 BTC sounds pretty good to me. :)
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:23:24
It has more to do with who uses these and the premium they’re willing to pay. Bitcoin can’t be confiscated. QED.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:12:40
It isn’t .003 yet. Keep stacking.

Shitcoins. There are no credible altcoins. Watch for more coins being built on top of BTC.

Still buyin.. buy on the way up, buy on the way down..
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:16:49
..some of us have been buying regularly for a very, very, very long time.
If it goes below $1000, I have funds set aside for that.. but I suspect I'm not alone, and I doubt that's likely. (I hope so though!)
The real end game for BTC is 5, 7, 10 years out. If you're not buying for then, you're better off swing trading in the market. 
Long positions FTW. But we'll have to check in 5 years, hrmm?
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:06:45
You’ll feel better if you attempt a recovery with another wallet offline. Just.. wipe the computer you used after. Or better yet, use a pi and burn the SD.

Every Satoshi that gets held reduces whale influences.
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:24:29
They can only lend out to a maximum of their held reserve. There's no fractional reserve, and thus, no opportunity to create bitcoin from thin air. Oh the horror!
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:05:01
That's not important, but suffice to say crypto has few friends with bankers.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:19:38
This is comically wrong. BTC makes a lot of international transactions very easy that would be difficult or impossible otherwise.. and they're most certainly not happening on exchanges.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:45:20
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:02:11
Bitcoin is being adopted at a tremendous rate as a store of value and a hedge against inflating fiat.
That’s step one, and it’s enough to boost the value of bitcoin 10x from where we are now.
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:26:12
Coinbase can take a long time to send.

Don’t mix bitcoin proceeds with your bank account.
Better yet, don’t sell any bitcoin! When the time is right, you don’t have to.
If you want to broker.. do it in cash or minted gold coins with reasonable security measures.

If Bitcoin moons, fiat simultaneously tanks. This is missed by a lot of people.

Difficulty would adjust and we would have equilibrium with power rate again after a short while, but with even more hash power securing the network.

Anyone who likes to bet knows the utility of BTC well.
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:19:51
Satoshi could be an AI from the future. The code is pretty damn good.

That'd be quite the hardware wallet functionality.. wouldn't it. Satellite BTC transfer.
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:13:58
You need to consider the scale of 100 exahash.
Bitcoin is something very different, that has never existed before. 
Buy, hodl. Every Satoshi you hold is a vote against the status quo.

The flip side of BTC mooning is fiat tanking.
@_date: 2019-09-04 02:31:20
I’ve bought consistently for the last three years, every 2-3 weeks. I disagree completely. This is a great strategy to stack sats.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:03:41
Wait 12 months and you'll have your answer.
I work in finance. No financial institution will ever allow a third party to put their fingers on transaction fees. You're in fantasy land if you think otherwise.
Crypto is rat poison to these folks. They're not embracing their undoing.

@_date: 2019-09-07 22:49:26
Don’t trade BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:48:54
I'll allocate my 5&amp; high risk registered savings to BTC if there's a proper ETF to do so. I suspect I'm not alone.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:11:25
They're all shitcoins except BTC. XMR has some redeeming graces but hard privacy will find it's way to BTC.
I am a BTC maximalist. I see little value in any other projects that wouldn't be better served by a higher layer on top of the bitcoin blockchain. Other than to make their founders rich, of course, which they do very well.
I am very nervous about ANY fiat holdings at the moment, USD included. I keep very little cash at all around.
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:14:20
All you had to do was buy $100 weekly.
Bitcoin is a harsh mistress. Buy, Hodl, Win.

The best time to buy bitcoin was ~ 10 years ago.

Good to know. I will continue to watch..
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:29:24
Timing markets is stupid. Build a long position with money you can lose, buy every week. Short term positions are dumb, you’re basically gambling, and the odds of not holding when a major move happens are large. 
BTC is going McAfee or to zero. When is the million dollar question.

It’s an interesting side effect for taking an early risk against the collapse of fiat.

@_date: 2018-04-06 23:11:31
Definitely not new. But BTC's value hasn't even hinted at if it's adopted. If it's not adapted, it'll be a rocky road to zero. If it is adopted - still, admittedly, a big if - it will make the current ATH look like a daily fluctuation.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:33:42
This is part of bitcoin being spread. But and hold it. There is a finite amount to distribute.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:02:12
I hope it goes much lower so I can acquire more. Utility of bitcoin going forward is awesome. I’d happily pay a few Satoshis per view to never see ads again. I bet I’m not alone.

It’s dangerous because Coinbase can decide they don’t like you anymore, and hold your coins. Or the US government could decide bitcoin is a real threat and order them to halt trading.

Rules are different wherever you live.
The problem is they claim they can't verify where the funds came from.
If you don't sell, this argument is not applicable - your money comes from your job, whatever.
If you transfer huge sums in, of course they're going to ask where it came from. That's the law.

@_date: 2019-05-07 19:00:35
Less than you think.
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:42:42
The problem is the machine isn’t really airgapped. The code came from someplace, and the RNG may be compromised or have a bug. This has happened before! 
If your wallet lacks entropy, it’s a potential target. 
For $100, who cares.

People put too much stock in historical patterns. Bitcoin is something completely new and it’s very, very early days still.

The security of the random number depends on the wallet and/or the underlying OS.
This is one reason to prefer a hardware wallet; the random generations have been audited.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:59:09
Bitcoin could moon or go to zero. There is very little long term middle case.
10% of your capital is about as high as is sane, imo. 
I took another tact which has been to buy weekly for the last few years with discretionary income; it doesn’t hurt when it goes down and it doesn’t affect my other investments that way.
If you’re not laughing at the price drops and people freaking out, you’re in too deep. I know people in too deep. You don’t want to end up $100k underwater. Could be a long wait.

XRP is a centralized joke.
MySpace didn’t have 50+ Exahash validating it.
The bitcoin protocol and the distributed ledger drive the long term value and those are network effect numbers. 
BTC is king. Hodl.

Use a ledger to generate the wallet and verify it works.

You've missed one important point.
You can commit your funds, but YOU don't have to. Someone else can and offer the service.
If you want to run your own nodes, go right ahead. No third party needed. 
This provides profit motive for people to make it easier.
LN has other techniques to swap and provide liquidity.  But it works right now, I'm using it, and other people are too. 
BlueWallet is one great (custodial) service that.. "just works".

This is a terrible idea.
Sell useless shit you don’t need, work extra shifts, drunk less, but don’t mortgage your house or blow your retirement stack that should be in good dividend paying companies.
You need to be able to laugh if it hits $500. Because there will be so many tears if that happened..
If bitcoin moons, 1BTC is all you will ever need. Maybe less.

Bitcoin can inflate to a crazy value if nobody sells and not much will change. That’s missed in most analysis. Then it contributes to global wealth totals. Everyone assumes people would just unload coins, but I actually think the dead opposite is true. If BTC hits $100k I am -never- selling.

BTC is uncharted territory. Billions of people don’t have bank accounts. There are only 31,000,000 wallets on chain. Governments continue to grow financial control; fear of civil forfeiture is a real use case and the reason for BTC ATMs in the land of the free.

Gold is a shit investment, it’s hard to transport and can easily be stolen or seized. 
It’s a good hedge against the end of the world. So is silver, and every few years I buy a dozen boxes of shotgun shells.
It’s fun to play with. You can form a psychological attachment to it. Much like Satoshis.
Bitcoin however can be sent anywhere, anytime, and can exist in my head, and cannot be seized or impounded. That is tremendous utility.

Bitcoin could hit $100k without much effect. It depends how much volume is exchanging hands at that price.
Bitcoin may hit $1m or more but it will do so in an environment where confidence in fiat has collapsed.

It’s probable snatching a pile up early might change the likelihood of adoption.
Part of the reason it’s worth something is nobody took it seriously early on and just played with it. I mined several CPU blocks of 50 early on just to see how it worked, those were all burned, it was easy to get more, no big deal. It was an experiment.
A very important experiment.

Gen X guy here. I have a pile of physical metal, but haven’t bought any in a decade. It’s a terrible investment. I mainly like playing with it. Now I play with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:05:05
It works until it doesn’t..
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:42:01
US dollar dropping 20%.
Market crash.
LN being adopted for content payment.
Please sell and crash the price harder.. I need more.
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:28:17
Zero day exploits are a type of magic..
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:36:31
Bitcoin is being used as a place to store wealth. Unlike shitcoins, it’s actually scarce and well protected.
Go home, no-coiner. Pick up some BCH on your way out.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:40:33
Will sure give you some pause if it does, though?
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:24:06
Or we’re very, very lucky.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:58:40
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:48:11
Buy every week or two weeks and it doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:04:50
Hear you brother. Hodl.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:18:30
Not your keys.. not your coins.
I learned the hard way too.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:56:39
I’d rather spend the money on Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-05-30 01:58:42
I’ll have some made and maybe we can vote on favourites.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:24:46
Bitcoin is probably more resilient than people suspect.
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:16:48
Every time I bet on a fight with BTC it makes me giddy. More so when I win.
Try that with a credit card.
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:06:59
Why doesn't Veriblocks use BCash? ;)
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:41:03
Look at relative position in cycle not absolute months.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:56:26
@_date: 2018-12-10 04:31:42
No matter where you get your ledger, follow their instructions to verify the firmware and the hardware. I sourced mine off Amazon.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:03:40
BTC ATMs are heavily used by people wanting to transfer cash without fear of civil forfeiture. I was wondering why so many of them are around airports; that’s why.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:36:00
That’s because they’ve already started the blather about ETH 2.0 because - surprise - ETH is an unusable clusterfuck. Try syncing a node.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:23:59
Can’t order Bitcoin to stop shit.
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:00:01
Unlikely. :(
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:10:17
I cheer.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:51:19
I am anyway..
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:42:49
How is 0.004 worth trading?
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:51:30
Yup. I looked back and it was actually a comment from Hal Finney, but I'll say that's almost as good as Satoshi. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:39:54
All bets are off on the next run. It could hit $50k or it could hit $1m. All I am pretty sure of is it’ll run very very fast and it will be difficult to buy or sell, as exchanges will have all sorts of problems and governments may restrict fiat moves.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:24:09
Not in today’s dollars.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:00:17
That was Satoshi’s ratio. 1 Satoshi, $0.01 USD.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:19:58
I've done quite well buying when there's blood in the streets. Companies are easy, they make things, they publish balance sheets, and those fundamentals don't change. Only impatient people, or people who invested money that they shouldn't have, panic when the market drops. Markets drop. They also go back up, and dividends keep on flowing.
For example, Ford (F) has a 52 week low of $7.41. I filled my bags around $8, and it's now around $10.40. It's dividend at $8 was close to 9%. There's no survivor bias there. I'll exit at $11 and collect my gain, or I'll just sit and enjoy that dividend for a decade.
Crypto is different, it's new, it has nothing to compare it to, and the upside for Bitcoin is literally the moon if it becomes a major reserve currency. It's silly to sell without understanding the market, and the market is so new, and has so many entrants coming in, and so many external factors, the smart move is to build a position and sit on it.
You do you though.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:07:30
BTC is departing steady state territory. Embrace the madness.
@_date: 2019-05-24 05:30:02
Secondary, for higher layers.
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:02:42
I make tons of Satoshis off alts via nicehash :)
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:32:44
Been buying weekly for years. Highly recommend. 
Spend money you don’t care about.. it’s funny watching people freak out while you acquire on sale.
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:51:50
Then sell and keep it low so I can stack more :)
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:24:25
Bought the drop this morning.  Will buy again soon! 
DCA is less fun when it brings your average price up :(
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:24:05
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:27:22
Buy a ledger from Amazon. By far the most newbie friendly.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:50:16
With bitcoin, you control the payments. The bank doesn’t stop a transaction, they can’t. No stupid subscription bullshit. No frozen accounts. 
Bitcoin will moon on micropayments .. not storing value.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:10:46
You don’t need to bet the farm.
1-2 BTC is all your ever need in most scenarios.
Hodl. Patience.
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:02:32
Even Google can’t touch the unfarhomable hash power of the BTC blockchain. That’s what gives bitcoin the power. Don’t worry until that changes.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:39:49
I’d rather keep the satoshis. Age tempers the appeal of the flesh.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:48:41
And now Bitcoin lets you opt out.
Can’t wait for my weekly buy.
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:01:43
There is no difference properly implemented.
Don’t use a sketchy wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:42:21
I sold several hundred BTC at $10 using that logic.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:53:31
Got involved way back. Specifically to learn the tech. 
Lost coins, lost interest.
Came back, realized the tech was working. Started to acquire. Continue to acquire.
Unlike most I don’t buy with money I need, and I’m super happy to see the price drop, as I can acquire more, on a schedule, all the way down. I can’t imagine I’d ever see $100 BTC again, but oh - imagine the day!
So long as King BTC has the hashrate, it will remain king. If the hashrate dropped 95% or something crazy - that would be heartbreaking, much worse than short term fluctuations.
Nothing like Bitcoin has existed in human history. I haven’t been this excited since I used an internet connected VAX, or the first time I downloaded PGP back in the day.
If you’re not laughing at the panic, you’re in too deep. HODL.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:22:42
That’s a pretty good analysis.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:28:23
Don’t want to talk about it. Argh.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:07:49
Throwing truly random dice is not trivial. Nor is proving it.
If you have a sizeable amount of BTC, I'd pick the audited RNG.
@_date: 2019-05-21 04:58:51
The longer this takes the better for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:00:27
Ever get pulled over and your fiat seized?
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:29:24
I don’t need to sell. If you need to sell at any price, you have WAY to much invested in BTC.
I’ll ride it down to zero,  buying the whole way. And laughing at people who got rekt. Bitcoin is speculative and insanely risky. There is no reference. It is something very rare in the financial world. Something NEW. This means opportunity.. but also crazy risk.
If Bitcoin takes off, it’s valuation in dollars will be meaningless as it will upend the financial system.
Put your coke and whores money in and wait. I started from zero in late 2016 after losing.. a substantial amount in Gox.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:08:19
Funny, I think the same thing about banks.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:11:52
I hope it does but I think we’ve seen the last of $4k coin.
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:32:26
ETH’s LN doesn’t exist. Nor does PoS. Not in any useable fashion. King BTC leads again.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:45:11
Are you insane? Don’t store coins on the exchanges.
Buy a nano S. They’re cheap.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:40:43
No. It does come from mines, though.. ;)
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:20:15
There is no stopping bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:44:31
I have a friend like this; if he’s betting on something, bet on the other fighter. 
It’s like a superpower.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:47:01
There is never a bad time to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:41:07
BCH is pumping. Nobody wants that shitcoin, so brace for retractment.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:33:40
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:34:04
Nano S. That or Treznor are the only serious choices I’d recommend for large balances. For a few hundred bucks it probably doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:25:02
Lost the keys, sorry..
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:43:52
mYen didn’t catch on either.
Satoshis FTW.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:34:34
They should make a wallet with a BAC lockout. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:15:16
I buy every week or two regardless of price.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:08:59
Future profits in that case. If Amazon missed a few quarters it would be $10 in a hurry.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:31:33
I cleaned out the garage and picked up a bonus 0.3 BTC. Stack those Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:23:32
Bitcoin will fuck shut up good.
Enough folks sell fiat the BTC and shit gets ugly.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:26:21
One could argue that is the natural end value of all fiat.. zero.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:53:47
We’re probably past that point now.
It’s not like the network stops with a 51% attack, either; it would be obvious what was happening and mitigations could be taken.
Don’t worry. Hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:26:15
Real estate is taxed. Good luck taxing my Satoshis.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:52:21
I’ll mortgage my house at $1k. Oh, to get that opportunity again.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:06:32
They can’t succeed.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:13:15
Use a ledger or other hardware wallet if it’s more than a few million Satoshis.
It is near impossible for a professional to securely manage generating wallets. Don’t.
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:51:01
Sure, let me summarize:
Stupid people get fucked.
Poor people get fucked.
Play long term trends and fundamentals not FOMO.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:41:01
It would add huge value to the community and bolster your folllowing greatly.
We need more open source LN apps.
Please consider this. Make sure to remember a LN tip jar.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:58:49
Supply and demand.
These days are so early ..
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:38:50
If you don't have a decent regular income fix that first.
Invest in yourself first, do everything you can to maximize your earning potential, then save. Not before.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:16:21
Banks don’t like BTC much either.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:44:07
This is hilariously stupid. Short Facebook.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:25:52
Nobody cares
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:54:18
No bank will ever let a third party profit off their stacks. Bankers have been milking middlemen for thousands of years. They don’t get milked.
XRP is trash. It is however a good indicator; when it halves in value BTC is headed for the moon.
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:15:13
You can be anonymous on the public ledger.
Most lightning transactions will never appear anywhere.
Bitcoin arrives just in time, it seems..
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:05:27
Too risky, just buy and Hodl.
When the moon happens it’ll be the biggest Bart ever. And you won’t get to be in the opening credits.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:31:49
Hodl long enough and just walk away.
If BTC moons, that's going to be the best option for most of the people here anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:16:28
It works until it doesn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:56:57
Buying all the way down. Please panic sell. 
If you’re not laughing you have too much money in the game.
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:44:12
They’re happy they have an opportunity to keep buying cheap. :)
@_date: 2019-05-06 12:16:07
Stocks and real estate are fine too.
Nobody intelligent holds vast quantities of fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:09:34
Don’t care about daily transactions. Existing solutions are fine for that for most things.
Buying things internationally? Betting on fights? Protecting my wealth from inflation rape? Oh yeah. That’s the ticket.
Everything else is just gravy.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:25:30
There is no evidence this is true. Bitcoin could hit multiples of $100k just displacing gold.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:01:51
I would be terribly reluctant to sell an asset that scarce and in that much demand.
I don’t plan on selling any; I plan on using it directly in that scenario - I suspect I am not alone.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:53:10
Unless the exchanges are doing shady shit.
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:37:37
Trade stocks. Hodl bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:13:28
Ripple is king shitcoin and my indicator of choice.
When it’s rallied we’re taking a break.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:15:39
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:37:54
Spend your coke and whores money on BTC instead.
It’s not a place for your retirement stack. 
I’d get more enjoyment from watching the green dildos than doing shots off a stripper. ROI is better too!
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:49:34
I have as little fiat as possible. Assets FTW.
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:39:31
Excellent plan.
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:16:55
I’d probably take out mortgage debt if BTC dropped below $1000.
Guessing I’m not alone.
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:05:38
Source? No seriously .. I want to make up some interesting stuff, but am wondering about official open graphics. There aren’t any on the lighting labs site.
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:20:33
Haha haha. Alts stagnating and BTC rising is the bullish indicator I’ve been waiting for.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:30:55
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You got some terrible legal advice if you agreed to those terms.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:55:38
Neither is cash fiat.
