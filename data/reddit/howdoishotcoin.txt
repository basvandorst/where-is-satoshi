I looked into blockchain.info and [answered]( my own question.

So I did this with the bare minimum btc, I am confused on which address in my wallet I should expect the return (if any) on? There was no option to send from specific address in bitcoin-qt. I feel like I am missing something

A lot of unhelpful, negative responses. I was under the impression that satoshidice was more popular due to the provably fair thing. What's not to like?

So I am getting btc back from satoshidice, but its coming to what seems to be a random selection of the addresses, I check blockchain and it seems bitcoin-qt is picking addresses to send from at random? I suppose I don't know enough about it, but it would be nice if all SD transactions would be under a single account.

Not really, I am new to bitcoin and this was something he told me to check out to help get an understanding of bitcoin. I don't plan on playing a ton, I just want to check things out.

So I sent the min ammount a while ago, but I have no response. According to the site "IMPORTANT: Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test with .001 Bitcoins. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible"
Is there anyway to check if satoshidice got my transaction?
