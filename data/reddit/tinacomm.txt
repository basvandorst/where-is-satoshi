It can feel like gambling, but if we think deeply, all the investments are like this, you never know where you can make thousands times more than you started.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:15:49
Sure, you are totally right, media has a great impact on it
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:35:16
I agree, this crypto mania is made up by media but really nothing so unusual, just market fluctuations. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:16:05
remember how much bitcoin grew last year and just wait, guys:)
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:03:31
great, thanks for a very nice opinion, all the analytics understand that but not everyone can express officially this view
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:03:20
it's genious!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:10:05
this are market fluctuations, it's normal, just bitcoiners are worried much about it but actually it's obvious it will rise again
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:31:40
just saw this video somewhere else, it's crazy!
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:04:11
amazing lol:)) but Belarus is the first. They will try first with Belarus, see what comes out and implement the best ideas, strong tsar in action:))
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:17:45
lol!!!!!!!!! Finally meme for a real thing:)
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:52:18
Someone sold a lot of btc..
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:18:33
Wow, a real success story! You are cool, dude!
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:06:43
It's cool! But I'm not so surprised because it's quite expected. I think the growth will not be so fast in the future, it will slow down for sure. But blockchain business will grow up, I believe so. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:21:41
This year changed everything! We live in a new world, guys!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:12:56
looks good lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:33:16
Good words, I agree with you, but soon everything will change because it's a new era of money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:19:24
Thank you for your story, it's very interesting and usefull, so people can see how things were changing over the time and think much  more long-term than they do
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:44:08
kfc is on top :))
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:31:03
Japan is really cool and active in crypto world. I think soon it will be leading in it
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:16:31
totally true!
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:52:30
cute, good beginning! Hodl until it reaches a million:)
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:32:42
Of course! For a long time in a while we didn't have anything made people so obsesed. 
I'm glad to live in this era totally:)
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:47:44
hilarious! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:02:13
oh no! It shouldn't happen nowadays 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:36:18
It's going to happen, just needs some time? thank you for sharing
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:55:29
lol it's my future
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:37:52
it's becoming more and more complicated to obtain so maybe it won't reach 100% in the nearest future
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:47:59
Good PR, kfc:))
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:05:11
Thanks for sharing!
But this year btc will be still the most powerful
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:14:29
loool so sad true
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:56:27
Yes, totally!
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:36:16
wow so cool! I hope there will be more places like this in the world
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:26:39
have such friends :)))
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:18:02
Congrats, you will profit:)
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:47:50
well, guys, he is used to dollars, a lot of dollars and this new currency seems too offbeat for him. Nothing strange, but I actually think he invested in BTC and he is hodler lol :))
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:34:43
BTC is a longterm investment, you'd better hodl, mate
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:17:46
Their experience shows same thing:) they were waiting for years until btc has grown up to what we had in 2017
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:42:24
Oh unexpected. One more country to make crypto legal probably?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:00:51
Well, if we use cryptos only for transfers inbetween wallets and are not planning to accomplish any other operations, then you are right, no bank is needed. But for the financial procedures like making deposits, convertation crypto-fiat-crypto, payments/investments etc. one bank with all such necessary services is quite an important institute.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:44:44
the most famous also:))
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:31:02
It was only for your information, I have nothing to do with this project, just saw it and it's here for the whole picture of the world. Don't judge everyone the same
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:33:38
me too, it's a very bureaucratized country and I can't believe they will be the first in crypto world...
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:03:24
they are talking about it for a long time already. Hope it will happen because when such giants start accepting cryptos, all the others also think they should do the same
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:22:53
Soon it will be quite common :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:46:29
not fair!
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:38:30
lmao why so true :))
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:35:19
talking from technological side - of course, but now it's not always easy to use btc, so for the moment we are more dependant on fiat money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:52:02
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:00:03
They are going to become world's first miners I heard
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:04:53
First that btc will raise and get the maximum :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:49:49
good idea, I think it will start a new fashion:))
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:57:56
Ups and downs unexpectedly :))
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:09:53
lol does it mean all the others have eth?
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:45:29
is there any difference? And is it just a company's initiative?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:01:31
actually experience shows you are right. It's easier to settle things there with just money, in Europe there is no possibility to do this. That's why for example Belarus is the first, not Germany, not US or Russia
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:22:01
Any other options if I want to buy a car but I can do it only with credit? Share if you have real solutions for this
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:45:05
totallly agree:)))
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:57:37
seems that they are in negotiations with countries for creating such a zone. Well, it can be better than a technological park probably
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:46:01
I like the prediction to HODL:)
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:18:40
I can relate to you, your arguments are realistic enough
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:32:21
Sure it will, hodlers know what they do:)
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:58:00
Just an experiment for him
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:30:45
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:05:57
ya, maybe. But nobody knows yet how it will work
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:53:48
Give me a link please
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:27:34
Buy Bitcoin now!
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:03:19
the same answer as above. If you only do transfers, then it's ok, but for now you do all the opearations with fiats, I will give you a btc if you convince me the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:48:54
true. but the question is if companies really benefit from it. I know that a new law will be out in March and still they will need time to make it work
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:37:38
great article, really truthful. People don't understand what is btc and other cryptos as well, they just hear some very general things and form their opinions which are far from reality.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:42:13
they are scared that finances can go out of their control
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:40:25
wow cool story:) the future has begun here:))
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:41:39
is this the first one?
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:36:23
It's a philosophy, but we are living in a real world, where people want to live in good houses, travel and drive good cars. If you and I refuse to live in a consumerism world it doesn't mean everyone will. You are talking about changing the whole system we are living in for centuries, it's kind of utopia mate.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:52:36
I have been there and talked to people, they are not good in foreign languages but explained me that their salary rates are very low and enterpreneurs can't work normally
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:09:43
great news! Hope other cryptos will also be accepted one day
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:39:55
Actually I saw a project FreeZone, check if you want, they will establsih a bank like that.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:00:11
like it :D
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:28:35
Georgia also
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:41:50
Found it for you 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:12:47
yes, typical banks will go to hell. But that will be exactly a new type of a bank. No one will ever control cryptos, I agree that decentralization is the core of it but still you also understand that new financial systems are necessary. Otherwise what will we do when real money will be out of use and we will have to get a credit in bitcoins? We should now think of those prospects.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:49:57
it's not the worst time to invest, consider some predictions from persons who have weight in the industry.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:01:38
it will never go away already, we need to get used to it and prepare to a new world
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:06:41
yes, but stable BTC price is not bad also (of course at 11-12000)
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:00:25
Really great news for S Korea
