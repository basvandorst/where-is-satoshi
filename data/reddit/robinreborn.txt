How much of a panic would it cause if he sold 10 BTC?  If it did cause a panic, he could buy BTC and sell them later for a profit.

PPV might be more appealing for some customers who don't watch that much TV.  Right now Netflix has an option for heavy watchers (where they'll send you DVDs), a cheaper option for moderate watchers (streaming only).  They don't have an option for people that watch video very occasionally, like once a month.

Wait, why can't he break up a block of 50?

By deleting his coins he destroys all the profit he's made for his work, it would be very stupid.
Obviously selling all his coins as once would be stupid as well, but there's nothing saying he has to sell them all at once.  He could sell them off slowly.

Why?  There are already lots of people mining and they aren't centralized.  There are already millions of bitcoins in existence which are also not centralized.

Which begs the question of when mining ends and its necessary to make money from transaction fees (no new capital flowing in, miners have some control over capital flow), will there be a fixed exchange rate?  
I don't think Bitcoin will have a fixed exchange rate, but I think it will become less volatile.

I could give you a story but since I've been downvoted so heavily I don't think it's worth it.
edit: OK, so I might as well...
We don't know anything about Bitcoin's creator, there's no evidence he's a real person.  The inventor of Bitcoin clearly had a large amount of knowledge of Cryptography and networking, and the NSA tries to have a monopoly on that sort of stuff.

There's nothing to say that Krugman is always wrong, but what reason do we have to believe he is right about Bitcoin?  He makes bold predictions, some are right and others are wrong .

This is interesting but there are some things that I think people should keep in mind:
China didn't set a firm date for this goal.
Achieving this goal will be difficult for China.
Even if they do achieve this goal, the dollar will still have some level of strength because of history and because the Chinese will have to do a lot to gain people's confidence.
Anyways, this is good for Bitcoin because it creates volatility and the more volatile the foreign exchange market is, the more people will value Bitcoins.

But they are being used as a currency, there are businesses that let you pay using bitcoins.

OK, but why should we believe his predictions are right?  Why is he any better than chance?

What would happen if nobody mined? (I know this isn't economically realistic.)
Do additional miners provide any services or do they just cause more electricity and GPU cycles to be wasted?

It's a good question, and I can only speculate on answers.
Most people 'investing' in bitcoins are doing it on a whim... maybe they heard a story about some early adopter who made lots of money and think they can make as much money.  I don't know anybody (besides myself) that has theories about what causes bitcoin to rise or fall.

Nitpicking... but the goldfish have bad memories thing is an urban legend:

Who said that the internet meant the end of the business cycle?  And what does this have to do with the fax being as important as the internet?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:14:16
They only function as an investment if they are also being used as a currency.  
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:29:36
What does that have to do with the internet?
And how does it justify Krugman's quote?

This thread has made me feel better that I didn't buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:38:44
Because they're aware that implementing bitcoin is possible for civillians to do, but when they do it first then they can snoop through even more financial transactions (which consumers believe are private).

The current market capitalization is 1.3 billion, in theory that means that all the bitcoin users together have made 1.3 billion.  Since there aren't that many bitcoin users, and some users are much more active than others it's pretty clear that many people have made lots of money.
