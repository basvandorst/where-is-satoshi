Just buy bitcoin? You need an exchange, which is cheaper and esaier than coinbase and circle.
Choose your exchange from  
I recommend you BTC-e and LakeBTC, BTC-e is more deposits &amp; withdrawals way, but the fee is high; LakeBTC is more liquidity and easy, but the deposits &amp; withdrawal way limited Bank wire, Egopay and Ripple.

BPI of coindesk is more authoritative than coinbase/bitpay since the data sources from more major exchanges, and coindesk's price is more stable.

buy bitcoin via bitpay? how much do you cost?
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:21:13
you are careful! 
this is the key detail, i think many people like me didn't notice it at that time, the quarterly audits of reserves is never come!
I think that if they can't do that better to never mention it, but bitstamp promised that. did they think this is a news headline to attract attention?
as for *how much money they have in cold storage now?* we can estimate bitstamp's profit in 2014 according to [Bitstamp 2013 annual statements](
2013 is $834,000, even if bitstamp double profits in 2014, it's only $1,668,000; triple is $2,502,000. but the loss is 18,000 BTC, even by current price $257, it's $4,950,000! 
I want to know how they make up for this losses. And if bitstamp site were returned tomorrow, would you willing to trading on there?
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:56:00
I can't foresee that anyone would to copy me, I just want to ask which alternatives exchange would you trading? the site still not works for now
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:51:00
it's not a good way for only waiting passively. 
anyone is in Europe? please look into the company what was happened actually? did bitstamp go bankrupt? if not, when did you start again? 
I would donate the man 0.03btc, on behalf of me or us, if you have any questions can't find the answer online, please write this.
were bitstamp mtgox2? just wait and see

That is 150,000 subscription, not the real users.
Like me, I don't subscribe but I read it everyday. In contrast, anyone would never read even he subscribed it.
And this is a ture story.
