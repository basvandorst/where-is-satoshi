But it is a completely unnecessary cost, look at this site
Transactions are clearing at 400 sat/B within the next block and dropping.  If these services actually built competent wallets that can measure what fees have been confirmed in the last few blocks then fees would go down (NOT to mention all the services that STILL haven't upgraded to SegWit)

Wait for the difficulty change for B Cash tomorrow (

Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjusts in a few hours, so that is when miner's should point there hash power back at BTC since it will be more profitable after the difficulty adjustment

The mining difficulty should not be gamed like that.  That is one big reason by B Cash is a bullshit crypto
