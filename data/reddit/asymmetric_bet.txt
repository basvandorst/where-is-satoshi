Very few people know this.  When you put your money in the bank, you become a creditor of the bank, that money legally belongs to the bank and they can do as they please with the money that you "loaned" them.  We think we've "deposited" "our" money, the law says we've "loaned" money and it's now theirs.  And they have a debt to you.  
This is why people in Cyprus were wiped out, and it was totally legal.

To me a bubble (in btc) is at least a tripling of the price in a space of a few weeks. 
I think the next bubble will take 6 months to form.  Right now too many people have got 100x return on their gains (buying at $6 in 2012), and they must be offloading some.  
Note that $5 was already 100x gains for people who bought for 5 cents at the early gox days.  I think that 2012's low volatility (that is, until the reward halving) came from people offloading and taking those profits out.
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:45:21

yeah, right.  All this shit about doge ends up being free advertisement for litecoin.  It is totally transparent and it smacks of a desperate attempt.   
The very idea that there will be only one crypto is foolish.  If history is any guide, there will be three.  Look at operating systems (Win, Mac, Linux).  
And there are 140+ currencies floating around in the world. 
* Do you realize that a single SHA256 collision will lead to people migrating to litecoin?  
* Do you realize that litecoin is more distributed than BTC?  
I can feel the downvotes already, but downvotes can't change facts. 
Note:  I am a large holder of BTC--and I also have LTC as a hedge.  It was obvious from 2012 that ASICs would send all miners to LTC.  
Note2: The fact that won't post anything about other cryptos **except** these jokes is what smacks of desperation.  
There are trillions to be made, and these will be mostly (80%+) done on BTC.  But not 100%.

[Hayek's "Choice in Currency".](    
*A path-breaking essay by Hayek, newly in print in cooperation with the Institute of Economic Affairs, this piece first appeared in 1976, during an inflationary bout in the U.S.. Hayek saw that it was crucial to bring the forces of competition to bear in currency markets, not just between countries but within them as well.*
*All people should be free to use any currency of their own choosing, even if that means rejecting the favored domestic one. This provides a check against inflation, permitting citizens to keep assets denominated in any unit.*
*Governments, then, would have greater incentive avoid inflating because a depreciating unit would lead people to flee to other currencies. At least this would work as some check, and it would be a great improvement over the existing system in which citizens in a currency region are caged sheep led to the slaughter.*
*This is an important essay in many respects, because it represents a reform that could take place right now, one that would change the institutional incentives faced by central banks. This is not his full plan for sound money but rather a creative idea to diminish the total power of central banks within individual countries.*

Open Letter to Julia Gillard - 7 December 2010  
Dear Prime Minister,  
We note with concern the increasingly violent rhetoric directed towards Julian Assange of WikiLeaks.  
"We should treat Mr Assange the same way as other high-value terrorist targets: Kill him," writes conservative columnist Jeffrey T Kuhner in the Washington Times.  
William Kristol, former chief of staff to vice president Dan Quayle, asks, "Why can’t we use our various assets to harass, snatch or neutralize Julian Assange and his collaborators, wherever they are?"  
"Why isn’t Julian Assange dead?" writes the prominent US pundit Jonah Goldberg.  
"The CIA should have already killed Julian Assange," says John Hawkins on the Right Wing News site.  
Sarah Palin, a likely presidential candidate, compares Assange to an Al Qaeda leader; Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania senator and potential presidential contender, accuses Assange of "terrorism".  
And so on and so forth.

This is simple price discovery.  It doesn't move in a straight line.  People get euphoric, then people panic.  With 12 million BTC around, that's a small train and not many people can board it at this new price level.

That's a good idea &amp; totally decentralized.  Also it would be nice if all clients were alerted to hang on until the fork gets resolved.  
I would propose this 
  
--&gt; 1-block fork? 6 confirmations;   
--&gt; 2-block fork? 12 confirmations;     
--&gt; 3-block fork? 24 confirmations;     
--&gt; 4+ fork?  6*2^ confirmations. (which basically means, until further notice).  This could protect merchants and inform the entire network of an attack.
A system with [Antifragility]( must learn from this.  This is crucial information telling us how to prepare for an eventual attacker.  
I for one found it amazing how the ecosystem (of devs, miners, merchants) responded swiftly.  Yet there is much to learn here.

**16 days ago** I said [we were going to reach $200 in 3 months](
I still stand by it.  Please bear with me as I try to sound intelligent.
i) People have this fixed belief that "Diff follows price".  That WAS true in the days when any Ned Nerd could cranck up his GPU *after* a price rise, and forget that in a week after price fell. 
ii) Today, **the network dynamics have changed** as we've crossed a phase transition.  Diff has increased from 3mm this January to 260+mm today.  **Mining is now a capital-intensive business**, not a in-out as you wish. 
iii) There will come a seller's strike, as a) buyers from last year finally cash out their costs and take some profits, and b) miners wait for a return on investment.  Maybe it's already happening. 
At any rate, I'm just one more idiot in a world of 7,000,000,000 idiots.  What the hell do I know?  But my feeling is that the profit-takers are drying up, and the miners will hold for a better day. 
I know I will.

Painting an enormous number of intelligent people with a broad brush...
Occupy has a different philosophical perspective: 
* Against big TBTF banks; but for the FED (which is the enabler)  
* pro-inflation (they seem to have difficulty with the idea of never buying on credit, and only buying with savings--so inflation is "beneficial" to debtors--but of course it isn't, the banks are the first to touch the money)
**most of all**
They want the government to solve problems.  Not the individual or the small community.  Then they vote for someone, and the government gets 100 bucks, spends $90 on itself, and throws $10 on the problem.  
Our joint philosophy with occupy rests around:
* Big TBTF banks

Inverted totalitarianism
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Inverted totalitarianism is a term coined by political philosopher Sheldon Wolin to describe the emerging form of government of the United States. Wolin believes that the United States is increasingly turning into an illiberal democracy, and he uses the term "inverted totalitarianism" to illustrate the similarities and differences between the United States governmental system and totalitarian regimes such as Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union.[1][2][3][4]

Inverted totalitarianism and managed democracy[edit source | editbeta]
Wolin believes that the United States (which he refers to using the proper noun "Superpower", to emphasize the current position of the United States as the only superpower) has been increasingly taking on totalitarian tendencies as a result of the transformations that it underwent during the military mobilization required to fight the Axis powers, and during the subsequent campaign to contain the Soviet Union during the Cold War:[2]
While the versions of totalitarianism represented by Nazism and Fascism consolidated power by suppressing liberal political practices that had sunk only shallow cultural roots, Superpower represents a drive towards totality that draws from the setting where liberalism and democracy have been established for more than two centuries. It is Nazism turned upside-down, “inverted totalitarianism.” While it is a system that aspires to totality, it is driven by an ideology of the cost-effective rather than of a “master race” (Herrenvolk), by the material rather than the “ideal.”[5]
According to Wolin, there are three main ways in which inverted totalitarianism is the inverted form of classical totalitarianism.
Whereas in Nazi Germany the state dominated economic actors, in inverted totalitarianism, corporations through political contributions and lobbying, dominate the United States, with the government acting as the servant of large corporations. This is considered "normal" rather than corrupt.[6]
While the Nazi regime aimed at the constant political mobilization of the population, with its Nuremberg rallies, Hitler Youth, and so on, inverted totalitarianism aims for the mass of the population to be in a persistent state of political apathy. The only type of political activity expected or desired from the citizenry is voting. Low electoral turnouts are favorably received as an indication that the bulk of the population has given up hope that the government will ever help them.[7]
While the Nazis openly mocked democracy, the United States maintains the conceit that it is the model of democracy for the whole world.[8] Wolin writes:
Inverted totalitarianism reverses things. It is all politics all of the time but a politics largely untempered by the political. Party squabbles are occasionally on public display, and there is a frantic and continuous politics among factions of the party, interest groups, competing corporate powers, and rival media concerns. And there is, of course, the culminating moment of national elections when the attention of the nation is required to make a choice of personalities rather than a choice between alternatives. What is absent is the political, the commitment to finding where the common good lies amidst the welter of well-financed, highly organized, single-minded interests rabidly seeking governmental favors and overwhelming the practices of representative government and public administration by a sea of cash.[9]
Managed democracy[edit source | editbeta]
Wolin believes that the democracy of the United States is sanitized of political participation and refers to it as managed democracy. He defines managed democracy as "a political form in which governments are legitimated by elections that they have learned to control".[10] Under managed democracy, the electorate is prevented from having a significant impact on policies adopted by the state through the continuous employment of public relations techniques.[11]
Wolin believes that the United States resembles Nazi Germany in one major way without an inversion: the essential role that propaganda plays in the system. According to Wolin, whereas the production of propaganda was crudely centralized in Nazi Germany, in the United States it is left to highly concentrated media corporations, thus maintaining the illusion of a "free press".[12] Dissent is allowed, although the corporate media serves as a filter, allowing most people, with limited time available to keep themselves apprised of current events, only to hear points of view which the corporate media deems to be "serious".[4][13][14]
According to Wolin, the United States has two main totalizing dynamics:
The first, directed outward, finds its expression in the Global War on Terror and in the Bush Doctrine that the United States has the right to launch preemptive wars. This amounts to the United States seeing as illegitimate the attempt by any state to resist its domination.[4][14][15]
The second dynamic, directed inward, involves the subjection of the mass of the population to economic "rationalization", with continual "downsizing" and "outsourcing" of jobs abroad and dismantling of what remains of the welfare state created by U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Thus, neoliberalism is an integral component of inverted totalitarianism. The state of insecurity in which this places the public serves the useful function of making people feel helpless, thus making it less likely that they will become politically active, and thus helping to maintain the first dynamic.[4][14][16][17]

What about China calling itself "Republic", as in, say: 
"Republic calls for USA's dollar to be replaced as global reserve currency".

Sorry, it's patently false.  Scrypt is way harder than SHA2. It's possible (though very very very improbable) that SHA2 could fall and scrypt remain robust.  If that were to happen, a 51% attack would be inevitable on BTC, and we would see all sorts of mayhem: block reward of 1,000,000,000,000 btc, etc... 
But as I said, it's extremely improbable.  No collisions have ever been found... and many many collisions are generally needed until you see a hash function fail.  We would have ample warning to change the protocol, **if history is any guide**.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:46:55

Japan is now a trade deficit holder... they shut their nuclear reactors, and are importing energy, not to mention food.  Their exports to China have collapsed due to the Sengaku Islands situation.

That's also relative to your age and skills.  If you're young, no kids, and have skills to bring you back should you lose everything, a high-risk strategy can put you on the map.  
But if you're 55, 4 kids, and have been a janitor for all your life, putting your savings into anything new is extremely risky.
