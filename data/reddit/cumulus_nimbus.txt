Depends... P2sh (and thus segwit) is also using redeem scripts for a long time. And this scripts get derived in a deterministic way from your private key.
So, if you have your masteseed backup, you can restore your redeem scripts.

Channels arent necessary opened in a symmetric state. i.e you can run a node, fund one channel to get visible and hundred of other users can open channels to your node and fund them on their own.
But there will happen that some nodes are bigger and well connected than others (exchanges, payment processors, mining pools, etc... )
Nice thing about this "centralization" is, it's opt-in, if you don't like it, don't use it. If you have a centralized blockchain (eg. Bec. Of very big blocks, miners centralization, etc) you can not choose which layer to use

This is "just" a serialization format for partial signed transaction. You can not use the blockchain to exchange these not fully signed TX. You'd need a second channel for this. But I really like it and will make my life a lot easier.
Often have the need to pass around unsigned TX to have them signed later on by someone else.

If a blockchain shows its battle-hardened and has a lot (the most?) POW power behind it and offers immutable storage for very low cost, there will be nearly unlimited demand for immutable storage (you can even save your last vacation pictures on it, why not - if its so cheap?).
So, no matter how big your blocksize is, there will be users eating away your immutable storage until the fees rise, so that again your pay-your-coffee-onchain transactions get pushed out of the mempool. What then, just increase it further and repeat the cycle.

Yes - you can index the initial transactions, which consist of input commitments and output commitments. Which could later on get combined in a block where you dont see any ownership.
But the commitments in itself reveal nothing, no amount, no address or if its a change output, etc

Usually you have a masterseed for the onchain addresses of the wallet. Whenever a channel becomes unresponsive for a longer time the other side is supposed to close it to the before set address which can be redeemed with any normal wallet 
If the other side also does not uniliteral close it, ther are tools available to close a channel based on the masterseed, if the locktime is due (but this might also be wallet dependent)
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:03:59
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:26:32
One argument to send the masterseed to the backend could be to provide better performance for the balance lookup. Instead deriving all addresses clientside and querring each address individually, they can do it on their backend and just send the full UTXO set to the client. Much faster. But you can do the same with the xPub without compromising the users security
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:48:04
\&gt; and seed was on paper physically.
Just to make sure, can you clarify what you mean by this? Did you write the seed after initialization of the trezor on paper or was it already written on paper out of the box
(sorry, posted one level to deep)
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:22:45
There are other webwallets that don't need to send masterseeds to the backend, why you need to do this, and still call your wallet the most secure web wallet?

The only way that would be impressive, if they used the genesis-hash as public key (not as private key, as they did), because then the address is provable unspentable. 
And if they then spend from it, that would be earthshattering as they suggest. 
So it was just a normal bitcoin transaction with a not really random private key. Color me impressed.

There are (as far as I can see it) two reasons to mine empty blocks:
1) The miner wants to harm bitcoin by not mining pending transactions
2) Legitimate technical reasons (that short time period after the miner receives a new block)
I guess we are only talking about solving case 1) - or?
Lets say, the network enforces that blocks need to be at least 50% full and you are a miner from point 1) -&gt; You have already your mind made up to "leave money on the table" by not including legit transactions (and getting their fees), but you need to have 50% of tx in your block. So you generate transactions sending your coins in circles and filling up blocks.
The bad miner is now no way worse of than before the "blocks-need-to-be-at-least-this-full"-fix but you get the same harm done to the network. Even more now, because the blockchain is now growing unnecessary faster, which hurts the whole network on a different level.
If you want to only solve case 2) with it, you are again not helping the miners, because its not possible to reliable mine a full block while you are verifying a new incoming block.
And yes, i tried to read and understand your comments so far - but Im not sure I fully understand your reasoning

Bitcoin currently is not at Amazon-Scale - what should amazon do with a payment-solution that provides around 10tx/second globally, for all participants? amazon alone would congest the network if only a few percent of users used it.

I guess in most cases when you have to pay something is after a website shows you a QR code or a bitcoin:-link. (There are other cases, but i guess thats one of the most common ways on how to get a paymentrequest).
Now, if you dont use TOR the website knows your IP in a way more reliable way than relying on tx broadcast IPs. So - if you dont want them to know, you need TOR anyway.

How to you incentivize distributed and decentralizied miners to take care about your blockchain, whitout having a non-censorable, permissionless payment  system at hand?
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:07:21


If for some reason you are a miner and dont want to include pending transactions (which seems to be the case here), but other nodes are imposing a min-block size, then you simply include a lot of your own transactions sending money in circles - you dont lose mining fee on it, because you get it back again, because you are the miner.
So, a min-block requirement would technically work, but not solve the problem you try to fix with it
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:32:23


Why so? Its no difference between not including tx or including your own "fake" tx where you get the mining fee returned after mining the block.
The only difference is that your block has a slightly higher propagation delay and thus risk of getting orphaned. But if its a consensus rule to have a minimum size, than this affects all miners the same.
My point just is: it does not make sens to impose a min-block size, because it does not solve anything.

@_date: 2017-09-21 14:06:13
Ah okay - i thought your "That's false" was related to the "Of all the things blockchain has been applied to, cryptocurrency is the only one that really makes sense" from OP.
Because imo a Blockchain without having the incentive mechanism onchain is the only way it can work in a decentralized manner (ie. "private blockchains" or "blockchain without bitcoin" is a hocuspocus...)  But i guess thats your point also.
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:41:08
Okay, so you are saying enforcing a minimum block size does not work? ;)


if you enforce the minblocksize, the orphanrisk is mitigated, because every miner needs to have a fuller blocks and you cant outrun them anyway

If quantum attacks get to a point where you can calculate the privkey from the pubkey within 10mins (which we are far far away) then also not reusing addresses doesnt protect you, as an attacker can doublespent your newley broadcast and unconfirmed tx before a miner includes it into the blockchain

it stores a wallet.dat file in your user home direcory - its only a small file containing all the private keys you used. Now it needs to resync the blockchain and hopefully find the funds for the keys, if you ever owned bitcoin.
You can speed up the initial sync, if you set the db_cache (its in the settings) to about ~60-80% of you RAM and let it sync
