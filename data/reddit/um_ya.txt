It's not impossible. Poloniex arguably has more features than Bitfinex, and they seem to be doing just fine. It all comes down to competent coders. The only thing Bitfinex has over Poloniex, is BTC/USD margin trading.

Judging by the way bitgo is coded, the hacker could have gotten transactions signed without broadcasting them. They wouldn't trigger bitgo, because they get the transactions signed over the course of a few days, and they don't trigger bitfinex, because they never broadcasted the transactions. Then, on one day, they just broadcast all the transactions they had signed. Have you guys considered this scenario? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:27:08
If they actually used bitgo's withdraw limit, they wouldn't have this problem.

That's the stupidest thing I ever read. The reason you use margin, is because you're a good trader, not because you're a bad one. You make more money by using margin, but you can also lose more money.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:02:05
Because regulation is past looking rather than forward looking. The market comes up with a better solution forward looking, but not if they still have to conform to the past regulations.

Hedge funds and the private money managers make MOST of their money through options/margin trading. You have no idea what you're talking about. Whenever somebody says they're "Shorting" something, they are margin trading, because they're borrowing shares to sell.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:33:56
As a coder, I can tell you exactly why. Bitgo is a signing service, with only a few variables to work with. "maximum withrawal in a single transaction", "maximum withdrawal in a given day", "webhook when a transaction goes through (optional)", "whitelist of addresses to send to (optional)"... Bitfinex's mistake, is that they established individual user wallets, rather than a single hot wallet. Bitstamp uses a hot wallet with these policies, Bitfinex doesn't. If there are a thousand accounts with a balance of 10 bitcoins, a 200 bitcoin daily withdrawal limit will apply to every user individually, rather than the exchange as a whole. Therefore the hacker is able to take the coins from all the users, without running into any problems against Bitgo signing the transactions. Any competent coder could have figured this out while reading Bitgo's docs.

Might be able to pick it up cheap too. People might want to sell their tokens to get out of the exchange. Might be able to pick up some nice BFX tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:38:31
That's a misunderstanding of the problem. Bitgo wasn't the problem. Bitfinex's implementation of Bitgo was the problem.
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:29:45
Bitfinex has actually handled this situation very well.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:25:58
Unlikely. I think the bad move that Bitstamp took, was adding in all the new regulations. Bitfinex had a leg up, because you didn't have to jump through so many hoops to get an account and start trading. Bitstamp would become number one, if they got rid of some of their requirements, and added P2P lending for margin positions. As of right now, Bitfinex is the only one with BTC/USD margins. I can't find another good exchange that has it, other than Kraken, and they have heavy restrictions and requirements too. I just wish Bitfinex was coded well.

A better analogy would be that bitcoin transactions won't be used for every transaction on the network, they will just be used for opening and closing LN channels. Most of the transactions will be on the channels and will only be broadcast to the network during a dispute. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 19:58:23
There seems to be a lot of people that don't understand what lightning network is. There's zero centralization going on here. All it's doing, is making bitcoin transactions a way of opening and closing channels, rather than broadcasting every transaction on the network.

Yes. To mitigate this, you can either use a reputable channel, so they won't shut down, or you can set shorter time locks.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:26:43
What ever you set in your time-lock for the LN. For instance, If I set up a LN that auto closes in 1 year, then you need to be back on line before the end of the year.

Channel re-balancing in the sense that you send BTC to another person and then they send LN coins to the address you specify.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:14:53
Sure, people might gravitate towards a large player for low fees, but it doesn't mean they have to. If you care about privacy and security you might want to use a different LN channel. It's all up to you.

That's the purpose of the time lock in the transaction. It automatically closes the channel after the time lock expires, you can keep it open by initiating a new time lock though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:06:51
If you're an exchange, you'd have a channel set up or if you're a store and want costumers to make fast transactions you can have a channel setup.

The derivative graph is misleading. The value indicated in the derivatives is not representative of actual money, it is a representation of the way a derivative is calculated. If I want 1M at 2% I need to calculate the derivative's notional at 50M... In no way is anyone expected to come up with 50M dollars, it's just the way to calculate it. (floating rate * the notional = what you get)

If anyone curious, this is a known bug with blockchain.info. The problem arises when you create a new address locally but the address isn't propagated to the blockchain.info website.

Everything will be so much easier once we get fast, full homomorphic encryption.... A lot of progress lately though! :)
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:06:30
Homomorphic encryption allows servers (or hardware) to do zero knowledge work. For instance, lets say I have "2+2=?" I encrypt that and hand it to somebody else and they do "work" on the cypher text to get a cypher text solution that can only be decrypted by the original person, who can decrypt it to get "4".  
  
**TLDR;** A computer can calculate something like 2+2 to equal 4, without knowing the original equation or the solution it solved for. It solves in cypher text. [

From my understanding, the 1MB was set for node propagation reasons. The more you increase the block size, the harder it is to propagate to all the nodes. Only the nodes that can handle the large block size will be left, leaving centralization issues.

Sidechains, in principle, will work. They are using a federated peg at the moment, but there is implementations that don't require it... The idea is that we all don't have to agree on the implementation of bitcoin, because we can use all implementations that we want, and the risk is mitigated to our own discretion on which chain to use... If people want to stay at 1MB they can, and if people want to move to something else, they can. All this can be done without creating a hard fork or a new currency, once this technology is adopted.

Interesting, it's entirely possible to make a new Ethereum with a different blockchain excluding the attackers funds.

How am I suppose to allocate my labor where it is most needed? ....

Coinbase, and pretty much every large bitcoin exchange, does off chain transactions, because the 10min block time is too expensive and takes too long. I'm trying to start a company right now, but it is very difficult to make security when you have to worry about handling transactions offline. Luckily Blockstream should be making an announcement in the next few weeks that would allow side chains. Side chains would allow developers to not have to worry about implementing their own secure off chain transactions, rather, they would use faster side chain transactions.

You are correct that you have to report ownership, but you do not have to pay taxes on it. That's why I also explained that you could have a trust own the IBC for additional security. In which case you are a manager in the company and therefore not a beneficial owner (the beneficial owner is the trust), so you don't have to report anything.
@_date: 2017-05-07 00:12:25
... The fuck you smoking? The very reason segwit is a soft fork and not a hard fork, is the fact that it doesn't raise the block size. It just fits more transactions in the 1mb block. Segwit moves the transaction signatures out of the block and moves it to a segregated area (hence the name "segwit"), allowing for twice as many transactions inside the block because we don't have to worry about the signatures being in there too.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:58:18

@_date: 2017-05-06 02:56:17
This is a prediction without merit. The logical thing to do, is to do Segwit now with a soft fork and then if there is still capacity issues in the future, even with lightning network, then we can increase the blocksize in the future... Not to mention, segwit makes future block increases significantly cleaner and more robust, considering we don't have to worry about increased signature validation complexity.

It's not just about running it, its about miners actually getting paid for mining blocks. As bitcoin miners transition from getting paid through block reward, to getting paid through miner fees, what incentive is there to add a miner fee to your transaction, if you can send one without a miner fee and still get in? For instance, if the block size was 1gb there would be no transactions waiting in mempool. Why should I pay a fee if my transaction will get added in the next block, regardless of what my miner fee is? It worked in early bitcoin, because miners received enough from the block reward, but it won't work in the future as block rewards continue to decrease.
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:35:59
If you have a trust company own the IBC, then you are not subject to reporting. The IBC controls the trust, and the trust owns the IBC, then you appoint yourself as manager of the IBC and settler of the trust. In this way, you have ownership as manager and are not beneficial owners.

You misunderstood what the problem was. When a user makes a request, and I capture it, I can modify the parameter (say I change the withdraw parameter from $5 to $30). Bitstamp's API will withdraw the $30. If you put the post data within the signature, then the server won't accept it (which Bitstamp doesn't implement).  
  
Check BTC-e and Kraken's APIs for reference of how it should be.

Ah, that's probably where the confusion is then. So moving the signature out of a high weighted area allowed more transactions to be fit in. So I suppose you can say it's still "in the block", but you can never get the capacity of the 4mb they allow, like what most people think.

Easiest option is to make a transaction to yourself that includes your change from your previous transaction, making sure to have a higher fee.

No such proposal exists right now, but yes, in theory you are correct, you would double the block size and then double the capacity with segwit. Which would give you 4x current capacity. This is not a worthwhile proposal, because a hard fork would still be necessary to get the 2mb blocks, which is the very reason why core is resistant to any block size increase at the time. It's not because "core hates bitcoin scaling", its because core knows what the fuck they're doing, and don't take unnecessary hardfork risks when they don't have to.

A valuation is an estimate on the worth of a company, not the actual worth. Here, you are looking at the REAL market cap of bitcoin vs the ESTIMATED value of a company. When you see a 51 billion dollar valuation for Uber, nobody has actually payed 51 billion dollars for them.

The arbitrage loop is trapped, because you can't deposit and withdrawal USD. Therefore people that want to get money out of the exchange have to buy BTC on bitfinex and sell on a different exchange. This causes the BTC price on bitfinex to be higher than the other exchanges. As soon as they allow USD deposits/withdrawals again, the spread between the exchanges will come closer together... People keep attributing this to GOX, because GOX had the same problem, the only difference is that GOX was running a fractional reserve, which means as people withdrew BTC, they didn't have the coins to cover what was being withdrawn. Bitfinex (most believe) has all of its reserves, so it's not a really big deal.... If you want to see the opposite of this in action, you can look at OKCOIN exchange. OKCOIN has a BTC withdrawal hold, which means the price is lower than market price, because if people want to get money out, their only option is to sell BTC on the exchange and withdraw it through a bank transfer. Price on Bitfinex is artificially high and price on OKCOIN is artificially low. The correct market price is reflected through Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken right now.

The guy goes to great lengths *claiming* he's Satoshi, but **REFUSES** the most basic verification. All he needs to do is sign a message from one of Satoshi's addresses saying "I'm Craig Wright"....

It is still 1 mb. Notice where it says "stripped size: 731.2 kb" this is the actual block. The "Size: 1.7 mb" represents the block PLUS the segregated witness data that comes along with the block. The actual block is still below 1 mb.

Plus, you don't need to send a transaction to prove he was Satoshi... If he really did sign that message in front of Gavin, then we know that he would have the key. He should be able to sign a message and release it to us... Since he's a scammer, we know why he can't do this.

This is essentially the same problem that I mentioned earlier, except they're trying to mitigate that risk using their REP system. A similar REP system can be done outside of crypto to work with bitcoin. You just create a website and you rank the verifiers against each other, then a user would select a verifier based on their ranking. They get a public key of the verifier through the website and then make a multisig address with them. They can now verify by signing their portion of the multisig transaction. The result is the same, except you can do all of this offchain rather than storing all sorts of data onchain like Ethereum does.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:27:42

No, it doesn't confirm anything you said. The routing problem is solved, if you go through well connected routes. What you're referring to is decentralized routing problem... The benefits of decentralized routing are, can't be shut down and anonymous transactions. Both can be done with LN as it stands. If the well connected node you are using shuts down, you can just get a new one, and if you want anonymous transactions, you can choose to use a node that advertises anonymous transactions. And, if you aren't satisfied with that, you can come up with a better solution, perhaps a marketplace of nodes, or an onion like routing service to tell you which route to take or which nodes to establish a connection with. The real issue here, is that you are *LOOKING* for a problem with it, and you are never satisfied because of your preconceived hatred for it.
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:50:44
I believe this is only relevant to people that accept 0 conf. transactions (which you shouldn't be doing anyway). This doesn't affect most businesses that accept your transaction after you get confirmations... Correct me if I'm wrong.

The problem with Ethereum and it's smart contracts, is that there is very little you can do without compromising the security of your smart contracts. For instance, if I want to make a smart contract that pays me a certain amount of money if the Miami Heat win a basketball game, the elements that verifies whether they won or not, is the weak point. The system is only secure if all input variables are within the confines of the system. There is no point in making a smart contract on top of Ethereum if the logistics of it can be done in a regular program. If you wanted to do a similar smart contract with bitcoin, you could create a multisig key where the verifyer signs their half of the transaction if the outcome is right. The result is the same.

No, with segwit the capacity would double AND you can do instant transactions at zero cost with Lightning Network. With segwit, Bitcoin transactions can be ways to open and close LN channels where you can do as many transactions you want instantly when the channel is opened. Right now, we're storing every "coffee transaction" on the blockchain, when we should be storing every channel opening/closing on the blockchain instead. BU just wants to increase the blocksize, allowing more "coffee transactions" on the blockchain, but that isn't a scaleable solution when it comes to Visa scale. In order for bitcoin to be like Visa, we would need over 100mb blocks. With LN, we can scale without having to do that.

To give you the skinny. If you make a transaction on one chain with coins you had before the fork, the signature can be relayed to the other ethereum network and be valid there too. Since your key is the same and your transaction inputs are the same, the transaction is the same. People with coins in cold storage think that they can make a quick buck by sending their ETC coins to an exchange and then selling them, but what they don't realize, is that they will also be sending their ETH coins to that same address. Transactions can be relayed on both chains. This causes a whole host of problems.
