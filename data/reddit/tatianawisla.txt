Unless the ToS specifies the forfeiture of account funds for violating the ToS, the exchange has no rights to the funds and should be returned once the account is closed/frozen.  Should have no trouble having a judge agree with this.  Other users should avoid companies that do these shenanigans.  You maybe next.

In their [Terms of Use](


BTC is a currency.  Send them a wallet for the refund.
Nowhere in their Terms of Use, or ToS, does the user forfeit any currencies or crypto-currencies.  Since the OP is under 18, ToU isn't binding anyways.  Funds must be returned.
It's pretty shitty of them pulling this stunt and it's not worth the bad PR.  It's a warning to the rest of you.  If they can do this, imagine what they can do to you at their whim.
I'm probably wrong, but I think a rogue support agent has control over OP account, gives 3 btc and tell OP to fuck off, and if OP doesn't escalate, proceed to steal remaining btc.  Yeah, [this shit]( never happens.

Your short-term thinking can't see the big implications of crypto that go well beyond high fees and big dips seen today.
The Internet wasn't built in a day and neither were any of the other technologies mentioned.  Bitcoin is nowhere ready for mainstream global adoption.  It doesn't scale right now.  We know this.  But it will one day and I'm betting on it regardless of what's occurring today.
Today's cars look nothing like the first ones.  It took a little time, but they did eventually replace all the horse and buggies.  The same will happen to money.
Don't dismiss the technology because of a few issues that will eventually be resolved.  We're smart.  We'll figure it out.  That's what we do.
On the other hand, if you're a speculator / trader, then by all means, you should sell in a down trend.  Buy low, sell high, all that kind of shit.  Good luck.

You can only offset a gain with your loss.  I you have no gains to record this year, you can't claim the loss.  But the loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be claimed against future gains.  You can offset any gain with the loss and any portion left over can be carried over.

Here's another.
They were once a monopoly.  Lots of profits but little re-invested in growth/business.
Like most monopolies, they fail to innovate past their first success thinking they'll always be a monopoly.
Just look at Microsoft's DOS era, absolutely no innovations until the competition came around.  Look how long we endured with Windows 95 crashing all the freakn' time.
Look at RIMM, sat on their asses while management robbed them blind and into oblivion.
MtGox just didn't re-invest enough back into the business and the competition caught up.  No amount of PR, good news or innovation is going to help them now.  Too little, too late.  They've alienated their user base and tarnished their reputation.  Let that be a lesson to the rest of them and any other business for that matter.
MtGox, if you're listening...you should have hired a PR team long ago...and a security team...and spent a little more on QA and coders...expanded customer support...so sad...don't feel bad K...not everyone is cut out to be a good business man.

Want to really stop them making money from your hard work?
Pay off your debts.  You shouldn't be  under so much debt.  A little maybe, but not at the levels like today.
Paying off debts extinguishes money but buying bitcoin only moves money/problem to someone else.
Also, by spending your money into material things, you gain wealth which is a bit harder to tax and squeeze money out of (this includes bitcoin.)  Not to mention your savings don't dwindle in value, but your possession may, so buy wisely, i.e., don't buy China crap that don't last 5 minutes.  But pay off your debts first.  Don't be a slave to debt (where they want you to be.)

In legal terms, the inclusion of one is the exclusion of all others.  The second sentence has the words, "'Money' includes...," which means money can only be a unit of account established by an intergovernmental organization (which bitcoin is not) or by agreement between two or more governments (again, which bitcoin is not.)
So it appears that bitcoin, in this context, is NOT money.  It may be written in a way that sounds like it is, but if you read this through legal eyes, it isn't.
The only way they can make it money is if the government writes appropriate law defining and stating what bitcoin is.  Anything else is just policy and their opinion/interpretation of the law.

From the looks of commit numbers alone, it appears BU won't be adding as many features/benefits to bitcoin apart from a bigger blocksize that requires a dangerous hard fork.  Fewer commits are likely less changes.
Bitcoin needs to grow in capacity and capability.  If I had any say in this debate, I'd go with Core.  I'm not ready to abandon Core just yet for a fork.

The meaning of "money laundering" has gone from "hiding the origins of illegally gotten gains" to "any transaction that can't be traced to an individual."
So, if you're paying in cash, you're "money laundering" as far as the government cares.  And, boy, do they care.  They've even passed laws banning any cash transaction over a certain amount.
Same goes for crypto.  Anonymous peer-to-peer transaction, that's money laundering in their view.
They will not be satisfied until they account for every last penny, thinking it's going so solve every crime or act of terrorism.  Haha, dumb-asses.

I don't think Peter is as stupid as he leads himself to be.
His whole business model and life revolves around him peddling gold.  He is well entrenched and significantly experienced with gold.  It would be business suicide to advocate something better than gold of which he has little knowledge or experience with.
He's a victim of his own success.  If he is unable to make the transition to the new money, he will surely be left behind.
Having said that, I've listened to both of them individually and find Andreas more convincing than Peter.  Peter can't tell me anything more about gold than I already know and argues why crypto is bad.  Andreas argues why crypto is better.
And, frankly, while crypto today is still young and developing, it is much better than gold will ever be.  There's a reason you see automobiles instead to horse drawn carriages.

Option 1: Mine
2 year contract is 364 * 2 = 728 days.
Current daily return is $0.51-$0.20 fee = $0.31 / day * 728 days = $225.68^*
^* Only if hashrate remains the same for two years.  This is extremely unlikely and returns will be substantially lower even after 6 months.
Or look at it this way.  291 sats / day ($0.51-$0.20fee) * 728 days = 211848 sats = 0.00211848 BTC = 2.1 mBTC
Even if $0.51 per day includes fee = 478 sats * 728 days = 347984 sats = 0.00347984 BTC = 3.5 mBTC
This is a best case scenario.  You are likely to loose it all as the daily fee near the end eats away all the profits you made earlier as daily returns can't cover the fee.
Option 2: Buy
$179.98 * $11000 (current price) = 0.016361818 BTC = 16.4 mBTC immediately, not 2 years later
And you get greater return as BTC rises to, hopefully, 100K within the two years.
TLDR; You'd be an idiot to mine this way, so, buy and don't look back.

We've been given the gift of financial freedom and it's up to us to exercise it and find our way.  He's done all he could and now it's in our hands.
Satoshi's vision was to put the power of bitcoins in everyone's hands.  If it can't do that, then he has failed.  Bitcoin's issues are our issues, and we must work them out together, for everyone's interest.  If crypto-currency fails, we're back to the status quo, square one.
I doubt anything Satoshi says would change anything at this point.  Bitcoin will constantly fight for it's life, forever.  The world is filled with bad actors and there's always one around every corner.
Things will work themselves out if enough people want it.  We will squeeze out the bad actors.  We have to if Bitcoin is to survive.  Fortunately for us, majority rules.  That is the rule of Bitcoin.

It would be a great way to protect BTC, every time a forked shitcoin would occur, he'd sell his millions of shitcoins driving their price to zero, ensuring BTC keep it's value.
I figure, at some point in the not to distant future, BTC may need some serious coins to protect against an adversary or attack.  Maybe he's saving his coins for this eventuality.  Although the 2x attack is contentious, I don't believe we're there yet.
Then again, seeing how well these shitcoin forks are doing, maybe it's not needed.

Oh no, they don't print more money to pay for interest.  You pay the interest from foreclosures, loan defaults, business failures, bankruptcies, etc.  Anything where somebody loses something, like property, collateral, etc.
The printing of money is just the government making cash for itself because it doesn't collect enough from us to pay for everything, including the money it just printed.  Yes, the government pays interest on money they asked the FED to create (they literally pulled money out of their ass that everyone pays interest on.)
They couldn't care less if you pay your interest.  What they're really interested in is getting hands on your property.  Interest is just a means.  That's why money to pay the interest doesn't exist.  You pay interest through wealth transfer.  Something that used to belong to you now belongs to them.  It can be anything.  Your property, labor, your children, etc.
If you're debt free, you're one of the lucky ones.  If you're drowning in debt, my God have mercy on your soul and pay back that shit as fast as you can.
Video translation: Inflation is the debasement of the currency.  Here at the FED, we adjust the debasement to assure the people don't fight back and panic as we rape them in the ass, maximize wealth transfer, and to keep you paying your interest like a good little slave (because if you do, somebody else has to eventually lose their shit.)

If his wallet is protected with a relatively strong password, then the government hasn't seized anything.  They probably seized an encrypted wallet.
On the other hand, it he voluntarily hands over the password giving access to the private keys as part of a plea deal, then yeah, the government would then have seized bitcoins.
Either way, he's fucked, so I don't think he would get much more benefit from handing over the keys.  27,000 bitcoins is roughly 3.5 million.  They have to make me a very sweet deal to get him to hand over the private keys.
War on drugs is still ongoing because it's so profitable for them and it's very critical they get to the money behind the operation.  If they can't get to the money, they might not be so willing to go after the bad guys if they don't benefit from it somehow.  Bitcoins changes the game a bit.

The total amount of bitcoins ever will be 21 million.  But they are infinitely divisible.  Right now, they can each be divided 100 million times (1 satoshi.)
When there isn't enough to go around, we'll divide them up some more, but that won't happen for a little while.

Customer A who wants to cash out his 100 for $100,000 must first have a buyer willing to pay $100,000 for his 100.  Otherwise he's not "cashing out."
For ever buyer, there must be a seller and vice-versa.  The exachange just take a cut of each transaction...on both sides.

Sure, at today's price, you'll never see ROI.  But that 0.16 BTC per day is worth $80 USD per day when Bitcoin will eventually (highly probable) hit $500 USD/ 1.0 BTC.
So your 60GH/s miner maybe making money and ROI without you knowing it.  Well, not until the value of BTC rises enough to break even.  Then it's all gravy...or icing.
This is only true if you bought with $USD.  If you bought it with bitcoin, sorry, it'll never ROI.  You would have been better off buying bitcoins instead.
edit: clarification

Current network hash rate: 5011.70 petaHashes/sec
OP hashrate: 4462 kiloHash/sec
Equals: 4.462 megaHash/sec
Equals: 0.004462 gigaHash/sec
Equals: 0.000004462 teraHash/sec
Equals: 0.000000004462 petaHases/sec
So odds are 5011.70/0.000000004462 = 1123195876288 to 1
You are better off buying lottery tickets.

If new ideas benefits Bitcoin, it would simply integrate it into itself.  Bitcoin is not static, it's fluid and changing.  It can and will adapt to new environments, provided the majority supports the changes.  There may be altcoins, but for me there will be no other.  Anything else is just a copycat and wantabe.  Remember the million dollar home page and the millions of copycats that failed.
"There can be only one."

payout is about the same whether in a pool or not, but pools pay way more often and consistently.  you are better in a pool.
