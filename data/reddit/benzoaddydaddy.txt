Trivial transactions? lol. The whole point of bitcoin is to replace fiat currency, right? How does currency work? By exchanging it for goods and services, no matter how small.

Bitcoin fees are outrageous. I withdrew $75, from my balance of $120 on BitPay. I received $63 and my remaining balance is $20 LOL. WTF

So it was a fractional amount. Like 
.00084 it came out to $120. So I did make some in it. 
My point is that anyone who purchases it at current levels needs significant upside to make any gains because of transactional costs.

I found bitcoin in an old wallet and tried to withdraw it. What’s the point of buying an asset if you can literally only sell it at a loss?

17.61% to be exact. Plus BitPay’s cut. Absurd.

Please explain how bitcoin is usable in its current form?

What if bitcoin goes to 100,000? What then? Will fees decrease? Will confirms speed up?

They can get stolen. The tech isn’t impenetrable.

The point is non technical investors are still intimidated by it, for good reason. Even tech savvy individuals can lose their investments via exchange exit scam, etc.

Yeah bitcoin is stable as I see it plummet 25% in one day. I don’t know many “hedges” in the world that fluctuate a quarter of their value in a single day. lol wtf
