Not total garbage. Just comparing apples to oranges.

I'm banking profit from mine in 15 days, and it's not slowing down. No one is "lucky", it's just math. 
Cloud mining isn't a scam, it's just an investment that comes with its own risks.
Your post just looks like a bunch of quick math trying to prove a point. I have personal evidence in my own wallet that refutes everything you said. It's ok to make accusations, just try to have something to back it up with :/

Looking at it from strictly a dollar-for-dollar standpoint, I am expending electricity in a wasteful way. However, I don't see this as strictly dollar-for-dollar.  
Some may look at it as paying out of pocket because they want to be part of the network. For me, l I think it's a lot of that, and also the belief it will be worth more later... so an investment, albeit not as straightforward as buying it outright and putting it in cold storage.  It's fun to accumulate the old fashion way :)

I only mine ETH, XMR and a few others with GPUs. It's just a little 6 GPU project rig. I'm not pointing it at nicehash if that's what you're wondering.

Yes, I would know if I mined a block, though I never have. I always mine pool for Bitcoin. :)
I've only ever mined blocks on Bytecoin, Monero and Emercoin blockchains.

I see where you're coming from. Financially, if I wanted to be fiscal, I could easily just run a node. That's not what I want to do though.

Username checks out.
When you've been around as long as me, you've tried just about all of them.  Not everyone had the privilege of having the field combed out before jumping in :)

Thanks for the tip!
Yes, the antminers are what I'm talking about in the post.  GPUs have been more a fun experiment for me. When I do run them, it's usually just ETH now.

In light of the SEC and CFTC hearing this week, which cast a positive light on cryptocurrency in general, I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this. 
In 2018, I believe, we'll see a lot of new or prior-existing projects that will align themselves with regulation, and file all necessary paperwork. These guys look like they have the know-how, and are starting early.
Definitely worth checking out, imho.

I agree. I anticipate that more journalists will try to spin these forks in a way to bolster their argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. 
In the end, just another fruitless attack to work its way out of the system.

He's salty from a poor trade.  He needs to go 10x long from here to feel better,  but he'll need to take out loans to do that.

Against XRP and XLM holdings, then yes, I'd agree.
