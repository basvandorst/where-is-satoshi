I know it's designed this way but can it be re-designed in another way? No need to be so damn patronising like you're all that ��

�� Wow, you really are an asshole. I'm not saying let's change the algorithm, I'm asking a question. You saying POW is designed that way blah blah blah doesn't change my question and also doesn't answer it. Try to think outside the box.

No, I'm not. But maybe I should be? ��

Yes but I think I have a way around it.

I have what I think is a potentially good idea in relation to a crypto currency purchasing site using PayPal. But I don't know enough about coding or any coins to know if it really is plausable. Any genuine people willing to help?

I know that's the case but I'm not sure here is the right place to post about a potential business. Is there anywhere where I can talk to someone about it that you know about?

So, let's say you used a different system where instead of buying directly using paypal, you bought basically "tokens" on a website that represented your money in it's entire amount in $. Then those tokens could be used to buy coins and turned back into real money on the other side?

I hear ya, the only problem here is that this is a consumer product where the US value is important to the users investing. But accumulation of Bitcoin as the  priority is 100% the message we're trying to communicate to our users :)
