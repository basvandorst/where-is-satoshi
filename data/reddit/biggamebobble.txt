It's not like anyone would want to buy after being a verified customer Coinbase... Been verified for years and now I suddenly have to verify. Can't on my computer because no webcam and the app won't load the verification on mobile. Way to suck.

That dumbass chart has been around for 6 years bro
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:28:51
The charts looks hilarious and sad at the same time
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:00:27
Gonna be a butt clencher 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:52
14k could go either way
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:41
Buy walls getting thumped
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:53:36
And we going down again
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:46:41
You sure about that in a couple hours?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:22:09
BCH is being pumped so hard right now. Completely obvious. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:59
A lot of people with money are doing this all the time already...
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:26:40
Just an app that rings if it goes up down a certain set percentage. It was for ETH but if daddy is going down so is the rest of the ship. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:23:27
When I grow up I wanna be a miner.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:22:07
I'm in mostly ETH but Wheeee indeed
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:22:02
Woke up to snow and an alert that shit is getting dicey again. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:42
Doubtful, people are in a bit of a panic and when CB allows trading I think it will get dumped. Don't use this as advice though, no one really knows for sure. =(
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:34:05
Did the media help this bubble? New money came in and the price shot up. Where is the new money going to come from right now? I just don't see the bleeding stopping anytime soon.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:46:46
As long as he keeps it when tested. If not... well...
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:13:30
Still pending BTC/USD from 2 days ago. True
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:02:37
What is everyone's thought for the crash? I think the media played a big role. Never saw the exposure of Bitcoin like I have the last few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:42:28
14.2k gonna get tested. Better hope that holds.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:08
Is it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:07:31
I saw banking commercials touting blockchain and front page of new sites. Hindsight is 20/20 i suppose.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:03:19
He wants cheap coins because he missed the bus
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:54
No buyers?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:48
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:49:10
Shit is about to drop like a rock
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:34
Sorry =(
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:32
Kinda scary to throw money with this volatility? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:46:28
Unreal lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:04
The blood hasn't started flowing yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:33:42
Sell orders are shifting up it seems.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:21
It's for sure going to drop from now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:32
13.2k Bitstamp 12.8 Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:46:24
Sell pressure? Buy walls moving lower when touched. The "bubble" hasn't even started to pop imo.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:20:48
With 2k swings every 15 minutes I don't think the buys can keep up with whales that are selling. They are selling and getting in lower and repeating. Can the buying really hold up to this? Asking because I am not sure at all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:14:57
Rare find! Same here, good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:25:20
You don't say? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:37
Wish I had the capitol to do things like that. Sounds awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:15
Big buy wall @ 14.1K
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:44
You sure?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:57
I think 10k will be touched sadly
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:28
15 lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:47:57
I'm not 100% so I won't answer; surely someone smarter than me will.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:57
I tend to agree. I just don't see new money buying in right now. People are losing their ass and want to get out. It's going to get ugly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:35
Because you don't know the bottom?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:28:17
The fees are crazy
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:19
Most people just got in due to the media and got burned hard.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:19:00
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:50:17
They care about money; I agree but nothing is gonna change sadly.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:39:57
Link is red on WOT. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:36:34
Wall got ate
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:39:46
Pit of Misery again
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:35
918 T Town?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:54:49
Got some ETH earlier and it's went up. Nice
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:56
15k then dumped back to 13k
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:27:40
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:37
Under 14k here we come
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:47
Think we get stuck @ 13.5k
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:45:13
This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:52
Careful out there... Think it's not even close to falling and we will go down substantially soon (13.4k now).
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:03
GDAX down....
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:32
People sure are building buy walls. Wonder if they hold them if tested. Might be a trap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:29:58
Big investors pumping it to make it seem like the new get rich thing?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:26
That price point will be very telling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:47:47
You are asking Reddit? People with coins will say buy and people that  want to get in will say sell...
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:37
Yes, could just remove it to and let it drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:31:53
This didn't age well
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:39
It's going lower, I'd bet 10k is touched. This is no where near done.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:35:41
Should see 14k no idea beyond that
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:33
Was 65 buy wall that got ate in 2 seconds but hasn't been touched since. Looked like it was but I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:51:56
That 250 buy order is going to be telling @ 14.2k
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:49:01
Hot take
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:47:15
Bitcoin Checker on Android
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:29
What charts is everyone using? I'm on bitcoinwisdom right now. Anything better?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:57
100% wrong
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:11:33
Making a steady upward tick but I think it might get dumped =(
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:39
-25% in a week is not a crash?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:34:19
CLEAN COAL!
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:46:24
Media ruins everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:43:40
Back to 12k incoming
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:31
Here comes the test lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:25
Only coin I got in on today was ETH at $545.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:10:48
You got me for now! I whiffed so far.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:15
Here comes the downward pressure again
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:59:18
15k looks tough =/
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:57:51
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:23:02
Buy 2, get value of 1
