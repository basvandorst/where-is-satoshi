Their data is wrong a lot. They also do the cost basis of the alt you buy separately from the profit on the alt you sold. Double check everything. 
This is good for checking the difference between profit-value and cost-basis - sort by "Spread".

Are you trying to figure out what to do about it or how to profit off it? Cause understanding it and understanding how other people feel about it are two different things.

Seems like it depends on what the bulk of advice people get about what to do: sell or hold tight.

Set up an account at CoinBase, then send the coins from Multibit to your CoinBase account, and then sell them for USD, then you can withdraw that USD to your bank account.

If people are getting the advice and/or just feel safer selling out before it happens, the price will start to go down until it happens and then it will rapidly rise after its over as people buy back in. 
Of course many people hodl no matter what so it won't crash to zero or anything. But if you keep some fiat on the exchange you could maybe pick up some cheap coins.

I don't think people will buy back in until the question of which chain is going to continue is settled.
