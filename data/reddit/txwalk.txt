As Fees earned are likely to be designated as taxable income in many countries, What is to prevent the fees from upward spiral due to offset of cost and taxes? Would it doom the experiment locking out the normally disenfranchised? What are all the future pitfalls of the model taking into account the greed of corporations and need to show profits to shareholders?

Is the wallet signed? How do we *know* it’s Silk Road coins and not the MtGox settlement and redistribution of the locked coins? 160,000 BTC and 168,000 BCH there. Splitting to multiple wallet addresses lowers the potential attack risks.

Clearly the words “investing”, “investor”, and “investment” can no longer be used in the context of this shit. Throwing your money to the wind, pissing away your savings, are more fitting than “investing”. Nobody “invests” for this amount of loss.

 “Oversold is a condition in which the price of an underlying asset has fallen sharply to a level below where its true value resides. This condition is usually a result of market overreaction or panic selling and is generally considered short term in nature.”

All Peter has to do is ask him in court to move 0.0001 btc from the known Satoshi Nakamoto addresses.

What if Satoshi *lost his keys* to every known address?     
You can’t really be serious.      
     
What if Satoshi Nakamoto was Nick Szabo.    
Or even Hal Finney.      
      
What if personnel of the National Security Agency were publishing under the collective pseudonym of    
a Satoshi Nakamoto.
A reasonable and sound mind wouldn’t accept “What if’s” when it is so easy to prove to everyone, by using the very technology he claims to have invented, to provide that proof.

Not true. Libra could be exchange traded for bitcoin in a BTC/Libra pair. Unlike Xoom. Libra could and would make the on-ramping of fiat much easier.
@_date: 2019-06-19 05:53:09
Because bitcoin actually has usage, unlike high block sized coins. With bitcoin's volume, the blocks would take too long to propagate through the massive network leading to reordering and non-consensus issues. To sum it up as nontechnical as possible.

20 million new accounts on exchanges since November 2017. Most of those people lost big money to scams and falling prices. They account for almost 70% of everyone currently in crypto. Having lost huge amounts of money, they are panicking, exiting and never coming back to crypto. Banks are preventing the previously easy fiat on-boarding to crypto markets by restricting credit and debit card purchases (and soon wire transfers). Without the ease of buying cryptos and people thinking they are so smart by shorting they are forcing the market price lower. Except there are no longer the new buyers to pick up the falling price. Everyone outside of the current crypto community only sees that it was once $20k and now is $8k and is not willing to ever risk their money in such a market. The further it falls, the less people that will ever buy in or accept the idea of crypto without it offering some massive benefit of profit to them personally, they’d rather risk it in the equity market and get the government support and taxation benefits.

I suppose the one consolation to the low bitcoin price is that BitMain (and the other manufacturers) will soon have to be offering ASIC miners at more than a 50% discount just so purchasers might break even by the halving in 2020.

Bakkt satisfies the regulatory requirements of the insanely large managed funds  like pension funds, enabling them to finally invest or hedge. Whose members, with trillions of dollars in investments (over USD $28 Trillion to be more exact)  have sadly been locked out of the crypto market previously due to those requirements. Bakkt is not for the small investor holding or trading 0.1 BTC. Yet.

It’s still listed on major exchanges. Until that changes it isn’t dying. When it’s $100 it will be a much better buy than Bitcoin and will surge past in value. The whole idea is counterproductive.

I’m implying that you are NOT going to educate anything even close to 20% of all the possible current and future buyers of BTC. So if you want any adoption at all. That must be considered.

What exactly is adoption if it’s not the general public involved? So if the general public should stay out of BTC who’s it for and what’s its goal?

The general talk in US is that further losses will make it easy for regulators to impose detrimental regulations due to its dangers of losses. So I suspect it’s almost there anyway. Probably won’t be too much longer before US citizens will be shadow banned from foreign trading platforms and then shadow banned from crypto entirely through harmful regulations under the guise of protecting consumers.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:52:05
Is it an investment? Is that what it is for and all that it will ever be? Maybe the devs and miners need to make a decision on what exactly it is? And if it’s an investment then it’s not looking like a good one to 99% of the rest of the world right now. So that’s also not good for adoption or an asset class.

You WERE on the brink. Effed that up with the dumping in December. Prove me wrong in time, I sincerely hope you can though I also sincerely doubt it.

Not if you ever want to visit the US again! You will be indicted in absentia for tax evasion and arrested at the airport if you ever return. Millions can’t just up and leave the US and go elsewhere! And they cannot trade their cryptos at every price drop or increase. Every trade is a taxable event. So in US you have no option but to HODL or suffer the tax losses and get out of crypto entirely.

Except for the 70% of everyone in the market that bought at higher than $3000 after October. So you need to prepare for at least 3 more years for hope of any recovery to today’s levels. Think of the fun you’ll have and friends you’ll make in the meantime. So what if you’re 25 lbs heavier from sitting in front of your monitor 24/7. You might break even in the end.

BCrash isn’t dying. The crypto market in general however, is. Bitcoin would have to go to $30k and then drop to ever get the general public reinterested in crypto. They would need to see that any ATH can eventually be surpassed so they can confidently hold through the downs.

@_date: 2018-04-05 17:56:30
No. I’m equating interest with price. There is no interest so there will be no adoption. There is no interest because the general public has seen that bitcoin can drop by $14000 and not quickly recover. Which is extremely dangerous for those who would adopt it. They are scared away for many years, if not permanently.
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:05:43
Except that 70% of the people in the market are new and only see it since the ATH.

Nope in the US each trade is taxable. If you buy 0.5 bitcoin at $6500 and it goes to $6520 you subtract the trading fee if any then are taxed on the remainder. Same for any crypto to crypto trades (including tether). If you make a hundred profitable trades and then lose it all, you still owe massive taxes on the hundred profitable trades.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:22:43

@_date: 2018-04-05 18:21:53
Not a thing to the public at large. The only thing they will see for years without another ATH soon is that millions of people lost most of their money by putting it in. So they won’t be interested in putting in a cent, let alone a dollar.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:38:02
Except that the conditions of any time in previous history are no longer the same. There are no easy entry places in the US for onboarding fiat. Banks around the world are starting to prevent crypto transactions and ceasing services to anyone involved in crypto. Tax laws are taking any potential profits and the disdain for crypto in the general public is palpable. No one outside of crypto is interested. In fact quite the opposite now. I’m guessing if everything stays just as it is today with no further preventative / prohibitive regulations this will eventually go to $1k bounce back to $2k, down to $500 then $0.1, there will be no December bull run. If the regulations come, it will be the same, only faster.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:51:23
You’re thinking that the US regulators won’t start preventing people from buying it legally. I tend to think they will make it illegal as soon as a digital dollar is available. So there will be no cooling off period, only further cooling until completely frozen. Crypto will be back underground permanently. Blockchain companies will flourish on the equity markets. Cash settled futures markets Ike CBOE and CME will see increased activity. Further interest in cryptocurrencies will go the way of the fidget spinner. Not gone, but quite pointless.
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:08:14
Nobody did that. They were just starting to buy in. If you won’t buy in at $8100 now why the hell would you buy in at $8100 later after a big drop? Makes no sense at all. By that logic you're heading for consistently lower highs is all.
