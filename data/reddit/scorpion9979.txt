I guess with the kind of budget they may have, Gavin's crap could beat whatever we have on the table. We are a pretty small team on unexperienced crypto enthusiasts, but what we lack in experience we make up for in ambition and hard work.

I'm well aware off that. I've tried anywhere else and had no luck. I've noticed some bounties around here though, although the payment we are offering here won't be in BTC.

Thanks for the wonderful insight.

We have a lot of things going on. We are a fork from Sling, and the devs who made the Sling wallet specifically wrote it to be hard to copy and so there has been a bug with our new wallet concerning masternodes for a while that was really hard to work around. But we were able to fix it. A thread re-design and a website are currently in discussion and we have the right people to make them happen. And ideas for a PR campaign are in mind and will be executed once we acquire some development momentum.
