I'll grant you that he probably is lying, and those who have invested a significant amount in alt coins are going to regret it when sidechain tech makes them obsolete.

What they know is that bitcoin is in a bear market at this time.  Many pro traders are calling it to bottom out around 7-8k, which is why you see so many buy orders lined up there.  Hodling is harder to do when the price is 10-20k per coin.

i mean, i hope you're right.  i'm less optimistic.  Alot of FUD spreading across the public about this fuckin scaling issue-- don't see a whole lot more growth until segwit's fully adopted.  I think more people will buy Ethereum until then, but they'll regret it when Lighting/Segwit is in full gear and RSK essentially renders Ethereum worthless.  Who knows how long that will take though.

the scaling FUD has successfully stunted btc's growth temporarily.  This is, ironically, good for bitcoin in the long-term.  If this is, indeed, our bottom for the foreseeable future (and i think it is), people will experience less fear in making future investments.  The unlikelihood  of bitcoin dropping below 10,000 will be comforting to many.

I mean, I'm definitely not rejecting bitcoin's increase in value.  I think to some degree, that is why we're all here.
I'm looking more long-term.  As bigger swaths of capital start investing, shorts will become a significant risk. 
I agree that the world needs a deflationary currency more, but bitcoin has the potential to become more than just a means of transaction.  If it can successfully decentralize global commerce, and therefore incentivize mass adoption (or the other way around, i guess), then the risk of a short would be much lower.

He's such a pussy.  I mean, I want to see the whole video and what let up to his frustration--but nothing was even being said that should trigger someone to that extent.  Why does he need to keep emphasizing that he is a millionaire? Why did he keep talking about bitcoin as if it is a business? He's a fucking insecure tool with no friends.
edit: just watched the whole interview, and stand by my initial comments (was drunk).  Roger was polite and reasonable for most of the interview, but once John began probing him about the intricacies Bcash (mining algorithm, number of coins, etc.) and his marketing tactics, he grew uncomfortable.   He then capitalized on John's use of the word "Bcash" to escape the interview.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:31:59
I'm not sure how much you are storing, but I recommend a hardware wallet that is segwit enabled.  I use Trezor and I have nothing but great things to say about them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:03:33
I mean, there are certainly bubbly aspects to it.  If enough people were fool enough to believe Roger Ver's talking points it definitely would have popped back when Segwit2X was cancelled.  But thankfully some of Bitcoin's best qualities are that it is democratized and decentralized.  For that reason I always tell people that if they are not going to do their homework and educate themselves about it, they are much better off saving their panic-sell money and watching from the sidelines.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:42:09

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:09

Get off of Coinbase/GDAX dude.  They're morally compromised and your money is not safe with them. 
Get a hardware wallet, keep your coin there, and use an exchange that has adopted Segwit so you can transfer your money quickly and at a low cost.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:04:13
Just read your post history.  My condolences about your situation.  Did Coinbase switch off your account while you were in the authentication process? Or did you already have money in there? 
Apologies if my comment came off as crass or dismissive of your post's context.  The exchange issue certainly has to be resolved, but I see them more as a symptom of wider adoption rather than of bitcoin itself. 
At the end of the day, exchanges end up becoming the trusted third parties that cryptocurrencies are trying to get rid of. 
There are other ways to acquire bitcoin that are, while less convenient, totally adhere to bitcoin's utility.  Last thing you probably want to hear right now, I am sure *gets off high horse*

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:51
I hate to say it, but I agree with you.  At the risk of sounding like a Bcash blowhard, I really think btc needs to reclaim its function as a practical means of transaction, in order to retain value of this magnitude.  
But it must maintain its integrity as a decentralized, autonomous, secure system.  This is non-negotiable.  
Technological enhancements like RSK and LN should assist with this tremendously, but how their implementation will correspond with btc's price remains to be seen.  
And volatility is a serious issue for merchants.  Excluding the aforementioned companies that believe in the technology, there's not much of a short-term financial incentive for others to accept bitcoin at this time.
On the other hand, the stock of companies that have chosen to adopt bitcoin has significantly increased.
I think we're close to mass adoption, but we have to prove that BTC is a practical means of transaction first.

The tech has intrinsic value.  Bitcoin's blockchain has first mover advantage and is one of the most secure.  When Segwit is adopted and Lightning Network gets into full gear, there won't be much stopping it.  It by no means is invincible, but is a pretty amazing feat of engineering.

I definitely see the logic behind it, i just think it grossly underestimates what gives bitcoin value.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:58
Really good points.  Bitcoin is fascinating because it appeals to so many different incentives.  At the moment it is getting most of its attention as an investment opportunity, but it also serves a variety of useful functions that we have yet to really take advantage of.  My hope is those will help incentivize adoption, despite the volatility, which is a totally valid concern.
While not at all surprising, it is worth noting that companies that have indicated adoption are reaping the benefits of bitcoin's value.  Perhaps companies will be willing to risk volatility due to FOMO, and spur a sort of positive feedback loop for bitcoin.

A significant chunk of this talk:
"It's not on your ISP bill-- it doesn't say 49.99 (but 10.00 discount -- the death of democracy discount -- 10 dollars off!!).  It doesn't say that.  You don't know that.  So you make the choice and gradually things change.  And you look back 10 years later and say, 'how the hell did we get here? How did our institutions die?'
We are not going to make the same mistake -- i hope -- with this system.  So we have a choice:
How do we scale while preserving the principles of decentralization, independence, privacy, security, autonomy, liberty in the base layer of these cryptocurrencies? 
The only way to do that is to move to additional layers.  We're going to move off-chain. Many of our transaction will not be settled on the base Bitcoin chain, or the base Ethereum chain.  They will happen in additional networks.  In engineering terms, you may have heard the terms Sidechain, or Lightning Network, or Drive Chain.  
These are all things that are going to allow us to do thousands, and then tens of thousands, and then millions, and then tens of millions, and then hundreds of billions of transactions a second-- Without all of them getting settled on the primary chain.
Only if we do it right.  Only if we preserve the principles of privacy, security, liberty, autonomy on the primary chain.  We have to get it right.  And that means making the primary chain slightly more expensive, slightly less scale-able."

You're getting trolled while asking a perfectly legit question--sorry about that. 
Bitcoin (and many other cryptocurrencies) is inherently valuable 
due to its functionality and the problems it can solve.  Its qualities of being border-less, highly secure, and (mostly) private give it value.  It is less functional as a currency at this moment, but that weakness has the potential to be resolved in the future.  We no longer need trusted third parties (governments, banks) to spend money.  That's huge.
An oversimplified response, but that's how I see it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:36:11
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:51:32
Bitcoin is valuable because it is useful by nature.  It performs valuable functions that fiat currencies cannot, and were never meant to.  At minimum, people like you believe in the tech--which is why they buy it.  In many cases, however, people all over the world have no choice to buy it because they are so poorly served by the institutions that have evolved to manipulate our civilization.  No matter what price it is, Bitcoin is an inherently useful store of value/means of transaction.  As long as there's an internet connection, people will continue to use it.

I appreciate this post because *power consumption is one of the concrete obstacles that lies in the face of bitcoin's infrastructure.  
Calling it the "death of bitcoin," however sounds like hyperbolic Roger-Jihad FUD bot speak to me.  So yeah, kindly fuck off with that shit please.  
Renewable energy production is a make-or-break issue that confronts our entire civilization--not just bitcoin.  
In the countries that consume the most energy, renewable tech and adoption seems to be on an exponential rise.  If we can keep that trend going, it is a cause of some optimism for our world and bitcoin.

While I definitely see what you're saying, I would understand why someone would label your response as FUD.  There are tons of people in the bitcoin community who are all for increasing the block size, which again, is one of the strengths of bitcoin: it can be altered in a democratic fashion to suit everyone's needs.  There is no reason to believe that bitcoin is going to remain nothing but a store of value forever, as many transactions still happen.  The fees and wait times suck, sure, but at least they have the potential of improving.

A sticky devoted to the upcoming upgrades and how they will address the transaction issue is a great idea.
I have mixed feelings about restricting new accounts from posting.  On the one hand, I think doing so could be a great defense against BCH shills and Roger Clones as they try to jizz their shit all over the place.  
On the other hand, what makes bitcoin (and normally, this sub) so great is its lack of censorship.
Great post.

It is possible for there to be a significant dip in the future, but then again, maybe it won't.
If I were you, I would buy sooner rather than later.  When the upgrades like Lightning and RSK go into motion BTC's value is likely to increase significantly.

As someone who despises religion (and the hypocrisy of American Christianity specifically), I'd say 95% is a bit of an oversimplification.  I know a lot of good pastors who are simultaneously critical of their faith/church/whatever, but see their occupation as a genuinely effective way of serving their communities.  I think Unitarian Pastors are particularly good finding this sweet spot, but that's besides the point.  Because I think what you're pointing at is mostly correct, especially when it comes to the more dogmatic/fear-based faiths (Catholicism, Evangelism, etc.).  
Just a master/slave morality just put in the context of the false promise of an afterlife.  It's disgusts me that humanity still allows itself to be manipulated in this way.  Props to this asshole's family for hodling.

You are completely misrepresenting the opposition to Segwit2x.  You actually think that we would never support a hard fork under any given set of circumstances? 
We simply agree with Satoshi; hard forks are not to be implemented unless the vast majority of users support them. 
If Segwit2x weren't a totally haphazard ejaculation of code and protocol, I (and many others) would totally support increasing the block size.  Its current state is unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:23:11
Wise words.  We need to remain focused on what actually makes bitcoin valuable (and necessary) rather than get so stoked on how it relates to the dollar, which is losing value.

I really don't understand the hype around this guy either.  He seems to just advocate principles that intelligent conservatives/libertarians gravitate towards (free market economics, personal responsibility, free will, etc.) He is quite charismatic and seems to have accomplished much as a psychologist, but the foundation of his main philosophical/political arguments lack substance and are often self-contradictory.  He sympathizes with the alt right in a totally hypocritical, if not downright sinister, way.  
Tbh I am pretty surprised he is turning to bitcoin.  But who cares.
