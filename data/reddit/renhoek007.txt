Not necessarily.  Not much ‘new money’ left. Any retail (ie hodl) investor who would have ever invested in bitcoin has done so already.  Seems most volume now is trading bots.
Now the general public is more cautious about getting burned than fomo.
The only way we can turn this around is a fundamental change/update in the way bitcoin is used.  And i’m afraid thats a long time away... :/  (ie years rather than months)
Ps:  i still own some bitcoin. Saying this because its what i honestly think, not because i’m trying to “fud” or whatever.

Bitcoin private (BTCP) is a fork of bitcoin that will also benefit.  Snapshot happened a couple of weeks ago. If you had BTC with private keys then, you should be able to claim them now. Worth about $50 atm

It can take ages sometimes. Their exchange has some kind of withdraw/deposit queue which can get congested. Check out their forum (much better than their non existant customer support) for up to date info.
I’ve had deposits like yours waiting for hours before. I recommend waiting another 12 hours before paniking. It’ll probs be in yr account by then.
I never use cryptopia anymore due to this exact issue. The stress of having your funds dissapear for long periods of time sucks balls : (

This is exactly my point.  There's no new money coming into the market, only bots trading sideways.  The symptom of this is that it does not move upwards with good news (as it should).  It only moves down when bad things happen (and bot owners pull their money out)
So as you've just pointed out, until the market starts reacting to good news there's only one way this can go in the short term.  Sadly its further down : (
would really like to be wrong...

I’ve just come back from a deep neural net conerence. AI everywhere right now. So it can drive a car? Bet your ass someone has it trading bitcoin too. Bots you call them.  Personally i think its mainly neural net bots moving btc price in random ways right now, squeezing money out of the market by wild manipulation and tricks.  Sadly its seems most of the market atm. The only thing which attributed to the big rise last year was so many fomo chumps entering the market.  The chumps are now gone, uninterested and burned.  Without a big paradigm shift in tech i dont see them coming back.  And thats years away at best...  so i cant see a turnaround anytime soon. And taking it one step further, if we’re this shakey on no news, what happens when some bad news comes out?  I think another tank is far more likely than another moon at this point.
I still own bitcoin so not trying to ‘fud’ or whatever. Just speaking my honest mind.
