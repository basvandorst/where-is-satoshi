So wait, can i transfer out to an external wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:00:34
Big money got into BTC when they realized its potential as a store of value, so i would say very recently (hence all the noobs getting robbed of 100k+)

Many exchanges give you an option to “repeat this buy” and choose “day, week, month”
I know Coinbase does this and I thinks friend uses an exchange that allows it. Not sure if the name tho...
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:13:08
Because Coinbase/gdax aren’t segwit-compatible 
-edit: forgot to say thank you a bunch!
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:09:48
Wait... seriously? :') You seriously have no clue how much this means to me. I have always smiled at the stories on here of people helping each-other out on this sub but never dreamed of being the recipient of someone else's generosity. 
Thank you so much stranger. With the news that Capitol one is no longer allowing me to buy crypto (tested and sadly confirmed) this was a huge lift to my spirits!

@_date: 2018-01-21 05:24:36
I am
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:20:38
Congratulations friend. I was looking at bitcoin for years with no expendable income do put down. I watched it climb to 1000, fall, 4000, fall, etc. until I finally saved enough to get 50$ (That’s a lot when you live paycheck to paycheck) in at 7k. I have since bought a little here and there when I can and even doubled .01 BTC to .02 daytrading. I am excited to hear you take time out of your day to help New people. I do the same and the more of us out there speaking the truth the less power the people hoping to smear bitcoins name have. I hope one day others will realize the enormous power (and responsibility) that being your own bank carries. 
Anyway, I’m blabbing now but I guess what I am saying is keep doing the good fight by informing others and fighting FUD when you see it spreading. Bitcoin has the power to change the world but it can’t do it alone! It needs all of us lifting together to help it grow.

Newcomer to conversation, I agree with this. We should not be downvoting or shunning people because they are trying to inform themselves. If this is one of the first places they come for help, and we just troll and scream at them, that can leave a very bad taste in someone’s mouth. Next thing u know they are badmouthing bitcoin and hurting the movement. 
Edit: as far as Coinbase being dickheads, saying this field has EXPLODED is an understatement. They are understaffed and trying to catch up
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:27
Oh my lord dude! Give it a rest! I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER as to why they would be  “splitting of the pie” as u call it. I do not work for them, I’m not trying to get referrals, I have already acknowledged that I have no proof of what is going on behind my computer screen. I  am new to it and thought i would make a post to discuss it. Leave me the hell alone dude.

Welcome to the world of bitcoin! Unfortunately you joined at a very busy time and there is a huge backlog of transactions awaiting confirmation.

1. I have made my money back and then some before turning on the reinvest feature so I don’t see that as an issue.
2. I hope this is incorrect. Hashflare has been around for years and has good reviews from what I have seen.
3. Already addressed I can not prove this but I am receiving daily payouts without problems in BTC so I’m happy
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:10:38
OMG THIS THIS THIS
There is no mining and THAT ALONE should hint you off that someone else (the parent Corp) is reaping all the TX fees. I do have some ripple but I’m  on it for the hype train ride. Been pumping and dumping it and have so far increased my .0041 btc into ~ .015. Ready to dump this shitcoin once it hits 3$
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:09:43
literally read this as i thought it
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:13:46
I see where you are coming from, saying that they would be better off mining it themselves. But their parent company (Hashcoins) is one of the largest SHA-256 hardware producers in Europe, which is why they are the largest SHA-256 cloud mining co around. Genesis runs out of SHA contracts before they turn on the miners, where hashflare claims to constantly expand the amount of SHA hash with each new contract. They have provided photos of their SCRYPT and DASH setups. When asked why not showing their SHA setup they say that due to constantly adding more racks, their SHA warehouse is constantly a mess and not photo ready. 
My point of view is that they are backed by the largest supplier of SHA hash in Europe, have their address listed, and give you an online tour of their home office. They opened in 2013 and have had no major outages or scandals, so I plan on sticking with them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:42
Agreed. Guy is excited and made a joke. People on this sub need to relax.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:52:45

Shouldn't hate on alt-coins in general man, Just BCASH because they have malicious intent
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:57:03
Can someone famous please call me poor? Thanks ^^/s
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:36
Exactly, and here is the hardest part of being a BTC supporter at the moment;
We all want to defend our first love, Bitcoin, but if we bash on BCASH we are in turn attacking their coin, stooping to their level. 
I personally **hate** that I feel I need to tell people to avoid BCASH because part of what i tell friends is diversify your wallet! I think all alt-coins should have equal opportunity to flourish and any coin that tries to hinder that should be burned at the stake.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:28:54
Whats with people attacking newcomers here? Who is to say the advice isn't for me? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:51:41
So a lot of people on here are hating on cloud mining, but im gonna say this anyway. Well done and congrats, i too have contracts with them and love it. As for advice, i personally say make your ROI first, then turn on reivest for 2 weeks, turn off for 2 weeks, and continue that cycle. This will keep your year end at almost the same level (as difficulty increases your daily payouts will decrease) as it was at your original time of investing. Next time, head on over to r/hashflare, wont get as many mean spirited people ripping you for choosing what to do with YOUR money. (Seriously guys, he is excited, why the hate? ^that ^was ^rhetorical )
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:47:11
To address your questions in order:
1. I know difficulty will increase and decrease my daily payouts. I have compensated by reinvesting to the point wher my year end significantly higher than my actual goal.
2. Simplest and most honest answer is I hope you are wrong. I am very aware that cloud mining companies have a history of this. However, most of thise were individual startups not backed by a large company like hashflare (Hashcoins)
3. Dood. C’mon, I’ve had this account since before hashflare even existed. Relax.
4. I am willing to bet that the payouts they are giving me and then taking 15% out of are not 100% of the coin mined from my hash. They keep 20% or so off the rip, **THEN** give it to me and take another 15%. I don’t understand how this business model doesn’t make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:56:24
Be sure you trust this person. And congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:21:27

Saving. Thanks so much
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:53:48
That’s a dope ass idea
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:31:01
I think its a good idea to diversify your wallet, but dumping all of one to buy another seems foolish to me. Simply movimg all your eggs from basket to basket
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:52:32
So if you read  above I state that I am confident the payouts they show me are not 100% of the coin my hash earned that day. Using the numbers from  above. Let’s assume they take 20%off the top, then show me my $2.70 payout and taking 15%.
 
So if 2.70= N x (.8) than N=3.375 
We will keep the extra decimal since this is actually BTC we are talking about, and not USD
3.375-2.70= .675
You have already found that their 15% of my 2.70 is .47 per day. This added to the newly found .675 is $1.145/day
1.145 x 365 = $417 in the year. 
If I am making 865.5 than we can do:
Of which their 417 is 32.5% of the total net worth of the account. When put this way does it really seem that unbelievable that they are still crazy profiting? 
~~Please understand I mean none of this in a harrassing or mean spirited manner. I enjoy the intellectual conversation that my friends see and hear as hieroglyphs haha~~ Fuck off  
Edit: Forgot to include most financial advising firms only charge you 1-5% to take, play with, and grow your money ( and they don’t make NEARLY as much profit as a bitcoin will). They ARE making out like thieves, I promise.

I will have to look into him! I have a hashflare account and also am making a pretty penny off it (no where NEAR your numbers haha) and couldn’t be happier. I reinvest my referral bonuses for more hash and hopefully I will have almost .1 BTC by this time next year :) with difficulty increases probably a little less but still!
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:40:45
Their parent company (Hashcoins) is one of the largest producers of SHA equipment in Europe, so they are getting their mining equipment for below even wholesale prices. Not a very large percentage of BTC holders are interested in mining, meaning the demand is a niche market. This allows their parent company to still make a profit off miners instead of having them sit in backstock.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:20:49

This is important because not only should people know that they can buy alt-coins, but it can help stop them from getting tricked into buying "fake-bitcoins"
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:59:13
Wow! Lucky you! I am one of those guys who opened a wallet at 400$... and never bought any. Got an appt, still followed bitcoin, ignore it for 3 months and it explodes haha oh well! Not stressing about it.  Advised my buddy to buy cryptos and he made about 7x his investment.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:19:24
 I bought 120$ in 1 year contracts over the course of a week or so. I revive a payout of around .00025 BTC (~$2.70) a day. 
 After 60 days (a tad less actually cuz I made some money off referrals) I broke even and then some so I withdrew it to my wallet. 
Since then I have been taking my daily payouts and using them to buy more hashrate and recently reached a point where this time next year I will have .1 BTC to withdraw to my wallet.   Edit* this was taken a week or so ago 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:59:37

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:25:19
This is likely due to increased traffi. Coinbase had fees of like 11 USD when it hit 10k and people flooded
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:41:44
Thank you for providing more of an explanation, I really do appreciate it! I am currently invested $120 and made 160 and withdrew. Now I am projected to have minimum .1 btc thanks to reinvesting payouts and referrals. I understand that they are the only ones who charge you to withdraw but they also have the lowest maintenance fees, which I think is a fair trade off. I also was too late for this years genesis SHA-256 contracts (totally slipped my mind) and will have to look into hashing24 for sure!

This guy gets it. Plan on the money gyou put in being gone for a decade at least. And also be prepared to lose every penny, I say that meaning don’t put your life’s savings into bitcoin. This is New and exciting technology and I DO believe bitcoin is the future and will be worth $100k at some point... but you never know. Long story short, kiss your money goodbye when you put it in there. And tell yourself “it’s gone, maybe someday I will get it back” 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:37:07
Damn! You mean I missed it??

Haven’t sold anything on eBay yet, (bought plenty haha) that’s part of why I am here first! Mostly sell them to friends and in local mineral auctions but I went on a bit of a buying spree this year haha. Gimme a few mins and I will link an imgur album of just a glimpse. If you see anything you like just let me know!.................. edit: here is a brief look 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:48:50
I have a .001 BTC bet with my buddy it will be 10k by December 2nd (made back in September). Texted him my wallet address this morning just be a dick haha
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:35:32
Haha good! More miners means more decentralization! Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:02:51
That’s a good guy right there! Both of you! Taking your time to help a total stranger on the internet, while (realistically) expecting nothing out of it shows your character. Clearly this person recognized that, and returned the respect by fulfilling his/her word. As someone who isn’t new to the community, but has a low BTC balance due to financial hardship, it really warms my heart knowing that this community can still rely on each other when we fall. You and this individual (user of BCH or not) clearly embody what bitcoin hopes to bring out in all that use it; Trust.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:02:24
Got to get some money to start accumulating more BTC. Haha it’s funny how the main thing I want cash for is to convert it to the thing that one day may kill cash
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:17:51
I have always said 300k
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:35:34
I bought at 7500 and couldn’t be happier. Believe, hodl, and keep buying!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:23:30
I always set my monthly buying goals in BTC, not USD because of this
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:17:18

I am loving all the people on here who honestly think you were asking
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:42:57
No one on this page is more aware of the seriousness of the issue than me. Was simply saying hodl &gt; sustainance 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:31:44
25 and I only have about 50$ in BTC and unfortunately do not have the funds to get more in the near future ( injured and can’t work :/)....... but damn me if I have a penny to my name I will hodl over withdraw!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:39:28
But why?
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:07:12
I have a similar deal with hashflare and yeas, it is nice. But what others on here are getting at is this: if you bought a 700$ contract a year ago, you would make money for sure, maybe even get a whole .5-.75 BTC or around 5k. Sounds awesome yes, but if you had spent that on just buying bitcoin, you would have 8k right now. These sites DO offer great returns on your money, but you and I both know that bitcoin has been growing very rapidly and is arguably a better investment.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:16:57
So a lot of people here are referring you to other resources, and they are correct! If you are going to throw your money into any investment, you want to know what you are getting into. 
But as I am guessing you are looking for a short discussion or synopsis I can hopefully help! 
As bitcoin is so very complicated and has many aspects to cover, I would honestly encourage you to ask me (and whoever else cares to answer) questions! 
So allow me to ask you, what would you like to know?! ........................edit: this book is online for free. It gets *veryyyy* technical very quickly, but the **first 2 chapters** are a ferric general explanation
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:22:05
That’s awesome man, glad to hear it! See that is the difference between hashflare and genesis. Hashflare you make a larger return but the contracts are one year long. I wasn’t aware that genesis is a lifetime deal. I will have to look into that! Is it a one time payment? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:05:45
I got far too hyped for 1am watching this.

@_date: 2017-11-27 17:22:20
Once it hits my goal of 300,000, I will probably sell half and keep half just in case this whole “fourth economic revolution” thing happens.  Don’t want to cash out just to have to convert everything back to bitcoin when it takes over!

@_date: 2017-11-25 00:38:23
Thats why I buy 51.99 at a time. Ensures I get a full 50 worth of BTC, and one cent more you get the 2.99 fee

Helping the bitcoin community will be helping me in the long run amigo ;) I’m going to interviews and hopefully something happens quick!
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:22:56
I do plan on purchasing actual BTC after this fork. As far as how technically inclined I am, I would be looking to do something very similar to your setup. How would I go about setting up my private key?

Hydro-flask?... and we just say water bottle like fucking barbarians
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:32:07
What they are saying is yes, bitcoin mining will *probably* make you some money, but if you bought 20k worth of bitcoins, you would make EASILY 5x what you would mining for a few years. Also cloud mining will again, increase your dollars, but even less so that mining. Buy a TREZOR wallet from the trezor website and buy 2.5 bitcoins

I would say your best bet is to log into the email you were using at the time and search “BTC” “bitcoin” , “bitcoinqt” or the name of the equipment you were using if you needed an email to register it to the network. Really hope someone can help you figure this out. That’s a lot of bitcoin to have sitting there! Just remember not all of us can be so lucky! As much as we all joke around on this subbreddit, If you do get your hands on it be sure you use the money on things that will actually help you move up in the world as oppose to stupid shit like lambo’s and blow. Know a few people who hit big money and lost it all so just trying to look out

@_date: 2017-11-13 04:17:15
simply put they are the ones who verify transactions and use their electricity, internet, and dedicate computing power to the bitcoin network.

As if I haven’t been following the price like a hawk! ;) Haha glad to hear it all worked out!  Been following bitcoin for a long while now but am still in the baby leagues with my 50$ investment. But I made my first dollar profit so I got that going for me! I hope you have a good weekend stranger, and appreciate the gift that hopefully will help you achieve your dreams. Not all of us can be so lucky, so live it up for me!
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:39:38

@_date: 2017-11-03 22:55:50
It’s a website where you pay to help some pay the bills associated with their VERY large BTC mining operation. In return, you get a small portion of the bitcoin generated. I would reccome d looking into it. It’s a good option if you don’t have a lot of money to throw into it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:30:18
I would say the same. The money he gave you most likely was created out of thin air at the fork, so I doubt he will even feel that
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:22:15
Took the words right out of my mouth!

@_date: 2018-03-24 05:28:03
Seeing as how they are a company they probably could use the money, so I would reccomend liquidating 70-85% of it depending how large of a contribution this was and how badly they need the money (don’t tell us).
As for how to sell and convert it to cash, many people here are saying to go through a financial/liquidity provider which if this is a HUGE amount I agree with.
