Sounds like to me you got in for the wrong reasons. If you thought of BTC as a way to get rich one day then you don't believe in BTC, you believe in what you heard about BTC. Given the recent jump in popularity, there is a lot of noise out there that is just wrong. Will BTC be worth 1 million USD per BTC. Most likely not. That would be insane. At that point, the bitcoin market cap would be 1.68*10^13 or 16,800,000,000,000. That is almost 17 trillion dollars. The ENTIRE United States market is worth 27.3 trillion to put that in perspective.
In order to have faith and feel secure in HODLing, you need to understand the technology behind BTC. Understand the blockchain, how mining works, difficulty, transaction fees and why they exist, who gets them, the mining reward, how more BTC is released to the public, understand segwit, understand the lightning network, understand how your FIAT currency works in your country. Understand how banks work and what the blind trust is you put in a bank to hold your money. Understand the politics of why countries are worried about it and potentially want to ban it. Once you read up on all that and get a better understanding of what Bitcoin is and it's current implications on the world, ask yourself one question. "Do I think BTC could truly become an ALTERNATIVE for FIAT currency?". If yes, then only invest what you can afford to lose. Set up sell orders for the absolute bottom dollar you can take in order to keep yourself from losing it all if BTC were to crash
 (Keep in mind this would mean leaving your money on an exchange which is a big no-no.). Have an exit plan.  Otherwise, you're better off taking your money and putting it in something like a ROTH IRA to save for retirement.

Maybe its an exchange wallet receiving BTC from people selling? I would say that it is bad business practice to not generate a new address for each transaction though. Coinbase for example has quite exuberant fees for selling to them even after this drop in fees.

Yeah, I was lied to. I am probably never going back to blockchain again except to see when blocks are mined. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:00:58
I am interested to see how the next difficulty adjustment will impact the fees. It was a blessing that it came through and cleared the blockchain a good amount though. What I hate is that exchanges are still assigning high txn fees on people buying BTC and moving their coin off the exchange. They really could benefit from batching with SegWit. Looking at you Coinbase...
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:04:52
Play it by ear. Watch the price and dont invest more than you can lose. A common strategy by traders is that they set up sell orders at a price where they cannot afford to lose anymore. Say you have $100 USD in BTC right now, but you can't afford for that value to drop to anything less than $60. Set a sell order for whatever the BTC price would be to meet that $60 requirement.  
Personally, I don't see it falling below 9K as far as I can tell. The support level at 9K is still too large to fall at this point unless there was some serious sell pressure. I am talking offloading of ~30-35 million in BTC being sold off. Currently BTC is showing a bearish trend meaning it is likely the price will continue to fall but in the short term, expect a small rally probably back up into the 11K area. The RSI is showing that BTC is almost in a state of being Oversold. If BTC cannot get back up to 11K by the end of the day, then I would say pullback is likely. If it closes above 13K for whatever reason, well the bull will be in the china shop.

How do I determine the size of my transaction? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:03:57
I think people are really on this SegWit train for being the reason because it seems to be mentioned in a large amount of posts about it around here. However, I think you hit the nail on the head with the comment about how hashpower has rised and blocks are being mined faster with a mix of lower usage. Segwit has had an impact, but that impact is quite small. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:54:44
1.) Outlier Segwit Usage  
I think you are taking my statement out of context. I truly believe that Segwit is an answer to the congestion and scaling problem we saw. What I am saying is that Segwit adoption is not a large reason the blockchain is lowering in unconfirmed transactions or bringing the fees down RECENTLY. [Segwit Adoption]( peaked around 12.8% and has recently fallen backdown to 10%. It has consistently ranged in the 8-10% range. If 2% more adoption was the difference between 300+sat/byte transactions and the low sat/byte we are seeing now, then I would be VERY surprised.  
  
2.) Rise in Hashpower  
 [The Hash Rate]( has gone up from 15.5 TH/s on January 7th, to peaking at 20.7 TH/s on January 20th. Thus, the average block is mined in [7.26 minutes]( where as it was around the high 8s before. Being conservative we will say mid 8 minute marks. This would mean that currently the 7.26 minute average allows for 198 blocks to be mined in a day. At 8.5 minutes that allows for 169 blocks to mined in a day. That is a ~29 block difference. Looking at recent transaction counts included in blocks, we will say 1400 transactions are included in a block. That is 40,500 TRANSACTIONS MORE IN A DAY with a 7.26 minute average compared to an 8.5 minute average. Even if you lower the average time for a block to be mined before the hashrate spike to 8 minutes, the hashrate spike still would allow for 25,686 more transactions in a day. While Difficulty has adjusted, it has only increased 15.4% between the 2 dates mentioned above, while hashrate increased 33.5% in the 2 dates mentioned above. 
  
3.)  Lower usage  
Furthermore, if you look at [the confirmed transaction in a day]( you will see that as of recently the total number of confirmed transaction is lower than the spike we saw with this price spike to 18K we saw in early December. Knowing this coupled with the fact there are [less unconfirmed transactions in the mempool]( leads us to only one conclusion. This simply means less people are using the blockchain currently.  
  
So next time you decide you want to be all knowing and talk down on someone, check yourself before you wreck yourself.

I wonder why there is such a large discrepancy between Blockchain and JoHoe
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:30:59
Please do not take this as proof the price will increase to *insert number* here. While this seems all scientific and probability based, the method is still flawed. This essentially takes a look at the daily percent change, and then randomly applied that against the price in a recursive manner. Furthermore, the daily change is based off a year where there was ENORMOUS growth which would then make it so most data shows growth... which it did. To be more fair, this should have gone back a few years at least.  
  
TLDR: If this was a practical way of determining price, anyone could use this to make a fuck ton of money. It does not work that way.

Well we saw with China there was a pretty solid dip. Around ~30%. The price was able to get back up rather quick though. I just worry because the US being such a world leader. If the US bans it, other countries might feel the need to follow suit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:15:05
1.) I recommend electrum for a wallet that will be on your computer. If you want a hardware wallet you will have to spend money on a trezor or another kind of hardware wallet.  
2.) Some wallets will support multiple currencies, but the one I recommended is only BTC. In order to sell BTC you would have to move it from your wallet to an exchange wallet and then sell.  
3.) You do not own the wallet on an exchange. There has been 1 hack of an exchange that anyone that had BTC on the exchange wallet was lost. Always get your BTC off of an exchange as soon as you can.  
4.) Not that I know of. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:45
Just be patient. The lack of patience by users is a problem. If you're  day trading trying to make profit off margins, then the high fees will end you unless you are working in large volume of BTC. In the meantime, understand that you wont have your money move from wallet to wallet in 10 minutes like before this massive influx of users unless you are willing to pay a high fee. Even if your transaction gets mined in the next 150 blocks it will be there by tomorrow. That is still MUCH faster than I can transfer money from my bank account to someone else and it clear the ACH. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:34
You know... there might be some actual weight. I was talking to some of my buddies in Canada about the United States and they said the Canadian government is just sort of pretending Trump doesn't exist. His direct quote was, "The US is broken right now. We will check back in a couple years."

Thank you. :) I've spent a lot of time reading about Bitcoin and how it works. u/weopre seems to think it's misinformation but didn't provide any proof that what I said was wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:18:43
So you're not wrong... but there is more to it than just supply and demand. It's really more about the limit of the 1MB block size (please note I did not support Segwit2x). Back on December 7th when the BTC price began to skyrocket more and more people were getting into BTC than ever. Thus, more and transactions were posted to the mempool. Transactions are selected from the mempool and put into a block that is added to a blockchain dependent on the fee associated with the transactions. This means that people who wanted their BTC on the very next block had to add these exuberant fees in order to ensure the quick completion. Imagine a faucet that is pouring out water into a sink. Now imagine that sink has a small drain in it. The water begins to rise because water cannot drain faster than it is being added. That is the issue with the blockchain currently. Now that is not a perfect metaphor, but on December 7th, we peaked at 184,000 unconfirmed transactions. Currently the blockchain is sitting at 100,000 unconfirmed transactions with the lowest since December 7th being 70,000 unconfirmed transactions. However, even with the new rush of users that is still not the highest number of unconfirmed transactions the blockchain has seen.  
  
Essentially, people need to learn to be more patient with their transactions. People need to accept that getting into the very next block on the blockchain is not needed. For example, when I purchase something with my Credit Card, the money is not put into the vendors account within 10 minutes. It takes a couple days for the transaction to clear. This "pending" or "temporary authorization" is sort of like the mempool. The transaction has been posted and it can be seen, but it is not finalized. If people lowered their fees the transactions just take a little longer to finalize instead of being finalized in 10 minutes or when the very next block is mined. Now if there is an emergency and you need to get the BTC to someone QUICKLY this is when you post a high fee transaction in order to ensure the BTC is finalized and in the wallet of the receiver quickly.  
  
The reason for high fees right now is either from a lack of user knowledge about how the mempool and how the blockchain works (Most likely because of a lot of new users), a lack of patience in finalizing transactions, or the transactions are extremely time dependent on being done quickly (the least likely).  
  
According to [Bitcoinfees]( a website that will let you know how many unconfirmed vs confirmed transactions given a certain fee in terms of per byte, you could post a fee of $3.92 USD and the transaction is estimated to be included on the blockchain as early as 5 blocks. 5 blocks with the current mining rate of blocks being 8.45 minutes per block is 42 minutes. Now it could take longer. It could 200 blocks to be included. That would be 28 hours. STILL FASTER THAN A CREDIT CARD CAN CLEAR.

I bought at 3,500, 4100, 4800, and 5300. Haven't had any extra money to invest in a bit due to the holidays, student loans, bills, just life stuff. If it dips to 3K, I will cry at the money I have lost, then use that as motivation to buy some more BTC and get ready for the ride again. However, I do not think that BTC will ever fall that low again unless there is another Mt. Gox with a company like Gemini or Coinbase, the Blockchain stops working, or the United States government steps in and bans it (this would probably have a smaller drop than the reasons listed before).
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:46:36
Agreed. We need some sort of fix to this soon. Hopefully the lightning network offers the support the block chain needs with the 1MB blocksize right now.

If it helps, I am here because I believe in BTC to succeed. A solution to the fees are needed, but at this point in the game I have such a small amount invested relatively that id rather the ride drop and potentially buy some more. I think once the price drops enough we will see a drop in use, and the mempool with slowly catch up. It will give BTC a chance to solve its scaling issues, and once that happens people will come back.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:11:56

I need to learn more about this lightning network. I was listening to a podcast with Charlie Lee as a guest and they touch on the lightning network but did not got into the detail I was hoping for. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:49:30
That question is dependent upon how quickly you need the transaction to be moved from the mempool to the blockchain, or how fast the transaction needs to be on the blockchain ledger. The higher the fee the faster it will be mined onto the blockchain. If I needed to send my mom $100 right now and I decided to do it in Bitcoin, but she is okay with it being in her wallet by 6pm tonight, and it is currently almost 3pm where I am. Currently the blockchain is averaging 8.43 minutes per block. This means between now and 6pm there will be roughly 21 blocks mined that my transaction could go on. Thus, I could probably put a $1.50 fee on the transaction and it would be in her wallet by 6pm at the latest. If I needed to get a transaction through instantly, or on the very next mined block, it would be around $4. This would mean the money would be in her wallet and usable after about 8.23 minutes or whenever the next block is mined.  
  
However, the $4 fee is also during a time right now where Bitcoin price has skyrocketed so A LOT of transactions are occurring right now. During a time in which BTC is relatively stable (respective to BTC volatility) the fee could be as low as $1 to be included in the next block.  Currently BTC is working on a way to lower these fees even more so that you would be able to send a transaction for $0.25 that would be included in the next few blocks. If you are interested at all in this check out the lightning network solution that has shown some promise.

So far it appears that their mining department (dont know if it is called a department) have not been effected by the China Ban. The ban is more of a temporary halt to the exchange of Yen to BTC, and then on Oct 30th there will be a halt on BTC to Yen exchanges.
As for what the Chinese government wants to actually do with BTC as currency so far is unknown. However, all signs point to some sort of regulation, which wont happen.

We saw after the announcement of the ban that a large majority of the Chinese with BTC dumped it off. China went from trading 30% of BTC down to the low 3-7% area depending on the hour. There are some that most likely still have theirs, but if they dont sell in this huge up tick I would be surprised.
Will there be a price drop on the 30th/Early Oct? Most likely there will be. Will it be down a lot? Hard to say but my guess it is unlikely that the price drops below $3K USD again due to this event. I would not be surprised to see the ~$3400 USD range again, but this all speculation. No one knows for sure.
I will come in a buy more BTC as the price drops on the 30th or early october but the dip might not be as big as some people were originally thinking.

Bruh, if BTC is 100K USD then according to recent reports you would need 30 BTC at 65 years old to live for 20 years. So I would only imagine how you would need 3 times that if you retired in your mid 20s. 90 BTC. If you have that much, you did BTC right.

Most BTC is out of China already. On the 30th, Chinese just cant buy more BTC using Yuan. However, on the 30th of October they will also be stopping the exchange of BTC to Yuan. However, BTCC has stated so far that their mining department is unaffected by the "ban". Signs are pointing that this BTC ban is not a ban and more of a temporary halt until China is able to find a way to combat fraud using BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:02:45
Not saying that alts coins aren't good. I think that LTC, ETH, and Monero are some solid coins, just dont personally buy them up. Reason being is they carry extra risk that BTC itself does not have, and damn is BTC an already extremely thing to put money in. When the BTC price falls, the altcoins follow suit. When BTC rises, it seems the alt coins follow suit. Yeah they have their moments where rise and fall without BTC, but more often than not it feels like those moments are falls.  
  
I believe in BTC for the idea of decentralized currency that allows me to exchange money to whoever I want where ever I want. Become your own bank. I could go on. It has been amazing to see the increase in Segwit adoption, and the development of the Lightning Network come to fruition. This crash honestly will help weed out the people who are here because they thought they could make a quick buck, and those that truly believe in what BTC and many other cryptos stand for. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:44:32
It seems an easy method is an Electrum wallet that will keep your BTC stored behind a 12 word pass phrase that as long as you can recall can access your BTC. Some people recommend using TailsOS in order to create an electrum wallet on a flash drive. This creates a flashdrive that essentially has all your BTC on it that can be accessed by just plugging a flash drive and booting into TailsOS.

I got in right now. Saw it hit the 3350 area and stay there for a bit. However here is my opinion.  
Say you have $500 that you are willing to point. Right now while you know it crashed, put in $100 or so. Wait till the morning hits when Beijing is a live and well, see the price if it dropped lower, throw another $100 in. Keep doing this til BTC either really start to rebound and all in what is left, or keep adding $100 over the length of the crash. Yes there is some risk and guessing involved, but in all honesty, only put in what you could afford to lose. For me today it was $115. Maybe tomorrow ill throw in another $100.

My girlfriend is doing the same thing. She buys like $30 worth of BTC when she can, and just hopes that its worth a lot. She knows she probably wont be able to get enough in it to pay it all off, but if she can turn $30 a month worth of BTC over the next 4 years into more, then good on her. Ill just be here HODLing until I am finally able to go to a store and buy some coffee with BTC. Then I will probably use it all the time.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:17:10
You are correct. This is the exact reason I only put in $115 USD currently. Tomorrow, if it tanks more, I have more that I will likely invest. Right now, the price fell enough for me to put in that $115 and forget about it. If I lose it, so be it. However, I want to see how the Chinese react tomorrow morning when they find out because like you said, all signs point to selling and selling hard. 
I truly believe BTC can hit the 10K USD to 1 BTC range, but it will have to go through some tough moment where governments try to control/regulate it. Banks want to be able to use their own blockchains to control their own amount of the cryptocurrency but can't because it is not regulated.

Nothing wrong with that if you feel other coins are the way to go. However, that is going to come down to opinion and some analysis of the currency. I have followed BTC and ETH the most, and when I saw ETH make its jump from being $15 to the $300 mark I took some more interest.
In my opinion, BTC and ETH are the only 2 worth really investing money in right now. Read up on ETH because it is super interesting in its own ways and maybe consider picking up 1 ETH and seeing how it does. The big jumps will continue to be in BTC for the time being though. (All an opinion based off the little research I have time to do)

It is nice to see that of the people in this thread its only every 1 out of 10 that dont believe in BTC. I am seeing more people who have more interest to get in and learn about it more than those who are here to say "FRAUD!" and "BUBBLE!". The blockchain is an amazing concept. So much so that major businesses such as Deloite, Amazon, J.P. Morgan, and more are starting to HIRE FULL TIME POSITIONS THAT PAY GOOD MONEY for just having high level knowledge of the block chain. These companies are interested in not only the blockchain but BTC as well because BTC is showing to be a sound foundation for the technology. We live in the digital area. Technology is ever evolving. If you honestly think a digital concurrency is not going to catch on in the next 10 years or so I believe you are mistaken. A prime example is the number of people who their debit card for every transaction they make. VERY rarely do you see someone use cash anymore. I know BTC has a long way to go before it becomes capable of being a daily used currency, but as of right now the functionality is solid.

Could you give me more information on how to do this? I appreciate the quick guide, but as someone who has never used TailsOS I am a little worried I will mess up and lose my BTC. Currently, I just hodl in Coinbase, but I am hearing not only is this bad from a safety point of view, but that coinbase can be dicks about letting you get your BTC to USD and into an account. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:41:17

Dont use coinbase. They support the hardfork, overcharge for BTC, and have CRAZY fees. Try GDAX (the exchange coinbase uses to get your BTC to you) or Gemini.

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:10:29
I got in right now. Saw it hit the 3350 area and stay there for a bit. However here is my opinion.  
Say you have $500 that you are willing to point. Right now while you know it crashed, put in $100 or so. Wait till the morning hits when Beijing is a live and well, see the price if it dropped lower, throw another $100 in. Keep doing this til BTC either really start to rebound and all in what is left, or keep adding $100 over the length of the crash. Yes there is some risk and guessing involved, but in all honesty, only put in what you could afford to lose. For me today it was $115. Maybe tomorrow ill throw in another $100. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:41:12

To your second point, when I swipe a debit card the money is not instant. It takes time, however it "cleared" before hand by checking sums in my account and making sure the account the money being transitioned to is real with a series of checks and authorizations. It then takes time. The money pends for settlement. Then and only then is the transaction finalized. However, I did not have to wait to get my groceries.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:11:44
BTC is the "gold" of currencies. All other coins are compared to it. People are seeing the alt coins slowly drop in value and are moving into BTC because it is "safe" in comparison. BTC is the foundation of cryptos.
This could make the price go up if enough people are switching their alts for BTC. 
However, it could be the put all my crypto in BTC, when it Forks I will receive the same amount of coin in the forked currency, and then use the new currency to buy more BTC or more alts. 
Most likely it is a mixture of both.

get the BTC into an electrum wallet if you are on HODLing. If you are trying to sell at $100, then keep it on the exchange. Regardless, it is your generation that will bring BTC to the mainstream.

So on your laptop, mining BTC would be worthless. We see at gaming PC level that if you are willing to use your GPU you can make 50 cents to $1.25 USD a day depending on the GPU that you use. Most people who are mining BTC with real power to be able to actually make some money off of it are using special devices made to mine that cost $1700 USD and higher.
People who have taken to a hobby level have bought up 3-5 GPUs USED that are good at mining, use them till they get their ROI and sell the GPUs as used hardware to make back a lot of their initial investment.

Coinbase will kill in your fees. Gemini will not. Coinbase supports the segwit2x fork coming in November, and Gemini has not made a statement so far, I believe. But other than that, they both do the same thing.

Specifically no. I dont really trust any of them to give me the right answer, but if I read a few and they have a common trend between them, I will usually try to find evidence to support that trend.
In my opinion, try to avoid websites that support Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:39:15
This is also true. I think everyone is on the HODL mentality currently because of the limit in daily use for purchases with businesses. If I could go to Starbucks and use my phone wallet to buy a coffee just like I do with their app where I give them money in advance as a credit to my account then I think more people would be willing to use it as a daily currency. That is where adoption becomes the problem. The blockchain could handle BTC being used a daily currency easily, its just going to take some major business to hop on board. Newegg already has. Amazon has plans to hop on board, but that is speculation based off of word through the grape vines at this point as no official announcement has been made. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:52:43

Most BTC is out of China already. On the 30th, Chinese just cant buy more BTC using Yuan. However, on the 30th of October they will also be stopping the exchange of BTC to Yuan. However, BTCC has stated so far that their mining department is unaffected by the "ban". Signs are pointing that this BTC ban is not a ban and more of a temporary halt until China is able to find a way to combat fraud using BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-10 19:06:51

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:24:29
I was using Coinbase for a long time because of the instant access to the BTC off of a debit card transaction. That makes the fees worth it sometimes. If you are just buying BTC to hodl, then GDAX. $100 USD purchase only has a .25 fee where as on Coinbase the fee would be $4. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:51:41
I believe 4 to 5 days on Coinbase because that is how long an ACH transfer takes your bank. Everyone likes to think that their money is in their accounts instantly, but it is not. Fro example, Payroll. The bank credits you the money on the condition that whatever money being deposited into the account is actually going to clear while they wait for the Automated Clearing House(ACH) to process the transaction. If it doesn't clear be ready for them to take that credit back. Another example would be a check. When I deposit a check into my checking account, if it is more than $200, they will credit me with $200 and the rest when it finally clears. Checks are different than ACH transfers so those process quicker. 
Edit: I did some more reading and apparently different banks can take longer. Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:16:11
Okay. That I agree with. Stating that something has shown a long term trend of upward movement does not mean the price will follow that trend. BTC could be worth nothing tomorrow if the right events occurred. However, I do believe you can use a mix of trend lines, current statistics on buying and selling, as well some human psychology, and world news to make a prediction on what the price will do.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:42:16
What I worry is that it being a replacement for databases is good enough as it provides an error proof database of records, transactions, etc that creates a decentralized consensus
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:18:08
Most people on here will give you bad answers, but here is my best try at answering your question.
1.) World News - See what is going on with BTC around the world. China announced a ban and the price dropped from an ATH to $3000 USD. World news is a big indicator on what will happen with the price if you read up on it. Right now watch China, South Korea, and Russia as they countries with some big players in BTC. We saw resilience with BTC price after China. Hopefully that continues. 
2 - Human Psychology - When the price begins to drop around ~5-10% people get anxious that it will crash. Or those that bought in at a high price are beginning to lose money and want to minimize their losses. There is also this mentality when it comes to the price going up but reverse. If the price goes up enough people do not want to miss out. You will see the acronym "FOMO" - Fear of Missing Out go around a lot. This causes more to buy bringing the price up even more. However, usually after these periods there will be what is called a correction, where the price comes back down as the people who got in for the quick profit sell, and those who want to buy slowly fade away.
3 - Analytics - You can go to websites and read people's analytical review of what they think BTC will do given certain market statistics. RSI, Stoch RSI, and Fibonacci Retracement Levels are ones you see commonly. You will learn the lingo pretty quick and if anything confuses you, google search it to figure it out. There are tons of places that will give a barebones definition to a point where you will understand what that metric/indicator is telling you.
HOWEVER, none of these are perfect. No one can tell you for sure what will happen to the BTC in the long run. It is up to you to do your research and make INFORMED decisions on when to buy, or when to sell, or if you want hold your BTC for years.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:44:46
I understand the HODL mentality, but I truly do not think that most HODLers see Segwit2x has the potential to turn your holdings into nothing. This is way more serious than I ever imagined because I was seeing so much support withdrawn from Segwit2x, but as we get closer to the date and I'm watching the signaling all signs are pointing to this hardfork being relatively successful as Bitcoin Cash has arguably been. Where the issue gets amplified is by the big companies that act as exchanges and wallets are going to follow the miners. The miners have all the control with Segwit2x, which is not decentralization in the least bit but no one in this subreddit wants to talk about this in productive manner. What incentives are there for a miner to continue to mine the core legacy blockchain if they can make more money from the Segwit2x? The fact that it is even possible to hardfork with BTC is a problem in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-01 00:36:49
Does "Started" on the website mean someone already got it. I cannot tell if the challenges are claimed yet

Maybe localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:57:04
Yep! You get the gist. Overall, your local wallet (like an Electrum Wallet) is plenty safe for the storage of bitcoin.
Exchanges are nice to keep some BTC on in case you need to sell fast. If you are on the HODL side of things, I would move all or most BTC into a local wallet as you have no reason or plan to sell before the split occurs on Nov 18th. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:12:54
Agreed. The people who talk about how they plan to retire on BTC or that they invest in BTC so that one day they can sell for fiat and retire early give me a bad taste in my mouth. These people do not see BTC for the purpose that it serves, they see it as profit. That will only hinder the possibility of BTC becoming a more commonly used currency. Currently, there is only 1 store in my city that I know of that takes BTC, however when you go to their website their is only a tiny part on how they accept BTC and they require that the transaction be done in person. Now the in person part I do not mind, but the fact it is not largely stated on their website makes me feel like they just accept it because they look at it as a way to get new business. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:08:46
Donot use Coinbase as they support the hard fork coming in November that will create a new kind of BTC in which they have intention to call Bitcoin as if it is the current currency when it is not. It is an attack on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:03:29
Yeah what the fuck. It was highly publicized that the hard fork would occur at block 494,784. Why is it happening 3000 blocks early....
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:45:28
Whatever exchange you bought coins off of will credit them to your account. However, Coinbase for example is going to credit people who bought BTC on their exchange Bitcoin Cash. HOWEVER, they are going to do it when they are ready but have no legal obligations to do so. 
Someone let me know if I am wrong. I have always been a little confused by this Hardfork and was on hiatus of BTC on the other fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:37:28

You are very correct. Maybe I should have not used the word Ponzi in my title. I used it because a conversation I had on here resulted in the other party calling BTC a ponzi scheme so it popped into my head when making this post. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:14:45
That is just impossible. Currently if you look at inventions that became what we consider "normal" in the every day american's life their adoption was already occurring at a much faster rate than BTC. While BTC is growing well in my opinion and I still believe for it to be way too early to call BTC a viable option for replacing fiat in the long term, there is still a lack consensus within the BTC community on what BTC should be.

To answer your question, the price of the meal would come into effect for me. If I went to a super nice dinner that costs $200, no I do not think I would want to pay in BTC because I feel that $200 could grow with BTC instead. If it is a $3 cup of coffee, I would without hesitation pay with BTC as that is an amount I can easily replace.  
My follow up is that I think if BTC became more accepted as currency for your daily transactions such as a coffee, snacks, meals from cheap restaurants, grabbing some milk at the store, etc that while the initial movement in price would go up, that it would level out and the volatility of BTC would decrease to a point that people would become more and more comfortable with spending it on that $200 meal knowing that it is unlikely that before they could replenish that spent amount, that it would grow in a substantial way. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:53:20
Look at China and Russia. China has outright banned the exchange of Yuan to BTC starting Sept 30th. When the news got out, BTC fell to $3000 USD. Days later everyone was trading in South Korea and Japan more than ever. 1 month later BTC is beating its all time high with resistance showing at $5400. Russia announced it had plans to make all cyrptos illegal and the growth still has not stopped. Regulated BTC will be a challenge for governments because of the peer to peer system is utilizes.
The proof is in the BTC pudding.

Very correct. I have gone there for financial advice. I follow max out your 401k, have an emergency fund, I pay off my student loans aggressively and use the rest of what I don't need for living, food, etc to invest in BTC and do some things that keep me sane. I'm not the most financially responsible person because sometimes I'll eat Chipotle 3 or 4 times in a week but I try. I'm not saying people shouldn't follow their advice,  it is just a shame those people don't allow BTC as even a thought of something you could invest in before shutting it down
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:35:44
When you create an electrum wallet, it will generate a 12 word key that is unique only to you. You would write down this key and store it somewhere safe. In the case that your wallet is corrupted, hard drive failed, OS corrupted, or anything bad you would use this 12 word key to restore the wallet and be able to access all your BTC. A plus side to electrum is that it is considered a lightweight wallet, meaning that you do not need to download the entire blockchain in order to use it. Instead it requests the information needed for the blockchain from the electrum servers. Furthermore, you can also add a layer of protection by password protecting wallets. This means that not only do you have the 12 word key to restore the wallet, but that even if someone knew the key, they would also need to know the password to the wallet to access your BTC.
In addition, Blockchain has announced that they will support the hard forked BTC (segwit2x) coming in November. Now, it is up to you to do your research on which side you want to be on, but personally segwit2x is nothing less than an attack on BTC to be controlled by the few instead of keeping it decentralized (This is a very oversimplified expression). Since I do not support Segwit2x, I am trying to support businesses and wallets that also DO NOT support Segwit2x. Electrum is one of those companies. Thus, I also use Gemini as an exchange as they also DO NOT support Segwit2x.  
  
I know that was a lot and I just kind of spewed it all out. If you have any questions just let me know and I will gladly help out. You have a great investment strategy for what you're doing. Great job!
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:09:24
This is true and I understand where you are coming from but I truly don't think it is a scheme by any means. I would also say that anyone who buys BTC or gives the advice to buy BTC knows that this is about as high risk as an investment as there is and that should be told to anyone you give the advice of buying bitcoin to. I get that can make it sound like a pyramid scheme, but look at the technology behind it. Blockchain is a powerful tool. So powerful in fact that big businesses and fortune 500 companies (especially those in the stock market/banking/finance side of things) are beginning to hire positions that require a high level understanding of blockchain technology. The fundamental foundation is strong with BTC and more and more people are using it. There are 250,000 transactions a day that involve Bitcoin. While I know this is not a large amount and by now means does this mean that BTC is going blow all other forms of currency out of the water, but it is a start.  
I have used my BTC to buy tangible things. I have used my BTC to send people money (they would move it back to USD after I sent it to them). I have used BTC in almost any manner you can use fiat currency. The possibility is there, but the support is what matters. If BTC is going to succeed it will need much more support than it has now. Anyone in the BTC game is an early adopter currently. The earlier you get in, the more skeptical people will be.
My question to you becomes, what is it about the currency you use now that makes legitimate? What makes it not a scheme of some kind?

Click that link above to see a list that will tell what companies support what. It is incomplete as not all of the companies utilizing bitcoin have made an announcement or stated which way they lean.

@_date: 2017-10-10 19:02:56
Its because this was done via a bank transfer. Coinbase will hold the coins until payment has been received. This usually takes 4-5 business days. Most exchanges these days will place a hold on withdrawing. ALSO, those fees are insane. The same purchase for BTC on Gemini would have resulted in $12 in fees... 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:00:12
BTCC said that people dont need to get their money out of BTC until Oct 30th. However, they are no longer going to let people buy more BTC. Overall, positive news that could have helped.
Speculation might be that something happened with Segwit2x, that had a negative effect on segwit2x. Someone who knew this information used it to buy in now, other people found out, they bought it. BTC news can be a little slow.
Lots of people have come out recently saying that banks are afraid of BTC. Then banks make statements saying BTC will fail. However, the banks actions dont align with these word of failure as they hire positions related to the blockchain.
Last but not least, when the price starts to jump up, some people want to get in to catch the ride, others want to sell to get out. Currently it depends on how many BTC are for sale at a certain price, and how many are being asked to be bought at a certain price. Where these two meets decides the price. Currently as we are near a round $100 number ($4200) you see more resistance in growth because people have placed sell order for their BTC to be sold at these prices. Humans like nice numbers like 4200 or 4100 or 4300 because they are nice and simple to use. We just have to get there with enough demand to surpass it and it will shoot up to 4300 or so and then have the same battle. So hope that more people start buying as we need the demand of BTCs to be greater than the number of BTCs at $4200 to surpass it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:46:18
It is 100% not an opportunity to bet on black market anything. Yes, these marketplaces utilize BTC but that was because of the "anonymity" they believe it provided. Soon they learned that every transaction on the blockchain is VERY traceable. Now they have started using other currencies. Currently Monero is their crypto of choice. The reason is that it uses a CryptoNote protocol that hides the sender and receiver and amount of coin sent. It is actually a very intriguing and simple way introducing an anonymous system.

Being in long haul is the only true way to be in btc. The HUGE surges are way too random to predict so short term investing is tough.

If you pretend this never happened you will be fucked on credit. At 16 I know that doesn't mean much but older you will kick yourself. Just present your side to the bank. Maybe they choose to forgive it. Most Likely you are going to have to pay it back. If that happens they hopefully will understand and let you set up a payment plan
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:05:11
THIS! I am sure you figured it out by now, but you can only send slightly less than your total BTC because they use some your BTC to cover fees and that stuff. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:49:56
That is worth using in my opinion and if you use it right, you can avoid all fees completely 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:28:13
$0 on a current promotion of no fees on domestic transactions. This card converts BTC into FIAT and then moves that money between your account and whoever the transaction was with. So, it is not REALLY using BTC to purchase something. It automates the exchange of BTC into fiat that is then paid to the business the card was used at.
Cool? Yes. Going to change BTC? Not at all.

I check when I get to work to see what the price is. Then I might check again when I get home. More important than the price is reading the news around BTC. This will help you way more in the long term. Buy the dips every time. Buy a little when I get paid. HODL.

So there are investment strategies when you have a sum of money you want to invest. A high risk, high reward strategy is putting all your money in it at one time at one price. If the price falls, you lose big. If the price raises, you win big. I advise against this.
Instead, maybe 25% of what you want to invest today. Buy another 25% in 2 weeks if you feel comfortable doing so. Hold that other 50% till after the fork. Then invest it all if you feel it is right or hold on to if you dont think it is right. This method will help you from losing big, but it also will keep you from winning AS big as just getting all the money in now. Personally, at this stage of BTC you are still a rather early adopter. 
BTC is very volatile in price. It was $4300 just a couple days ago. Now it is around $4800 but has heavy resistance around the $4850 mark. If the price pushes past $4850, id expect to see $5000 not too long after. As for predicting the price after the fork... your guess is as good as mine. When China announced their ban the price fell hard and I bought in with 25% of what I could stand to lose. Couple weeks later I did another 25%, and then my last 50% right before this latest bump. 
Russia just announced their plan to ban all crypto so the price of BTC and all Alts might fall if the official legislation is passed. However, BTC showed its resilience to China. I imagine it will do the same with Russia.
Read the news surrounding BTC. That will help you gauge the price movement. I would also look into price analysis of BTC. However, this is kind of like a blog of opinion on price. Nothing they say is for sure. However, if you read 4-5 price analysis you might be able to gather some common trends between them that give you an idea.

You raise a valid point that I did not even think about...  My apologies! 
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:39:03
Exactly. How can we be about a month out from this hardfork and Coinbase not make their decision. They really could hurt people if they make an announcement too late. My advice to anyone is get their BTC off of the exchange and into a wallet like Electrum.

I like the comparison you made about how BTC is really hybrid market of collectibles and commodities. I will start using that as a way to explain BTC to friends and other people I come across. You seem like someone who has a level head about the whole situation that is BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:17:25
I feel there is also another part to that sentiment of the human brain tends to mold the facts to fit something that it does understand. I feel people associate that BTC "is as good as cash" but people combat that thought with, "then why dont you use cash?". It is that lack of understanding of the fundamental reason BTC was created as a peer to peer commerce platform that I believe will be a HUGE hurtle for BTC to overcome. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:13:59
you need a new wallet with a new private key or seed. If you put money in the old one, he could just take it as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:04:26
I think the only reason you dont see people using it more is because of the lack of business that accept it. It is a currency with a foundation like that of gold where there is a finite amount and once we run out, we run out. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:49:18
Thank you! So when you recover it through the seed, would the BTC in your balance be available immediately or would it need time to redownload the blockchain to account for the BTC you have or something?
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:07:44
Yeah, the 4th block confirmed and it still is pending. My guess is maybe its not getting picked up by a miner because of how small of an amount I sent. $5 with the coinbase automatic fee it brought the total to $6.23.  
  
Other than that, it could just be Coinbase being slow. Im going to get some sleep and check in the morning when I wake up.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:58:33
Yes and No. There are people who just buy some BTC with plans of holding on to it and that one day it will be a currency they can use just like the currency that your country uses. The idea here is that if they buy BTC now and wait, that one day it might be worth $238,000 USD for 1BTC. If that is the case, and you get in now it could make you rich. However, that is very wishful thinking but where the TO THE MOON mantra stems from.
There are also day traders. They buy a lot of BTC during drops in price, wait for it to go back up and sell it. They pocket the profit, and then use another large sum of money to buy a lot of BTC and repeat.
The price of BTC is dictated by demand. If lots of people are selling, the price will go down. If lots of people are buying, the price will go up. Certain prices have high resistance meaning that people are planning on selling at or around that price. This resistance can cause the price to stay below the resistance level until all the BTC is bought up at that price. However, this is a very simplified view of it. In reality, there are limitless factors that effect BTC but you just have to stay up to date. When China, "banned" BTC the price dropped from around the $4300 to $3000 USD area because everyone in China started selling their BTC and thus putting lots of BTC up for sale. Since more BTC was going up for sale then being bought, the price went down. Nevertheless, other countries in the mean time have shown support for BTC and this has helped BTC rebound from the China "Ban".  
  
Hope that gave you a little insight. If you have any questions, just let me know.

I have read in many Segwit2x blogs that if it becomes the more "successful" of the 2 that they many exchanges will openly call the coming hard forked currency Bitcoin. Im about to be at work, so let me do some research when I have some down time. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:16:33
Dont use coinbase. They will kill you with fees and overcharging for the BTC. Try Gemini or GDAX. A simple google search of either of those will result with that you want.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:30:28
And there is a link saying the exact opposite unless BTC falls below 4180 today. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:00:12
If you are looking to get in short term, and try to day trade. Probably not worth it. If you are on the hold on to it and see how does long term that is a good amount to start with

This. Those people push the "American Dream" way of saving. 401ks, Roth IRAs, personal saving.

Dont freak out. Just the ride the dip and before you know it you will be looking down at $5,000. BitFinex announced that they will no longer accept US business. Given that BitFenix is one of the largest exchanges, this is causing people to sell. I have heard that as much of 10% of all BTC bought in the US was bought using BitFenix. That is a nice sizeable chunk. However, I believe that it will work out in the end. My advice, attempt to buy some more in the dip if you can. We are seeing that people are starting to pull out of the segwit2x, which is good. The list of people opposed is ever growing.

Thank you! I wish more people understood this. I could ask my coworker right next to me, "Hey. When you use your debit card for a transaction do you know how the money goes from you to them?" and I bet their answer is it moves the money from my account to theirs. While yes that is technically correct, it is a VERY simplified answer. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:58:45
I assume that means it will show that BTC has been sent to that address, but then that bitcoin has also left that address? CorrecT?
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:46:54
What I worry about is that businesses are only taking notice to the Blockchain. They do not care for BTC, but they care for the foundation it was built on.

Honestly surprised me how much is spent on printing it.
