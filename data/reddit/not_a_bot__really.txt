New product idea: a wallet with an additional password (to give to the crooks, err, I mean government.) It would only show a small bitcoin investment... not the actual one. Or, allow multiple passwords/storage in one wallet. Then you could just choose which to give to them. "Yeah, I just started with this Bitcoin thing, and I only have a few buck in it for now...here's my (fake) password."
Of course, they'd have to give the wallet back to get your other balances....

Yeah, let's not start a discussion or anything (47 comments later), the mods might have to work....

Just goes to show that you have no idea what the value is really based upon... nothing but perception.
Once the Feds see it as a legitimate challenge to their fiat currency, it will all come crashing down.

They have to "see" the money first! What you can't see, you can't have...

That's soo cute, thinking that OUR government would ever allow another currency to displace the dollar. All they have to do is make it illegal to accept bitcoin as currency, and BAM, its all gone. Do you really think that you'll be able to keep using it for it's purchasing power, when there isn't any left? Sure, you might be able to buy something illegally from overseas, but how's that working for others who regularly do it now? They get their accounts seized, and likely arrested at the airport, that's what they get.

Yeah, totally unpredictable! It's like there's no real meaning behind the price....

Yep, right up until the government bans it! I can't see the Fed just letting any other currency undermine their dollars value. The whole invasion of Iraq was due to their desire to switch the currency used by OPEC to something other than the US dollar.

Except that right now, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and very little "backing", and is attempting to compete with the US Dollar. All the Gov't has to do is state that only it's version of Bitcoin will be recognized in the US and all others are forbidden (search for gold confiscation.) So, highly risky to hold for any long term period.

Wow, your ignorance of financial tracking is unbelievable. So why hasn't barter taken-off then? Do you get a paycheck in Bitcoin? How would you convert cash to bitcoin without the government knowing? Just like the current pot financial industry (or, rather, lack-of), until the feds say it's good to go, it ain't. There's a hell of a lot more demand for weed than bitcoin and yet, the feds resist until they can guarantee their taxes get collected. Do you pay taxes on your bitcoin transactions? If not, then it's just a matter of time before the whole bitcoin industry collapses from government interference.
