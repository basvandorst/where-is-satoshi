In the UK you can transfer money from your bank to Intersango online for free and it arrives within a few hours - Mt.gox also have a UK bank account and it would be as quick to them.
Unsure why people are making it so complicated for themselves.

A big company investing in Bitcoin doing this could seriously move the value of Bitcoin.
Imagine if Radiohead gave 0.3btc reward as a qr code in their first 10,000 new cds, having already purchased 3000btc to cover this and an extra 50,000btc personal investment. The news would quadruple the value of bitcoin overnight, and the 50,000btc investment would suddenly be worth $1 million.

Yeah, but the work bitinstant is doing is adding loads to the value of bitcoin. And once you have money in the bitcoin system, they make it very easy to move it around. 
My bitcoins are worth much more than the fee I may have paid bitinstant in their helping me to buy them (I used them to arbitrage in the Tradehill days when bitcoin was around $2.00 - those bitcoins are now worth over $5. They are welcome to their cut).

I'm currently watching season 2 of walking dead which I downloaded illegally via bittorrent - call the cops (I'm in China).  I doubt I'm the only one doing this.
People don't care about legal or otherwise - they care about getting prosecuted. 
No one will ever be prosecuted for using bitcoin since they are not doing anything inherently evil or bad.

You should contact the people at Britcoin (now Intersango) and ask them why you are having problems.
Also note that Britcoin have changed their account details, so the money is perhaps being bounced becasue the account you are using doesn't exist. The fact that you are still calling them 'Britcoin' suggests you haven't updated their account details.

The wallet.dat is a set of keys. ie it is the access. You can copy the wallet.dat as many times as you like and each will access the same money. Duplicating wallet.dat is NOT like opening 2 bank accounts. 
If you copy a physical key it will still open the same door (a new door won't be created) - the word wallet is a misnomer - it should be called keyset.dat
The trouble is that each wallet.dat only has 100 keys in it - once they are exhausted the wallets will start adding new keys which won't be shared with the other copy wallets. Though there are 'deterministic wallets' that will always create the same key in every copy. I think bitcoinspinner (for Android) uses this technique.

That's my experience

Me too - I normally just move my funds via direct bank transfer. But if I see an opportunity and it makes economical sense to use Bitinstant then I will use them (I'm in China and they are a very cheap way of moving money around the Bitcoin world - cheaper than withdrawing from gox to a chinese bank account and then buying bitcoin on btcchina.com and then withdrawing the bitcoins to another exchange and then selling them there - the arbitrage opportunity has long passed ).  
For some people the anonymity of paying cash presumably has added value too.

You can pay money into any UK bank account anonymously - go into any branch of their bank (Metro bank) with your Intersango account detail and simply fill in a giro and pay cash into their bank account. Unfortunately Metro bank only has branches in London at the moment - but they look like they are keen to expand:

It used to be easy to mine gold - you could do it with a shovel. Why do they still mine gold if there's less of it?
