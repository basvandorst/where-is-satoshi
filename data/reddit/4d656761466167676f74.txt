Um, what? Plenty of online retailers accept Bitcoin. Hell, I payed last month's rent in DOGE.
Crypto isn't useless of you can't convert it to fiat. People accept it just like fiat. It is a currency after all.

Yeah, no. Not anymore. They used to be but now the Tx fee is around $15~$20. Luckily, a lot of businesses now accept altcoin so I pay with LTC, DOGE, GRLC, VTC, ZEC, or XMR.

What's wrong with the title?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:13
I switched my RX 480s to mining ZEC a few months ago. I was mining XMR but ever since Coinhive started it wasn't as profitable anymore.

Only 300%? Enjoy being the owner of *only* 3 yachts and 2 mansions in 10 years.
I however, invest 500% of my paycheck into bitconnect because in 10 years I not only want 2 mansions and 3 yachts but a private jet and a helicopter as well.

I'm assuming he/she is trying to exchange his/her bitcoin for CAD and withdraw that. I've never heard of Coinbase restricting withdrawing crypto by country.
If that's the case the best thing to do is just transfer the BTC to a different exchange and then exchange it to CAD there.
If it's that he/she can't withdraw his/her crypto then that sounds like a bug. Contact support.

I didn't know there was a monoclonal emoji.

That's why is having trouble withdrawing from it. The owners forgot to renew the domain.

Alright but what time period of 4chan memes? 2018 memes are very different from the 2010 memes and everything in-between.

The moral of the story is it doesn't matter when you buy in, if you hodl long enough you'll make a yuuuuge profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:40:40


Are you implying Donald Trump would ban Bitcoin like China? I really doubt that. Also, AFAIK Coinbase hasn't done anything illegal so I see no reason they would be taken out in handcuffs.

Won't be up much longer of we lose net neutrality.

I like that. I'm going to start using that.

This is clearly stated in their ToS and FAQ. It's not something they just spring on people. 
That being said, I suspect it has something to do with the fact they act more like a bank than an exchange/wallet.  Still, even to get something like a greendot card you need to provide all of that info. They're basically don't the same thing (except your funds are stored in bitcoin). You get an account number/routing number and a debit card with xapo. Not only that but they operate in several countries. I suspect different governments require them to collect this information in an attempt to prevent money laundering and whatnot.

I'm watching old episodes of To Catch A Predator while I Reddit and found this comment ironic.
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:46:15
Still, why so high?
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:57:25
I mean, I buy them.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:03:48
I never thought about it this way. That's how I will look at it from now on.

[Earlier this year someone took out a home equity loan on their home to buy bitcoin]( They've already doubled their money in a few months.

Google glass never went away. It's going to be used in places like wearhouses. Also, it was never sold as a finished product unlike the Segway. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:35:26
I'm not entirely sure it matters. It's all about your frame of reference. Also, given that Bitcoin is immune to inflation (among other things) in a way out seems like a more logical argument.
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:00:18
Yeah, but still, why are they trading it at such high value?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:16:56
Until then I'm fine with these forks. I'm rather happy with the free money.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:01:36
Don't sell all of it. Dude has like $300,000 of additional bitcoin to play with.
