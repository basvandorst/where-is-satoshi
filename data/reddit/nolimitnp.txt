You all sold everything you had for bitcoin before it happened?  And you will if it forks a third time, right? I mean shit, getting free money as an individual and just let the market make up for it at a later date. Makes perfect logical sense. 
Think people. The day before the fork (I think) , Poloniex updated their TOS, to include the inability to be involved in class action lawsuits. And they refused to release their customers BCC for 2 weeks. Why? Something is wrong.

If I'm wrong I'd love an explanation. I'm mad at I didn't sell everything before the fork. It it forks again, I want to be ready.

Why bother even doing research or technical analysis when you can just compare prices from separate exchanges? People do, it's called arbitrage, but so fishy there's a 20% gain to be had on the one day the Lisk wallet is down for "maintenance".

At one point I had 600 Ethereum. When litecoin went to $6, I watched for 6 straight hours as the buy/sell chart was being populated. There was obviously a pattern. I was so positive it was headed to at least $40 that I traded it all for Litecoin AND bought on margin. The exact second I did that, the price began falling. I had the ability to stop or at least slow the fall. I couldn't buy from the sell column, stop losses went ignored, and orders were immediately pushed down in the queue. Immediately after I was forced to liquidate, the price began to rise again. $17k or at its peak, $244k,  gone, just like that. If you've ever lost on margin, there's a high probability it had nothing to do with your analysis of the market. 
As you can imagine it broke my heart. But at the same time, it's given me a new perspective. These exchanges are all scams. We have so many $$$$ signs in our eyes that we're ignoring the most basic of market fundamentals. These markets have absolutely zero regulation and how you can can just trust there's nothing shady going on is beyond me. Absolute power corrupts and power corrupts absolutely. These exchanges take a small percentage of every trade. After a few hundred million trades, it adds up. Whales of every cryptocurrency are literally running the exchanges, manipulating the price as they see fit. If you knew exactly when to sell and buy back in to collect market share, would you? If they decide to pull the plug, which absolutely they could do at any time with no repercussions, we're all fucked. You've already heard the rumors about Poloniex, right? 
This bitcoin cash thing is just my latest example of wtf is happening, this doesn't make sense. I don't want anyone to experience the pain I experienced. If you want to believe everything is fine without questioning anything, and that money really is this easy to make, be my guest. I sincerely hope you make it.

Thank God I'm not the only one sees the problem here. Notice Coinbase, one of the few exchanges that allows you to convert back to fiat, won't release BCC until Januray. Why would they do that? Because if customers cashed out BCC immediately, it would be obvious they're insolvent. 
Listen, the market has done nothing but continuously rise. You'd be a fool to convert back to fiat at this time since we know it will only continue to rise. Right? You idiots, Coinbase could be insolvent as we speak and we'd have absolutely no idea because no one is selling. This is fucking ponzi scheme.

The Real reason China is Banning Exchanges: Cryptocurrency is a Ponzi Scheme
There is no opinion available to be had. You either understand cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme and get out while you can, or you lose all of your money. I'm sorry, but there is no way to sugarcoat this. Did we really believe money was this easy to make? Ugh

You're missing the entire point. You know what, I'll never get through to some of you and frankly won't even feel bad when you lose all of your money. Ask yourself a question, how long would it take you to get $100k converted back into fiat? At least a couple weeks. That's by design. And you're gonna tell me "I'm not selling anyway". That thought process is also by design

Paxil made me attempt suicide when I was 25. I just kinda shoved the entire experience to be the back of my mind. It literally took until last year to realize I had absolutely zero reason to be as depressed as I was. It was the drug :( The pharmaceutical industry could care less about creating cures. Always remember healthy people aren't profitable. The brain isn't finished growing until about age 25. If I had but one wish I never would have started taking anything. I feel I've destroyed my brain forever and will never recover. Obviously I'm not you, but I despise any drugs taken long term. We don't even understand exactly they work! It's about $$$$
Just, be careful if you're going to use it anyway. Always find the lowest dosage that works. Don't assume more = better. It doesn't. When bitcoin forked, if you went to sleep with 1 BTC @ $2800 you woke up with 1 BTC @ $2800 and 1 BCH @ $400. Where did the $400 come from? Why do I seem to be the only person who questions it? Coinbase, one of the few exchanges to convert back to fiat, won't release bitcoin cash until January. Why? They're not giving Away free money.
Cryptocurrency, in its current form, is a giant Ponzi scheme. How easy it for you to sell everything you have back into fiat right now? If you have $100k plus, probably several weeks. That's by design. The bottom line is cryptocurrency can no longer be valued in fiat.
Stop shooting the God damned messenger. I'm trying to help you. I can try to explain it, but I can't understand it for you

A Chinese exchange is voluntary shutting down October 1st. There are rumors everywhere China will ban exchanges. The same goes with ICOs. Poloniex updates their TOS to include the inability to be involved in class action lawsuits. Coinbase waits until January to release BCH. Poloniex waited 2 weeks. There are red flags all over the place. But you? Naaaah nothing to see here you damned conspiracy theorist. 
And when it comes right down to it, did you ever really believe money was THIS easy to make?
Roger Ver is Satoshi Nakomoto. Google Roger Ver St. Kitts. If Ver had 1,000,000 BTC when it forked, he gave himself a $400,000,000 pay day. Makes a bit more sense why he pushed so hard for the fork doesn't it?

You, my friend, might get it. Every single person reading this is a long term HODLer. Most of you have never even considered withdrawaling back into fiat. Did you know Coinbase only allows $10k withdrawals per day after a long verification process and then has further weekly monthly limits? If your portfolio is worth $1 million its going to take you more than 100 days to withdrawal everything. Think about that for a minute. Cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme. They don't want you to withdrawal.

Cryptocurrency, in its current form, is a giant Ponzi scheme. Why is no one but seemingly me seeing the connection between coinbase and refusing to release their customers bitcoin cash? They can't afford to give away "free money".

Remember John "I'll eat my dick on TV if Bitcoin doesn't hit $500,000" McAfee? Odd, he's in business with Roger Ver. Weird right?

When bitcoin cash was created people got "free money" just for owning bitcoin. More than $4 billion was added to the total market cap, but no new money ever entered the system. Coinbase won't release bitcoin cash until January. They give another bullshit technical reason for it. But the real reason is its just good business not to give away free money. If just 10% of their customers immediately cashed out we'd know that they were insolvent. Cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:59:28
Why isn't anyone asking where the original $400 value of Bitcoin Cash came from? If you went to bed with 1 BTC @ $2800 before the fork, you woke up with 1 BTC @ $2800 and 1 BCH @ $400. If Roger Ver has 1,000,000 BTC, he gave himself a $400,000,000 pay day, for doing absolutely nothing.
