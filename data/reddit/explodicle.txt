I wouldn't pay for a hotel room with physical gold, but would if I had a gold-backed bank account or if they accepted Bitcoin through Expedia. So per your example if my hotel room costs $200, the $0.15 (high value) fee is 0.075%. I also don't have to spend time notifying the credit card company that I'm traveling.
Hotel rooms and beating credit cards at their own game would be great, but it's not why I care. It's not exclusively about circumventing restrictions either, but to me at least that's part of what really sets it apart.

He's referring to the 1 megabyte block size limit; it's been really controversial for the last couple years so someone finds a reason to complain about it in every thread.
There's going to be a small block size increase in a few months (segregated witness) and a big upgrade to _transactions_ per second afterwards (lightning network), but [at least one Bitcoin expert]( thinks we'll need "sidechains" to scale long-term (FWIW I agree with him).

How is that any better? Bitcoin sees coins go into an exchange/mixer, then it sees coins come out of an exchange/mixer. In both cases you need to trust someone to hold your coins, and in both cases they go into an opaque box and get shuffled around. With altcoins you trust a third party for a shorter period of time but expose yourself to more exchange rate risk.

_Right now_ the fees are still low compared to existing alternatives! No matter how low fees get, you'll always be able to create a transaction large enough to cost $7. Even with no explicit block size limit, miners would optimize _their own_ profits with an emergent de facto limit as a function of orphan rate.
Maybe it's just the people I meet (USA), but plenty if not most have heard of Bitcoin already, and the reason they don't use it is they're worried their money won't be safe. I don't think they'd be swayed by forced updates that risk ETHing up the network for very little gain.

After waiting 2.5 years for another bubble, I now find myself hoping it'll wait a little longer just so LN can handle the scale. It's not a final scaling solution but should still be enough for the next few waves.
Either that or the newbies might foolishly keep their coins on exchanges like they tend to do, in which case they won't wise up until after LN is ready anyways.

LN uses payment channels to "compress" many transactions between nodes on a big spider-web-looking graph. It's all using the bitcoin blockchain. You trust other node operators to not waste your transaction fees by prematurely closing payment channels, but they get paid more if they cooperate and they can't steal your money.

I'm not arguing that convenience should be a priority, I'm arguing that it's already more convenient at similar levels of proficiency. We've just grown up in a credit card world so the inconveniences I've listed seem normal.
Most of what I listed is just because of 1950's technology; a more modern payment system should be immune to all of those, but only Bitcoin is... Because liberty.
I agree that Bitcoin sites should be more secure, and would add that they should buy deposit insurance. Cheap transactions should come back with scalability, and I've heard there are a few ideas for how to improve that.

That was my main objection for years. There's a few different methods - assurance contracts, insurance, etc. Right now a solution I think the world really needs ASAP is climate prediction markets; nearly everyone would bet on local climate problems as insurance, and defense agencies would bet against pollution and then go after aggressors. This is limited by the transaction costs of the market (Coase Theorem) but cryptocurrency could reduce those, and it needs to be compared to the efficiency of voting with state-based solutions.

In most cases the would-be polluter has the best information, would bet against pollution, and then reduce it themselves. Like police, only the threat needs to be there for 99% of problems.
All internalized externalities should result in economic gains, and I'd argue it's necessary if we're already polluting far too much.


No, only as a means of defense. If you're going to refer to it as "magical", you'll have a tough time finding more mature people than me to discuss this with.

They already need to make down payments ahead of time (buying bitcoins) before they can spend. By the time LN is ready for mass use (which it isn't now), the user won't be exposed to channels. Their initial buy will establish a payment channel with whoever sold them their coins, and if their software can't find a route for later purchases then it'll create a new channel automatically. 


How do you think it's different from [this demo video]( I understand that copying and pasting a long address is a pain in the neck, but that will eventually be streamlined with [URIs like bitcoin: links have now]( [payment protocols]( etc.


There are exchange fees between coins, and then either the low liquidity of unpopular alts or the censorship risk of popular alts. If they're already using Bitcoin, then they can upgrade to a LN client in a single transaction. The average person doesn't care to understand how their money works; just that it does.
By the time it's ready for mass use, the user will care as much about LN channels as they care about finding peers and relaying transactions.

IIRC right now we've got about 2% inflation, and car loans are about 3.5%, part of which is due to inflation.  Bitcoin's current growth rate isn't sustainable and would deflate at a low rate when the market is saturated.
So we'd still get loans, but there would be slightly less of them. More people would rent and save than do now. There are some advantages to this (I did it already) so it's not strictly a bad thing. Individual car ownership might already be going away in ~10 years with autonomous Ubers anyways.

The simple reason was that it would provide a temporary benefit in exchange for long-term consequences. LN is being tested by real businesses on the mainnet right now. Later this year it'll be more widespread. Then Channel Factories, Drivechains, Schnorr signatures, etc. 
We might _never_ need to increase the block size, and don't know how much censorship-resistant bandwidth is actually available. If bitcoin ever threatens governments, they will hit back HARD. We should probably decrease the block size already, right now, but to do so is politically impossible. We're fighting against much more powerful people than PayPal.

The part you quoted wasn't directly comparing it to banks, that's why I made you a nice clear table showing what's comparable to what. The simple version is that bitcoin gives you something you can safely lock away without trusting anyone, that appreciates in value.

I think scalability and fungibility are inevitable. Onion routed lightning networks with channel factories will be extremely scalable, and compete with Monero in privacy. Either Drivechain or some other type of sidechain will provide further improvements, like ring signatures and Mimblewimble. 
Usability is a little trickier. It needs to be easy to obtain, store, and spend bitcoin securely. Exchanges are about as easy as they can be with AML/KYC and that's still not good enough. P2P exchanges are a step in the right direction but lack liquidity and simplicity. Hardware wallets are easy for _some_ people, but could use more official step-by-step guides, and best practices for actual key storage. Payment protocols like BIP 70 will make spending more secure against phishing but aren't widely adopted yet.

A company is different because the land, employees, machinery, etc can't be split in half and still work at full capacity. A cryptocurrency can.
**Switching costs** between cryptocurrencies are extremely low, especially between two previously identical splits. In Bitcoin's case with competing UASFs, the businesses who aren't prepared to switch anything will simply follow the more valuable and thus most-worked side without any action required. There's no switching cost if they're willing to just follow what's popular anyways.
The individual voter doesn't benefit significantly from voting, so **voter fatigue** is common (even in corporations) leaving the most extreme and unified voters to decide its direction. With futures markets, traders have an incentive to participate both if they care about the outcome (and thus benefit directly) and if they are neutral but think the exchange rate is incorrectly reflecting market demand.
Futarchy has been a better idea than voting since before cryptocurrency even existed. This is just one of its first "natural" applications.

No, you couldn't. Hidden cash will inflate away over time and is thus a terrible way to store wealth, and moving/spending it is difficult to do without detection. 
If gold could be secured with a secret passphrase, had a fixed supply, and could be moved out of the country easily, then I think a lot more people would own gold than do now. If people didn't need to trust their gold to banks in the first place, then bitcoin never would have been necessary.

You input the seed from your paper into the hardware wallet (if the hardware wallet doesn't already have a copy). This generates a private key that it uses to send the bitcoin to an exchange.

That literally the opposite of the truth, as we demonstrated this year. The UASF forced miners to comply because in the event of a split, the segwit chain would be worth more. Segwit2x failed after the chain split tokens forecasted it would be worth _much_ less.
Decred (and any coin with voting) is redundant. As soon as they actually have a contentious issue they'll split anyways, and any rational actor would rather sell the side they dislike than vote their own holdings into oblivion.
Bitcoin just clarified the governance it had all along - it's a futarchy, not a democracy. We each bet our own money, not with everyone's money. This mechanism makes bitcoin inherently more efficient than the corporations Decred tries to recreate.

For example when you make a bad business decision you're allowed to go bankrupt, while [big business is bailed out]( when they make bad decisions. 
If you've just got $1M USD, then you aren't rich enough to matter - you've got to make decisions with the same information available to everyone, and if you fail there is no bailout.

Let's say we make Segwit mandatory. Now all transactions go to [P2SH (pay to script hash) addresses]( and Bech32 addresses. 
Unfortunately, Alice was unaware of this change. She creates a multisig address, which like segwit uses P2SH. She sends this address to Bob, who has no way of knowing it's not a Segwit address, and pays her 1 BTC. 
Later she wants to spend her bitcoin, and tries to send it to another P2SH address. But the miners won't confirm it! They see her script and say "HEY! That's not Segwit, thus not valid!" Now Alice is in deep shit; _only_ a non-segwit script will hash to the address which holds her bitcoin. Her money is, for all intents and purposes, gone forever. 
That's why we generally don't ever make old transaction types invalid. The only exception would be if the old transaction type literally puts the entire network at risk. IIRC this only happened once, with OP_EVAL (someone correct me if this is wrong).

**Hold yourself**|(A) Safe|(B) Cold storage

Previously, only options A and C were available. A and C have different security tradeoffs, but A has a high opportunity cost - you aren't getting any interest. Even gold tends to remain stable, rather than appreciate in value (since the above-ground supply can increase). So most people would choose C, which was good for banks.
Now options B and D are available. B is more secure than A and C, and offers a similar opportunity for growth to C. So now people have an incentive to choose B, which is bad for banks.

The current situation is that credit cards failed the OP and bitcoin worked. If our fantasy involves _only_ switching which system fails and he still has both, then his recourse is to use credit cards until he gets home, then restore his wallet from backup. Since bitcoin is still rare, even if he didn't encrypt his phone the thieves probably won't break the PIN in time, or even think to look for money on a phone.
But that's boring. Let's fantasize he's _only_ using bitcoin, even though almost no one else uses it yet. He'd have to collect call someone to lend him bitcoins, get them to overnight ship or order a store pick-up tablet, and then have them transfer over the coins. That's such a pain in the neck that I wouldn't recommend traveling exclusively with bitcoin yet.

Generally, but workarounds are possible. For example, the consumer could create a transaction using keys on their phone, then the Wi-Fi provider checks its validity, and then internet access is granted. The consumer only needs a connection to verify that the transaction has been relayed.
Since signing this transaction requires trusting the Wi-Fi provider with at least _some_ money, it would work great with a micropayment channel to minimize trust.

Bitcoin reduces the theft/loss risks of holding your own assets, and reduces the opportunity cost of not investing.
Right now most people use a bank because it handles direct deposit, check deposits, bill payments, stores your money securely, and offers at least _some_ interest. To beat that, Bitcoin needs cheaper hardware wallets, well known best practices for cold storage, and lower transaction fees.
We're not there yet, but getting close.

How would block size be increased by soft fork - extension blocks?

(Sorry to be long-winded!)
No offense but that sounds like "with us or against us"; it's reasonable to push for a change without just going ahead and hard-forking it. BIP100 and BIP101 are both reasonable proposals, I'd be happy to run either, but forcing a technical decision of which one(s) to accept onto the general public is a great way to demonstrate a weakness of cryptocurrency compared to centralized systems. "We accept Bitcoin. But not _those_ Bitcoins."
It's good that people can think for themselves and say "no" to The Powers That Be, and we should reserve our right to switch dev teams and hard fork. But with such a nuclear option the equilibrium is for TPTB to cooperate and reach a consensus before the whole thing falls apart. These debates are extremely tiresome but not market-shattering - we're enjoying a strange period of stability.
I'm not going to pretend to be an internet tough guy - I'll run the most popular fair fork, and that might become XT - but I strongly recommend against a contentious hard fork in general. Above all else we need to stick together and remember that the bad guys are the thugs who steal our labor, and they'd love to see us tear each other apart.

Part of what I like about a software-based economic system is that it asks its participants clear, mathematical questions. None of the "oh that's _personal_ property" or "we define capital as" or "but when it's _for money_...". Interpretive gaps like "reasonable" or "probable" should be easy enough to define logically if they're so reasonable or probable.
The lawyers and their words built the old economy; the scientists and their formulas will build the next one. I think society will soon discover that most of the left-right conflict is created artificially to divide otherwise reasonable people into two opposing tribes.

Personally I have no objection to Gavin's 20*1.4^yr proposal. But if we can't get real consensus, I'd rather we default to 1mb with centralized microtransactions than risk shattering the community with Bitcoin XT. If the majority just tramples over the minority on this one, I'm going to hang on to my pre-fork cold storage and not spend until after the 20mb fork gets stress tested - and then check how many connected nodes remain. I'm not really concerned about bad press either way, as I think the smart money and tech-saavy already know about the scalability problems. 
A few questions:
1. Is the effective max 20mb, or 8mb (math error), or something lower? Could someone better at cryptocurrency and more informed link to the math for me?
2. Why aren't we testing this with an "exactly 20mb" altcoin first? This seems like a good way to check what could happen. If this is a bad idea, could someone clue me in as to why?
3. If 20mb _is_ too much, and the number of nodes shrink, which is more likely... an emergency fork to fewer megabytes and slow regrowth in node count, or everyone abandoning the transactions which took place on the 20mb fork and just going back to the still-running 1mb fork?

IMHO that's why the 40% per year is the best part of Gavin's proposal - it allows the blocksize to increase over time. But assuming 20mb is the current max without breaking decentralization, then we can't increase it any more and would have to rely on off-chain microtransactions until scalability is finally fixed with lightning/treechains.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:13:15
I support Gavin's proposed increase and BIP100 but still run a Bitcoin Core node, not Bitcoin-XT. 
It is absolutely outrageous that a _lack of change_ is an "altcoin", and claiming "bitcoin is broken", is being voted to the top of the Bitcoin subreddit. No amount of shouting, insults, and voting are going to change my mind about consensus. Sure, increasing the blocksize is a reasonable idea, but I just don't buy the claims that the skies will rain blood when we have to pay $0.20 transaction fees just after bitcoin explodes in popularity any day now.

Ethereum is an altcoin with fully-programmable smart contracts.
I'm probably using the wrong terminology with "Schelling Oracle". I mean [an Oracle]( which [gets its information with low trust by using Schelling points](
So in the patent case, part of the smart contract would have an Oracle asking "does Amalgamated's widget use Bob's technology as defined by... (clear definition)". Random people on the internet bet on the Schelling point answer, which is most likely the truth. If you've got a law degree you'll more frequently bet correctly and you'll go through more questions per day, so you'll probably earn more than an average person. But if Carol was 90% done with her degree and never passed the bar or got certified for anything, she can make nearly as much as you - as opposed to the nothing she makes now. The more clearly worded and unambiguous the questions, the better it will work. 
That's why I think it will compliment lawyers, not eliminate them. There will frequently be a need for human intelligence; the smart contract just specifies where it's needed. Think of it like [Mechanical Turk]( for legal contracts.

The thing that really worries me right now isn't arguing with core devs like Luke-Jr and Gavin who want a block size based on the average person's bandwidth limits and simply disagree about those engineering limits.
What worries me are the infinite block size supporters, who either don't understand bitcoin's scalability-decentralization limits or simply don't care. It's easy to support something that seems simple and quote Our Lord Satoshi and His infinite foresight. They'll point to how we currently trust miners who we can all watch and (if needed) replace, so it's OK to depend on big miners and just choose a corporation to watch miners for us.
It means saying goodbye to the enthusiast, goodbye to the tinkerer, goodbye to the economics crank, and goodbye to the hacker. Hello relying on big corporations to even WATCH the blockchain. Sure, ignore my post because it contains fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Because I'm honestly afraid that the bitcoin-using public misunderstands the threat to decentralization, uncertain they'll figure it out, and doubtful that they'd ever admit they took the wrong path.

It's still pure speculation on both our parts how this would work, so I doubt there's a "wrong" answer. I have three main reasons to doubt censorship:
1) Coordination. Who says what is a "white" market? The USA? There would probably be at least one payment processor per country, so you could bounce between multiple jurisdictions until you route to a black market.  Surely I could connect to a South African who connects to a Nigerian who connects to a Somalian.
2) Market preference for payment processors which don't censor. They could feasibly ignore public law over the darknet; since lightning is so low trust the exit scams would be inconsequential. If Coinbase/BitPay actually refused anyone who used mixers, they'd go out of business - privacy is important even to the innocent. 
3) Expected diversity of applications. When imagining the future or past it's natural to imagine something simple, but in reality it's always more complicated. We'll probably have bigger blocks and plenty of non-lightning transactions, sidechains, altcoins, grey markets, and other stuff we haven't thought of. They probably thought they could censor the internet too. No one thought WoW gold would be used for black market trades.

Merge mining can work with a sidechain or a compatible altcoin like Namecoin. The same miners do the same work, but it goes towards winning a block on both chains independently. If you're already going to mine bitcoin, then merged mining is nearly free. This doesn't require recording anything special in bitcoin, but the other chain needs merged mining support coded in.
This can work well with sidechains because a pool can mine many sidechains at once without additional cost to miners.

I'm certainly not claiming that anything is "easy", yelling at you, or making ad hominem attacks. I'm sorry that so many proponents of increasing the blocksize have been pushy and obnoxious, this has bothered me too.
For me at least, this "last time" is also the first time I've heard this Electrum server objection. If you're just completely fed up with explaining this to non-experts I'll understand, but if you don't mind my asking... are these higher server resources in terms of bandwidth, CPU, RAM, storage, all of the above? If lightweight client users are the beneficiaries of this hard work, could they feasibly pay their server operator? I use Mycelium on my phone and would be willing to pay for the convenience, but can't think of any robust way to reimburse full nodes for their service.
I'm legitimately interested in better understanding your opinion and coming to a consensus, even if it means I'm just plain wrong. Again, I'm sorry that you've been disrespected and don't like the "FORK NOW FORK NOW" panic either.

Hypothetical statement: "Will Augur/Truthcoin be available on a Bitcoin sidechain by December 2018?"
Since this technology benefits each of us tremendously, we'll each have a strong incentive to insure it will happen, and the Augur/Truthcoin teams can bet that it happens to scoop up the reward when finished. Imagine if we could bet on...
* Bitcoin price months/years after BIP100 or BIP101 get merged
* Environmental impact of proposed policies or anti-pollution initiatives
* Human life expectancy conditional on medical research being published
* Great works by our favorite artists being created and shared online under free licenses

"Wither away" is an interesting way to to describe a scenario in which bitcoin has become so popular that there's a bidding war for people to use it. This would be panic selling during a huge upswing in popularity. If you think bitcoin is just a crippled toy system right now without any changes, then I suggest you sell now and buy back if/when you think its value proposition has changed. Personally I would _speculate_ that the lowest-value uses of bitcoin (low-stakes gambling, small on-chain tips, non-bundled timestamps, etc) will be priced out first. But assuming that everyone will react the same way at the same time to similar incentives is the exact sort of thinking that brought us Keynesian "deflationary spirals".
I too am worried about a catastrophic doomsday scenario that would severely damage bitcoin - a hard fork where the network loses consensus, where merchants, payment processors, banks, and users argue over accepting each other's "real" bitcoins. That's a hellava lot scarier than fees going up.
Yes I support larger blocks, but I'm not willing to destroy consensus and support emergency dev powers because I'm scared that people will realize bitcoin isn't perfect.

"Will recreational cannabis be legalized in California?"
"Will sea levels rise in 2025 if Emissions Treaty Foo is signed?"
It could also feasibly have lower fees than centralized prediction markets, and it can safely grow large without having to worry about NSA hacks/threats. Obviously I'm a little biased but I'd rather trust a formula than a person. For big world-changing stuff my _life_ could depend on the outcome so I'd want to place a _huge_ bet without worrying about some site getting hacked or exit scammed or lawyered over the course of 20 years.

The lightning network isn't being pushed back by years; people invested in Bitcoin Cash have been spreading FUD about it. LN is already being tested on the main network and should be ready early next year.
The nodes have all the power already. Increasing the block size reduces how many people can run a node, thus concentrating power within a smaller group of people. This would make bitcoin easier to censor and thus worth less.
The power struggle is a _feature_ of bitcoin because it ensures we'll follow whichever path maximizes Bitcoin's value. If the market didn't think LN was right around the corner, then it wouldn't have rejected the recent doubling proposal. When it looks like everyone agrees, that's when you should worry.

You gotta go check out the stuff they're planning is IMHO pretty interesting.

Of course someone still needs to plan ahead and script it, so I see it more as an automation tool that lawyers could use than something that will replace them. 
Turing-complete smart contracts will eventually make their way to Counterparty or a sidechain too. None of this has materialized yet, it's vague and utopian... but I wouldn't scoff. Understanding both law and cryptocurrency might end up being very lucrative.

Miners don't increase fees when they're unprofitable; difficulty readjustment and strict competition ensure that their profits always tend to be very small. That's why fees didn't shoot up after a major bitcoin price crash like in 2011 or 2014. Fees and bitcoin price influence mining profitability but not vice versa.
Even with LN, if the block size isn't increased they will likely fill up anyways. Most miners support it because they'll profit more from a bitcoin exchange rate increase than they would from a fee increase. Even if we had infinite block space, LN would be helpful for its secure instant settlement.

If the acquisitions are frictionless, you can hold as little bitcoin as your risk aversion allows. Even if you're satisfied with the quality of service from credit cards, more competition will lower fees.
I'm assuming people will respond to incentives, nothing fancy. Sure, there are some people who will fish for problems because they hate being wrong, but those on the margin will adopt one at a time and sweeten the deal for everyone after them.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:23:43
IMO it's kinda a shitty thing to do, even though it's technically allowed. It relies on trusting a central party to manipulate the market. It's tearing down someone else's (admittedly pathetic) project instead of focusing on our own.

@_date: 2018-05-11 16:19:01




These two scenarios don't take place at the same time. Right now we have that growth because adoption is low, and as a result it's terrible for lending. IFF we have full international adoption, then the price will be much more stable, and the only loans that won't happen anymore are the ones expected to produce below-average returns. 
Right now slightly below-average investments (less loss than inflation) are encouraged. I'm not sure how much that actually helps because one can reliably get a good return by investing in a mutual fund, and mutual funds will likely outperform bitcoin once it's saturated. You can either watch your purchasing power go up ~4%/year parked in bitcoin, or ~5%/year in mutual funds.

_Why_ they're hoarding doesn't change anything, but I can think of two social benefits off the top of my head:
* Reduced consumption of scarce resources with that money leaves more for others and preserves the environment.
* Reduced circulating supply relative to demand raises the price so everyone else has more purchasing power while you wait to collect yours.
The value isn't wasted or frozen; it's "lent" out to everyone else.

Because it's not because someone **thought** of the idea, like you pretended I said. It's because pay to surf has been tried and failed.


That part isn't a business model; literally any cryptocurrency can support that. It doesn't require your token.


There are adblockers that handle it better too. What's stopping anyone from including Brave's filter lists?


I'm a long time bitcoiner who actually does use alts on occasion, which is why I've seen hundreds of scams just like yours. But my experience is irrelevant, this is about Brave/BAT.


"This time it's different" doesn't help if the underlying arms race problem remains.


No it's not. It was 100% pre-mined and runs on Ethereum.
Even pretending it is; centralization is why alternative currencies failed, but it's _not why pay to surf failed_. You've got to solve the arms race, not censorship.


Are you talking about the free rider donations? Literally any other cryptocurrency can do that.


I appreciate that _now_ you've at least tried, but those differences aren't accurate and don't solve the problems that made it unviable last time.


I'm talking about both because Brave depends on BAT, and they make their advertising revenue from Brave's users. But please, continue your discovery of what a strawman argument means.

1) You can secure any number of backups from physical theft by encrypting your wallet - I do this myself. If for whatever reason you want to trust someone else to hold your money, you can have multiple entities vote on where it goes instead of having to pick just one (P2SH). This is a far cry from bills stuffed under one's mattress.
2) The constant need for credit in today's society is a symptom of inflation. Lending/borrowing bitcoin are both terrible ideas right now and will probably stay that way for a long time.
3) This has nothing to do with trust, other than "trusting" math and economics to continue working.
4) In this hypothetical future where people are rational and omniscient, we wouldn't need money at all. We'd just think about how much someone had contributed to society while deciding to help them.

In many cases, we SHOULD be able to solve a lot of externalities/tragedies with assurance contracts or prediction markets.
The main barrier is transaction costs: 
Since Bitcoin can reduce or eliminate a lot of these transaction costs (fees, inflation-related opportunity costs, regulations, fraud, etc) this anarchist utopia seems more plausible every day. 
Eventually it might handle externalities so much more efficiently than democracy that this argument will be reversed - "how can you defend a state that protected polluters for so long, that allowed such widespread environmental devastation?"

Let's say each channel is a synapse. 
* There are [about 100 trillion]( of those in a human brain. 
* Conservatively estimating no new tech (channel factories, sidechains, etc),
* Liberally estimating [100% segwit adoption for 12195 tx/block]( and
* Each LN transaction is about twice as big as a typical on-chain transaction
* Everyone keeps all their channels open indefinitely
That comes out to...
100,000,000,000,000 / (12195 * 0.5 * 6 * 24 * 365) = 312,027 years
So I think we'll need more scaling before we can realistically approach that level of complexity.

If that sum sounds inconsequential to you, then you ought to ask a real life poor person if $30,000 would significantly improve their life. 
If you care most about wealth equality, then look no further than recent history. Deflation ended with the Bretton Woods system, and ever since wealth inequality has only gotten worse. The banking system has been taking advantage of how mandatory it is.
But why wealth equality? Why should we care about relative wealth instead of actual purchasing power? What matters is that the poor have enough money to buy the necessities of life. Let the rich get a tan on their robot yachts for all I care, if the workers building those yachts can earn better lives than they have now.

I respect your opinion but disagree with the Homestead Principle. In particular, when homesteading one is depriving others of natural resources that were shared up until that point. 
So if there's a ~~river~~ lake in the wilderness that we can both drink from, and then you build a fence around it and charge admission, then I'd say I'm worse off than if the resource was never privatized. You can arguably make better use of the ~~river~~ lake by doing so, but I should still be reimbursed for all the water I can't drink. This does not justify punishing good results beyond the loss of natural resources, so I too disagree with taxes on man-made structures.
Edit: switched to a resource with fewer externalities for clarity

Excellent question!
Every time you make a deposit, Coinbase would have to give you a signed receipt of its value. Then when it's time to audit Coinbase, all users posts their receipts and these are tallied up. When you want your coins back, you sign over the receipt so Coinbase can prove they were returned. If (total receipts - returned receipts) &gt; (total BTC held), then Coinbase is doing fractional reserve banking.
This would be very time-consuming if done manually, so I'm personally pushing for more Open-Transactions adoption so the issuing and verifying of these receipts can be easily automated. IMHO all centralized digital cash servers should use [Chaumian blinded tokens]( to protect customer privacy while still verifying liabilities. 
Right now BTC transaction fees are so low that it's not a big deal (low demand for audits), but I think someday the fees will be higher and we'll NEED payment processors (like Coinbase) for small purchases. That's where OT comes in - these servers become the VISA to Bitcoin's "Fed". Except this time, it's all verifiable.

Correct; increasing the block size alone only buys us time. We'll eventually need more advanced scalability tricks like "sidechains" which are still in development. This would have each miner merge-mining bitcoin with at least one other sidechain, similar to altcoins today but with a 1=1 fixed exchange rate to bitcoin.

Not Litecoin or Ethereum, they have their own hash algorithms. It's cheaper for Bitcoin holders to agree on a PoW fork than for miners to buy new hardware.

A soft fork is when the rules become more restrictive, a hard fork is when they become less restrictive. Since "maxblocksize = largerlimit" would be invalid under the existing rules, we'd be less restrictive to allow it - a hard fork.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:57:57
Blocksize limits aren't just for miners; it's so a typical home connection can run Bitcoin Core, even over Tor. There would be even greater resistance to a hard fork which sacrificed censorship resistance for lower fees.
If a competing chain wants to provide 1 GB blocks, let them - if you're not worried about censorship resistance then you can just use off-chain transactions anyways.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:14:32
Not stupid, you guessed correctly with dedicated servers. When you download Bitcoin Core you're running a "full node" server that downloads and verifies the entire blockchain and shares it with peers. "Lightweight clients" connect to a full node and only download the data they need.
That's why it takes so long to sync when you first install Bitcoin Core - you're downloading every bitcoin transaction ever. "Sidechains" would be more like floating pieces since not every full node would verify everything; just the overall money supply and a share of the total traffic.

I'm all for increasing the block size, but until all of the externalities are internalized, as a holder I'd prefer forks which limit them.

Paycoin is a fraud. (If you disagree, stop here)
The problem with facilitating fraud is that it makes it easier for less-informed people to fall victim to fraud, and it makes legitimate cryptocurrencies look equivalent to fraud. The industry should be policing itself and shunning these criminals.
If a decentralized exchange allows the user to trade arbitrary widgets (OpenBazaar, Coinffeine), then adding coin-specific code would be futile. Going out of their way to code in support for a specific scam would be a big red flag to not run that code. It's like when Evolution admins ran off with deposits, and everyone played the world's smallest violin for people who lost money on a site that helped sell fraudulent credit cards.

Possibly irrelevant anecdote, if you've already factored in node quality:
At least for me, a big part of it was better software came out and I learned how to use it. In 2011 I usually had a full node on my smartphone(!) and my desktop. The smartphone was a lousy node that wasn't really helping the network but I didn't know better. Whenever I withdrew from long-term savings, I restored a wallet.dat to a full (hot!) node on a live-booted Linux laptop. This was online infrequently so it too was a lousy node.
Now I know better and use Mycelium and Armory. The desktop stays connected but the only private keys that are hot are in my phone. I'm sure there are more newbies now to offset my own improvements, but at least some of us have been more focused on running one _good_ node.

If you want to help bitcoin, ask an average person why they don't use it yet. Then comes the hard part - you need to _actually listen_, not argue, and think of ways to address those concerns. We don't need more promotion, we need bitcoin literally for grandmas. No, relying on tech savvy millennials won't cut it.
This is where someone screams "Trezor!" But the truth is it isn't easy enough for the average computer illiterate yet, and price stability must grow organically with people's confidence. It's a chicken/egg problem and will take time.

You make all good points. I think right now we're seeing a situation with crowdfunding where people are indeed free riding, especially when it's difficult to estimate one's expected benefit and the likelihood that the threshold will be met. If you gain more value from a public good than most, then it would be rational to make your pledge sooner.
For your example: assuming public roads and insufficient traffic lights, everyone nearby (grocery store included) would have to evaluate how much the light is worth for themselves. If the light is only barely worth it, then the light will only be paid for once everyone has pledged. If it provides way more value than the cost, then the people who benefit most will probably pay for free riders. This isn't too terrible because everyone still ends up better off.
But there are also serious limits to how democracy would fund this, tied to transaction costs. Deciding which candidates/policies benefit you, voting tactically based on each candidate's chance of winning, and then monitoring their progress to make sure they aren't selling you out are all very costly. In practice many people don't even perform these calculations and just vote for "their team".
I spent years trying to improve my country's election and voting systems, but got practically nowhere. Very few people are willing to sacrifice short-term controversial issues in order to vote in an upgrade to the system itself. But in the last few years the progress in decentralized financial markets has been amazingly fast. I feel like I could Kickstart a traffic light far more easily than I could acquire signatures for one.

I disagree. Businesses can use it regardless of price because they usually sell immediately. In 2014 we saw awesome merchant adoption but a long price crash. I think long-term savings and quantity of transactions are what increase its value.

We might be talking about different things.

I'm not sure it's even possible for FRB to predate central backing; the asset is what's being fractionally reserved. [Wikipedia seems to agree]( but please correct me if I'm wrong...

You offer to help pay for something, but only if enough other people make the same offer for it to actually happen. 
So if Bitsquare needs 120 bitcoins to hire a programmer, you and 119 other people can each offer an average 1 bitcoin. If you want you can offer more or less, and if you feel like it's taking too long to fund all 120 bitcoins you can take yours back. Once the Lighthouse has all 120 bitcoins, the programmer gets paid.
This is good for things that help everybody, because otherwise you'd be smart to just wait for someone else to pay for it instead. If everybody waited like that, then we'd all be sad because there wouldn't be enough things that help everybody. So Lighthouse speeds up the creation of nice things we share.

Could be automated off-chain, or give ample time to match the highest bid. You can be screwed by not renewing your Namecoin domain right now.


You don't scam your customers yourself because the net present value of their future business outweighs the potential gains from scamming them right now. Since the scammer can't gain more value from the domain than you can, it stands to reason that you would outbid them. 
In the unlikely event a scammer decides to lose a vast amount of money with an excessive bid, you could still warn your customers and inform them of your new domain after open bidding has closed but before the domain changes hands. In this respect it's similar to a 51% attack - possible, but unprofitable.

I hear what you're saying, and definitely support a basic income so that everyone has a chance to enter and participate. ID systems like this make it much more feasible to automate, and assurance contracts like Lighthouse fix the market failure that prevents laissez-faire charity from funding it. We all benefit from less poverty because it reduces crime and allows folks like you to take more classes and contribute more in the long run.
But the notion of leveling out income inequality is what seems overly idealistic to me. Even if it didn't weaken the incentive for highly-productive people to work harder, it would create a "race to the bottom" that draws so many brilliant people to capitalist countries in the first place. Not everyone earns their income fair and square, but that's a reason to attack the unfair methods of exploitation, not high income in general.

I'm disappointed that you read that and dismissed it as slippery slope FUD rather than a genuine concern about feedback. In case I was being unclear, the mechanism behind this "[slippery slope](  is that a p2p system is governed by the rules set by peers, and once the only peers are businesses it's unlikely that they'll change something to benefit smaller businesses or consumers. They'll only have an incentive to optimize the utility (and influence) of people who are still peers.
One can have valid uncertainty and doubts about illogical arguments that "normal people shouldn't be nodes" while still supporting a larger block. I'm just saying you should support it because it's a size we can handle, not because we can safely give up control. To me, that's the FUD, it's like saying "oh block size increases are OK because the rich will represent our interests anyways".

For many people, this is 100% true. The advocate must recognize that bitcoin isn't for everyone yet. For example there aren't that many bitcoin discounts from vendors, and it's still too hard to use to gain most of the automation benefits for bills.

Something I've been thinking about, with regards to reversible transactions in the event of user error: wouldn't it fall prey to [adverse selection](
Right now your credit card covers two types of risk - the risk that you'll mess up (pickpockets) and the risk that the merchant will mess up (database hacks). Everyone wants credit card chargebacks because no matter how good you are with your card number, the vendor can leak it.
So if push-based systems eliminate the consumer's risk from DB hacks and the fee is 3%, everyone with less than 3% on average lost due to user error switches to irreversible systems. Now the average remaining person using this insurance loses more than 3%, and the rate has to go up, causing a death spiral.
The fluctuation in BTC/USD is irrelevant because you can just use Tether or colored coins to gain the technical benefits of bitcoin without the macroeconomics.

We tend to think of Bitcoin as the first and neglect all the digital gold currencies. If Bitcoin is ever replaced, cryptocurrency as we know it will be thought of the same way; missing some crucial element that seems obvious in hindsight.
But if we invent a better method, will it catch on faster with a new money supply (and the associated volatility), or as a hard fork of Bitcoin?

SHA256 will probably break gradually over time, allowing us to set a future block for the transition. Since mining hardware goes obsolete quickly anyways, with enough advance notice miners might not lose much money.
If it breaks all at once, then it's only a question of whether or not Bitcoin wants to die with it.

In the short run, the contract would need to specify who exactly pays the interest, but it's theoretically possible.
In the long run, when bitcoin reaches market saturation and the supply is near 21m, deflation will "pay interest". This has interesting applications in prediction markets that resolve decades later, like "sea levels to be 10cm higher by 2100-01-01".

After a quick Googling, it looks like their TOS limits liability to $100 for punitive damages, which is a different thing from deposit insurance and [has led to confusion]( Since then they've reasserted that [their insurance covers 100% of deposits]( That seems reasonable to me, since it would cost me more in time/stress to sue them than I'd get back - I just want the money back in my account without legal action if they get hacked. If someone has better sources, please do me a huge favor and point out how wrong I am.
That being said, I'm using common sense and not trusting more than a week's deposit to _any_ bitcoin exchange... There's no need. Anyone with a use case for thousands of dollars in an easily-accesible wallet can/should pay for a Trezor. Personally I've been a Linux fanatic for longer than I've been a Bitcoin fanatic and have been performing an arcane ritual for my rare cold storage withdrawls, but think I might buy a Trezor once they support multisig.

Right now it costs less than a penny to register a .bit, and only the transaction fee to renew. This hasn't deterred domain squatters from taking many of the best names, including names that already "belong" to corporations that we'd want to promote its adoption.
IMHO I interpret this as an [economic rent]( problem, but [the idea has never really caught on]( and I don't have the skill to code an alternative myself. Until someone else agrees that this _is_ a problem I don't see much point in paying someone to write a DNS protocol that only I want.

Ok I'm sure someone must have suggested this already, but what about a credit/debit card backed by bitcoin?
* We don't have to worry so much about a crackdown against bitcoin nowadays, especially if the card issuer cooperates with law enforcement
* Exact same fraud risk, same 3% fee
* Ability to chargeback
* Main difference is backing by bitcoin, similar to European travelers in the United States
* Private deposit insurance similar to Circle
* Still would suffer from volatility, but user could select a percentage of holdings as fiat with a slider bar on the website to balance purchasing power stability with monetary base stability
Personally I'd rather keep using real bitcoin, but this might help make the transition easier for people on the fence - the Bitcoin card for people interested in the economics, Tether for people interested in the technology.

Sometimes I go back to bitcointalk and reread the old discussions from before "recent unread topics" would make your eyeballs explode - that was my old front page. I still see some of those old handles around here, but miss many of them.
A little while ago I read a post from Magicaltux expressing the same nostalgia, and a part of me feels sorry for him that he can't rebuild that camaraderie now. This is one of the few places on the internet where I don't get laughed off the page for being a libertarian singulatarian bitcoiner. Kinda puts into perspective what's important.

@_date: 2015-01-02 03:00:04
I agree, and that's why I've recently resumed saving more bitcoin for the first time in years (had been just replacing). I'm not kicking myself for not buying more way back when because it seemed much less certain to me at the time.
At this point I'm confident that this is actually going to work, and what's uncertain is the timeline of growth and what specific use cases will appeal to typical consumers first. The global crackdown I once feared isn't going to happen, the crypto won't weaken faster than we can fork it, long-term volatility is going down, and I've experienced a few cycles of euphoric rapid bulls and excruciatingly slow bears.
But I'm still no better at out-thinking the market. I don't know where the bottom will be - maybe we're there or maybe we'll lose another 75% in 2015. I just know that the coins I'm buying now are still significant relative to my already-existing savings, and that the fundamentals are strong.
_My point:_ don't wait for a specific price, start dollar cost averaging now. Huge buys and sells at the bottom and top are for people smarter than me.

@_date: 2016-01-04 12:28:52
Sorry to nitpick, but going by what people are using (which _causes_ a high hash rate) is much better than going by hash rate itself. Hash rate is just an arbitrary number relative only to other people hashing the same thing.
Security can be a slippery goal - if I'm going to secure funds, I'm going to pick the chain with a secure social contract (like 21M max) first and a high hash rate second. Alts work fine.

Yep you've successfully trolled me.
Before I heard about Bitcoin, I was struggling to fix [my country's broken government]( particularly with liquid democracy and cryptography. For example [I promoted delegated voting systems]( and voting system reform for years. I campaigned for Nader in 2008 because of the exploitative two-party system; Nader was the biggest candidate who supported [clone-independent voting]( in the form of Instant-Runoff Voting (he stood against the bailouts too, btw). I was a huge fan of [Robin Hanson's Futarchy]( but could barely even get started because prediction markets were heavily censored, and I couldn't reconcile their potential for [feedback]( (because the government would control these markets and issue their money). So when the [Wikileaks financial blockade]( led me to Bitcoin, I saw hope.
I didn't get paid for any of this and knew there was a microscopic chance of victory. But I had no choice - there's nowhere to run and no point in giving up just to be a slave until I die. Now guys like you tell us that we got those cheap bitcoins for "free". A million ideas just like mine were doomed to failure. You don't know how many weird ideas I've lost sleep over, out of desperation for something resembling justice. All you see is the idea that worked.
_This isn't over and I'm not going to give up_, no matter how much pettiness, condescension, and cruelty I have to endure. Everything the new users are going through now, I've been there and if they're anything like me they won't just give up either.

I think it's to make trading bitcoin easier for wealthy investors who use traditional exchanges. That's why a lot of people think "moon" when they see progress on this.
Simply holding a bitcoin isn't enough to track the price. All my bitcoins are worth one bitcoin each, and up until recently I'd been approximating their dollar value using Bitstamp alone (!) so a more robust algorithm would be very helpful.

And segfault "alone" is a strangely one-sided comparison anyways. If the SPV server you trust doesn't update _their_ software, then they'll view _any_ hard fork as invalid. Or they can adopt your software ahead of time, so that SPV users can enjoy more blocks like the one linked above.

In the long run I hope that we can decide most forks with prediction markets instead of miner activation; it would change from "what miners support" to "what is expected to be valuable long-term", which are different things when we factor in the expected obsolescence of any given ASIC.

Let me try: a problem for which the hard fork solution has less total cost to participants than the soft (or "evil") alternative. For example the cost of hard fork segwit is so high that the soft fork version is better unless we're already hard forking anyways.
I'm not sure which is cheaper - a hard fork or an evil soft fork.

Your wallet would keep its balance on both forks, and one of them would likely crash in value. I expect the winner would hold its value because hardfork risk is already priced in.

That's the thing, though... so long as 1% of miners still support the old chain, difficulty retargets will ensure you eventually get valid blocks to accept. 
No promises about exchange rate, though. Just because no one can force you to change the rules to which you agree, doesn't mean they have to go along with you.

They're asking for a compromise, supporting BU, and stating that their issue here is the threat to fee revenue, NOT a concern about insufficient scaling. Maybe the big blockers asking for Segwit+2MB(non-witness) _aren't_ representative of the miners... Maybe the compromise Core could offer is miner voting on block size _within_ existing acceptable limits solely to protect the fee market?
We (the users) could give the miners a way to protect their income, retain some power, and save face... And in return, we get the 2nd layer _and_ reliable funding for security that won't drop every time scaling is upgraded. I don't want another UASF debate when Schnorr comes out, or when we HF to 17%/yr or whatever.

If I were to venture a guess, I would say p2p sidechains. Options include but are not limited to:
* Extension blocks only. Best security, but extremely limiting. Only Mimblewimble in the near future.
* Drivechain, miners have a huge amount of power and hopefully won't shoot themselves in the foot by abusing it. Bitcoin Hivemind helps us coordinate on future upgrades, potentially replacing BIP9.
* zk-SNARKs, very complicated to code, with much less power for miners as we know them.

Unless you pay someone else who also has a path to your LN node, or close the channel.

I'm not sure I do understand. Consensus is technically subjective and requires human intelligence to evaluate, which really upsets a lot of computer types who want clear and easy yes/no answers. This past year we've seen a lot of people angrily demand a formal definition of consensus, as if it will be spelled out unambiguously in code and not itself be weaseled to death by internet lawyers.
This difficulty in recognizing widespread agreement by humans doesn't justify redefining "consensus" to mean something easier and cleaner. I'm not defending the claim that 60% of devs are consensus (IMHO they aren't), I'm attacking the claim that miners alone decide consensus.

Assuming Core gets the community behind a UASF, soft forking segwit away would be a 51% attack. With a community that just coordinated an out of band fork, the stage would be perfectly set for a PoW fork next.

Very few people are actually advocating an end to on chain scaling. Segwit

B) _Whose_ 51% attacks? Miners will go out of business until profits are barely positive again. Even if 90% of miners go out of business because fees/subsidy are "too" low, the remaining 10% still have the same incentive to mine honestly. The ASIC ended the threat of external 51% attacks; an ASIC is useless for anything but mining bitcoin, and anything that isn't an ASIC is useless for mining bitcoin.
We're extremely fortunate that Satoshi picked a halving period long enough to heavily subsidize mining until we got to where we are today. If it didn't break bitcoin's social contract, I'd suggest we could lower the subsidy right now.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:27:31
I wouldn't consider headers-only mining to be a 51% attack because miners aren't coordinating on any extra rules or censoring anything - they're acting unilaterally. If we aren't willing to pay enough fees, then we aren't entitled to that space.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:55:43

@_date: 2015-05-17 17:01:21
Basically, here's the problem...
When you make a transaction, everyone else has to download it. This means if the limit were raised too high, it would be too much data for everyone and we'd need to rely on big businesses like VISA, and we'd be right back to square one.
So right now everyone in bitcoin is arguing whether or not it's a good idea to raise the limit to be 20x higher. It would reduce how many people are sharing the data, but _arguably_ not so much that we'd be easily controlled like VISA. It also wouldn't completely solve the problem; it would just allow for 20x more growth while we work on better solutions.
The better solutions (like [sidechains/treechains]( and the [lightning network]( need more time to be written and tested. This could take years, and IMHO part of the reason the exchange value has been dropping despite improved merchant acceptance over the past year.
So buying bitcoins right now is still very much a bet - will these better solutions be invented, or will bitcoin remain an "alternative" forever?

3. Theymos allows us to promote them (j/k)

You're right, I misunderstood you.




I'm actually a _huge_ fan of the extension block approach you describe, particularly since I'm not the one who would have to code it. IMHO it would be best if we never hard forked except for PoW forks when absolutely necessary, and if we're concerned about complexity or technical debt we should plan a forced soft fork instead of (or after multiple) extension blocks. Ideally I'd love to see an [onion model]( Bitcoin, where each big change is another extension block embedded within the previous one. Out-of-date clients still wouldn't be able to watch everything going on in the new ruleset (like a hard fork) but they'd at least still be using the same money supply (unlike a hard fork).
I think that once there's a consensus to increase the block size, that's precisely how we should do it. That being said, a soft fork without consensus is a 51% attack - in this case, 51% of miners would be requiring that the 49% download and validate 8MB blocks, which might be bad for small miners. It's just a particularly mild 51% attack that barely starts to nudge out the competition. Something like that might be better suited for a user-activated version of the SF^2 you describe; prohibiting the extension block transactions and hoping that the exchanges agree if the miners don't.

Picking a metric to approximate consensus doesn't make it a safe assumption, we've seen that already with BIP66. I'm not claiming this is safe; I'm still on the fence about UASFs to circumvent miners myself... It seems barely any safer than a hard fork.
We'd need lots of time, and lots of discussion, to make it abundantly clear that we have consensus. IMHO, it's the lack of rational objections to an idea.

[WARNING: contains straw men!]
One recurring pattern I've noticed with BU adherents is that they keep repeating


They're trying to automate the whole decision-making process, not just the ordering of transactions. They'll follow with


This sounds intuitive, until you realize that miners are just maximizing their own income, which is heavily influenced by rapidly-depreciating hardware. The incentives don't line up.
Right now Core supporters are saying


You're right. This isn't going to stand the test of time and the principles we're discussing will be bullshitted away. They'll say we couldn't have possibly comprehended the wondrous world of the future, or that our ideas regarding our specific contribution are wrong because we believed in [common idea in 2017 that is repulsive in 2117]. We DO need to automate the decision-making process, but the first step isn't with miners - it's with markets. The synthetic BU futures are a start, but they're primarily on a centralized regulated exchange that got hacked recently. **For Bitcoin to survive, it needs [Hivemind]( to guide which rule changes make bitcoins worth more. Even that won't necessarily solve everything, but it'll make deciding a lot easier.

I'm actually really optimistic about and interested in the bitfinex synthetics right now. Maybe that's how we should decide forks - whichever is worth more. More exchanges should launch their own synthetics, especially if they have terms which the BU crowd finds more agreeable.
And before anyone jumps in and says "miners will maximize the value of the coin!", no not necessarily - there's a difference between the value of a coin and a miner's expected income over the life of their hardware. These synthetics reconcile the difference between holder and miner incentives.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:59:44
Because that's _a lot_ of extra work!
* Updating BU to support Segwit and everything else up to 0.14.0
* Allowing BU users to select either Compact blocks or Xthin blocks
* Creating a new version of Segwit which stores all of the data within 1 MB, which still allows for an upgrade to the existing version later
I don't know if the devs on either side have that much free time.

Fair enough, assuming they have reason to believe conditions might improve. 


Right, but they'd be wrecking themselves just as hard... That's why I said their _incentive_ is to be honest. Ghash.io could have tried that once too.


I'd figure you would want to make a few hundred grand back by using it honestly.
I forgot to mention, as a backup to these incentives, a 51% attack would probably be countered by a PoW hard fork, and we could reward honest
 miners with assurance contracts. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:59:14
I don't think so. In addition to competitive hash rates, they'll need competitive latency too - this raises the barrier to entry because all miners pay the same internet costs regardless of hash power.

This guy gets it. Prohibiting standard transactions is a world of difference from prohibiting non-standard transactions.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but the only time bitcoin-qt ever did this was OP_EVAL because it was a big security risk to the chain. Gavin appears to view this situation similarly, even though BU can defend itself with reorg protection.

If it gets &gt;50% of miners, then it becomes the only Bitcoin like a typical BIP9 soft fork.
If it gets &lt;50% of miners, then it splits off but leaves the original chain alone.

They're proposing the former; public discussion. FWIW pseudonyms are allowed, although I can understand that might not be good enough for everyone.
I like the PoS idea, though... Interesting food for thought. Having everyone sign messages might expose too many ECDSA keys, requiring on-chain transactions with special bits might get too expensive, and both are a huge burden on holders.
We need decentralized prediction markets already!

They already did. The original segwit idea didn't include a block size increase, and 2 MB followed by observation was the first step suggested by Bitcoin Classic. Let's assume for a moment that Core compromises a second time because it would be politically convenient. What would be the compromise:
* extension blocks for more MB with a somewhat less traditional soft fork, 
* a forced soft fork for HF-like code simplicity but still _technically_ a soft fork, or
* a "compromise" block size increase by hard fork, which is just what most of r/btc has been asking for all along.
Based on what I've read on both subs it appears the compromise they're asking for is basically Bitcoin Classic, but with twice the initial block size (2 MB --&gt; 4 MB).

The issue I'm having with the miners is that they haven't clearly articulated why "segwit first, collect data, propose HF" is unreasonable. It's like arguing with one's significant other and they say "you should KNOW why I'm mad". So far I've seen two plausible explanations:
* Miners still expect the HK agreement _plus some_ (2MB non-witness and segwit _at the same time_), even though they mined blocks which were not compliant to Core consensus, and the devs present weren't authorized to make promises on everyone else's behalf.
* Enabling 2nd layer scaling may reduce on-chain fees in the short term, and a rise in price before the voting miners' hardware is obsolete is not a given.
I wish Jihan would publish, in his own words, what his objection to "segwit first" is and why. Not a retweet or more r/btc people speaking on his behalf. If he's mad about a broken deal that never bound the vast majority of us, then we shouldn't care. If he's got an objection to segwit itself relating to an expected cut in security funding, then we should care. If a whole bunch of miners go out of business at once, then there'll be a lot of ASICs for sale that states might be more inclined to buy at a slight loss.

Everyone who thinks a UASF has anything to do with node count or voting is completely misinformed at best, and spreading misinformation deliberately at worst.
The miners voting are not "the market deciding". They're only a part of the market, our employees. They're not optimizing the long term value of Bitcoin - they're optimizing the value of Bitcoin within the life of their hardware, heavily biased towards the closer end.
The decision of whether or not to UASF IS made by consensus, just like every other change to Bitcoin. No I will not redefine a dictionary word as C++ for you. No I will not prefix "Nakamoto" to simplify it and appeal to authority. You have to actually think about this yourself with your own brain, and decide if there are any valid arguments from the anti-SegWit first camp. If a fork does happen, the real market will decide, and they will pick whichever fork is more valuable. If we're forced to hard fork, then this will happen anyways.

Ultimately the users running a UASF are making a bet: that in the event of a persistent fork the speculators will side with them, and that miners know it. It's not asking the miners opinion anymore, but instead calling the miners bluff and asking them to put their money where their mouths are.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:13:30
Remember [this megatransaction]( In addition to regular users rationally following incentives as a group, a malicious miner can further bloat the UTXO at a disproportionately low cost to himself. He'd either consume everyone's memory while it's unspent, or slow down rivals validating his block when it gets spent. Higher fees make this sort of attack more expensive now, but high fees aren't a very good solution either. 
I acknowledge that FlexTrans fixes quadratic hashing of sighash operations too, but it doesn't address UTXO bloat. If we were to hard fork to a higher base block size and FlexTrans,  then we'd have something similar to segwit but this attack vector would become cheap again.
TL;DR: Segwit reduces UTXO bloat _on purpose_ to make increasing the block size _safer_. We can raise it even more with segwit than we could without.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:49:18
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:13:35
I don't think it allows that but (correct me if I'm wrong) it exposes your ECDSA public key, which is about as safe as address reuse.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:33:41
Without nodes enforcing the limits, it's a prisoner's dilemma - miners as a whole would make more money if the block size was smaller, but each one benefits individually from defecting and making a big block. It's why the soft limits collapsed once they had any significant fee pressure.

I don't think Bitcoin should be like governments or silly apps. Most of those applications don't require universal compatibility. Just because something is natural/normal doesn't make it desirable, and soft forks are normal for Bitcoin anyways.
Bitcoin can scale on chain in this way, like with segwit and extension blocks. This _hastens_ progress because a soft fork can activate faster than a safe hard fork will.
I don't think it's dumb to empathize with other people's feelings, especially when consensus is important. FWIW the people I'm most concerned about are casual users who'll get angry if it stops working, but conservative power users matter too.

It only forces them to accept one soft fork that the community wants but miners don't want. If they're willing to attack the network, then miners could enforce a soft fork that _they_ want but the community _doesn't_ - a 51% attack. For example they could start censoring any blocks which contain segwit transactions, thus preventing a minority chain split with which they disagree.
IMHO this would be a last resort before a PoW hard fork, and we all need to think really hard about if we're ready to push that button. We might even want to have a few PoW hardfork nukes ready to launch before flag day.

All non-mining nodes. End users, merchants, exchanges, etc.


Treating them what way? The miners broke the agreement by running Classic, and the dev signers can't compel the rest of Core to agree to a change.


The subject line of this thread discusses increasing the block size in 2017. The research so far says up to 4 MB is safe, so it's prudent to increase it with segwit and then collect new data before increasing it even more. If you're getting harsh replies about this, it's because this has been discussed at great length already.

When you're manufacturing something, you need much more than instructions and a design. You need to understand it and be able to troubleshoot it. It's a struggle to document as much as possible even when you're trying to, and very difficult to copy a design without making a piece of total garbage. Reverse engineering is not easy.
FWIW I'm a manufacturing engineer and dislike patents/copyright so much that I work in an industry that relies mostly on trade secrets. I'd much rather sign an NDA and get paid a salary that makes me scared to break it, than be subject to the minefield that is patents. Maybe lawyers have an easy time looking this stuff up, but for actual engineers it's virtually impossible and this has a high cost to society. There are rarely clear lines between ideas.

I'm not sure what this has to do with my post, but OK...
Although different people interpret consensus in different ways and I can't speak for them, I use a [Wikipedia-style approach](


(emphasis mine)
Since anyone can create unlimited sockpuppets, or make unlimited poor arguments, and because appealing to the authority of established devs is irrational groupthink, I evaluate consensus by the existence of legitimate concerns. So if someone doesn't know what they're talking about and makes an invalid criticism, it doesn't change my perception of consensus. There's a scientific consensus on the Earth being round despite the existence of flat-Earthers. We might still have a conversation about the earth's flatness despite the existence of such a consensus. It's not unanimity; my ignorance is not just as good as your knowledge.
There's no way out of using our own brains to evaluate these arguments. If we allow any objections whatsoever, a single idiot could halt bitcoin. If we go by "Nakamoto consensus", then a PoW fork is forever impossible and there's no such thing as a 51% attack. If we just listen to established devs, then they'll just become a cabal. If we point to Satoshi's whitepaper, then we've just moved the fight to interpreting that, with no ability to evolve beyond it. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. In a worst case scenario, we'll have to trigger a fork (either hard or UASF) and put our money where our mouths are.

* If the alternative is indeed superior, then Bitcoin can copy it but use the Bitcoin UTXO set. Litecoin was briefly technically superior while it had segwit but Bitcoin didn't.
Edit: basically what I'm saying is that the only things that can kill Bitcoin are proofs that the basic concept can't work.

The "official" solution is to have everybody in the ecosystem talk about it and have the heavy hitters make a commitment. The exchanges, the big time holders, major bitcoin-accepting businesses, etc.
Personally I believe that [the investors control Bitcoin]( so the Bitfinex BU synthetics are a step in the right direction. Just as we're betting on how much synthetic BU are worth now, we should place our bets on how much potential segwit/non-segwit forks would be worth. If the market thinks a segwit Bitcoin will be worth more, then the miners probably won't even bother mining the non-segwit fork because it would just get wiped out anyways.






If we're defining support by the set of miners _after_ the change, then 100% of the miners running the BIP148 Bitcoin fork would support segwit too... Why are PoW changes different from other forks in this respect? I'm skeptical about how much money the dominant miners would be willing to lose on attacking "rival" chains which serve people who don't want to be the dominant miners' customers anymore.

Reading these comments, there are a lot of valid arguments. Enabling the 2nd layer will likely raise the price of BTC significantly and help miners. That being said, the author (and presumably Jihan) has a reasonable point. Improvements don't guarantee immediate increased adoption, especially within the rapidly-depreciating mining timeframe, and they will reduce the total number of bitcoins paid as fees in the short term.
I know we've heard a lot of unreasonable requests to compromise with dangerously high block sizes, and we've recognized them as unlikely to persuade BU miners. But please consider this compromise with an open mind:
We offer to **let miners vote on block weights** between 1,000,000 (approx 0.5 MB) and the maximum (currently 4,000,000, approx 2 MB). 
* Miners can't immediately increase fees unreasonably far beyond where they are now, and probably won't at all.
* Miners can cautiously increase block sizes in the short term while we're still on the 1st layer, and then possibly lower it back down as LN/Schnorr/etc are ready.
* If we're going to rely on fees as a long-term source of security funding, then that funding shouldn't be cut every time an efficiency upgrade is released.
* This adds more complexity to mining, but we can safely assume that they'll all want to maximize their revenue.
* The only reliable way to actually measure demand elasticity is to make changes to the supply. [There's a "sweet spot" of maximum revenue that miners will want to hit](
* We'll have plenty of time to plan a hard fork for larger maximum block sizes, perhaps something similar to Luke-Jr's recent proposal.
We want more decentralization, and we're willing to pay higher fees for it. I understand that we shouldn't allow ourselves to be bullied, that the users are in charge. Based on the Bitfinex synthetics and feasible PoW fork proposals, I'm confident that Core would win a Bitcoin nuclear war. But we don't need to let it come to this! If we have a chance to _defuse this situation_, we should take it!

I believe so. I can't speak for its supporters (still thinking about it myself) but I think their rationale is that it would only be merged once it has wide-ranging consensus (like Segwit), and with plenty of time to prepare. 
There is no intelligent opposition to Segwit at this point; just people who are either misinformed or who are using it as a bargaining chip. I'm confident that in the event of a fork, the Segwit branch would be judged as more valuable by investors, attract more miners, and eventually erase the HF branch with a huge chain reorganization.
Miners have more short-term incentives than holders do, and would be hurt much more by a crash which demolishes bitcoin's value for the life of their hardware. _I_ can't be driven out of business; I'll hold until it either crashes to 0 or reshapes the world.

It's possible that one of the reasons miners haven't activated segwit yet is because increasing the block size may actually _reduce_ their fee revenue per block. Although bitcoin users buy block space unilaterally, miners in version 0.13.1 are forced to coordinate on two options for almost completely inelastic supply - 1MB or 2MB. 
Shown here are two hypothetical demand curves - one present-day, and one at some point in the future if and when demand for space on the blockchain has increased. Mining revenue per block can be calculated by multiplying the X and Y values of each intersection point.
Because it's so difficult to estimate demand elasticity without real-life data and activation is irreversible, miners face an unknown risk to their fee revenue from activating.
This diagram ignores other factors involved in the activation decision, such as long-term reduced block space demand due to lightning networks, and an increase in the value of each bitcoin due to improved functionality.

Whether we like it or not, the general public does have a part. If it's a pain in the neck, then they'll stop accepting it and bitcoin's value will go down. If we want bitcoin to go mainstream, then we have to worry about angering restaurant owners.
If we agreed that we had made a mistake (as I've heard for P2SH vs OP\_CHECKHASHVERIFY, but more severe) or the technical debt and complexity grow too great, we _could_ do an evil fork to drastically change the rules and prohibit old standard transactions. But the UX consequences of that would be nearly as bad as a hard fork. That's part of why segwit is arguably the most tested upgrade in bitcoin history.

The block reward consists of two parts - subsidy and fees. The subsidy is going down, but total fees are going up. Fees paid _per user_ can go down while total fees _per block_ goes up if there are more users.
For what it's worth, both times the subsidy halved in the past  (from 50 to 25 and from 25 to 12.5), there were people really worried about miners going out of business. Both times the lower inflation raised the price, which canceled out the drop in subsidy. I suspect that if fees per user get really low, [then many more people will want to use it](
I think if total on-chain fees get too low to support mining, then we should consider letting miners vote on the block size below a safe maximum ("flexcap"). But that's the opposite of the problem we have right now, and it'll be a huge debate if it ever happens.

It's not the same as yelling in the street because the latter conveys far more information about who the speaker is and what they're saying. The Bitcoin whitepaper clearly describes how enhanced privacy is one of the project's aims. Since Monero now offers RingCT, do you view that any differently?
This proposal is akin to making it illegal to yell _in code_ on the street, because the government is entitled to know what you're saying.

The casual user isn't involved in this debate and done aren't even aware of it. We're power users.
A hard fork isn't a viable short term solution because the casual users who aren't aware end up on another chain, and can accidentally accept worthless "bitcoins". We've seen that minority chain persist with ETC, and despite the different difficulty adjustments it can still happen to Bitcoin.
If we urgently need bigger blocks, we can safely do that faster with an extension block soft fork.

No one is doing mental gymnastics. Regardless of whether or not you were referring to me... It sounds like you're lazily dismissing explanations because they haven't been simplified into a sound byte, and blaming the speaker because they didn't explain like you're five. There's a whole philosophy to open source, and Bitcoin is an extremely multidisciplinary topic. You don't seem to be putting in much effort to understand anyone else, yet keep repeating the same invalid and simplistic COI argument.
But let me try to summarize anyways... My goal _was_ to explain to you that no one here cares who writes the code and why, so long as whether or not it makes Bitcoin better. I don't believe Core is making a mistake about what and when to merge.

IMHO including flexcap might help. 
* Miners might think demand for transactions is [highly inelastic (like cigarettes)]( so increasing the quantity of transactions would reduce their fee revenue. Segwit is "the first flexcap vote".
* Miners might think demand for transactions is highly elastic (like iPhones), so they're holding out for the power to increase it &gt;70% as a negotiation tactic. Big increases can be done with extension blocks so no hard fork is required.
Would most of you be OK with flexcap? What if it had a growing upper bound equal to BIP101 or BIP103 so that miners couldn't vote each other out of business?

I agree with BinaryResult and Technom4ge's answers.

Those with low priority (disparaged as spammers) didn't get what they "needed".

The whole thing is hypothetical until it actually launches. :-D So I'm not strongly disagreeing, but have a couple notes:
* You aren't directly sending bitcoin to another party - it's relayed by nodes and included in a block by miners. Nodes don't charge you for this service right now; relying on altruism can eventually result in a market failure.
* One big hub can go offline, or be hacked. Because bitcoins must be held hot in order to run a LN node, their owners have a strong incentive to split them up between multiple servers/businesses to reduce their maximum possible loss. There's a diminishing marginal utility to held money, and a fixed utility increase to running your own node (earn fees, monitor for cheating, etc), so there's a medium node size towards which these market forces will converge. For a long time our BTC/USD exchange was centralized too.
I wouldn't call LN inferior to the blockchain - it's like saying the web is inferior to the internet. A LN transaction can never be more secure than the foundation on which it's built, but it can be faster and cheaper while nearly as secure. If you're not familiar with it already, you might want to check out [Drivechain]( it has security tradeoffs too (more trusting miners) but might be more in line with what you seem to prefer.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:45:06
Visibility on the blockchain won't scare off thieves - Bitcoin criminals just tumble them until they're practically impossible to trace.
Your security comes from having a potentially unlimited number of private keys, stored any possible way. If you're familiar with TrueCrypt, it's the same "plausible deniability" principle. The robbers won't know how many coins you have to extort.

Many forms of payment, like credit cards, can be reversed after the merchant has been paid. So if you agree to pay $20 at a restaurant and then they actually charge $100 to your card, you can call the credit card company and issue a "chargeback". This can sometimes be abused for fraud.
By default Bitcoin doesn't have this feature; it's more like cash or gold coins. If you want consumer protections, then you need to specify a middleman or payment processor to hold the money in escrow ahead of time. That's how apps like OpenBazaar work; the money is held in a "smart contract" until the buyer receives his order, and then he releases it to the seller. If there's a dispute, the arbitrator they selected decides who gets the money.
So like cash - once you've got it, it's yours.

Unofficial answer: there will be no voting, only betting on which fork is more valuable.
If Core releases a soft fork that no one wants because it makes Bitcoin worse, then no one will use it, a mining minority will guarantee a split, and it'll be slaughtered on the market.
If Core (or Shaolin Fry) releases a soft fork that people want because it makes Bitcoin better, then it would likely be the more valuable side after a split, so miners will coordinate to prevent the split from ever happening.

Reversibility [can be used to scam too]( It doesn't make sense to integrate it into the payment system. 
If you're buying from a brick and mortar store, then there's already a legal system in place to protect the consumer even if they pay with cash. Adding the possibility of chargebacks just increases costs. The goods they're giving me are irreversible, why shouldn't the money I'm giving them be irreversible too? Where they're allowed to do so, many businesses offer a cash discount.
If you're buying from some rando on the internet, then you can use escrow (like OpenBazaar) to protect you from fraud. You can select a big business like the credit card companies as the escrow, but also anyone else. The choice of escrow isn't tied to the payment system itself. If I'm buying MP3s and I want 1000 purchases over a year, then I don't need any consumer protection at all.
TL;DR: we can add reversible layers on top of an irreversible system, but not vice versa.

There's infinite demand for free transactions. Core users have allowed as much increase as can be done safely. Had the miners activated segwit promptly, fees would have been lower for months.

I noticed your good faith comments on the BU orphan thread and think I was too harsh to call you dishonest before. If you'll forgive that, I'd like to keep talking about this.
We both understand that individual participants need to know what they're buying for their own sake. A market can't function properly if most participants don't have reliable information - it's an information asymmetry which may cause market failure. The better information they have, the more they know they can rely on it, which makes the price more stable. I benefit from you having better information.
Each miner has a strong incentive to upload _recent_ blocks (especially their own) to all miners - including newcomers - so that it doesn't get orphaned. But what about last week's blocks? Those aren't going to get orphaned at this point, so there's no incentive to help bootstrap newcomers. Even if having more miners in the market improves bitcoin's value, this is still a positive externality - miners don't benefit as much personally by spending that bandwidth as they would if someone else did it.


This is only true up to a point. Strictly speaking, their incentive is to maximize the net present value of their mining operation, which requires continuous investment to keep producing bitcoins long-term. Examples:
* If a SHA256 vulnerability is found it might be better for us to switch hash algorithms, but this would be worse for existing miners than if we just kept using the slightly less secure SHA256. We'd need to hard fork without their permission.
* If demand for block space is inelastic, then increasing the blocksize [might actually reduce mining revenue in the short term]( but I think we'd agree that it'd increase the value of bitcoin in the long term.
I think this is part of why they've been very conservative, both with segwit and BU. They get punished much more for short-term disruptions than they get rewarded for long-term growth.

[Adam Back's explanation](
(What follows is just my opinion) 
I disagree that people worried about centralization could simply keep running the 1 MB version and not have to worry - the only way miners could stay competitive would be to validate everything. So the centralization risk remains, and we'd still need a strong consensus.
It would also be overcomplicating the UI to have the user decide which block to use; the extension plus the old 1 MB should add up towards a new combined limit (not separate like Adam proposed). Once miners signal 95%, all up-to-date wallets should just use the new blocks for everything. Invisible regardless of whether or not you've updated, except updating makes your fees go down.

But it's not just testing; after testing, _then_ everyone has to upgrade. If someone has a business built on bitcoin, then they won't have three months notice - they'll have (3-(testing time)) months notice.




I have two FUDs about this:
* We're engineering for adversarial conditions, not most likely typical conditions. We shouldn't defer to Luke's segwit usage prediction while simultaneously disregarding his recommended block size limits.
* If we only had hard forks on the table, then I'd probably agree on merging a 4MB fork with a long schedule. But we're already getting a significant increase next month, that's already been extensively tested and doesn't require that anyone rushing at all. That extra capacity could give us ample time to test the hell out of 2x, collect data on how segwit impacts decentralization, and still have plenty of time for everyone to upgrade.
I get that you've agreed to something, and you need to follow through with your end now that the miners have delivered theirs. But the rest of us only need to decide which chain is worth more. Segwit2x doesn't have [the best developers]( (no offense), it doesn't have a long enough schedule, and it solves a problem that's already getting addressed next month. We know this won't be the last block size fork for either side; even Segwit2x is more of a data collection fork before we get the "real" scaling hard fork - yearly percentage increases with wishlist items included. The future for Core is extensive testing, more soft-fork scaling with Schnorr signatures, and long upgrade windows. What's the future for Segwit2x after the hard fork?

Thanks, I was planning on doing (2) myself. What's the advantage of waiting for the tx to clear the mempools, as opposed to waiting for six confirmations?
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:24:14
In my opinion, yes. It prevents a compromised PC from giving up the private keys that are used to spend your bitcoins. Cold storage (like Bitcoin Armory) is slightly more secure but requires a deep understanding of computer security and can be cumbersome to use.
You can protect against paper wallet theft by adding a password (might forget), splitting up the words (requires more words), or using multiple signatures (complicated).
Personally I switched from Armory to Trezors so it'll be easier for my family to get the money if I die. Using the right secret words would be hard enough for them without added technical complexity. Usability is really one of the worst parts about Bitcoin right now.

This can be accomplished with soft fork extension blocks too.
The advantages of extension blocks: 
* Users aren't forced to choose between updating, losing money, or no longer accepting bitcoin.
* Can be safely rolled out much faster, since users can upgrade when ready.
The upsides of a hard fork: 
* If we screw up and need to revert it, this UX cost has already been paid.
* The code is simpler.
I've noticed that people who write code for other stuff tend to prefer the hard fork option, while people who code for Bitcoin _or who administer systems where forced updates can screw stuff up_ tend to prefer the soft fork option.

PoW hard forks don't require miner activation; you can just fork at a predetermined block height.

They can just make it closed-source and ignore your licensing requirements entirely. Let's say hypothetically the Federal Reserve wanted to create a cryptocurrency based on one that's currently GPL'ed. They'd just do it, and then publish the binaries. What are you going to do about it?
Even if they were worried about copyright; blockchain technology isn't patented. They could just take the concepts, write their own cryptocurrency from scratch, and publish that.
But the bottom line is that the law won't stop the people who are writing the laws. The difference between the GPL and MIT licenses is inconsequential in practice because only an idiot would use a closed-source coin that borrowed code from an open-source one.

That's not why most of us are running Core. Put simply it makes more sense to watch the impact of segwit's block size increase before scheduling another one, especially a hard fork in three months.
The miners do have a say; they and the other large blockers are why segwit increases the block size at all, doubling it like Bitcoin Classic wanted.
Having a say doesn't mean they get what they want even if it's unreasonably dangerous. If you're not "idealist" enough to refuse bad ideas from a majority hash rate, then you're ruled by a majority hash rate.

Almost all of us want another block size increase after segwit. The issues are that 
* we don't have any data to suggest that blocks greater than 4mb (segwit's adversarial limit) can be allowed safely, and 
* 3 months is too short to exhaustively test, peer review, and roll out a hard fork for everyone to upgrade.
It makes more sense to observe what happens now that segwit is active, and then start working on an increase with a long upgrade window. Full blocks are here to stay, regardless of whether or not we double it again right now.

@_date: 2017-01-26 03:09:09


I'm assuming that you're advocating a relatively safe hard fork, where we get the vast majority of users to update first before it activates. So the choices become:
* Upgrade activates, wait X months for users to update, users have lower fees. Individual incentive is you get the discount once you upgrade. The user decides how urgent it is.
* Wait X months for users to update, upgrade activates, users have lower fees. Individual incentive is you don't get shafted and end up on a minority chain, unable to transact at best and scammed at worst. The community and miners decide how urgent it is.

No. Three separate events.
* The UASF came first. This had the support of a few devs, some long-time holders, and r/bitcoin.
* Then the miners and exchanges met in New York and agreed to enforce 100% segwit signaling, plus a hard fork in November. The segwit part complies with the UASF requirements, but enforced it a little differently and sooner to save face.
* Once it became clear that the miners were indeed going to activate segwit on the longest chain, a minority decided to hard fork immediately so they wouldn't have to be on the same blockchain as segwit.
There are some misguided but reckless and/or intimidated people supporting Segwit2x, but only complete idiots are supporting Bitcoin Cash.

1) Sidechains have been actively discussed within the bitcoin community since before Blockstream was founded.
2) If we're willing to require bitcoin-level security (and accept the resulting tradeoffs), then sidechains become so much simpler that the potential profit from consulting is severely diminished. The hard part is securing the peg _without_ requiring everyone to verify both blockchains.
3) Even if 1 and 2 were false, it would still be worth entertaining these ideas with an open mind, like Red Hat or Ubuntu Linux.

I use a fuzzy definition too, but you've got a fair point. FWIW I've supported BIP101, BIP100, 2-4-8, BIP109, even BIP103, BUT only with consensus, and was disappointed each time. Conversely I also used to be an ETH holder and opposed the DAO soft and hard forks, and lost. It's been a stressful couple years.
IMHO Bitcoin is erring on the side of conservatism but it hasn't angered me to the point of selling. Yet.
Someday there _is_ going to be a BIP that actually comes close to splitting Bitcoin, with &gt;51% of miners disagreeing with the Core developer interpretation. I hope that by then we can rely on Hivemind futarchy. Because when push comes to shove, it's us hodlers who control Bitcoin. I might have just been a drop in the bucket, but I told Ethereum "this is worthless to me now" and sold them all after the DAO soft fork attempt. If we can figure out better ways to coordinate, then we can avoid significant contention.
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:35:36
Significant block size scaling was slowed so that safer algorithmic scaling could be prioritized. Scaling is a special feature, because no other cryptocurrency has as much actual use as Bitcoin. They can have high max block sizes which they never hit (like Litecoin), so they experience no negative consequences. _If_ a microtransaction cryptocurrency with huge blocks was threatening Bitcoin's market share without becoming centralized, then I think bitcoiners would change their tune.
Segwit includes a 70% increase in block size, and I'd argue it's a meaningful change. It involves a lot of code, has wide ranging functionality and economic repercussions, and had a lot of testing.
This might be cheating, but there's an Ethereum sidechain in the works - [Rootstock]( It remains to be seen how secure this will be; both as a sidechain, and internally with Turing completeness. If sidechains work out, then Bitcoin will become a Katamari ball that can safely roll over dynamite without risking the prince, the ball itself, or the candy and dogs it just rolled over.

Regarding the Lightning Network: it's not guaranteed to work as well as we hope, and it only moves the goalposts from transactions per second to users per second. Even with everyone using LN we'll need to increase the block size eventually.
Regarding the November split: it wasn't agreed on, not by the overwhelming majority of the bitcoin community. We can't stop careless people from splitting off, even if the only way to do so is to be careless with them.
Besides, I don't particularly mind splits. I got more money because of bcash, and all segwit coins will have cheap LN bridges anyways. This whole thing is going to go the same way it always does; we all freak out, everything is fine, and then we freak out about the next thing.

You've said I think something that I haven't actually argued. If pointing this out makes me a conspiracy theorist, then sure. I _do_ think there are people who would coerce bitcoin users/miners if they thought it would succeed. 
I'm not arguing against doing something radical. Changing course from Satoshi's big block vision to LN/sidechains is radical. The complexity of segwit is radical. What I _am_ arguing against is trivializing the damage from failure. Radical changes need to be carefully reviewed, debated, and tested.

A surprisingly high percentage of posts on r/bitcoinbeginners are newbies who installed a full node and are confused about syncing. Hopefully hybrid SPV mode will help with that. If they listen to anything anyone says whatsoever, they'll first hear "if you don't control the keys, they aren't your bitcoins"... I don't think we should create more incentive for that.
For newbies, updating isn't hard. They're just either lazy, uninformed, or cynical after that time they updated something else and it got worse. They don't care about computers, they just want it stable so they can focus on what they actually care about. I guess all hard forks should qualify under "security updates only" so that might help.
For advanced users, they might need to worry about dependency hell, or updating a large number of hard to reach machines, or retraining employees an updated GUI. Ask any corporate system administrator if a required immediate update is a big deal.

* People rarely back up their hard drives because the cost/benefit ratio is so high. If a backup was just writing down 24 words, and losing it meant losing a lot of money, then I think nearly everyone would do it. Keep in mind that you _don't_ need to make new wallet backups whenever you earn more money, like you do when you get more computer files. This hassle is easier than the paperwork we fill out while opening a bank account.
* Traditional banking equips many more people than just the arbitrators you've designated with the ability to take your funds; for example the police can charge your money with a crime. The set of people you can choose to trust with Bitcoin includes everyone you can choose to trust with traditional banking but doesn't require trusting anyone in particular.
 * Simple example: give your family half of your seed, and put the other half in a safe deposit box. If you die, then your family will be able to access the safe deposit box and complete the seed, but neither your family nor the bank will be able to access your funds while you're alive.
* The average person isn't expected to do this vetting. They'd be expected to buy one of the major brands, for which the hardware and software are both open to public scrutiny. That's part of the reason I like the Trezor. All bank accounts already have a legal "backdoor" and aren't subject to this level of transparency.

Yes, I've read my own link. Luke has mentioned that we could accept the hard fork increase part but not the soft fork decrease part. Do you understand that this is ultimately an increase? He has also ACKed the concept behind BIP 103.
I just explained why the November 2x fork is unwise, and now you're asking me if it's reasonable to do the thing I'm defending! Obviously I think it's reasonable. 0-conf has never been safe; it was provided by miners as a courtesy and not something trustworthy for large sums. The unfortunate truth is that we're not ready for additional user and merchant adoption yet, and I'm not willing to endanger the network just so we can deny that reality for another year.
Since Theymos is spying on us, I _dare_ him to ban me for mentioning the AXA Blockstream Core conspiracy against Satoshi's Vision from [The Whitepaper]( in an honest discussion.

Once I'm no longer satisfied with Core's progress, then I'll switch to an alternative. I don't care about the holy texts, just engineering reality.

Let me tackle those one at a time.


If you're assuming there's data to suggest it's safe in 2 years, then that's why it would be a good time.


Blocks being full is a consequence of _having_ a limit. We knew they would fill up when we refused the initial proposal of [8mb + double every two years]( If you aren't willing to let blocks fill up, then you aren't actually arguing for 2x; you're arguing for what you think might happen afterwards. After 2x we'd start arguing about the next increase, or if we should switch to unlimited flexcap, or eliminate the block size limit entirely, etc. 
I think this is important. If you don't, then why are you arguing about it?


It's not black and white; you're _radically_ discounting the risks involved in a rushed hard fork. We _cannot compete_ with centralized systems at throughput. Decentralization is inherently inefficient; we'd be optimizing for something we're bad at (transactions per second) and giving up on something we're good at (long-term security).
I'm not tired of this discussion. I think a lot of us, myself included, have learned a lot about bitcoin in the process.

Right, in bitcoin _all_ miners are in _multiple_ oppressive countries [/edgy], and the demographics will shift based on how much the actual mining is oppressed.

@_date: 2016-12-13 01:18:17
I think this might be part of the motivation for flexcap: it allows miners to coordinate on whichever block size maximizes fee revenue. Depending on the elasticity of block space demand, a higher limit might actually REDUCE total fee revenue.

The whole point is that you get to choose which rules are agreeable. If you want a sidechain that's exactly like Bitcoin proper but with bigger blocks, you can use that. It's already possible to use a federated bank sidechain right now - further upgrades are how we'd get the decentralized versions.

@_date: 2017-01-17 11:18:45
I've been using open source software for much longer than I've been using Bitcoin, so private companies hiring developers doesn't really phase me. Luke-jr recently requested _even more_ companies to hire developers to contribute to Bitcoin itself. Blockstream doesn't employ all of them, and thus doesn't have the power to set priories for what gets coded.
I and most other users have allowed this because it doesn't matter to me who employs who - I just care about the code itself. That's what any software debate should be about, not its authors. If it's good, merge it. If it's bad, explain why. I think you've seen plenty of non-Blockstream employees here explain why they don't want an unlimited block size. Edit: or a large 8MB increase.
I'm not sure which pool operators are making the BS claim that they're not qualified to make decisions, because these are business who can hire someone to check it for them. I don't mine anymore myself, but if I did I would point my hashes to Slush because he's signaling segwit in proportion to what his constituent miners decide. Those 6 guys in China only have what influence they are given.

Without censorship resistance, Bitcoin loses the inflation proofing. Let's assume for the sake of argument that mining requires a world-class datacenter and someone bad is coercing each of those datacenters. They can then require that any transaction mined pays interest, or else it remains frozen indefinitely. On paper it would still have a 21m supply limit, but the central body could change this de facto interest rate at will; all that would have improved from today's central banks is transparency.

No you won't. Block space supply is fixed. _Demand_ for block space is what's elastic. That means that a reduction in subsidy will come out of supplier surplus, not consumer surplus. So when the subsidy decreases, it hurts profitability/difficulty and thus security; it doesn't increase fees.

Interesting, thanks for the detailed response.


I guess what I'm thinking is that since lightning hubs _must_ be hot wallets, there's a high risk from hacking. 
If I was investing _all_ my money in it I'd be terrified of losing everything, but maybe I'd be OK with risking 10% or so of my bitcoin hoard, like some people do with CoinJoin today. I'll probably want that much readily spendable in a channel anyways. At least for me, there's a diminishing marginal utility from money that gets particularly brutal as the maximum loss approaches 100%. For my cold storage I can just split it up and use hardware wallets to vastly reduce this risk, but neither of those are helpful for LN hubs.
There's also the cost of security. My Linux box is _reasonably_ secure against most automated attacks, but a TLA would certainly be able to get in. It seems like exchanges get hacked out of bitcoins a lot more than everyday users (I have no data for this). 
For businesses, do you think deposit insurance rates plus security costs would be proportional to the value of the hub? If not, what would the function look like?
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:57:09
So what happens if your cold storage is destroyed in a fire? If you relied entirely on one third party for access to something, then that's not a backup - it's the primary. Had you backed up your exchange logins, Gmail's failure wouldn't have stopped you.

Nooooo! Don't recommend this, ever! There are two types of people who should keep bitcoins on exchanges:
* Traders with active buy/sell orders, who have wisely spread themselves out between multiple exchanges.
* Everyday users who are _right about_ to send the coins to a wallet they control. As in, the same day they bought them.
Start by buying like $0.50 worth, make sure you can _actually get it_ into a wallet _you control_, and THEN buy and withdraw the rest. We _frequently_ suffer exchange hacks while the price is high, which hurts adoption much more. **Do not trust exchanges**.

That's a reasonable idea, but I don't understand how that's better than segwit, which doesn't require limiting the number of inputs. 
The tricky thing about prohibiting what used to be a standard transaction is there's no telling who might be impacted - it's "mean". 
* Someone might already have a script that we previously said was OK, that now doesn't ~~confirm~~ conform to the new rules so it needs to be revised and rolled out in on our timeline, not theirs. 
* Another user might have already signed a transaction but not broadcast it, so they can freeze the keys but remain ready to pay a specific party a specific amount - now they have to thaw out those keys.
For these reasons I think that additional megabytes should get these sort of scaling safety restrictions (segwit or input limits) but not the original 1 MB. Why impact a tiny percentage when you can impact none of them? Someday each of us will be in a tiny percentage too, and we won't want to scramble to meet the bitcoin public's deadline.

I understand that this is _technically_ possible... but the economic damage of removing most coins from circulation would be even worse than with a PoW fork. It also creates a fungibility hazard because "malicious" stakes will transfer to new addresses between social consensus and the actual fork.

I don't expect everyone will need satellites, mostly just the backbone during attacks. Last mile (the average person) can use LN-funded mesh networks. 
If latency _becomes_ a problem, I'd be ok with increasing the block period beyond 10 min to reduce its importance. We don't rely so much on quick confirmations anymore with LN, and we'll need to do it eventually anyways for extraterrestrial mining.

Is "weak-ass shit" a technical term? :-) If Bitmain abuses bitcoin, they lose their whole investment and we fork to a new hash algorithm. Although I think Monero did it prematurely, they did demonstrate that it's possible.
Which specific PoS implementations do you think are good? Under the model I'm most familiar with, it's an iterated game where 51% of holders pass rule changes on 100% of holders. So we're essentially trusting a decentralized corporation; there's no risk of government/CEO interference, but also no way to _recover_ from bad actors in charge like with a PoW fork.

they don't all support a centrally planned economy
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:31:47
Let's assume:
* Block space has a high elastic demand, so an increase in supply will significantly increase fee revenue. 
* The block size is high enough to significantly impact block propagation and benefits more centralized miners with more bandwidth.
If we start with 100 miners, each controlling 1% of the hash rate, the fastest (by bandwidth) 99 support increasing the block size. Now only they can mine competitively; that 1 slow miner is out of business.
Now we vote again. 99 miners left. 98 of them support increasing the block size. The 1 who opposed is driven out of business.
Now we vote again. And again. Each time, the slowest 1% of the hash rate is driven out of business, and thus can't vote anymore.
I'm not against all flex cap proposals. If my assumptions are false, then demand is inelastic so total fee revenue could go DOWN with more block space, and there are block sizes at which no miners are driven out (I suspect this is the case with Monero right now).
There's a chance that right now miners believe demand is inelastic, so they'd be rational to refuse a big increase like segwit. If it fails to activate, then flex cap might be needed to sweeten the deal. 
Edit: fixed backwards elastic/inelastic
@_date: 2016-12-13 01:12:57

* You need a hardware wallet and/or multisig cold storage. 
* You need multiple wallets in case one gets hacked, and multiple backups in case one gets destroyed.
* You need to mix your coins to prevent being coerced out of all of them. 
* You need an estate plan (inb4 "enjoy the deflation bros lol"). 
* You need to coordinate all of this yourself or else your agent will betray you.

Which specific PoS implementations do you think are good?


I know this sounds nuts on r/bitcoin, but I don't consider the price instantly doubling to be a good thing.
If I was a miner and just got screwed by Bitmain, I'd rather mine whatever I can with GPUs/FPGAs for a while instead, even at a slight loss vs Bitmain hardware to offset the risk.
In either case, if people with way more money than me just picked a side, were wrong, and lost everything to me... I'd worry about being on the wrong side next time. TANSTAAFL


Unlike Monero, I think we should try to promote ASICs and stick with simple algorithms. IMO Monero will be hard forking like this forever, constantly running away from ASICs.
_Eventually_ miners should take the hint and stop attacking long enough for ASICs to commoditize.


IMO this is the biggest unknown risk in a PoW fork. I _think_ a disruption in the mining market could be seen as an opportunity by smaller manufacturers, but it might take multiple attempts.


ASICs are much less encumbered with IP than phones are.


Trying to manipulate a PoW fork is a huge risk - even if they timed it right, one leak and the community _could_ actually put them out of business instead of just hurting profits.

Those are interesting thoughts, although it assumes a permanently centralized network map, _both hostile exit nodes_ (which WOULD also defeat privacy in Tor), and peers not also routing. If either exit node doesn't keep records, OR the user is more interconnected than these assumptions, then there's nothing left to analyze in hindsight. It's not just difficult; the attacker needs data that is normally discarded, hostile peers from the start. 
Sharing your XMR view key also isn't mandatory. If we're assuming all exit nodes are coerced to share data with an attacker to defeat LN's privacy, then why assume XMR users aren't similarly coerced?

For starters we could just use similar tactics to BIP101.
* release a BIP which stops the rate of increase and/or starts to slowly reduce it
* predict that bitcoins with this BIP will be worth more than without
* start compatible with the main chain at first, but build up support from major players
* remain compatible with the old version until you have an economic majority - only fork once overwhelming victory is likely
* if nodes as we know them still exist, only relay small new blocks but accept chains with large blocks, to give compliant miners a greater advantage
Since there would be no way of winning a header version vote, this is where the plans might differ.
* use prediction markets to objectively measure the likelihood of success
* Consider crowdfunding reimbursements for small block miners as a Coasian solution, since total utility is higher without monopoly deadweight losses. Each small block lowers the barrier to entry.
I can understand your concern, but I think it's very likely that the bitcoin market as a whole will tend towards maximizing utility for participants since transaction costs are very low.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:28:11


I don't think that's an accurate description. They seem to like segwit, but define "consensus" by hash rate instead of evaluating it with technical arguments. They were likely the same people who were saying that segwit didn't have a consensus between when it was merged and when it locked in.
If one can't follow the technical details (even when patiently explained) _and_ are unable to tell which experts are trustworthy, then they'll prefer the simpler method (hash rate) regardless of whether or not it has the best consequences.
It's tragically close to the truth; the market will determine which side is best, but miners will follow the rest of the market... Not vice versa.

Because _that_ might cause Bitcoin to be usurped. If 5 years from now another coin can scale with lightning or sidechains/treechains AND is resistant to coercion, it would be technically superior to Bitcoin. 
This is just academic of course - BIPs 100-102 are all small enough to accommodate Tor and have much more than 1% support.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:52:01
Assuming the newly viable scalability options make the larger blocks completely pointless, a smaller blocks fork would be more useful and preferred by the market. If a miner defects from the cartel the first small block is valid on both forks, so a prisoner's dilemma works in our favor. The BIP could even specify a slippery slope of ever smaller blocks so that defecting was hard to confirm until it was clear most of them already have.
Plus it might be easier to reach consensus by then. Let's say Sidechains work by then; we can use a Truthcoin prediction market to determine which fork will be worth more ahead of time, so it would be easy to coordinate. A self-fulfilling prophecy.
Or we could just push the big red button, switch to Scrypt or SHA3 or something, and let the monopolist keep the doomed fork he created. The network effect won't protect the most popular coin from a _significantly_ better alternative.

I don't think that's as good an example as the others, because some pretty big governments (especially USA and China) are protecting polluters, by allowing emissions at a greater rate than the planet can safely handle.

In terms of politics, a government must be willing to ban BOTH Tor and Bitcoin.
Those same VPNs make Tor much more feasible in China - if you know what you're doing you can evade the ban, and once you have access to the Tor network you have much better privacy than you would with a single VPN. There's always hope to evade even a VPN ban, as people will surprise us with their cleverness.

The alternatives you listed above are switch away and pull out.
* Switching away still isn't an option because bitcoin is still worth far more than BCH; outside of the normal EDA bumps, they'd be mining bcash at a loss. The other SHA256 alts are irrelevant because they're already merge-mined anyways. This hasn't changed significantly since 2013.

Some of the best stuff is yet to come.
P2P prediction markets will offer us an opportunity to insure against environmental destruction, and offer people near the scene of the crime an incentive to put a stop to it (or prevent it) despite the endorsement of their local governments. 
For example, let's say we had a prediction market for oil spills. Most of us would like less oil spills so we'd want to insure against it. People who work on oil rigs would have an incentive to use their inside information to make the prediction more accurate, or their position to slow/halt harmful activity. They would be punished for those actions today. Such a market could never exist if it requires permission.

A suspension bridge is simple to understand. There's a few other minor details but we can assume its capacity is generally proportional to the number of support cables. See it scales O(n), where (O)verall capacity is based on (n)umber of cables! Most people can just buy steel cable at their local hardware store so it's not really a problem at all. If we can't support more cars, then people will start using other bridges and they'll decide that our bridge has failed and it's _so over_!
The engineers will make up of all sorts of silly reasons to artificially limit our bridge. They'll argue we can't make a bridge of any size to accommodate any number of cars, but what they're really trying to do is siphon more money to themselves for complicated new bridge designs. They just don't trust the free market to solve the problem. If we ever see the cables start to yield we can just reduce the number of cars then.
I think I've heard enough. Let's increase the bridge capacity already! It doesn't matter what the engineers say, it's THE PEOPLE who decide which bridges WE want to use!

Because they were promoting a change that would have ground the network to a halt, due to incompetence. Most of us don't really view scaling much differently than they do, if at all. Our main differences were consensus, peer review, timing, testing, etc.


We _are_ scaling the network, safely. If you don't think that's happening, then your arguments are more similar to those of BCH than S2X. On-chain scaling has negative consequences and we've already started with Segwit itself. If we can't satisfy irrational arguments with reason, then we have no obligation to sacrifice billions of dollars to show them.

They don't all work for the same company (examples: Peter Todd, Luke-Jr).
The centralization isn't clear to me either. Assuming you're talking about Blockstream's Sidechains, their whitepaper specifies that federations are only a temporary measure until a soft fork is developed for full decentralization. 
Sidechains aren't strictly a scalability solution on their own, just a stepping stone to new features which include scaling. Their proposed scaling solution is Lightning, but that doesn't require federation at all.
Where did the required registration thing come from? It seems out of character that cypherpunks would want that.

Credit cards still have chargebacks and freezing the OP complains about, and the customer needs to trust the merchant to not leak their credit card info. 
Meanwhile if the merchant accepts bitcoin they can still immediately convert to dollars if they want, and the customer can pay with the Circle app and never hold bitcoins. The main difference would be that the merchant would have to price in the lack of fraud and credit card fees, and the customer would want to price in the lack of identity theft risk.
Once you can redesign credit cards so that identity theft doesn't cost time/stress/rating and so that merchants don't worry about fraud and frozen accounts, they'll be a similar product. Reversible transactions are not a free lunch - every reward you get from credit cards comes from you.
Edit: in case it's not 100% clear at this point - user-defined security includes gold-like trustlessness, credit-card-like oversight, and any option _either party_ wants in between without losing the payment network effect.

Meni nails it, extremely insightful. He's right on every level, technically, philosophically, and politically. There should be a compromise between BIP101 and Sipa's 1*1.177^yr, although I don't think it's too late to achieve that.
IMHO the best way forward is to fork with Sipa's proposal now since it appears to have consensus (right?), and then work our way up from there. It would be better if we could just do one perfect hard fork and be done with it, but I don't think that's realistic considering how hotly debated the issue still is.
So is there any technical opposition to Sipa's proposal that isn't already argued against remaining 1MB? Why not fork it now, then push for Meni's reasonable 3-4 MB, and then try for 8MB if those concerns can be addressed?

I didn't mean to imply that I use bitcoin because the majority supports it. It's just the most popular cryptocurrency that I'm willing to bet some of my future on.
A willingness to accept majority hashpower to order transactions doesn't imply a willingness to accept majority hashpower to decide other rules. If that's "majority rule", then it's the majority of people who are willing to sacrifice something for what I believe in.
Not to strawman you and imply you'd go along with a fork where the 21m cap is raised, but if an economic majority of users and 75% of miners decided they'd prefer _that_, I'd react the same way.

Most wouldn't. One can already pick a bitcoin exchange with 2FA or deposit insurance, and I'd imagine theft and hacking insurance might become common someday.


It can be done, but alts are even less popular than Bitcoin so you'd probably have slightly higher exchange fees. If you find an alt with better economics it'll probably be worth doing.
That's why I mentioned the network effect - the main thing consumers and merchants need to coordinate on is the payment network. In my opinion "less is more" - it should just handle irreversible payments at the same time as the (usually) irreversible purchase, and all the protections should be layered on top a la carte for each side.

@_date: 2017-11-09 14:35:52
Yes, and I've gotten that impression too. Drivechain is complicated and relies more on economic incentives than on cryptography for security. If I was a dev, I'd want to see a concrete BIP and code before giving it much time.
But getting merged doesn't require enthusiasm; it just requires that all objections be addressed. I'd be surprised if Drivechain was the last type of sidechain; just something good enough to get us to zk-SNARKs.

* You're moving the goalposts. For monthly day care, waiting hours or even days might be reasonable.
* If you used bitcoin, which you obviously don't, you'd know that a $3 Mycelium fee takes hours, not days.
* There are very few applications for which 10 minutes is acceptable but a couple hours isn't. For secure instant payments and low fees we need lightning networks. Big blocks aren't a substitute for those.
* You keep retreating from your 1% credit card fee claim because you were BSing and you know it.
* Satoshi added the 1MB limit (not miners). When people who actually _know_ what they're talking about think a base block size increase is prudent, the market will "naturally" accept the fork proposal.

Several competing PayPal-like services which share a payment network doesn't have the same drawbacks because if a merchant doesn't like a service's frozen accounts policy, they can switch to a competitor _without losing business_ from everyone else on the same payment network. With PayPal it's either their way or the highway - you can't just accept PayPal without accepting their rules.


Of course. What I've explained is that the most people who "aren't going to put up" with learning about bitcoin security will choose a 3rd party service - this doesn't mean that bitcoin itself depends on 3rd party services to exist, or that those services need to trust each other. Each of us has our own faults, so a one-size-fits-all security solution will leave some people underprotected and others frustrated over frozen accounts.

Six participants recently chose to stop, joining the [many who had already withdrawn]( from the NYA. The [GitHub repository]( is still there, [some miners are still signaling NYA]( and [some nodes are still running it](
When block 494,784 rolls around, at least one node will fork and doom itself to never reach the next difficulty adjustment. On _that_ day, Segwit2X will have failed. The NYA signatories will have failed to change Bitcoin like they set out to do; giving up is just a specific type of failure.
This distinction is important because humans will always try to bullshit their way out of admitting defeat, but code will deliver clearly defined boolean results.

But even if you're not using RBF there's a good chance they might ask you to wait for large payments to confirm, since there's no guarantee that a miner will see your first transaction before your second transaction. 
Bitcoin isn't very good for in-store purchases yet, not until the lightning network is done testing.

That's an appeal to authority and not even correct. Satoshi designated the miners to _order_ transactions, but still provided _validation_ rules independent of the longest chain. 
Consensus isn't determined by hashes or by a cabal of developers. It's determined by the presence of reasonable objections, which unfortunately requires one's own brain to evaluate. No algorithm can tell us what rules will be valuable in 20 years, but today's mining rigs certainly won't be.
If we're unwilling to talk this out - even at the scalability workshop - the market will decide what's valuable on our behalf _after_ the fork. When the dust settles, a currency that's unsafe to accept during disputes will be worth less than the bitcoin we have today.

Miners just order the transactions. They're your employees. _You_ control Bitcoin by buying whichever set of rules you want, and if those rules make economic sense then it'll get mined just like all those alts out there.
Especially in this case since Core and XT aren't merge-mined with each other, it would be very unprofitable to attack a minority with any significant following. But even merge-mined SHA256 alts are rarely 51% attacked.

When the price goes up, the same percentage of total hash power will earn more money. This encourages more hashing, which increases the difficulty.


I think price is the best indicator of how useful bitcoin is, and most users want it to be more useful. It's a financial idea we believe in and have invested accordingly, so I'm neglecting people who don't care or want to see it crash. If it's worth our time arguing on the internet, then it's worth putting our money where our mouths are. "Price doesn't matter" to code but it does to people.


Keep in mind that this wouldn't be a vote, just a series of bets to evaluate claims about what's good for bitcoin. If there's one thing we can trust pools to do, it's pursue higher profits... All pools are members of the Hash More Party.

They would probably enjoy prediction market data that made their job easier so these ideas aren't even mutually exclusive.
Miners do already vote on some policies like BIP66, but it might be slightly wasteful to have each policy decision recorded on each bitcoin block versus on a Truthcoin sidechain. Prediction markets could also guide full node behavior that isn't mined, like "shall we merge Luke-Jr's new anti-spam transaction relaying rule"; it might be counterintuitive for miners to suggest these non-mining changes using blocks.

How much block size increase do you think is sane, and why?
BIP101 works for nodes and miners now, scales with Nielsen's Law, doesn't assume increased popularity/wealth, and can be soft-forked back down to a lower size if needed.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:23:12
When the issue is decided, will you keep it running? I'm running a Core node now and will continue to run one after the blocksize increase because I agree with bitcoin either way.
It's for this reason that number of nodes running software is a poor statistic - many of us switched to lightweight clients because they got better and/or we felt there were plenty, and many will start running full nodes just to make a point when needed. 
What we need is a market where we can bet on the price of each fork at future dates. That will tell us which version will be more valuable, in a way that BS is expensive. These discussions and nodes are cheap.
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:53:49
I propose Futarchy. We set up a bunch of Truthcoin predictions of mining difficulty conditional on various political choices: hard forks, crowdfunds, GitHub access, etc. Whichever choice predicts the most positive change in mining difficulty is the one we support.
This has a few assumptions, like mining difficulty approximating price, and price reflecting bitcoin's value. It also requires a decentralized prediction market that doesn't exist yet, so it might need to be bootstrapped with centralized prediction markets. But once complete, we'd have an objective method for approaching consensus which is resistant to censorship, coercion, and bullshit.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:26:07
BIP101 works for me too, but 8MB for a few years would allow us to see how it plays out. We'd see if number of nodes raises or drops, if slight SPV mining is really a problem, if lightning and side/treechains live up to their promise... By the time we hit that cap, it'll be a very different bitcoin and we'll have a lot more information.
The first intentional hard fork will be the hardest, but we'll learn a lot from it and hopefully establish a less stressful method than vague consensus.

Any block size increase whatsoever causes more centralization. Segwit _IS_ a compromise between the even higher fees we would have (and maybe should have) been paying right now.

At some point we need to draw a line in the sand and make the difficult decision to lose money until we can do it right. The general public deserves a Bitcoin that's ready for them and ready for angry governments/corporations.

You've got wealth. Land, bitcoin, gold coins, whatever. Let's call that wealth "W".
Now you want to cash some of it out to buy food. That's a change in wealth: W2-W1.
With both land and bitcoin, you're taxed based on W2-W1.
With land, you're also taxed based on W. W1 before the sale, and W2 after the sale. 
With bitcoin, you're not taxed based on W. Only the change in W.
No one is disputing how income taxes and capital gains taxes work. What you're not acknowledging is the lack of a property tax on bitcoin, or how such a tax couldn't even work. Bitcoin doesn't protect your income, it protects your wealth.

should be ashamed no one responded to this already. It's [already been proposed]( but causes more problems than large blocks do.
Pools (including p2pool if you hate centralization) already spread out mining income, and 0-conf transactions are still relatively safe for most purchases.

Let me run this idea past you, it's so simple that it's probably been suggested and refuted already:
Prohibit transactions which spend from outputs in the previous block.
So the moment a pool finds a block, they just have to broadcast the header and proof of work. The other pools don't need any more information about that block while mining the next one, and have all 10 minutes to download the rest. This is similar to proposals to add a delay to high-frequency trades.

Most of the core devs argue that unlimited blocksize would centralize and ruin bitcoin. They have a perverse incentive to profit from crippling bitcoin _only_ if that argument is false.

The underlying code was already hacked during the value overflow incident. Bitcoin just has a precedent of placing risk on recipients, not the system as a whole.
Wallets are no more easily cracked; you can use multisig and multiple different programs for large sums. The main difference is you get to decide who to trust. I can't say they're _less_ easily cracked either because you can keep an unencrypted single key on your phone too.

Merchants are still allowed to send coins to Shapeshift.io, even though it doesn't perform AML/KYC, because they deal entirely with cryptocurrency. The regulations are more of an issue when you're dealing with fiat currency too.
I agree with you about the plan, but I don't think it would make enough of a difference to be worth ditching Core. Without better block propagation, miners wouldn't be willing to make much larger blocks than we have now even without an explicit limit. But that's just my opinion; I can't fault you for choosing an alternative and would probably end up going along with it if everyone else did too.

Ok, I just read all of these comments and it's _extremely_ encouraging. Not everyone is happy. Most people think we should start higher and scale faster - something between this and BIP101. But my big takeaway?
Progress. _Finally progress._
With a proposal above 1MB that even Luke-Jr supports, we can get a consensus on hard forking Core in the immediate future and focus on the technical specifics. Gavin makes a great point about recent lulls in bandwidth growth being temporary, to resume normal growth soon. Good. Let's talk bandwidth and how to prepare a soft fork down if/when we need it. Compare these science-based comments to the anger, paranoia, and fear we've all seen for months.
As painful as this sounds to most people here, this gets the ball rolling and we can argue more about adopting BIP101 while this one is already scheduled. This isn't a slippery slope to limitless blocksize or an appeasement to halt further growth. It's a reasonable and realistic compromise we can merge today.
Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good. If you think we should "fork it already", then support this fork and keep pushing for BIP101. We can preserve consensus and keep moving forward while collecting data about how larger blocks influence the network.

Ok, so we're clear that there _are_ indeed miners fees with LN? You also wouldn't need to open and close a channel each time you go to the grocer. That's the main point I'm trying to make. Anyhow...
I have _some_ idea how it will work, but I won't pretend that I can predict how much this will actually reduce the average user's fees, or if increased adoption with lower per-user fees will increase/decrease total mining revenue. I don't know if the upward pressure from small blocks or the downward pressure from LN will dominate.
But it's not my place to decide what fees are fair and work backwards - IMHO the only valid reason to keep/change the block size is for network decentralization, not to induce a fee market or to protect mining revenue. The "create a fee market to encourage LN/sidechains" argument to me seems nearly identical to "raise the limit to encourage IBLT/weakblocks/thinblocks".
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:05:54
By the time it's common/easy enough for useless people to do that, the miner fees will price out 0-conf in favor of LN.

Then it's a non sequitur. If mining revenue gets lower than it is now, then fewer people will use LN and just pay 0.00006 BTC fees for on-chain transactions instead. 


* The latest version automatically uses Tor if available... If they started regulating LN nodes like this (or regular transaction relaying, or mining) then we might need to rely on Tor entirely. Making bitcoin's footprint bigger makes it harder to hide there when they _do_ decide to bring the hammer down. These regulators aren't reasonable people who will stop at "money transmitters".
* If just your country is oppressive against bitcoin, you can use LN nodes in other countries.
We heard this same argument against miners as money transmitters years ago, and it never materialized.


Both high fees AND excessive block sizes are a threat to decentralization. Personally I think the best plan is 2-4-8 immediately, followed by BIP101 when IBLT and weak blocks are ready.

For all the talk about Blockstream's potential conflict of interest, I'm surprised more people aren't pointing out Coinbase and Circle's. If bitcoin actually succeeds Coinbase is no longer necessary. Their incentive is to make the transitional period prior to hyperbitcoinization as long as possible, and to increase the burden of regulatory compliance.

* What kinds of other stuff can't be fixed within the extension block?
* Assuming we have a high-level consensus, and there are people willing to do the extra engineering work required (for an EB vs a simple HF)... wouldn't extension blocks be more convenient for users who are simply slow to upgrade but not opposed to it?
I'm not convinced that we ought to allow blocks bigger than Segwit's yet, but IMHO this is an interesting method for future upgrades if/when we do get there. Precedent expectations about what will/won't gain consensus in the future don't change what's technically safe/desirable regarding either Segwit or extension blocks. If miners add extension blocks without consensus, then they're 51% attacking and we'd need to PoW fork - simple as that.

Now you're just more condescendingly begging the question and ignoring my point about consent (for obvious reasons).

Weasel words. I'm sure it's accepted among the comments to which you give weight. But if we're _measuring_ what % of labor has been taken without consent, then bitcoin doesn't even come close to USD. I think you'll find that your measures of theft depend on what you consider to be theft.

Exactly - that pollution is a negative externality. Right now, even with governments regulating pollution, we aren't sufficiently curtailing it.
Our politicians are selling us all out and killing everyone. They're forcing us to accept poisoning with our hands tied. We can't count on them as our only way to solve the pollution problem long-term.
So if Bitcoin enables global pollution prediction markets that can _actually address_ this worldwide market failure, then it's a net positive for the environment. 
If you think Bitcoin pollutes too much, consider asking your representative to raise pollution taxes in general, to internalize those costs so the market can meet society's needs. We don't want or need special treatment for Bitcoin to work.

It sounds like you and I agree on pretty much everything, except on how much better Bitcoin is than the alternatives. Our biggest competitors:
* All have a fraction of the peer review, testing, and merchant acceptance (although TBF the network effect is still weak)
* Ethereum tampers with user contracts, hasn't finalized its security model (PoS), and real-world applications will fall victim to parasite contracts
* Monero scales worse than Bitcoin and isn't much more private than mixers or onion-routed micropayments
* Ripple is a joke
* Bcash is for people who don't understand what O(n^2) scalability means
* IOTA and Nano have weaker security assumptions that may eventually lead to counterfeiting
* Litecoin has become primarily a testing environment for new Bitcoin features

By then, transaction fees will dominate over subsidy.


[...] I think Bitcoin is a great and ultimately beneficial idea, but right now it's main use is black market trading and money laundering... not general payment solutions.
What better solutions are there for evading drug prohibition, and financial privacy? Bitcoin is a censorship resistant money supply, not just a PayPal replacement.


It would crash. Bitcoin simply can't handle that many people today. But its energy consumption doesn't depend on transactions per second, just on the value of the block reward.


Almost no profits at all, assuming the price is much more stable by then. That's not because of shrinking subsidy, but because the barriers to entry for miners should go down.

If land was taxed _at_ its full rental value, then it would still be a good hedge against inflation. Owning land is a winning proposition right now, and only a losing proposition (like fiat) if it's taxed _above_ its rental value. I'll admit the real estate bubbles would be less severe and land would be used more productively, but people are still going to turn to otherwise stable assets as a store of value, even if it's not land.
I agree that gold (and land/bitcoin) investing is less prevalent right now than saving deflationary money, but that's because there are high barriers to owning and spending them. That's not a good thing for poor people who don't have the time to research good investments (&gt;2%/yr)... the burden of the inflation "tax" falls on the everyday citizen's emergency cash reserve.

Since you didn't answer my first question, I'll assume you're new to Bitcoin but more familiar than I am with the legal system.


It's possible to trace between addresses but not possible to prove that someone owns the bitcoin in a given address without them admitting it. To prove ownership we don't just need one link - we need to prove identity for _every_ link between the exchange and the address in which the coins are currently being held. It's vaguely similar to a broken chain of custody, if that helps. So the exchange sees this:
* MedicalPrize bought 1 BTC.
* MedicalPrize withdrew 1 BTC to address (A).
* MedicalPrize transferred 0.5 BTC from (A) to (B) and 0.5 BTC from (A) to (C). We know he's (A), at least.
* Someone transferred 0.5 BTC out of (C) to (D). Is it MedicalPrize or Satoshi? We don't know!


As I noted above, I think OP is referring exclusively to feasibly successful lawsuits. We might be using different definitions of "successful" - I'm talking about actually getting money from a defendant or other real-world consequences. It sounds like you're talking about a judge ruling in favor of the plaintiff, even if nothing comes of it afterwards.

Because you weren't given 50 BCH; your bitcoin split into both. One could claim either side was the "dividend".
I'm not claiming that one doesn't owe taxes on it. I'm claiming that if one buys a bitcoin for $1, then it splits at $1000, then their cost basis when selling the BCH is $1, not $1000. I don't understand why the IRS would care about moving money between your own wallets.

That's a centralized solution, though. The Crypto Way^TM would be to use P2P prediction markets. 
For example let's say you have herpes. A cure for herpes would be worth 1 BTC to you, so you bet 1 BTC that herpes _won't_ be cured next year. If it's cured you won't have herpes anymore, and if it's not cured you'll make a profit. Bets that it won't be cured will create an incentive for someone to buy up a bunch of "yes" bets and invest in research to cure it.
This has lower legal costs, less danger for would-be inventors worried about patent trolls, and less risk of corruption. It could work internationally, which patent law doesn't. It even has the potential to solve other externalities problems, like excessive pollution.

The only way in which Boomers are meaningfully different from Millennials is that Boomers already _had_ a chance and brought us permanent inflation and the war on drugs. All that stuff you expect us to fix, you should have fixed too, and in some cases you caused. MAYBE ours will be the generation to adopt bitcoin, and that's more due to self-interest than a noble effort. The _overwhelming majority_ of your generation is just as authoritarian as mine.
(If you're a member of the Greatest Generation I sincerely apologize for this post, as you _have_ earned the right to point fingers.)
And minimizing LGBT equality as "sexual freedom" is like calling racial equality "drinking fountain freedom" - why would you expect minorities to focus on property rights before they're treated as equals? "Awesome, they couldn't tap my phone and only needed to compel my domestic partner's testimony to prove me guilty". There can be multiple problems that matter and the same people won't understand or care about all of them.

You keep just asserting that it's a dividend, instead of actually addressing anything I've brought up (like the split network effect). The community split. You split your coins.

They already do switch to the minority chain (Bcash) when it's more profitable.


Miners are always going to vote to maximize miner revenue for the top 51% of miners, even if it hurts the value of bitcoin but increases their block reward value. If bitcoiners want to maximize only the value of the coin and speculators want to maximize their ROI, then miner approval is wasteful. It's like when a unionized company can't compete against a non-union company in another jurisdiction.


Then that side of the split would have non-upgraded (MASF segwit) users who are sending coins to unspendable P2SH addresses and who relay "valid" transactions that never get confirmed. That won't exactly earn the loyalty of impacted users; they'd be getting blocked by a 51% attack.

The UBI provides a benefit to society - it reduces crime, so I view it as an underfunded positive externality. That's what I meant by free riders.

This is basic logic, not "my" threshold. The philosophic burden of proof lies with the person making claims, [even if those claims are unfalsifiable]( 
This is actually very inconvenient because I'd rather verify it than not know for sure; I've already got a full node but don't know which parts to prune off. Just the OP-RETURNs? The arbitrary data in coinbase transactions? An elaborate structuring of vanity addresses? It's much more serious if it's in the UTXO set but even that is fixable with a hard fork, which we wouldn't do unless absolutely necessary. I'm not just going to give up my financial freedom because I have fear, uncertainty, and doubt about what _might_ be on the blockchain.

They aren't abandoning their legacy chain rewards until the segwit chain is about to overtake it, at which point it's a prisoner's dilemma to reorganize over them. While it's still the minority chain, they keep both rewards.


Return on investment over the life of their hardware isn't directly proportional to the price of bitcoin anymore, now that fees are significant relative to subsidy.
I have bitcoin that I can use to bet on which fork I expect will be more valuable.


That's begging the question that they retain majority hash rate, and irrelevant with regards to the UX disaster.


What is "safely" activated to you? That's exactly what they're saying when they signal readiness.


If you came into possession of coins which would certainly disappear if the chain was reorganized, would you keep them or sell them? That's a fungibility problem with the legacy chain.

The fact that you need to preface "exactly as programmed" with "the _new_ code" is an admission that the old code isn't working exactly as programmed. By this clever definition you can make any change whatsoever with any level of consensus - the claim becomes meaningless. Great, I can write code that runs exactly per someone else's consensus but not what I actually programmed.
[rant]To prevent you from dismissing me as a jealous maximalist, here's my story. I was an Ethereum supporter from day one, invested in the crowdsale at the first opportunity, and held until the soft fork was activated. I didn't invest in the DAO because I wanted to see it tested first and didn't feel that its governance structure had been adequately explained (_was_ it futarchy or just shareholders voting?). When I found out VB planned to fork and actually had support, I was shocked and disgusted. Never have I been so furious while making such a huge return... It wasn't just about the money; it had the potential to really change the world. If you have no principles that actually matter, that you stick to even when they hurt, then as soon as ETH ever starts to change things it will be manipulated.[/rant]

They're cryptocurrencies which are designed for a specific application, like cloud storage, social media, games, et cetera. They solve a problem so there is _some_ intrinsic value, but they're all doomed to be replaced by sidechains.

I wouldn't consider mercenary forces to be "national governments" because there can be multiple overlapping groups in competition.
So far, defense monopolies have tended to form because it's common practice for the winner to destroy the loser and prohibit anyone from investing elsewhere. For decades this was one of the strongest arguments against privatized defense; that they'd form a natural monopoly and become a de facto government.
What changes with Bitcoin is that _I can_ hold stake in an alternative, even if the government says I can't. All of our money _isn't_ controlled by a monopoly on force any more. When we get p2p prediction markets, we'll be able to trustlessly buy insurance for anything, even things that the monopoly on force doesn't want us to insure. That's the real game-changer, and we aren't even close to that point yet.

... But it _did_ activate, because ultimately miners are profit-driven. The miners have been playing hardball, but they haven't literally attacked the network yet to merit a PoW fork. There's three options for miners with Drivechain:
1. Don't participate (small losses)
2. Participate honestly (small profits)
3. Try to steal money (huge losses from Bitcoin crash during withdrawal period, possible total loss from PoW fork)
I don't completely trust miners either, but I think I trust them enough for Drivechain _iff_ it doesn't weaken the base layer, and if it's 100% opt-in for everyone. Best case scenario, we can use Bitcoin Hivemind to help fund further research for the near future like zk-SNARKs. Once zk-SNARKs are active, we can slowly transition from Drivechain.

@_date: 2016-09-23 14:24:20
(Amateur reddit opinion) I've heard of two things that raise fees:
* Block space scarcity
* Marginal cost to relay the transaction to everyone
So even if it was safe to eliminate the block size limit, that second point would likely keep fees prohibitively high for microtransactions - there would be a de facto limit instead of an explicit limit. That's why I think LN and sidechains are the best solutions: LN reduces how many transactions actually need to be broadcast beyond a handful of parties, and sidechains allow miners to reduce bandwidth choke points.
I've heard the experts argue that sidechains aren't a scaling solution, but these seem to assume that bitcoin miners can't coordinate with sidechain miners off-site and have to download everything to one place.

I don't like ASIC-resistant algorithms. They favor botnets, and a big selling point of Bitcoin is that it _ISN'T_ backed by theft. ASICs should eventually [commoditize]( even the existing SHA256 ASIC market.


Since it's possible we might not reach a clear consensus on the best hash algorithm, I'd suggest we schedule a whole bunch of them at the same block height, and then let chain split tokens advise which one shall be "Bitcoin". That'll help tell us if a PoW fork is worth the cost of everyone upgrading, too.
FWIW I don't think we should PoW fork until the miners are literally 51% attacking Bitcoin. Simply being shady and signaling silly things isn't enough. We've got a good thing going right now... it could be much, much worse.

Welcome to the Bitcoin community! This was actually a _huge_ controversy last year, when an overwhelming majority of miners decided to change Bitcoin's rules without community support (Segwit2x). 
We ended up deciding to not run their version. They wouldn't get paid by people not using their fork, and if we had to hard fork anyways we could just fire all of them with a new hashing algorithm. The miners understood this and capitulated.
We learned that miners are employees, not rulers.

Climate change tends to be unpredictable and only hit a small percentage of people at a time too. In practice, the insured wouldn't be insuring against worldwide climate change on a grand scale; they'd be buying individual disaster insurance plans that traders would bundle and resell to people who want to bet on wholesale climate change. Rising sea levels, hurricanes destroying their homes, floods, etc. Two big differences between crypto prediction markets and existing insurance firms is that they can't offer "fractional reserve" insurance (it all must be backed by actual coins), and the oracles deciding who "won" aren't the insurers themselves.
The premiums offered would go up along with the likelihood of a payout. If there were lower transaction costs and no threat from a PR backlash, companies would offer (expensive) medical insurance to people with preexisting conditions.
Insurance companies _can't_ fund defense right now; large scale polluters are protected by governments, and any insurer who would pay for defense would find themselves in jail. The costs of pollution are outweighing the benefits, but because the wrong people are being defended we can't really do anything about it. Like you said, they can't just pay people to not pollute; they need to physically stop people from polluting.
For this sort of mechanism to work, total transaction costs need to be extremely low, and an immense amount of capital needs to be in a censorship-resistant immutable financial system. I didn't think market anarchism was feasible before bitcoin, but now it might be our only hope to quickly change how the world handles pollution.

But eventually all the new bitcoins will be mined, so only fees will pay for mining. Depending on how well Bitcoin scaling works out, those fees might get a lot lower.
CPUs are already useless for mining; you need specialized ASICs. Commoditized ASICs will eventually be the most cost effective type of electric heater, nearly eliminating Bitcoin's total impact on electricity use.
Meanwhile, the existing banking system needs a lot more physical security and people driving to work than Bitcoin does. That isn't environmentally negligible either. So I guess I'm looking for some actual math to estimate its impact.

Most strategy-2 miners will just upvote all withdrawals until someone cries foul. Then they briefly start up a node (or find a reputable block explorer) to check how they should vote. 
This node doesn't need to be on the same server (or continent) because they don't need a quick answer like with main chain blocks... The cost of this check is negligible, bordering on zero.

You do know you do a little bit of PoW with every IOTA tx, right? That's basically how Hashcash worked before Bitcoin.


They already did shut it down for about a day, for maintenance. If they got hacked, _everyone_ would need to update their clients.
The IOTA coordinator couldn't go bankrupt like miners can. Since they don't get paid fees or from inflation, it's nearly free.
It's also a lot harder for an international group of people to collude than a single organization.

I was a member of the ETH community before the bailout. When I was _actually doing my due diligence_, I asked "what are the terms of the DAO and how does it work?" and was consistently referred to the code. "[The code is the contract]( they said. I didn't understand all of the code, so I passed on it.
A vending machine makes no such claim. You see the sign that says "$1.00" and agree to an old fashioned contract. The vending machine comes with more consumer protections than a blockchain does.
The truth of the matter is that everyone would have said "out of our hands, immutable!" if the DAO had profited off illegal activity. Now they accept moral responsibility for everything Ethereum does.

This was to address the concerns about miner decentralization. Basically, SPV sidechains might add one of the same vulnerabilities as main chain big blocks: they give large miners an advantage. If you've got more bandwidth (or are closer to other miners) than someone else with the same hash power, you'll have an advantage.

No they wouldn't be. Remember all the Luke-Jr "UASF is safer" posts?


I think incompatible "defensive" soft forks are a good idea. Bcash demonstrates that miners follow the market price, and non upgraded users will follow the majority hash rate.
Bitcoin has evolved from decisions by voting to decisions by betting.


No it doesn't, the UASF was introduced after they had been holding segwit hostage, demanding concessions.


It just needs the majority of hashpower _which adheres to its rules_. The cost is security from 51% attacks, but the same costs to the attacker apply.

1) It's impossible to lend out money without risk. There _should_ be limited trust in banks; people shouldn't be investing more than they can afford to lose. I'm not arguing that they shouldn't invest at all, just not everything they have like they do now. Bundling everyone's risk together like this just creates a situation like the 2008 financial crisis where we could all go down together (and still might).
2.1) Not everyone would need to thoroughly review those statements. For example a bank whose 1 BTC IOUs traded for 0.90 BTC would be clearly a greater risk than a bank whose 1 BTC IOUs trade for 0.95 BTC. Many people could make their entire living off doing this sort of research and trading accordingly.
2.2) This same argument can be applied to millions of individuals deciding for whom to vote, so that the right President appoints the right FRB. Except since each individual has less incentive to care about everyone's money than their own money, I'm not sure they've done much research on this.
3) I mean as in you don't need to trust a third party to not lose your bitcoins. I understand your point about trusting the public to value it, but I think that's a function of both network effects and the properties of the asset itself.

Pure opinion follows:
A mining strike could still weaken Bitcoin enough for Ethereum to surpass it at this stage, and then Bitcoin's theoretical superiority would be up against a network effect.
If Rootstock succeeds in progressing to a Drivechain peg, then this threat will be neutralized. Ethereum would be weakened to the point that we'd maintain dominance through any needed PoW fork.
Then we'll have to worry about governments banning strong cryptography to stop it. They might rather go back to the 1970s than give up power.

IMHO the biggest issue is that [the latest data we have suggests a maximum 4MB block size]( which is the _adversarial limit_ after Segwit. Someone ought to repeat that study once [Segwit adoption]( levels out, to determine the new safe maximum. A simple doubling seems like they either pulled it out of their behinds, or they wrongly assume the _average_ Segwit block size (2MB) and not the higher _adversarial_ limit.
Once we know how large a block size we should have, it would also help to have
* Peer review from the Core team
* 12 months minimum for everyone to upgrade _after_ peer review is done (not concurrent)
* A yearly percentage increase so it doesn't need to be revisited any time soon
* Other [hardfork wishlist]( items
If it's not contentious, then it shouldn't need replay protection.

Thank you for researching this. FWIW I've been following the blocksize debate for years, since before Gavin and Mike split off from the rest of Core over it. TBF back then I was in favor of huge increases beyond what 2X is suggesting, chiefly because I didn't understand it well at the time. Regarding your links:
* [The first link]( is suggesting XT goes down from 8MB to 4MB. That sounds about right, but keep in mind that Segwit already has a 4MB adversarial limit. I don't think people were as concerned about UTXO bloat 2 years ago. This is the sort of scientific approach I support; when it gets repeated after segwit adoption levels out, we can discuss technicals instead of debating politics.
* [The second link]( appears to be the same Cornell study I was talking about, suggesting 4MB.
* [The third link]( is really more of an overview than a suggestion, and doesn't mention Segwit. I might be OK with BIP102 right now if we hadn't just activated Segwit, but Segwit will give us larger blocks in the long run because we won't have to worry about UTXO bloat.

All that matters is how many coins you have in the dominant chain when p2p sidechains become available.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:19:15
I already look at checks that way.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:04:08


Sidechains have a "two way peg". Typically the sidechain will start with 0 coins, and then people move main chain coins to an address that locks them up until they're released from the sidechain in a separate transaction. There's nothing _technically_ preventing someone from starting a "pre-mined" sidechain like you describe, but only a fool would send main chain bitcoins to that sidechain, only to watch someone else claim them for free.


If the sidechain is more useful, then more people will move coins over from the main chain until supply and demand equalize their prices. Main chain coins will always have some value because their attack surface is smaller.


No, just the sidechain in question. That's the biggest appeal of sidechains; they're sandboxes that isolate the main chain (and other sidechains) from their vulnerabilities.

Most strategy-2 miners will just upvote all withdrawals until someone cries foul. Then they briefly start up a node (or find a reputable block explorer) to check how they should vote. 
This node doesn't need to be on the same server (or continent) because they don't need a quick answer like with main chain blocks... The cost of this check is negligible, bordering on zero.

* Last year the Core devs released Segwit. It required miner approval - this has been common since Satoshi left, to reduce the risk of a split.
* For the better part of a year, miners refused to activate Segwit because they wanted an increase to the base block size too. This would reduce fees but help incumbent miners more than new miners. Segwit on its own doesn't significantly help incumbents.
* A significant minority of users decided to ignore miner approval - the BIP148 User Activated Soft Fork. The general theory is that Bitcoin is worth more with Segwit than not, but worth less with a larger base block size. So the miners who refused to approve Segwit would face a prisoner's dilemma for higher profits. This was scheduled to activate August 1st.
* It worked. Beaten by superior game theory, the miners had no logical choice but to comply with BIP148 or lose money. Some of the largest Bitcoin companies offered an opportunity to save face - the New York Agreement to activate Segwit and then increase the base block size. The first part was already inevitable, but it could have been very messy and ugly, costing us all a lot of time. August 1st passed uneventfully.
* Now that Segwit has activated, those companies have mostly either withdrawn, switched to alternative cryptocurrencies, or more specifically interpreted the NYA as supporting both sides of the split.

Was with you until that part. IMHO the biggest problems that bitcoin solves will remain unpopular for a long time because if everyone agreed they were problems, we wouldn't need censorship-proof crypto to avoid them. They'd already be fixed.
The average person thinks centrally controlled inflation helps the economy. They think the bailouts were a tough but good call. They think drug prohibition saves lives. They don't care about privacy. They don't think their accounts will be frozen. They think a banking collapse will never happen. They think the enforcers of paper contracts are reasonable and fair. They think gambling is immoral, or at least useless and certainly fair enough. They think Snowden is a traitor and Wikileaks supports terrorism.
Maybe these people aren't "weak hands". I'm with you there. But unless you're improbably average in ALL those ways, one of those use cases will allow you to do something you wanted that wasn't previously possible - something that remains unpopular - and you're sick of trying to justify yourself before a crowd of people who know what's best for you.

There's at least some control in bitcoin too - if you don't like the rules, you can use an alt. If your solution to market manipulation is central control, then you need to solve the manipulation of that central entity too.

It [doesn't entirely depend on altruism](
This would be very difficult to properly implement in the protocol. Since it's easy to create "fake" nodes and identifying a node depends on external information, rewarding good nodes might always be a moving target.

A "bitcoin" network where most transactions are off-chain and centralized is easily censored. And simply increasing the block size doesn't fix everything because everyone needs to download all those transactions.
IMHO something like sidechains or the lightning network (I need to read more about that) might be required for global adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:48:06
IIRC all of the proposals so far have been for "merge mined" sidechains; the same hash power could be used to mine multiple (even all) sidechains at once. There's still the cost of bandwidth, but that's a lot lower and "blind merged mining" (if it works) should neutralize it.
IMO all the main chain _needs_ to do is manage the global money supply and store vast fortunes safely. If its primary use is moving coins between much more popular sidechains, I'd consider that a win.
With any update there's a risk of messing up the system, but sidechains internalize those risks and make them opt-in. Bear in mind that the Lightning Network will work over sidechains too.

There's no such thing as underconsumerism. Now all the stuff we buy doesn't last and breaks quickly, and we keep digging new landfills and dumping consumer trash in the ocean. The average person has debts with interest rates higher than inflation instead of savings. Wealth inequality and income inequality are on the rise as money funnels towards the top.
Everything we thought we knew about inflation was wrong... Keynes thought we'd invest it towards infrastructure instead of bonds, and that we'd be working 15 hour weeks. It's destroying the planet and our society. We need a balance between spending and saving, and that will only come from a fixed money supply - not an increasing or decreasing one, and certainly not one controlled by increasingly corrupt institutions.

Just as anyone can optionally become a miner or relay-only node without undermining p2p, anyone can optionally become a LN node without undermining p2p. I think we already agree that not everyone needs to provide the same network services; we just need to be able to. Ideally every user should be a LN node, since we all need at least some money in a hot wallet for everyday purchases anyways.
I'm not disputing that on-chain transactions are more secure than off-chain transactions. However I am arguing that each user is more secure if they validate each transaction in which they're involved, which is more practical with a smaller blockchain. Validating transactions in which they're not involved is wasteful, but necessary to validate blocks; this can be minimized by only putting settlements in blocks.
Why is total storage cost not a problem? Hard drives are cheap but not free, and initially syncing the blockchain takes a non-trivial amount of time. I'll admit it's not the biggest problem, but I also listed relaying, validation, and hashing.

I see your point but you're combining multiple problems.
* Inflation isn't there to provide incentives to government agencies, especially since unspent budgets typically get cut.
* They've ended up spending less money on public goods (like NASA) than Keynes envisioned, and spending more money on defense to maintain dollar dominance. This is the military industrial complex Eisenhower warned about. 
* Public goods are a huge unsolved problem in cryptocurrency. In _theory_, [Bitcoin Hivemind]( should address it by allowing us to insure against a lack of space exploration. So if a full map of Europa would be worth $1 to you, then you bet $1 that it won't be produced. You then either get your map or win the bet, while contributing towards the incentive to fund a probe to Europa. Right now the government kinda-sorta does an OK job at funding public goods, except it's based more on voter feels than on rational cost-benefit analyses.

And there are subs about theism in general. But whether or not Core or XT is The One True Bitcoin is a worthy subject of debate. Neither of them violate the principles described in the whitepaper, they both have reasonable arguments for their position, and they're both based off the same chain to date. I hope just as much as anyone that we can reach a consensus just by talking about it and avoid a contentious hard fork, but there's no incentive to actually do that or even allow discussion if there's no ultimate fail-safe.

He didn't say anything about it being a joke, and price _is_ the best measure of a tradeable thing's utility - that's the subjective theory of value. The price is still volatile because the value of bitcoin is still unclear to investors; it's used more for speculation than for contracts.

I've heard two sides of this. How many members of Core were there, and how were they authorized to speak on behalf of the others?


Doesn't the _recipient_ generate the address, and thus decide if the (edit: next) transaction is segwit or not?
Can someone just send me time locked bitcoins without my permission right now?


I'm not qualified to address which ways are best, maybe u/nullc or u/belcher_ can handle these. Personally I don't object to any improvements which work.


Is just the UTXO thing central planning or is any block size setting central planning? I figured having most of the developers, most of the major businesses, and 95% of miners would help reduce this either way.

I've thought about that a lot actually, I'm doing something similar. The parties I've trusted have strict instructions to not release the coins if they believe I'm being coerced, even if I beg them otherwise.
* Under the legacy legal system my wife can take me for everything I've got anyways. I'm not trying to secure against her; I'm trying to secure against people I never wanted to trust at all.
* Her losing everything due to my death is even worse than me losing everything if she leaves me, because at least then my kids _might_ get some. Maybe I'll have done something bad to deserve it, but they certainly don't deserve to randomly lose a husband/father _and_ all our savings.
* I might at some point become mentally incapacitated - join a cult, head injury, brainwashed, tortured, etc. More frequently, I can be very pigheaded when wrong. I'll be very wrong about something big someday and need someone to keep my coins frozen while they talk me down. I just don't trust some bureaucrat I've never met with the power to freeze my money.
It's not _at all_ a pleasant thing to consider (so many people won't), but one can't completely trust oneself. And that's not really the point, I think - it's having the _choice_ of who to trust and how. We've essentially opted into a set of private divorce arbitrators while our marriage is still intact.

They're both safer and cheaper in different ways.
* On chain is safer for large transfers because there's no need to monitor a channel for cheating attempts. Just wait for confirmation.
* Payment channels are safer for point of sale merchants because it's instantly secure with no chance of a double spend (which miners can always do without RBF). No waiting for confirmations; it's already confirmed.
* On chain is cheaper for infrequent users who won't need multiple transactions any time soon and don't want the overhead of another layer.
* Payment channel payments are cheaper because they can have sub satoshi fees and don't need everyone else to expend resources validating and storing them forever.
Even Gavin has been supportive of Satoshi's payment channel idea because for the right job it's the right tool. Neither is a magic bullet.

_Exactly_. Despite being way more technically competent than the average bitcoiner, DPR still made a lot of huge mistakes. He didn't remain anonymous and chose to use force irrationally.
This is still bitcoin's most prominent attempted hit because of the enormous costs involved - it's nearly impossible to remain anonymous, to safely coordinate with other people, and to determine how much money to offer. The result is physical security that only the rich can afford, and evidently still screw up. That's why I think trust-free prediction markets (or crowdfunding) are essential for large groups to pay for physical security, or else we'll remain in the plutocracy we live in now. Imagine the Walter White that DPR would have become if he had actually succeeded.
I think part of the reason people here are so mad about Garza is because he illustrates one of our weak points - we aren't ready to coordinate against bad guys like him yet. The best we can do right now is just tell people to not do business with him.

We're seeing a better mechanism emerging now with chain split tokens. 
* Having multiple exchanges do it makes it hard to fake.
* More importantly, there's even _more_ at stake when betting than when voting. Miners can vote however they want without internal (personal) consequences - they can even signal that they're running code that they actually aren't, for political reasons.
The UASF took advantage of this principle by betting that Bitcoin would be worth more with Segwit, and soft forks in the near future will probably use BIP 8. In the long run, we'll probably use smart contract chain split tokens, p2p prediction markets, or both.

I think it's like making those long ~~segmented~~ articulated buses (trivial, excludes some streets) vs making double-decker buses (complicated, no footprint change). 
Articulated buses were perhaps the better idea a year ago, but now there's a completed double-decker design that might actually pass the city council vote. Eventually we might need [articulated double-decker buses]( but if we're lucky someone will invent faster lightning-powered buses with side-thrusters that can fly.

That's how they'd lose money - they'd have already spent real (non-refundable) work on a chain that no longer exists. Before the wipe, they'd lose money by mining a less profitable chain (the messy situation that could have happened).


If the miners didn't already activate Segwit before August 1st, the UASF nodes would have treated all non-Segwit blocks as invalid.


It's the only significant change - they're also adding opt-in replay protection but that won't make a huge difference.

No it wasn't. B2X was unnecessary, rushed, and untested. It had one job and didn't even do that without breaking! Most of us are in favor of a block size hard fork eventually.


It makes our hash algorithm immutable too. Have you heard of "forced soft forks"? If we can't PoW fork, then miners can change nearly anything about Bitcoin without anyone else's permission. Against a block size increase? Too bad, validate these extension blocks or else risk losing money.

I absolutely would. When I first started using Bitcoin, it was unclear if it would ever grow beyond crypto nerds, and the monetary inflation rate was still very high. I thought my adoption wave would be the last one in a long time, so the market cap would grow slowly with the economy.
The only reason I'd rather spend dollars than bitcoin today is _because_ I expect the price to go up. If it stayed at $8000, then why hold it more than what's needed for everyday convenience?

I agree with you, sorry if my original post was unclear. I think bitcoin will go up like it has previously because its fundamentals are solid, not solely because it has previously gone up.
I've been watching carefully since 2010, and in my amateur opinion it's _staggering_ that the price has been this low for the last 2 years. There's been a tremendous amount of user adoption, protocol research, investment in bitcoin companies, and legal acceptance. Monetary inflation is now on par with major world currencies. We're looking at better scaling from segwit and the innovations it enables, better fungibility from Schnorr signatures and p2p mixers, better security from cheap multisig hardware wallets, instant secure transactions from LN, and more features in general from sidechains (especially prediction markets). And don't even get me started on the incompetence against which Bitcoin competes.

But for the occasional everyday user who doesn't follow development and doesn't realize they need to upgrade, what's the best outcome?
* They're left on the minority chain but still see payments confirming. They unknowingly sell goods to scammers for nearly worthless minority coins and don't realize the problem until they try to buy something themselves.
* They stop seeing payments confirm. Scammers can only try to buy things with unconfirmed transactions, which many merchants don't accept. "WTF is wrong with Bitcoin, maybe I should Google it or complain on Reddit."

Did you expect some fairy tale about an economic system where we simply ask polluters nicely to stop killing us for profit?
I've described how this works in detail because physical defense is a last resort, that wouldn't be any more frequent than police visits today. In theory if our governments actually represented us, the police _should_ be doing this already. But in reality people vote based on the social group they're in, and legislators are cheap to bribe. That's [a pretty disgusting system](
The polluter can hire his own goons, but since the cost to society from pollution is greater than the benefit to the polluter,
* It would be cheaper to just pay off the insurance market.
* They'd be outgunned if they tried anyways.
And if your heart is still bleeding for those polluters, consider how many people will die if they're allowed to continue polluting at current state-protected levels.

True, at least Dogecoin has inflation to pay for security in lieu of a fee market.
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:02:43
Breaking that down a little bit:
* Insurance customers place a dollar value on a bad outcome. Because money has diminishing marginal utility, it's rational for everyone to insure against severe loss and/or injury.
* Insurers have an incentive to make these bad outcomes less likely, when possible and cost-effective.
* Insurance policies and insurer actions are limited by public laws. An insurer can't pay someone to shut down a polluter in another country without the permission of that country's government.
* Therefore, [censorship-resistant prediction markets]( can serve consumers in ways that existing insurers can't, because their reach isn't limited by governments.
For example let's say Alice is polluting, and earns 4 BTC for herself by creating 10 BTC worth of costs for everyone else. The victims tried asking their governments to make Alice pay restitution, but the governments refused (for whatever reason). So instead they buy insurance against that pollution, and then the insurer puts out a bounty to eliminate Alice's emissions. Instead of having to pay [whatever price Alice demands]( the victims pay someone cheaper to make her stop.

I'm using "insurance" instead of "pinkerton extermination squads" because
* When it's first launched, the volume will be too low to actually fund anyone to take action. It'll be 100% about mitigating risk.
* The average consumer won't have any way of knowing which things they can influence; just which things they want to insure against. For example they might not believe in anthropogenic climate change, but still want to buy insurance against hurricanes. If everyone had to crowdfund all defense, then the transaction costs would be unworkable.
* If for some reason the system fails to stop the pollution, the insured get a payout.
I'm _not_ counting on the average person caring how the sausage is made; I'm counting on them rationally wanting affordable insurance against unfavorable outcomes. Because of lower regulatory costs and overhead, and the general public not trusting existing insurers, it would possibly out-compete more traditional insurance plans too... But that's getting off the topic of environmentalism.


Not any time soon, no. I expect this will streamline the legislator bribery process that currently only caters to the rich, and bribe police officers to focus on crimes that are actually hurting people. [The farther we look into the future, the more we oversimplify]( If this can work at all, then it'll have to work everywhere between three people making almost no difference, and 9 billion people controlling everything decades after the state. 
The world didn't instantly switch from monarchy to democracy. The process was gradual, starting with kings losing power one at a time or giving it up willingly. Now looking back we see kings as completely unreasonable and unfair, but at the time people didn't know any better - some even pointed to the "failure" of democracy in classical antiquity, a step backwards.


This is called [greenwashing]( Unfortunately we can't shame away a tragedy of the commons. 


I hope you're right, and we might both be, if people buying insurance provides an incentive for legislators to actually solve these problems. I don't think you're going to find a lot of environmentalists who think "governments are doing enough, they'll get this under control before we reach a billion climate refugees".

And you see this stupidly misogynistic post on a thread about planning for your loved ones, and decide yeah he's right, trusting a woman you view as your intellectual equal is THE MATRIX. 
I just remember that fateful conversation with my wife in 2011. While _all_ my computer science bros warned me against bitcoin, she was the only one open to this weird new idea. She understood the magnitude of what had happened in a way that few do even today. I still had big doubts, but - like a total pussy OMG - listened to her advice and disregarded my bros. If I hadn't trusted her with major financial decisions, I'd be much _much_ poorer right now. So that guy who "got broke"? That's every man who didn't have a wife as good as mine and missed the boat.

It looks like you're saying that corporations and governments are doing something, but it's _not enough_ to achieve sustainability and they could do much better. If so, then I agree with that.


Are you assuming we can only bet on "better than 2018" and "worse than 2018", but not "above this prediction for 2050" and "below this prediction for 2050"?


Some _markets_ will need to exist for decades, but _individuals_ will be able to enter/exit the market at any point before it matures. That's why a deflationary money supply is necessary for long-term prediction markets. If you want to get into the actual daydream sci-fi stuff; long term prediction markets should eventually fund space exploration that takes decades/centuries to pay off, too.

This is a brilliant article, I think they're completely right. There's a high cost to insurance assessment and a conflict of interest from having the insurer perform it; using smart contracts with tons of individual third-party "assessors" is a great way to lower prices.
But let's not beat around the bush. The real disruption isn't going to be from lower costs, it's going to be the ability to buy insurance policies which are currently illegal or highly regulated. If the government protects someone who pollutes the air for a price lower than its cost to me, then I have an incentive to buy insurance against it. If a law costs the public more than it benefits them, then they'll insure against its continued existence. You'll be able to make a profit by providing unregulated private defense services from pollution. Politicians will be able to anonymously accept bribes from the public for better votes, instead of relying on traditional bribes from economic elites.
The average person's utility will increase, but the privileged who don't believe in markets won't be happy about losing power. They'll shut down any centralized blockchain, and arrest any assessor/reporter whose identity is public. Bitcoin Hivemind has the power to circumvent this censorship, and bring about more social change than we've seen in our lifetimes. Private blockchains don't have the power to do this.

Not everyone, just a large percentage of society. Remember that everyday consumers would be insuring against their own problems, which insurance traders would correlate with root causes.
If we can't rely on people rationally buying insurance, then we sure can't rely on them irrationally going to the trouble of voting.




Some jerk thinking he can pollute for free would fare no better than minority political groups who raise arms against the federal government.
No offense, but you need to compare this against either the status quo or an alternative that you think would work, not a utopia where no one ever needs to defend themselves.

Not many actually are against segwit, especially technically competent people. Most of the argument is...
* Whether or not a UASF in 2 months is too soon to be safe, and 
* If we should negotiate with non-technical arguments to raise the base block size before Bitcoin segwit usage data can be collected.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:14:37
Kinda, but they've compromised. For example Luke-Jr would prefer to drastically _reduce_ block size in the short term with his latest BIP. I'm sure if I asked in a separate post I could find a lot more.
That's the funny thing about compromise between people who want a number drastically reduced (or unchanged) and people who want it drastically raised (or unlimited). There's no "fair" answer besides the engineering one:
* The largest blocks we can safely handle right now [are about 4 MB]( As it gets larger, we get fewer nodes.
* We need to fix UTXO bloat with the segwit discount before we can raise the block size further because [RAM is advancing slower than Moore's law](
* We don't know how nodes will perform after segwit is in full use, so it would be impudent to increase further before we've collected that data.
I'm thinking worst case scenario, it might be helpful to suggest a stress test of Litecoin once nearly all of its merchants are using segwit. Since it's similar to bitcoin, we might see what adverse effects (if any) occur up to 4 MB non-witness (8 MB counting segwit typical use, 16 MB adversarial).
Edit: added adversarial Litecoin segwit limit

Since we're comparing adblock users to shoplifters, I'm interpreting this as the "contract is site's TOS" and "selfish users" assumptions above. 
Helping "shoplifters" is still being an accomplice to theft, even if you give some of the proceeds back. Just because nearly everyone is doing it doesn't make it ethical.
Since "shoplifters" don't care what's fair, they have no reason to participate in this scheme. They get more money if they just keep stealing normally.
So with those assumptions, Brave is both unethical and an irrational choice for users.

Normally I'm a crazy bitcoin cheerleader but our resident naysayers (like are completely right about Brave. These website operators didn't ask for Bitcoin.
If one believes that you're agreeing to the site's terms when you visit it, then Brave doesn't have the site's consent. If it was a fair deal then Brave would allow opting in or out. I suspect if it ever becomes popular, many users will find themselves spoofing user agents.
If one believes that the website agrees to your terms when they respond to your request, then traditional adblockers are cheaper and completely fair.
If one is selfless, then they ought to donate to willing sites in proportion to how useful the site actually is. I go to Erowid once in a few _years_ but it's immensely important.
If one is selfish, then there's no need to pay for something one gets for free. "If everyone did that" is prefacing your argument with a _radically_ superrational fantasy.

Segwit does reduce fees by increasing the block size. Because of supply and demand, any block size increase will reduce fees.
Transaction time can mean two things - time for a new transaction to get confirmed in a block, and time until a transaction is secure enough for a merchant.
* Like any block size increase, it will temporarily reduce the wait time to get in a block, but the queue will eventually grow again. Because of this, the most common school of thought is that the block size should be as big as we can safely raise it, which segwit is for now. Segwit makes future increases safer too.
* No matter how large a block size we get, you'll still have to wait up to 10 minutes to get confirmed in a block. Accepting unconfirmed transactions is secure enough for selling MP3s, but not secure enough for selling jewelry. Segwit enables the Lightning Network, an upgrade that will allow for secure instant transactions.


In the past we eliminated the soft limits, which were just a gentleman's agreement and not actual forks. Segwit is the first block size increase which requires that users upgrade to enjoy the benefit. For some reason the other subreddit has a difficult time either understanding or admitting this. With a "soft fork" upgrade like segwit, users get the benefit once they each upgrade. With a "hard fork" like they're proposing, everyone would have to upgrade first and then we all get the benefit at once.


You'll notice that Bitcoin Core's biggest competitor, Bitcoin Unlimited, has already crashed their entire network several times due to bugs in its short lifetime, and it hasn't even hard forked yet. Financial software is tough to get right, and no one has completed hard forking code yet that a typical expert in this field would consider safe. For example the exchanges expect hard forks to protect against "replay attacks" which cost Coinbase a lot of money in the Ethereum fork. This code wouldn't be simple.
Elegance matters for lightsabers, not money. Segwit is elegant too if you actually understand it, solves problems in the long run and downstream, and is the most thoroughly peer-reviewed and tested upgrade in Bitcoin's history.


It still allows for mining pools and ASICs, and sets us along a path where server farms only make the blocks but aren't required to validate them.


I'd add that they want a base block size increase now because they don't trust Core to do one later. Another way of saying that is they'd like to make a big decision now because they don't trust the next generation of bitcoiners to do it.
I view their position as elitist and short sighted. Users in the future will be smarter than us, better organized, and more able to solve Bitcoin's problems, and the option of increasing the block size will always be on the table.

The same people who bet that a 16-year-old won't damage his car. Insurers calculate the probability of a thing happening, and then quote a price slightly above the cost*probability. They'll just quote a higher price for more expensive or more probable events. _On average_, the house always wins - consumers buy insurance because money has diminishing marginal utility, _not_ because they expect it to be profitable.

We can't just dictate the cost; we have to set limits and then supply/demand will set the cost. Right now miners just have a block size limit, soon they'll have a weight limit (segwit) that dominates over block size limit. What you're proposing is basically a gas limit like Ethereum.

(Disclaimer: I'm not answering for everyone else, I just want your opinion of this possible answer)
Say we ask a bunch of exchanges to offer synthetic BTC-SW and BTC-1MB. If you send them one bitcoin now, then you get one of each synthetic token. If/when the UASF happens, they're each exchangeable for their respective chain. If the UASF is completely successful then BTC-1MB will be worth 0, and if it doesn't happen at all then BTC-SW will be worth 0. On flag day, each pool looks at the exchanges for if BTC-SW is worth more than BTC-1MB. This would work even better than Bitfinex's synthetic BU offer because there are specific fork dates.
It's decentralized _enough_ because multiple entities could offer it, including darknet participants. Assuming exchanges use similar rules, the exchange rate is objective and the process I describe is deterministic (although performed manually). It's not trustless, but could feasibly be done with smart contracts or even ETH/ETC if that's a big problem.
I understand this isn't as simple as PoW, but that only tells us what's profitable for miners within the life of their depreciating hardware. It doesn't reflect everyone, and it doesn't strictly predict the actual price. Segwit will increase the supply of blockchain space and ease LN, which will likely reduce fees for months before the price goes up to compensate (well up more than it's going right now anyways).

That's what I meant by increasing the scale - we'd update the protocol to allow for amounts smaller than a satoshi. This hasn't been done yet because it would be a waste of file size.
There's also the possibility that by then most commerce will take place on sidechains (or off-chain) and we'd only need the main blockchain to settle large balances, but we'll see I guess.

The header is the first part of a block that miners download, after which they download all of its transactions. During this transaction download time they want to be hashing something, so they just build an empty block - this is the only way to know it doesn't accidentally include the same transactions as the previous one. Once the previous block is done downloading, they'll build a new block with transactions in it and start mining that instead.


Period period space But transaction ordering is one of the few things miners _do_ have a say in. There's no "official" next block, and not all nodes have the same unspent transactions in memory anyways, so we _have_ to leave that part up to miners.

In the off chance a reader finds this convincing, I'd like to point out that pyramid schemes internalize the benefits of new recruits to people directly above them on the pyramid. Bitcoin on the other hand has a "tragedy of the commons" for recruitment - if you buy bitcoin and don't recruit, you gain equal benefits as someone who did recruit, so everyone else anywhere in the scheme benefits.
So if a wealthy bitcoiner is pitching the idea to a bunch of fiat whales, their recruiting time may be well spent; Winklevoss ETF for example. But if your average "bought in 2014 nobody" is telling other middle class people to buy, he's probably sincerely trying to help them... and also probably failing miserably, because people have been trained to ignore non-expert financial advice.
That's why I don't really try to convince people to buy bitcoins anymore. When it comes up in conversation I'll concisely make my point, and I'll happily answer people's questions, but in my sad experience no one has wanted my unsolicited advice. My time is better spent reading here, understanding which objections are legitimate and cooperating to fix the problems that _do_ exist.

I have read it. Why link to a Reddit discussion when you can go straight to the BIP:


A split remains a possibility to blackmail _the miners_, but it's not the goal, just the game theory.
If you and I are acting rationally, then we evaluate each proposed change based on its technical merit; if it's good for Bitcoin.
* If not, then the market will prefer the original chain and there's no need to worry.
* If so, then it's irrational for us to decide based on whose profits are helped/harmed.
If segwit is beneficial and and miners _aren't_ just preserving ASICBOOST, then there shouldn't be a split. Blockstream (assuming that's the customer to whom you refer) seems to have pivoted to federated sidechains anyways, which don't require segwit.

I'm not a lawyer, but I can understand not returning it. The cost to the consumer isn't just the cost of the miner; it's their time, opportunity cost, and the risk unwillingly imposed by the backdoor too.
It bothers me when someone screws a customer over and says "but I gave them their money back!" If the product and secret risk was only worth the money they paid, then they never would have bought it! Selling a product with a backdoor is immensely sleazy and the customers deserve a lot more than just what they paid.

You realize you're holding a mirror up, showing me the exact arguments I made myself a few years ago? If anything you're making a case for Amir, because you're an intelligent reasonable person who has evidently not done his homework or thought this through.
If you honestly think bitcoin is the same as gold, then you need to ask yourself why bitcoin even exists. Gold has high transaction costs when traded directly, high auditing costs when issued as a banknote, and such prohibitive security costs that it grinds to a halt when declared to be destructive hoarding. If your answer to bitcoin's existence is trite and condescending, you're doing yourself a huge disservice.
The typically-cited inefficiencies and coordination problems with anarchy can be addressed with smart contracts, like assurance contracts and prediction markets. I'm not going to pretend to have perfect answers, or that all of this is ready, done, and clearly illustrated. But I think if you actually try to understand, you'll find that the problems which are laughably obvious to someone who actually knew what they were talking about aren't as insurmountable as they were with gold.
With all due respect, there are too many trolls on this sub for me to argue all day with everyone who makes these same arguments over and over. If you're a real historian, please PM me with proof of your real-life qualifications and I'll take you seriously enough to explain everything bit by bit.

I share those concerns. Hopefully the BU guys are right about miners wanting to maximize the value of their investment with realistic limits.
There is one possible advantage to sidechain scaling, though; the bandwidth requirement can be split up between multiple locations. I don't need to download ABC, I can just download A and then outsource B and C. If I'm buying the requisite hashes from multiple parties, they have a truthcoin-like incentive to all report the same honest result, especially since they have no way of knowing how many delegates I've hired.
The only thing we'd _all_ have to download is "tugboat bitcoin", and non-mining nodes would be paid for their contribution. They in turn would pay other delegates for nth-level sidechain hashes. 
I realize this is amateur hand-waving, but I think there's a solution out there.

I've had this discussion several times with bankers, lawyers, doctors, lots of smart educated people. Most of them don't see a problem with trusting the system that led to their success in the first place, so they don't see much need/benefit from bitcoin. The people who would actually benefit the most from a change don't understand how the legacy banking system works.
Let's admit it; many of us are here because that system screwed us over at some point and we don't think it's fair. Maybe you use a safe drug that's illegal, or send money to a legitimate country that's unpopular, or had problems with credit and usury.

The worst thing that can happen to bitcoin is a 51% attack. Fortunately we aren't there yet, but miner centralization increases this risk and segwit helps reduce it.
At this point I don't care about being the biggest chain. We're not the biggest currency anyways. I care about money which is _fair_, and that's where I'll put my savings. As an engineer having watched this debate for years, I see no valid technical objections left against segwit.

Wishful thinking has gotten me into too much trouble already. :-P I'll just assume SF SW is plausible instead of forgetting about it ever activating.
I'd consider blocking SF SW a threat because I think it's a Pareto improvement, so holding it back is only useful as a negotiation tactic. "Give us what we want, or we'll block something that hurts no one and helps many." The HF version isn't a Pareto improvement because it forces users to upgrade or risk losing money.
I understand that the HF version is more elegant code and theoretically safer, but IMHO scaling is urgent enough that we should take some risks to roll it out faster. We'll need a supermajority of miners either way, but with a soft fork we don't need node operators to explicitly support it - just to not block it. Assuming no bugs, how would the actual functionality be different?

You're making assumptions about my assumptions! :-) I'm just surprised that someone is threatening to block segwit without a timely hard fork but _not_ rallying behind BIP109.
Absent any other context, "much" of the hashing power could still be referring to Classic miners anyways.  Which hard fork _do_ they support, and what percentage of the hashing power are they? If "much" is &lt;5% (or even &lt;50%!), then they might not stop anything. I'll "forget it" once _significantly_ more information is available than the link you posted.

This seems to indicate that you _do_ care how they raise money - you're concerned about how they'll fund the creation of [public goods]( without an artificial monopoly. Instead of borrowing money for R&amp;D ahead of time and paying it back with monopoly sales, they would lock in 100% of the R&amp;D costs ahead of time and there would be no need for a monopoly at all.


In the case of the phone, the idea is just the specs, which aren't necessarily secret and are often advertised ahead of time. I'm sure you're familiar with product requirements that come from top down. If your idea is truly revolutionary you can briefly keep it a trade secret and have a superior first-mover advantage.


That's because I completely understand your point, I've been there, everyone already knows why patents exist... You're condescendingly explaining something we all learn during introductory econ.


Because now with smart contracts (including prediction markets and assurance contracts) the transaction costs that were preventing Coasian solutions are fading away, and free market alternatives can fare much better. _That's_ what's changing - lower transaction costs, because of cryptography.

Apple would raise the money to develop the iPhone ahead of time with an assurance contract or prediction market. Like Kickstarter, but in this case it would be mostly phone manufacturers making bids because the new design would increase their profits. Some Apple fanboys or distributors might pitch in too. Since Apple has a great reputation, they'd have an easier time than most raising the money. So the contract here _only enforces the pledges_, it doesn't physically stop anyone from making phones. Before you say "free rider", please read my links. This addresses the public goods problem to replace patents/copyrights.
Then there's authenticity - what is currently handled by trademark. You want to buy a good iPhone, one manufactured by someone with a reputation for quality and not a cheap knockoff. So you check the phone's colored coin to see that the phone was made at a good factory, one that has the blessing of an Apple auditor. If they used smart property, when you pay for it the phone can only be operated by you.

If the UASF activates with a mining minority, then miners can short the 1MB chain and then join the segwit chain to destroy the 1MB fork.

The unsatisfying thing is, they'll change their tune. You see, they were right _at the time_; bitcoin just wasn't ready and has since been improved by becoming more like them. Anyone who claimed bitcoin was a good idea years ago is still wrong _based on the information available at the time_. If you put all your chips on one investment and it paid off dramatically that doesn't mean _their_ whole career is founded on bullshit - you just made one good "guess". 
Any claim you make that you were right all along will need to be proven in their language, not yours... meaning they were always right and you just lucked out despite being stupid. Grrrr unfair!
Let them have it. This is what bitcoin holders are getting paid to endure. You can't simultaneously think that bitcoin is the future, these guys will come to their senses, and that they aren't delusional right now.

Adam gave the official response, but I've been second-guessing this too. I think a more objective and decentralized definition might suit bitcoin better.

Deposits are now taxed to discourage hoarding. Major hot wallet providers get a knock on the door. You must now choose:
* pay deposit taxes and every beer you buy is tracked
* pay massive transaction fees for normal purchases, and crippling massive transaction fees if you use coinjoin
* trust a darknet hot wallet provider
A bitcoin where 99% of transactions go through centralized servers is essentially the same as a gold standard. The supply is theoretically fixed, but it exists with permission. The average user won't be smarter than the average Evolution user; there will be fractional reserve even though it's avoidable and hacks even though they're avoidable. But you've got to use one of the banks who settle with each other off-chain or pay the massive fees; you like Coinbase's compliance, right?
Personally I'd rather risk losing my coins to an improbable sustained 51% attack than a very probable hot wallet hack or herd compliance. Sidechains are necessary for bitcoin _as we know it_ to scale worldwide.

Sure they will. If I'm dumb and get hacked/scammed, I get my money back and the credit card company hunts for the identity thief. The way I see it we (bitcoiners) have four options:
* Pretend we'll never get hacked/scammed, pretend mainstream users won't, and declare it's not a problem.
* Self-insure with multiple cold wallets (what a hassle!)
* Buy into a big fraud insurance scheme with a common percentage fee (like credit cards)
* Buy individually-quoted theft insurance (not yet available?)
These work well for exchanges - BitStamp uses self-insurance, Circle and Coinbase have deposit insurance. At the moment I think theft insurance for individuals would be the best fit for bitcoin. It's decentralized, and insurance assessors can do better than a credit card's 3% if they audit my security. Right now we're paying high credit card fees because of adverse selection - as more people switch to irreversible payment methods this will get more severe. 
By moving fraud prevention from the supermarket clerk who needs to see my drivers license, to someone who only polices fraud all day, we can reduce adverse selection and identity verification costs. The supermarket clerk would specialize in trading irreversible carrots for irreversible bitcoin, my identity would be checked less frequently but more thoroughly, and the fees we pay for fraud would depend on each person's security literacy. 90% of mainstream grandmas would just insure a hardware wallet.

They did think of that, but decided to go with what seemed like the safer option at the time.
* BIP 9 has a lower risk risk of a chain split. IIRC it only happened once, temporarily.
* Miners _used_ to be great about activation per BIP 9. It's only now that the change influences their now-significant fees, and makes a mining bug exploit less effective, are they hesitant to activate.

* Worst-case scenario where Bitmain controls 95%+ of the hashpower and the difficulty readjustment period for a UASF becomes unrealistic, forcing us to PoW fork.
* More realistic scenario, the recent rally has bought us time, since pretty much every miner who bought hardware in the last few months should be in the black.
* Best-case scenario, the miners fall in line and there's no split.

I don't disagree with your revised comment. We shouldn't need to trust anyone regarding cryptocurrency.
Regarding enabling federation: I don't think any additional opcodes should be required; federation already works in bitcoin using regular multisig. Open-Transactions was planning this YEARS ago. IIRC Blockstream's business model is to create a good open-source product and then sell support for it, like Red Hat.
I don't think Drivechain and Liquid cater to the same markets. Liquid isn't really adding any new functionality/scaling to Bitcoin; just improving efficiency. Liquid customers wouldn't want to trust miners with their money (they already need to trust exchanges), and the general bitcoin-using public would never accept federations for everyday commerce. IMHO the Blockstream employees on the bitcoin development mailing list have been very cooperative with Drivechain development.

Sidechains don't necessarily require that all bitcoin nodes know the state of the sidechain. 
* Federated sidechains already work, relying on trusted third parties to secure the peg. It's more for business to business and not secure enough for the general public.
* SPV sidechains were originally supposed to be developed by Blockstream, which rely on proof that a lot of mining power supports each block (not that it's valid). But disappointingly it seems to have been pushed aside for Liquid, a federated sidechain.
* My favorite proposal right now is Drivechain, which only relies on most miners supporting the chain without special proofs. In practice it might be just as secure as SPV sidechains, and it's a lot simpler. Rootstock plans to transition to it from a federated sidechain.
* I think eventually zk-SNARK sidechains will be best; the zk-SNARK proves that the sidechain block is valid without having to download the whole thing. Zero knowledge proofs are still cutting edge stuff so it'll be years before we see this in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:06:33
My hypothesis: 
* Mainstream folks will gradually decide bitcoin is still alive and worth considering as the price rises. 
* The price rises (generally) as bitcoin becomes more useful and uncertainty fades away.
* Being able to scale makes bitcoin more useful for payments, while the risk of a contentious fork makes it a worse store of value. 
* Therefore, a consensus on scaling _should_ lead to wider mainstream acceptance.

The main issues with ASICBOOST are that [it's patented and that it discourages upgrades like segwit](
If Bitstream merges a UASF that would make Bitcoin less valuable, then anyone can create an incompatible soft fork. 
* Speculators will bet on which one will be more valuable, 
* this will raise its price higher than the Bitstream version, 
* it will attract more miners and thus have a longer chain, 
* and this wins over any fence-sitters who haven't upgraded either way.
IMHO having cryptocurrency speculators bet on which forks will succeed is healthier than having miners vote. We want to optimize Bitcoin price, not mining revenue.
BCC would have had more game theory on its side if it used extension blocks and prohibited segwit signaling, but it's still a better way to resolve disputes than what we've been doing.

* storing your labor anywhere you choose, without having to trust anyone?
* secure timestamping?
* unbreakable programmable contracts (like Lighthouse)?
* ability to prove reserves to anyone online?
These are just off the top of my head, so I'm sure you could find more. My point is that bitcoin does solve some real problems already, and it's not even version 1.0 yet. Do PayPal stock shares generate wealth?
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:32:20
Even though it isn't works right now,
* Lighthouse still only supports &lt;700 pledges because of the block size, so the min pledge is relatively high.
* Sadly, not all public goods are worth funding. In this case there are other decentralized exchange projects that could work. Personally I'm a huge fan of Open Transactions, which has already been in development for years. If Bitsquare doesn't get funded, it's probably because it's not worth enough money to enough people.

The difference is [seigniorage]( Satoshi made a reasonable effort to publicize his whitepaper before launch. The Genesis Block itself is unspendable. He and Hal Finney paid the market price (in CPU cycles) for those early bitcoins, there just weren't a lot of interested buyers. 
ICO tokens, on the other hand, are typically created at no cost to their organizers and then sold at a profit. Something like Counterparty where the tokens are created by burning Bitcoins, or like Litecoin where the launch is publicized before mining commences, offers equal rules for everyone.

BIP148 needs enough segwit signaling blocks before segwit expires (by date) or they're forced to hard fork.
* If the miners attack, then BIP148 gets those blocks and will retain the ability to reorg after activation.
* If the miners ignore, then even BIP148 fails to activate segwit and its users hard fork, losing the ability to reorg forever.

It isn't the same thing at all. To name a few differences...
* It screws up market cap calculations because a large portion of those initial coins are still owned by the foundation. Even _moving_ them could hurt the price, let alone selling them.
* It reduces the coin's reputation for fairness because it's much easier for the foundation (or insiders) to trust itself with an IOU than it is for you to trust them with the same IOU.
* It benefits people who are more willing to gamble on other people's integrity than on technical/economic viability.
* When the hard fork happened, it gave the foundation a huge advantage because it was expected that the foundation might sell coins on the original fork if it survived.
* There's no way to know if the foundation engaged in price discrimination.

~~LMGTFY is patronizing and best not used for when~~ you "clumsily" describe something completely different from the new goalposts. Copy/paste isn't punching in an address - for large values that punching is time well spent.
When withdrawing from cold storage, you should either carefully check or manually type the address; hopefully BIP70 will further reduce the occurrence of incorrect addresses as well. The risk shrinks relative to the required skill every year...

Sorry lady, we're just _so entitled_ that we had to join an opt-out to your wealth redistribution pyramid scheme. So many Boomers have told me to not count on Social Security to be there when I retire, that it seems bizarre they think we'd willingly support it for just another 30 years. 
The system is obviously broken but they think it works "well enough" to last one more generation... they're bullshitting us. They sold us out, and now have the nerve to call _us_ lazy now that the gravy train has reached its end of low wages and high unemployment.
This has been in the making since the Fed was established and the New Deal was struck, and then the Nixon Shock began the end right under their noses. Well if it's got to end sometime, then perhaps we'd rather it be before we toil our whole lives for a lie too. You can keep holding that hot potato, thank you.

This is a combination of True Scotman and exaggeration. 


The impression I got from the MIT guy is that he was being very polite and mature, while helping to build something nasty and bullshitting us about it. You're appealing to MIT's authority now, that a proposal coming from them shouldn't receive the same response as if it came from anywhere else. If you think we're concerned about their influence you've got us all wrong.


Like that conspiracy that Liberty Reserve and e-gold stepped on the wrong toes, and their shutdown was not to protect consumers? Bitcoin exists because at least one conspiracy theory was true - that the government was deliberately suppressing alternatives to inflationary currency worldwide. If you're in the habit of dismissing conspiracy theories, then bitcoin probably appeared to come out of nowhere - a "black swan" because no one (who counts) thought it necessary.
Since we're making broad generalizations about the community... I get the impression they don't care who you are, how confident you are, whether or not you want to sell your coins, how important you think winning people over is, or how much they remind you of other groups you've met in the past. They only care if you can support a logical argument with actual evidence. You made a crazy assertion, tried to shirk the burden of proof, doubled down with your own fantastic theory from the last year's prices, and then insulted _their_ critical thinking skills! I can't speak for everyone else, but I'll treat bullshitters like garbage no matter how rich or influential they are - that's why I prefer a system that relies on "appeals to math".

Why isn't the Bitnodes Incentive Program working? I stopped using it because I was creeped out by all the hacking attempts on port 80, but I'm still running a high scoring node because idealism.
Would people be more likely to run a Bitnodes Incentive node if:
* registration didn't require constantly running a webserver,
* they were micropayments instead of a lottery, or
* the average reward was higher?
We tend to look at node incentives like it requires a perfect long-term decentralized solution, but I think that crowdfunded (Lighthouse?) central entities might work well enough until we can use Oracles or other crazy future stuff.

Would you please elaborate as to how trading fiat currency for bitcoin is a threat to bitcoin? If bitcoin is so great it should survive whatever sorts of trade people want to make with it.

So you're against greed and distraction, which is why you exclusively support the altcoin trade. Got it.


Ok, if that's what you want... it sounds like you're whining about solutions you dislike without offering realistic alternatives. By all means, say something useful or at least provide a link.

@_date: 2016-07-21 16:47:09
I agree, but the one true solution just isn't available yet. A few ideas being worked on off the top of my head...
* Lifting the block size cap won't eliminate orphans, so miners would limit block sizes naturally anyways.
* LN has a lot of moving parts that haven't even all been coded yet.
* Sidechains are still completely federated, but p2p sidechains eventually [might be the best solution](
Hopefully the small boost from segwit will last until one of these happens.
@_date: 2016-07-06 11:39:10

How do we know the safe maximum with segwit before collecting real-world segwit usage data? Can we reasonably assume that Litecoin usage will be similar?

SegWit is a very minor scalability enhancement, but it's necessarily for the Lightning Network and sidechains. LN moves the scaling goalposts from tx/s to users/s.

Back in 2011, it was that TPTB wouldn't allow it to exist, and their 51% attack would destroy the network even at a loss. This was when CPU mining was still feasible and bitcoin ASICs didn't exist.
(Various security-related objections over the years that I don't completely remember... Sorry.)
In 2014, it was that SHA256 would eventually break.
* If we don't switch algos quickly, we're at the mercy of whoever broke it, and there's a good chance they'd like to make a lot of money by shorting and 51% attacking.
* If we switch to a whole new hash algo, the return to CPU mining brings us back to TPTB attack from 2011. 
* Even if we switched to Scrypt, there's a chance _that_ algo is broken too. 
We're at risk of severe financial instability because we never know which hash algorithms are actually secure. Maybe SHA256 is already broken and they're just getting cheap coins while waiting for the right time to pull the rug out from under us. Maybe they're working farther and farther backwards right now, to steal coins from everyone who acquired them since the last hard checkpoint.
Sure, you and I know that a 51% attack is recoverable, that they'd eventually run out of broken hash algorithms and we'd end up with one that works. But if you're not a "true believer", how long would you be willing to wait? After seeing the crash to end all crashes, would you believe us? We have no way of knowing if they've actually run out of ammunition, or if they're just waiting to stomp it out again. Now please invest in our bitcoin companies.
I fear that we won't have any such certainty until we actually start crowdfunding high-level crypto leaks. Or once people in power - either financial or intelligence - start to feel the heat. When they start to feel real change coming to society. But I fear even more a future where I did nothing to fight against these monsters, where I allowed them to just walk all over us for my whole life. I might be a n00b who can barely set up an Ubuntu server, but that's a lot more than most people and I have a moral responsibility to fight as best I can for what's right. Ultimately I don't think it's the technology that will win this fight - it _has_ to be people who actually believe in its goals.

Bitcoin doesn't have anything to do with [who owns the factors of production]( For example a left-libertarian might support taxes on the consumption of natural resources, but not taxes on human labor. This would make him a socialist but not incompatible with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is market-based, period. You could even argue that it's inherently market anarchist, but it's not necessarily anarcho-_capitalist_. Nothing about the blockchain will protect your physical property rights, and when bitcoin takes over I expect natural resources will be controlled by whoever is willing to pay the most, not by who _willingly_ buys and sells it.

You're right about federated pegs, I was just providing that for context. Are  you sure you didn't mean to say soft fork? Even extension blocks are a soft forking change.
Blockstream &amp; Drivechain: Yes, nodes need to know something about each sidechain - its balance and validity - but since the proof for that is constructed the same way for each sidechain, only one upgrade is required. Bitcoin might only merge two types of sidechains ever - Blockstream/Drivechain, and zk-SNARKs.

That's an interesting point, so please forgive my amateur rambling exploration of the idea:
The cost/benefit of self-insurance depends on the risk of being hacked versus the % higher prices from CC fees... which also deter business and cause a deadweight loss as I'm sure you're aware. With good cold storage practices (Trezor), self-insurance can be easy and with negligible risk, way below 1% average loss and low max losses if you spread out your cold wallets.
There's also adverse selection at work when insuring against users' own mistakes. Let's say everyone using credit cards upgrades to ApplePay (or similar), eliminating the user's risk of fraud from merchant insecurity. At that point, the ApplePay fee will approach the chances that the average user will be hacked, which creates an incentive for above-average users to self insure, and % fees spiral upwards. ApplePay could start tailoring fees to individuals, but those fees will always be higher than the highest chance your phone will be hacked in order to maintain profits.

There's no denying that the incentives created by inflation/deflation are different. The saver is worse off when the government increases inflation. 




Even holding gold or low-yield bonds involves risk because their value could feasibly decrease. Money I enjoy right now doesn't have that risk. 
But the main sacrifice to merit this reward isn't risk, it's deferred consumption; someone else gets to enjoy the nice stuff before the saver does. 


If it helps the discussion at all, I personally vary my investments because I could be completely wrong about Bitcoin. 




Right, I'm not disputing that bank security is generally very good. Since you can't insure a personal stash yet, the best solution I can recommend is self-insurance with multiple wallets. I understand that this too cumbersome for the average person. I'm not sure if an expanded insurance industry falls under the "banking" umbrella.




You're might be right. I only think p2p lending would be sufficient if lending and borrowing was far less common in general. How would you describe the scaling problems? Maybe it's something fixable.

I'm not assuming a zero-sum game. Altcoins have existed since long before Bitcoin fees were significant; extremely high (IMHO) fees tell us that demand is nonetheless inelastic.
* For the wealthy, a more stable store of value is much more important than low on-chain transaction fees; that stability comes from market depth that doesn't require high on-chain capacity. 
* The biggest everyday markets which actually require bitcoin's censorship resistance are darknet markets. Their transactions are off-chain and centralized. 
I'll admit it's not an ideal situation - we _should_ decentralize all the things with OpenBazaar and Bitsquare - but right now bitcoin is being used to denominate accounts and occasionally transfer value between those accounts. I want the same thing you do - increase the max block size, people actually being their own banks and not trusting third parties; not getting Goxed/frozen by exchanges and exit scammed by DNMs. But our vision of what it ought to be doesn't change how forces are actually shaping the market.
That's just my argument; it's not evidence. But we also don't have evidence for how much a bitcoin will be worth if the block size is increased, or how high the fees will be in a year if it isn't. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if 2018 mining rewards are more fee than subsidy, or if a blocksize increase didn't significantly impact those two use cases.

Try defending yourself from a polluter and we'll see how much the government doesn't intervene. Emissions are part of the reason I got so interested in cryptocurrency in the first place - we need global prediction markets for pollution so everyday people can insure against it and create incentives for private groups to provide security.
For the sake of argument let's assume anthropogenic climate change is real - if you disagree please replace it with some other sort of global environmental problem.
* You use a prediction market to insure against higher sea levels because they would destroy your home.
* Conditional prediction markets allow middlemen to bet on whether or not higher sea levels will happen IFF global carbon emissions go up. They are only betting on the relationship between these two variables and are insulated from other risks.
* Regional emissions influence whether or not global emissions go up. So the results of "will Metropolis have high emissions" will influence "will Earth have high emissions" in a conditional prediction market.
* Local events influence regional emissions, so middlemen bet on whether or not "concrete production in Metropolis to halt" will influence "will Metropolis have high emissions".
* Thus with efficient prediction markets, your buying insurance against higher sea levels creates an incentive for people in Metropolis to halt concrete production somehow. If polluters don't like this they can also insure against it, pushing the burden to reduce emissions on someone who benefits less from polluting.
The government isn't protecting us from pollution - they're allowing it to continue. Since polluters have more political influence than you do and will stop at nothing to protect their profits, this insurance mechanism needs to be decentralized, low transaction cost, trust-free, and global. It has to be something they can't shut down when they realize what's happening. Please, call me crazy and do nothing for a few years.
TL;DR: Cryptocurrency will end pollution externalities and solve _many_ other public goods problems.

Signature bloat isn't just an attack vector; storing information permanently on the blockchain is extremely useful even to legit fee-paying users.


Then you have a de facto limit for which miners still need to optimize. In exchange for this higher limit, we'd have to hope that what is profitable for miners is below what nodes can support. It's possible that individuals would be willing to pay high fees for large signatures, individual miners would find these &gt;4MB blocks profitable to mine (including orphan rate), and nodes would drop off - a negative externality.

I'm glad we agree that the multitude of arguments against 2x can't all be dismissed as "ego". 
To small blockers, segwit's block size increase _is_ a compromise. Keep in mind that the dev who figured out segwit's increase wants to _decrease_ the block size for now; if we compromise with him, then maybe we could just decrease it a little bit.
So we need logical reasons to decide on _which_ compromise. Testing out what happens with a small increase before increasing it even more (and in a novel way) is a reasonable, common sense approach. Besides technical arguments, I could be convinced to support 2x if it had a chain split token (like BU) but with a higher expected future price than the legacy chain.

Although only a minority of Bitcoin transactions are people actually buying stuff, this forms the base of its utility which supports its speculative value. Even those few users buying illegal stuff with mixers are doing so in greater volume than with other coins with built-in privacy.
IMHO a part of that speculative value comes from expected upgrades that will make privacy easier and cheaper - ring signature sidechains, onion lightning network routing, confidential transactions, etc. You have a point; I'm not pretending like mixers are a perfect solution, just that they're the best option for actual privacy-minded vendors today.

* You're rewarded for saving instead of punished, so there's less reason to lend and borrow
* Physical security is much less of an issue due to encryption and backups
* Peer to peer lending doesn't require trusting a middleman
I'm using a bank because it keeps my money safe, holds a stable value, and makes it easy to pay bills... not for the near-zero interest rate it offers. If the price ever stabilizes or bitUSD becomes trustless, and enough landlords/utilities accept it, then I'm not sure what I'll need banks for.

The estimate sounds reasonable, but I think it's extremely unlikely that the scaling debate will be resolved any time soon. BIP148 and BU are both going to fail. The market has priced this in, and it's still soaring even though transaction fees are soaring too. If miners simply stall, I expect the dollar value of their fees will be more than 4x the current dollar value of the subsidy.

The person holding wealth contributed to society when they initially earned it, and then every day they decided to forego consumption so that someone else could consume right now.
When we take away the realistic option to just save money, then people who want to save the value of their labor end up trusting someone who says they can preserve it... Like the housing market.

It was even more obvious that everyone explicitly agreed to code as written, not as intended. They went out of their way to opt out of that subjectivity. You can opt into subjective rulings in an objective system (multisig escrow), but you can't opt into objective rulings in a subjective system (Ethereum).

Personally I see altcoins as laboratories for new features. If those features are useful, they'll eventually make their way into sidechains and maybe even the main blockchain. But during the period between altcoin launch and sidechain support, the altcoin is solving a real problem and is positive-sum. We're seeing that right now with Monero's user-friendly privacy and Ethereum's Turing complete smart contracts.
If you can identify which features will have a market in between now and when the sidechain is well tested, then you can make money investing in alts beyond the zero-sum game of hot potato that most of them are.

Welcome to Bitcoin! The C is not capitalized.


You'll typically want to use a higher fee for exchanging bitcoin than just moving it within your own wallets. You can escrow the coins, wait for it to confirm, and then meet to exchange the cash.
There's also an upgrade coming soon which will allow you to confirm your transactions ahead of time, and then spend your coins instantaneously later (the "Lightning Network").

@_date: 2015-02-02 17:36:07
The same argument could be made against bitcoin's digital signatures - we don't know which crypto the NSA/CIA has broken, and a drained wallet can usually be blamed on some other sort of hack. Only leaks can tell us what's broken.
If you're honestly worried they'd risk a secret to catch you that they'd rather save for actual terrorists, then I don't think ring signatures will be enough.

You can't cancel those transactions yet. They're adding features that will allow you to do that in the future, but in the meantime you might have to wait a few days and try again. 
Until the coins you sent are actually mined in a block, they still technically belong to you. Transactions get stuck like this to prevent "double spends" where a thief tries to send the same bitcoin to two people at once.

The miners deciding the rules part. Miners just order transactions - your client decides the rules. Ultimately the cryptocurrency exchange markets will decide what's "Bitcoin" and what's "BTC-2".
I don't think Core would be the ones causing the risk - they can't be expected to change every time someone else changes their software. It's the same situation with the BIP148 UASF. The one who changes the consensus rules is the one forcing a market decision. Bitcoin users won't meekly follow whatever they're pressured to do.
If nearly all the miners hard fork and Core is looking at month-long block periods, they'll have to hard fork alright... but there's no reason to follow the same hard fork. They don't view blocks that large as prudent yet, and they won't want to encourage stopping all commerce so everyone can update their software. They'd PoW fork with a bundled ASICBoost fix.

* It's harder for 51% of miners to collude than it is for 2 of 3 companies, and we already trust miners to do other stuff anyways. 
* Drivechain is designed such that miner attacks must be slow, conspicuous, and obvious, giving the community time to switch hash algorithms and defeat the miners' attempt at theft.
If you've been following the Ethereum disaster you'll notice that main chains aren't any more secure in this regard; 51% of miners were about to freeze someone's funds until they discovered a huge DoS flaw in the soft fork, and they'll most likely do it anyways with a hard fork. What really matters is if there's a community consensus that agreements ought to be honored even when they're inconvenient - for contractors, miners, holders, everybody.

Incorrect; an incompatible soft fork can be made. For example, "block at height X must have nonce Y", similar to the checkpoints we used to have.

Principles and precedent _are_ economically relevant. They inform the public what to expect in the future and influence adoption. We already know where unprincipled short-term thinking leads.
Segwit isn't particularly complex, yet it's the most tested code in Bitcoin's history anyways, _and_ it's already live in altcoins. It's simple to do a hard fork dangerously; where's the replay protection code?
Are you denying that segwit includes an on-chain scaling bump? That's the whole reason it merits data collection before another bump.
Proprietary sidechains are conspiracy nonsense. There's no point in a blockchain without censorship resistance for the vast majority of the public. Literally no one would want to use those for regular commerce.
The implication that protocol developers have narrow coding expertise is laughable. Do you think one needs more than cheap power and ASICs to be a miner?
In a Bitcoin PoW fork, botnets would dominate until FPGAs and ASICs emerge again. A box of GPUs wouldn't make a dent.

Not once did Circle give me any trouble about it, and they even increased my buying limit.

It's not perfectly inelastic, but like I said, the rapid and steep increase in fees tells us how elastic it actually is. We can't both complain about that while also claiming that it's elastic.
The reasons to use Bitcoin to pay for your Dell laptop are very weak, and without a Bitcoin discount it's a worse deal than credit cards with consumer protection. The two use cases I stated above are both much stronger than typical payments which aren't censored and don't require a stable value. We just lost the right side of the demand curve.

That's accomplished one of two ways:
* [Reduce the witness discount]( which would preserve an incentive for UTXO bloat.
* Add an additional optimization goal for miners (max fees within both block weight AND block size) which makes building a block much more complicated.
That's why segwit's adversarial block size limit of 4 MB doesn't equal the expected average of 2 MB. The engineering goal was to make it as efficient as possible, not just maximize block size.

If it's imperfect, but gets the job done, then it's "good enough". Where are the MtGox coins? What % of XMR's market cap would you move through it and expect to remain unnoticed?
I'm not disputing that the Bitcoin Core client would benefit from more built-in privacy features, but the hoop of going through a mixer seems easier to jump through than the hoop of going through an alternative cryptocurrency. If _trust_ is the problem then you can use CoinJoin (although it may have a severe vulnerability right now :-P). Unless of course you're arguing Monero maximalism, in which case we should be expected to jump ledgers every time marginally better privacy is developed. If Bitcoin was in danger of being overtaken, it would very likely hard fork to adopt Monero's features; I don't think an open-source cryptocurency can overtake another open-source cryptocurrency.
To me, the risk of an even more private blockchain coming out is _even more reason_ to stay away in the first place. At any minute the price of XMR could drop to near-zero because everyone who wants "the best" will flock there instead, leaving you holding the bag.

Do you not understand his explanation or do you have a rebuttal?

Story time?

They took out the ads, and you can check the source.

Would I be correct to interpret your position as:
Over the long term, the Bitcoin Unlimited node software is intended for miners only, since it validates long-confirmed blocks instead of accepting whatever miners have deemed profitable.
You would accept a payment taken from someone else's cold storage without their signature, if it was on a well-confirmed block (say, 1,000,000 confirmations on the most worked chain).
Market failures (like prisoner's dilemmas) can't happen in Bitcoin mining.

I deliberately left those out because I think they will fail. If you think they've been censored here and will work, then you should go buy their tokens.

That's begging the question. He's not calling it "Asiancoin" (or anything as offensive as "whitey"). If you're an American working for an American mining company, he'd call it "Americoin".

Isn't the presumption of innocence part of any legal system? The prosecution may have suspected planted evidence too.

I'm calling it a bubble and I've been holding for years. Bubbles happen, I just won't pretend to know how much higher it will go or if it will crash below where it is now.

Other applications care more about location

What about
* A hard fork within 3 months is unsafely fast. They aren't even supporting BIP148 to activate _their own code_ because they're so conservative. There is no consensus for 2MB base block size.
* There's no scientific reason to schedule more block size before we see the actual impact of segwit.
* This would set a precedent of miners directing technical decisions, which would make the project much less interesting to already-millionaire developers. What makes them tick is a desire to change the world, not just to write code for whichever chain is biggest, or to make more money. They would want to fix the thing that broke.
* If users were already running Core, and were _forced_ to hard fork due to a near-universal mining "strike", then they'd just PoW fork. Bitcoin users don't like being told what to do.

Mining is a big weakness in this regard. Right now economies of scale are helping big farms more than thermodynamics are hurting them, and ASICs haven't hit the same limits as CPUs yet.

I guess, but I still think decentralized prediction markets are going to be huge. Humanity has a lot of big coordination problems, that for one reason or another are being held back. We could fight back against the polluters who bribe politicians for low-cost defense. We could bet on cures being released to the public without having to worry about murderous patent trolls. We could shine a light on all the bullshit and lies, replacing them with a clear path forward.

We'll see the true power of bitcoin if they get hacked and lose it.

Every developer, everyone working at Circle, everyone who holds more Bitcoin than he does, everyone who doesn't actively promote contentious hard forks, everyone who holds zero patents.

The same thing that happens when they do that with gold; an investigation.
