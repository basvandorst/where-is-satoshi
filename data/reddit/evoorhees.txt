In that case, some customer orders would never get to the customers. It would be discovered very quickly and stopped/fixed. A customer order while in process is technically at risk (just as someone could swipe your cash while paying cashier at the store), but there are no lingering balances to take, unlike every other exchange. Risk is thus an order of magnitude or two smaller, and could always be paid out of pocket pretty easily.

Percentages are the relevant metric here.
Two assets, one moving avg of 5% per day and one moving 2% per day, it doens't matter what the numerical price of the assets is, the former is more volatile.

@_date: 2016-04-25 19:40:41
I'll address Emin Gün Sirer's points (1 through 11, corresponding with his "flags"):
1. According to Rovion, Bob didn't reach out to him. He (Rovion) reached out to Bob after learning of the March theft. Rovion claimed they communicated primarily by email, and we provided the email he gave me in the report (m0money  So Red Flag  is resolved.
2. "Why on earth would Bob run a criminal business under his real name?"  This is a great question. First, "Bob" isn't his legal name, but is a common name he uses IRL. I don't know if the hacker Rovion knows Bob's legal name, but we do. Still the point stands: Bob was re-using his common pseudonym both in legitimate and criminal matters (working for ShapeShift, and stealing/selling secrets). Here's a fun tidbit we haven't publicized yet... Bob had a seller's profile on a certain darknet market (Nucleus) and comments there stopped right after March 14th (the day of the first hack). It was easy for us to find. The answer to Red Flag  is: yes Bob is basically that stupid. 
3. Red Flag 3 is a good question. My theory is that Bob was on the run after, and knew all eyes were on him. He had already failed once to steal without being caught, and probably felt stealing again would further seal his fate, so he thought he'd sell the valuable info online and nobody would know it came from him. Is that a stupid thing for him to assume? Yeah. I don't know how else to explain it.
4. Red Flag 4... Emin thinks the price paid was not enough. There of course is no guarantee that Rovion told us the accurate amount, but paying someone $20k for information which may, or may not, be valuable tomorrow seems like a reasonable price.
5. Not quite sure what Emin means regarding Red Flag 5. My guess is that Rovion had some kind of assurance that the info was valid, maybe he was able to test it? 
6. Maybe Emin didn't read the report very well. Rovion didn't get "just 2 BTC" for the info he provided. My first chat with him, I paid 2 BTC and got some very vague info. The second chat, Rovion came to me, because he wanted to exchange his ETH for BTC, since his ETH was getting frozen at exchanges. This exchange was likely quite valuable for Rovion (worth far more than 2 BTC), and it was for this exchange that we got the bulk of the valuable specifics. I also think Emin is just being snarky as opposed to factually analytical, saying "And that mark seems all too willing to believe any offered explanation, no matter the source."  &lt;-- Where does that come from? We have been skeptical of all leads and information. We believe Rovion's story (much of it, at least), because it fits the facts that we ourselves uncovered in our investigation. Obviously we took everything told to us by a thief with grain of salt.
7. Remember that Bob was our sysadmin. He didn't think we'd catch him when he stole funds on March 14th. We had help from some resources which he was not aware of, and his plan went to hell. The backdoor definitely indicates malicious forethought, but Bob also seems to be an idiot. Even after getting caught redhanded and being given an opportunity to return the property and walk away, he decided instead to dig his hole deeper.
8. "Voorhees et al. spend their time in between hacks tracking down whether Bob is white."  Nonsense. Emin is grasping for snarky readership here; I thought a Cornell professor would have more grace.  The investigator showed us a police report on Bob, and that report mentioned he was white. We didn't "spend our time tracking it down" as Emin pretends for narrative effect. 
9. Orange Flag  - Emin is right that we (management) failed to notice Bob's incompetence earlier. We have no excuse for that; other than being busy with a million things.
10. More snarkiness from Emin. Yes we should've uncovered that earlier. 
11. And yet more snarkiness from Emin. I offered one "protip" in my report, and I did so because it has helped me in the past, and it may help others. The natural response when dealing with a hacker is to be angry, threatening, etc. That, in my experience, doesn't help. 
Now, none of this means that the "complete story is known." Indeed, there are details we'd still like to know. We don't claim to understand every important aspect. But, the above should address Emin's points sufficiently. 
If Emin is concerned with factual accuracy and investigative journalism, he's welcome to contact me directly (skype: evoorhees) or Michael Perklin at Ledger Labs (our security auditor who prepared the technical post mortem).

It was $15,000 raised. It was spent on development, but we shut down the service as it didn't appear viable. Even though nobody is owned money when a venture fails, I would happily refund everyone the value of their investment, as a nice gesture, but the list of investors was lost by the investment platform (GLBSE). So... what exactly am I supposed to do? I'm open to suggestions.
@_date: 2016-04-19 18:21:10
We did not make a habit of making sure computers were always closed and locked on bathroom runs, etc. Obviously, a mistake. In the long narrative, you'll see Bob says to the hacker he got one of the SSH keys from "an open laptop."

Ethics like don't harm other people who haven't done anything wrong. Don't lie. Don't steal. Don't defraud. I don't get my ethics from government, if I did, I would've supported slavery in 1850. 
Would you have followed the "return runaway slaves to their owners" law if the SEC or similar department had told you to?
The Securities Act, to the extent it deals with fraud, should absolutely apply to me... the vast majority of it, however, that deals with arbitrary rules set by unelected bureaucrats under corrupt conditions... no, those shouldn't apply to anyone.

You're just making that up, no evidence that that was the only way they communicated.


Again, no evidence that happened.


Thanks for the helpful information. I wonder if you've discovered any of the flaws in "the professor's" article or if you're only directing your haughty self-righteousness my way?


Maybe you don't know what "exchange" means? We traded, at market rate, ETH for BTC.


Sounds like everything we do "rubs you the wrong way." Why mention the race issue? Because that was Bob's primary defense/retort/accusation when we confronted him with the evidence, and I wanted to document that as a fact of the case. When a police report later showed he was actually white, I found it humorous and mildly interesting given Bob's fascination with the race issue, and so I added it to the story. By "clearly spent some time on the issue"... from where do you get that impression? I think you and the professor are spending time on that issue, and I'm not sure why.


Why is the story cockamamie? I'm not "believing and repeating" anything. I've been living through it for the past month so I decided to write it up and convey it to the community, both because it was interesting, and because it might help others. 


Hmmm did you actually read his article? It was light on anything technical, and heavy on snarky rhetorical language more befitting of a Buzzfeed contributor than a university professor. If he actually has any technical contributions to make, I've welcomed him to talk directly with me or Michael Perklin of Ledger Labs. He has not once reached out to clarify or discuss any detail. 


I appreciate the sage advice.

The delay is to ensure that we, ourselves, are not scammed. If there is no outcome in which customers can lose money, then I think saying "zero risk" is appropriate. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 22:31:58
Customers don't have accounts or balances with ShapeShift. Instead, like a vending machine, users can initiate single exchanges of one blockchain asset for another. The user selects which asset she wants, and then sends payment. This process takes 0-20 minutes, depending usually on the first block confirmation. The moment the payment is confirmed, the user's asset is sent to her. So, when the site goes down, any orders that were in process are cancelled, and we manually need to send the payments back to those users.  The difference is that ShapeShift at any given time may have a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars of payments in process, which are easy to refund under any circumstance, as opposed to holding millions or tens of millions of dollars in customer account balances like a traditional exchange. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:22:12

When witch-hunting, please provide evidence to make the accusations more interesting. SatoshiDICE volumes were never faked. SDICE shares were not pumped and dumped, they ended their listing more valuable than when they started, and prices rose and fell as all shares of businesses do upon actual business growth and dividend payments. There are not "controversies around feedzebirds."  I raised about $15k in 2011 for that project, and it failed. Lots of stuff fails.

Because the “lower fees” with SegWit would still be higher than the fees a few months prior without SegWit.
Pre SegWit activation, we (ShapeShift) were paying about $3-10 per tx. Post SegWit integration, due to further congestion on the network, we now pay $10-$40 per tx. It’s so bad now that we have a warning message on our homepage warning of the current fees and recommending users don’t do orders less than $250 (sorry entire developing world, Bitcoin is no longer useful for you). Fees would be even higher without SegWit, of course, but the above reality is not exactly something we can “use in our marketing.”

You mean I didn't ask for your permission to use the blockchain for gambling. Please point me to the list of permissible uses. Every transaction had the appropriate fee for miners, and the service was one of a few popular products in Bitcoin's early days that helped it get off the ground. 


You mean SatoshiDICE, which returned over 18% in 9 months to investors in BTC terms (much higher in USD terms). That's not a "pump", that's called making a revenue generating business.


This project failed. Not sure why you say failure of a project is "shady." 


You can't launder money with ShapeShift, we are the most transparent of all exchanges, publishing each transaction on our homepage. Show me a bank that does that.

"B2X coin" is not a thing. 
Perhaps you're referring to the SegWit2x proposal to upgrade Bitcoin with SegWit and a larger block, which succeeded in enabling SegWit in August, but failed to achieve subsequent consensus for a 2MB base block, so was called off.

I like "digital assets".  The reason I've moved away from "cryptocurrencies" is that a) "crypto" is a scary word to some people and b) not all off these coins will be currencies.

I want users deciding what services to use. Not the mods of bitcoin.org. CoinBase is the most popular Bitcoin wallet on the planet, and despite its problems it has considerable virtues... that is why so many people use it. To block them from the list of wallet removes the choice from the user - it means you are deciding for them that they should use better security over better UX, and that shouldn't be your choice to make.

The problem with this theory is, even if you know your fiat currency will devalue a few percent, why would you choose instead to buy a digital currency likely to fluctuate by 10-50%?  Of course, I think any Chinese buying Bitcoin is smart (so long as they understand the technology), but I can't imagine they're doing it explicitly because of minor devaluations in their native fiat.

A million coins would never be "dumped" on the market by someone who was profit-maximizing. They'd be sold over a period of time. Doing so would certainly put heavy downward pressure on price, but it would be a temporary affliction, and could only happen once.

If a good person believes an action to be wrong, it is generally not wise to resort to that same action. Let's lead by example. If censorship is wrong, let's blast CoinBase for it. But censoring CoinBase from new users who generally find it one of, if not the, best wallet experiences is not okay. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:02:40

The solution is not to punish people by putting them in jail (though that's likely deserved in some cases).

A number of people use it as a derogatory term against everything non-bitcoin. The implication being that everything else is a scam.

Advocating against defining it as one or the other doens't mean we shouldn't understand those concepts, and understand that some bitcoin payments will be more secure, or more efficient, than others.

We take custody like McDonald's takes custody when they take your cash and give you a burger. 
The term "custodial" is not appropriate to ShapeShift. Custodial firms hold customer money for some length of time (like a normal exchange that you deposit funds into or a wallet). ShapeShift does not operate in that manner, it processes one customer order at a time. Calling that "custodial" is silly, just as it'd be silly to call McDonald's a custodian of customer money.

I think this ^ is not widely known or appreciated. Most of the pro-blocksize increase people have the belief (correct or incorrect) that Core devs are opposed to blocksize increases.  I think if Core laid out a roadmap SPECIFICALLY for blocksize increases, that would hugely reduce the tension in the room. That roadmap doesn't need dates, specifically, but at least general criterial.  Something like, "Core intends to increase blocksize to 4MB when X, Y, and Z have been accomplished. Then the community can see that it will likely happen, and steps are being taken to get there.

eragmus - thanks for the post, well worded and helpful. The roadmap is good, but it seems that many people don't believe the capacity bump from SW is sufficient, because even with its maximum "2MB" effective blocksize, we'll all just be having the same discussion all year and urgency will once again be upon us in 12 months. SW seems like a fantastic augmentation to scalability, but not sufficient in and of itself. 
Perhaps a straight answer would be helpful from Core: is that roadmap final? And if so, is it correct that no blocksize increase will be implemented or even considered in 2016?  
If that's the case, then it would help move the debate forward, because the community would know that no amount of discussion on block sizes was relevant any time soon, and people could act accordingly (whether that means settling down, or alternatively forcing a hard fork via miners, etc).
So, can you answer that question?

Yes, they have the right to make the call, they own the site. That's not what this is about. The decision is foolish, so I'm speaking out against it. That wallet page is meant to help new Bitcoiners learn about and try out Bitcoin. Removing the world's most popular Bitcoin wallet from that list, and thereby removing a really good onramp for new users, is nuts. It is a petty attack against CoinBase by people who don't like their policies, and prefer to censor rather than debate or inform.

And I commented that: "In other words, transactions from an RBF-enabled wallet will always require 1 confirmation, because the risk of double-spend goes from “possible” to “almost certain.” If the majority of wallets and miners adopt this RBF policy, zero-conf may go away."

We (ShapeShift) utilize BlockCypher's system, combined with some of our own custom zero-conf code, and have been very happy with it.  Many BTC -&gt; Alt transactions happen at zero-conf on ShapeShift, and by early next week LTC -&gt; Alt and Doge -&gt; Alt will do so as well.  BlockCypher is a great company - they've been very responsive and collaborative in our discussions.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:55:05
Why is ShapeShift a "broker"?  It doens't touch money or securities, and doesn't hold client funds. The order of one coin for another is carried out directly from customer to ShapeShift, exactly like McDonalds selling a hamburger. The only difference is that instead of dollars for payment it is cryptocoin1 and instead of hamburger it is cryptocoin 2.

Coinbase + Lawnmower is a great way to casually acquire Bitcoin without having to think about it. If you accumulate a significant dollar value, then consider withdrawing from CoinBase and put it in some form of cold storage or hardware device.

There is no internal market. Customer gives us payment, we send him the product he wanted. It is not any more complicated then that. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:54:38
It's a reasonable question. The answer is twofold: 1) I came to realize that to the extent any digital asset (and I avoid the term cryptocurrency here intentionally) did something economically useful, it would warrant a value/price and 2) I realized it was unecessarily difficult and unsafe to trade such assets with old school custodial order book exhanges. 
On 1) I realized not all coins were exact clones of Bitcoin. Some were significantly different (and I don't mean just a "faster block time"). Some were fundamentally different and would thus likely find unique use cases. Therefore there would be a universe of assets, and they deserved frictionless exchange.  On 2) I discovered an elegant way to enable users to trade coins, with no custody and no accounts. Faster and easier and safer.... thus a business opportunity. And to be able to do it without banks and fiat entirely? And to nurture both the transparency of Bitcoin (all of our txs are visible on homepage) and the privacy which is a right of all humans (no accounts or personal info required)...  Match made in heaven. 
So did I change my mind on alts? Yes. That doesn't mean they are all valid, indeed most are at best experiments and at worst half assed attempts for pump and dumps. Some are valuable though, and beneficial to this industry we are building. They should be judged individually on their merits. I cringe when I hear people refer to the whole body of them as scamcoins. It's lazy bigotry, and often perpetrated by those who aren't confident deep down about Bitcoin itself, which isn't an affliction from which I suffer.
And do I hope to make tons of profits by building a business on these observations? Hells yes.

Well all that's needed is one case for the statement to be true. Of course Bitcoin will be used to fund terrorism. Every currency is used to fund terrorism.

I have some fiat and I have some Bitcoin. I spend both, depending on a number of variables. So... I just disproved your thesis that "people will always spend devaluing fiat currency in preference to Bitcoin."  
And in fact, throughout the industry, when price bubbles happen, Bitcoin spending skyrockets, contrary to the deflation monster argument. 
And to be technically correct, Bitcoin is not deflationary, it is inflationary. Currently it's inflating at around 10% per year, and that rate halves every four years, but never goes negative. A good way to say it is that Bitcoin is inflationary, and the inflation rate tends toward zero.

That statistic isn't very useful. It would only be true if the only coins sold daily were mined coins and if all mined coins were sold every day. Neither is true.

Almost all altcoins have rallied vs. Bitcoin over the past couple weeks.

When I say "potentially all of them" what I mean is "*potentially* all of them." It's a comment on the theoretical upper bound, not the expected real life outcome. 


Men with guns ;)  But seriously, the answer for any BTC company to that question is "time and resources." Payment channels may work great, and be superior, so let's have 'em. But that doesn't mean it's wise to destroy an already working feature that requires less time and resources to implement. Why have Toyota when Ferrari exists? Well... time and resources. The auto industry is healthier when both exist to fit different use cases. 


Well I can, but I didn't. I simply suggested that zero-conf is a valuable feature. 


Correct, nobody said that. Natural rights have nothing to do with this discussion. 


That's another strawman. I know all hypothetical use cases cannot happen on the blockchain. That's fine. That doesn't mean we should eagerly remove features that can happen on the blockchain, and that we've already had and which have proven valuable.

It's not correct that "less than 10 people control the majority."  The majority of hashrate is controlled by individuals, who run in pools.

Sure, but with product's like 21's bitcoin computer, and BitFury's announcement that they'll be selling their new 16nm chips to customers around the world, there are forces for decentralization as well. It's worth keeping an eye on, but probably not worth being overly concerned right now.

The uses are nuanced, the efficiency is nuanced, and the security is nuanced.  Is a 1-conf transaction secure? Well, pretty much, but not totally. How about a 0-conf? Well often not, except maybe depending on one's risk appetite, the size of the tx, indicator variables, etc. These things are what I mean by nuanced, and they often get dropped or forgotten when we think of Bitcoin as either-or, a settlement system or a payment system.

This exact thing happening in summer/fall of 2011. The hashrate fell considerably for several months from its peak. Hashrate always follows price, so if price falls, expect hashrate to fall (sooner or later), but there is no need to worry, because an equilibrium is always found.

The BitLicense will prohibit bitcoin transactions that aren't properly licensed. A website that accepts and holds a bitcoin transaction from a user in New York would be required to be licensed. To the extent Bitcoin is speech (it is just information being shared electronically), this means speech in New York now requires a license. Or in other words, Americans enjoy the freedom of speech only in those cases where a license is not required for a specific kind of speech.

As someone who often writes open letters, let me provide a brief defense of them.  Often the value in a discussion between two people is not that one side will change his/her mind, but that those observing the discussion can gain insights and make their own conclusions. 
Perhaps a good rule of thumb is that an open letter should be for the benefit of the public, not for the personal detriment of the recipient. 
And indeed, I think a world with a few more open letters and long-form editorials, and a few less memes and one-line snark attacks, would be a better world.

Money's value is not rooted in "beliefs."  It is rooted in barter; the natural result of traders seeking out items that others want.  Those items most commonly desired, while also being durable, divisible, portable, and relatively scarce, tend to become "money."
It's not magic or faith or "collective delusion." It is not an abstract concept. Money is just the name we give to the most commonly bartered-for good.

There is no holding company. Buy Bitcoins and keep them stored in a private key. Bury this key in the ground somewhere. If Bitcoin still exists in 20 years, your funds will be safe. And if Bitcoin still exists, it'll be worth vastly more than today (or if it all collapsed it'll be worth zero ;)

Bitcoin.org is intended to help people learn about and start using Bitcoin. CoinBase is arguably the best platform for people to do so (with all the normal caveats that it's custodial, etc). The fundamental question here is not about "giving CoinBase free advertising"... it is about how to best bring new people into Bitcoin. A great way to do that is to show them the most popular wallets and services, and CoinBase is absolutely that. Removing CoinBase is not done in the interest of users (what user really wants that kind of obnoxious paternalism?), it is done as a petty attack by people who disagree with CoinBase's decision to further XT as one of many scaling options. 
Keep users out of this ridiculous infighting. If you don't like CoinBase, argue eloquently against them. Resorting to censorship is the tactic of the coward.

Bitcoin is not deflationary. It is inflationary because Bitcoins are being created (inflation means that the money supply is increasing). The inflation rate falls over time toward zero, but is always inflationary.
Now, many people CALL Bitcoin deflationary because it appreciates in price relative to goods. This is a misuse of the term deflation, but the argument is that because of this, people won't spend and will only "hoard" (aka save money).
This "deflationary spiral" argument is a fallacy for a number of reasons. But most simply, it is because this "problem" is self-correcting. If nobody spends, and only hoards, then the price will go up.... forever? Of course it won't go up forever, it'll correct at some point, and then the reason for "hoarding" goes away (because now the price is falling). Thus an equilibrium will be achieved no matter what.
Popular economists tout the deflationary spiral as a problem because they want to provide academic justification for printing money. It's that simple.

“The issue I have with Bitcoin is that it’s not about the technology, it’s about governments. When people form nations, one of the first things they do is form a currency. Are regulators and governments really going to foster Bitcoin over a long period of time? I think the answer is no.”
Actually, Jamie, America didn't create its fiat US dollar currency until 1971... about 200 years after the nation was formed. Real money doesn't come from government, it comes from the marketplace. That it is often co-opted, manipulated, corrupted, stolen, and centrally regulated by government is the poison for which Bitcoin is the antidote.

@_date: 2014-03-03 21:29:20
Lots of hate in the comments. Let me address with a couple points:
1) This was a tweet. Don't expect the most thorough economic analysis in 140 characters.
2) Yes I'm cherry-picking data. BTC fell significantly from Gox's issues, and a one day price rise doesn't mean Bitcoin is godlike or that it is truly "antifragile."
So feel free to dismiss the tweet if you want to poo poo Bitcoin further.
And yet consider this: MtGox used to be 90% of Bitcoin's trade volume just a year or two ago. It just collapsed and lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Yet Bitcoin only fell in price back to where it was a few months ago. To any objective observer, that should astound.
Comparatively, we see markets all over the world wipe out tens of billions of dollars in value, due primarily to "uncertainty" over a regional political spat in Ukraine. The Russian stock market dropped 10% today. That is significant volatility, considering how big of a market is involved. 
My point is two-fold: Bitcoin is exhibiting amazing resilience, and the legacy financial world, which everyone trusts implicitly, has worrisome vulnerabilities. 
I'll make a prediction. In six months, Bitcoin will have regained all the value lost in its exchange rate from this Gox debacle, and yet numerous global markets, specifically Russia and Ukraine, will not have recovered from whatever is happening there. 
I think the thesis of my tweet - that the world is more exposed to Ukraine than Bitcoin is to MtGox - holds true, and I expect this to be demonstrated handily over the coming months. Considering how large Gox was relative to Bitcoin (massive), vs. how large Ukraine/Russia are relative to global markets (very small), the delta in effect caused by Gox vs. Ukraine is revealing.
The cynics don't need to hand Bitcoin the gold medal upon this observation, but they should at least take note of it.
I think it's not unreasonable to suggest that the government fiat and banking system people implicitly trust, and the distributed cryptocurrency people explicitly denounce, are in the process of teaching a very important lesson.

No not really. Pegging means that an asset is obligated to be traded for another asset at a fixed, known amount. There is no peg between USD and anything in the economy. It's a floating asset, and its exchange rate with any given good varies day to day. This is the opposite "pegging."

To his main point, that Bitcoin will fail because mining will centralize:
1) He confuses risk with destiny. The fact that mining becoming too centralized may happen and may be a risk does not mean Bitcoin will fail. Bitcoin faces many risks that might destroy it (again, as do most assets).
2) He ignores that while pools have become huge, they are made of thousands of participants. They are more like consortiums of individuals rather than monolithic all-powerful entities.
3) He mischaracterizes the motivations of big miners. They are not motivated by "bitcoin idealism." They are motivated by profit, and they have a built in disincentive to screw with Bitcoin because doing so (even the appearance of doing so) could harm or destroy their profits.
4) He fundamentally misunderstands decentralization. Decentralization doesn't mean that mining power is "perfectly decentralized to everyone." It means there is no single institution with monopoly control. It may well be that mining centralizes to some degree, but doesn't mean the structure of decentralization is dead. There is a difference between market-based centralization and coerced institutional centralization. Bitcoin was created as an antidote to the latter, and voluntary market-based mining centralization doesn't impede that raison d'etre.
5) He ignores the innovation of the market... if Bitcoin fails, other cryptocurrency will rise, improved upon the prior. He seems to mistakes the potential failure of one product for the failure of the idea itself.

You don't move to another country. You block the jurisdictions that are problematic. Most of the regulations don't care where you live or where the business operates, but rather where the customers of that business are.

I don't think "money laundering" is a legitimate crime. The bank was just banking, and I don't think the bankers should be jailed for that. I think the "authorities" should fight the real criminals, like the violent cartels. But, if money laundering is going to be a crime, it's absurdly hypocryptical for HSBC execs to have not a single criminal charge brought against them while Charlie is imprisoned for two years. Most people will disagree with me about whether money laundering should be a crime, but even those who think it should be cannot defend this hypocrisy.

Bitcoin was about to go from $5 up to $31, and then crash to $18, and then slowly fizzle out to $2 over the next six months. Throughout this fall, the world declared Bitcoin dead. The trolls came out to party. And lots of early Bitcoiners threw in the towel. Those of us who remained were called "retarded bagholders" and "naive kids who knew nothing about finance or money."

I generally agree with you... much of how some wealthy people become wealthy is through fraud or market distortions of the State. That is a problem and should be corrected. BUT, that is a separate issue than what these "wealth distribution" statistics are discussing. People aren't outraged at the method by which some are becoming wealthy (though they should be)... rather they're simply outraged that some people are so wealthy. This is petty jealousy and misunderstanding of economics, and distracts from the more important issue of state coercion in markets.

This discussion is talking finance exclusively, so the financial concept of a peg is the reasonable one to use. The US dollar is not "pegged" to anything - not to any asset, nor to such as nebulous thing as "GDP." 
The distinction is important, because the author of the NASDAQ article was condemning Bitcoin, claiming it has no value because it was not "pegged" to anything. This is a foolish statement, and betrays an all-to-common misunderstanding of how money works, and from where it gets its value.

I haven't been at Coinapult since February, but to my understanding, The Bit Drop has been shelved primarily due to the government officials on Dominica going silent and becoming unresponsive after the project was announced.

TL;DR - officials in Dominica were all talk and no walk.  can comment further perhaps.

Why do people always assume that if some rich guy owns Bitcoin and invests in the industry, then his pro-Bitcoin stance can't be counted because he's clearly biased?
Perhaps, just perhaps, it was the pro-Bitcoin stance that led the rich guy to invest in the first place. And perhaps the fact that he's rich is an indicator (though not proof) that he knows what he's talking about, and perhaps instead of dismissing his comments without thought, one should consider them for a moment, and judge their merit with a little humility and objective reasoning?

Banks aren't the fundamental problem (as much as we love to hate on them). The fundamental problem is central banking (ie - state-managed money) and the coercive regulatory apparatus built up around the banks. Bitcoin transcends central banking, and whether private banks exist in a Bitcoin future is up to their ingenuity. It's important to know who the enemy is, and it's not a dude who makes a company that holds deposits and provides loans for people.

This concept needs to be highlighted and mentioned frequently in the discourse: The regulation (currently existing and proposed) in the US is not just a matter of additional costs and burden for business. It is a matter of ethical behavior, consumer protection, and the rule of law. One cannot advocate consumer protection, individual privacy, and the 4th Amendment, and simultaneously spy on and report information about users who are not even accused of a crime.  A regulation that mandates the extraction and databasing of private user information is in violation of the Constitution, and more importantly is in violation of ethical behavior. This is the philosophical fight Bitcoin is now forcing.

Bitcoin didn't "solve" the problem, it demonstrated that it was never a problem in the first place.  And there has been enough evidence to at least disprove the worries surrounding the deflationary spiral. The sample size is not 10 people and a thousand dollars of value moving around. Bitcoin is widely used by at least several hundred thousand people (and maybe a few million), has been around for several years, and gone through several bubbles, with billions of dollars of value transferred. The spending pattern is not ambiguous when the price is rising - people spend more, lots more.

Actually, whether online gambling is legal federally is debatable. There is basically a law against using the banking system to pay online gambling sites, but not a clear law declaring online gambling to be illegal. The poker sites got shut down years ago based on the former (they used the banking system).  A few individual states do explicitly ban online gambling, and the federal government can act on behalf of a state if it wants to.

It doesn't support the critics' argument concerning deflation. They argue that people "won't spend" and this will cause a spiral that leads to system failure. It's bullshit. Being more careful about what one spends money on =/= inevitable failure of Bitcoin.

You are saying state's don't use currency debasement to fund war? You are saying that is not reality? America was founded on the practice! 
"Continental Bank Note-
This 1776 note is typical of the paper money issued by the Continental Congress to pay for the costs of the American Revolution. Due to over-issue and lack of confidence in the government, the notes were soon nearly worthless-"not worth a continental." Eventually, Congress redeemed them at 1/100th of their original value in bonds, which did not mature until 1811."

How many times does this need to be explained...
If they "let it out" for free then no publisher in the world picks it up. Then it never gets into traditional distribution channels. It won't end up on television. It won't end up on Netflix. It won't end up on Amazon Prime, etc.
Once you've given it away for free, publishers walk out the door. 
That doesn't mean it couldn't still be a success just based on viral marketing and voluntary donations, but that isn't the route these guys chose to take, because, again, they want to get it in the hands of mainstream individuals who have only heard of Bitcoin from sensational headlines, and most of whom think Bitcoin went bankrupt back when Gox collapsed. Those people get their content through traditional channels, like it or not.
Distribution through the sharing model can be a great thing, and works very well in some cases for some things. That doesn't mean it can or should be the only way content gets made and distributed.

There are two important differences.
1) Bitcoin cannot be debased/printed. It has a fixed supply that no man or woman can change.

Sorry, disagree. You can't just say things have value "because people believe they do," because that begs the question, why do they believe in that particular thing over something else? Value is not arbitrary and is not based on "belief" or "faith." Things have value due to their utility - their usefulness. True of bitcoin, gold, dollars, and pizza. All these things are useful, and scarce, and thus are valuable and command a price in the marketplace.

"Fees" in the bitcoin world are not a problem. They are the incentive which encourages companies to build bitcoin infrastructure. As the system matures, fees will tend toward zero where they can. Those places where they cannot will typically result from inefficiencies in the legacy banking system (exchange fees, etc).  
Using Bitcoin is damn near free. Using Bitcoin + traditional banking system costs money, not because of Bitcoin per se, but because of the banking system.

Increase in monetary base IS inflation. This inflation can then cause prices to increase, which needs a different name. I understand that most Econ 101 textbooks would disagree with me. They are wrong about this and a host of other things. 
Money supply increase = inflation.
Prices going up =/= inflation (though popular culture, and econ 101 textbooks thinks it is).

That's not correct. First of all, banks in Panama are regulated in Panama. You think the US Gov is the only entity capable of writing things on paper and throwing you in jail if you don't comply?  Regardless of that, a rural Kenyan farmer using Coinapult + Locks to hold his wealth is not in the same position as someone with USD in Bank of America. Why not? Because to have USD in Bank of America, you need the permission of Bank of America to have an account. You also need to surrender your identity to do so. And unless you're an American or a resident, it ain't happening. Coinapult let's people interact economically anywhere in the world with nobody's permission, and Locks let's them do this without suffering volatility.

It helps Bitcoin because it makes it fundamentally more useful as a payment network. There is arguably a short term negative (depression in price) but a long term positive (bigger network of merchants).  Consider this thought experiment: if EVERY merchant on earth suddenly accepted Bitcoin, but also converted immediately to USD, would that be positive or negative? It would be immensely positive... Bitcoin would've won, and an equilibrium price will be arrived at over time, where demand and supply balance.

It's wise not to lump all altcoins into one group. Most altcoins are stupid/useless. Some, however do interesting things, and some do quite valuable things.  Nubits/Tether/BitUSD all track the value of the US dollar - that is something Bitcoin cannot do, and thus they have their complimentary use case. Dash and Monero are far more private than Bitcoin, which is also valuable. Coins like NXT actually have an entire asset exchange built into them, which is very cool and which would not be appropriate to try and stick into Bitcoin's core software.
So in any case where an altcoin does something unique and useful, then it makes sense for it to have value and users. And while this is the minority of altcoins, that doesn't mean the entire altcoin industry should be dismissed.

I think game theory would suggest that colored coin assets wouldn't tend to be valued higher than the security that protects them would justify.  
Assume bitcoin market cap is $100 (thus almost zero hashing/mining power defending it). Then assume a Bitshare is worth $100,000,000. That would be foolish, because there's an economic reason to gain 51% of the Bitcoin mining power. So, only fools would bid Bitshares up to $100,000,000 in that context, and thus it likely wouldn't happen in the first place :)

I think most libertarians who have spent more than 20 minutes looking into Bitcoin are big fans.
The libertarians who are vocally opposed are almost always "gold bugs"... in that they believe gold is the only form of proper money, and because Bitcoin is not gold, it is bad. 
It happens when a libertarian (rightly) understands the flaws of fiat money, and the virtues of gold, and then (wrongly) carries that forward to assume that only gold can be good money. 
And some others are just luddites, and don't understand or appreciate anything that they "can't hold in their hands." The fact that they express this disdain on a computer over the internet is pretty funny... :)

The "deflationary spiral" theory has been proven incorrect by Bitcoin. When Bitcoin price is going through its bubbles, spending goes through the rough. People spend more when they are wealthier. 
I have seen this anecdotally in my own behavior (I spend much more when Bitcoin price is increasing), and it has been attested by the Bitcoin payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase.  People spend money when they have more of it.
The suggestion that "we need steady inflation" (ie - we need steady monetary debasement) is a fallacy. It could be argued about by smart people before, but no longer. Bitcoin answered the question.
EDIT: There also another important argument: the "deflationary spiral" when it comes to Bitcoin would be a self-correcting problem. Suppose rising prices DID cause people not to use Bitcoin... eventually the price would stabilize or fall because of lack of use (the price can't go up forever). And if rising price = less use in that scenario, then falling price would spur use again, thus correcting the problem.  So even if the "deflationary spiral" theory were true (which it's not), it would resolve itself.

People still don't seem to understand that the early allure of SatoshiDICE was demonstrating the power of Bitcoin by not requiring accounts of any kind. That required on-chain txs. Ultimately, the market evolved and most/all dice sites now do things off-chain, but you shouldn't dismiss the value that enabling on-chain, provably-fair gaming brought to Bitcoin in its early days.

I live in Panama. I can verify that banks have been closing the accounts of US citizens for about a year due to anticipation of this law.

This trend is happening around the world, and most people in the US are completely unaware because most Americans don't have a foreign bank account.
Soon, Americans will wake up and realize they've been financially ring-fenced... unable to open accounts outside the country. Their money will thus be trapped.

I do support a blocksize increase. I'd like Core to commit clearly and publicly to following Adam Back's 2-4-8 plan, with the HF happening "reasonably soon", such as in 2016. This position is very close, if not identical to, what Core already seeks, but they've failed to communicate it, and so we have people running around saying "Core never wants scale because they are evil and want to destroy bitcoin because blockstream!" 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:29:26
Correct. North would have a more legitimate argument (though still wrong) if he claimed Bitcoin was just a speculative bubble without merit. He uses the word "ponzi" either to get attention or because he doesn't really understand what it means. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:21:01
SegWit doesn't double potential transactions, but it enables more like 1.5-1.75x, and that's assuming everyone is using it, which takes some time. This capacity increase is good, but don't exaggerate the figures. 
And by "most prolific spammers of the blockchain in history" I assume you're referring to SatoshiDICE. If you think use = spam, then we're not going to have much we agree on. You call it spam, I call it kickstarting an industry... 
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:30:55
Few people think there should be "no limit" to the blocksize. That doesn't preclude the possibility that 2MB or 4MB is more appropriate as an arbitrary cap than 1MB. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:21:00


Thats ridiculous... SatoshiDice didn't preclude anyone from doing anything. It was SD's opponents who were trying to alter people's natural behavior.
Tell me this... CoinBase is responsible for vastly more on-chain transactions today than SatoshiDice ever was. So too is blockchain.info. Are they also spamming? Of course not. They build software than make Bitcoin useful. SatoshiDice not only did that, but did it back when the entire system was in a lull and I spent a year arguing with strangers on the Internet about why Bitcoin was legitimate and valuable and worthy of their time instead of their ridicule. SatoshiDice was one of the first real demonstrations of Bitcoin's power. 
It was over 50% of all txs not because it was spam, but because it was actual use during Bitcoin's childhood.
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:24:12
That's completely irrelevant to the real discussion, and assuming is "one crowd" who is carrying out an alleged attack is assumption built upon further assumption. 
The fact is that transactions are growing, fairly quickly. It is a matter of a few months before blocks are completely full, and volume spikes are already getting there.

There is no such thing as an "MSB License" in the US. MSB's need to register with FinCEN, but that's not a license. The license comes when a business crosses the "MTB" or Money Transmitter Business threshold.

There are already capacity increases on the roadmap, most notably SegWit. This is good. Better still, and importantly, a block increase should be added to this roadmap, especially since it seems Core generally agrees on it happening. The only step remaining, really, is proper and professional communication so that the community is on the same page. If that can be done, I think much of the community will start rallying back around Core and we can all get back to work.

Bitcoin has an ethos, not perfectly shared by everyone, but reasonably universal in the community. Part of that ethos is opposition to censorship. We can debate what constitutes "unreasonable censorship," but I think most people, and importantly most of Core, felt the reddit censorship was wrong. Most people in Core denounced it privately, but not publicly, and the public largely misperceived that as Core endorsing, or even causing, the censorship. This is again a matter of communication. Core made enemies because of its silence, over an issue that wasn't' even contentious, largely. 
I want Core to get the respect and appreciation they deserve... a large part of that is for Core to convey its thoughts clearly. Otherwise, darkness and confusion runs rampant.

The money raised for FeedZeBirds totaled about $15,000 (and yes, it was converted to USD back then because there were costs to build, run, and market the site). The business failed, and GLBSE fell apart, so there was no way to know who the shareholders were. SEC commandeered $15,000 from me... I would've preferred to give that $15k back to the shareholders of FZB (if they could be found, which they can't), but the SEC didn't give me that option, and while I was struggling with the SEC I was advised not to discuss anything publicly, thus the lack of updates, which I apologize for. If anyone would like to start a campaign to get the money back from the SEC, I'd love to signup.  Edit: feel free to read the SEC settlement as well:

Because the mainstream doesn't care about privacy (unfortunately) and for Bitcoin to get big, it needs large "licensed" companies to interface between the crypto world and the traditional fiat world. Coinbase is no better than a bank, except that it is furthering the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Yeah I considered that... I certainly think Bitcoin's volatility is a result of its newness and its relatively small market size, both of which get corrected over time. But, I wanted to address North's argument head on - let's assume Bitcoin is volatile forever. That doesn't make it a Ponzi scheme.

I never said everyone can be happy. You are mischaracterizing my argument. I said competency in social consensus, meaning the ability to gain support from the large majority of the community. This prevents fracturing and red team/blue team bickering which is the current state of affairs. Not everyone needs to be happy, and everyone can disagree about one thing or another, but social cohesion can still be nurtured.

So because where there are high levels of wealth redistribution the citizens tend to be the happiest, you assume the former causes the latter. Why do you make that assumption?  Countries that are mostly white people also tend to have the happiest citizens. Also, countries that are further from the equator also tend to have the happiest citizens. Perhaps government should be set up to redistribute more wealth, reduce the number of non-white people, and move everyone away from the equator?  Because correlation.

Wait a second. It's true that a "bond" is created out of thin air, but that's because it's just an obligation, a contract. You take in money, and then promise to repay it.  But money itself shouldn't be created out of thin air - it is not legitimate for the Fed to create a million dollars out of nothing, then give the US Government a million dollars. It's a trick. And the Fed is not the only one doing it - retail banks do this same trick when they provide a loan. They create the money out of nothing, then are paid back over time, with interest. 
Doing this leads to severe credit bubbles at best, and at worst can destroy a currency with runaway inflation.

Every transaction to SatoshiDICE was sent  by a user who wanted to play the game. Use for gambling is no more or less legitimate than use for any other commercial purpose. Both myself and the user benefited from the transaction, that's why it happened. Tx fees were paid on every one. In fact, during that time, SatoshiDICE was paying more in tx fees to support the network than everyone else combined. 
Any Bitcoin transactions done for legitimate commercial purposes, with appropriate fee paid, is by definition not a spam transaction. You slander it as such to make a weak point and personally attack me instead of addressing the issue. Please try to raise your game a little.

@_date: 2016-03-01 01:13:15
It's not really a matter of affording a few pennies (though that is relevant for lots of small tx use cases), the bigger issue is one of user experience at this stage in Bitcoin's development. The clogging is causing serious strife for new users and casual users... we fight hard to attract people to Bitcoin, and when their first experience is a tx that gets lost in the void for several hours (and they have no idea when it will clear or what that even means), it's like we've lost a user and delayed adoption of Bitcoin. 
Faster adoption isn't everything, but it is important. I worry Core devs discount its importance too heavily. A decentralized system that doesn't get used is not better than a centralized system that does.

Umm okay there are probably a few people that don't like SegWit, maybe. The vast majority of people in the community support it, irrespective of their opinion on block sizes. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:48:48
The community should stand up against shit, I agree completely. Boycotting an entire conference because of one speaker is not the way to do it.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:27:16
Adam - I appreciate that position. However, the ~2MB soft-fork solution, through SegWit, applies even more significantly to a bitcoin with 2MB native blocks. In other words, the good and valuable work of SegWit is made MORE valuable by a 2MB block than by a 1MB block, for SegWit roughly doubles the max tx quantity. 
So, portraying it as an either-or situation isn't correct. It is not the case that "either" SegWit soft-fork 2MB happens, OR hardfork 2MB happens. Both can, and IMO both should happen. Increasingly, it appears both will.
The question is then, how to do it most safely? In an ideal world, Core would realize the vast support for larger blocks (made increasingly apparent by Classic's momentum), and would work to incorporate that 2MB support into Core. Core has stated that absolutely will not happen, however. Fine, that's professional disagreement. But it means a fork will occur without Core's stewardship.
SegWit is a great compliment to blocks of any size, and for that reason, perhaps paradoxically, SegWit will not satiate the demand for 2MB or greater blocks. 
Ultimately, Classic is not about a magic 2MB block size. It is about showing the world that one group of devs doesn't have monopoly power on the protocol. It has become an experiment and lesson in decentralization. Even those who denounce Classic should be able to appreciate that sentiment.

Bro, I use Bitcoin every day as a user and as a business. I am seeing firsthand significant delays on a non trivial number of txs. The sky is not falling yet (and please cut with the hyperbole), but the problem is real and it is growing. The network as a whole is okay, it is resiliant, but individual users are getting strained already. This is not some kind of myth or scare tactic. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:19:46
I'm happy to keep discussing this, but when you venture into personal ad hominem nonsense, it gets difficult.
I did get a partial list of shareholders, emphasis on partial. I tried for months after GLBSE's collapse to get a proper list from GLBSE through multiple sources and didn't succeed. If you know how I can get such a list, please pm me or email me. erikvoorhees at gmail
And please cut with the rhetoric. "Scot free"?  Let's do the math here. I raised $15k with my partner in the project. It gets spent on the business (we spent more than $15k on development... that amount doesn't go far). The business failed. Investors are not entitled to a refund when businesses fail - that's the risk we all take as investors. 
Nevertheless, I made some money with SatoshiDICE and tried to get a list to pay back the FZB investors anyway (even though there was no obligation to do so). But there was no list, other than a spreadsheet with 20 or so investors representing less than 1/4th of the shares. So what can I do, exactly?
Then the SEC comes after me later for SatoshiDICE, and drags FZB into it. I pay many tens of thousands in legal fees just to deal with it, plus $15k is then taken from me personally on top of that.  For the crime of what... not registering the shares?  Does the SEC give that $15k back to the shareholders? Of course not. 
Listen - investments are risky, and most startups fail. I've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in startup investments. It's not because they were scams, it's because they failed. 
Investors in FZB lost $15k. I also lost $15k, plus months of time working on the project, and thousands more on top of that dealing with the SEC. And now I have to deal with a handful of angsty trolls on the internet. 
If you want to criticize me for not be on top of my communication with the shareholders, that is valid criticism. If you want to criticize me for the fact that the business failed, that's fine. But cut the sensationalist accusations, please.

Thanks for the good response.
I was super happy to see the Roundtable Consensus plan, which focuses on the priority SegWit right now, and works toward a HF by summer next year. It's slower than I'd prefer, but it's a good plan and one I could endorse. However, why is this not on the formal Core roadmap yet? There is still lingering concern and question of whether that "consensus" was just a few core devs in HK, or whether it is really the go-forward plan.  Can you comment on this?
I appreciate the mempool statistics image. I understand that congestion isn't an emergency just yet. However, it is going to be an emergency soon (meaning, within 2-6 months). 
SegWit now, plus a conservative HF block increase as early as possible next year is probably adequate, and I feel it's a good compromise between the sides. Can't we get this formally on Core's roadmap and end the ambiguity of communications? Let me know if I can help in any way with this.

Bitcoin is a diverse ecosystem of many kinds of users (and nodes)... engineering it such that every user must be only one kind of node (a full one) will make it brittle and awkward, and preclude any serious level of usage.

Not entirely true. In the US, gambling generally isn't technically illegal federally (though it is illegal in a few states). Using the banking system to fund gambling, however, is prohibited, and this is what brought down the poker sites a few years ago. So there is an argument that gaming with bitcoin is perfectly legal under federal law... it's a grey area, but means of payment and wager may indeed be relevant. Of course, why it could possibly be illegal for "free people in the most free country on earth" to make wagers voluntarily with their own money is beyond me.

Certainly not, nor have I claimed to. But while I understand and respect the talents of the core devs, I worry they may not understand and respect the talents of other stakeholders in the industry. Step 1 in this is all parties being civil with each other. Step 2 is figuring out reasonable compromise, and communicating it effectively to rally support and build consensus. I feel like the industry is close... but it seems to continually need nudging.

Regulations are arbitrary mandates imagined by politicians, which are imposed upon various groups of people. They happen due to the hubris of central planners, and the immoral notion that coercion upon peaceful people is acceptable human behavior. They rarely achieve their objective, and frequently cause unintended consequences and unseen costs upon society. Thousands of pages of them are hoisted upon the world every year, without end.
There never comes a day when central planners take a pause, and say, "we now have enough regulation."

1) Pools don't control mining. Miners can leave whenever they wish. Pools can influence mining, but that =/= control.
2) Saying that "3 dudes control the code" is just false. And again, as I wrote in the piece, we (the users of Bitcoin) only use it to the extent we like what the devs are doing. We can, whenever we wish, leave the Bitcoin protocol, fork it, or start an entirely new coin. That dynamic is the antithesis of centralized, coercive control.

This is a little naive to reality I'm afraid. A Bitgo transaction I made today recommended a fee of 0.003 btc today (yes you read that right). And Bitgo has been one of the leaders in responsive fee calculations. Many wallets don't change fees dynamically, and thus many thousands of new users are getting lost in the void. It is terrible for UX and adoption, and I wish people (even those who advocate small blocks) would appreciate that concern more.

I'm referring to blocksize increase. That is what needs to be on the formal roadmap for this civil war to end. SegWit is almost irrelevant to this point. Right now, roadmap says "segwit now...".  It should say, "segwit now, block increase by Q2 2016" or similar. The benefit this would provide to the community, to have some closure on this issue, is tremendous. A billion dollars of Bitcoin market cap can be gained by more productive and professional communication and planning on the part of Core. There is so much benefit to be gained, and so much risk diminished (ie - vastly lower chance of contentious hard fork) with so little cost.  That it hasn't been done yet confounds me.

It is a matter of diplomacy. Distrust and anger was sown by the censorship, and by Core's lack of standing up against it. Many (incorrectly) ascribe the censorship to Core itself. It is a gesture, and an important and meaningful gesture, to demonstrate the principles on which groups stand. All of us in this industry, regardless of opinion on block sizes, should be opposed to wholesale blockading of perspectives.

The fact that much of the community doesn't even realize this means that Core has failed in its communications.

Getting the community to rally around Core is indeed my goal here, but that's unlikely to happen without all sides leaving their comfort zone a little bit. If Core doesn't follow my suggestions, I won't vilify or dismiss them, and I understand they would make that decision because they think my suggestions are misplaced. That's fine, we can disagree. But in that case, it is hard for me to support them personally, and I think the divisiveness in the community will continue, and the potential for contentious hard fork will not go away.

It's deceptive because the OP was very clear, referring to a block increase. SegWit is not a block increase, and while both SegWit and block increases have some mutual benefits (of scale), intentionally conflating on with the other is deceptive. They are different things, and one ought not be substituted for the other.

Thanks for coming back with meaningful debate and conversation, I'll comment on a few of your points...


Other than perhaps a few angsty individuals, I don't think most Classic supporters want to "cut people out." They widely recognize, respect, and admire the talents and dedication of all or most all of the Core team. 


Here's the thing... people on both sides see the other as being exactly that, "adversarial." Classic folks feel, after months of intense debate (not to mention wanton censorship - which I know is not Core's fault technically but is still associated with their position), that Core is stonewalling the large portion (majority?) of the community who wants larger blocks and wants them now. Similarly, I understand some supporters of Core feel that Classic is "adversarial."  The problem is that the one fundamental point - raising the blocksize - cannot be collaborative between the two sides, because Core has stated repeatedly that no blocksize shall occur any time in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not at all. So that's the end of collaboration. The "Path toward scalability" signed by Core is helpful, but not sufficient to appease the desires of those who want the larger blocks.


The larger block people have tried to "collaborate" for quite a while. There is just good old fundamental disagreement. This is okay, it happens. But the result is a splintering of the community, a likely fork, and the path forward will be decided ultimately by peoples actions once the fork arrives. I see no other way to "bridge the difference" between the sides, if Core is unwilling to raise the blocksize via hardfork at least to 2MB.


Nobody thinks that. More accurately, they think that Core's path is insufficient because it doesn't include even a very moderate blocksize increase, despite significant demand from many miners, businesses, and community members for such a feature. 


I agree 100%. Personally, I know that Core generally doens't support the censorship, but the community at large gets that impression. It would benefit Core *greatly* to come out with a statement denouncing the censorship, and inviting discussion of hardforks and other clients, even if they disagree with them. That would give Core credibility, and help to heal the wounds currently festering. Doesn't mean it'd stop Classic, or the hard fork, from happening, but it'd be a productive step regardless. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:09:32


First, they shouldn't "pretend." They should sincerely consider that a very large portion of the community believes a larger block "reasonably soon" is important. Most of Core, in fact, thinks this also, but they differ on what "reasonably soon" means. That's fine. The community is surely open to Core's opinion on "when is appropriate," but so far it's completely open-ended. This leads many to assume it won't happen, or won't happen any time soon, and the very real concern about block scarcity then compels them to seek alternatives, be it XT or Unlimited or Classic or whatever comes next. This misunderstanding has caused immense damage to the community, and indeed, to Core's own productivity I'm sure.
How can it not be understood that such a great victory (gaining the widespread support of the community) can be had for such a trivial price (mere commitment to "some range" of time that Core feels is workable)? 
People see Core's unwillingness to achieve this victory and can understandably question Core's ability to accurately assess tradeoffs in the first place. 


Nobody ever said it was their job to comment on social networks as a whole. You are intentionally mischaracterizing the argument. Stated correctly, the suggestion to Core, is to acknowledge the severe damage that the censorship caused, and to denounce such censorship. That should be agreeable to the devs both on principle and on pure tactical consideration.

I'll happily tell you my bias since you think using that word affects the validity of my arguments... I want conservatively bigger blocks, I want segwit, and I want the community to heal. Id like to avoid a contentious hard fork and am thankful to Core for the work theyve done, though I think a few key things need to be done differently. Now tell us your bias so we can all be transparent with each other.

Nowhere have I ever endorsed Bitcoin Classic or any hardfork. I am undecided. I am simply getting fed up with the censorship. If people want to criticize Classic or any other idea, fine, I can respect that opinion. When instead of intelligent discussion they merely call it an "altcoin" or censor it entirely, that I cannot respect. 
Before even getting back to the important debate, and I believe all your questions are valid, we MUST stop the censorship. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:34:52


It means Core, as a group, can and should occasionally make statements on behalf of the group. In fact, this is done already quite often. Was not the blog post about SegWit cited in OP not an example of this? 
I do understand and appreciate that Core is not a monolithic entity, however. Individuals within the group have varying opinions (and rightfully so). This shouldn't preclude occasional consensus and communication from Core as a group out to the broader community.

It is really unwise of you to underestimate the portion of the community that thinks larger blocks soon is very important. The sentiment will continue resurging, and each time it does, it causes immense distraction, price depreciation, adoption woes, and bad publicity. And ultimately, the risk of a contentious hard fork could turn into an actual contentious hard fork. The risk is real. And it doesn't help the situation to belittle the other side.

I understand the slippery slope argument. Advocating for 2 or 4mb blocks at this stage in bitcoins development does not mean I also advocate for 50 or 100mb blocks tomorrow. When other good paths to scale are in existance, the need to increase block size will diminish. We are not there today.

Yes! We'd love to have it and use it. We've always been supporters of both SW and technologies like Lightning. We're also supporters of marginally larger blocksizes which makes us unwelcome/vilified here.

I think it's a crucial talking point. Many people are scared of Bitcoin because "it's computer money."

It's good that Core put up that site. But, I have to say, if a communications strategy relies on a github link, it is doing it wrong.

Good post. I think a key takeaway is: Bitcoin blocks can double in size every N months without increasing centralization. We can argue over what N is, but not whether that relationship exists. Good insight. I also agree with the argument that bigger blocks can possibly (though not necessarily) increase node count, since if 10x people are using Bitcoin, it's not unreasonable to expect more nodes, even if it's harder to run a node due to larger block size.

Hmmmm... depends on some specifics. Let's say, hypothetically, Lightning was ready tomorrow, and it indeed offered tremendous scale, and congestion issues went away. I would consider that "problem solved" and would suggest to anyone still advocating bigger blocks that perhaps it's no longer necessary. 
With that said, Lightning is not ready, nor even is SegWit, and in reality transactions are getting very close to an emergency situation. A conservative block size increase can help with this reality right now. It shouldn't be done recklessly, but it should be done with a reasonable plan, timeframe, and commitment. 
Is that fair?

A Bitcoin world will still have overdraft fees (you are essentially borrowing at high interest to pay someone - it's a service which is independent of the form of money used). If no paper money exists, then no atm fees, however.
More important than atm or overdraft fees, however, is that a Bitcoin world will be one without inflation fees. No longer will all of society lose 2-3% of it's wealth (specifically that wealth held as currency) every single year.

This is a difference in definition. "Inflation," properly understood, means an increase in base money supply (not credit). Anything that increases money supply is inflation. Since only the Federal Reserve and Banks can create USD legally, all inflation is caused by them.
The other definition of "price inflation" is important too, but different. All kinds of things cause price inflation (monetary inflation/money printing being only one of them)

I'd like to issue a correction on something I stated in the beginning of the podcast. I said something to the effect of "Core has stated it will not increase the blocksize."  This isn't entirely true, nor entirely false. When I recorded that podcast, it was after a comment I had read on Reddit from a core dev, where I asked him directly "Will you be adding blocksize increase to the roadmap" and he said no. 
At the time, I thought that was representative of Core largely. Today, I do not think it anymore. So, I apologize for making that statement prematurely on the podcast.

Metrics like "worth" and "hashrate" are not arbitrary, they are the market's specifications. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:46:24
Perhaps I can shed some light on this...
Our company (ShapeShift) deals with thousands of bitcoin transactions to and from customers every day. When the mempool fills up, we literally get hundreds of failed or stuck orders as users send BTC to us from all sorts of wallets. An order can fail, for example, when we offer a Precise exchange rate, which guarantees that rate for a window of time (10 mins or so). If that window passes before we've received the BTC, then the order fails... and if the user sent her BTC and it's stuck in the mempool for two days, then we basically have an angry customer to deal with for two days until the BTC confirms and then we can issue a refund. So it's messy. We in turn have to set our own mining fee for the txs we send out. 
When fees are not set "very high" then we risk a large number of these failed or delayed transactions. To improve UX, we generally need to overestimate fees, and because fees are very spiky, we end up usually paying much more in fees than we "need" to, because if we reduce the number and a spike in mempool happens, we now have 50 upset customers.
Thus, whatever you think the "right" fee is at any given time, actual businesses will often have to overestimate, charging people more in fees than they need to, in order to prevent a mess of customer support issues. If the mempool stays empty for a while, we can, with hesitation, lower the fee over time, but there is a lag.

1.  I have been trying to help, and I'm not demanding anything of them. I'm giving recommendations, and have spent many hours as someone sympathetic to all sides of this issue, offering to help wherever I can be useful. You're assuming this post is the only thing I've been up to, and you're assuming it based on zero evidence, just a desire to assume the worst about me. This, coincidentally, is the same kind of unhelpful behavior that many in Classic have perpetrated against Core - assuming the worst about them. 
2. I don't understand why "treating people as adults" is equivalent to leaving morality at the door. That is my morality. I treat adults as adults, I don't pretend to know what's best for them, and I try not to make assumptions about anyone or their motives. I've denounced Garza plenty, but I do it while not trying to censor or block out anyone who disagrees with me, including Garza himself. When Paycoin was a new cryptocurrency, gaining exchange volume, we added it to ShapeShift. Once we felt there had been a material breach of terms, ie fraud, we delisted Paycoin immediately, and spent resources to let people know about the issue. I spent hours in the Paycoin forums and chat rooms explaining to Garza's zealots why we did the action, and hoping to educate them on the seeming scam that was being perpetuated on them. You are confusing my preference to treat adults as adults with a nonchalantness about unethical behavior. I speak out about unethical behavior at every opportunity... the difference between us is that I don't also try to censor the opposing position.

A private lawsuit: a suit between two private parties, one believing itself to be wronged materially by the other. As opposed to government intervention and regulation, in which people who haven't hurt anyone are harmed themselves, stolen from, and impeded from their peaceful, productive, and honest activities. 
Private lawsuits don't need government involvement whatsoever (just as transportation, food, and medical industries don't need government involvement).People who don't understand emergent order and complex systems have a hard time understanding markets generally, and hold, as their eternal solution and salvation, coercive government.

If you really believe that then you are very detached from the conversation. I think the majority of the community desires a larger blocksize. It is a minority of people, but certainl a number of very smart and dedicated people who I respect, who are opposed to the blocksize increase and the hardfork that goes along with it. The majority is not right merely because it is a majority... but I'd sure as hell say it's worthy of debate, and all this censorship nonsense is causing terrible damage because [censored]
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:33:14
We would support that, but the reality is the markeplace isnt accepting it. So we would prefer segwit+2mb hardfork if it would enable segwit to actually pass. 
We dont let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Bitcoin needs to move forward. We would support any plan that helps scale, isnt reckless, and actually has a chance of happening. SegWit alone, as currently proposed, doesnt satisfy the third condition unfortunately.

Fair enough, but that doesn't mean we should continue forever with the arbitrary limit at 1mb instead of 2 or 4 or 8. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:45:47
My position is the following:  If a fork happens (with BU or anything similar in the future), ShapeShift will list it as a new coin (new name, new symbol). This is purely for practical reasons, not a judgement for or against.  If the market decides to follow the BU chain, then after enough time, and with enough clarity on the market's decision (ie - not ambiguous), I would refer to that chain as Bitcoin and ShapeShift may reassign the name/ticker. 
I don't think any group gets to say what is Bitcoin and what it isn't. That definition properly emerges from the consensus of the market (remember, decentralization?). If 90% of hashrate, users, and market value prefer the BU chain, then in my mind that is Bitcoin, and the minority chain is not. Similarly, if Core ever leads a HF with a substantial majority support, I will also consider that Bitcoin. Core supporters should be careful: if you advocate that any HF creates an altcoin, then what will you do when Core proposes one? 
Hardforking from the main chain doesn't create an altcoin. It creates a decision point, on which every market participate must judge for himself. The outcome of those decisions, unpredictable ahead of time, is a more appropriate declaration of the true Bitcoin than any specific group within.  Stated differently, if a majority doesn't get to declare what Bitcoin is, then certainly neither does a minority. It is a choice I'm happy leaving to the market, anything else is the exact kind of centralization that Bitcoin was built to resist. 
None of the above position endorses BU. Indeed, as I've stated in many places, I do not support BU. But I do support decentralization, and I respect long-term market-based decisions, and if the market clearly prefers the new chain, then I will respect that. 
This explicitly does NOT mean that if on day 1 after a HF, the BU chain has 60% of hashrate, I am not suddenly going to claim that to be the true Bitcoin. I'm going to let the market make it clear, which will take time and multiple metrics, and leave it at that.

Not at all. Everyone has different interests. I mean cultivating a culture where differences are discussed with civility. People shouldn't feel like opponents. Right now, they do. We have team red and team blue, and individuals have become more interested in lobbing barbs at the other team than in empathizing and respecting each other. We don't need kumbaya, but we do need professional discourse. Both sides have been guilty of diminishing the possibility of professional discourse. Maybe it's just endemic to communication on the internet, but I think we can do better. We are not each others' enemies.


You're just dismissing team blue. Those who support "bigger blocks soon" are more than a "couple of trolls." Not trying to belittle, vilify, or diminish people who have opposing views is a good first step to nurturing social consensus. And again, I'm not picking on Core. I respect them and want them to succeed. Success means more than just writing useful code, in a project such as this. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:16:07
IMHO, Core has indeed lost the trust and goodwill of much of the community. Is that contentious at this point?

It's impossible to say how much capital is needed to push price to $1000 and hold it there. It all depends on how many people sell. If everyone pulled their sell orders off the exchanges, then theoretically $1 of invested money could move the Bitcoin price to $1000.  If people continually sold coins, then it could take billions of dollars to move the price to $1000.

Thanks for engaging in the discussion and being reasonable in your statements.
1) I'm not intending to attack anyone. I can't fathom that my OP could be interpreted as an "attack" on Core. I've spent much of the past two weeks trying to get people to stop attacking Core, and similarly, trying to help Core understand how it can improve to help the community as well. I think "censorship" is an appropriate term for the removal of entire topics of conversation on r/bitcoin. I stated explicitly that this censorship is not properly blamed on Core, but that they should have spoken out against it (if not for principle, then at least for tactical reasons). 
2) Yes, maintainers of bitcoin.org have the legal and moral "right" to remove CoinBase. It was a foolish and counterproductive move, but it was their right. I'm glad Core created BitcoinCore.org to distinguish itself and its positions from bitcoin.org after this incident. Again, I tried to praise Core for this move and others in my OP.  
I'm not aware of Roger Ver censoring r/btc. And he does not have control over bitcointalk, so I'm not sure to what you're referring.
3) My definition of censorship is this: removal of entire topics of conversation which are relevant, though may be contentious, during the course of a debate. Things which are not censorship: removal of spam, fraud, violations of ToS and community guidelines, etc. I realize in some cases there is grey area. I do not believe the wholesale removal of discussion about larger blocks, and specific implementations (such as XT or Classic), can be described as anything other than censorship. It was wrong.
4) I have no idea what your 4) is referring to. I don't think I said anything like that, can you please cite?

I don't think a blog post from myself as Erik Voorhees, denouncing Roger for not adding those links to his sites is appropriate. If it was tearing the community apart, and Roger had refused to change that after months of debate, then maybe I would.


With respect, I must disagree, strongly. The actions of censorship against all discussion of larger blocks, over the past few months, has hugely contributed to the distrust and anger on the part of Core's opponents. It caused serious social damage. Public, well-written refutation of that action is absolutely appropriate, both on practical grounds (to bring back trust where it was lost) and on philosophical grounds (to speak out against bad behavior).

I don't think so. Denouncing the action of someone doesn't mean accepting responsibility for that person's actions.

They should be able to clearly convey that distinction, and the result would be **less** blame upon them for the censorship activities, not more.

@_date: 2016-01-27 00:09:36
Greg, nothing in my post was intended as disrespect. I am sorry if it came across that way to you.
Thank you for denouncing Theymos' censorship. I understand some other individuals in Core did so as well. Please understand my message here is a suggestion on how to win back the hearts and minds of many in the community who you now feel are antagonistic to you.  Core clearly and publicly denouncing that censorship (as opposed to it coming from a couple individuals) removes the argument from your opponents that Core supports the censorship. Take away the ammunition used against you. I think most Core members personally did denounce the censorship, but the communication was not clear to the community. If you don't desire clear communication with the community, then okay, but don't be surprised about continuing confusion and mischaracterization, which we both want to get rid of. 


As politely as I can, let me point out that you are smearing them with statements like this. Nobody wants "bigger at any cost."  I've tried, and will continue, to say the same message to those in the other camp. When they smear Core, I've defended you.
To the extent anyone is threatening other peoples' lives and families, there is nothing to say other than that it's shameful and awful behavior and the absolute fastest way to lose an argument. I would never associate with such people; very few people would. 
Regarding the OP... they are not demands, in any form. They are suggestions,  from one person who cares about the project and the community, to another. The post is not derisive of Core. It is praise for what you guys are doing, and some sincere advice on a path to regaining the peace and space you need and deserve for your work. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 04:14:58
It is an appeal to the Core devs. It is most appropriately delivered where A) they have the highest likelihood of seeing it and B) have the lowest likelihood of dismissing it outright as an attack on them. If I was making an appeal to Classic, I'd post on where they would be most open to receiving it. You disagree? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:43:29
That roadmap is fine, except that it precludes any increase in blocksize, which a large portion of the community desires. Many of the things on that roadmap can be done with any size block.
And nobody is "pretending that [core's] technical opinions are meaningless." That is a disingenuous comment. People advocating Classic are, largely, very respectful of the Core devs and what they've done, but there is an honest disagreement, so an alternative client is being created. Smart and genuine people can disagree with each other.

It happened to me, personally, three times. It happened to the rest of the community enough to lead to a widespread perception of censorship. My recommendation in the OP was to fix that perception.

BU would be Bitcoin listed with a different name and symbol. That doesn't make it an altcoin, it makes it a fork of Bitcoin, and the market will figure out, with time, which version of Bitcoin it believes to be most valuable. 
I agree however that the split will absolutely damage Bitcoin's reputation, at least in the short term. However, the current civil war is, right now, damaging Bitcoin's reputation. The congestion and fees and confirmation uncertainty are, right now, damaging Bitcoin's reputation. 
A fork will at least take this civil war to its conclusion, and while it will be chaos in the markets (and public perception) for a while, Bitcoin will endure it and come out far stronger, with a community that has hopefully finished hating itself.

Statement was changed after I endorsed it (accidentally, I presume).

ShapeShift.io doesn't hold customer funds, so it doesn't have the risk mention in OP. However,  it is a good question... we are watching it carefully. If both coins persist, we will likely enable trading of both, but I imagine one will fall toward zero quite quickly and the "real" bitcoin will become clear.If the fork happens, which seems increasingly likely, I bet the Classic branch will win.

To those in this sub that read the above as "exchanges say BTU is an altcoin" you are missing the point. Exchanges are actually saying, "we are increasingly believing a HF is going to happen and here is how we are dealing with it practically." 
Calling the new fork BTU is about practical issues related to running continuous markets. It is not "labelling the new chain an altcoin."  Also stated in the announcement, is that if the fork chain (BTU) eventually becomes the clear dominance chain (upon a confluence of metrics), then it would be assigned the BTC symbol.

Bitcoin is largely built on a principle of inclusion. Censorship is largely antithetical to that principle. Core stood by while censorship happened, which enraged the community, fomenting distrust. Core should have, and should still, denounce the censorship if it wishes to earn back some of the goodwill and trust that it lost. 
I'm not sure if you consider those "facts," but it's the reality of the social situation as I see it. I've talked with numerous very prominent people in this industry who are upset greatly by Core's silence in the face of that censorship.

To clarify ShapeShift's position:
If a fork happens (with BU or anything similar in the future), ShapeShift will list it as a new coin (new name, new symbol). This is purely for practical reasons, not a judgement for or against. If the market decides to follow the BU chain, then after enough time, and with enough clarity on the market's decision (ie - not ambiguous), we would refer to that chain as Bitcoin and ShapeShift may reassign the name/ticker.
Hardforking from the main chain doesn't create an altcoin. It creates a decision point, on which every market participate must judge for himself. The outcome of those decisions, unpredictable ahead of time, is a more appropriate declaration of the true Bitcoin than any specific group within. Stated differently, if a majority doesn't get to declare what Bitcoin is, then certainly neither does a minority. It is a choice we're happy leaving to the market, anything else is the exact kind of centralization that Bitcoin was built to resist.
ShapeShift supports SegWit and a HF to larger blocksize, but does not support BU. We are seeing the utility of the Bitcoin network decay with time (while simultaneously becoming more expensive), and SegWit plus a HF to bigger blocks is the most practical and reasonable short and medium term solution. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:33:39
Sidechains don't kill alts. It just makes it more likely to create alts on top of BTC blockchain instead of independent blockchains. It changes how alts are built, not that they will be built.

I think larger blocks clearly cause more orphans... but to what extent? That's the debate. If it's 0.0001% more orphans, then who cares. If it is 50% more orphans, then it's a serious problem. Much of the blocksize debate revolves around the unknown extent of effects, not whether the effects are real things.

It's not a "lie." It's valuable to understand that SegWit helps with scaling, by fitting more txs into a block. It "effectively" increases blocksize. That doesn't mean blocks shouldn't be larger, but for anyone who is more interested in scaling than in "us vs. them" drama, SegWit is a great feature.

Jesus dude. The venom is strong with you.
1) Core is a political entity, whether you like it or not. It is political in that it must manage competing social demands from parties that all have stake in this project. This doesn't mean they should just become "political about everything" and spend their days culling favors. It does mean they need to appreciate that Bitcoin development, from the point of view of core maintainers, is about both technical work and social work. 
2) Thanks for mischaracterizing my statements about Garza (it's not Garzik, fyi). I said that he shouldn't be banned/exiled from the Miami Bitcoin conference last year, not that "people should support him." Do all your arguments rely on mischaracterizing other people's positions? (you call it a "paycoin conference" because paycoin was one of many sponsors?). I generally believe people should have the opportunity to speak, even if their beliefs are unpopular. At the time, he was very likely a scammer, but it was not clearly proven (it since has been). I'm not so gullible and weak-minded that I need controversial people and opinions hidden from me. 
And yes, "caveat emptor." It's also called being a responsible and aware adult, and making judgements for yourself as opposed to from the mob.

First, I didn't make any "demands". I made suggestions. Labelling them demands betrays your primary goal, which is to avoid addressing any of the content of my post. 
But, I won't give you the same disrespect. I'll address the content of your post.
1) What "attacks" from Roger are you speaking of? He is upset with the censorship, and believes a hard fork to bigger blocks soon is a good idea. You can disagree with those positions if you want, but what "attack" is he committing?
2) Okay, I denounce it. People shouldn't vote brigade. 
3) First, I doubt the fork would be contentious long enough to make it cost-effective for us to enable both BTC-1 and BTC-2 on ShapeShift. But if somehow it did last that long, I see no reason not to enable markets in commodities. In fact, I loved Ben Davenport's [piece]( about setting up futures markets for potential forks. Don't be scared of markets.
4) I don't think I've ever "supported" classic or core other than by listening to the arguments of various people on all sides of this debate and trying to help reduce mischaracterizations. Do you honestly want me to apologize for that activity?
5) Not going to apologize for building ShapeShift. 95% of my crypto wealth is in Bitcoin, and I believe Bitcoin will maintain its position as dominant money in this industry. At the same time, I believe there will be thousands of blockchain-based assets doing all manner of interesting things, and ShapeShift is built to make it effortless to convert any such digital token into any other.

@_date: 2017-03-07 23:13:21
Yes I would support a HF to a conservatively larger blocksize, such as 2MB proposed in OP. I'd like Core to plan it and commit to it. I don't want Core to be "replaced" and I think if this was handled by them the community could put a horrible chapter behind it. I also want SegWit to activate, and it's not going to until a compromise is found.
Stated differently, from my perspective, the risk to this project of not finding a reasonable compromise between the warring factions is significantly higher than the risk to this project from a well-planned HF.  
And no I didn't "sell all my coins." My stake in Bitcoin is, to put it mildly, significant. As are most people's who have been working on this project for years and care about it immensely.

If 99% of the community desires a change and moves forward with it, that is now an altcoin?

This is an absurd premise on which to architect and design Bitcoin.

That would be preferable, but it isn't going to happen. Core has clearly stated no intention of hardforking to increase blocksize any time in the foreseeable future. A great outcome for Bitcoin Classic would be if Core realizes the community is move away from them - that they are veering away from consensus, and correct their course. 
My reading of the community at this point is that a hard fork block increase is necessary and inevitable - it's just a question of whether Core does it or some other group.

I'm absolutely interested in capacity and absolutely not interested in political games, nor in removing core devs. I like the core devs, but I think in the area of the block size they are doing a grave disservice to the technology.
And nobody is "hostile" to segwit. I love segwit. Everyone loves segwit. Segwit is great, but it shouldn't continue to be considered a replacement for a modest block increase. 
It's troubling that when advocates for larger blocks speak up, the response is often, "stop whining, segwit is on the way."  SegWit brings 3-12 months of scale... and then we'll be right back to the same debate. 
A 2 or 4MB HF + SegWit is such a beautiful combination for 2-3 years of scale. Why isn't it on the roadmap?

I think the "average bitcoiner" these days is actually a user of Bitcoin for various needs, and not necessarily someone who follows the news and gossip of the community, so probably they are somewhat unaware of these issues (for better or worse). Can a contentious HF be prevented? I have no idea... the likelihood of it happening has increased with each iteration of the "rebellion" if you want to call it that. XT, then Classic, now BU... each project has made more progress toward a HF than the last. If BU fizzles out, I expect the tension to increase and another project to arise in the not too distant future. The tension keeps increasing because the congestion on the network is very real, and is harming real people &amp; businesses. Utility of Bitcoin is degrading, irrefutably. 
In my personal opinion, the only way to prevent a highly contentious HF is for Core itself to propose, plan, and advocate for a less contentious one (something like 4MB+SegWit). Short of that, even if SegWit alone is activated I don't think it will quell the market demand for more blockspace over the short/medium term and thus the potential of a contentious HF that splits the community becomes increasingly likely. 
Core could take all the wind out of the sails of these "rebellions" by offering a conservative blocksize increase (via HF) along with SegWit. I know some of them are open to that, but they haven't been willing to lead such an effort. If they did, they'd have my full support and advocacy. They resist the idea because a) HF's have risk (true), and b) they see it as backing down politically. Yet, they seem to be discounting the risk of a highly contentious HF. This worries me, for if a HF is "risky" as they correctly state, then far more risky is a HF that is brought about by a wholly new development team... and this is getting increasingly likely, if not with BU, than with its next iteration.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:39:49

Are they so vastly different in this case? Core is not opposed to a HF blocksize increase, in fact, they all assume and believe it will happen at some point. 


This is an unfair distinction. Everyone in this community values monetary sovereignty highly. Hell, that's why people are willing to stick with this project through so much drama. Few, if any, people in the "bigger blocks soon" camp simply care about "cheap transactions." They value that, sure, but Core values that too. Nobody wants expensive transactions, and everyone values monetary sovereignty. The groups just have some different paths to obtain both.
Denouncing the other side as "simply wanting cheap transactions" is being ungenerous to them, and is just as unhelpful as when the other side denounces Core for "wanting to be in control" or "being in the pocket of Blockstream."
People on all sides of this need to stop their attempts at finding creative ways to discount the opinions of the other. 
But again, thank you for the civil response. We need more comments like yours, regardless of their positions.

2) I didn't imply anything. I stated explicitly that Core was not responsible for the censorship, but that it was wrong for not speaking up against it. I'm not the only one who feels this way, and the suggestion that they address this issue is intended to move the discussion forward. It is a matter of diplomacy, empathy, and principle.

When Bitcoin flounders, I lose tons of money. I happen to have a decent chunk of Bitcoin, you know. Making a tiny margin on increased transaction volume between digital assets pales in comparison to what I stand to lose whenever Bitcoin price falls. Further, the entire blockchain industry is anchored to Bitcoin... a stronger Bitcoin helps the industry (and I argue the reverse is true as well, that a strong and diverse digital asset industry is in turn good for Bitcoin).  Keep on hating if you want to, but your assumptions of incentives are just wrong and is enabling you to be intellectually lazy, as the arguments involved require reason, not trollish hatred.

Both sides claim this about the other, and it's not helpful.
Here's the thing about SegWit... everyone loves it, and it helps Bitcoin no matter the size of blocks. In fact, its benefit is multiplied by the blocksize. So blocksize and SegWit are not mutually exclusive, and when the ultimate goal for many people is, "how can we scale bitcoin for maximum txs without substantially harming its structure," then anyone who was comfortable with 2MB should be comfortable and even more excited about a 2MB blocksize + SegWit. 
This is why SegWit has failed to derail the desire of many in the community to increase the blocksize. It may sound strange, but SegWit is almost irrelevant to the discussion, because it's not an either-or question, but rather one of 1MB+SegWit or 2MB+SegWit.
And try to take a step back for a sec and consider this point: If your goal is "more scalability" and there are two options in front of you:
1) Increase blocksize to 2MB with hardfork.
2) The Core roadmap with multiple parts, completely new concepts (like SegWit), and no plan for larger blocksize (which almost everyone agrees is appropriate at some point in the future)...
Which of the two is "more extreme?" Both have pros and cons. Both have some risks.  has hardfork risk, but  has "complicated new thing via softfork" risk. Perhaps  is more risky, but  more complex. Which is better? There are tradeoffs, and smart, genuine people disagree. 
Dismissing one side or the other as "extremists" is not really helpful. Both options are reasonable, intelligent, and understandable choices.

I don't know why it's a dichotomy. I want SegWit. I also want a HF to bigger blocks. Both together give the platform significant room for user adoption/growth while the really cool layer 2 solutions are developed. SegWit alone buys us 1-2 years. SegWit+HF buys us 2-5 years. I don't care which is done first (perhaps SegWit since it makes the HF safer apparently), but both should be done in my opinion.

They are not responsible for the conduct of the mods. But if mods are doing really shady stuff, it is strategically, not to mention ethically, wise to denounce it. Much of the emotional anger that is fueling the contentious hard fork threat comes from people who were very upset about the censorship. The censorship was not Core's fault, but they should really say something about it, formally.

@_date: 2016-01-29 23:27:40
Hehehe well props for trying to continue the metaphor :)
I don't think the choice you present is the correct one, and this is kind of the key to this whole disagreement. The two options are NOT mutually exclusive, yet many on both sides treat them as if they are.
When CampFork says, "Let's do bigger blocks," CampCore's general response is, "No, we are doing SegWit which gets you the 2MB size you wanted, but in a safer way."  This has never been sufficient to CampFork, because their goal isn't to get "to 2MB" but rather to get "to a higher level of scale."
SegWit is great in that it helps get to a higher level of scale. But nothing about it precludes, or even suggests, that a conservative hardfork to larger block sizes shouldn't ALSO be done. Indeed, SegWit makes a HF to 2MB even more attractive, because you'll then have roughly 4MB of effective tx scale.
So Core shouldn't keep saying, "Leave us alone, we're doing SegWit" when so many others are clamoring for larger blocks. **Both can and should be done** and Core can end the controversy by simply acknowledging that the HF to larger blocks will occur, and will be done within a reasonable timeframe. This addresses the desires of a huge portion of the community, and gives Core time and space to continue work peacefully on SegWit. 
Challenges between interests are often not so clearly win/win. In this case, it is, and yet Core is so focused on "building the well and getting water," and so convinced that that is what they should be doing, that they've become myopic and aren't realizing nobody is trying to stop them from that work... they just want to know when step 2 will happen, and that Core is ready to commit to that important project after SegWit.

Greg, I didn't ignore the roadmap. The roadmap is great. I explicitly referenced it in the OP and suggested that a commitment to hardforking to larger blocks could be added to that roadmap. 
When you say "stuff I personally agree with," you are (intentionally?) mischaracterizing my position. The suggestions in the OP are the things which I think give Core the power to pretty efficiently end the terrible debate, which I know you and everyone else (incl. me) wants. I don't really have a strong opinion on block sizes. 
I'm worried that you so quickly jump to miscategorizing my arguments and dismissing them. I'm trying to give you guys a tool to win. BTW feel free to reach out sometime, I'm evoorhees on skype.

Several comments from one person scattered around are not sufficient. This is part of the communications that Core needs to improve. Core needs to improve not because Core is "bad," but because Core is great, and is doing itself a terrible injustice by winning the technical battles while losing the social ones.

Classic is an intentional hardfork to 2MB blocks, that's all. SegWit makes blocks of any size (whether 1MB, 2MB or 100 MB) able to fit more transactions, and almost everyone loves SegWit, so it'll likely be added to whatever path Bitcoin proceeds with (whether Core or Classic or anything else). 
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:08:49
It's wise not to lump all altcoins into one group. Most altcoins are stupid/useless. Some, however do interesting things, and some do quite valuable things. Nubits/Tether/BitUSD all track the value of the US dollar - that is something Bitcoin cannot do, and thus they have their complimentary use case. Dash and Monero are far more private than Bitcoin, which is also valuable. Coins like NXT actually have an entire asset exchange built into them, which is very cool and which would not be appropriate to try and stick into Bitcoin's core software.
So in any case where an altcoin does something unique and useful, then it makes sense for it to have value and users. And while this is the minority of altcoins, that doesn't mean the entire altcoin industry should be dismissed.

"another evidence btc was a front to pump alts by undermining bitcoin"
was a front to pump alts? Or the mod is just sick of Bitcoin and is leaving. 
And here's your answer: "I think bitcoin is past the point of no return. There are a number of different routes that bitcoin could take this year, and as far as I can see, they all end up at the same destination; failure."
There are many people who are just leaving Bitcoin because of the impasse and the hostile environment. It's not a grand conspiracy to pump alts. It's people becoming disillusioned with one platform, finding less utility in it, and moving elsewhere.

We all want decentralization. While I'm not a BU supporter, I do agree with Roger on at least one point: The more widely Bitcoin is used, the more decentralized it can become, and the congestion, high fees, and uncertainty of confirmation depresses Bitcoin's ability to be used in wider use-cases. Congestion thus prevents, or reduces, use and thus curtails decentralization. Of course, I disagree with him in that I believe SegWit should be activated ASAP to help alleviate this problem.

I understand the analogy isn't perfect... it is a parable to describe the social situation happening in Bitcoin. It doesn't matter how many engineers are in either team (though I might suggest that "core dev engineers" are not the only ones who build Bitcoin - it is an entire industry of many types of people).
The fact is that a large portion of the community, however comprised, strongly desires a conservative HF to larger blocks, like 2 or 4MB. Their objectives could be addressed, and their worries laid to rest, if Core would simply look up from their project, realize the social antagonism going on, and take some steps to help the group heal. Sometimes I am concerned that engineers, brilliant though they may be, are unable to understand basic operations and strategies within a social system.

Core's position, though they haven't communicated it well at all, is that they do indeed intend on a hard fork to larger block size (likely the 2-4-8 plan).

I'd be happy to endorse any formal plan for a HF and/or for SegWit. I haven't yet seen a formal plan for a HF, and that's leading many in the community to believe (rightly or wrongly) that Core has little or no intention of planning/executing one.

What happened:  I helped draft (and agreed to) a document put together in tandem with several other exchanges. The final version differed (slightly or substantially, depending on your point of view) from what I agreed to. I think it was an innocent mistake, and I'm to blame for not reviewing it again in detail before it went out.
A couple sentences were removed which stated, basically, that the new symbol would be used for the new fork, but whichever side of the fork clearly "won" may eventually earn the BTC/Bitcoin name.  In other words, if the BU fork earned 95% of the hashrate and market cap, we'd consider that the "true bitcoin." Until it was very clear which won, we'd proceed with two symbols, with the new one going to BU.
The purpose of the letter was supposed to be "HF is increasingly likely, here is how we will deal with the ticker symbol and name for now."  Instead, with those sentences removed, it became "exchanges say BU is an altcoin."  This is unfortunate, and was not my intention.
For the record, I do not support BU, but I do support a 2-8MB HF+SegWit if Core would lead it. I also think the congestion on the network is seriously problematic and have written about it here ( and here (

You've made quite a leap in logic there. Me stating that a decentralized system that isn't used is not superior to a centralized system that is used should be a truism: something that isn't used has no utility, thus can't have more utility than something that is used. 
That statement of logic doesn't imply that I "don't care if Bitcoin becomes centralized." I've been in this industry since 2011 telling the world about the merits and importance of a decentralized monetary system.

"Communication" is not antithetical to "liberty-bringing effects." I think it's quite essential, actually, to the health of this project that the lead protocol maintainers and developers are able to earn and maintain support from the actual users of this technology. 
A Core team that bunkers up as an anointed priesthood is likely to be overthrown. I think some people don't realize how close to a contentious hard fork the community is getting. I like the Core devs, I want them to keep building the great things they're building. If they lose the heart of a large swath of the community, however, then they, and the project, are set back considerably.

These groups are not so far apart at all. All that is needed to bring them into reasonable consensus, is for the former to agree to a "reasonable timeframe" on the HF. Just put something in the roadmap with a reasonable time estimate.

Yes it absolutely is. Over the last six months, we've seen that this sub tends to upvote only news that is "bitcoin maximalist" in nature. Important stories about the industry (which used to be the bread and butter of this sub) are no longer important here unless something negative is said about alts, or about specific people that this sub likes to vilify. 
There is in fact a great deal of Bitcoin-relevant information that doesn't make it to this sub because of this sad phenomenon, and I wanted to call attention to it. 
The enemy is not the interconnected communities of blockchain technologists, but the fiat financial system. This sub has forgotten that. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:56:18
Yes absolutely. This is why the "fees in theory" and the "fees in reality" don't necessarily align. In any case, the fee situation in Bitcoin is bad and getting worse (mostly due to uncertainty, not the $0.50 avg fee itself).

It's interesting when someone uses the most frightful slippery slope argument possible, "if you do this, next thing you know the 21m cap will be lifted!", and in the same post claims that it is me that cannot distinguish FUD from reality.

I don't have evidence, and I'm not sure anyone does related to the number of people who support "bigger blocks soon".  My estimate that it is more than half the community is based on anecdotal observations... but I do alot of observing. More importantly, it doesn't matter if a group is a "majority"... rather that both groups are big enough to pay attention to, and not dismiss.

I've come across very few people who are not amenable to this... it's just a question of differing time frames. Thus there should be good ground for civil compromise on this issue. There is only one Core dev, to my knowledge, who doesn't want any increase in blocksize ever. The rest are not only okay with, but desire, a HF block increase "when appropriate."

1. Every tech company is wrapped in the tentacles of the NSA, not really fair to single CoinBase out for that.
2. They know everything about their clients because they are following an extremely conservative view of US AML/KYC laws. This is smart for them to do, they are the biggest company in Bitcoinland and they are essentially a bank, with fiat and bitcoin both. They are a huge onramp; it is strategically foolish for them to also put a target on their back.
3. Not true. They run multiple nodes. And experimenting with alternative implementations is a sign of decentralization... why should we advocate one monolithic implementation as gospel?

It's important to remember that nobody can take your chain away from you.

After discussion of HF-related solutions was banned from this sub, he became increasingly desperate to fix what he sees as the problem.

First, I don't support BU. Second, I disagree with your understanding of what constitutes aggression. That many in the community want to change an aspect of Bitcoin is not a coercive action on you or your property. You don't have property rights to the concept of the blockchain. You have property rights to your own Bitcoin, and nobody can take that away from you. You can hold those tokens, fork or no fork, as long as you want. BU may be offending you with their ideas, but they are not attacking you nor are they violating your property. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:31:40


That's exactly the kind of unhelpful smearing that degenerates the conversation. Do you really think everyone who wants larger blocks reasonably soon is a "VC puppet"? Or are you just saying that to vilify the other position and avoid meaningful discourse?

Nobody "rules over the network." Many people and groups have influence. 
Miners tend toward that chain which is most profitable at the margin. If miners back a coin that the community of users and businesses doesn't support, the price of that chain's token will fall and miners will only harm themselves.

First, have a beer. 1 beer
Second, I have staked no hard technical position on block sizes. Frankly, proper assessment of the "appropriate" size is beyond my expertise. I am sympathetic to many of the arguments on all sides of this issue. Crucially, I respect the people who know this stuff (and yes, they exist on both sides of the debate) enough to listen and consider their points. 
What I've found, from listening and respecting peoples' opinions, is that much of the divisiveness in the community is not a matter of profound disagreement about blocksize. Indeed, most of Core desires and plans to implement a hardfork to larger blocks at some point. Almost nobody believes 2MB (or even 4 MB) blocks would be highly damaging. People simply disagree on how to roll it out, when, and what to do beforehand. 
There is in fact considerable common ground, and if I can do anything, it is merely to attempt an increase of civility in the community so that these important discussions can happen. Few people here are enemies, though many have tricked themselves into assuming otherwise. 
As far as libertarianism, that isn't really relevant to the discussion. Libertarians generally advocate non-aggression. While heated, the civil war in Bitcoin is just intense intellectual disagreement, not a matter of coercion. And it doesn't seem appropriate to take the intellectual capital of Mises and Rothbard and use it to further either a big block or small block agenda ;)

The cause of delays is too many transactions for the current throughput of Bitcoin. The block size is the primary limiter - it is 1MB.
There is an intense debate surrounding whether and how to increase the block size. Unfortunately, that debate has been going on for a year, with no end in sight. Other solutions to the scaling issue are &gt;1 year away, and meanwhile Bitcoin has maxed out on usage.

Yeah understood, we need two different names for the two phenomenons. I've always understood "Gresham's Law" to apply specifically to the historical case of silver/gold ratio peg.
If a currency is debased, it's exchange rate will simply fall in the marketplace. Gresham's Law, regarding pegged exchange rates, is most useful in understanding why a peg doesn't work, and will drive one of the pegged assets from circulation. 
I think a different name is needed for the concept that people will tend to prefer an appreciating money over a depreciating money. It's related to Gresham's Law, but materially different.

Bitcoin price movements are always "mostly" speculation, but that speculation can be very enlightened, and over time, the portion of trading that is pure speculation has diminished. In 2011 it was probably 99.9%. Today it is probably 90%... still mostly speculation, but starting to trade increasingly on fundamental use and utility. In ten years, I'd expect 40% speculation and 60% fundamental use. It's a long and messy process from being non-existent to becoming a rational and widely used global asset.

@_date: 2016-06-08 16:41:23


Two responses to this.
1)  look at top left corner, Avg Fees stat, it typically varies between 5 and 40 cents per tx. If you're sending reliable txs at half a penny, what's your secret? Even the minimum rec of 0.0001 BTC for the simplest tx is over 5 cents at this point, and it's often necessary to pay double or triple that to get into a block "soon."
2) Even if 20 cent fees is small and reasonable in your opinion, it is going up fast, and if there are more than 5-7 txs per second that are important (thus their senders willing to pay high fees), then fees have to approach infinity. Bitcoin cannot handle more than 7 important txs per second right now, because even if fees were $1,000, the throughput can't exceed that.
It is an important problem. 
And thanks for continually regurgitating nonsense about Garza, I think it demonstrates the confidence you place in your fundamental arguments.

"cannot afford to make a mistake that could inflict damage to a $10 billion economy."
And what of mistakenly believing Bitcoin will continue to grow and win users in the marketplace if it becomes too costly and full of friction? Some devs are only concerned with technical risks to that $10b economy, and are blind to the market/competitive/UX risks that can equally sink a project.

If you want to be accurate in your opinions, Jeff has been working his balls off to help turn the NY Agreement into code, known now as SegWit2x. SegWit2x finally enabled SegWit to get enough miner support to activate, and most of the mining and business community remains committed to it.

Fees are routinely averaging $0.10 to $0.30 per tx currently, and asking people to go check various pricing sites just to send a reliable tx is a horrible user experience. 
The blocksize limit is unnecessarily adding friction, and the market will start routing around it the worse the problem gets. If people want to say there are other more important priorities, fine, but to deny the problem is blind.

He says those things not to "bash bitcoin", but because he is genuinely worried about its trajectory. Roger has been one of Bitcoin's most important supporters and investors for over five years.  You can disagree with him, but saying he is trying to "bash Bitcoin" is absurd.
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:20:35
He is desperate because, in his opinion, he sees the block size limit as causing serious risk to Bitcoin as a platform and this jeopardizes a project about which he cares immensely and to which he has dedicated his life for the past half decade, and in which he holds most of his wealth. He feels like the "peer to peer electronic cash system" which he was so excited about is being unnecessarily thwarted and changed into a settlement layer.
He is not "comparing Bitcoin to Starbucks." He is comparing block size to coffee supply as two consumer goods which, in his opinion,  should change to meet consumer demand, else alternatives will be increasingly sought by consumers. 
 
You can disagree with his assumptions or reasoning but if you dont make any effort to even understand people with whom you disagree then you'll live a very bitter, hateful, and unproductive life.

Collectivizing all the individuals who advocate larger blocks into one monolithic group with "one argument" and calling that one argument a fallacy is disingenuous and unhelpful to the discussion. 
There are many reasons and nuances to all sides of the debate - people advocate larger and smaller blocks for multiple reasons, some good, some foolish, some simply uninformed, on all sides. 
Please don't make the logical fallacy of assuming all people who disagree with a position to disagree with it for the exact same reason.

Avg actual fees are in the $0.10 to $0.30 range. It is getting expensive. It's already pricing out txs that are under $10. Bitcoin is losing its ability to be a P2P electronic cash system.

I have formally called out for censorship twice. After review, on one occassion I wasnt sure what the truth was. On the other, I was wrong, and I admitted as such. 
Regardless of those formal  calls, I am convinced censorship has occured in this sub (though I think the problem has largely diminished at this point). Discussion of 2MB blocks via a specific hard fork initiative (classic) was explicitly banned, and the problem was so bad several months ago that it caused the community to fracture, with some leaving this sub and formi g and now the two camps just throw bombs at each other.

Miners can never relax... at any given price, it is always a race toward zero profit (similar to any commodity production business). The recent rise in price is great for miners, but will be very quickly offset by more mining power coming online.

By looking at actual blocks in real life, not theoretical estimates of what might be needed to get into a block maybe.

Because of urgency. I work in a Bitcoin business and I use Bitcoin every day. I am seeing the consequences of frequently full blocks, the quickly increasing fees, and the uncertainty and UX issues that happen when people have no certainty if a TX will cost X or Y and whether it will arrive in X time or Y time. It is causing serious issues now, and I don't think people realize the urgency of addressing the throughput issue (you're correct it is throughput that is important ultimately, not blocksize) soon. 
Lightning network is awesome... but it is over a year away from production. SegWit is awesome, but it is 3-6 months out, and brings a 1.6x benefit which will be consumed roughly by the time it launches. Even if SegWit launched fully today, that buys us 2-6 more months and then we're stuck in the same urgent situation.
The reason people like Roger and myself advocate larger blocks (not to the exclusion of any other options) is because it is a relatively quick and simple change to the protocol which can bring 1-2 years of scale while the more advanced and complicated features are implemented.
Our opinions are dismissed because "we're not devs."  But Bitcoin is not just software, it is a whole ecosystem, and the ultimate users of Bitcoin as a financial platform are what give this system value in the first place. Those people, the users, are getting hurt now. Businesses are seeing this, and starting to migrate to Ethereum, in anticipation that users will prefer faster and cheaper transactions as opposed to those with high friction.  Bitcoin is not supposed to be high friction, but the congrestion is turning it into that. If it is not addressed, Bitcoin will stagnate. I say this as someone who has been in the industry for over five years, who has most of my wealth in this asset, and who care more about this project than most people.

Arguing with Satoshi? I'm just conveying math from actual blocks that are happening. I did click the link, it's a great theoretical estimate of future fees based on an algo with certain assumptions.
In reality, if you want to know what's going on, all you need to do is watch actual blocks and divide fees by number of txs. 
For example, the most recent block as of writing: 
999k block (thus full). 1160 txs and $160 in fees, thus about $0.11 avg fee per tx.

More accurately, it is a 2MB base block, with SegWit, which has the effect of providing up to 2-4x the space of the base block.  While an "effectively 8MB" block could exist, it is highly unlikely in real use. 
SegWit2x will provide realistically around 4x the capacity of today's Bitcoin, with the other benefits afforded by SegWit.

If the can is interfering with things, some times it may be appropriate to kick it a ways down the road while more lasting solutions are worked on. I dont think Roger is suggesting that block size is the only useful tool in the scaling arsenal.
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:00:18
First, SegWit is 1.6x, not 2x, but whatev.
None of those things are happening (with possible exception of SegWit) within next 3-6 months. This is what I mean by urgency. There is lots of cool tech solutions over time, and I've never belittled those. My worry is if Bitcoin's roadmap has only a 1.6x throughput over the next year, the platform is in serious trouble. If Core said, "we understand scale is urgent, but this is the only safe way to proceed" then I could sympathize with that. But I get no feeling of urgency from many in the community.
People moving to other platforms due to too much friction in Bitcoin is a serious risk to the project. Not to toot my own horn, but I am probably better positioned than most to make a statement like that.

You're just forwarding a slippery slope argument. If blocks will be "always full" then why don't we set blocks at 100kb?  
A rational person can advocate a 2MB block size, and that doesn't mean the same person would advocate 4 MB or 100 MB. There are gradient's of cost-benefit, and many right now believe 1MB block size at this stage in Bitcoin's development is too small, prematurely accelerating a fee market before Bitcoin has gained enough traction as a payments platform.

Impossible?  Not with 90%+ miner support.
More time is always better than less time, but the time is up. Core could've organized and planned a very conservative HF 12 months in advance if they had wanted to. They refused to bring the community together toward this goal, so now we have factions splintering off and more risky hard forks occurring. 
For a bunch of engineers, they seem unable to properly account for the risks and dynamics of Bitcoin as an ecosystem.

You just (correctly) stated that SegWit2x will provide up to 8x the capacity of today's Bitcoin. You believe that extra capacity will be gone within "a few months?"  
The reality is this capacity, provided by both SegWit and the 2MB base block (earning up to 8x more space than we have today), will give the platform 1-4 years of growth on chain. Turns out, that's a great window in which layer 2 solutions like lighting, etc can be deployed commercially. 
And that's the entire reason this is happening.

That's because only 0.15 nodes will exclude SegWit2x nodes. Since most nodes will not be 0.15, blocks and transactions will disseminate normally.

First, not everyone who supports SegWit2x is identical in thought. Some of them do indeed want to "fire core," and many others don't.

@_date: 2017-08-04 22:30:02


lol it didn't even do anything. SegWit activated because SegWit2x plan got the stakeholders together.  If SegWit2x hadn't occurred, SegWit wouldn't have activated before Aug 1st, and UASF would've caused a HF between the UASF'ers and the majority of the mining community.

SegWit2x is why SegWit, the first part of the upgrade, happened in the first place, and November will be the second part of the upgrade with the 2MB base block.
Just as it is really childish for people to say "Blockstream has taken over Bitcoin!!" It is similarly childish to say the same about other groups of people who are working to make Bitcoin better.
It's fine to disagree. Let's stop with the name-calling and vilification.

You seem to have made a common mistake... assuming Bitcoin is solely a technical project.  In reality, it is a project of engineering, economics, politics, social behavior, game theory, business, and philosophy.

Who is "they?" The signers of the NY Agreement (ie SegWit2x supporters) had nothing to do with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. 
The fact remains: &gt;90% of miners and most Bitcoin companies continue to support the SegWit2x plan. This support finally enabled SegWit to be activated, and will be followed by the 2MB base block HF in November. Anyone who wants to remain on the minority chain is, of course, welcomed to do so, and the market will determine the outcome.

If there is a technical problem, an exchange needs to stop trading to deal with it. There is nothing nefarious about that. They communicated well the whole time. 
They didn't "tell people to resume 20% lower."  The market moved down 20% (and continues to fall). This isn't BFX's fault.

The super majority of miners and most of the large businesses continue to support SegWit2x. Unless that changes, anti-SegWit2x folks will find themselves forked out of consensus and on the minority chain. 
The rest of us will continue on with SegWit and with a larger base block... two things which should have been done a year ago.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:34:42
Here's the belief, it is very simple:  SegWit stalled and was unable to get activated for 2+ years. Scaling debate raged.  Then some people decided enough is enough, and executed the simple concept of tying SegWit and a 2MB base block together, bringing substantial portions of two warring factions together, and then everything finally started moving forward. SegWit activates today, and a 2MB block will occur in November.
I greatly respect your technical prowess Greg, and I'm someone that hopes you're involved in whatever form Bitcoin takes in the future. But I wish you would appreciate that to get SegWit passed, it required a different perspective on Bitcoin: not as purely a technical system, but an entire ecosystem of technical, economic, and social interests. One of Bitcoin's strengths, interestingly, is that it is not understood perfectly by a small handful of talented engineers.
Regardless, today is SegWit day, and we can all celebrate that.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:31:23

I expect people will disagree on this point forever. There is no way to know what effect the UASF threat had on the NY Agreement or on getting SegWit passed.

SegWit is already locked in. It is now inevitable. Thus, "signaling to get SegWit activated" is no longer necessary. Thus, since the signaling continues, it likely means the miners want to continue with the NY Agreement and do the second part of that agreement, the 2MB base block, in November. 
After all, the miners were generally the ones most interested in bigger blocks, not SegWit. Why would they be signaling SegWit2x just for SegWit, and not for the 2x?  That doesn't make sense.

Personally I understand the arguments regarding replay protection. I'm somewhat agnostic on it, not because it's not important, but because there are good arguments on both sides. 
The arguments against adding it are twofold I believe:
1) Replay protection would break all wallets, which support literally millions of users, requiring them to upgrade (which then risks other bugs, etc). That is dangerous.
2) If it is true that a supermajority of "the bitcoin community" is moving ahead with this upgrade, why should it add risk to the supermajority (see  above) so that a minority can continue on easily with the minority chain?  90%+ of miners are moving ahead with SegWit2x, as well as the biggest wallet companies and many other companies in the industry. We know many people are vociferously opposed, but again they are a small minority of users (Coinbase adds the entirety of subscribers every 2 weeks). 
On the other side, there are good arguments to add replay protection as well. I remain agnostic and undecided. Further discussion is happening on this here: 
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:15:57
How did Bitmain/Jihan break the agreement? They did exactly what they said they would. They signalled for SegWit2x, they continued doing so until SegWit was activated, and they have continued mining on the main Bitcoin chain. They have not mined on Bitcoin Cash whatsoever.
Where is the breach of agreement?

Gresham's Law doesn't apply to Bitcoin, and is wholly irrelevant to the block size debate.
Greasham's Law applies only when there is an artificial peg between assets. It came about when silver and gold coins were both circulating as money, and the government mandated a fixed exchange rate between the two metals. Since the actual value of the two metals changes over time, and yet they had a fixed exchange rate, the wholly predictable result was that the undervalued one was hoarded and overvalued one was spent (thus, bad money drove out the good from circulation).
Without a fixed price peg, there is no relevance to Gresham's Law in a monetary context, and none of this matters to block size debate. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:17:21


First, that is a false dichotomy, because the "best technology" is run/used/built by people. Bitcoin is as much a social project as it is a technical one, and tragically Core has failed to appreciate this.
Fact: there are very smart engineers who disagree on what the "best technology path" is. Bitcoin and blockchains more broadly have many local maxima - many features around which optimizations can occur. Some of these are maximized to the detriment of others, and thus what is "best" depends on personal assumptions and priorities. 
There is no "objective best." There are many possible upgrades, with different costs and benefits. Bringing consensus around a set of upgrades is a social process (you call it "political" to disparage it). As great as SegWit is, Core was unable to get anywhere close to consensus on it. SegWit2x, and the NY Agreement, stepped in after two years of failure in this regard and put something to the market that got SegWit passed. Doing so required a 2MB base block, so that's what's happening, because that's what consensus has formed around.
I understand some people are mad that they don't get 100% their way, but Bitcoin doesn't belong to any person, or group of people. It will move in the direction around which consensus forms in the open market. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:17:58

Which miners are you referring to?  ViaBTC is the primary Bitcoin Cash miner, and was not a signer of the NY Agreement, so they didn't break anything. Bitmain continues to mine on the main chain (not Bitcoin Cash), so they have upheld their commitment to NY Agreement. 
Where are you getting your information from? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:22:15


Except that it was exactly a compromise. It was a compromise between the big miners, who wanted larger blocks and thus wouldn't activate SegWit, and those who wanted SegWit, but were unsure about larger blocks.
They came together and agreed to make both happen for the good of Bitcoin. 
And despite the continued vilification of people who build, by people who don't build, SegWit2x remains on track and on course for November. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:57:41
Your analysis is correct, except you forgot to mention that all the largest wallets are supporting SegWit2x also.

No.  ViaBTC was not part of the treaty.  Bitmain, which was part of the treaty, continues mining on the main chain and has done exactly what it said it'd do.
Virtually all of the signers of the NY Agreement, except perhaps Bitcoin.com's pool, have remained committed to it.  The Bitcoin Cash fork had zero to do with the parties involved with SegWit2x.

When two sides disagree on something, a compromise is when both are brought to the table and agree to push something forward together. Bitcoin Cash, and SegWit2x, are both evidence that SegWit was not a meaningful compromise - it failed to bring the factions together. Let's stop the stupid meme.

Is that the intention? Or is the intention to get SegWit and 2MB base blocks on the Bitcoin network in a manner that has buy-in from a supermajority of miners?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:19:38


They designed/wrote SegWit. Getting it actually implemented required bringing miner support on board, which they were unable to do after 2+ years.  
So others of us have taken it upon ourselves to get SegWit activated. Doing so required a 2MB base block as well, thus SegWit2x happened. 
I'm not one of those who is "anti Core." However, I also know that Bitcoin is more than a piece of software. It is an industry, and a community. Core's inability to bring consensus around SegWit demonstrates that they remain unable to appreciate how diverse and complex this project actually is. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:23:18
SegWit locked in (and will activate, guaranteed now) because 2X is happening. That's what got SegWit to lock in, after 2+ years of bickering.

You're very sure of that, I can tell by the bold! But I bet if blocks were 2x as big, then 2x as many transactions would fit. Some scale obviously can be done in the blockchain itself, just as if you cut blocksize to 500kb, Bitcoin would scale down.

I was never against SegWit. I have advocated for it since it was announced, and ShapeShift was the largest sender of SegWit BTC transactions when we implemented SegWit last fall.

Nonsense propaganda. S2X was designed as a proposal to get both SegWit and a 2MB base block hard fork activated, by promising the latter to the miners in order to obtain the former. SegWit hadn't received more than \~40&amp; miner support for over a year, it was flat and stagnant. S2X was meant to break through that stalemate, and it did so. After SegWit activation however there were \~3 months until the 2MB base block HF, and in that time community sentiment  turned against the fork, and it was called off a couple weeks prior to occurring (yet SegWit remained active).

I fully agree with you that security standards are crucial, and many in the industry have failed to achieve professionalism in this regard thus far. However, that doesn't mean that security standards ought to be FORCED upon the industry by coercive government. Further, consider the very valuable security improvements we've already seen from the market itself. Multisig, proof-of-reserves, etc. ShapeShift itself establishes a secure model by simply not holding customer money at all. There are many paths to security, and it's an evolving and messy process. Mandating the rules from above is a lazy way to feign accomplishment in this regard. Security, as with all goods and services, is best produced in the marketplace - among competition, price signals, and the profit motive.

It seems the code was bad, and there are no excuses for that.
SegWit2x got SegWit activated, and while I wish the HF to a larger block could've happened as well (admittedly with better code review), I think SegWit was important enough to justify the NYA. 
Ultimately, the market didnt seem to want the 2MB block, and thus I and several others stopped pushing for it over a week ago.
I've certainly learned some lessons from this process, and I will be staying out of future scaling debates.

Bitcoin is about getting back the OPTION of having control of one's money (ie - the power, the discretional authority, to do so). There are many cases, for many people, wherein it makes more sense to leave control or partial control with another party. This doesn't make the person a non-Bitcoiner. One doesn't need to run a full node to participate, contribute to, or get benefit from this alternative monetary system.
The brilliance of Bitcoin is that one may hold the keys to one's wealth, not that one MUST hold those keys.

Not true at all. When the GLD ETF opened for trading, it did not start at $0. In fact... I'm not aware of any stock that ever started at $0. The first bid for an asset is something non-zero, and even so, I didn't use $0 as the basis for my metric. I used $0.01. Very few assets ever trade on an open market with a starting price of $0.01 and rise to $280 within six years. Show me one, if you're aware of an example.

Ehhh I like the sentiment in that quote, and I believe the price of Bitcoin in the future will be far higher, but I don't think that means that $250 today is not "correct."  The price today, even if far below the one we expect tomorrow, is "low" because the risk of failure is very real. Bitcoin may be worth $10,000, but only if it succeeds... and that's not guaranteed. It could all go to zero, so that risk is part of the price, and why some people may feel it is perpetually "undervalued."

- Not being a custodian doesn't exempt one from the BitLicense, which states that anyone who exchanges digital currency for other digital currency is included in its scope. 
- Someone using Monero doesn't need to mix coins, thus would get no "mixing" benefit from ShapeShift. Someone that does want to mix coins, on the other hand, will get no benefit from ShapeShift because the transactions are visible on the blockchain and can be easily linked.
- Nothing will hinder a hostile administration, but I refuse to halt financial innovation in order to coddle political Luddites who have no understanding of this technology, and who use scare tactics and shiny badges to keep people running back to the banking system which has been laundering hundreds of billions of dollars, despite being in perhaps the most heavily regulated industry on Earth.

Any size of an economy could be represented in gold, or any other asset. The world doesn't use fiat because "the economy is so big." It uses fiat because governments prefer fiat, for it permits them to print money, which is to say, it permits them to steal wealth via inflation.

VGNPWR - Erik from ShapeShift here. What happened, as we told you in our mail to you already, was that you told ShapeShift to send your Spells of Genesis card to your CoinBase account. You entered a CoinBase address, so ShapeShift sent the asset there. Spells of Genesis cards are Counterparty assets, and thus require a Counterparty wallet in which to hold them. 
We mention this directly in our blog post regarding the Spells of Genesis card, "A Counterparty wallet is required in order to deliver the card to you".  Source: 
Now, normally, if you had given us a Bitcoin address from a normal wallet, you could export the key into a Counterparty wallet and the asset would appear. Since you were using CoinBase, you need to ask CoinBase to provide your private key (because they have it). I don't know if CoinBase will do this, but ShapeShift delivered the card exactly where you told us to.
I understanding this is frustrating, but this is ultimately your mistake. We're happy to corroborate any information if CoinBase needs it, just let us know. 
EDIT:  After considering this a little, we will send you a card anyway and we'll eat the loss. We'll try to be even more clear about the Counterparty requirement for next week's sale. Please email support at shapeshift.io again and give us a Counterparty wallet address to send the card to you. I recommend Counterwallet.io

"We" use fiat because governments mandate it through legal tender laws. And they do this so that the may inflate the currency, thereby debasing it and stealing its value.

If the nodes are awaiting a bigger block then obviously they'd be stuck, because SegWit2x fork was called off and no (or few) miners would be mining blocks.

We accept thousands of zero-conf transactions. We don't need it to be impossible to double-spend, we just need to mitigate the risk sufficiently to where it can still make business sense. An occasional double-spend against us is worth the cost for the improved user experience.

Clearly we need to tweak the system further... it's an ongoing process.

Companies always charge as high as they can for goods and services. As they should. And competition and arbitrage tends to keep these prices in check. As they should.

"Backing" when it comes to currencies and financial assets is an important word. Bitcoin is NOT "backed" by anything. It is, itself, an asset.  When something is "backed" it means there is a party who promises redemption of the thing for something else. When currencies were backed by gold, for example, it was because banks and/or governments promised to redeem the currencies for a fixed amount of metal. That is backing. Bitcoin is not backed, and it doesn't need to be, because it is itself an asset (just as corn is not backed by anything, nor is gold, nor are automobiles).

My opinion, however, is that I don't think any of the outcomes destroy Bitcoin, though they may change how it is used. I'm not too concerned either way. When there is this much debate among very smart people, perhaps the true answer is that either path is okay.  The block size should probably increase, but how and when? Not sure. And that's really the debate, how and when, not if.

I think the Greek government selling state-owned assets to pay off state-incurred debts is actually one of the most reasonable ideas that has been conjured (much more ethical than taxing people). It would be best, indeed, if every state asset was sold/privatized, and if the government was henceforth never able to take on debt ever again.

@_date: 2017-04-20 14:00:08


This isn't correct. Just because something is priced as "$100 of Bitcoin" doesn't mean Bitcoin is anchored to dollars in any way. I could give someone "5 pizzas worth of Bitcoin" also, and it wouldn't mean Bitcoin is "anchored" to pizza. 
Any good on Earth can be expressed as an exchange rate with any other good. You can have 7 apples worth of bananas, or 15 Subaru's worth of Toyotas, or 2000 lawn chairs worth of Xbox's. A chair is worth 20 carpet tiles. A skyscraper is worth 15,000 diamond rings. None of these items are anchored to any other, merely because they are expressed at a given time in terms of the other. Same with Bitcoin and dollars and euros and gold. 
Further, you don't need to create "your own entire ecosystem." Every marginal transaction done without fiat is progress, and there are currently 200,000 transactions a day that are non-fiat. The transformation doesn't happen by everyone suddenly switching and only "pricing in BTC." It happens marginally by people finding ways to use Bitcoin instead of dollars.

Bitcoin's great virtue isn't its blockchain,  which is merely a means to an end. Rather, its great virtue (and the end for which the means exists), is trustlessness. Any other blockchain project, while it may provide corollary benefits and be useful for certain things, won't achieve the great virtue of trustlessness without another breakthrough as great and pround as the blockchain itself. 
Trustlessness is the virtue on which to focus, not the blockchain which enables it.

Its not quite that simple. Since we are sending BTC from literally thousands of possible outputs the exact fee can’t be calculated until the time of transaction, which means if users choose, many will simply get stuck in the mempool and then we are dealing with angry customers. We process about 20,000 orders per day, so even a 5% delay rate means 1,000 pissed off people and all the support and brand damage that goes along with it. And that’s just one day.

ShapeShift has limits on all exchanges, there isn't anything unique to Tether, and this is done mostly due to order book depth issues (since ShapeShift offers a fixed exchange rate, we can't convert 100,000 LTC for example in one go).

Soooo first, pretty crazy news. I try to be skeptical of everything I read, especially if the source is just one person. I'd love if anyone can validate Greg's claims (I don't distrust him, but I like corroboration).
Second, if it is true, it *doesn't* mean Bitmain was blocking SegWit because of it, necessarily. It *might* mean that, and it certainly looks horrible, but again I try not to jump to conclusions. If it is however the case that it is true, and Bitmain was blocking SegWit primarily because of this conflict of interest, then that's really bad. 
I just want SegWit to happen already... I really hope a path forward is found.

Some measure of generalization is necessary, of course.  But, with respect, characterizing all the opinions of everyone who is in favor of larger blocks reasonably soon as "they want HF NOW" is not fair or helpful. 
I agree there are some angsty individuals on but that's no different than Don't paint the group based on the behavior of the worst among them. This is the same message I have given to who say things like "well they censor everything!" or "well they're all in the pay of Blockstream!" etc.  Characterizing entire groups in "one specific way" is usually a recipe for miscommunication at best, and escalating animosity at worst.

This actually understates the effect significantly. Mining is a small margin business, correct, and if this exploit boosts production by 30%, then it actually increases net profit by a huge multiple of that.
Example - if you mine $100 in revenue, and it costs $99 in expenses, then you make $1 in profit. If a special exploit reduces an input cost (energy) by 30%, then perhaps to mine $100 in revenue you now only have $95 in expenses. In such case, profit went from $1 to $5... meaning 400% increase in profit from a 30% reduction in energy cost. Who knows how the real numbers play out, but actual effect on bottom line could be massive.

It's called SegWit2MB, because it's SegWit+2MB base block HF, despite your rhetorical renaming. It is not a stall attempt. Notice how nothing is happening right now, and SegWit signaling has been stalled for months? Plans to change the status quo are not stall attempts, they are attempts at changing the state of play, which is currently making everyone miserable. If you're just going to assume bad intentions on behalf of other people who don't agree with you 100%, you're never going to actually know what those people are wanting nor doing.

I don't think the desire is to "rush things." The desire is simply to get a HF block increase on the roadmap in a "reasonable" timeframe. And while a developer super majority is important (though I'll mention it is a core dev super majority, and there are many other devs out there who don't feel the same as them), other stakeholders are important also. Bitcoin is an ecosystem with many groups of important people, and ignoring the points from one group is as bad as ignoring from another. 
I can tell you that many on the business side of things - specifically wallets with millions of users - are really concerned about blocks filling up. Dismissing their concerns is both dangerous and myopic. 
And again, the whole debate could be reasonably settled, and everyone back to work, with a simple addition to the formal roadmap of a HF block increase to a conservative size, and in a reasonable timeframe. Doesn't need to displace SegWit, just needs to be there... somewhere. Otherwise the threat of contentious hard fork is going to continue looming, depressing the price of Bitcoin significantly, and making everyone less productive while they worry through the uncertainty.

1-1.5 years away for the HF block increase is longer than most people (pro bigger blocks) want, but I think it can be workable if A) SegWit does indeed deliver some relief from block congestion and B) if Core actually commits to it happening by Summer 2017 (and yes, I know Core's position, "we can't force a fork"), but in practice, everyone watching knows a HF will happen with widespread support so long as Core stewards it. If the HF is always just "some day in the future" with zero commitment from Core, the angst and community tension will remain, and further XT/Classic movements will keep springing up.

I don't think he'd lie either. But sometimes people are wrong... or they are right on some facts and not others (like maybe Bitmain is using this exploit, but maybe SegWit doesn't actually block it). In any case, it merits scrutiny and review. If Greg has all the facts and implications right, he deserves a great deal of praise.


I wouldn't make that assumption immediately. I try to maintain a high burden of proof. It's for this same reason that when anti-Core people claim things like "core devs are all in the pocket of blockstream because sidechains/lightning" I also avoid that judgement. Incentive toward compromised judgement doesn't mean compromised judgement occurred, necessarily. There are a lot of witch hunts in this industry. It is *possible* that Bitmain truly believes SegWit is not the right path forward for scaling, and would think and advocate this regardless of this secret exploit. I'm really not trying to defend them, I'm trying to remain skeptical of all assertions without high burdens of proof.
In any case, there is certainly a horrible incentive to cloud judgement here and that's worrying regardless.

My entire argument is that a hard fork is becoming increasingly likely (XT, Classic, BU, next?). If something isn't done to alleviate the growing social antagonism, then the hard fork will be highly contentious and really dangerous. Alternatively people could work toward a solution that actually resolves the social strife that's occurring, and I would propose a Core-led SegWit+2MB hard fork as the best method of accomplishing that.

Your hospital got 6.5x and has what potential for growth? SatoshiDICE could, quite reasonably, double in usage within a matter of months. And if the hospital's 6.5x multiple was on EBIDTA, it means its multiple on net profits was actually higher than 6.5x. 
Put simply, SatoshiDICE is a highly speculative investment, with high risk and high significant appreciation potential. Even with this appreciation potential, it still pays dividends from day one equal to 100% of net earnings. Is it riskier than investing in a hospital at 6.5x EBITDA? Yes. Bitcoin itself is far riskier than that.
Again, if the market disagrees with 10x multiple on current profits, that's perfectly fine. That's merely the price at which I'm willing to part with 10% of it.  Even after Facebook's dismal halving of price, it's still trading at a 65x multiple. SatoshiDICE is 10x.

BitInstant's response to Dmytri:

Cheapest Method:
1) open account with Dwolla
2) fund Dwolla account from your bank
3) Transfer Dwolla to MtGox.
(Will take 1-3 weeks for all of this if you don't have Dwolla account yet)
Best Method:
1) Use BitInstant.com cash deposits, do $1 or $2k per day
2) Have the funds transferred either to a Gox account, or directly to a BTC address (BitInstant will auto-convert for you, small fee added)
(Will take far less time... like 30 minutes per deposit to get your coins)
While BitInstant's method has fees on it, you get the coins far faster, and this may save you money if the exchange rate is moving up. If you wait 1-3 weeks to do the cheap method, you might end up paying far higher. The phrase "penny wise and pound foolish" applies here...

I guess an outsider doesn't know it like I do. But I can tell you that as an insider, I'm only willing to sell 10%, and only willing to sell it at the price listed. 
And this whole thing about "a ten year payout" is silly. You can own shares for a year, earn 10% on your money, then sell. If the site grew during that time, your shares will have appreciated meaning you made more than 10%, and if the site shrinks then your shares fall and you'll make less than 10%. It all depends on your time preferences, but nobody's money is "locked" in the site for a decade... that's merely the time at which you've doubled your money assuming zero growth in the site's popularity.

Wow, you're totally misreading things. You're suggesting I price it lower? It's not worth it to me then, and I'd rather just keep the profits as the site earns them. Perhaps you're forgetting this is a cash cow, keeping the shares to myself is reward enough.  If I priced this "on par" as you're suggesting, I'd be selling 10% of the company for roughly 3k btc. The site makes almost that much per month in profits (verifiable transparent profits, not "mystical pirate profits"). Selling "on par" would be ripping myself off... even selling for 5x P/E would be ripping myself off. The 10x level was what I was comfortable with, so if people want to own part of the site, that's the IPO price.

If they tried, the marginal cost per coin would launch so high that every crazy libertarian bitcoiner would suddenly become a billionaire and overthrow that government.
In all seriousness, costs would skyrocket. They could buy a few million bitcoins, but very quickly it'd be apparent that someone was trying to buy tons and, well, let's just say the market would take care of it.
Remember that even if the gov bought all but a few coins, those coins would be worth billions a piece and since each can be divided by 10 million, you'd still have a currency that works just as well as we have today. The only difference is that every bitcoiner would be filthy rich.

Are you talking about mining or buying coins for speculation purposes?  Mining will always tend toward zero profitability, and it probably best to stay away from unless you have very cheap electricity or already have the equipment. If you think the price of Bitcoins is going to rise, probably better just to buy the coins than try to mine them. Mining is a specialized field, and just as most people who are involved in the gold market don't mine gold, the same will be increasingly true for Bitcoin.

Governments are always motivated to abandon limitations placed upon them. Gold limits the expenditures of a state to only what the state generates in revenue or borrows... this is not acceptable for most politicans, who wish to provide candy to everyone. Thus, the gold standard was dropped, and myriad reasons were cited to justify the fact that government merely wanted more power - the power to spend what it did not have.
Bitcoin, as a scarce commodity, would place the same restrictions upon a government as gold. The reason Bitcoin is valuable even without being adopted by a government, is that it offers shelter from perpetually debased currency.

Most of the devs didn't support the UASF, largely because it would cause (and almost did cause) a contentious fork since the majority of miners didn't support it. The New York Agreement, which actually brought people together to find common ground, instead of trying to exile miners, succeeded in achieving 95% mining support for SegWit, which activated immediately thereafter.  Without the New York Agreement, UASF would've split the network and things would've looked very different last summer/fall.

I think the term "debt based" overly complicates the issue. If USD fiat was created by the Treasury WITHOUT debt of the Federal Reserve, the USD would still be a terrible and immoral currency. The problem is not that the Fed loans new dollars to Treasury, but rather that the Fed can create the dollars in the first place.
Bitcoin solves this by bestowing no party with a special privilege to create new money. Inflation is pre-determined and drops to zero over time. Bitcoin's value doesn't come so much from the fact that it's not "debt based" as from the simple fact that it is a scare resource which cannot be perpetually inflated.

I don't know what the fastest way is. I am not optimistic that "the remaining miners" will get on board with what you prefer. If SegWit2MB could make it happen faster, I'll heartily support it. If SegWit2MB isn't needed to make SegWit happen soon, that's fine too. I disagree with Back about his assumption that hardfork requires 1-2 years of lead time. If his goal in stating that is "perfect safety" then it's an illusory goal, and if the community has to wait 1-2 years for a bigger block HF then I think the "perfect safety" he's seeking will be displaced by increasing risk of contentious hard fork... which won't wait for his preferred timeframe.

All of those things can be true. And btw it is generally much easier to add support for a new coin that is a fork of BTC (BCH in this case) than it is to change product systems to support SegWit. SegWit was generally a harder upgrade than adding support for BCH.

1) I chose MPEx because I don't like there to be only one exchange in Bitcoin world. I love GLBSE, but just wanted to diversify things. I don't get any part of MPEx sign up fee and am not compensated for anything having to do with that site. 
2) If a fraction is sold, it'll still be treated according to the contract. It's already receiving bids of over a couple thousand BTC, regardless.
3) You should chat with mircea_popescu on  for any questions related to the exchange MPEx itself.
4) Good question. Business increased even while BTC nominally appreciated. Growth in nominal BTC has been steady, regardless of USD/BTC exchange rate. This means profits in USD values grew substantially over the past few months.

You need to go back and look at the timeline. The large majority of miners changed after the NY Agreement, moving SegWit support from &lt;40% to over 90% within a day or two of the NYA. It did not appear to be directly caused by UASF, which had been going on for weeks prior to that.

This is such BS. Most of us who were pro-larger blocks are ALSO pro-SegWit. And many of us who implemented SegWit after activation did it faster than the Core dev team in the bitcoind wallet software itself. Please stop this propagandistic crap trying to make enemies out of everyone.

You aren't wrong (and thank you for being civil). The issue is about what plan can actually achieve consensus. The more intricate the plan, the harder to get consensus. A HF to 2mb + SegWit is already controversial. If the HF was more complex, then consensus would be more difficult to achieve.

It's doubling the base block to 2MB, please be factually accurate. SegWit in addition, enables the effective size to be 4-8x the capacity of today, but it is not an 8MB block.
This distinction is important because the 8x mentioned above is only theoretically possible, and would never happen in reality (the entire userbase would need to craft transactions that maximized witness data for that theoretical limit to be hit).

Okay on laptop now...  I don't "support a hardfork." Frankly, I'd like to avoid a hardfork. But I do support the SegWit2x plan, which was made of two parts, SegWit activation, which we've all enjoyed now, and the 2MB block upgrade.
Since the miners are overwhelmingly in support, as are the biggest wallets in the world, there doesn't need to be a chain split at all. There will be a chainsplit, however, because some portion of the community will not go along with the hashpower consensus.  
I know I won't convince you, but why should the vast majority of miners help enable and protect a minority breakaway chain? That encourages and prolongs a chainsplit. 
If this was a 50/50 situation, or anything close, then I would take your side of the argument... 2-way replay protection would probably be prudent and correct. But when ~95% of miners are upgrading to 2MB, adding replay protection a) helps the minority chain, b) encourages the chain split, and c) forces SPV wallets and perhaps other software to upgrade, which in and of itself is dangerous. 
But we're going to disagree on this, and that's okay. Thank you again for the civil discourse.

Hi I appreciate the post. I wish the discourse in the community rose more frequently to the level you've conveyed. I only have a few mins but will try to respond to a few of your main points:


Agreed 100%. The individual sovereignty over money is why Bitcoin (or any crypto technology) is so special. 


I disagree with this. While BTC1 doesn't include the replay protection that many people in this sub argue it should have, that doesn't mean it forces anything on anyone. Just like with ETH and ETC, any holder of coins pre-fork can split them and have coins on both chains after the fork. The user can then make individual decision about what to do with both. Sell one? Sell none? Sell both?  User still has full sovereignty. 
Adding replay protection would make it easier to split those coins (indeed, it would cause everyone's coins to split into two pieces), but it also makes the SegWit2x upgrade more likely to cause a lasting chain split. The SegWit2x goal is not to split the chain, but to bring key stakeholders together to agree on SegWit (already done now) and the 2MB block HF. After the HF, if it has the overwhelming support of miners and the major wallets that have indicated support thus far, Bitcoin can move ahead with a 2MB block and SegWit, which is what a huge portion of the community has wanted for 2+ years. Indeed, it what many Core members agreed to 2 years ago at the HK agreement, but which was never fulfilled.
And again, for those who don't want 2MB blocks, they can split their coins with the various tools that will enable users to do so, and will never have to touch the majority chain if they don't want to. 


is not "the community." It is one major part of the community. It is also, in my opinion, an incredibly hostile and venomous part of the community, one in which dissenting opinions have long since been pressured out, either through outright censorship or implicit social exile. Frankly, many Bitcoiners just don't come here anymore. 
But you're right that all users of Bitcoin deserve to be given the freedom to use the coin of their choice. So again, any of them may split the coins after the fork and stay with the 1MB chain if they wish. That is their right. 


I agree. But why do you think a world in which only Core decides what the protocol shall be is a world of choice? Personally, while I appreciate Core greatly and I am not one of those who wishes to "fire them," I also think a world of choice means that one group should not have monopoly control over the protocol. Putting SegWit2x to the market provides a choice, and if the market rejects it, then that's fine, and I will admit it failed, and I will continue building Bitcoin on whatever chain is dominate. Unlike some people, I won't quit just because things didn't go my way.


I don't abandon my agreements. I still think activating segwit by promising a 2MB HF was the right decision. I stand by it and will stand by the NYA and help carry it to completion. 
With that said, I have been waiting for 2+ years for Core to propose ANY hard fork block increase that they deem safe/reasonable. They have never done so. Despite many Core members claiming they are not opposed to bigger blocks, they have never proposed something to this effect. If they did, I'd be all ears, and even now my preference would strongly be that they simply merge the 2MB HF code and help the network upgrade as smoothly as possible. They won't though, so the vast majority of miners, and most of the biggest wallet providing companies, are moving on without them. 
After all, nobody controls Bitcoin. It is about individual sovereignty, not the power of any group to dictate the rules to the rest of us.
Again, thank you for the civil letter and discussion.
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:12:53
Some who opposed SegWit2x love to conveniently forget that it brought enough miners together (95%) to get SegWit activated after a year of stagnation.  It's fine to disagree on the merits of a 2MB base block, but claiming advocates of SegWit2x were trying to harm Bitcoin is absurd... as absurd as the nutty ones on that love to claim Blockstream is a sinister company controlled by Axa trying to kill Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:54:22
Actually 2x is about getting SegWit activated (which it accomplished) and increasing base block to 2mb to enable greater transaction throughout while Bitcoin grows.

That's cool, I like it! Now build consensus with miners and businesses to make it happen.  I'll very likely support it. 


So put forward a HF plan and build consensus around it, as most of the mining and business community has been asking, begging for, for 2+ years. I'll support you, but unfortunately there isn't really time left at this point. 


Some engineers agree with you. Some don't. Do you think that the only competent engineers are part of Core or support Core?  It's basically a self-selecting sample: If you agree with Core, you're deemed a worthy engineer on this subreddit. If you don't, then you aren't technically sophisticated and are called crazy or misguided or amateur. Many of the best engineers in this industry got so fed up with that phenomenon they actually moved to other coins and blockchains.
Look - you don't need to convince me that there are other paths forward. I'll support almost any plan that would help Bitcoin move beyond this quagmire. You need to convince miners, and businesses, and for too long Core and Core supporters have done little but insult their intentions, their talent, and their role in the ecosystem. What did you expect would happen?

You can't force a network change in Bitcoin. SegWit2x is a proposal, which is being offered to the market, and if the market likes it, then Bitcoin will move in that direction. 


SegWit2x. There's the name. I referred to it as "SegWit and a 2MB base block size" because that's what it is, and it can be helpful to discuss the nature of things instead of using politically-charged labels. 


I might suggest that it's the ones running around screaming "enemies of bitcoin!" that are causing political baggage. SegWit2x is simply an agreement among many significant stakeholders to support SegWit and a 2MB block upgrade. It can't be forced on anyone. If the market doesn't like it, then it won't be consequential.  If the market does, then Bitcoin will upgrade along that path. Let's stop attaching baggage and creating drama whenever people disagree on something. 


I promise the lost time and money of dealing with forks is substantially larger than any marginal revenue from some trading between those coins. What we profit from is a strong digital asset economy, which primarily means a strong Bitcoin, which is something I've been fighting for since 2011 and will continue to do so.


I will always attempt to influence Bitcoin in the way I think best. You may do the same. Neither of us have total control (nor should anyone, including Core). That's how decentralization works, and Bitcoin as a project is not helped by the constant vilification and hatred of those with whom you disagree. Those same evil "monolithic corporations" you so quickly dismiss have brought tens of millions of people to Bitcoin. What have you done?

SatoshiDice is using the blockchain exactly as it was intended... to transfer value (in big and small amounts) between two consenting parties anywhere in the world. It pays MORE than the minimum recommended fee on every transaction, and indeed most of the mining fees paid in Bitcoin's history were from SatoshiDice.
If SatoshiDice is a problem because it has caused Bitcoin to be used too much, then the whole experiment is a failure anyway. The system needs to be able to handle orders of magnitude more transactions than SD puts out, and the stress test provided by SD will encourage the developers to focus on this.
Further, SD donated over 400 BTC to the Foundation several weeks ago in order to help encourage development toward making the blockchain more efficient. 
Further, SD increased the minimum bets to .01 btc, so it's not like "dust" or spam transactions are even occurring at all. 
Frankly, SD has done more good for Bitcoin (by showing the power of this system, encouraging blockchain efficiency, paying more fees than anyone else, and donating far more than most people) than most of its detractors. 
And calling it a DDoS attack is just... wow. Imagine a DDoS attacker who actually pays the requested amount to use a service.

ShapeShift acquired KeepKey several months ago. We've been building the organization/staff/procedures/manufacturing, which takes some time. You should see increasing speed of updates and progress over 2018; ERC-20 tokens just went into the beta client last week, for example. 
And the reason for the larger size is intentional, but ultimately a personal preference. With the larger size, one can see full details about transactions on the screen itself. You can learn more at 
Frankly, Ledger, Trezor, and KeepKey are all fantastic devices and I recommend and use all of them.

Wallets don't need to upgrade in order to continue working now that SegWit is active.
Wallets *would* need to upgrade in order to continue working if SegWit2x added strong replay protection. 
So no, it is not hypocrisy.

Reminds me of Mike Hearn. The rest of us will keep building Bitcoin as we have been doing for years.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:36:13
And it wasn't accepted by even 50% of the miners. So... then what? 
To actually get SegWit activated (which, again, needs more stakeholders than just Core since Bitcoin is decentralized, after all) required reaching a compromise. That came together in the NYA, with SegWit and a 2MB base block. 
No things can move forward again.

Be careful listening to advice in this sub, it is full of propaganda. CoinBase formally stated what they will do after the fork: 
Simple and correct answer you're looking for: If you hold Bitcoin in CoinBase prior to the fork, you will have access to coins on both sides of the fork. CoinBase will give you coins on both chains, in other words. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:32:36
And was activated by NYA, after 2 years of failing to get even over 50% of miner support. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:18:39


That's absurd. What you mean is "the super majority of miners, the largest businesses with millions of users, and a large portion of the community will try to get a 2MB block instead of a 1MB block"
But that doesn't sound as sinister, does it, which is why you didn't word it like that. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:10:54
Please explain what is being "taken over"?  The reality: a bunch of companies and miners agreed to a compromise, to activate SegWit and a 2MB base block, in order to break the stalemate that has plagued Bitcoin for 3 years. After it happens, those parties will have no more "control" than they do today or than anyone else. 
Nobody controls Bitcoin. Not Core. Not miners. Not businesses. 
And saying I "disagree with the principle of decentralization" is utter nonsense. It's political rhetoric... easier to spout that shit than engage in meaningful discourse.

We believe we are acting in Bitcoin's best interest. But we realize many people at disagrees. Disagreement is fine, but questioning our dedication to the project is pretty lame. We were building this industry before 95% of the people on this sub had ever heard about cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-10-25 21:10:52


Abandoned is too strong a word (there can always be a tiny minority that keeps any chain alive). We would not call something Bitcoin if it didn't have overwhelming support as such, as measured by price/hashpower/users.  It is possible this will not be clear right after the fork, but we would not call the 2x chain Bitcoin unless it was clear.

@_date: 2017-09-18 02:00:22
I don't believe that "hash power = Bitcoin."  But it is in an important constituent piece... a piece that everyone on this sub also thought important until this debate caused them to dismiss the miners entirely, which is why SegWit didn't activate for 2+ years. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:44:13
Yeah.... well most of those same devs were unable to get SegWit activated and also supported larger block sizes eventually, so bitch and moan and spew hatred all you want, at least Bitcoin moved forward last summer.

No, I'm not the one advocating lawsuits. I'm pointing out that OP is threatening people with lawsuits, and is in the same post telling them financial advice which, if 2x becomes the dominate chain, will lose people literally billions of dollars. 
Nobody should be suing people over this nonsense. Bitcoin's community has split, and the market will figure out how to handle it.  
@_date: 2012-08-21 01:29:55

Anyone who would quit Bitcoin (ie like Mike Hearn) because the block was 2MB instead of 1MB is perhaps not in this project for the right reason. Core could (and I hope they do) merge the 2MB code and maintain all the control they have today. Why don't they do that? 94% of miners are signaling for it, and the business community has been asking for something like that for years. They ignore huge portions of the actual userbase of this technology.


We just disagree on this I'm afraid. The NYA broke an impasse that lasted for 2+ years. SegWit is active because we were willing to work with parties who disagreed with us, and find common ground. 
For a better understanding of why I supported it in the first place, please see this: 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:32:35
I'm peddling facts.  If the signalling changes, then facts will be different.

I didn't say that and we have no problem with atomic swaps. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:42:29
95% of miners are signalling for SegWit2x. What data are you basing your claim of them changing their position? And why would they activate SegWit and then not also activate the 2mb block (when it was the 2mb block they were more interested in in the first place)?
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:57:04
Yep, SegWit is good for everyone and we're proud supporters of it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:01:33


Please cite these polls. 
Frankly, neither of us know what "the community" wants because there is not a good way to learn that. mostly prefers 1x. mostly prefers BCH. 95% of Bitcoin users don't subscribe to either forum. Many of the biggest bitcoin companies, including all the biggest wallets, support 2x. ~94% of miners are indicating support of 2x.
The only way we'll know what the aggregate market truly wants is after November, and I think it's pretty disingenuous/unethical to advocate suing people who disagree on this topic before any party truly knows which side of the chain will win.
I would never, ever, advocate suing Core or any 1x supporters, despite the fact that I strongly disagree with them on this topic.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:09:16
Thanks, I hope Bitcoiners will be together fighting the real enemies again in the near future. This has been a dark period. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:23:25
Lol that is not why Core is against HF. They are generally against them because they see them as very dangerous/risky, and thus would only support them under certain circumstances.
Find me a Core dev who believes that if Core and the entire community moved forward with a HF block size increase, that suddenly they'd all be working on an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:37:30


Propose something with Core, and I'll be all ears, and eagerly interested in the plan. As I and the rest of the business community has been for 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:09:59
Sure. It's required at this time because it was promised to miners in order for them to agree to activate SegWit (the New York Agreement). I know some people here don't like "deals" for some reason, but I will make deals all day long if I think they will help move Bitcoin forward.
The miners activated SegWit as they promised, and now its encumbant on the parties to that agreement to fulfill the 2MB block obligation.
For more explanation of why I supported it in the first place: 
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:14:48

If anyone here is curious, the reason BitPay did this is due to the high fees and confirmation uncertainty that was ubiquitous in Nov-Jan period. When a payment failed (such as due to non confirmation), the refund payment might cost more in mining fees than the payment itself. Also, many payers didn’t know how to calculate the correct fee so their payment never went through in the first place. 
You can imagine the customer support nightmare when this is happening thousands of times a day. BitPay made the BIP70 mandatory in order to solve this issue.

@_date: 2018-02-23 15:10:31


Nonsense. 
The reality: I supported SegWit2x, which was a proposal to upgrade Bitcoin with SegWit (which worked as it got 95% of miners to finally support it), and a 2MB block (which didn't work because it didn't receive enough community support, and thus we dropped it). 
Leave the propaganda to the central bankers, it has no place here.

@_date: 2017-09-18 01:46:17
What the fuck happened to this sub.
Edit:  Okay here's a full response to the OP.  I realize that those in this sub disagree (vehemently), but those who advocate SegWit2x/NYA point to the fact (a fact, not a theory) that an overwhelming portion of hashpower is signaling for SegWit2x ( currently at 93%).  But miners aren't everything, of course. On top of that, all the biggest wallets in the world are ALSO signers of the NYA, and none have withdrawn support (CoinBase, Blockchain, Xapo, BitGo, and BitPay). There are dozens of other companies also granting explicit support. ShapeShift alone is 2-3% of all BTC transactions, and has supported SegWit2x from the beginning (read why:  To be sure, nobody really knows how many users support 1MB or 2MB blocks, but data would probably suggest that 90% or more of users don't even know this debate is going on, nor do they really care, so I don't really know what to do with that. We still have no good way to measure community sentiment.
If the hashpower and the biggest wallet providers stay the course, as they have indicated, then the hardfork in November will have overwhelming support. Unless you want to say "consensus" means "universal agreement," this SegWit2x upgrade will have consensus. (And nothing has "universal agreement" except the blockchain itself... because of the miners).
Several thousand angry subscribers do not dictate Bitcoin, but this sub has become such an echo-chamber, such a den of group-think that those here have utterly convinced themselves they represent "the community." There are many pieces of the community, and a huge portion is proceeding with the SegWit2x upgrade. To the extent it retains its current consensus and support, it will be the majority chain; the consensus chain, and the Core chain, which will be the tiny minority, will be the one that is breaking consensus. The Core chain has every right to break consensus if it wishes, for this is open source software after all, but that doesn't bestow some obligation on the vast majority to add code that protects the minority chain (which two-way replay protection would do).
I think it's unfair to say that an upgrade supported by ~95% of the miners is "breaking consensus."  That is twisting the definition to support political purposes.  Indeed, 95% was Core's own threshold for defining consensus in order to activate SegWit... which never even got over 50% support until the NYA finally broke the standoff and enabled SegWit to activate (and yes, I know UASF supporters think it was UASF). 
I blocked the OP on twitter because he was more interested in lobbing insults and twisting words than in talking. I've blocked less than 10 people of over 80,000 followers, so he joins a select few special ones.

Me too.  I would still greatly prefer if Core would put forward a 2MB (or any reasonable size) HF plan. They didn't do so after the HK agreement. They didn't do so a year ago. And they aren't doing so today. This inability to create social consensus has led already to one hard fork, and will lead to another in November.  Core's ability to perceive risks to the protocol is so myopic, they would sacrifice the cohesion of the entire network just to prevent a small marginal risk of node count reduction.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:07:11
Or just merge the 2MB code into Core and avoid nearly all the drama.
If Core did that, and added replay protection which I know many people here want, I would immediately support it.
It's not an attack on Bitcoin. It is a large portion of the community that has felt exiled and ignored by Core.... and Core could heal that rift.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:04:46
Upgrading Bitcoin's protocol without protection for the minority chain does not violate the non-aggression principle. It doesn't violate it if it was Core doing the upgrade, or if it was another party doing the upgrade. 
Anyone who holds BTC in their own keys will have coins on both chains, and with a little effort can split them and do whatever they wish. 


As I've said elsewhere, I'm not assuming which chain will win (largely because I don't have control over the miners - they're signaling ~94% in favor of NYA but as you know, they could change). The winner could certainly be the legacy chain. I'll hold both coins and will move forward with the winning chain as the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:21:00

@_date: 2017-10-11 18:49:55
Since calling Xapo a "scam/hidden attack" merely because they are letting the market decide which chain is the one true Bitcoin. 
Xapo, and Wences in particular, have done so much for this project.  This sub is spiraling down into madness. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:34:49
Defining as users is not quite sufficient, because they are not the only stakeholders. There are miners, and businesses, and engineers... all of which are very important. But ultimately, the point is to serve users, in order to provide a different monetary system to the world such that it may escape fiat (that's my goal, at least).
The big companies (CoinBase, Xapo, BitPay, Blockchain, etc) almost unanimously have been asking... begging... for bigger blocks for a few years. Why? Do you think it's because they just like seeing bigger blockchains and they don't care about potential adverse effects of propagation times? No. It's because they have literally millions of users, and they have witnessed firsthand the trend:  a worsening of customer experience on Bitcoin. Slower confirms, and higher fees (drastically higher than they used to be). Software products should get better with time, not worse. Bitcoin, as a payment system (you know, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system), has worsened. And while these companies realize you can't/should try to get all scale done on the block level, it is not unreasonable to want *some* increase in blocksize while other solutions continue to be engineered and rolled out. 
Yet, Core was unable to prepare and organize a HF to a larger block. They proposed SegWit instead, and then they were unable to rally consensus around it. Something needed to happen, and now it has. SegWit activated because SegWit2x and the NYA built consensus. And as part of that consensus, we (the signers) are working toward a 2MB block as well *because that's what enabled us to get SegWit.* And both SegWit and a 2MB block are good for Bitcoin, so why does this need to be so contentious?  But instead it's labelled a "corporate takeover" because some companies decided to take action and move the state of play forward. 
Do people realize that some Bitcoin transactions cost $5+ in fees alone? Do people realize that? And even if the portion that cost that much is small, do you realize what happens at scale?  If 1% of txs have a $5 fee, and you have a million customers, that is 10,000 people who are now emailing you, complaining about the cost of their transactions. Some of them might have sent a $10 payment, so half their money is now gone.
Explain that to several hundred customers day in and day out and you will start to understand the urgency that many businesses feel.  Now, this concern is not the only one we should listen to, but it is important, and it's completely foolish to vilify companies for trying to grow Bitcoin *so that more users can use it.*  For this, they are called enemies. It is fucking nuts.
And then discussion of new client software that raises the blocksize is called an "altcoin" and banned from this sub. What do you think is going to happen?
It's obviously a mess. If there is a way to mend the divide, I'm all ears. I've been trying to do it for a few years now, unsuccessfully.

Define "community" first. I see indications pointing in both directions. Miners point strongly to 2x. Futures point strongly to 1x. points strongly to 1x. points strongly to 2x. The biggest companies (with the vast majority of actual Bitcoin users) point strongly to 2x. Core devs point strongly to 1x. Devs that were exiled from Core point strongly to 2x. Devs at various companies point to both. And the gorilla in the room is that several million Bitcoin users don't even know about or understand this debate and just want Bitcoin that works well. 
So please define community. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:19:48
Correct... which means CoinBase, Xapo, and Gemini (as well as others who haven't formally announced the same) are simply letting the market decide "what is Bitcoin." And, they are following the Bitcoin whitepaper.

No I don't think that nor have I ever claimed it. SegWit2x appears to have overwhelming miner support, and substantial (but not necessarily majority) business and user support. Beyond those observations, I don't make further claims.

After the fork, with sufficient time to see where the dust settles, I'll happily move forward with whichever chain achieved greater market consensus and I will refer to that chain as the real Bitcoin. I hope it's clear quickly but I suppose it could take days/weeks.

If the market doesn't move ahead with SegWit2x chain then that's fine, and I'll concede that the market didn't like our suggestion. I am not the one trying to declare what the One True Bitcoin is. There are large factions of the community who disagree, SegWit2x has been proposed, and thus the market is going to settle it.

Whichever chain earns the majority of hashpower, users, transactions, and price. This could happen quickly, or take days/weeks even months perhaps. This could be the 1x chain, or the 2x chain, or if things get real crazy, it could still be the BCH chain.
Consensus will emerge following the fork, and once it is clear which chain consensus has formed around, that is the "real" Bitcoin, in my opinion. If only Core's chain can be the "real" Bitcoin, then we all have a much bigger problem on our hands and anyone who cares about decentralization should be very worried if that is the sentiment of this forum.

I'm not making the claim of which side will win. I'm saying that whichever side wins, that is Bitcoin. And advocating lawsuits against private parties who are simply following consensus is antithetical to Bitcoin's ethos, at minimum.   I would never advocate suing 1x supporters. They are free to claim their chain is the real Bitcoin. 2x supporters are free to claim their chain is the real Bitcoin. The truth will emerge from the consensus of the marketplace, following the fork.

1) To be accurate, BnkToTheFuture members are not investors in ShapeShift. They are investors in a BnkToTheFuture fund (which, in turn, is an investor in ShapeShift). 
2) If any investors in ShapeShift, or in the BnkToTheFuture fund, would like to sell their shares, I will personally pay 2x what they invested, no questions asked. Pls contact me directly if so.
3) SegWit2x isn't "rammed down anyone's throat." It is open source software. People can run it, or not. If anyone would like to know why I support it, I posted thoughts back in April which hold true today: 
EDIT: Responding to questions in the OP


1) It is not required at this point in time. With the activation of Segwit and upcoming Layer II solutions together with scaling optimizations over the next couple of years there is no need for a blocksize increase at this time. Far more critica for Bitcoin is to stay more decentralized, censorship resistant and lean in order to survive the ever increasing attacks and restrictions placed upon it by governments. An unneeded blocksize increase at this time threatens Bitcoin's ability to survive these challenges.
SegWit2x was organized to do two things: Activate SegWit, and activate a 2MB base block HF. SegWit was activated by the miners; they upheld their side of the deal. Now, it is up to us, the businesses and other signers of NYA, to support the planned HF to 2MB blocks in November. It was a package deal that many of us agreed to. Personally, I would not renege on a deal halfway through.  You say it's "not needed." Well, you're welcome to believe that, but in my opinion SegWit2x was needed to break the standoff. 


I understand this is very controversial. I can sympathize with arguments on all sides of it, frankly. Adding reply protection, however, helps the minority chain survive, and that itself may increase the "chaos in the Bitcoin ecosystem."  If 95% of miners follow through with the SegWit2x upgrade, and the largest wallets (CoinBase, Xapo, Blockchain, BitGo) do the same, then what will likely happen is simply Bitcoin will have 2MB blocks. Anyone who wants to break with that consensus and stick with the minority 1x chain, is free to do so, but the SegWit2x devs are not going to assist them in helping a minority chain. 


This is debatable. The major wallets all support SegWit2x. Users are hard to know... I think the honest answer is that nobody really knows what "the community wants" until the fork happens and the market is allowed to act. SegWit2x might fail in the market, or it might succeed. Whichever chain becomes the clear winner, I will call it Bitcoin, even if it's not the chain I would've preferred. 


As a supporter of SegWit2x, my goal is not at all to replace any developers. My goal is to get miners to activate SegWit, which was successful, and then to activate a 2MB hardfork, such that Bitcoin will have twice the capacity for transactions while layer 2 solutions continue to be built. And indeed, the Core devs can't be "replaced."  They can choose to leave, or they can choose to merge the 2MB code and follow majority consensus. That's up to them as individuals.


The rationale was in part to avoid forks, yes, but was primarily an attempt to a) activate SegWit and b) upgrade to a 2MB blocksize for additional on chain capacity. ~94% of miners continue to signal for it, so unless that changes, the agreement stands. It does suck that ViaBTC broke its agreement, and went ahead to create BCH. I think they betrayed the agreement, clearly, but they are a minority.


I don't withdraw from agreements that I make. And people - users, businesses, miners, devs, and markets will always determine the future of Bitcoin. My hope, and indeed I could be wrong, is that the HF happens, has overwhelming miner, business, and market support, and people can get back to work building Bitcoin, now having the benefits of a 2MB block, and SegWit, with which Bitcoin will be superior to the Bitcoin that existed prior to the NYA. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:00:17
First, I like your username.
Second, I appreciate the thoughtful reply.


Call it an educated guess. To date, I have met or spoken with only a handful who think blocks should never be bigger. One of them is Luke-jr.  Poll the Core devs, you will find most of them support larger blocks (via a HF) in one way or another. I don't think is even in dispute, is it? The dispute is over when, how, and to what extent (all perfectly valid things to debate).


Disagree. The SegWit2x supporters are not trying to create a new coin. If SegWit2x fails to gain clear majority, it will (and should) be abandoned, and the 1x chain would remain as Bitcoin. If that happens, then clearly the market rejected 2x, and that's okay. I will respect the market's decision. To those of us who do not want to create a new coin (basically every 2x supporter), adding the strong replay protection is antithetical to that goal, as it ensures a perpetual chain split.  


This is debatable. All sides in this share responsibility for getting to this point. Do people really think that exiling, censoring, and vilifying huge portions of the community would lead to anything other than contentious stand offs? Any discussion of larger blocks or different clients was labeled an "altcoin" and explicitly banned from WTH did people think would happen? For all the talk of "we can never fork because it's risky," there is an astounding inability to perceive the risk to Bitcoin of perpetually ostracizing large constituencies, which include the miners (immensely important to Bitcoin) and the largest companies (also immensely important to Bitcoin). 
All of this - every single Bitcoin fork of these past few months (and the threats of them prior) - would've been avoided if Core organized and put forward a plan for a responsible hard fork... they could've done it two years ago. Users of this technology do not wait forever. They try to improve it, or they move to other crypto platforms. 


I think most of the people fighting agree on 99% of the same stuff, which makes this whole opera so tragic. Instead of recognizing legitimate disagreement, the tendency has been censorship and vilification. Everyone who supports SegWit2x is an "enemy of Bitcoin" and war propaganda is spewed in every thread. The character of individuals is continually attacked, and their intentions assumed to be evil. And the same disgusting behavior is rampant in as well, but targeting Blockstream instead. 
Frankly, nearly everyone is at fault at some level (myself included), and at this point everyone has lost the debate, and the resulting fracturing of the community (and forks, which are just the manifestation of that) is inevitable. Only the market will resolve it with time, and I'm perfectly happy for the market to do so. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:51:54
Bro, S2X WILL be Bitcoin if it earns super majority of miner/business/user/economic power. 
You can argue about whether it will achieve that or not. And you can argue about the merits or problems of S2X. But you can't claim that a legacy, minority chain is Bitcoin if a vast majority of consensus moves away from it. 
And if S2X wins, then if Coinbase passed off the 1x coins as Bitcoin, they'd similarly open themselves up for lawsuits. Have you read the whitepaper? The longest chain (most proof of work) is Bitcoin.

In this case, I'm talking about a majority of hashpower, price, and users. If 2x earns that, then it is just an upgrade of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-25 23:42:03
Yeah we will split coins before we send them out of course. And yes, replay issues will cause problems for some customers, we will try to help and communicate as best we can. 
You know what also causes problems for some customers? $5 fees and multi-day confirmation delays. Fortunately, SegWit and a 2MB block will greatly help with that, so that Bitcoin can be more competitive again... which is the entire point of this initiative.

Not sure where I ever made such a claim, nor a demand of any kind. And Core, whether they are a group of known people (the truth) or a "process" only (nonsense), do not control Bitcoin (or at least, should not). Nobody should control Bitcoin.
So when large portions of the community ask repeatedly for something (because, perhaps, they have millions of users and they see how Bitcoin is actually being used by real people), and Core + Core supporters reject/censor/exile/vilify them repeatedly, you may find they organize elsewhere.

It's not a new coin. It is Bitcoin with a 2MB block instead of a 1MB block. And if the majority of stakeholders consider it the "real" Bitcoin, instead of the 1MB legacy chain, then it is indeed Bitcoin.
The market declares what Bitcoin is, not any individual or group of people. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:12:11
Well, you're making assumptions now. If miners do what they are currently signaling, then Bitcoin moves ahead with the SegWit2x chain, and the legacy chain will only have ~5-10% of hashpower, meaning it will be nearly unusable for actual transactions for several months.
If the biggest wallet companies (with millions of users) and the mining power goes with the SegWit2x side, why do you assume the legacy chain will have a higher price?  It's certainly possible, but not likely. 
ShapeShift as a company (and myself personally) have endorsed SegWit2x. If the legacy chain has significant market support after the fork, then ShapeShift will let people trade both versions of Bitcoin (just as ShapeShift lets people trade BCH right now).

CEO here - some people in this sub hate us (and me) because we have been advocating for SegWit and a 2MB base block size... and many of these people started hating simply because we are an exchange for many different digital assets instead of Bitcoin only. 
Regardless of the haters, we serve hundreds of thousands of happy customers. We are 3% of all Bitcoin transactions. We've built a service that brings liquidity to all digital assets, and have done so in a way that removes custody of funds and the warehousing of personal information. Personally, I've been advocating and fighting for Bitcoin for over 6 years, when most of the haters here were still making fun of it, if they'd heard of it at all.
You'll find the most successful crypto companies tend to be vilified in this sub. CoinBase, Bitpay, and Blockchain.info, which have probably done more for Bitcoin adoption than all other crypto companies combined, are good examples.

Euro and dollar are identical in their attributes. The only reason they both exist is because of government coercion requiring one to be used in Territory A and the other to be used in Territory B. Without legal tender laws or the requirement to pay taxes in a specific fiat currency, there would be no reason to use fiat whatsoever, and it would be out-competed by other monies in the marketplace. The US dollar would out-compete the euro, and then the dollar itself would fall to competition from non-fiat assets that had better competitive attributes.

I'm the same person... don't you find it strange that many of the original bitcoiners from 2011 era are supportive of SegWit2x? Something has changed, for sure, but it isn't me. I've been advocating practical solutions for scaling for at least three years. I've always supported SegWit, and I've always supported a modest increase in the blocksize. But I'm not going to get caught up in the witch hunts and vilification that so many in this sub perpetuate. 
There is a strong "anti company" sentiment, which is really foolish if you want Bitcoin to take over the world. If you just want it to remain an interesting tech project, then perhaps that makes sense. I'm in this to change global finance, and anyone who wants to help Bitcoin grow is, in my opinion, an ally, even if I disagree on certain specific points.

Banks would be happy to offer domestic transfers to Bitcoin exchanges in a free market. The reason they are so hesitant is because of the threat of government punishment upon them for "enabling money laundering and financing terrorists."
It is true the BitLicence will make them more comfortable with Bitcoin, but only because it reduces the legal uncertainty around it. You could also remove the legal uncertainty if the gov just said "free citizens have the right to transact with each other and we won't fuck with them." 
BitLicense is thus, at best, a superficial cure for a  fundamental disease created by the same organization.

In a disagreement, both sides are guilty of making it contentious, by definition. The NYA proposed something that most Bitcoiners want: SegWit and a larger block.  Most Core devs want a larger block. Some of them committed to doing it long ago, and yet it didn't happen, and they were unable to build consensus to make SegWit activate.
So we took it into our own hands. SegWit2x was proposed as a path forward. It successfully activated SegWit (though some here conveniently forget or ignore that), and if the market ultimately doesn't want a 2MB block, then the SegWit2x upgrade will be rejected, and that's fine. It is up to the market, but many of us are not going to sit around and let Bitcoin languish for years to stagnation.
You're welcome to disagree with the method, but we have more important battles to fight.  Core could easily end this feud by either merging 2MB themselves (which I would like), or organizing and committing to a larger block HF timeframe (which they continue refusing to do).  
This is open source, decentralized software. Anyone, or any group, is free to propose changes and the market will decide.

The purpose isn't to "embrace alts."  The purpose is to enable digital assets to be more useful in aggregate. Most alts are lame, agreed. Yet, some are innovative and unique, and provide valuable services. ShapeShift doesn't try to pick and choose, we just listen to the market, and when the market is paying attention to a specific digital asset, we pick it up and make that asset more liquid with all the others on our platform. This is good not only for the asset in question, but for every other asset (including Bitcoin) which now has another good for which it can be traded effortlessly.

You're referring to Segwit2x, which was a proposal to upgrade Bitcoin with SegWit (accomplished) and a 2MB base block (which didn't gain enough support and was thus dropped). 
Calling it an "attack" is nonsense propaganda and is not helping Bitcoin.

Tether is a cryptocurrency that is backed by USD. Basically, the Tether company holds dollars in a bank account, and releases Tether coins. Each coin is worth $1 exactly, because of the promise of Tether to redeem and distribute them at exactly that rate. (Yes, you are trusting Tether to be honest - using Tether means assuming counterparty risk, it's thus different than using a pure cryptocoin that doesn't have backing)
Asset exchange here refers to ShapeShift which is a platform for converting (exchanging) digital assets. With ShapeShift, you can convert Tether into other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dash, Dogecoin, etc. without an account or signup 
TL;DR - it's super easy to move between cryptocurrencies including Tether now.

This means you are protected from price volatility, but can live in cryptoworld and pay any Bitcoin merchant or Bitpay invoice, etc.

It is not an attack. Continuing to mischaracterize it, and the people and intentions involved, is why the drama continues. 
We are Bitcoiners. Most of us here long before this sub went to shit from censorship, and long before the block size debate even started. We think Bitcoin is better with both SegWit and a larger block, so we made a proposal and put it to the market. 
You don't have to agree with us, but stop lying about our intentions and goals. SegWit2x is not an attack. It is a proposal from a group of Bitcoiners who disagree with the monoculture narrative of this sub. And it is also what already activated SegWit, after this sub was unable to build consensus (largely because it kept vilifying miners and businesses).

It's an agreement made among many bitcoin companies and miners, to reach compromise such that both SegWit and a 2MB HF will be activated. 
Proof it is not a takeover:  Core could merge the 2MB HF code and instantly retain all "control" over the Bitcoin software. 
Opponents frame it as a "takeover" because that sounds scary and is a slimy rhetorical trick, as opposed to discussing the merits or problems of a given path.

Consider that even if user gets all the income from the mining, 21's pool still benefits from larger hashpower (smooths out volatility in block discovery, which in and of itself is valuable).

I'd prefer lower price and freedom to higher price and tyranny. 
Edit: A more thoughtful response is that any increase in price caused by enactment of legislation is but the mirror of a lower price caused by market participants scared of what regulations may come about. In other words, governments scare people from using Bitcoin because nobody is quite sure how legal it is, or how legal it will be, and then when legislation is finally passed that uncertainty - created in the first place by ominous government overhang - is reduced and the price may rise. This is not a benefit of regulation, but a trick upon those who didn't perceive the damage already done by the coercive threats placed against the industry from the outset.

1) It's free open source software. Don't use it if you don't like it.

I used to share that sentiment, but over time I realized that different digital assets could in fact possess fundamentally different attributes, and can often be used in tandem with bitcoin in important ways. For example, use Dash + Bitcoin for more privacy, or use Tether + Bitcoin for more stability. Hell, even Dogecoin + Bitcoin for more fun.  Also, some digital assets aren't really intended as a "currency" (BitShares or Storj for example). But to the extent people own them, why not enable them to be immediately convertible into goods on Amazon?
Coins that do nothing unique will likely fall to zero and be forgotten. Most altcoins fit into this category. But those that have unique attributes are worth consideration and will find uses.  And for all the digital assets that exist and are in use, they ought to be immediately liquid/convertable between each other. Thus ShapeShift.
FYI - for those who don't know, "Dash" is the new brand name of Darkcoin.

Ummmm that's a false choice. If the Gov. runs up against the debt ceiling it has two choices, 1) spend less or 2) default on debts. You're suggesting it only has option  Obviously  shouldn't be done. But  could be done... except nobody in Gov wants to do it.  The Debt Ceiling was supposed to force this choice to happen if spending gets out of control, but if it's simply raised every time, then there is no check on spending except the fateful day when US Gov bonds collapse because people realize the debt is completely unpayable. 
With this understanding, anyone who votes to raise the debt ceiling  again and again and again is acting incredibly irresponsibly. 
The debt ceiling has never not been raised... the whole thing is a farce. If they were honest they'd just remove the ceiling altogether.

If BTC ever reaches widespread adoption/usage, the price per coin will have to be far higher than today.

The system is very flexible in that way.

I'd be happy to. BTC is held in Mycelium wallet. When you want to Lock $100 worth, that much BTC is sent to Coinapult, who sells the coins and then holds $100 of USD fiat on your behalf. You now have $100 worth of stable USD value on your phone. A day or year later, you can unLock, and then the $100 is converted back to BTC and spent or sent, etc. 
The benefit is that anyone can now hold stable fiat currency on their phone, no bank account or bank approval needed. No paperwork. No jurisdictional issues. Consider the average person in Venezula, who can now escape inflation and the entire Venezuelan banking system. 
Critics will point out that with Locks you are trusting Coinapult. Yes, true. Locks is not trying to solve the problem of custodianship or trustlessness. It is trying to solve the problem of volatility. It is not a panacea, but a useful tool for a specific and widespread need. An automobile does not solve the problem of hunger, nor does a cheeseburger solve the problem of transportation. Bitcoin is enabling an ecosystem of useful financial tools, Locks being but one.

No, it's not "absolutely ridiculous." Ponder for a moment that PonderCoin is released tomorrow. It has different features than Bitcoin, and there will be 500,000,000 of them, released on a different schedule than Bitcoin. The rule is, they can never be priced according to a currency. On the very first trade for a loaf of bread... the owner of the loaf will immediately think "okay, this bread cost me $3, how many PonderCoins do I want for it" and BAM suddenly a USD &lt;-&gt; PonderCoin exchange rate has been established. 
Bitcoin doesn't need the USD to operate, but without ANY pricing references to other currencies, it will be difficult/impossible to ascertain an early price for a Bitcoin. I believe actually it is impossible NOT to relate Bitcoin to other currencies, because all trades in an economy are based on relative prices between various goods and commodities, as measured by the common medium of exchange (money). 
Bitcoin is superior to the USD, but still USD is much more stable right now and more trusted. So, quite naturally, that's how the first Bitcoin prices will evolve. Nothing wrong with that.

I call it like I see it. Bernie believes individuals who don't have a permission slip from the US government shouldn't be allowed to come into the US and work. He's a xenophobe, and an economic illiterate, much like Donald Trump (another bad person). Those who use coercion upon others, knowingly and willingly, are bad people... Bernie carries the trait in spades.

What's the difference between your friend who has a website with a banner ad that is there constantly in front of everyone, and your friend with an occasional sponsored tweet? At least in the case of the latter, the friend has much more control over what is tweeted, and when, than he has with the banner. Twitter enables people to see ads that are more targeted to them- this is both more efficient and moves AWAY from spam, which all of us hate.

Without a trade in and out of a more stable currency (USD), it will be difficult/impossible for Bitcoiners to determine appropriate pricing for goods and service bought with Bitcoin.  
Assume no trades for USD ever occured, so there was no dollar price for Bitcoins. What would a haircut cost in Bitcoin? How much should one pay for web hosting in Bitcoin? Without a frame of reference, Bitcoin cannot develop its own price very well.
Now, long term, people will start thinking more in terms of Bitcoin price, instead of dollar price. But this takes time. It takes time for the Bitcoin "value" to become understood well, and simply trying to prematurely disconnect it from exchange with USD is silly.
The MORE trade in and our of dollars, the better. The extent to which Bitcoin value can purchase other things, whether dollars or haircuts, is the extent to which it'll succeed.

It's done a little differently I believe. BitShares are used to back BitUSD, but Bitshares themselves are volatile (ie - not pegged to USD). So this means they have a larger pool of Bitshares to do the backing, and so long as the entire value of that pool is greater than the USD value of all the BitUSD, then the backing is legitimate. But, if the market dumped Bitshares, then BitUSD's backing would be in jeopardy.  Tether is in this way more safe, but at the same time requires trust in the Tether company. 
@_date: 2011-12-02 01:13:13
Yes you're right about that. BTC is far superior to USD, and those of us who know this superiority are actually "cashing out" of USD into the better currency, BTC. But, still, an exchange rate between the two must be established and a free market will always determine one.

Perhaps you haven't yet heard of Civil Asset Forfeiture. Which is even worse that this. Throughout the US, law enforcement agencies will confiscate property (cars, money, etc) from people based on "suspicion of a crime." The person doesn't even need to be formally charged. To get the property back, the person must PROVE that the property was not involved in a crime (and of course doing this requires months/years and many thousands in costs). New Mexico just banned this practice, thankfully.  More info:

Films that end up on Netflix, or iTunes, or cable, or Vudu, or airplanes, or many other professional channels get there because of the role of a publisher who negotiates a deal to get that content distributed through that channel. If the bitcoin documentary was just released for free by the producers, they would not have landed a publishing deal, and the film would not go through many of the top distribution channels.  This doesn't mean a movie can't be successful without a publisher, but people need to understand there is a reason movies go the traditional route, and specifically among the Bitcoin community, people should realize the value that has come from the producers' decision to go this route. Business executives flying on Lufthansa are now watching the documentary... and they likely would not have been exposed to it if it wasn't put in front of them via a channel they come across in their normal behavior.

That is not what I'm saying. Miners follow price/marketcap, meaning that miners follow the market, which mean miners follow the community weighted by wealth.

If people retweeted a sponsored message from the Red Cross to help gather funds for a charity drive, would that be "terrible" and an "exploitation of people's trust?"  What if someone had video footage of police abuse and was trying to get his message out to the world?

Maybe someone believes in a cause, and is willing to put her own money toward informing others about it. This site lets anyone, in any country, have that ability.

Nobody owes income tax, morally speaking. But if you don't pay, men with guns will steal your property and may throw you in a cage if you resist that theft. The reason to pay taxes is not because they are "owed," any more than the shop owner owes the mafia offering him protection, but rather because one is under duress, and is being extorted.

My one recommendation is that people should keep the discourse more professional and reduce the personal attacks and the hyperbole.

Lol nowhere close to that. But still, I gain much more by Bitcoin being strong than by anything else. ShapeShift also gains much more by Bitcoin being strong, our volume growth corresponds with the rising Bitcoin price. Alts and BTC are not mutually exclusive, they are complimentary assets.

Remember that real interest rates are already negative on cash at banks.

This whole "protocol development can't compromise" meme is bullshit. Many pieces of the protocol are a compromise. 
Is a block every 10 minutes an "objectively perfect interval?" No. It's a compromise between longer times and shorter times. 
Is 1MB the "objectively perfect block size? No, it's an arbitrary number Satoshi picked, and is a trade off between larger blocks which have higher latency (but more throughput) and smaller blocks with less latency (but less throughput). 
There are probably more secure hash functions. Why aren't they used? Because a tradeoff needed to be made with security and computational difficulty. 
Is every feature in Bitcoind needed? No. A tradeoff was made between usability and feature-bloat. 
People who imagine any engineering project to be "mathematically perfect" and immune from tradeoffs - "horse-trading" as OP derogatorily refers to it - are deceiving themselves and doing no favors to the project itself.

Some coins have different attributes than Bitcoin (ie privacy in Monero or stability in Nubits). Some have more complex features, such as the asset exchange built into NXT. Some are not meant to be currencies at all, such as various Counterparty assets. Some are pure experimentation  (such as proof of stake or other mining mechanisms). And some are just pump and dumps :)  The important point is that not every altcoin competes with Bitcoin, some are good compliments (like bitcoin and ethereum). The vast array of different projects is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, though one should expect most to eventually perish.

I think I do know exactly how it works. 
I've read through the entire BitLicense application, have you? None of its 45 pages of requirements would've prevented the thefts (not a single mention of multisig or HD wallets or 2-factor anywhere in the application or regulations - it's just a fishing expedition for useless information). However, they would've required personal private customer information to be collected and warehoused that would now be stolen and leaked online. 
Do you not see the hacks that happen to companies of every shape and size, in every regulated market? Hell, the US Federal Government itself can't even keep records safe. Don't tell me that getting a Ben Lawsky permission slip makes anything more technically secure. If you think that a small division in the New York Department of Financial Services knows more about securing crypto and keeping customers safe than the actual businesses who live and breath it every day, you are delusional. 
For the record, here is the application: 
Edit: a shortlist of some high profile hacks just last year. Note how many are in "regulated and licensed" industries.  
It is time to stop honeypotting private sensitive information of users who just want to do business as private individuals in a free country.

My tweet: 
My opinion: Running a full node is great. The more the better. HOWEVER, if Bitcoin is actually going to become the foundation of a global financial system (which is what I thought this whole thing was about?), then it needs to be built with the expectation that most users won't run a full node... they won't know what that is, they won't care how it works, etc. 
Already over 99% of Bitcoin users don't run full nodes. That is fine and expected... it is a sign that Bitcoin is being used by normal people, not hobbyists.

Don't ever cross a border with a laptop that isn't hard-drive encrypted, and remove your mail accounts from your phone/tablets.

I don't disagree with that. However, I worry that sometimes such people forget that technical considerations, while very important, are not the only considerations. A technically advanced system which nobody finds useful is less valuable than a less advanced system which people use. Coders often like to think in black and white, but then forget an entire realm of variables, which are the human users of the product. 
I've tried to consider and appreciate all the good arguments from all sides of the issue. I don't dismiss Core, and I don't dismiss those who disagree with some of their prioritizations. Ultimately, Bitcoin is not merely a technical machine, but a social experiment, and if the technical machine underlying it veers too far from the usefulness of its social features (namely widespread digital decentralized money, to start), then the machine will start falling apart.
Another way to think of it is that the Bitcoin technical machine has, as one of its components, a social contraption. The best engineers must understand the social contraption as an element of the machine, and sometimes pure coders do not appreciate this. Ultimately, all of this is hard and experimental, and this is why people who care about the project should, at all times, be patient and kind to each other while we all figure it out.

If the question is, "why is bitcoin better than fiat money," the answer is that it cannot be debased, nor controlled by any person or privileged group of people. It is money that derives its price from the market (voluntary exchange) instead of by coercion and force. Thus, it is both a better store of wealth, and also more ethical, transparent, and honest.
If your question is, "why is bitcoin a better payment system?"  The answer is that it often is not, at least for most people, most of the time. Eventually it will be the best payment system, but it needs to develop further, gain more adoption, and get over the scaling obstacles. Even so, Bitcoin is already the best payment system for certain use-cases, such as sending money across borders, or receiving money from someone you don't trust (which helps further in cross-border transactions).
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:31:02
Nobody knows what prices will do tomorrow. Do not buy Bitcoin unless you understand what it is, what it does, why it's valuable, and why it will be even more valuable in the future. If you're buying it without understanding those things, then you're just gambling. But gambling can be fun, too ;)

"Basically, everyone’s risks go down with more people running BIP148 nodes. "
True of any Hard Fork scenario also... risk goes down the more people agree to do it. I don't quite understand how this UASF initiative is any safer than a well-planned HF. Actually, the only way this seems different than a normal HF is that the majority chain, if I'm reading this correctly, can actually get replaced by a minority chain. That sounds preposterously dangerous.

If a central bank created a cryptocurrency that they themselves couldn't manipulate (no arbitrary inflation or account closure/siezure) then it might be just as good as Bitcoin, and who cares which won?

This is narrow-minded thinking. If BTC price is suppressed because of the scaling conflict (which I promise it is), then high fees in blocks doesn't necessarily surpass losses from mining reward due to price suppression. 
It would be extremely short-sighted and foolish to block progress which enables Bitcoin to scale and become worth $10k+ per coin merely to get marginally more mining fees. And if you invest $100mm in mining hardware, you aren't short-sighted.
Miners are not "winning." While the impasse exists, everyone in Bitcoin is losing. Banks are winning.

Everyone is motivated by profit, ideals, ego, altruism, and social influence. 
My point remains... why is "5 individuals" (3 of whom work for one company) more decentralized than "4 companies". 
Companies are managed by boards and shareholders (and customers to some degree)... seems far more decentralized to put default nodes in the hands of four companies than five individuals.  
Regardless, I think they should've just left the five individuals' nodes in there also.

thank you for a reasonable and well-written post. It's a breath of fresh air.  
Regarding the "1.14.1" issue... honestly I don't have a strong opinion on that. Maybe you're right and they should've numbered it differently.  I don't think, however, that one should just assume a "coup" because of disagreements like that. There is a disturbing trend in this community: If you agree with Core, then great. If you don't, then Core and/or Core supporters will say, "then go fork off and do it yourself!".  And then if you do, in fact, fork off and do it yourself, you get lampooned at every turn. It's called a "coup" and all sorts of inflammatory language is used to discredit and demean you. This is more appropriate for cult or tribal worship, not an open source engineering community trying to build one of the most important technological inventions of the 21st century.
Regarding the hard fork being "stupidly fast." It's reasonable to disagree on what a "safe" timeline is (but of course nobody will agree on this). But if that urgency seems misplaced to you, consider that if Core had listened to the vast majority of users, miners, and businesses in this industry they had AMPLE opportunity to help encourage a responsible, conservative plan for a HF to a larger block size. Instead, they've refused, demanding that SegWit be activated instead and that "maybe sometime in the future a HF will be done." Nobody believes that Core has any intention of ever engaging a HF. I have been warning about this for two years... the only outcome of that obstinance and unwillingness to listen to market participants is that a hardfork happens without Core, since Core has been unwilling to help organize it. A hardfork without Core's support is more dangerous and risky, I agree. However, given the various ways it could unfold, SegWit2x is a much safer alternative than the perpetual risk of a contentious HF carried out unilaterally (and perhaps by surprise) by the miners. SegWit2x is also safer than the status quo, in which Bitcoin has stagnated and other blockchains are rapidly gaining dominance.
Should it be 6 months instead of 3? Perhaps. But Core still wouldn't support it. They will demand at minimum 12-18 months, and frankly I think that's ridiculous. But you know what? If Core came out and said, "We'll help support SegWit2x if the HF is moved to 12 months so we can do it safely" I would support them and I would advocate for that. But they won't do it. They won't commit to any HF any time in the future. Thus the miners and the industry and the users endure increasing pressure to "go it alone" with all the good and bad that can entail. Who is the one being reckless... the industry which is finally taking matters into its own hands, bringing the support of the miners along, and making SegWit AND a 2MB HF happen? Or is it Core who has been utterly unwilling to compromise on the fact that a huge portion of the industry and users want a larger blocksize. More comments on blocksize here: 
Bitcoin, as a technology, cannot afford to sit around and argue about this for another two years. It has dropped in market share from 95% to less than 50% of the cryptocurrency market cap. Frankly, if it does not move past this scaling debate this summer (either via SegWit2x or a successful UASF), I think Ethereum will replace it as the dominant blockchain in the world. I don't want that to happen. I want SegWit. I want a larger blocksize. And I want the Bitcoin community to move past this quagmire of the past two years. SegWit2x has overwhelming industry support, and overwhelming miner support. In my judgement, it is the best chance of meeting these three goals.

The fees are not very high if you do full calculus of depth and rates at traditional markets. Fees sometimes appear high due to illiquid markets, but it isn't a fee. As a general tip, if rate is important to you, always do "specific amount" transaction with ShapeShift. When we know how much you intend to buy, we can provide the tightest spread and thus the best rate.

Hey devs, this is very cool. We'd love to start recommending this to ShapeShift's customers when they ask for wallet recs. How open would you be to integrating ShapeShift's  exchange API into the app? (so user can, for example, convert his BitCrystals on the phone to Gemz, or Bitcoin).

ShapeShift CEO here. First of all, I'm happy to see articles like this which scrutinize new services. This is healthy. $500 has been donated to the author.
I'll respond to the key points of the article...


ShapeShift is not a counterparty to the Prism, in the normal sense of a "custodial counterparty."  ShapeShift is not holding the user's funds, and doesn't have the keys to take the funds. Only the user's ETH key can withdraw the capital in the Prism that is owed to the user.  CAVEAT: During private beta, there is an escape hatch in the contract which ShapeShift does control. The production version of Prism (post beta) will enable users to opt-out of that escape hatch. Presence of an escape hatch, especially in early versions of the code, is one of the lessons learned from the DAO disaster.
Now, it is true that trust in the oracle is somewhat required, but the oracle isn't a "counterparty" or "custodian" either (though perhaps this is a debate about definitions). The oracle feeds in price information, and that price information has an auditable trail that is recorded in the blockchain. Thus, if ShapeShift tampered with its own oracle prices, it would be discoverable. 
The plan has always been that Prism will support multiple oracles (from different providers) as this industry developers. Right now, nobody provides a price feed oracle for the assets on Prism, so we had to build one ourselves. We fully expect Oracles to become a robust market service, and future Prism users can choose from various Oracles. 


And not a single dollar of customer funds were lost. We are the first and only exchange to accomplish that.


Technically it's 2x, and I will explain why.  Prisms are fully collateralized. For the Prism to gain over 100% and still be collateralized, more capital is needed. Prism will have that feature in the future, but doesn't right now. There's nothing intrinsic in Prism that prevents greater than 2x gains, we just don't have it yet. 
To summarize, the point is that with Prism, trust is placed in objective, open-source, decentralized code instead of in subjective people or organizations.  This is similar to Bitcoin:  It is "trustless" in that trust is moved from trusting humans (subjective) to trusting open source code (objective). Prism, if we've built it correctly, can be as trustless as Bitcoin, though it is providing a different type of service and has different dynamics.
Things we still need to do before Prism is fully trustless to the potential of its design:  enable 3rd-party open source oracles, and enable users to opt-out of the escape hatch.  For now, please remember that Prism is still in Private Beta.

Rootstock looks awesome, but it's not real yet, and requires non-trivial changes in Bitcoin. And remember that work done in some altcoins has helped inform projects like Rootstock. These experiments all build on each other. 
You say, "most will perish, yet they represent a healthy system?"

It's really not condescending. Hobbyists and bitcoin companies are the likeliest to run full nodes, and I bet at least 90% of full nodes out there are owned by someone in one of those two categories. I consider myself a hobbyist, and run my own nodes, as does my business. It's absurd to think an average bitcoiner would run a full node... indeed the reality today proves my point. There are several thousand nodes, and millions of users.  
"Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver, Erik Voorhees, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright all want you to unplug your full node. They want you to trust them."  &lt;--- THAT is condescending, drama-filled, and adolescent.

I used to think this way... but I came to realize A) it's not technically feasible (nor even desirable) for everything to be built on one chain and B) there is value in the competition and experimentation between chains. It helps to realize that not every chain will be built as a pure "money" chain - there may be features of a blockchain that make it ideal for money (like bitcoin) but not ideal for other uses. So long as all the systems are interoperable (one reason I built ShapeShift), free, and open, I see little harm in the broad experimentation going on. Caveat: a significant number of altcoin projects are useless, so be careful and discerning.

A bank database will always be mutable, because they will always require the ability to reverse, change, or block a transaction (due to their own policies or government).

Excellent piece... "The breakthrough technology is the distributed public ledger that’s not owned by anyone and can be used by anyone. While blockchain experiments by banks could lead to more efficient processes and cost savings, the blockchain that will have the biggest impact on the world by many orders of magnitude will be the blockchain that anyone can use. These blockchain experiments are likely to serve as a Bayesian updating mechanism for banks and will help them understand the power of a global public ledger faster than they otherwise would have."

But the electricity is private property of the person burning it. The miner pays the economic price to buy electricity, and has decided that mining is an effective use of that resource (which is his alone). Any private party who believes mining is a waste of electricity will not do it.   
Your concern of "planetary waste" assumes there is some fininte amount of electricity, which belongs to humanity, and by using it we are dwindling that precious resource. In reality, electricity is produced and exchanged - it is a supremely renewable resource which exists in such beautiful abundance precisely because humanity finds all kinds of incredible uses for it, and so goes about making it.

The 100% max profit simply means that if the Prism portfolio appreciated beyond 100% gain, it wouldn't be fully collateralized. It would then require that the user "trust" ShapeShift to increase the collateral. To avoid that requirement of trust, we simply close the Prism upon reaching 100% gain.  If you're still bullish on the Prism portfolio, you could then just open a new one.
The above isn't ideal, but is how Prism works during the beta period. Longer term, we will enable a single Prism to appreciate without limit.

The answer is not a mystery. It's because SegWit2x promised a 2MB hardfork, which is what the miners wanted.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:38:49


There have been some, yes. SegWit has been one of the most important, and yet Core has been unable to get it passed, because they refuse to take into consideration the perspectives of the business community, and the miners. I am not at all one of those who wants to "fire core"... but I have more allegiance to Bitcoin than I do to Core's feelings and Bitcoin needs to move forward. SegWit2x has finally provided a plausible chance of that. Yet this sub has done nothing but shit on it and vilify the people involved. 


2+ years of discussion/debate, and 3+ months of prep time after activation (and after vast majority of miners already expliticly are ready for it), is not "rushing immediately."  Bitcoin does not have the luxury of waiting perpetually, it is a market product, competing now with a thousand rivals. It has gotten dangerously close to losing its position. Given what I do in my day job I have decent optics into this. Note that the heads of the major Bitcoins wallets, Blockchain and Coinbase, both agree with me explicitly. The business leaders, who have millions of users (nearly 2 orders of magnitude more than subscribers), are all seeing the same thing. 


"Scaling" will be a never ending issue for Bitcoin to deal with, for sure.  SegWit + 2MB base blocks don't magically solve scaling forever. But they do buy 1-3 years of expansion capacity on chain, while the level 2 solutions get built and rolled out. Bitcoin needs that breathing room.


UASF not only "risks" a network split, but guarantees it explicitly.  SegWit2x and the planned fork in November, supported by 80+% of miners, is vastly safer and less reckless than UASF, which is the alternative. It's been incredible to see this sub yell about the danger of a HF for two years, and then when UASF is proposed, because it's not a block increase yet still has all the danger (and maybe more) of a chain split, this sub has praised and applauded it.  Reason is not found in this sub any longer. Thank goodness the real discussion has been able to happen elsewhere.

Broken window fallacy refers to the idea that you can destroy something, and because resources will be spent to rebuild it, that means you've increased economic activity and created a net gain.  That is completely different than bitcoin mining, which is a simple case of using resources profitably - burning electricity, costing $X, in order to receive an economic gain of something above $X.  A Bitcoin miner is not breaking windows, he is producing windows - both windows and bitcoin mining are useful services which the producer realizes he can provide at a cost below his revenue, and thus he does it.

We don't issue a withdrawal request from an exchange to the user, that would take too long. We hold inventory of all coins, and send orders from our own inventory instantly to the user. Also, not sure if your "8%" number was just an example... our spread is nowhere near that. It varies based on liquidity of the specific coin pair, and ranges generally from 0.1-1%.  But yes, to get the best rate, always use the "Specific Amount" option.

To clarify, I've never renounced US citizenship (nor tried to), though I can't say it's an unattractive proposition. My best guess is that this "list" can have people added to it by any government agency for any reason (with no recourse or due process). I was probably added to the list by some agency who wanted to catch me crossing the border with $1mm in cash without declaring it on their cute little form or something similar. Then, they'd have the pretense to arrest me and hassle me about anything they wish. The border in the US is simply used as a "Constitution-Free Zone" and law enforcement take advantage of this to set their little claws into anyone traversing it... legal rights be damned. One time I mentioned to the guy harassing me, "have you heard of the 4th Amendment" and he responded, "Have you heard of the Patriot Act?"  No joke :(

That's true sometimes depending on the specific coin pair, the time, the size of the order, and market conditions. ShapeShift plugs into most major exchanges and bases its rate on the best it can find, and adds margin for slippage and profit. This is sometimes worse rate than going to a specific exchange, and sometimes is better. And if your time is at all valuable to you, consider the cost of that.

SegWit2x is the industry's attempt to get SegWit to happen, and to break the deadlock that has plagued this community for 2+ years.

There is no waste where profits and losses are privatized. If a miner believes he is wasting some of his resources, he will turn off the miner. Problem solved. Bitcoin could only be wasteful if its costs were socialized, and those who bore them couldn't stop.

No it isn't. "Backed by faith" is a meaningless statement. Backing refers to an obligation of one party to redeem something for another. When dollars were backed by gold, it meant banks or a government were obligated to redeem the dollars for a specific weight of gold.

@_date: 2016-07-16 15:21:22
OP - I upvoted this because you're addressing issues and opinions, and not attacking or vilifying people (mostly). Thank you for the civil discourse.
To address your points:


I agree. I'm thrilled with all three of those projects. I understand they take time, and I appreciate that they're moving forward steadily with the hard work of many very talented people. Thank you to all the teams working on those.




Now you're starting to make blanket statements about diverse groups of people which will inevitably degrade the quality of your argument. I don't and haven't endorsed either XT nor Classic, but I also respect the right of people to try competing for different implementations of Bitcoin. Remember decentralization?  I did think it was technically and rhetorially incorrect that those competing implementations were labelled "altcoins" and discussion of them banned from this sub. That was appalling.


Indeed, those projects didn't get the traction their supporters hoped they would. However, a sincere observer should note that they failed not because "bigger blocks are wrong," but because of specific issues people had with the leadership of those projects. You perpetuated this narrative yourself when you said their "developers are totally incompetent." Why is this an important distinction? Because it means the advocacy of larger blocks is still very much alive within the community (which, it should be noted, does not end at the edges of r/bitcoin). Again, for the record, I didn't endorse either XT nor Classic, and yet still I advocate marginally larger blocks.


Heh... well there is truth to that comparison. turned out to largely be an angry reactionary environment to Core, which I didn't find healthy or productive. There is a very important point though: the ONLY reason exists is because a significant number of Bitcoiners felt that an entire swath of opinion was being systematically suppressed at When you tell a bunch of people, "That manner by which you want to improve Bitcoin actually makes it an altcoin and not welcome here..." then don't be surprised when the community fractures and turns into waring factions.   It should also be said, slightly in jest, that if is the ZeroHedge of Bitcoin, has become the MSNBC of Bitcoin, blindly trumpeting the status quo, vilifying anyone who disagrees with the current leadership about any issue. It's a great way to drain out the diversity of opinion which is supposed to be one of our virtues as a decentralized community. And hey... sometimes ZeroHedge has really important news that nobody else is talking about. 


I'm all for keeping bullshit out of conversations. I realize subs must have moderation. When that turns into systematically removing entire swaths of genuine discussion, it has crossed a line.


I don't advocate &gt;our developers are some of the smartest people in the world
Agreed. I'm immensely grateful for the work they do. 


I'm not angry at coredevs. I am, however, advocating the importance of including conservatively larger blocks as one important and somewhat urgent aspect of the scaling challenge Bitcoin faces. 


I don't think I'm cheerleading anger and disruption. I am cheerleading open discourse, anti-censorship, and conservatively larger blocks (not instead of other upgrades, but as a compliment)
I'll add that you call out Roger and myself in particular... because we have been vocal in this debate. Him and I don't hold the same opinions on this topic, though we both respect each other. And while we've both been vocal, many others in the community, specifically the leaders of other Bitcoin businesses, are just totally fed up with the level of discourse and the vilification, and they just don't even comment publicly, or at least in any longer. 
On the topic of scale, I'm putting together a blog post that explains my opinion in long-form. People are welcome to consider it and come to their own conclusions. 
And again, OP, thanks for the open letter. 1 beer

It enables easier development and deployment of smart contracts than Bitcoin. This doesn't mean Bitcoin is "worse" because it doesn't offer that (indeed we see that added complexity causing risk with the DAO issue), and it doesn't mean Bitcoin can't improve in the future to do the same, and it doesn't mean Eth doesn't have it's own bugs/issues to sort out, but that's the basic value proposition. 
Both BTC and ETH are experimenting in blockchain technology. They are different enough to be good compliments, and each community can and should learn from the other. Indeed, I don't see why they should even be separate communities.

Useful commodities do not require backing. Gold is not backed by anything. Cars are not backed by anything. Diamonds are not backed by anything. 
Backing (which means, an obligation of another party to redeem one thing for another) is only useful/important if the thing being backed has itself no utility. Since Bitcoin is useful itself, it requires no backing.

Regarding the SEC, yes guilty as charged, I didnt get a permission slip from them to sell equity in SatoshiDICE. Investors made 18% in 9 months in BTC terms and over 300% in USD terms... but the SEC was mad that they werent included in the process.

SegWit is happening. A 2MB HF is happening. Genuine Bitcoiners should do what they can to ensure these proceed as safely and smoothly as possible, so we can get back to the real work in front of us.

Here's the answer:  By then, it's 2-5 years in the future, and 2nd layer solutions like Lightning are well developed and widespread.  Blocks don't necessarily need to increase in size forever, but they sure as hell should be bigger than 1MB during this critical time in Bitcoin's growth.

As someone who's been in Bitcoin since 2011, "Mob mentality of tribal superstitious natives" is exactly how I'd describe this sub as well.  
@_date: 2016-07-22 06:48:21


A "public tantrum" is how you describe my post? 


If you don't think the biggest hard fork to ever occur in a blockchain is relevant in this sub *if for no other reason than to highlight the dangers of hard forks due to community sentiment* then I don't know how to respond. Animated gif  about rocket going to moon... let's have another! Wall Street Journal article about biggest hard fork in history... off topic! 


Conflict of interest? Let's talk about that. 95% of my net worth is in Bitcoin. I've been building projects and advocating the Bitcoin industry for over five years. And guess what, Bitcoin is stronger to the extent it has greater utility, and as other people build interesting blockchain assets (inevitable), ShapeShift enables easy exchange between these systems and Bitcoin. If you think that's "bad for Bitcoin" or "not welcome 'round here!" then fine, history can judge both of our opinions. Do I have a conflict of interest? Yes, I'm hopelessly biased against fiat flag money and have dedicated my life to destroying it. And when I see what *should* be the most important subreddit in the industry removing important information about how this technology is developing, I'm not going to stay silent.  I profit hugely as Bitcoin grows, that is my bias, and I'm not going to sit around circle jerking to moon gifs when important issues are affecting this community.


I did message a mod. I messaged BashCo yesterday with the exact screenshot I posted in the OP, and asked what was going on. I got no response. Am I to bring my concerns to each gatekeeper individually before I bring them to the community? Is that the principle upon which decentralized money is to be built and discussed?


Unless it's negative, right? That's super healthy. Bitcoin benefits when it only hears bad echo chamber news about other parallel systems, eh? Bullshit. Bitcoin is stronger when its community is educated, wise, humble, and productive. 


Now you're just working very hard to intentionally avoid my point and denounce my motives. That has become far to common a practice here. It's exactly the same kind of bullshit that the crowd suffers from when they endeavor to smear Blockstream by attacking their perceived motives. 


Sorry, that's bullshit. Me talking about other digital assets is not "pumping altcoins" any more than me talking about Bitcoin is "pumping Bitcoin." This technology is important, it is diverse, it is dynamic, and while it may offend you to hear this, Bitcoin does not constitute all the innovation in this industry. The arrogance of Bitcoiners right now is one of its biggest vulnerabilities. 


The fact that you believe only Bitcoin can have "legitimate value" and "everything else is a dirty scam because not bitcoin" doesn't make it true. You remind me of the gold bugs who I spent eons arguing with in 2011-2012, who were so obstinate against Bitcoin because they had grown up to believe "only gold is money." 


I used to think that. In fact, I'm a Bitcoiner interested in topics relevant to Bitcoin that help it achieve success. This sub is becoming a net negative to that end.

Krugman still doesn't understand that the value comes from the utility of the payment network (he shares this problem with Peter Schiff, which is interesting because they are on opposite ends of the ideology spectrum). However, at least he's not calling it an outright scam or ponzi scheme.
I really don't get why it's so hard. Some people find a global, instant, zero-fee, zero-censorship payment system valuable... thus bitcoins have a price. 
I was pleasantly surprised when Krugman admitted that dollars have value because they're "backed" by men with guns.

Yeah I refer to that time as "the dark days"... basically all the people who didn't understand the fundamental power of Bitcoin went from "this is cool" to "Bitcoin is a scam/tulip bubble/going to zero".  Some of us on the forums tried to hold sentiment together, but damn, many people were soooo pessimistic. I think people who got burned in the bubble wanted to spread their misery and make the Bitcoin supporters feel guilty.
Lots of people were shaken out then and left the community. Only the die-hard supporters remained, and built businesses, even while the price fell precipitously. 
Honestly it took a pretty firm belief in this system to stay involved during those months. It's hard to "know that you're right" when the world (as expressed through the market price) is saying you're wrong. 
But all we can say now is... SCOREBOARD!

It should be noted that the US has already defaulted multiple times in its history. The most recent was in 1971, when Nixon broke the gold-dollar link.

The most important take-away is that the dollar was relatively stable from 1776 until 1913. The Fed was created in 1913 to "stabilize the dollar", and since then, the dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power. So 150 years of no lost purchasing power, then 100 years of perpetual decline.

As a libertarian, I support both. 
To attempt an explanation of your observation though, I suggest the following: Most libertarians who are interested in money and technology learned about bitcoin from 2010-2013 and became advocates of it early on. Some portion of these people, unfortunately, then made the mistake of thinking that there can only be Bitcoin in existence, and anything else is a "shitcoin" that isn't worth any attention. I call these people flag-waivers... they care more about tribalism and duty to one brand than about the creative marketplace of competing and complimentary technologies (indeed the irony is palpable). 
It kinda reminds me of the libertarian gold bugs who, correctly believing gold to be good money, were unable to see that Bitcoin was ALSO good money. They saw it as an either-or proposition, and since they were on Team Gold they had to be against Team Bitcoin.  Now we see many on Team Bitcoin who feel they must be against Team Ethereum.
In reality, libertarians should be on Team Market and be opposed to Team Fiat... and any technology which advances the former or reduces the latter should be applauded and encouraged.

This is just a rehashing of the "deflation is bad" argument. 
Why is it wrong? Because if the problem with Bitcoin is that "it appreciates too much", and this causes it to be "non useful", then it will stop appreciating, and likely fall in price. This then corrects the problem.
In other words, "deflation" is a self-correcting process. In reality, Bitcoin will find an equilibrium price, and as long as people find it a useful way to transfer value instantly, anywhere, then it'll grow in adoption.
Deflation is also bullshit because while it encourages saving instead of spending, this is a good thing, not a bad thing. People would be more careful what they consume, and they'd be encouraged to produce rather than consume. This is the opposite of the inflationary world we live in, and it would be far healthier.

Altcoins don't have the same security provided by the miners, and don't have the infrastructure built up around Bitcoin. When I say that it's the "network" that makes Bitcoin valuable, I don't mean just the p2p network, but also everything else that makes Bitcoin an ecosystem. While the core code can be copypasted easily by altcoins, everything else cannot.

Sovereign Living is a new television series currently in production. The show is about exactly what the title says :)  I've known John Bush (the protagonist) from my Free Stater days up in New Hampshire, and worked with him to sponsor this PSA video about Bitcoin which will run on every episode throughout the season. 
The video ad was just released as they are doing a "Bitcoin Celebration Week"
I've seen the first and second episode of the show. It's extremely well-produced, and will bring a lot of hearts and minds over to the ideas of liberty in a unique fashion.

No. The Euro is failing because it can be printed and manipulated, and because people in the eurozone are forced to use it even when it doesn't make sense. Bitcoin cannot be printed, or manipulated, and is purely voluntarily.

Bitcoin works amazingly as collateral. For example, let's say you want a loan of $100,000.  If you can post $100,000 worth of Bitcoin to a lender, he can offer you the loan risk free, and thus at a low or zero interest rate. You can pay back the loan, and get your Bitcoins back. Then, you never had to sell the coins, but have used them to obtain normal capital.
Or consider a business that needs to order equipment, and wants to pay later. If it can post BTC collateral, the vendor should be happy to send the equipment.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:15:32

You're looking at the mining process. Forget that entirely - it's just the method which creates the new coins.
It's not the mining we care about. So why are we obsessed with Bitcoin? Because it's the first time in the history of the planet that money can be privately stored and transferred.  This frees humanity from several evils, primary of which is the centralized control and manipulation of currency by Governments, and secondarily by banks. 
It's the first time private property is actually achievable. Think about the ramifications for a while.

It exploded because of the understanding of Cyprus. In other words, the world saw first hand the need for a "bank account" out of the reach of governments. Cypriots weren't buying BTC, but the world started buying a little because they saw what was happening to the Cypriots. The rally also happened because of the FinCEN guidance which happened several days prior to Cyprus. These two events and their resulting press coverage drove the price in April.

Of course speaking at the Bitcoin Conference is going to be preaching to the choir, in general. However, even many people who are Bitcoin enthusiasts don't quite understand why exactly Bitcoin is such good money, and the importance of its attributes for that purpose.

Or maybe he did know how the market would react. Thus the price is back roughly where it was yesterday.
What you're not realizing, abc523, is that with the release of the shares also come NEW DIVIDENDS for those shares. So it is not like new shares are dumped on the market which also fight for the same dividends, thus lowering the value of all shares. Each 1m shares gets 1% of earnings, so now MPEX gets 11% instead of 10% of earnings. When the second tranche is opened on the market later, MPEX will get 12% of earnings. 
See the difference?

Certainly, if the Fed is destroying dollars, that is deflation.  I don't think "increasing the overnight lending rate" would mean dollars were getting destroyed, though. It means they'd pay more interest for dollars loaned by banks to the Fed... but those dollars aren't destroyed. You could say that has a "deflationary effect" but it is only temporary because the banks will pull the money back out in the future, and plus they've earned $X in interest (more new money) while it sat there.

You do know that even though the $100 is in your ripple account, it's actually still with BitStamp, right? So your exposure to the exchange has not changed. Ripple needs to stop marketing itself as a way to transfer normal monies. It transfers debts, not the money itself.

All currencies are dependent on their relative exchange rates for judgement of worth. People are used to USD, so they frame BTC prices in terms of USD. But if you were european, you'd frame USD prices in terms of EUR. 
Over time, as BTC stabilizes and as people become more and more familiar with it, there will be an increasing tendency to think "in terms of bitcoin" but in all cases, a currency is only worth what it can be exchanged for, and BTC is no different than USD in this regard.

Yes agreed that all money other than cryptocurrencies or gold in one's own possion is an IOU. Bitcoin is amazing because it allows the digital transfer of an actual asset, instead of an IOU. Ripple claims to transfer assets, but the only asset it can transfer is XRP, or debts for other assets, which is not the same thing.

Good analysis. But I think anything related to mining can never be a driver of price. Mining is always a derivative of Bitcoin success, not a leader or cause of it. 
In the same way, gold mining could never be a driver of higher gold prices. But higher gold prices absolutely will affect gold mining.

Let's stop using the term "deflating" when discussing Bitcoin because it is not accurate. Deflation means a reduction in the money supply.  Bitcoin is inflationary, but the inflation rate falls toward zero (and is thus never negative). 
If you want to talk about Bitcoin price appreciation, or depreciation of prices as expressed in Bitcoin, then use terms other than "deflation" because that's not what is happening.

The fees are absolutely reasonable for the product and market they're catering to (it's not for your typical bitcoiner on reddit, of course). 
The average rich guy who wants to buy $200k of Bitcoin does not want to learn about wallet security. He'll happily pay a few percent to have everything taken care of for him... all he gets is the upside or downside of the asset itself. It's clean and easy, and he's got other things to deal with.

I have three main issues with it.
1) It is claimed to be a way to "send any currency" to anyone else. This is false. What it does is send IOUs. Any clearance of the IOU for dollars, for example, requires using the banking system to actually -send- the dollar. Ripple de-commoditizes money in this way, such that "a dollar" and "a dollar owed to you by John" are considered the same within Ripple, and yet economically they are different. A dollar in your pocket is not equal to a dollar held by John somewhere else. This model has profound economic problems which will not be seen until Ripple is widely used in the way it is intended. 
2) It is claimed to be open source. It is not. Ripple is a proprietary system riding on the goodwill of Bitcoin's open source dynamic. Ripple cannot be taken seriously until it is open source. 
3) OpenCoin has never released a deployment plan for XRPs. They hold 99 billion of the 100 billion XRPs created. This means they are basically a central bank, releasing "as they please" to whomever they please. Proponents say this is done to help "control speculation and volatility," in other words, to "stabilize the economy." This is exactly the excuse the Federal Reserve uses for releasing its currency at whim.
Ripple would've been interesting before Bitcoin arrived. Now though, it's a disingenuous and inferior money system. While points 2 and 3 above could be remedied by OpenCoin (seriously - we're back to trusting a single entity for our money system?!), point 1 cannot be fixed because it is the core proposition of Ripple. Point 2 and 3 are obnoxious (but serious) short and medium term issues. Point 1 is perpetual, and will be the ultimate reason Ripple likely falls short.

I disagree. The reason it is different is that Bitcoin provides significant advantages to whomever is using it. Even though only maybe a million people around the world use Bitcoin, it has tremendous value to me in terms of my ability to move money around. It is superior to banks.
Esperanto's usefulness, it's utility, is primarily a result of large scale adoption. That is, the benefits of Esperanto only really occur if tons of people speak it. It's true that Bitcoin's utility goes up when more people use it, but adoption is not the -only- factor in its success. Fees are near zero, transfers are instant, 3rd parties are not needed... regardless of the number of people using Bitcoin.
Esperanto doesn't provide much, if any, utility to the small number of people using it today. Bitcoin provides huge utility to the small number of people using it today. That's the difference.

Since you can't actually guarantee that the value will go up, you'll find that I'll be considerably more willing to spend it today.

"A real free market commodity would compensate for increased demand with increased production."  Ehhhh not really. Bitcoin is absolutely a free market commodity because it doesn't rely on force. Price is based purely on supply and demand.

Just because you see the Gox ticker say $X, doesn't mean you can buy for $X through a broker like CoinBase. Think of the market price like a spot price. Whatever the spot price of gold is, that is used as a guide for what a retail price should look like, but the retail price is always a little higher. In the case of CoinBase, they are going to keep a small spread as their profit for providing you the convenient brokering service. Nothing wrong with this unless they specifically tell you one price and give you another.

People like you have been saying that same negative, pessimistic crap since Bitcoin was about $1.  Some crazy kids thought maybe in a year or two it could be worth $10, maybe $100!  Nah, they're just living in fantasy land. 
There is a very good reason why Bitcoin can absolutely appreciate into the thousands of dollars per. There are 21m of them. If the system grows, they will be worth that. The system will grow quickly, or it will die, so yes, in ten years Bitcoin will absolutely be worth thousands of dollars each or it will be gone. Understanding the likelihood of both outcomes is wise, not fantasy.

All gambling (except games like poker) has a negative expected return (the house has the edge).  But it's fun, because you can win or lose... it's entertainment. When you go to a movie, you lose 100% of your money, but get utility from the experience. If you enjoy the thrill of gambling, then when you gamble you will lose some portion of your money likely, but maybe you'll win some, and in any case you had a good time. That's why people gamble.
SatoshiDice, specifically, has a very small house edge. So, if you enjoy gambling, it's much smarter to do it at SatoshiDice than a Vegas or other online casino.

Using a more stable currency as the cost-basis =/= pegging. 
It is much more reasonable for merchants to continue pricing as a conversion from USD instead of trying to pick a BTC amount when the price is volatile. No need to fight or complain about this behavior - it's perfectly rational.
As Bitcoin stabilizes, the urge to do this will be less and less. Just let it happen.

Correct. There was no dilution. 100m shares exist. 10m were on MPEX before yesterday, now 11m are. Each 1m of shares represents 1% of SD earnings. So the new shares do not harm anyone's earnings, whatsoever. The only difference is that now MPEX owners get 11% of earnings instead of 10%.

No that's not at all what I'm saying. 
What I am saying is that those who DO have Bitcoin now have more and more things to spend them on. This makes Bitcoin more valuable as a currency, and it makes it more likely that people, at the margin, will accept Bitcoins as a form of payment. 
Few people accepted Paypal back in the day, because it was a pain to link a bank account and withdraw it. Now, many people accept it, and hold a paypal balance, because they know there are many places to spend it online.
As people realize Bitcoin can be spent, they will be more willing to receive it themselves. It is the network effect in action.

I disagree with this. Don't spend your coins unless there is something you specifically want to buy with them. Spending for spending sake helps nobody. You deciding to buy $50k of coins already helped the economy, by raising the purchasing power of everyone else's coins. You don't "owe" anything more by spending needlessly. 
Keep your investment safe. Buy more coins if you want to do some spending.
@_date: 2013-08-31 22:54:47
Sure, your deposits could be seized in a bank failure scenario. But you know what? Right now, every year, 3-5% of your funds are already seized - stolen through debasement. 
Does it really matter if 3% of your deposits were confiscated outright this year, versus the deposits simply purchasing 3% fewer goods? No. In both cases, you're being stolen from. In both cases, you're already having your wealth "bailed in" to cover other peoples' profligacy. 
Fortunately, nobody here needs to be victim to that any longer.

Since the start of Bitcoin, the number of people holding coins has increased day after day. While maybe a few dozen were intially involved, then it became a few hundred, then a few thousand.

Actually "hording" raises the value of each coin, enabling others to use that capital to create the systems, goods, and services that build an economy. The economy is not helped merely by people spending all the time on everything. Savings is healthy, as capital formation is crucial. If there is nothing people want to spend their coins on at the given price, they should save them. Simple as that.

It should be noted that Bitcoin is actually an inflationary currency. It is inflating right now, and will continue to do so for a hundred years.

I agree fully with Garzik on this. Blacklists are a bad idea. They turn the contained, limited private damage of a theft into uncontained, socialized damage, as innocents subsequently receive the tainted coins.
If private companies want to keep their own internal blacklists of coins from obvious thefts, then fine. But universal blacklists of coins are futile at best and counterproductive at worst.

Posted this on the author's blog:
Dear Mr. Thomas, consider that the fact that Bitcoin is not tangible bestows upon it special properties which gold/silver do not have. Namely, Bitcoin can be hidden far more easily (and in any quantity). It can be transported anywhere in the world, instantly, without relying on a middleman. And, being intangible, it can be utilized in our modern digital economy in a great many creative ways.
Precious metals are amazing money. But so is Bitcoin. Every free-market supporter would do well to really understand the merits of both, and learn how to use them both to achieve a long-overdue separation from government fiat.

Not necessarily true... it can absolutely be random chance. When I was running SatoshiDICE, there were days that I would swear were evidence of fraud/server compromise. But they weren't, it was just bad luck for the house.  Just-Dice's house edge is lower, and thus even more prone to these swings... it's very dangerous to be the house with an edge like that. It's something one has to learn from experience, I think. I now have a far higher appreciation for randomness, variance, and statistics in general.

What you're referring to is another point he made. I didn't attempt to address all his points in my reddit comment. Since you asked so nicely, I'll address that one also.
If his point is that people don't price in Bitcoin because it's volatile, then yes, he's correct. But the question asked by the interviewer wasn't "Is Bitcoin a great way to price things?"  The question was, "will bitcoin be successful... does it have legs?" 
And the reason Bitcoin can be wildly successful, without being a great way to price things (at least not yet), is because of these things called computers. Computers are amazing in their ability to do math, such as taking a USD price and instantly converting it into a BTC price at current market rates. This happens with every website that accepts BTC. It happens in the background, with neither stress nor inconvenience placed on the consumer or the merchant. 
Pricing goods natively in Bitcoin is not a prerequisite for global Bitcoin domination, though you'd discover it would be one of the many fun results.

I think the political links were very important in the earlier days for establishing the ideological base of support behind Bitcoin. Not everyone is an ancap here, but a large number of those involved in Bitcoin are ideologically driven by this sentiment. Thus the links were appropriate.

There is nothing wrong with people recognizing the brilliance of Bitcoin, buying tons of them, and then showing others why it's so brilliant. If there was no fundamental usefulness of the system, then this would just be a pump and dump, but when the system is direly needed by mankind, then profiting from the promotion of it is a fantastic incentive.
The fixed supply of Bitcoin encourages the earliest adopters to take the most risk. It's an elegant and brilliant incentive structure, and it's the way that Bitcoin can outcompete massive corporations and governments who have their own money to blow on things.

This is NOT (yet) a proper debate between me and Schiff. However, Ed and Ethan had Peter on their show, and then asked me to come on for the second half, in order to clear up some of his concerns. 
Hopefully this will help prompt Peter into inviting me onto his show so we can finally have the real debate :)  Peter knows I'm ready and willing (Tom Woods and Ed/Ethan have all conveyed to Peter that this needs to happen).

Altcoins are more volatile, and more risky, than Bitcoin. So, the reasons one would desire to exit Bitcoin and move to cash are typically going to be opposite reasons from why someone would exit Bitcoin and move to an altcoin. 
In general, every market that connects with Bitcoin will have the effect of, long term, making Bitcoin more stable. Buuut, altcoins are so experimental, small, and volatile themselves that I don't know how much effect they could have. 
In any case, this doesn't seem like a sufficient reason to advocate altcoins :)

Multiple currencies can and will exist, if there is a meaningful difference between them. Otherwise, due to network effects of money marketability, a market will tend to settle on only one medium of exchange. In other words, the tendency is for one medium of exchange, because that's the most efficient. Multiple mediums of exchange should only be expected if there is substantive difference that overcomes the efficiency gain.
And before you say that the world has many fiat currencies, that's a product of law and coercion, not of markets.

Let's pump up a company with fake sales prior to an IPO, then pay back the same amount of BTC months later when BTC is 9x higher in exchange rate! And during those months, we'll pay roughly 20% in dividends!

Ugh.  "In fact, they measure the value of bitcoins in... you guessed it... dollars." 
Guess how you measure the value of anything? By pricing it in terms of something else. The value of a loaf of bread is $3.24 dollars. The value of an ounce of gold is $1250 dollars. And... the value of a dollar is 0.90 Swiss Francs. 
Does that mean dollars are subordinate or inferior to Swiss Francs? No. It means value is always expressed in terms of its exchange rate with something else.

Mr. Moran - thank you for reaching out to the Bitcoin community. If you would ever like further information from an insider, please contact me on skype (same username).
What I would like you to know is this: The invention of a decentralized monetary system will go down in history as one of the most important inventions of all time. Humans rarely recognize great achievements when they happen - who would've known how extremely different the world would look after the printing press, or the micro-processor, or the airplane? Decentralized currency is a similarly revolutionary invention.
The way that this will change the world is unknown. What it does, in effect, is to change the economic relationship between individuals around the world. It will have pros, and perhaps cons. It will generate tremendous wealth, and it will improve the lives of average people. It may even solve many of the seemingly-unrelated issues with which world leaders grapple unsuccessfully. 
This is not just another PayPal. This is something special. Please treat it the way you would have hoped the political elites would have treated the printing press so long ago. Indeed, both speech, and money, can be very dangerous, but this potential harm is no better of an excuse for stiffing Bitcoin than it would've been for stifling Gutenberg's marvelous gift.

Not at all. Marketplaces are not "screwed up" by new people entering them. Institutional investors will actually smooth out the roller coaster, because it will deepen the market, and these types of people aren't sitting on Gox all day trading. They are buying to hold for a year or five as a speculative investment if this thing takes off.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:51:53
It's maybe not so much "wrong" but rather "very foolish" to buy something just because it's been going up. If, on the other hand, the girl learned a little about Bitcoin, and started to understand the -reasons- that it was a valuable item, then buying (even if only to make money on speculation) is totally legitimate. 
There is nothing wrong with price speculation, nor with gambling, but in either case one should attempt to understand the thing which is being speculated upon.

"The house always wins"  =/=  "The house tends to win in the long run"  If it was the former, there'd be no point to gambling.

Web wallets have risks that desktop wallets don't, and vice versa. Security of both will tend to get better.
There is no way to "solve" the problem that some people will have thefts happen. Better site security + education over time will make thefts rare, but insofar as bitcoin is an asset that must be held somewhere, like gold and cash, it will always have thefts. Fortunately, it is easier to securely store Bitcoin than both gold and cash.

It's probably better than debit cards, though ;)

Dollars have value because people are forced to use them. 
Bitcoins, and gold, have value because they are useful, the former as solely a means of exchange, and the latter as both means of exchange and for ornamental/industrial uses. 
Money doesn't have "value based on faith." If fiat, it has value derived from forced use, and if bitcoin or gold, it has value derived from utility.

Baidu's announcement was a way bigger deal than speculation about a few Cypriots. 
There were never actual Cypriots buying bitcoin to avert the bank theft in any significant number. Instead, people saw Cyprus as a sign of what's to come, and this justified increased demand for Bitcoin. Baidu is also a sign of things to come, but it's a bigger deal than Cyprus because it is a signal to all Asian business.

Speculating is a noble pursuit. It is the ultimate, "put your money where your mouth is." You risk your own wealth on things you judge, through your reasoning, to be more valuable than the marketplace currently realizes. Success from speculation is not easy, and rewards from it should not be sneered at.
