And name your price, youre awesome! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:43:45
I'd say that waiting 26 hours is plenty even with $4 fee
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:01:23
At least two i think
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:52:31

Stupid question sorry, still a beginner but what are the perks of running a node on your own? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:05:27
But then again, even if it crashed to like $4k, I'd lose like $40 so i'll survive.
Im 22 btw, so thats a student investment budget hahha

Coinbase verification took maybe 2 minutes in my case. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:07:10

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:23:13
Was thinking about it and probably will after getting my hands on some funds. Still a poor student hahah. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:01
