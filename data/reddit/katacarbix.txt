You're so lucky you live in a major population center. I still haven't seen a single place that accepts BTC in Minnesota's Twin Cities. Granted, I don't usually go into the city.
@_date: 2014-07-05 04:47:50
My excuse is that I was only 15 and nothing could convince my parents to hook up their bank account with a site like that.
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:58:25
And of course, none near me.
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:30:32
I've found Bitcoin to be very popular among producers.

Thanks, very little of the page loaded for me on mobile.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:16:16
almost every post is a request...
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:55:55
Make sure you compare their values to gold, not each other.
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:22:46
technically it's al-Jabra

Isn't the point of that pseudonym that Satoshi is Japan's most popular given name, and Nakamoto the most popular family name? Kinda like Mohammad Ali, right?
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:53:39
Well, don't forget that "it's not a scam!" doesn't help

Oh man, this reminds me that I want to buy vinyls of my music and music I like.
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:14:43
Dang, I just bought something from there :(
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:46:55
Well we should ban @_date: 2014-04-09 20:34:08
Like, sidechain compression? What does that mean in this context?
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:37:37
Because I have to set up a checking account that I don't have with the marketplace.
@_date: 2014-04-25 01:00:59
how bazaar
@_date: 2015-05-03 18:07:47
I understand the sentiment behind that idea, but the problem isn't getting it to your phone; for all OP cares, it could be your phone's btc address. The problem is that a permanently printed keychain can't be entirely anonymous.

The nice thing about ARM is that manufacturers can highly customize them before fabrication and ensure shit like IME isn't enabled.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:03:49
Right, it's still on the manufacturer to make those decisions. It just makes it a little harder to sneak that in.
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:34:56

Why do old hard drives always print the capacity so small?
@_date: 2012-04-18 03:56:25
I would also like to know, thanks. And to the guy above me, wanna co-own it, being in the same state? I'm under 18 myself, so I could probably do something other than handling the money.
@_date: 2012-01-20 03:49:15
I second this.

I read that and immediately knew; nobody asks for your appliance bills.

Ehh, I'm not the type for a portfolio. I'm really young to be a professional/
@_date: 2012-01-10 03:38:43
DAE think the Android Marketplace should accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-01-14 06:08:02
Huh. If I ever had a reason to really use Mt. Gox, I still would never give them this information.
@_date: 2012-01-01 20:37:29
Wtf... I live in the Twin Cities area and I've never heard of this.
@_date: 2012-04-03 01:54:35
Thanks! By the way, I've already got 2 things on there. I like it!
@_date: 2012-04-11 02:53:13
@_date: 2012-04-01 05:12:23
Posted my address in edit
@_date: 2012-04-02 23:06:25
I like this, but what if I put stuff on there but nobody buys it? Am I basically just giving you money for my failed work?
@_date: 2016-09-13 22:12:00
Combine that with machine learning and you got yourself a basically unstoppable sentient car.
@_date: 2016-09-06 20:48:37


bu- but muh second amendments!
@_date: 2012-04-10 02:38:57
Ok, I'll look there.
@_date: 2016-09-06 20:50:55
what the fuck are you on
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:15:05
Even just simple HTTP servers?
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:13:57
Torrents do that? That's smart.
@_date: 2011-12-29 06:43:46
I have decided that, to hopefully be successful with Bitcoins someday, I will save them up now over time, and then watch businesses incorporate Bitcoins in their business.
Also, I would like any word on how this *wouldn't* work.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:38:48
Or if you're using an international keyboard, AltGr + B
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:00:01
So given that it's extremely unlikely but still can happen, has it ever happened before?
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:40:20
It's a modifier key that allows for more characters than are on the keyboard. It's helpful for those languages that have accented letters in addition to the usual English alphabet.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:36:28
RemindMe! 1 year "Does ₿ look like a bitcoin symbol yet?"

or walrus
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:28:20
What's the catch? Why are you being downvoted a bunch? Well anyways I'll take up your offer :P
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:26:21
Haha thanks!

[Ah, the old Reddit Cash-aroo](
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:08:05
I've never owned more than 30 USD worth of Bitcoin. Some I got by mining, some by selling music online, and buying some in cash. I followed Bitcoin from around 2011 when it was ~$4 / btc, all the way to its peak at $1000 / btc, to now. It sucks not having the financial stability to experiment with investing in it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:04:46
Why would someone want to DDoS you?
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:55:17
Weird, I never heard big news about people not using it. Can you please explain nicely why people shouldn't?
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:41:30
Do people use it? Do many entities offer exchange for other currencies?
Yes, [you're goddamn right]( it's a real currency.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:30:31
I was one of the first few people to ever get on the CoinDL bandwagon.

Skimming through the front page when I see the title and read it wrong, as:


@_date: 2013-08-13 21:09:26
It says right at the bottom...


@_date: 2013-11-28 04:01:33
I can't trust myself with newly discovered circlejerk subreddits. I always catch myself as I'm about to correct someone or tell someone how stupid of an idea something is.
@_date: 2013-08-02 03:34:20
Good explanation; thank you.
@_date: 2013-08-17 23:34:52
I don't understand the controversy.
Hand a $1 bill to someone without anyone looking. Is that traceable? No.
Can you buy drugs with both Bitcoins and USD? Yes indeed.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:26:21
You must make a considerable amount...
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:37:59
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:13:42
I was giving you a response to your code.
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:50:06
Yay, Ubuntu font!
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:26:36
It's nice they kept themselves out of a ponzi scheme.

People, donot does the cocain. is bad.

Let's all support this because then the price may boost even higher!

Nah, Papyrus gives a better feel.

To the public: expect lag from heavy load.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:56:32
I use Electrum because it makes me feel involved.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:21:57
@_date: 2013-08-14 18:27:11
I wholeheartedly agree with that, but we were talking about right now.
@_date: 2013-05-05 11:59:10
I just use Electrum and that's all I need.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:56:47
That would be cool to have a movie based on the invention of a cryptocurrency. But not directed by Shamallamadingdong.
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:35:22
I really want to buy a private-ish (invitation-only) island and make all the cool stuff legal and official. But that's probably still my kid imagination.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:04:39
Thank you, but how do you use it?
@_date: 2013-05-02 23:33:59
I still don't know how to use a paper wallet
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:43:17
Hey, you're they guy whose site was removed from AdSense (or whatever) because of "drug dealing"! I remember that!

Bah, you know what I mean.
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:14:48
What is this 28 dollar story? I keep seeing it referenced, but I've never seen it before!
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:05:11
But I like Dvorak more...
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:39:44


Did someone say "In Time"?
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:51:29
But if he used a throwaway, he wouldn't have gotten any delicious karma that mattered.
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:45:51
I don't know, that looks pretty intimidating to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:31:23
I was mining overnight... :D
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:39:35
But I like Bitcoin more...
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:15:34
I wish my day were made :(
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:33:12
Is that like "First of the Year (Equinox)"?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:50:41


What an unfortunate last name...
Edit: TIL that most people don't know what a "joke" is.
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:51:13
ah :(
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:09:35
Is there anything wrong with MtGox?
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:54:05
Totally buying it. I'm so excited for Haunted House EP!
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:26:27
What? You mean "fucking"? You can say that here.
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:44:50
Sit your grandmother down in front of a Bitcoin wallet program and tell her to send 0.01 BTC to some address. That's what it's like for anyone relatively new to Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:41:37
Oh my god, thank you! I've been trying many times to get pyObjC to work so I could make this myself, and *now* I find out it's already been made!
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:13:31
It's officially a thing now.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:02:08
My question is: Why are you giving away 175 bucks?
@_date: 2013-06-22 17:21:29
It really depends on what you consider "active"
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:37:10
I'm willing to bet that all the people in the headquarters office are happy as fuck that he's gone.
