You are waaaay beyond his limit of thinking. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:36:12
And you expect people here to understand what you are talking about?
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:06:01
Can you people just please stop posting off topic financial news here! It's getting ridiculous! It serves no purpose other than to start a retarded Bitcoin circle jerk!
I'm here to read about Bitcoin! If i want to read something else i'll go somewhere else. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 11:07:05
No. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:20:31
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:12:57
I thought you were talking about Ross. 
Hilarious i now also get downvoted for asking for a source of a claim by the way. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:46:01
I've seen about 20 people mentioning this. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:19:02
All you do here is post random financial news to try and create a Bitcoin cirle jerk. It's getting real pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 21:17:00
Yes we know. It was posted 15 times 3 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 00:04:37
A lot of people here use drugs and obviously love Bitcoin. So a guy who ran a huge drug site that used Bitcoin is their ultimate hero. Because of that reality and facts don't matter anymore. He is innocent no matter what and the case against him is a scam. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:26:51
Wrong sub. This sub is about Bitcoin. Not telephones. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:21:25
I think we can do without your spam. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:23:02
Yes we know. Several other people before you already posted this off topic news trying to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:36:52
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:15:01
Awesome. You're the 2nd person to try and start a Bitcoin circle jerk today with 5 year old off topic facts. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:56:42
You are not allowed to ask such silly questions here. 
Just throw some Bitcoin at that country and all their financial problems will be instantly solved. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:52:13
This are young kids who want to feel like they are in control. Often nerds with no social skills. Bullied at school. This is their revenge at the world. 
And no idea why you think they believe in Bitcoin. Most just want some short term money. 
I can respect a hacking skill but your asskissing of these kids is just sad. These hacker kids are the cancer of the internet. They are nothing better than real life thieves and criminals. They aren't special in any way and deserve no respect whatsoever. They are just lowlife scum. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:35:05
No, we are not unaware about it here. Several people before you already posted about it trying to create a Bitcoin circle jerk. 
Maybe it's time to stop posting this off topic financial news here. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:27:50
Can't you read? I thought he was talking about Ross. Let me know if i need to explain it again. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:32:47
It's amazing how many people post the words "and here is why" in their title. As if each one of those posts are 100% true and fact. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:35:19
Why the downvotes? I'm just wondering what the op's opinion is. 
Maybe you people should try and understand what the voting system is for. Here is a hint: it's not for this. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:23:22
I guess he was unaware of it. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:35:40
How is it possible that 9 out of 10 people can't spell the word affect?
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:11:27
In your opinion did he or did he not run Silk Road. 
I'm asking this because you Ross fans are very confusing. 
He is your hero for running Silk Road but at the same time claim he is innocent and the fbi has no case. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 15:28:30
What's the # of your crack dealer?
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:00:45
They do take them down but because they get posted all day long they might miss a bunch. Or they are also just tired of it. 
Why do you think they made a rule against posted off topic financial news? Really, please tell me. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:28:48
So Ross didn't run Silk Road? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:15:51
Yes we know. Stop spamming your shitty blog. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:22:02
Then post is as an opinion and not as a fact. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 10:05:02
Please stop posting. Nobody here will miss your crap. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:01:29
5 year old news to start a Bitcoin cirle jerk...
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:18:18
So many people here who can predict the future. This place really is very special. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 02:58:25
Ah ofcourse. Because i want to read Bitcoin related news i must be a shill account.  
That makes a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:53:58
And downvoted for asking a question. 
Anything that is slightly negative towards Ross is not allowed here. This place is completely retarded. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:29:15
Just like 300 people before you already did. We could do without your blog spam. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:19:08
And what are we supposed to do with this?
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:16:35
No, some guy on a site said the FBI is lying so we can close the case. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:27:50
Posts like this always amaze me. What exactly goes on in your head when you ask for help and then provide no information at all?
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:16:09
So how much did you buy today?
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:41:03
I didn't even read it. Funny enough the "and here is why" posts are usually full of shit. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:30:04
That article is pretty much a copy and paste of the original blogpost. 9 out of 10 links that get posted here are just spam.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:06:35
No. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 21:06:43
Exactly! Grab the cock to your left and start fapping people!
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:18:30
Yes we know. We got it the first 75 times it was posted yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 18:13:23
Is it here in this specific sub for any other reason than to start a nice jerk? 
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:39:51
He is being charged with hiring a hitman. Should he walk without a trial?
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:48:54
When will you learn to stop reposting shit. 
This has been posted 10 times 3 days ago. 
If you'd stop posting nobody would miss a thing because every post of yours is a repost. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:30:57
Removed because the OP changed his post. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:43:07
Yes we know. Really, we know. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 15:07:23
You are easily one of the most retarded posters on this subreddit. 
All you do is post random off topic news and then add Bitcoin in the title. 
Are you mentally challenged or something?
@_date: 2014-09-09 18:11:50
Affecting not effecting. Is there really nobody who can spell that word correctly??
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:57:19
Your standard reply. 
Kinda hilarious coming from someone who thinks Cyprus is spelled Cypress. 
You're just another stoner kid trying to hype Bitcoin because you own 3 coins. Stop acting like you are some kind of financial expert. 
@_date: 2014-09-07 14:28:19
We got it the first 20 times 3 days ago. Please just stop.
