I say probably because he may get rich but it's not sure he'll be able to sleep at night.

That's definately what we'll be doing from now on.

The problem was, I started with little, won big, lost all... and after that, every time, I thought I could get back to big winnings and cash out.  
So I kept trying, and trying... until our savings account was empty.  
I never got back to big winnings.

I'll do something for her when she lets me near her. At the moment the best think I can do is to leave her alone.

The price of 2000 euros is a bargain. The price of lying to her and losing her trust... that's the highest price I've paid in my life.

The Netherlands. It's not a lot here either, but we are not rich: Only one of us is working (me) and we have to pay for my wife to go to school. Morgage, insurrances, ect.

Lastig, ze wil met geen mogelijkheid met me praten op het moment. (en terecht) Ik hoop dat ze bijdraaid, maar ik verdien het niet.

All different wallets. I change wallets from time to time, sometimes use my mobile phone, sometimes my PC. Sometimes I start with a fresh wallet. I'm not looking to proof that my story is true, just want to share with everyone that gambling is stupid and you will lose.
