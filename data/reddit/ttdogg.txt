@_date: 2017-09-16 16:31:20
If it's a requirement it should be clearly stated that they require it on there website. Never asked for all this info before.

Went to the chat at wallofcoins. 
Asked for a manager and they said mike was the manager gave me the run around again asking for gov id. Then disconnected me.  Went back on the chat and asked for mike the manager. And they said mike hasn't arrived yet. An no manager is there. I stated I was just chatting with mike the manager and the service rep said no I wasnt chatting with mike I was chatting with another customer service agent. Omg. Really unorganized. Can't believe I'm out 2k in btc. False representation. False advertisement. And manipulation.

That's not what they advertise is what I'm saying. 
After receiving my funds which is nonrefundable. Then asking for it is morally wrong. 
I'm not disagreeing with you.
