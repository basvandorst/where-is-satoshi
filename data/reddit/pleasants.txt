Almost-wife here. There are plenty of us interested and using Bitcoin. Hell,  I even introduced it to my partner and got him on board.

the views on the pastebin are actually very low. It's suprisingly not being spread around very much.

I had one customer pay for shipping in Bitcoin and it was an awesome  experience, but nothing since.
I'm a goldsmith and I make non-traditional conflict-free engagement and wedding rings, so I mostly sell to folks via word of mouth. When I have my "BTC accepted here" sign at shows it's a great  conversation starter, but I haven't really posted anything here in the community. 
My new line is launching Wednesday so I might ovary up and get some feedback from all of you then!

I had to turn off adblock and ghostery to have it play.

I bought before, during, and after the April 2013 peak and crash.  I held through $1200 and I want to buy some more right now, I just don't have any extra cash.

Same here! Have you gotten a lot of Bitcoin business?
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:21:48
That works! Thanks!

There's a pastebin.
I won't link to it, but it's already out there.
