It sure feels that way, especially without a clear explanation for such a sharp decline. Noobs caught up in the hype are no match for the sophisticated Wall Street shenanigans. Being a noob myself, I don’t fully understand these tricks but I suspect part of the recent rise to 20k was a Wall Street pump ahead of futures and the dump was covered by short positions. Next they buy it all up at a discount!

And like Satoshi Nakamoto before them, Pineapple Fund steps away from their world changing work, back into the currents of time. Bravo legend, Bravo.

I’m a fan of that podcast, it’s called “Tales From The Crypt”.
The guys on that podcast have a thing called “stacking sats” where they encourage their followers to buy $25 worth of Bitcoin every Saturday on Cash app, or something along those lines. When he asked Jack to participate in stacking sats, Jack’s response was that he had already reached his purchase maximum for some unspecified period of time. He did not say he made those buys every week.

My impression is that artificially increasing the supply like this results in actual BTC price suppression.

No fee to purchase BTC through cash app. I also prefer it over Coinbase.
