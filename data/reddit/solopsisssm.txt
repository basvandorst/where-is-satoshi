 I mean, it would have to tank hard for me to lose my investment. But, I mean, I risked that money because I could. I guess I'm just starting to feel bummed because of the sentiment around here, while I have been (probably very unrealistically) hoping that bitcoin will pull through and make it REALLY far. And I'm not saying it won't. Just that I can feel the fear around here, and that bums be out. 
I wish someone would just open a solid exchange.

A huge portion of the problem here is the fact that the other cryptos are ACTUALLY better than bitcoin. I believe in bitcoin and have. But strides have been made. I now believe in crypto. And I'm starting to think that bitcoin is the myspace of the crypto offerings. So...which one will be the facebook?

How did the advice work? Are you sending bitcoins in excess of 1k usd?

Ask him why he said bitcoin is a fraud and said that people who buy bitcoin are idiots,and then sat back as his company bought millions and millions of dollars worth of bitcoin the following day?
Call him out and ask him pointedly, "what do you have to say to the accusation that you slammed bitcoin and its investors in an effort to short the price for your own benefit - knowing the price would plummet after you said that, and as soon as it did, you went ahead and bought millions of it at a reduced price?"

Why they close your account?

Banks prob got a default setting to reject purchases from exchanges like CB. Even if bank didn't receive transaction, they should be able to allow future transactions from that bank to go through if you request it

I transferred a good amount from coinbase to Bread when there was a ton of congestion and it showed up almost instantly.  Let us know how it goes.

This. ALL week!

What scares me, personally, isn't the price dip. This shit happens regularly and this dip is minimal. What scares me is that - and maybe I'm imagining it? - the overall sentiment on Reddit around bitcoin today is increasingly negative. Usually there's a million people laughing about the dip and posting memes and shit. But today...I don't know, I can't put my finger on it. It feels different here today. It feels like people are scared, without coming right out and saying it. 
Maybe I'm mental. Who knows?

You're a fucking idiot karma_z . You can READ right? I mean you're ON Reddit. Jesus, use your fucking brain. Idiot.

Ok thanks

He's not scared of bitcoin. Right after he made those comments, he had his company buy an obscene amount of bitcoin ...knowing his comments would cause the value of each coin to drop and he could purchase at a cheaper price. It was just another Wall Street dick move to benefit himself - he knows the price is going to skyrocket

Is it worth buying any at this point, before august 1, even if there's a delay paying out to my bread wallet??
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:32:57
Is there anywhere else I can buy bitcoin without this issue?
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:24:41
Listen, I know this is not where it should be, but can someone just tell me where I can buy bitcoin right now and not worry about all this crap with coin base?
