Yup, don't forget the $5 wrench scenario.  
And on a more serious note I was talking to a friend who lives in Asia and he said a woman was murdered in Japan recently for her Bitcoin. 
And where I live, there was a story of an organised gang kidnapping and torturing somebody because they heard he won some money at casino.

It's only relative to the timescale that you plan to invest in.  If for example you are looking to double your money and withdraw it - then yes it very much is like blackjack...   but if you were investing money and decide to let it ride for 5 to 10 years, then it's completely different

I know this sounds really cheesy but there is a famous Chinese proverb that says;  the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago - the second best time is now.
If you rephrase your question and I asked do you believe bitcoin will be worth more in a few years time than it is now...  you will have your answer. 
Personally I believe bitcoin will be worth $100,000 or more in five years or so...  but that's just my opinion
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:09:27
I thought that was a vague enough answer..    :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:22:23
Joe Public needs to feel good about themselves for not investing in Bitcoin. They are smart people, remember...   So, when a story comes out about a third party company being hacked for Bitcoin - Joe Public read that as bitcoin has been hacked.  
Same with the price, it gains 10K but drops 2K - Joe Public needs to feel a genius about passing up bitcoin because of it dropping 2K (but forget about the 10K rise!).

In the UK you hear adverts on the radio occasionally from the FSC basically saying "don't worry if your bank goes bust, you're covered up to £85,000"  
Now, I understand it's there to reassure people - but the simple fact that they even need to play that advert in the first place is concerning enough to me!
It's basically a government announcement saying "everything is ok" - and when they do that,  you know it's not. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:52:11
I saw a post someone made either here or in r/bitcoinmarkets &amp; it gave an analogy of a company being successfully re branded as a PR exercise. That's exactly what this is seems to be - the stubbornness of the MSM &amp; bitcoin detractors cannot allow themselves to say "OK, we got it wrong - bitcoin does have awesome potential"  
But 'blockchain' they see as something shiny &amp; new, something *better* than bitcoin...  something they can get behind without losing face. 
It's beautiful really - let them continue, I say! :)

u/TDBit has answered this well - but I will just add the fact that there must be many investors out there who may be spooked by the idea of buying &amp; holding bitcoins themselves. To us guys here in r/bitcoin it seems so easy! But just imagine an older person who is interested in Bitcoin but has read scare stories of exchanges being hacked or people losing their bitcoins - they might be concerned the same could happen to them.
But now they have the option to buy shares in bitcoin, just the same as buying regular shares, through their trusted broker. For them it's easy.

exactly...  as i understand it, banks are interested in this technology because it is immutable &amp; is 'trustless' (no need for 'trust').  
So when people say 'the banks will just make their own blockchain' - well that's fine, they can, but it'd only be as good as their own database/ledger systems that they currently use...  
I'm not sure they've grasped Bitcoin's concept of 'vires in numeris' yet (or PoW, as you say).

Personal Financial Responsibility...   your friends should consider this. Sorry to be blunt. 
I have a couple of friends who had no technical know-how about Bitcoin, but based on my passion &amp; belief they decided to take a risk and bought 1 BTC each. I actually bought it for them, and they gave me the money - but what I then did, was go round their house &amp; help them out with Blockchain.info. It's easy really, but it's nice to have someone 'hold your hand'. Before I got there I told them to think of a 10 digit long password and write it down somewhere safe. 
I then showed them how to create a wallet, enable 2FA, set it so coins can only be moved with a *second* smaller password (inputted via an on-screen keyboard to thwart key-loggers). I then got them to set up 2FA on their email accounts (that's just bonus security anyway, not just for Bitcoin). 
When that was done I then got them to write down the 12 word mnemonic that Blockchain would ask you for to recover a wallet, plus a few other security items I can't quite recall - and then that's it, done. I know that all sounds tricky, but it only took 15 minutes or so and is well worth it in the long run. 
I am no computer expert &amp; I taught myself all of the above just from doing my own research and reading all the tips in the security pages of Blockchain.info - so if I can do it, anyone can. 
However, my advice to you, as their friend - is sit with them while they set up their wallet, talk to them &amp; explain what each feature is for - they'll learn much faster that way and then they won't lose their wallet or any coins. 
Blockchain makes it very clear upon sign up that if you lose your password, you LOSE YOUR BITCOINS. If that is not warning enough, I don't know what is. 
Blockchain.info has my trust for the reason that they themselves DO NOT HOLD MY PASSWORD OR PRIVATE KEYS - If you are saying 'upvote if you think this is a huge issue' then what you are saying the cure is, is for Blockchain to be able to email you your password if you forget it....   in other words, you want to 'trust' Blockchain to be a good custodian. Well, Bitcoin is all about **not requiring** trust. Learn that, my friend - or prepare to be Goxxed.

I merely saw some blatant trolling earlier this morning (there seems to be so many people on this sub that actively like to bash Bitcoin at every given opportunity - it's like a weird hobby for them) and since I rebutted somebody's clear negative bias, I've had a few other trolls come out of the woodwork &amp; continue with the attack.

Because that chart, is set to a logarithmic scale. It is useful to have when there is a large range of quantities. It is based on orders of magnitude. If you knew anything about statistics, you should know what a logarithmic scale is. 
Here's the thing; you are clearly a detractor of Bitcoin and for whatever personal motivation you take pleasure in bashing it. You've picked the price at it's peak and used that as your reference point to quote today's price against that high. Well, let's pick some other data points which are more meaningful - like say, the price today on October 17th &amp; then work backwards each year: 
* October 17th 2014: $383
* October 17th 2013: $175
* October 17th 2012: $11.50
* October 17th 2011: $4.40
This is why a logarithmic scale is useful - the jump from $4.40 to $11.50 may not seem much (what's 7 bucks, huh) - but percentage wise (+261%) that is equally as important as the rise from $175 to $383 (+218%) even though we like the +$208 difference more than the +$7 difference.  
So with increasing user adoption, VC investment, merchant adoption &amp; infrastructure growing in the Bitcoin space - Would you like to estimate where it will be next year on October 17th? 
Silly question to ask a troll though, you probably side with Professor Bitcorn's price prediction...

that part of the article is in a paragraph that starts with, 


and it links to an article titled *'why bitcoin will help stop warfare'*
And this is a genuine possibility, something Stephan Molyneux puts forward in this awesome talk in Amsterdam: [Bitcoin vs Political Power](
He explains how WW2 simply would not have been able to happen, had we stayed on the gold standard. There was not enough gold in the world to fund WW2. If Bitcoin went mainstream in the future, war would only happen if mass public consensus allowed it to happen - not a corrupt government creating money from thin air to fund the war machine.

like the other posters have said - Supply &amp; Demand.  
If demand for Gold stays the same (or rises) and then less of it is available (because you destroyed some) - then supply has dropped.   If demand outstrips supply - prices rise. 
Just look at property in London - there is only so much of it, yet demand is high = prices sky-rocket upwards

I'd like to know what technology you're comparing Bitcoin to, to consider it mediocre? Can you watch [this]( and seriously tell me Bitcoin has no worth? 
Also, what is mediocre about these price points?: 
* October 17th 2014: $383
* October 17th 2013: $175
* October 17th 2012: $11.50
* October 17th 2011: $4.40
$4.40 to $383 in three years is far from mediocre!

I doubt it will be international - and there's a £250 daily limit on transfers by the looks.  Also, it doesn't say anything about it being free to use - so they'll probably be charges somewhere in that.  So yeah, Bitcoin remains superior!    
My only concern was that if this took off among the UK public (those who have no interest in BTC at all) - it might get a big enough foothold &amp; users of this could say 'why would I want to use bitcoin, when this works just fine on my mobile phone?'   (and the association to the current banking system would give it a perception of legitimacy)

The way I look at Bitcoin's value is this - think of a network of actual physical conduit or pipes that stretch all over the globe, connecting every country together. Just like a big spiders web, stretching everywhere. Now fill this network of tubes with 21 million coins which can move around the pipes &amp; tubes - and that is 21 million that can never increase. This network is highly efficient, quick &amp; a low-cost way of transferring value from one country to another. 
Put that aside for now, and contemplate that the foreign exchange market averaged $5.3 trillion per day in April 2013 (referenced from [here]( All this money is currently moving around the globe through inefficient &amp; archaic systems, that take a long time to process &amp; charge exorbitant fees.
When the mainstream global population start to learn about Bitcoin, experiment with it, trust it - and the digital infrastructure is put in place (that is easy for laymen to access &amp; use to send money abroad) - then it will become a simple choice for the consumer; pay more in fees &amp; wait longer, or pay less and have money sent instantly...  
Now let's go back to my analogy of the network of tubes &amp; pipes carrying the fixed supply of 21 million coins. If more and more money was wanting to use this efficient, low-cost and QUICK money transfer method - then it is right to say that in order to 'squeeze' this larger amount of money through this fixed size bitcoin network - then the larger in value each of these 21 million 'conduit-coins' needs to be....  It's as simple as that in my mind.
If Bitcoin captured just 1% of the FX market, a single coin would have to be worth about $25,000. If we captured 4% of the FX market then we are looking at $100k per coin can we get to a million per coin with 40% of the FX market...? that may be doubtful based on the FX market alone - but we haven't even considered the following: 
* Total derivatives market: [$632 trillion]( (December, 2012) 
* Global bond markets: [$100 trillion]( (March 2012)
* Global Remittance market: [$608 billion]( (Estimated for 2015)
So if we look at all of the global markets together &amp; contemplate just how **huge** our current monetary system is...  Then is $1million per Bitcoin feasible? Well, I'm biased like the rest of you, but given time for the world to become educated in Bitcoin, then I'd like to think so!!

if you are from the UK &amp; you have online banking (with Faster Payments) it's really quite easy. Either use localbitcoins.com or bittylicious.co.uk - with both of these you are paying a slight mark-up above trading sites, but you do get your bitcoin straight away, without having to send ID in to be verified etc. 
They will limit the amount of BTC you can buy with your first purchase - and then 24 hours later you can buy more. This is to establish that you are legit. 
*edit - both options above are using online transaction - not meeting up with anyone face-to-face to trade. They both use Escrow services, so you can rest assured that sellers will not screw you over &amp; not send you BTC once you've paid.

I'm sorry to hear about your loss, OP. That sucks big time. 
Hindsight is a wonderful thing...  but for anyone else reading this who has a blockchain.info wallet - you really need to set up the following, at the very least: 
* 2FA on your email account which contains your blockchain.info email log-in link
* 2FA on blockchain.info itself
* a main password having at least 15 characters long (non-dictionary words preferable)
* use the option blockchain.info offer of having a secondary password for moving coins out of your wallet. This is entered by mouse clicks through an on screen keyboard display (ie can't be key-logged). If your account is compromised at least the attacker can't send coins elsewhere. 
All of the above can be found &amp; activated by spending a few minutes looking through the security settings page, once you're logged in.

People shouldn't get distracted by discussing the merits of taxation as an idea. It's irrelevant - what is relevant is a blanket, cover-all, sweeping power created by the government to raid ordinary peoples bank accounts, without consent. Period. This is absolutely shocking - think about it, you could be a vocal opposition to the government, an anarchist perhaps and with these powers you could have your account emptied on bogus suspicions of 'tax irregularities' and you'd be months &amp; £££'s in legal fees to appeal. It's complete bullshit &amp; proves exactly why we need personal privacy &amp; financial independence, something Bitcoin is now offering us.

I've said it before and I'll say it again - this could be absolutely huge for Bitcoin!  Pokerstars have annual revenues of 1.1 billion &amp; they're now trying to open the door to more customers in India &amp; China - if Bitcoin can help bridge that gap, well, the mind boggles...  
Even for their current user base, there is now an alternative deposit method which eliminates having your bank statement littered with deposit records to a gambling site. These transactions can go against you for credit checks when applying for a mortgage or loan. 
I am a frequent player on Pokerstars &amp; will certainly be using Bitcoin should this become a reality. Withdrawals currently take 3-5 business days to clear - but with Bitcoin it should be just a few confirmations on the blockchain. I love it!

PocketFives run a leaderboard &amp; ranking system for players who are registered on their site. Based on your recent tournament results you get points allocated depending how well you do, and these give you a ranking based on your city / country / world.  
As tournaments run 24/7 the points system needs constantly updating. I don't know much about website maintenance, but I guess it's so they can snyc data between a database &amp; the site, periodically on a 24 hour basis....

Here's 1500 bits @_date: 2014-03-10 09:17:21
my Moronic Monday question:   For Bitcoin to go mainstream &amp; start becoming a normal way to pay for goods &amp; services (in particular in a big retail shopping mall) - Does anyone else see basic internet connection as an obstacle? 
The reason I ask, is that I was recently in a big shopping centre here in the UK &amp; whilst stood waiting in a long queue to pay, I took my phone out of my pocket to check emails/facebook &amp; noticed that I had absolutely no signal at all. There are other parts of the shopping mall where I do get signal, but certain shops it's dead. So it got me thinking, how would this work if someone wanted to pay with Bitcoin... I imagined them eventually getting to the cashier after a long wait &amp; then pulling their phone out to pay &amp; seeing no signal. I guess the obvious answer would be that the store invests in free WiFi - but with an impatient queue of customers waiting behind you, how practical is it to hold everyone up while you scan, connect &amp; enter the store's wifi password... and can we expect an older generation of non-tech-savvy clientele to do this when they come to pay?  I was just thinking along the lines that in most of the western world we take 3G/4G phone signal for granted...    
@_date: 2014-05-08 07:02:17
This sounds stupid that I hadn't already thought of it - but I use facebook regularly &amp; post any good Bitcoin links I come across or beginners guides etc..   But it's just occurred to me, if  I'm keen to share Bitcoin with non-Bitcoin people, then the best way is to simply start tipping on facebook!   I can still tip on facebook, right? 
*EDIT* - Facebook coming soon...   (dammit, I want that facility now!)

I love how dickwads like you take the high road &amp; think short term blips in price override 1,000's of man hours of innovation. The price charts now are just noise, with a couple of years more in fine tuning of innovation &amp; killer apps being developed - little small minded douches like you will switch to being the noise. Leave your ego at the door, constructively demonstrate to us how Bitcoin is not a good technological invention / payment network - or STFU &amp; GTFO

I know, right !!  My $ average price is now $542 - and that varies from a high of 630 &amp; a one-off low of 400.  My first ever purchase was just after a 'China bans bitcoin' crash around mid December - I consider that quite lucky with hindsight - due to the euphoria of November's run-up I nearly bought in on the drop at around $800 if I remember rightly... 
$540 is a good average though - Hopefully I will have no cause for complaint in 10 years time anyway!  ;)

even more interestingly in a demographics point of view - it was a female. 
I'm also friends with her boyfriend - me &amp; my girlfriend have been friends with this couple for a few years now, and through various social occasions they've listened to me talk about Bitcoin - and my impression was that the boyfriend warmed to the idea more, whilst the girlfriend was very dismissive. She would say it doesn't make sense, and that it's not 'backed by anything' etc etc...  
I was half expecting the boyfriend to ask the question first about buying one! Although I expect he may now follow suit. 
I asked her "what made you want to buy one?"  and her response was interesting - she said to me: *"if I'm honest, I still don't know how it all works but you seem to have done your research, so I trust you and I like to take a chance on these things"*
So this isn't so much about a particular feature that's impressed her, or a certain news story - instead this can simply be attributed to 'fear of missing out'. It's a speculative punt that if Bitcoin takes off in a big way, she'd rather be involved than watching from the sidelines. 
I've always, always stressed to friends that it's risky &amp; could go to pot, therefore don't invest what you can't afford to lose - so if she's cool with that - then 'welcome aboard' is what I say!

I haven't lost anything... because I haven't sold any. 
Until I liquidate my position, the daily price is moot to me. Bitcoin has always been a high risk / high reward long term investment. It either crashes to zero, or pays off big time. I have not put in more money than I can afford to lose - and only after at least 10 years will I be evaluating this investment as being good or bad. 
It baffles me that we have such a new, exciting technology and people are so stuck on short term immediate gains.

Pills have been pressed with all kinds of logos for years now. I remember a decade ago at least, that blue Mitzibushi's were the ones to get. There's since been pressings with logos from McDonalds, Playboy, Sky, 007, Motorola, Adidas, Volkswagen &amp; Armani, to name but a few. If Bitcoin has now been included within this sub-culture I struggle to see how this is bad! Are any of the brands I just listed damaged specifically for having a pill pressed with their logo? I don't think so....

I'm sorry for tipping so small, my intention was more about the concept &amp; utility of sending value (regardless of size) directly from one person to another, through the internet.

Ah ok, thank you. Another quick question; if you generated a BIP38 encrypted private key, is it not the case that you could potentially expose this private key &amp; without a bad agent knowing your BIP38 passphrase, the encrypted private key is as good as useless to them?

why is it 'shitty' ? 
Because you don't like seeing the progress Bitcoin has made since it's inception? You can't argue with facts I'm afraid, not matter how hard you troll. 
You obviously like to pick your price reference point from the high point last November - that's fair enough. Haters gonna hate. 
Unfortunately for you haters, the fact is we can take today's price and then go back each year &amp; see the following: 
* October 17th 2014: $380
* October 17th 2013: $175
* October 17th 2012: $11.50
* October 17th 2011: $4.40
$4.40 to $380 in three years is certainly not 'shitty'

Pokerstars are  in the online poker industry, and symbiotically  when it comes to integrity, compliance &amp; trust. Their reputation means everything &amp; as a consequence I believe they will be just as strict on which markets they currently operate in. They've had to jump through so many hoops to get to where they are today, they're not going to throw it all away just to jump on the bitcoin bandwagon. 
In other words, they do their own KYC checks regardless of the deposit method you use. If you live in the Netherlands and the Netherlands has banned Pokerstars from operating there, then they're not going to turn a blind eye to their customers location &amp; just say "oh well they deposited with bitcoin &amp; therefore we don't care where they're located"  It should just be business as usual

I think that could be pretty awesome!!
 
I imagine a platform where it lists all of the day's sport - and against each result (let's keep it simple and go with your suggestion of either Win - Draw - Lose) it offers a range of odds.
A customer sees that Team-A vs Team-B has odds available of 5/1 that Team-A wins, you like it - and send X amount of bitcoin to a unique address. This leaves the bet as 'open' until another customer comes along, sees that somebody wants action at 5/1 for Team-A to beat Team-B &amp; thinks 'hell no can Team-A win!' - I'm gonna take those odds against him for Team-B to win...  he then sends the appropriate amount of bitcoin to a different address - and the clever part of this site will be an escrow service to hold the coins until the game is finished, then a 3rd party (using multi-sig technology) releases the coins to the winner.....   A customer could even offer up their own odds and lay bitcoin against them - it's just a case then of someone liking the look &amp; taking them up on it. 
Could be huge!!   All decentralized &amp; anonymous too, of course! 
I guess it would be like Betfair (the current UK gambling site where it works peer to peer)

The closer we get to March 11th the higher chance of approval. 
Historically, the SEC never actually reject ETF's - rather, they give the applicant the chance to withdraw in the late stages. 
And some speculate that they also won't'approve' the COIN ETF, because the SEC would be seen to be 'backing' it (or endorsing it. So potentially what might happen is they will let it run to March 11th where it is approved by default, rather than an explicit approval... if that makes sense.  
So yeah, closer we get; the better it looks!

So here is a newsflash for you - if you haven't sold, you haven't lost anything. The only thing you have lost, is your patience. 
Again, if you have speculated with more than you can afford to lose, and/or thought you would double your money in a year - then your expectations were unrealistic to begin with. 
What you have instead done, is create a thread declaring to everybody "Bitcoin is dead - it will **never** see $500 again" - like you are some kind of known authority on the subject. All you are doing is intentionally spreading Fear Uncertainty &amp; Doubt (FUD) &amp; for that sir, makes you the POS

you would only make a loss if you liquidate your position. 
Tell us, why on earth did you sell in a bear market?? you should HODL.
So, which of the following applies: 
* [ ] You thought Bitcoin was a get-rich-quick scheme
* [ ] You speculated with more $$$ than you can afford to lose
* [ ] You're a troll who is lying, and never invested 30k in the first place

Technically, the bitcoin that you talk of sending, is not really moving - it sits on the blockchain &amp; the keys to authorize spending are transferred. 
Here's a thought; If I create a brain wallet sat on my home PC &amp; then I fly abroad on holiday - I still know the phrase for my brainwallet, so have I technically 'moved' money overseas?

Register with a Bitcoin exchange that allows shorting.  Then;
1. Borrow an amount of Bitcoin from the exchange that you want to short sell. You have now entered a legally binding contract to borrow &amp; repay.
2. You immediately sell the Bitcoin that you have borrowed for fiat money.
3. Wait for the price of Bitcoin to fall (whilst paying a daily interest charge for everyday that you're still owing the exchange bitcoins)
4. When the price has fallen sufficiently, you use the fiat money that you are sitting on from selling the Bitcoin, to buy back the same amount of Bitcoin that you borrowed &amp; owe the exchange.
5. Give the exchange but the amount of Bitcoin that you borrowed. Profit from the difference. 
Example;  You borrow 10 btc (when the spot price is $1,000 per coin).  you immediately sell them and have $10,000 in your exchange  account - and you now owe 10 btc. 
You wait for the price to drop to $800 per Bitcoin. You now use the $10,000 in your Exchange account to buy 10 bitcoins. $800 x 10btc = $8,000.  Therefore you have  $2,000 left over. Pay the exchange back the 10 bitcoins that you borrowed &amp; keep $2,000 for you. 
But remember, there are lending fees whilst you still owe bitcoins - the biggest danger is that the price of bitcoins rise and does not fall.  In which case you will be forced at some point in time to buy back the 10 bitcoins but at the higher price - thus losing money.

No worries! Glad it helped. What you are describing above is a strategy that some traders refer to as 'buying the dip'.  I have a basic understanding of trading, but I've yet to start trading myself! So my knowledge is limited somewhat. 
But you could use that strategy on any bitcoin exchange, such as bitfinex, gemini, bitstamp, coinfloor, bitmex, okcoin etc etc
You can set 'buy orders' &amp; 'sell orders' to perform these actions automatically.  Eg when price hits '$1,150 buy 1btc' &amp; @ '$1,275 sell 5btc'  -  you then carry on with your life and when those price points hit the actions are carried out

They mention gold as a physical commodity you can take hold of, yet fail to mention the paper gold market is completely over-sold... ie there are more ownership certificates issued than the total amount of gold out there. 
Certain countries can't even inspect their gold that's stored in the Federal Reserve, yet alone repatriate it to their own country - so good luck retrieving your gold if you bought it through the stock exchange!!

I've never used Coinbase myself, but I guess if it's just slightly lower than market value, that's how they make their money...  They are effectively working as a broker. In other words, you don't have to register on an exchange to buy bitcoin - they are offering an easy to use, bitcoin purchase &amp; storage facility. 
I don't think Coinbase would be considered an exchange, like Bitfinex or Bitstamp etc
If you decide to trade, I would suggest checking out one of those exchanges I listed in my previous reply - and no, you don't need a full bitcoin to trade with. You can definitely work in fractions of a bitcoin (although some trading sites may have minimum quantities, I don't know) - but certainly not whole bitcoins. 
If you have any questions about trading - I recommend you visit [BitcoinMarkets]( and read up on the posts in there &amp; ask questions. I read that sub probably more than r/bitcoin these days. Ask questions &amp; get involved, they're generally pretty friendly &amp; helpful

You do have control of the private keys - you should have been given a 12 word backup of your wallet. If you haven't backed up your wallet do so now, you can do it once you've logged in.
If you lose your password blockchain. Info cannot recover it for you - they do not hold your passwords and therefore do not hold your private keys. It's all done on the client side of the web browser.
For more reassurance, [read this](

I like the idea of free money - but I'm not so keen on inputting my 12 word recovery seed into a website that I don't know or trust....

I have a cunning plan....   if you were to use the tool today the balance of your wallet is irrelevant for today's date - the important thing will be the balance of your wallet at the date and time of the chain split.... right?  This new wallet will only credit equivalent bitcoin cash for that point in time.
So, before you do anything create a brand new blockchain. info wallet and move all your existing bitcoin into this 'safe wallet'.  
Now use your original wallet ( which now has a zero balance) - and follow the steps in the block and you can happily submit your 12 word seed because even if it was compromised and malicious actors were involved - they only have access to a zero balance wallet....   but the new bitcoin cash tool will be able to track your transaction history and identify your wallet balance at the time of the coin split....  hence, you should get some free bitcoin cash credited &amp; you're original Bitcoin balance is protected in a new wallet the only you know the security phrase for...
If anyone can see a flaw in this please let me know

There is a good lesson to be learnt here. I fall guilty of having a few ideas and then rarely acting on any of them. 
A friend of mine is a digital project manager &amp; he works with big companies in developing their web pages etc - he told me something similar with regards to making an app. Basically,  you just have to **do it**. Stop talking about it - and just get it built. You won't get it right first time - and you will need patience. But follow through on your ideas &amp; you never know, one of them could be a success.  
Don't be that guy that sees an app or a program that has been created &amp; say " I had a similar idea for that once"

My personal guess (as a hodler from late 2013) - break $1,000 by new year...  then a retrace as bag-holders who bought high  sell off and take profits...  drop to high 800's or 900's - then consolidation and up again to $1,600 or so by summer 2017.

If you leave your coins in coinbase, you are effectively trusting them to look after them and not steal them.  whilst it is highly unlikely that they will steal them - it is always more prudent to take your own responsibility for Bitcoin.

and all of this infrastructure they plan to build on the Blockchain, is secured by the computational power of miners... and miners mine when profitable to do so. Therefore Bitcoin needs to hold / increase it's value, right?

This is a great quote from the article:
"Digital Asset’s goal, Ms. Masters said in an interview, is to build a bridge between the emerging digital-currency industry and Wall Street. It would apply the decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange system and the “immutable” digital-ledger technology that powers bitcoin to shake up the old, centralized financial model, with its “dated infrastructure,” multiple intermediaries and settlement delays, risks and costs, she said. But it would also retain the audit trails, credit limits and other checks and balances that help secure that traditional system, she said. 
“If you can find a way to bridge the two of them then you have something that is truly revolutionary,” Ms. Masters said, calling it “the financial challenge of our time.” 
If successful, she added, **it could take the market for bitcoin,** with its capitalization of around $5 billion, and extend the model to mainstream financial assets such as secondary corporate loans or private equities, where the size runs **into the trillions of dollars**."
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:28:22
But it doesn't all start at $2,000....    the first millionaires who move into the market will start to push the price up. If it becomes popular among the rich and fashionable to own a Bitcoin, it becomes a race not to be the last person to acquire some. Theses are probably more concerned about keeping face at a dinner party...
So if you are a millionaire and you buy today at 2000 - who knows where the price will be when the last of the millionaires are trying to get on the train...  certainly not 2000
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:00:32
So you can effectively trade using your Circle account? Or do they tweek the exchange rate to suit them? 
example - you hold 1.0 BTC with Circle and today decide exchange to USD and you now hold $249.50 (Exchange rate at the time of writing).  Give it a few days and Bitcoin does what Bitcoin does, dropping in value to $240...  So you now decide to switch from USD back to Bitcoin, so $249.50 / $240 per coin = 1.0396 BTC and you've made a profit....

Just look at it as a centralized banking system (under the control of large banks &amp; government) are using Bitcoin as a tool. In this case, for settling inter-bank transfers, immediately. 
If we consider the fact that we know the banking sector is toxic, the question is 'does it corrupt or destroy Bitcoin as a technology?'  I think the answer is No. 
Bitcoin is a tool for everyone &amp; covers many applications. From migrant workers sending money back home, to irrefutable storage &amp; time-stamping of digital deeds &amp; assets, to the Internet of Things (machines using Bitcoin as a language) - to big banks moving money between themselves....    The whole point is that it is free to be adapted by whoever, it does not discriminate &amp; no-one is a custodian of saying who gets to use Bitcoin tech. So for that reason, I would not worry about big banking using bitcoin as a tool

Holy fuck that's a pretty earth shattering concept to get my head around....

I'm probably being very naive here, but before I get too excited there's something I wanna know;  As I understand it the Winklevii ETF plans to buy coins &amp; hold them as more money goes into their ETF....  Well does Barry Silbert's do the same?  Because I read it as the fund works by tracking the bitcoin price fluctuations. I want to know if Silbert's fund will CAUSE the fluctuations by buying up coins.
In other words, if you're an investor &amp; hold shares in this, your share value increases by btc rising from 250 to 300 - like you're watching and betting on the btc market from the sidelines without actively affecting the price yourself

I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious...

This is a great quote I've read this morning from Blythe, about DAH:
"Digital Asset’s goal, Ms. Masters said in an interview, is to build a bridge between the emerging digital-currency industry and Wall Street. 
It would apply the decentralized, peer-to-peer exchange system and the “immutable” digital-ledger technology that powers bitcoin to shake up the old, centralized financial model, with its “dated infrastructure,” multiple intermediaries and settlement delays, risks and costs, she said. But it would also retain the audit trails, credit limits and other checks and balances that help secure that traditional system, she said. 
“If you can find a way to bridge the two of them then you have something that is truly revolutionary,” Ms. Masters said, calling it “the financial challenge of our time.” If successful, she added, **it could take the market for bitcoin,** with its capitalization of around $5 billion, and extend the model to mainstream financial assets such as secondary corporate loans or private equities, where the size runs **into the trillions of dollars."**

Not really because the people who moved first would be seeing handsome returns and that would fuel the greed for other investors to jump on in time
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:28:22
Haha, no - but the action seemed to happen when I was sleeping.   I shouldn't get too used to seeing my price ticker widget on my phone showing over +100 gains each 24hr period.... but damn it feels good to be a hodler

I'm gobsmacked.... The BBC have done a positive article on crypto!?

and this is why I love Bitcoin...   Innovation without permission. Bitcoin offers us all such an amazing platform to develop, create, improve...  
I may not have the awesome idea you guys all come up with - but I love reading about them on this sub
Here's $1 on me! Keep innovating :D  @_date: 2015-03-11 10:20:00

I actually like that they have put some rationale behind the guesstimate, with regards to network growth and current average bitcoin held per person. I know it is still pie in the sky but at least they have made an attempt

I'm honest to god not trying to troll, I just checked the charts on a 10-day window (hadn't looked for a while since the New Year) and was like... Oh. :-\

I think you're missing the bigger picture here...  it's all to do with the average Joe's perception of bank security. If digital heists like this continue, then public confidence may be shaken so much that alternatives that were never previously considered, all of a sudden...  are. 
The word 'encryption' has started to enter the general public domain, after the iPhone/FBI saga &amp; Whatsapp refusing to provide a 'back-door' to their software. 
If the public associate with 'encryption = strong security'  and then start seeing traditional digital banking systems getting hacked more &amp; more often....   then it won't take long before the penny drops;  'banks = weak, bitcoin = strong'
