I'm holding. I started buying a year ago and have bought at many price levels, averaging $414. I plan to hold on.

Yeah, he was trying hard to be "cute". (I guess that's what toss bag might mean.)

Taxation is theft. It doesn't matter what costumes the gunmen wear or what they write down to justify themselves.

Let's try again. 2000 bits I think my accounts are linked now.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:38:03
I linked first to my Twitter account, now I'm attempting to link to this account. Sorry, I'm learning.

I like it too. 500 bits @_date: 2014-11-04 22:04:27
OK. Sorry. I didn't answer your question directly. But I did respond to what I thought was impied by the question.
Yes, I can deny that taxation is necessary. There are many great ideas out there on how voluntary societies have worked and can work. I hope you will look into it. See Murray Rothbard's "For a New Liberty". David Friedman's "The Machinery of Freedom". Search: dispute resolution organization (DRO). The Mises Institute.  Others.

Go ahead. Make one. Competition is a powerful thing.
@_date: 2015-01-30 15:36:58
Yes. I agree because I'm for peace and prosperity.
Stop the wars and war mongers.
Stop the blowback and backdraft.
Bitcoins not bombs.

Is that .com???  ??? Or is it .org???
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:33:33
What do you mean? Where can we read your explanations?
@_date: 2012-12-21 14:58:59
Thanks for the feedback. I'll "carry on". And thanks for what many of you are doing to build this thing.

I will run it all day sometimes. I have a long time practice of shutting down the home desktop computer daily and going outdoors to garden, hike and play (often with podcasts or audiobooks playing in my one good ear) Then I cook, eat and read books or watch movies and sleep.  I think that daily shut down reduces the coal burning at the power plant. If I need to check my email at night, I turn on the "netbook" for a bit.

I'm waiting for mine and transplanting lettuce in GA US.
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:23:46
...and you were there. You saw it all.

I may be forced to pay to stay out of jail. But it ain't right. 
(Coercion is wrong. See the Voluntarists for more.)

Yes, I meant that. Thanks. We all need to learn about the "Austrian School of Economics".
