Did you reset your password in the last day?  When you reset your password, there is a 48 delay on withdrawals.   In any case, put your ticket number here and we can look into it more.

You forgot to mention a ticket number.

We didn't 'steal' anything.   Our WDC hot wallet is currently being upgraded.   Once the upgrade is complete, then they should show up.

I have been advised by our DDOS provider that they are currently in the process of patching their servers to the latest OpenSSL version.  BigVern

It's a long chain download, but we should have it back online sometime tonight.  BigVern

Noted.   I will start posting more to as well as monitoring.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:47:58
All updated on our servers as well as our DDOS providers servers have been completed.

Well, when you have two guys you don't know unexpectedly come to you with a microphone and a video recorder it tends to make you a little nervous.

In regards to samgeneric's visit.  While we do invite users to visit, it's appreciated if you let us know ahead of time.  ;)   BigVern

I'm pretty sure you already know the reason.   Thats all I will say.  BV

One thing to note on Cryptsy is that you are actually looking at the SSL certificate of our DDOS provider, as no user actually connects directly to our servers.   Therefore a hacker would not be able to view the memory contents of our servers, but instead of the DDOS proxy.   I have notified our DDOS provider about this urgent issue.   BigVern

If you guys have open tickets with issues, then post the ticket number.  I assure you it will be looked at.   drk wallet appears fine on our end, could be some other issue causing your delay.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:30:48
Opening additional tickets does not help either.  You need to address the original issue.

This is not the Cryptsy support channel.  I suggest you provide the information which was requested from the original account you setup.   Once this is done, both of your accounts will be free to do as you with.    There are reasons we ask for things, if you ignore these requests and think blasting social networks will bypass these requests, then you are mistaken.  BigVern

Zyxxer,   
I want to personally thank you here for doing the right thing.  At Cryptsy we not only want to build a great exchange, but we want to build a community of trust.  Actions like this only serve to strengthen that community bond.   
As a community we want to ensure we are seen in the best possible way, especially since many people out there have no idea what Bitcoin is.   I've had many conversations about Bitcoins that have started like: "Oh Bitcoin, that is like the Silkroad drug stuff, right?".  The more positive light we can shine on bitcoin, then more acceptance there will be.  The ultimate goal here would be that everybody accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment.
I feel you should be rewarded for your actions, and will be contacting you directly to arrange for this.
On another note, I wanted to tell the community that we have not only corrected the issue, but we have put additional measures into place to prevent this from happening again.  These additional controls, for the most part, should not noticeably affect your transaction speeds.
Paul Vernon
Cryptsy CEO

This is being fixed.   BigVern
