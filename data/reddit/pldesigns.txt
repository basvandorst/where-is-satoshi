Of course the majority of the assets will be in things other than cash but those things are usually stocks and other investment which directly correlate to the value of USD. Of course there are things like land and property, I’m not saying they need to put 10% of their net wealth in or anything but a small diversification makes sense at this point.

That’s absolutely true but any assets that aren’t physical (like stocks and bonds) are directly affected by the value of the USD.

Wait where is the link?

Really though if you don’t believe these magic tokens have any threat to fiat currency then what are you actually doing here?

Honestly, not necessarily

I'm not sure you understood the statement?

This thinking does not make sense. If fiat in fact crashes so hard it eventually becomes worthless like many people believe. HOW will you go about getting BTC then? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:28:46
It's absolutely different. Fiat's value is established via it's purchasing power. BTC's value is established via it's purchasing power in relation to it's tie to Fiat. If this was not the case, nobody would care if BTC "goes to the moon".

so who facilitates that transaction once all 21 million BTC are mined and the only incentive is transaction fees? Also at that time, you would have to have so much processing power to do so that it would inherently centralize everything which is already happening with large mining operations. (I'm not trying to hate on BTC, I'm heavily invested myself but am in group 2. I just am trying to figure out how the group 3 scenario would actually work)
