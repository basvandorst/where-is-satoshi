That‘s clear. Just saying that currently there are enough people ready to pay high fees.
If those that don‘t transact (or get backlogged in the mempool because of a too low fee) adapt SegWit, it won‘t help much unfortunately. You need to get those whales to adapt that pay high fees, to give others more space. And that‘s not easy...

We were talking about businesses accepting payments and the false claim made by that there is no more risk involved for someone to accept payments on LN as opposed to accepting payments on-chain.
I can't imagine an online shop wanting to sign every payment they receive manually..


It's a huge difference. To receive on-chain payments you need exactly one public seed on your node computer. You can put your private key on the moon or elsewhere. During that you can generate as many new receiving addresses as you like and receive as many payments as you like, you're never required to use your private key until you want to spend anything.

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:35:22
I didn't say that. I said that "your private keys need to be on the live system". If you want to receive an on-chain transaction, the receiver doesn't need his private key to be on any system on the internet. On LN you need to have your private key on a machine on the internet at the very time that someone wants to send you funds
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:23:23
You don't want to close the channel because it's you who is paying the fee. And for the next payment you'd need to open a new channel, paying fees again. So that doesn't make much sense

What he meant is that your private keys need to be on the live system, because every time someone sends a payment to you, you have to sign your part of the transaction. This is fundamentally different from on-chain transactions, where all you need is a public address, while your private key could be in your safe in cold storage. No need to sign anything to receive transactions.

The manual thing will not work. It‘s called lightning because it‘s instant. You don‘t have to wait for block confirmations or worse, for the end of the business day for your payment to get through. Also your node can route other payments, and I don‘t think anyone supports a delay of more than a few seconds to get routed.
Well a hardware wallet could still help in the future I guess. So that the private key is isolated and can‘t leave the system, but the signing have to be automated. It can check that your really signing a LN transaction and nothing else. So a hacker can only hack funds if he has a channel open with you and can only steal those funds in that channel. Thinking about it, it‘s probably how it will be implemented by hardware wallets
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:18:56
I think so as well. LN can be the main network, while the blockchain is the security layer (court). In LN your money is freed, providing liquidity.
And I don't think the example with Bob and the coffee shop is accurate. Maybe if the coffee shop is Starbucks, then yes, but not the shop around the corner. The average Bob wants to open channels with nodes with high liquidity

Forgotten? I think it‘s the most talked about topic these days. At a scale, how can you have the system peer-to-peer while being able to use it like cash?
Now we have two systems, one that can still live up to the peer-to-peer term, but lost cash properties by having high fees at scale. And one that kept cash properties but, at scale, plans to loose peer-to-peer properties by not letting everyone run a peer.
None of those systems is the holy grail. But technical solutions are on the way (for both systems). And a lot of research is done.

A hw wallet gives no additional security. Unless you confirm all the transactions manually each time. But that would completely defeat the purpose of the lightning network. Lightning nodes relay transactions of others.


In LN you have to use the same address within a channel for all transactions, until that channel is closed. You won't generate or use any new addresses.

Yes. Mining has nothing to do with processing transactions. Mining is proof of work and therefore requires a lot of resources. On the LN there is no mining or proof of work involved, it's all smart contracts and route finding. It depends a lot on the network topology we'll have on mainnet at the time you're running your node to estimate how long it takes to find a route for a transaction. What will be the purpose of your node?


If a company runs a btc node to receive payments, it can keep all the private keys offline separate from that node. In case it gets hacked the hacker can find nothing. You can't do that with an LN node, because all the transactions are multisig and require you to sign every transaction, even if you're the receiver of a payment.

I don't think you'll need any particular performance requirements for that few transactions.
But again, the main effort will be to keep the node safe. When you transact 1M/day you'll probably have a few million $ in your channels. When a hacker obtains the keys for those channels he can gain access to those million $. And as a large node you will be a target

I highly doubt that. Bitcoin's adoption grows exponentially. So those blocks would be filled up immediately. That's my guess, I can't prove that though. Check out [this talk]( to see what level of scalability is envisioned.


There is no guarantee. And personally, I don't care much. Bitcoin is not a business. It's about changing the world and every coin that is participating in this research is helping to get there. So I'm excited what the future brings instead. What Bitcoin has though is the largest market cap combined with the largest hashrate. That makes it the most secure network in the world. That's where in my opinion the value comes from right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:05:17


That's true. Unfortunately I couldn't find a site that tracks propagation time currently. The data is outdated.


There isn't one because we have no blockchain operating across all cryptocoins that consistently produces blocks as big as 8MB


First you said *now*. But that's the point, we have solutions *on it's way* but, as always in tech, it takes more time than people hope.  


The only people that used bitcoin as a currency in this early stage were nerds. I doubt that they have trouble using something else like one of the forks or doge, or whatever, until we can scale for microtransactions.

[They started with a broken hash function that produced collisions]( in the first place, which was viewed as a rookie mistake in the crypto world. Seems like they fixed in though, but it speaks volumes about that tech.
Then there is the [33% attack]( and the requirement for a "coordinator" by the IOTA foundation. So it's far from decentralized. They claim that they can get rid of the "coordinator" in the future, but that's just a theory. So far IOTA is just an experiment. 
Edit: To read about just how bad IOTA's mistake is to implement their own hash function, [check out this writing by Bruce Schneier](


So the IOTA team just did that amateur mistake, had a serious amateur flaw in their hash function and when pointed out, just patched it. We should still consider IOTA's patched own hash function insecure. There is a reason why we should rely on functions that are checked by experts all over the world for years.

To mine a block with 0 transactions takes the same amount of time/work than to mine a full block. So mining effort is not dependant on tx count.

The advantage is to have one safe currency as base for all kinds of projects. If you build a small application on a coin or on a fork you’ll need enough users+miners to ensure decentralisation, security and the operation of the system. And then it’s hard to convince new users to use your project because of a weak unstable currency. Plus, users need to trust exchanges and use them to convert other currencies into the new one.
That’s why it’s good to have your project based on a robust system like bitcoin

Yes there are only a few consumer products which are open, but the tools of the "idealists" and "nerds" are very well relevant for everyone.  Linux is still dominating the web servers, although Microsoft gained market there. And: The internet is more or less open, no corporation took over and people bought it. One reason is because it's a global network. That doesn't mean that corporations don't build their own consumer products for that network. And in the future we might very well all (except for the idealists) use Google's Bitcoin wallet, because it's the fanciest and has the fastest routing for lightning, or whatever.

How are we running out of time? Bitcoin and the whole idea of decentralized money is still in it's very early stages, give it time. relax. And if you are a developer, contribute.
 But here is a thing that you may like or not: on-chain scaling is always only very limited. It's simply a physical reality. And unlike many believe, shouting at developers and demanding immediate solutions, doesn't change physics.
Look at the stats, it takes [5 seconds for a 1MB block]( to reach 1/2 of the network. With an 8MB that would be 40 seconds! You don't need to be an engineer to realize that 40s latency is a big disadvantage for a miner. We would have orphaned blocks again (blocks with 0 transactions) and less decentralization.
Solutions are underway for off-chain scaling and some great minds are working on it. again. relax.

When we talk about scaling we must define some goal. I think that the two sides of the block size discussions often simply have a completely different vision. BTC can handle around 10 transactions per second. Worldwide we have 100'000 transactions/s from credit cards alone. Then in China we have WeChat, [handling 200'000 tx/s]( and Alipay doing the same in peak hours. So it's safe to say that we have around 500'000 tx/s online today during peak.
But, do we just want to replace those traditional payment networks? Wasn't there a vision about microtransactions? I see a big future of microtransactions. And that would mean that the tx number would grow to ridiculously huge levels. Think at least 100 fold, if not 1000 fold. Think of a platform like reddit where with every upvote you tip the author 0.01$ or less. And think of video ads in youtube that can be skipped by clicking a button and paying 0.01$ every time you do. Every newspaper would switch to a more simple "pay per read" paywall which would actually work. All of this without requiring an account or giving away private information. Think of netflix and itunes with "pay per play". This will be huge. And it might only be the tip of the iceberg. We could stream money and pay TV per minute, pay a phone call directly per minute or second. In that case 1000 fold would be too conservative. But let's even just take the 100 fold number for calculations.
A blockchain handling 50'000'000 tx/s would require 5TB blocks. Saving 1 Petabyte of data per day is a challenge in itself, but you would also be required to run around 100 fiber internet connections in parallel with 1000Mbit/s just to be part of the decentralized network. But because of the block propagation time, which even today is a problem with only 1MB blocks, miners would need to download the 5TB block in less than 10 seconds to not be disadvantaged. So.. forget it. You can't run anything decentralized with such absurd requirements.
The blockchain doesn't scale.


The lightning network supports [onion routing]( to prevent nodes from censoring the sender or receiver of a transaction, by not knowing what the origin and destination of a transaction is. 


It's true that mining is a guessing game, but when two companies can mine more than 50% of the blocks and are governed by the same government it's still some degree of centralisation and censorship resistance is decreased. If the Chinese government would make it illegal to include certain transactions in a block, that won't destroy the miner's businesses, they would just ignore those transactions and include some other transactions from the mempool instead. For the transactor there would still be a chance that his transaction is included in the next block of a miner ouside China, but he would certainly feel the censorship in the delay and unreliablity of the network. 
On the Lightning network we can choose which nodes we open a channel to. If one node happens to reject transactions, we just close the channel to that node forever and open another one to a more reliable node.

Lightning can be implemented on Dogecoin as well, once they adopt SegWit. Dogecoin has much cheaper fees than BCH, so why is everyone talking about BCH as “competitor”? Just because of the name? We are paying high fees because enough people are willing to pay high fees. Yes it’s horrible for small transactions. But consider this: If we raised the blocksize to 8MB we would have filled up blocks again immediately. It’s because bitcoin is popular, the most secure network in the world, and has adoption. Most of the time BCH wouldn’t even fill up 100kbyte blocks. With 8MB blocks in a year bitcoin’s blockchain would grow 3x in size, filled again with satoshi dice roll transactions. Is that worth it? I don’t know. Bitcoin goes the conservative way and waits until real scaling solutions like LN are ready. Maybe then it’s time to raise the blocksize and do those dice rolls as Lightning transactions, as many as people want.

The important thing is that trust stays decentralised. We all know that the blockchain can't possibly scale for millions of transactions per second. Everyone talking to everyone is the worst form of communication. So for the network to scale, we need a different topology, and lightning can bring that. The blockchain's function turn into a security layer, think decentralised court system, which will be accessed in case of fraud on layer 2. 


No one is forced to open a channel with anyone. We can't tell yet how the topology will look like in production, it could very well be that big companies like Amazon, Ebay, Apple, Internet providers, Mobile providers etc. all have super big LN nodes operating. But I think there will be so many that we won't see centralisation issues. In fact, it will be almost certainly way less centralised than the BTC mining situation, where basically 2 companies in China have more than 50% power and can easily censor transactions. In addition to that, we have the advantage of improved privacy and anonymity, plus instant transactions without a confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:51:57
Throughput increase is only a side effect. More important is that SegWit solves transaction malleability, which allows LN in the first place. All kinds of on- on off-chain scaling solutions that we'll see in the future will rely on SegWit, including Schnorr

Hey Alex, I was wondering how your web wallet is implemented. Are the wallets virtual, meaning you just have 1 channel open for all wallets, or do the wallets each have their own LN channels? I'm asking because when creating a new wallet by opening the site for the first time, the balance is there instantly. Opening a new channel would require to at least wait for the next testnet block to be mined

@_date: 2017-12-31 11:12:40
Instead of opening channels for micropayments directly on the blockchain, you would join a group of nodes through a multisig transaction and then open, close and refund LN channels off-chain as many as you'd like. The groups are not disjoint sets but overlap by users being part of more than one group. That way inter-group communication/transacting is possible.
All in all it will make the whole channel opening and closing more flexible, instant and cheap and reduce load on the blockchain

I didn't deny that double spending won't happen. In fact, [it is happening]( What I'm saying is that it needs a serious amount of criminal energy to pull of a double spending attack in public and that the technical effort to do one is quite high.
Confirmations are needed to mathematically proof that the transaction was legit.
I don't know why we're even discussing these things. Just look at the example BitPay, they don't wait for confirmations, are in big business for years and have yet to experience a single double spending attack. I'm sure others are doing so as well (namecheap for example)

It usually takes a few seconds, if you have a reasonable internet connection. The attacker would need to run outside pretty fast.


You simply won't get away with it. A double spending attack is the pendant to scanning and printing dollar bills and requires a lot of criminal energy.
Also, if you want 100% security, a third party (VISA) can simply offer a service where you link your wallet with your personal details and then the merchant can require you to use such registered address. But I don't see the need for that. If you double spend, all of the security cams in the Walmart have already captured your face, police will investigate, together with the bitcoin address used. Walmart can take that small risk of losing a fraction of their money to criminals. It will be way smaller than credit card fees or lost money from stolen goods (stealing is way easier as they won't even recognise it).
If you are a small merchant and don't want to take risks, simply use a third party for the payments like BitPay (you can use it today for your PoS), they already do 0-confirmation transactions, all risks on them

why not? 2FA should apply to everything. 2FA just means that you have a two factors for authentication. Usually, one is a password and the second factor is something you own. So an appropriate 2FA solution would be to have the bitcoin-qt wallet stored on a usb stick, offline. Taking into account that more than 1500$ was in that wallet, this would be more than appropriate. You wouldn't walk across the city with that amount in your pocket, nor would you walk around with that virtually on the internet. It's as simple as that
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:31:14
Really? The first point is comparing apples to onions. Fact is, the verification of a credit card transaction usually takes 6 months, which is way longer than a bitcoin transaction.
Another fact, which most people here seem to get wrong, is that there is simply no reason for a merchant to wait for the verification of the bitcoin payment. The transaction is done almost instantaneous. The verification is just needed for the confirmation of the consensus in the network, to prevent a possible double spending attack. So the merchant just needs (an app) to listen on the network if the transaction was picked up and that's enough for almost any purchase (Of course, if you buy a house, you will probably wait the 10 minutes). If the buyer double spends his bitcoins on his bigmac menu, which is very very hard to do, it will appear pretty fast as a warning and the buyer will be exposed as a thief. 
Take for example BitPay, they already accept 0-confirmation transactions, which is why paying through BitPay is quite fast. And guess what, to date BitPay has experienced exactly zero double spending attacks. They take the risk, and you as a merchant should too, as that risk is way way smaller than the risk of for instance identity theft with a credit card.

Ok, I should be more specific. It really depends on the quality and the handling of the disc. It's important that you buy a new disc, that has been manufactured recently. Gold discs last the longest, also head for a phthalocyanine dye layer. Don't write anything on the disc and don't touch it's surface. Store them in a cool and dry environment, vertically oriented in a jewel case. Following these guidelines, your CD-Rs will last for decades, [if not centuries](
Also note that when your flash drive dies, probably everything on it dies. CD-Rs, however, degrade. So it's likely that some of the data is still readable if they went "dead". That's why you should write your keys many many times on the same disc

It was that yearly statement that all bank clients in Switzerland receive to send to the tax authorities. In Switzerland we have to pay wealth taxes, which depend on the amount of money you own. Now, as the authorities can't know how much money you have on your banks, as banks keep their data private, there is a tax called "Verrechnungssteuer", which is subtracted directly by the bank. Say you have 200'000 in your bank account and earn 3000 with it through an interest of 1.5%. The bank has to give 35% of that (1050) to the authorities. Now you send to the authorities your yearly bank statement and receive these 1050 back.
Of course you could evade taxes by not letting the authorities know about your bank accounts, but you'd also loose those 1050.

The last time men were on the moon was 40 years ago. The moon is 384,400km away, opposed to the mars which is 54,556,800km to 87,870,182km away.

However, the more you follow the huge marketing campaign around mars one the more you will notice how it's a complete scam. They are just pushing a big TV show and even get free support from the media. Everyone has heard about it, everyone will watch it when it airs. And if in the end the candidates are really supposed to actually go to mars, I don't think a lot will follow. They can simply back out from the whole thing and enjoy their fame, just like the big brother candidates.

So to me "virtual" applies well to bitcoin. I like to thing of bitcoin a direct replacement of cash, virtual cash. Of course, it's much more than that, but you won't find an adjective that describes all the features of bitcoin.

Transaction fees. They are not dependant on the transaction amount. So the lower the amount the higher the fees, nearing 100% for very low transactions

Every bitcoin client should display a warning whenever you store more than 1 BTC in it. It seems that it's difficult for people to understand that you should not carry around more money in your digital wallet than you would carry around in your physical wallet. It really IS the same. Your wallet should be used to spend money, NOT as a bank. So, if you buy some stuff on overstock, do that with your wallet on your computer. If you buy a car, open your hidden safe at home. If you lost your safe to a fire or if your paper wallets / CDs are somehow not readable anymore, you should have BIP38 protected copies of your wallets at a friend's place or somewhere else.
Also, don't use USB sticks. CD-Rs hold your data so much longer and more reliable, and are cheaper anyway.

No. CC payments are confirmed after months. During that period, the payer can charge back the payment, so the transaction won't be confirmed. If he doesn't charge back during ~3 months (depending on the bank), the transaction gets confirmed.

Investing because I think it will replace gold as a store of value. The whole "gold has value because it has so many uses" does not hold in my opinion. I've never seen someone hold gold and then sell it to someone at a higher price, who makes a necklace out of it. Most people just buy it for investment purposes.
Bitcoin has the same property of limited supply, but many advantages that gold doesn't have.
That's why I believe (and I don't force anyone else to believe it) bitcoin will grow to 300'000$/btc, where it surpasses the market cap of gold. And that's why I hold bitcoins. I'm very well aware that in 10 years it could as well be valued 0$, but I'm taking that risk

Correct. And for small transactions an additional layer can be built on top of bitcoin, the store of value. For small transactions, neither the consumer nor the merchant cares needs the level of security bitcoin provides. Also, I don't need the history of all 0.05$ chewing gum vending machine purchases of the entire world on my hard disk. I'm totally fine if such transactions are run by a service on top of bitcoin

Not sure about that one. Cash money is dying out, no matter if bitcoin is in play or not. The NSA can track all of your credit card, paypal etc. transactions anyway. Why make it more complicated? Also, the US profits by holding the world reserve currency, the USD and having it bound to oil. That country can print money as it likes without major inflation, as the currency isn't solely used within the country, it's the main trade currency of the global oil market and with that the main currency of the global economy

It means you would have 1btc on chain 1 and 1btc on chain 2. You can only send chain 1 bitcoin to another chain 1 adresses and only send chain 2 bitcoins to other chain 2 adresses. So yeah there will be two networks with different names and a war will break out about which chain will be named bitcoin and which has to take the loser name. Likely, both will continue with the name bitcoin and users will be confused.
The value of the bitcoins on the two chains will be different as they are two completely different currencies

Did you print that with a live cd linux? If yes, which printer did you use? I wanted to print them with ubuntu live, but have noticed that linux drivers suck hard. I have a brother dcp-195c. There are no drivers for it in ubuntu. So I had to download them from brother (Which is already a no go for me, as I want to keep the system offline for security reasons). But then, even with the official drivers, there was no fucking way to prevent printing in portrait! The application at Bitcoinpaperwallet.com requires you to print in landscape. Switching to landscape in the printer settings didn't help.
So, which printer works out of the box (offline) with a linux live cd?

The most revolutionary part to me is that with cryptocurrencies, for the first time, it's possible to transfer money wirelessly from A to B without ANY third party. VISA, MasterCard, etc. they all aren't needed anymore. And of course they'll fight against bitcoin with all of their billions of dollars. The fees of bitcoin transfers are at a fraction of the solutions available today. And nothing more than internet access is needed to receive (well, to confirm) payments. So any small business, even kids selling popcorn on the street, can accept bitcoins with ease.
Be it with bitcoins or with something else or with all of em together, cryptocoins will revolutionise many markets somewhere in the near future!

I love linux as a server OS or for certain programming, but as a desktop OS I think it's awful (my opinion). A MacBook is probably the most widely used hardware, and still, the driver support sucks. First, again the trackpad drivers, suck hard, worse than Windows. If I click down, the cursor moves. I cannot use it at all as I accidentally click the wrong buttons! Also, I don't want to visit the vendor's website to download printer drivers, I want an OS that configures this for me automatically. When I print my paper wallets, I have to connect to the internet first to print with my Brother DCP-195C.
How do you think a "closed mentality" is represented in Apple's Mac with MacOS? Apart from the Aqua UI most of the OS is even open source. I don't know what people mean when they talk about this closed thing, I have full root access to my system. And I don't care if the UI is not open, as it's very sophisticated and I don't want to customize it at all.
