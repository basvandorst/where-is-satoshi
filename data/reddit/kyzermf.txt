To be fair Jimmy Song is acting like a baby you can't use the introduction of the format to disparage your opponent and then play victim when they demand to defend themselves , him walking off just to return was very victim-y. He is playing on the dislike of Roger too much, doesn't play well for those who aren't on already on a side

This is even less meaningful in a language like Japanese with several potential meaning interpretations than in English, in which the meaning of "Brad" is also irrelevant.

Anything maximalism is socialism. More options, more competition, more development, it's what open source is all about.

Good post. If Bitcoin doesn't gain adoption, all the technology and hashrate in the world won't make it valuable.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:43:50


Good luck with that lol. How do you think people intend to make more BTC?

Well they are licensed custodians and insured so yes, they are so trusted that they would have to reimburse you if something happened by law.
But no you're right , suggest people remember their seeds by memory, that's definitely it

@_date: 2019-01-07 12:55:24
Nonsense. Exchanges run by humans that are being trusted with people's money should absolutely be regulated and licensed, regardless of how dumb the bitlicense debacle was specifically. Also complaining that their storage of other people's Bitcoin is regulated because no one should ever trust anyone with their private keys anyways is terrible logic.

Facebook is not just a website but ok? What's your point? The idea that Bitcoin has an insurmountable lead, is the only crypto worth existing, and that crypto developers have no choice but to work on Bitcoin because it has the metcalfes law traction of a small indie video game after 10 years is completely nonsensical. Being a protocol is an arbitrary and irrelevant excuse that changes nothing. There is no logic in maximalism. Sorry. It's socialist logic. Competition exists and is coming and is good for Bitcoin.  Those who don't think so are not only delusional, they are against the open source and free market nature of Bitcoin itself.

This is how trading of stocks works for a lot of consumer platforms as well
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:46:10
People are equally likely to dump free tokens as they are to buy more, if not more so. Also, how does this logic not apply to the early days of giving away Bitcoin?
Also your implication that giving things away without any necessary way to gain monetary value is a scam would basically infer that the only point of crypto is to get USD gains, which doesn't make sense.

People can pay their bills with what you are calling fake money, maybe the miners that hold up the network aren't idiots

With all due respect my good sir, what you are doing is called whataboutism. Pointing out how other things are worse than the thing being called out as an excuse for why it being bad is acceptable is what whataboutism is, not just pointing out a flaw in something.

Do you do this every time anyone says a phrase youve already heard before? 
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:05:24
Let me guess - you don't mine Bitcoin and you are trash talking about the people that support the network because you don't have to do it yourself. You think electricity is free? How do you get your Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:19:28
...and where did that Bitcoin come from, sir? You think because you are paid in BTC that it didn't cost electricity to make? It was mined, like every other Bitcoin in existence.
Take a step back from the fever dream, don't attack the people you are supposedly trying to "save". You cannot blame people for using Fiat whilst simultaneously acknowledging the early adoption phase we are in and hurdles we face today as well as in the future. Bitcoin today is literally incapable of scaling to global use (yet). This is reality. The sooner we come down off this cult madness and back to the obscene amount of work we have ahead of us the sooner we can get it done. Cut this superiority complex, others are plebian talk, down vote everyone who questions the king nonsense; stop making your entire personality and life about Bitcoin; and we can begin to make real progress away from this moonboi bs we are having to deal with.
