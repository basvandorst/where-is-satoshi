It probably won't really crash the game, but I just assume the game needs to end at some point to learn about how death feel, and bitcoin could be part of what's going to happen next and destruct all human life in that simulation (it could take 2000 years). It's why we don't remember what happened before we were born. and death probably feels the same. nothing.
What if there was a way to see this simulation from the outside ? How do you think you would need to pay to access that service ? with PayPal ?

There is no dip in FIAT currencies since governments never stop printing them.
The value of FIAT is being drained in a never ending hole.
You might buy a few Coins and Notes and keep them safe for a very very long time until it becomes a piece of collection and it will probably go up in value in 50 or 100 years when it becomes rare.

Of course, but what if the governments tell the private bankers "we will kill you if you don't comply" ? What's the difference between them printing money and the private bankers ? Do you think Private Banks tell governments to fuck off when being asked to print them money ?
When I say "print money" I mean entering 1 and a bunch a zeros on a computer. They don't bring them suitcases of cash of course. Cash will slowly disappear, only criminals will need to use cash as it is the only anonymous way to transact in the current (fiat) economic system.

Soros apparently invested in Bitcoin around April 2018 ([
So I believe he tried to pump Bitcoin shortly after in order to sell it back at a higher price and re-buy lower.
It's not really a bad thing because everyone know they would pump and dump Bitcoin if they had enough money to do it. But this is true for any type of assets. It just happen that it's easy to do it with Bitcoin because of it's tiny market cap.
At the end of the day, there isn't enough Bitcoin for every millionnaire in the world and people will soon realize it's a lot safer to hold bitcoin than paper that can be printed into infinity. It's not a matter of if, but when. and it will probably take some time to see a 1 million dollar bitcoin but it will get there and I have no doubts about that, even if it takes 20 years.
@_date: 2019-03-14 05:11:19

A lot of people are taking their money out of the banks as discretely as they can and it will cause something we are all waiting for in this sub. lol.

They should accept all cryptos and convert them into BTC at the time of payment. 
They should also offer a small discount when people pay directly in BTC. Or a freebie like getting a chance to smoke a joint with Elon Musk in person.

How do you type the Bitcoin and Litecoin symbol ?
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:16:49
My suggestion is this :
You write the seeds twice and separate each sheet into 2 :
\- from word 1 to 12 (you store in a bank vault)
\- from word 13 to 24 (you store in another bank's vault)
Then you store the other set of seeds at 2 different places in your house.
That way, if someone find your (half) seed in your house you still have the other half hidden somewhere else.
And if you house burn, you go to both bank's vault and get the seeds to recover your funds and buy a new house.
Also if the bank get robbed, the robber only get 12 words and he's screwed.
Of course if both bank get robbed or if someone come to your house and point a gun of your head, you are screwed but it's why you should not tell anyone how much crypto you own.
I just assume you can afford to rent a safe in 2 different banks if you need 4 ledgers to store your crypto.
But regardless, it's a pain in the ass to keep cryptocurrencies safe.

I didn't knew Trezor was open source.  I use both anyways.
But ledger support some shitcoins that trezor doesn't support.

I don't see deflation coming (maybe a few percent for a short amount of time but nothing significant).
You can't have deflation when you keep printing money.

When you see Bcash is still worth 150 bucks, sure Bitcoin will reach zero ... Keep dreaming.

Of course if it's not your bitcoin you should not be paying taxes on it.
The exchange should pay the taxes.
I think it's logical.

Only the holder knows if it’s a lost coin.

You can claim what you want, but saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin is like saying 1 Venezuelan Bolivar is 1 US dollar.
It's not counterfeiting. It's just being delusional.

Just shut your mouth and mine. It’s permissionless. Just tell them you are just doing mathematical calculations on your machine.

I think it's one of the best compromise between security and usability.
But it's not perfect for sure.
What do you think is the issue with the Ledger Nano S except the fact that someone skilled enough (assuming they have access to your device) could access your private keys ?

Good because I don't want to be part of the main economy.
At this point a big mac will cost 20.000$ and nobody will trust the main economy and they will likely accept your bitcoin.
I believe we will return to the age where we trade between each-other. I'm not only bullish on Bitcoin but also on Gold and Silver.
@_date: 2019-01-08 05:24:14
I believe we will get to the point where we will be able to buy a lambo for 1 bitcoin, but probably not this year or even the next one.
At some point, fiat money will lose most of it's value, therefore, 1 bitcoin will be worth a lot more USD (or EUR etc...) that it is currently worth.
The day 1 bitcoin will buy a lambo, the lambo will maybe cost 1 million dollars or more, and a 100$ bill might not be enough to order a Big Mac.
Also, if you drive around the city on your Lambo with a "BUYBTC" licence plate. You will probably have thousand of homeless people throwing stones at your car so you gotta be careful what you wish for.
However, I think it will happen regardless because our economy is a giant pile of garbage and it's falling apart rapidly.
If you invest in Bitcoin, be ready to HOLD for a couple of years and you might be very well rewarded. Don't buy into it if you are just planning to get a brand new lambo in 6 months.

I'm not worried about getting arrested because I don't do anything illegal. I just buy and hold for the future.
Also, you can get one of the safety box under someone else's name that you trust. Like a parent / grandparent or brother / sister / friend / etc. Since they only have 12 words, they could not steal your funds anyways.
There is always a way.

Do you think they will take our Bitcoin and give us paper money again ? How could they call it ? bitdollar ?

Bitcoin fees are about 30 cents right now. And they also accept Litecoin which has almost no fees (1 or 2 cents).
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:28:30
You don't need to wait 4 confirmations when you sell an ice cream. It would cost so much money to reverse a transaction that it would not be worth it for such amounts. 
If you accept Bitcoin to sell a lambo it's different, even tho the cost to reverse a transaction would be more than the cost of the car itself.

Human errors when storing crypto is unforgiving yes but thats the price to pay to have an asset that is unconfiscatable.
Your house, your bank account, your car and pretty much everything you own can be seized by the government if they decide to. If you store your private keys in a secret location that nobody knows about. No one can take them away from you.

Bitcoin is a digital asset, it's not a currency.
It can be as volatile as it wants.
Bitcoin is not about buying a coffee with your cellphone. It's about the freedom to do whatever you want with your money and it's unseizable.
