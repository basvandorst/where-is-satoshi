Solution found, it was the newly generated coin outputs after all. Original post updated. Also, minconf=0 behaved the same as minconf=1.

Yes, without the JSON syntax sugar of [""] I get the following error:
    /home/jesse/bin/bitcoind listunspent 1 999999 1SomeAddressInMyAccount
    error: value is type int, expected array
I interpret this to mean that it sees it start with a one, tries to parse it as an integer. Every argument is a JSON object, and help text clarifies third argument must be an array.

I would be happy to filter for my target address in post processing, but as the examples in my original self post show, listunspent without filters on the command line shows zero unspent outputs .. even though my fully functional address in this wallet (in an account that is not the main, unnamed account) obviously has a balance.
Another thought I just had: perhaps this is a side effect of the outputs being newly generated coin that haven't seen their 120'th generation yet? This address is one I use for mining proceeds, and my ultimate goal is writing a script to help automate distributing those evenly among miners in my experimental little pool. Even so, you'd think the "minconf=1" I explicitly state would allow them to be seen, even if they are not ripe for spending yet.
I guess I'll have an answer to that hypothesis within a day. It's just odd behavior no matter how you slice it though. :(

Well I do understand that accounts are a fictional accounting layer, but correct me if I'm wrong that layer is engineered as a way to group together bitcoin addresses, right? And then you can spend from an account and only inputs of addresses related to the account will be used, and change will flow back into same account without tainting other accounts or their addresses, right?
My speculation here is that the "listunspent" command may not function properly for any addresses not in the main (unnamed) account. If it did function properly, then it should list the unspent inputs that make up my 0.12345678 balance in account MyAccount address "1SomeAddressInMyAccount".
I'll take advise and try to pore over the code in Github as time permits, hopefully it's not too dense for me to mentally parse. But if you've any further insight that would also be welcome. Thank you. :)
