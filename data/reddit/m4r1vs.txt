14% in 24 hours is every stockholder's wet dream and definitely not nothing. And I LOVE it, because my Wealth increases. These huge fluctuations are a sign that bitcoins are used to day-trade and make profit, not to buy stuff what a currency is for...

Hey, if you guys come up with something, no matter how it looks like for now, feel free to throw your concepts into an [issue]( on GitHub so those concepts can be discussed over there (much more convenient than reddit) :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:35:23

Hey, it would be really nice if you could suggest your idea of using Xamarin instead of React-Native again on the GitHub page I created. Just use [this]( link and click "new issue" :) That way I can better keep track of all suggestions
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:21:01
Yeah, I have to admit that I don't quite get everything yet, but this video explains a lot: 
edit: I haven't read it yet, but I am sure the white paper contains lots of info too: 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:14:12
Sorry for asking all those probably stupid sounding questions, but why is it called a "fork" then and not just an "update"? Isn't a fork another slightly changed version?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:35:07
There are many different implementations the biggest one is written in C I think and eclair uses Scala
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:32:22
Yeah, but in the US you can buy everything with US$ and the merchant keeps the US$, when you buy something with bitcoins online or somewhere else the merchant usually recieves US$ or another currency like Yuan or he immediately trades the Bitcoin for the other currency. Currently bitcoins behave much more like a trading asset (stocks etc.) than a currency like US$.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:24:43
Ok, I think now I understand, thanks very much!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:56
Yeah, thanks! I am just trying to make a wallet that includes all the other steps like being able to buy bitcoins inside the wallet or at least provide instructions on how to do so that everyone can understand. If you have anything you miss from your current wallet it would be awesome if you would share that btw :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:09:14
But if someone's losing his bitcoins then or even worse everyone is getting hact no one would ever trust it. Better wait for half a year and then launch with confidence than risk everything and people's money
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:24:52
Wow, thank you very much. That's some interesting stuff and I hope we can learn from the mistakes the developers made and not underestimate security. As you said, it's people's money we would be dealing with!

Kinda sad that this got downvoted all the way. Seems like this community is not able to have a civilized discussion, but only memes..

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:33:12
But when it's not a currency, what is bitcoin? The huge gains are only based on the fact that people believe in Bitcoin being a currency one day..
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:54:41
That's true, at an early stage the lightning network is vulnerable to many spam attacks. But when more and more people start using it and the number of full nodes increases there shouldn't be any scaling issues. The problem with bitcoin is that more miners also increase the difficulty so the number of transactions per second doesn't increase. The lightning network doesn't have any difficulty because there are no rewards. I hope this cleared up some things!
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:26:25
I that would be the case it would be a HUGE security issue with all lightning apps, I mean every tech can fail. But I'm 99% sure that when the phone died during the closing of a channel the funds just return or are never send into the channel, correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:27:18
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to achieve, I'm sick of just waiting for others to make a Bitcoin wallet that just fits my needs
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:32:21
You can have channels opened as long as you want I think. But to transfer money from a channel to a non-lightning address you need to close the channel. But as time goes on there will be more and more lightning addresses so at some time in the future Bitcoins in an old Wallet and Bitcoins in a channel will be like Money in a bank account and cash I think.

You are part of why Bitcoin gets closer and closer to its goal: being handled like money, not like a stock. Thank You!

But looks really great btw
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:04:54
I know, but not everyone here is a programmer and this is more readable for someone who never touched code I think, but you are right
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:18:02
Hehe :D Sounds good!
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:33
Yeah, I know no one will ever make something that 100% of people can use. But currently it seems like maybe 20% of people are willing to invest their time in setting up a wallet and dealing with potential issues. I just hope to get the confusion out of Bitcoin so it can finally become a currency. Will take a lot of time and hard work though, but I think the open source community can do it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:53:49
I think it gets calculated with current exchange rates. Which exchange they are using I don't know. But if the rate is 100LTC for 1BTC you could swap 50LTC's for 0.5BTC's for example I think
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:23:42
As far as I know, the Lightning Network focuses on being a solution when you want to buy something, not when you want to send some bitcoins to your friend. A lightning address gets generated and contains even a small note. It looks like this: lightning:lntb1u1pdzug4xpp5dfvj7eprtumwsr38k5dwmc2fe6hk6fuv2vn6j2h2qkangtvgv9csdq8fehhgegcqzysd225e6jequt583wsjfarzqg55qm6qp8wpns7fwcxduedy3pzuug84dyuyzc5czcx2cj6zppev6j5zzf89vgd8jm9rqe9tv3nww2xv3gqlulqrj
So normal bitcoin wallets want even recognise a lightning address 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:56:10
Yeah, the concept of the lightning network could be used for almost every cryptocurrency. But I think the devs are already working with litecoin. I've heard that it will be even possible to swap bitcoins with litecoins, called "Atomic Swap"
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:05:30
Its way too easy to submit something. Is gonna be full of fake stuff
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:31:04
I got mine from this awesome site:  , but you can just google "Bitcoin testnet faucet" or mine some yourself on the testnet mining is only possible with a CPU so even a normal laptop should be able to hash a block in a reasonable timeframe without a pool!
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:51:01
hey, I just started writing a wiki on the GitHub page of the project, would be very kind of you if you'd take a look at it [here]( since it seems like you know a lot about this topic!
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:07:33
Yes, the whole thing with channels even confused me at the beginning. To understand it I had to watch a 10 minute video of someone explaining it. This will never work that way
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:32:45
To be honest, it is kinda true that almost every tutorial on frameworks is about features and not about how to secure them. I will definitely keep that in mind and make some research on security of such applications. I also hope to later find some people who are experienced in finding vulnerabilities in apps to ensure that the user's funds are at no risk at any time. Thanks very much for sharing your knowledge and providing the information!

I recently bought 100CAD$ worth of Bitcoin at an ATM in Vancouver, I wanted to try out and see how it works. I got the bitcoins in my wallet 3 hours later and the transaction fees were high too (Recieved ~0.006btc, about 88$ at that time).

Thanks! I did not even think about the unit's yet, but using SAT sounds kinda good. Maybe I can introduce some kind of symbol for it too since $1 looks way cooler than 1USD in my opinion. And if you have any other ideas, feel free to submit them here: 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:22:55
In theory you could already use it on mainnet. All the code is online and because it is decentralized it doesn't need any servers to change. The only problem is that you would be the only one being able to use it on mainnet so you couldn't even spin up a channel. But first transactions have already occurred on mainnet so now every known bug has to be fixed so there are enough recourses to focus on bug when going public on main
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:18:41
I'm not an expert regarding the technology behind bitcoin, etc. Would it be technically possible to split 1 BTC in, let's say, 10000 Bitcoins? Becuase once a decentralized system like bitcoin is established and working it is pretty hard to change the rules of it, isn't it?

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:08:00
Okay, so BCash, for example, is a hard fork and requires a new system and is another cryptocurrency.
But I'm not sure if I know what exactly a soft fork is. Is it a change to the Bitcoin code that co-exists next to Bitcoin, but shares the same transactions so you can transfer coins between soft forks?

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:38:19
Ough, that sounds like something groundbreaking and like a Problem all lightning wallets would have to face. I hope there will be a solution to that soon! Thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:17:32
Yeah. I bought at 4k and thought "fuck, missed the rise in early 2017, would be lucky if it goes up to 5k this year". Now we're at almost 12k!
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:23:11
That would be nice on the one hand (we all have more money), but a bit inconvenient too. Because Bitcoin's purpose is to replace current money afterall and having 1$ as the minimum possible is way too high in my opinion. Everything over 10$ per μBTC would be too high.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:00:32
Yeah, I'm glad you understand how a discussion works and also understand my viewpoint, so do I understand yours. This is why I love (most of) Reddit!
No one knows where Bitcoin will go and what it will be in the future, but what we know is that it is hell of a time to be alive and to be part of this revolution, no matter if it will fail or not, Students will be taught about bitcoin in 50 years and how it succeeded or failed!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:26:27
That's exactly what I'm trying to achieve. A wallet which can just be used without having to have any knowledge whatsoever :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:04:40
Yea, but currently we have to focus all development power on making the network production ready on the mainnet so it can be used for real. But it would definitely be interesting to make one to see how easy it is to implement the lightning network for merchants!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:05:15
Yeah, to fund your channel you still need to rely on blockchain transactions
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:42:18

@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:01
I know, this is going to be a lot of work and I don't expect this to be even in beta status anytime soon. But if I manage to get some people to help and they also put their brainpower into this I think we can get a working prototype which then can be tested and improved by other people
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:54:34
Yeah, in my opinion, this hate going on is nonsense. I regularly trade BTC to BCH and BCH to BTC. Let the better coin win!
I just think that they should have posted this update on both subreddits to keep the community from fighting each other...
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:09:54
I think I am really the opposite of a troll. I have about 40% of my crypto in BTC and 40% in BCH. I am just saying that I don't take people serious who state things without having a reliable source. I agree that the timing by Coinbase was wrong, but if Bitcoin is better than Bitcoin Cash, that shouldn't be a problem, eh?
And also the fact that people (if it's true what you are saying) are able to higher the transaction fees by spamming then this is a weakness of Bitcoin. IOTA, for example, should be faster when the network gets spammed. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:22:00
Which every dev would be like you and trying to adopt to new systems fast! You are why the open source community is so great, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:54:01

Ok, that's interesting, my inner eye tells me that you are going to take a shit tomorrow at around 3pm
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:39:14
You may wonder why some earlier transactions are "Pending": I tried to pay for a lightning coffee earlier today and the transactions didn't make it. This tells that we still need a lot of improvement and right now I am about to make my first PR to the lightning project!
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:33:28
Yeah, but this is because Shares of Stocks usually can't be devided so you either buy 1 Amazon stock or none. With Bitcoin, you can own fractions.
But I think a split of bitcoin would be necessary at some point
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:07:41
I never said that exchanging "real" money to bitcoins is wrong, I only hope that someday the price of bitcoins is stable enough so it will be handled like money and not like a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:23
Coinbase is focused on doing business, not on saving a crypto coin. Just stay open-minded. If Bitcoin is better than Bitcoin Cash it will win. If it's not, it won't. It's as easy as that!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:04:26
And BTW your meme doesn't really make sense here since it is not a standard we are trying to implement, but a new app that would solve the problem I mentioned. As far as I know Bitcoin Wallet's are not a standard, SegWit for example is trying to be one 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:34:11
!remindme 22 days
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:22:56
In theory: yes, but you can also see it like just adding a few more decimal possibilities at there of each Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:30:34
But making one bitcoin to 10 is the same thing as adding one decimal place. Only the psychology is different
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:39:55
Yeah, I think that certifications are completely redundant since they don't show how you can apply your skills to real problems. I think I'll set up some kind of slack workspace or discord or whatever so we can work stronger together. In the meantime feel free to add any ideas/thoughts you have on GitHub via the Issue page. This would help a lot to form first prototypes!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:27:29
Exactly, I really think that the thing holding most people back from Bitcoin (at least it is holding my dad back) is its complexity. If we can make Bitcoin as easy as swiping a credit card, I'm sure it will become mainstream!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:58:41
1. Yes, but this will probably be a choice and can be disabled by the user. Problem is also that 2FA is usually done on a phone and the Wallet will be a mobile app too, so security benefits have to be evaluated.
2. Yes, will be considered, but we should first try to find a way without storing such data on a server since this would be a possible vulnerability. If we do so, we should definitely make sure that it is encrypted AF.
3. Yes, QR codes will be used a lot since they are so easy to use!
4. Hardware Wallet Support of Ledger &amp; Co. will be considered and is likely to be implemented. If not from the beginning, definitely in a future release.
5. Yes, you say it. Making SegWit a choice would be dump because many don't know what it is and what benefits they get. We have to handle it like everything else would be stoneage.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:52:28
To be honest: no, not alone. That's why I posted this because I know we got some brilliant people around here who can help me to make it work together!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:34:50
The difference is that with doing it with credit card you spent dollars/euros and use a centralized system. The lightning network uses bitcoins and it is decentralized. It is a way to prove that a transaction will happen so you can make sure you will revieve the bitcoins even though the transaction isn't filed in the blockchain yet
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:02:25
Yes, there are a lot of mobile Wallet's out there, but how many support SegWit and the Lightning Network? Currently, I think Eclair is the only open source mobile Wallet supporting it and it only works on Android. But I can totally understand your point. I just think that competition keeps the market healthy and I am not afraid of putting extra work in it :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:30
Yes and no. There are many running nodes on bitcoins testnet right now so you can use it. Testnet bitcoins are worthless so it is only for testing. But you could spin up a couple of nodes on mainnet and start using it, the only problem is that no one accepts lightning payments yet and the whole network would be very unstable.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:03:04
Yeah, indeed I didn't expect to get so many nice responses by so many nice people! Once I know what knowledge is needed I'll contact you, I am really impressed by this community at the moment!
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:36:10
Yes, maybe my post was a bit misleading, but what I mean is that currently bitcoins behave like a trading asset (stocks etc.) and not like a "real" currency. When you buy something with Bitcoins they usually get traded to "real" currencies and the merchant doesn't keep them. I just hope that at some point in the future it is not necessary anymore to exchange bitcoins with "real" currencies because the merchant keeps his bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:15:21
Yeah, you spotted that I'm not a backend developer. Right now I want to make the lightning app more user-friendly and fix some bugs that I can tackle with my JavaScript knowledge. But please explain what exactly I got wrong, I have to admit that I still don't quite get how it works in detail even though some of my comments may have sounded like I got it :)

I'm pretty sure I can budget myself, I used to buy many stupid things but I have been saving for a few month now and at my personla ATH right now ;) But thanks!
And this whole thing is also more like an experiment for myself to see how bitcoins will work out and to introduce my dad to the world of crypto. He's a bit too sceptical of it all and I thought this would be a nice way because it's money he would have given me any way and maybe he decides to buy some BTC for himself too
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:39
A friendly reminder by someone who's holding bitcoin and believing that BCash is very obsolete: the downvote button is only used for comments that don't contribute in discussion and not to hate on other stuff like BCash.

@_date: 2017-12-11 23:57:03
yes, but there are not enough nodes and no application supports it yet. But you could just git clone for example eclair and change a couple of variables I think
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:02:21
Always remember that most of our current politicians didn't grow up with the internet. The politicians in 20-50 years will all know much more about it and also think differently about this topic :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:01:26
I have it too, but none of my friends are really interested in bitcoin except for "Oh cool! I may be rich in 1 year". But as far as I understand you can only send lightning transactions with eclair so far. But try out  it's made by the team behind eclair. When I tried it it didn't work and the transaction is still "Pending", but maybe you have more luck!

@_date: 2017-12-13 14:50:54
Exactly these are the problems all of us developers are facing. But if we as a community can all put some of our brainpower in thinking about these problems I believe every single one can be solved
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:18:44
That's a problem almost every new system is facing. But I suggest you to not just wait until it is established, but to try contributing yourself. This can be done in many different ways: If you can code, consider supporting Eclair Wallet, Zap Wallet or other lightning projects by fixing known bugs on GitHub. Or you could just try to spread the word, use it and report bugs you encounter. Don't just wait for the system to change, change it yourself!

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:46:21
No? I view bitcoin as a thing that has a purpose assigned to it by its creators: To replace our current currencies and to be used to pay for things without it being exchanged to fiat. But a currency only works if it doesn't change its value much. Just imagine an advert in your post today that's printed 7 days ago saying "Buy an iPhone for 1700$" but by now an iPhone is worth 1000$ because the dollar went up by 70% as bitcoin did.

Well, the fact that you are using Reddit that shows you are way smarter than my grandma' ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:29:04
Thanks! Currently I am just brainstorming some ideas together over [here]( If you have any ideas or something you would like to see in the wallet let me know so I will add it!

Am I complaining about the other subs? No, I am complaining about this one and saying we should ignore the hate
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:05:57
Not saying that what you're doing is wrong, but you handle bitcoin like a stock or other trading asset. Not like a currency what it is supposed to be and to succeed bitcoins should also be handled like a currency!

I hope to overcome this issue by just running checks in the background. Phones are usually never turned completely off, and even if that's not possible (Android likes to close apps with no reason) or on PC, I think it would be possible to run the algorithms whenever the app is started. I also want to have many smaller channels instead of one big one so that when one or two are closed, there is still enough available balance in the spendings/cash account. But these are the kinds of problems we will be facing and we will have to tackle them
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:43:17
Are you sure about this, because I haven't heard of such a thing and where should the funds go? I mean bitcoins can never just disappear. Do you have some article or blog where it gets mentioned so I can read into this, I mean if this is the case, that would be a big problem
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:29:00
The coffeeshop is for demo purposes only and the bitcoins I spent are worth 0$. But once lightning goes mainnet real applications like a supermarket or movie rental would be awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:14:37
Its just a codename right now, I needed to name the repo something ;) but if you have an idea for a name, feel free to suggest it!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:02:10
That's irrelevant for the lightning network because it's a so-called "Second Layer" which doesn't depend on the blockchain. It should be able to handle billions of transactions a second, compared to 5 transactions a second on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:29:44
First of all: I like your spirit! There are many different ways to help, it would be really helpful for example just to spread the word and inform friends and companies about the current situation of bitcoin and that the lightning network will solve some problems. Another way to help would be just by using the network and informing the devs about bugs and features you want to see! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:17:35
I basically tought myself too, it's never too late to get into coding as well as into Bitcoin. So both together is perfect :D
I would suggest you to first build something like a chatapp and watch some talks. It's always inspiring to watch other people talk about their experiences!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:09
But I really appreciate that you ask these questions, the more questions we get, the better the product will be because to answer these questions I have to recall think about the problem, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:40
Yep, crypto is crazy
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:32:10
I'm relatively new to the lightning network myself but it sure just helps if you try it out yourself and try to find bugs to report :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:52:42
Oh, I didn't know the developer community is already that big, awesome! I'll def. check out the links and see what is needed most currently. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:24:35
Really? According to  it went up by ~3000% since January 2015, which is 3 years. So: 3000/(256*3) = 3.9, I rounded it down a bit because of the high gains in November.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:20:51
No, not really. I posted this to encourage a discussion on this move by the pineapple fund. In my opinion they could have handled it better by, for example, posting the update on their website and then posting a link on both subreddits.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:27:09
If the channel gets closed by one party all transactions ever occurred on this channel get bundled into one huge one that's then broadcasted to the blockchain. That's where the fees are saved
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:02:51
As far as I know the lightning network gains its advantages by bundling thousands of lightning transactions into one transaction on the blockchain and then splitting up the fees. But its technology allows to confirm transaction before they appear in the block or even get broadcasted. I am not sure when exactly a lightning transaction gets bundled
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:29:35
Thanks! I'm German myself and before we even think about translation we need a concept and then eventually a working prototype. But if you want to contribute in any other way, you're very welcome to do so!
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:57:08
Hey, if you guys come up with something, no matter how it looks like for now, feel free to throw your concepts into an [issue]( on GitHub so those concepts can be discussed over there (much more convenient than reddit) :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:37
I thought to implement two different modes: "Expert" and "Standard", on expert mode you have full control over channels and can close/open them whenever you want. On standard mode However things would get a bit more complicated on our side: I hope to implement some kind of algorithm that automatically opens and closes channels so that there are always as many funds in the spending/cash wallet as the user wants to have. If a channel gets closed without the user wanting to close it, another channel with the same funding is automatically opened again. That way the user doesn't have to know how it works, all he knows is that there are two wallets: one for savings and one for fast transactions
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:51:53
That would make no sense because for this to work the $price of both would have to be exactly the same all the time, but I'm not 100% sure
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:20:54
And this is the kind of answer I was hoping for! Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:21:12
But even then the bitcoins you spent get converted to a "real" currency. I hope that in the future when you buy stuff with bitcoins, the merchant also gets bitcoins and keeps them to pay, for example, his rent with the same bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:46:00
I will, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:35:58
You could, theoretically, use it right now on Mainnet. But there currently there are not enough nodes in the main net to do that. That's because the dev's still want to improve the network and remove some bugs until they launch software to run a node yourself on mainnet
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:30:04
Yeah, Electron seems to be promising for desktop and for mobile I've even thought making a PWA. But that wouldn't have iOS support yet
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:57
Just google 'lightning network slack' and first link should take to a page where you can sign in :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:00
You have to wait a few hours until GDAX has enough liquidity 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:36:09
No, for me it makes a huge difference because when we are finally able to buy stuff with bitcoins without having them ever converted to "real" money it means that bitcoin has become "real" money and not just a trading asset and money to buy illegal stuff
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:04:59
Give shapeshift a try
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:53:11
I don't think that there would be risk of losing money when closing an ln channel in the background, unless some malicious app would hijack the process maybe...
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:22:14
BTW this post was meant to be sarcastic and to trigger a few people hanging around here on I personally have no idea where the price will go. But I'll keep my promise regarding

Not quite yet but there are WordPress plugins coming and the documentation is pretty good too, so feel free to try it out on testnet! And thanks for doing this btw, the more people support it the better it will get!
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:19:29
Youre right, but what I tried to say is that many see bitcoin as a thing you buy with "real" money and then sell it to get "real" money back. I see bitcoin as money, without the third party currencies in between.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:28:37
Yeah, that's what we planned, if this works out the bitcoins will be adjusted in 12 month again
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:58:19
Haha, I can relate somehow :D
A friend of my family (works for a big IT company) introduced me to python when I was 11 years old, I made small games and somehow never lost my interests in coding and solving problems :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:09:59






BitPay is a start. But when bitcoin succeeds BitPay will become obsolete because the merchant doesn't want $/€/etc., he wants bitcoins because he can use bitcoins as we use $/€/etc. today
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:35:17
I didn't make this demo, I'm not quite sure how much effort it would take for someone to accept lightning payments, but thanks to the active community I'm sure therell be lots of plugins and libraries coming out!
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:16:18
I used some random open source wallet when I bought my first BTC over 3 years ago when I was 15. Getting the coins was a bit harder tho because major exchanges require ID verification. I just went to a local BTC ATM, put my Wallets Address in there with some cash and received the coins in a matter of minutes. Really happy with how great it worked out :)
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:23:52
Excuse me, but how can you believe that paying taxes is theft? Without taxes your country would have no money, hence not exist. There wouldn't be schools, police, courts, streets. There would be nothing. I agree however that the way poor people are taxed relatively more in comparison to rich people is BS. Not taxing bitcoin only helps rich people avoid taxes which indeed is stealing from the average Joe. That might actually be why bitcoin will have a future: an easy way for rich people to avoid taxes.
@_date: 2019-12-01 11:58:26
Thanks very much for the well-written answer! I have to admit that I do not in fact know much about this topic and it seems you do. Also I don't know much about the situation in the US since I have lived in Germany for the majority of my life and here I haven't seen many people complain about taxes. Actually the government wanted to put tolls on our Autobahn or parts of it at least and it backfired tremendously.
I can see how private schools do offer better education than public ones but at least from my experience I can say that public schools here are quite good and offer a good graduation degree. Also university is free of charge because of taxes so even kids with a poor background do get the chance to one day earn enough money to support their own family.
This did get a bit off topic but I hope we both can agree that some form of a general tax can be good for a country if (and thats a big IF) the stupid people in charge care for people.
