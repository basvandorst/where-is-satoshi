The return of This actually generated a bit of press last time, it's probably a good thing. Plus, those people probably didn't have wallets before, so it will definitely get new people interested.

It's super scary, though. I don't normally gamble, which is exactly what I feel this is like. It's also kind of exhilarating.
I feel like the potential gain on a few hundred bucks is maybe worth it, though.

I don't think it will be widely used until the system becomes more robust against attacks. DDOSing one exchange has made the price there drop by a significant margin this morning ... and you can probably bet that whoever did it is probably going to do it again, before the next time they buy.

@_date: 2013-04-12 07:13:34
Give it time - and by that I mean, more than a couple days.
A problem with BTC that's becoming more apparent to me is that people have _really fucking short_ attention spans these days. The reason it probably became so unstable is because a lot of people bought in and _instantly_ wanted to become rich.
New technology takes time, man. Just chill out and enjoy the ride. And don't listen to the Eagles, I really hate them.

But Avogadro never said anything about whether or not matter is infinitely divisible. He just made up a number and established that as the number of 'things' in a mole. There's no statement about divisibility.
Anyway, I don't think it was actually Lavoisier but rather Dalton who effectively came up with modern atomic theory - the idea that an element is made of atoms of a single, distinct type. He presented this work around 1803, and Avogadro didn't come around on the scientific scene for another ~15 years.

They just want to learn. Asking questions is a good way to do that.

@_date: 2013-04-11 02:05:26
Yeah ... other exchanges have higher levies on each transation as well, which helps to discourage this kind of micro-trading. It also means you make less money with each trade, though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:39:52
You're quite optimistic. Do you really think that's an attainable goal?

That's suuuuper not going to happen.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:42:52
If you're looking to get out, then get out. Don't let Reddit bully you one way or another.
I think a lot of exchanges are a little busted right now, though things already seem to be on the mend. I think the value is already back up around 200, so you could probably make a nice chunk of change.
You might have trouble cashing out all at once without verifying your identity with the exchange, though. I think a lot of them have 1k$/day limits.
You're smart to get out while you're ahead. I'd get the fuck out now too, if I could buy a house with the earnings. I'm going to stay in a little while longer. The idea of paying off student loans with bitcoin profit is too appealing a goal not to pursue.

That's one way around amazon not accepting BTC directly. Nicely done.
Imagine if you could have just used their normal checkout, though? When that day comes, I think we'll see a lot fewer 'bubble' threads in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:15:43
I'd be interested to know how this works as well. Previously I've only gone through cavirtex.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:37:06
I'm pretty sure that doesn't matter. Thanks though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:21:51
Why does it happen regularly, roughly weekly?
Why not either all the time, or sporadically?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:09:50
A lot of those sites only pay out once a day or week.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:53:06
Right now, bitcoin actually. I bought in with an amount of money that it wouldn't hurt too much to see vanish ... mostly as an experiment, but also to get a little stake now in case it does take off.
If it ever does become mainstream, I anticipate that the value of each BTC will at least be higher than where it was when I started. It very well may not - I suspect a competitor or legislation to be the biggest risks right now - but if it does hang around, I think we'll all be looking good.
People see the price right now and think, "That's way too expensive, I'd never pay a hundred bucks for one of those things!" ... but they don't seem to realize it's divisible to parts of 0.00000001. It's not quite so intimidating when you think about it at that scale, as an average person.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:34:14
What are they doing?

It's probably not much use for mining, but you could always help LHC physicists out: 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:22:43
In the meantime, this kind of approach is pretty good. You get to use BTC for what you want (indirectly, and not harnessing all of the BTC benefits), and the company making it possible gets to reap the benefit while amazon sees no change.
Gyft probably hopes amazon never starts accepting BTC directly, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:22:57
MtGox can't get their shit together, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:54:49
Yeah, I knew that. I guess, assuming that you actually _get_ one, can you mine enough to pay for it within a reasonable amount of time?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:02:29
How does PayPal know what you're buying?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:02:35
If it dips/levels off/crashes, it might pick right back up again ... or it might pick up in a month, or a year. Or never.
Don't invest any more than you're willing to lose, and my other bit of advice for you would be to ignore the price for a few months after you do buy some. Just let it sit there - BTC might go up long-term, or crash to nothing. If they go up, though, they'll probably go way up.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:01:40
The odds are hardly impossible to compute. I'd say the chance of things taking off again is holding steady at [0.3333 - repeating of course.](
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:38:56
Probably depends on the exchange? This is a good site for mtgox:
... but I am mostly dealing elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:14:10
They haven't been around since the first bubble, have they?
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:42:36
Are these things actually worth the money? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:52:04
Sure, in that case MtGox is the biggest one. I use a Canadian exchange, so I'm not particularly clear on how its details work. If you're Canadian, it's CAVirtex, and you can cash out in CAD.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:01:34
I was joking, don't worry. At this rate, people are going to think _I_ work for them. It's a good thing for us to support the early adopter businesses, because if we don't then no one will, and that is a really good way for BTC to fail. If no one actually _uses_ the things, then there's not much point to them in the first place.
Also, I don't work for them.
Plot twist: I do.
... but actually, I don't.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:59:26
That is one of the most frustrating things at the moment. I actually had to go to a _bank_. Like, with _real people_.
Luckily they didn't ask me what the cash deposit was for. I'd probably of said "magical internet math money," and tried to get out without making eye contact.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:16:45
No, they can only be split down to 0.00000001 BTC.
