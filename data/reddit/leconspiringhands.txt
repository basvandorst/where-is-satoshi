So instead of trying to promote a system encouraging rational thought or challenging political correctness, let's just keep taking the soma pill of politician-speak.

Heads up to everybody. The plan in the OP post by Sunlot is **different than*** the plan their representative put forward in the [recorded Google Hangout]( earlier this same week.
Namely, they first said they would not use customer funds to pay for an audit and investigation, now the current plan says they plan to use $10MIL of customer funds to do it.

D-don't worry g-guys, my 23 bitcoin is s-still safe in Mt. Gox, right?

This doesn't lock out OKCoin, does it?

As if deciding to liquidate everything now would be any less authoritarian of a decision to impose on creditors.
The gist from the dialogue is that OKCoin would still distribute a certain amount of the remaining assets to creditors and then issue shares of the revitalized company in proportion to the remaining debt.

Probably that the community [tracking of likely Mt. Gox transactions]( is moving forward. Fellow victims take heart.

Now, I'm *not* saying that if a pic of a dead Karpeles surfaced with a bitcoin QR code I'd donate profusely, but if something like that *did* happen, somebody who isn't me might hack my wallet for the sole purpose of donating to said QR code.

You liquidate gox and we still only get a mere pittance for our lost money.
Shill somewhere else.

The level of butthurt emanating from every single on of your posts truly is the definition of satisfaction.
