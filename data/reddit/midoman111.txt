We only have 1 Bitcoin ATM here and it is about 50 kilometers from me.(not South African,just live here)

Aha,that is why everything pro-Palestine or anti-Israel on is downvoted to death.

Egyptian Bitcoiner here,joined.

I meant a way to obtain free coins.I know that mining is a costly process nowadays.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:58:35
Shhhhh,it's a new "sneaky" method of begging for a bigger tip on this sub and @_date: 2014-10-25 08:05:10
I do...
@_date: 2014-09-28 16:51:56
Just wait for the next big stock market crash (like the one in 2008).
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:20:05
Nice to pay it forward!
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:05:40
Would you mind giving me a link to your Steam community profile?It's totally fine if you don't want to,but I just want to see what a $2300 would have on it.

bank account
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:18:46
Because Apple are paying companies to add Applepay.
@_date: 2014-09-28 07:04:08
No,but there isn't a big userbase of cryptocurrencies.Even the ones who use Bit/Doge are scattered around the country,in at least 6 different cities (that I know of,probably more).
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:03:39
The community is becoming as friendly as @_date: 2014-09-27 20:58:50
I'm in South Africa right now and for the next few years.Don't think I'll ever get to see one of those here :(
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:08:22
I love the "I'm new to Bitcoin,please shower me with your tips" posts.
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:49:46
Sorry if I am stupid but what does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-19 15:35:51
You can't on Coinbase. If they were to suddenly disappear, so would your BTC. Don't worry about it though, they are here to stay at least for the near future.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:17:55
Still *my* own money that I shouldn't be paying to withdraw.
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:05:46
Mind if I have some,OP?
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:36:48
Thanks a lot mate.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:48:05
That's like saying "people would pay 25,000 satoshi for a loaf of bread."
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:51:22
Not a vaper but I think you should try posting over at too,would sure be beneficial to lure some vapers into the Bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:17:19
Dogecoin isn't though, as far I know. It is the biggest alt coin (or second biggest) out there.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:59:28
Link please?I'm genuinely interested.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:17:29
That is stupid on so many levels.
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:37:36
What a time to be alive.
@_date: 2014-10-25 19:22:21
Sneaky OP,using a referral.
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:02:04
That's the one.I'm living in Pretoria though so I can't go there *only* to buy Bitcoins+I can't drive yet.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:16:57
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:00:30
What happened to the last cent?
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:55:14
I'm going to tip you and check my changetip account to see how much it took from me
1 shitty tip Edit:The bot didn't respond,so I guess that means that it is a fake tipping amount.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:07:04
@_date: 2014-09-27 12:30:41
Why someone would keep more than 1 Bitcoin on an online wallet is the real shocker here.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:07:44
1% of 10 dollars is not 1 cent,it is 10 cents.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:06:55
You have been spending way too much time on @_date: 2014-09-13 09:59:15
Should I invest a lot of money in Bitcoins or is it not worth the risk?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:28:55
5000 signatures are nothing to a company which has millions of customers.This will do nothing but show Amazon that only 5,000 people are interested in this.
@_date: 2014-09-14 08:58:01
No thanks,I don't want to take other people's money.I just want a legit way to make bitcoins online
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:37:01
No it isn't.Just check my post history if you are *that* curious.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:14:55
I especially agree with  "bubble" is going to happen to another crypto soon.I don't want to say which one is it but it is pretty obvious.
@_date: 2014-10-26 15:39:54
Sure,any altcoin will do.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:41:29
Which is why you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.People tend to forget that Bitcoin is relatively new (5 years?) and that we don't know most of it's ins and outs yet.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:27:19
1 satoshi
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:36:59
Congrats!I'm currently saving up for a $20 Steam wallet code from faucets,so far I have about $6.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:55:24
I didn't donate it to the bank.
@_date: 2014-09-14 08:45:44
Got any of them?At this point,I don't care about what I'm getting in return.
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:43:45
Did I say it is impossible?I just said that it is unlikely that a company as big as Coinbase would disappear in the near future.
@_date: 2014-10-25 18:52:29
So are credit cards/debit cards '"fake" money also?
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:31:13
Just wait.
RemindMe! 6 months
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:59:00
Did they tip it via the tipbot or did they send it to their address though?
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:28:35
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:07:31
OP is probably going to link to the comment as a post and write "told you so!" as the title.
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:11:10
It is actually true though.Bitcoin grew 3000% in price in the span of 3 years.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:27:24
I'm confused,so if you (for example) get paid 1 Bitcoin per hour and 1 BTC is worth $1000,if it reaches $500 the next hour will you get paid 2 Bitcoins or still 1 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-11 15:18:35
10 cents????Are they *that* cheap?
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:59:11
How will you make a profit?I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:54:12
Just bought Civ V today with a combination of Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Check my post history!
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:47:14
If he can afford it, then why not? He is probably an adult and knows what he is getting himself into.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:39:32
Love the idea.
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:02:06
I'd rather give my money to kids in Africa or an actual charity. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:47:42
Good luck!
RemindMe! 2 months
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:13:26
That would only make them more financially unstable.
@_date: 2014-09-13 09:59:51
What is the best online wallet site for bitcoins?(Not in the U.S. or Europe by the way)
@_date: 2015-04-30 20:44:40
Just say it. We won't judge you.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:48:27
That is fucking disgusting.
