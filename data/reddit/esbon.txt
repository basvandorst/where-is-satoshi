Which would mean that for market transactions in the next couple of months buyers and sellers are playing a game of hot potato/russian roulette. If you want bitcoin to be a mainstream instead of a bit-player in the currency market people are going to need more confidence in it's stability.

"The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again."
