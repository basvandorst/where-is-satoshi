Segwit as a scaling solution /s

I'm guessing if segwit then LN activates on Litecoin's network first and the results are poor, this will save Bitcoin going down the same route. As a litecoin holder would prefer it activates on bitcoins network first.

I believe the plan B is that litecoin gets segwit &amp; LN and becomes the payment layer, Bitcoin aims to be the high value settlement layer ths will reduce the transaction load on bitcoins network removing the need fr it to scale via segwit or bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:00:27
This would only lead to more transàctions on the network, which is now seen as a bad thing.

Quote from a litecoin dev below  - 
I legitimately get more and more stressed every time I say this to someone. SegWit is not a block size scaling solution. SegWit would allow the implementation of Lightning Networks and Confidential Transactions. With LN we would be able to work on things like atomic swap txs, when you could seamlessly transact Litecoin on the Bitcoin network. And that's just the start.

Healthy fee market /s

Can someone inform this litecoin dev that segwit is a scaling solution he must have ran out of kool aid,  quote below  -

Litecoin will either make or break segwit/LN, if segwit activation on Litecoin's network causes a flat or depreciating LTC price don't expect segwit coming to Bitcoin anytime soon.

Someone should tell miners there's no problem, as the block reward diminishes fees will take up the slack there is no need to worry about the lightening network eating into their fee revenue in the future /s
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:38:25
I'm a litecoin holder however I honestly think segwit/LN will be a epic flop on Litecoin's network, which in turn will be huge blow for Bitcoin core's plans.

I think anything under 95% would be considerer a controversial soft-fork. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:00:08
  
Don't you thing Lightning Network is big opportunity for LTC and other alt coins?
charles lee : It definitely is. You can make cross chain payments between Bitcoin and Litecoin lightening networks.   
This is why I'm a huge advocate for Lightening and why I am pushing to get SegWit activated on Litecoin and Bitcoin. Lightening needs SegWit to be effective. Well, to be exact, it needs a maleability fix and I believe it's best accomplished with a softfork SegWit.

Also don't forget to operate an atomic clock to verify GMT.

Just let's get segwit - LN - blockstream hub so they can pay their investors back already. All this dressing up of bob as your average joe channel operator is hillarious. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 14:43:08
Maybe there's some way a block can be expanded to hold a greater number of transactions, to remove the backlog? I guess if there were a way it would have been done already.

I've actually been using bitcoin since 2011 never mined or ran a node and no plan to do so ever. Insisting everyone runs a node in order to be a user is incorrect, it only resticts adoption and usage. If you feel the need to do so fair play  the majority do not. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:59:07
I think this is more about brian armstrongs implimentation preferences, the reality is if he were pro-core he would be peppered with air kisses and confetti. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 11:46:31
Fight, attack - seriously dude this sounds like talk of desperation if you're a miner just vote with your hash power, a user just vote with your feet. If something doesn't go your way do you always put it down to a breakdown in immutability and consensus ? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:30:55
If only there was a way actual individual users could choose features by opting in or out, then programmers simply serve code which is adopted or not. No leader group, clicks or self appointed kings, just code and users. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 13:30:53
Everyone might as well wait and see the result of segwit/LN activation on Litecoin's network first. If it goes down like a lead balloon then Bitcoin dodged a bullet. At least it will differentiate litecoin further from Bitcoin the settlement layer if it works out.

I'm a bitcoiner from 2011 who is completely certain CSW is satoshi, this will be clearly understood as fact by the end of 2020. 
You are the one in the dark unable to comprehend events correctly. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:07:34
CSW is going to prove in a court of law not by signing. Expectation of a signing ceremony laid on for btc hodlers and altcoin lambo'ys fails to understand he intends to prove to mainstream while leaving the "crypto" twitter, Reddit community behind not take them along with him.

This document was initially supplied by ira, it makes zero sense that csw would have any access to Dave's private email. Both parties have access to use these docs as exhibits...........
"The two disputing parties are parsing through thousands of documents that belonged to David Kleiman, his brother Ira, and the business W&amp;K Info Defense Research. This includes documents that stem from a number of electronic devices, computers, phones, hard drives, encrypted chats, and emails that belonged to Kleiman."

97% of the crypto space is a joke, I'm happy to count myself as the 3%.
@_date: 2019-04-17 10:29:44
Might be worthwhile finding out if it was Craig or ira klienman who filled this doc.

Isn't having a VC backed company spearhead Bitcoin development a government attack vector then? Cannot government simply ban the use of Bitcoin entirely within their country if they so choose. Calling Bitcoin fragile and having to move transactions off-chain feels like cop out to me, this might prove to be wrong and layer 2 might save Bitcoin or lightning hubs will be run by large corporations that too can be manipulated at will by governments. Whatever the result never a dull moment in bitcoinland.

Bch is going to scale as satoshi's white paper outlined not via sewit-LN, so bch is the Bitcoin outlined in the whitepaper. As Charles Lee puts it -" Bitcoin (btc) has moved past the original whitepaper". Personally though I want to stick with the bitcoin I first used in 2011 - so for me Bitcoin cash is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:20:15
Bitcoin forked, one thing became two - all who sold their bch are aware of this and made profit   .I didn't hold btc at the time of the fork as development for me had already diverted from the Bitcoin I used from 2011. I bought Bitcoin cash post fork for me bch cash is a return to satoshi's roadmap as outlined in satoshi's whitepaper. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:25:02
I didn't hold any btc then bought bch after the fork I don't particularly mind whether it remains at 10% of btc or goes down (btc up) for me bch resembles the bitcoin I first used in 2011. Btc feels unfamiliar which doesn't mean LN - segwit won't be a huge success it just isn't the right fit for me.

Credit card fees are added to most things in advance so if you buy something with say cash or Bitcoin you're paying the credit card fees.

Do some research before it's too late, csw has covered this a number of times.
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:36:09
I designed the coin in 2012 don't know why I used Troy think I initially was shooting for a silver version like the 1 gram bitcoin I did in 2011. I did a none bitcoin copper round first "globe &amp; gears" which had the correct "AV" 
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:38:25
Excellent research.
