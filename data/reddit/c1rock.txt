I sold some btc in 2013 and i self reported.  It was long tern gains by then.  Glad i did.  It was cheaper to pay the tax then, than now worry about a audit today. They will make a few examples. People will get fines and interest.

Kidnapp ya, and then cut off a finger.  Then ask you again to do such. Still no, cut off another finger.

I sold some coins to pay off my mortgage.  I am finally debt free.  Now you can not worry about the next nut to pay stuff.  Or dipping into savings.  
Being debt free and able to make moves in crypto will be good.

As more currency crisises happen in the world, people will figure a way out of their local currency. The dollar is one way.  Bitcoin is another if you cant get dollars.

I would take very small amounts.  You would be a target for kidnapping or getting shaked down for a bribe.

Bitcoin is a young man's game.  They go out and party over the weekend. Spend their satoshis on bottle service

If bitcoin goes to 100k. And fees are 2 sat/byte, in dollar terms it will be expensive.  Cant have it both ways.  High price is more in dollar terms expensive.  LN will be the game changer.

Screw giving out loans.  I am not a bank.  Now giving to others is always welcomed.  If you can help someone out of a jam, then do it.

I would let then fight it out.  Once someone goes broke, the malinvestment will be liquidated. Then life can move on.

What I seen is "I cant afford a whole bitcoin, but I can afford a whole bcash"  people think they need a whole coin. Or want a whole coin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:35:55
I agree.

I do IT services and web stuff. 
I get text messages all the time asking me if i do such work and do i accept credit cards.  I use to call them back, but the phone is never answered.  I text them back saying i tried to call.  
Then they text back saying they are deaf and cannot speak on the phone.   
I tell them i can do the job, but if you want to work like this over text messages, you have to pay me in bitcoin.
