i mean... if you can exist without a car, that's great and all, but having a car is great... especially for dating, girls do not want to be with a guy who doesn't drive most the time in america. Like once a girl hits 16 or 17, one of the most important things to her is the dude can drive. when a female hits 19-21, they care about the apartment, but a car is still important to have too.
also, 12/E an hour is near min wage in your country?
that's insane... min wage in my country has been in the 8usd range for the past few years.... i'd consider 12usd an hour to still be a low wage, but i wouldn't call it "near min wage". because you are still making 30-40% more then min wage, depending on your state. in less populated states min wage is even lower, but costs are much cheaper as well.
the fact you can get an apartment on 400E makes me jealous af.... i'd had to work 2 jobs 50-60 hours a week just to barely afford to live on my own in a 1bed 1 bath apartment, lowest prices being like 1100 near me... newer apartments are like 1200-1300.
tbh america's min wage is bullshit... you can't live on min wage without working 80+ hours a week, or living with someone else to split bills. and it's not exactly easy to convince a girl to date you and move out with you when you both making low wages and you still live at home since it's the only option.
man i wish i got some btc earlier in life but i've always been kinda broke... raised by a single mom, most i ever had at one time was 2000 dollars and both times it ended up getting used during times i had no job, had to buy a new car, etc. never really had money to invest in btc even though i always wanted to pick up a few since i first heard about it in 2011 or so.. i always had my doubts it was a ponzi scheme, but I even tried mining at one point... but it was slow and i didn't want to burn out my only gaming pc... mehh... i hate life &gt;.&lt; i tried mining litecoins too, wanted to pick pu some of those... same situation seemed too slow and i didn't like the stress on my only gaming rig...

there is clearly some details missing here.  like your rent was really paid to your parents to keep living at home for 200 a month.
you haven't been able to rent an apartment in NJ for under  800 dollars for almost 10 years. guy at my job last month told me he pays 500 dollars for a room in someone's house with no bathroom or anything.
how you can spend ~150 dollars a week on food and everything you need is insane. i can't see someone spending less then 50 dollars a week on food, 40 dollars a week to own a car, and 150 a week to rent an actual apartment in a smaller state. those costs alone would leave your savings down to 400-600 or so a month after taxes. and then assuming you have an apartment. i'm also assuming you had a phone bill, utilities bills, internet costs, so on and so forth. 
in fact, i will go as far as to say, i don't believe you at all and you are bullshitting somewhere here.
