The trick when you surface is to breath out when the tip of the snorkel is still pointing down, that way you aren't left with a bit of water in the u-bend. It took me years to realise this.

I thought the NFC hardware in the iPhone 6 was only available to the built in Apple Pay (i.e. third party apps can't use it). How is BitPay Checkout for iOS doing NFC communication?
Edit: The blog post doesn't state BitPay Checkout supports NFC on *all* mobile platforms, so perhaps that feature is Android only
Edit 2: It's Android only  As this demo video states: "NFC exclusive to Android".

There are probably many ways to do it. I surface face up and exhale as my head leaves the water.

As described in the forum  the Bitcoin GUI doesn't display under a 3D accelerated desktop. This includes Unity and Ubuntu Classic. To workaround this switch your session to "Ubuntu Classic (No effects)" and run Bitcoin there.

Transactions that are secure by their nature, not by the honesty/skill/vigilance of the bank/merchant.
What I mean is that every time I pay by credit card it's all or nothing. Either I hand over all the details necessary to take all the funds on that card, or I don't use that vendor. Essentially I'm relying on the honesty and competence of randomwebsite.com to only take the payment they say they will.
With Bitcoin I know they only receive that one transaction, no matter their intentions they can't take more than I specify.

Shot in the dark: are you running an ad blocker (e.g. AdBlock plus), a social widget blocker, or a Flash/plugin blocker?
Some web pages go into an endless loop waiting for whatever got blocked to load.

Is that a thermal printer you're using? How stable/durable are the print outs over a period of years?
