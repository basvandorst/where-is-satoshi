Agreed. I treat it as unappreciated gold. If at some point, some or more currencies fail, many will turn to bitcoin. At some point in the future, currencies will have to tie themselves to something of value (I speculate of course). In the "off chance" this happens, you will be owning the modern version of digital gold.

@_date: 2016-08-01 06:42:50
This is my theory, and I am a complete novice in the bitcoin field. It might happen suddenly or gradually. I use bitcoin more as a "end of the world" fund if the shit hits the fan than just pure investment. If the crash of 2008 happened today, I am quite sure bitcoin would be able to step in and at the very least be an alternative source of transactions. But I have a sneaking feeling that if another crash happens, it will be much worse than 2008 and probably something that can't be bailed out by government intervention.

It will be interesting to see what happens, but I think initially the btc price will fall if there is a market crash/global recession. This is because the need for cash goes up, so people will start liquidating anything they can (worst case scenario). This includes btc. 
However, if the USD fails, we could see a surge in the bitcoin price. When/how that can happen remains to be seen. As I see it, bitcoin is more regarded as a digital asset at this time, and not a currency. If the broader market falls, it will be treated the same. Until it is recognized as a challenger/alternative to USD, it won't "moon" the way we expect/want it to.

@_date: 2017-02-25 18:27:15
True, but in my view, it doesn't matter what size a hard fork would enable. It will never be enough. Segwit/Lightning enable scaling that is needed. I know the 1.7-2.1 mb block size increase is a good talking point but in the larger scale of things, it is lightning and side chains that are going to effectvely scale bitcoin. That is what annoys me with the argument from the BU crowd, though somewhat valid, they seem to have this urgency to transact cheaply and fast to be succesful. I think of all the innvations that will be attached to bitcoin that will be the *real* revolution. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:13:54
Are you saying that they (Bitmain/Jihan) see BU as unrealistic and instead want to put pressure on Segwit + 2MB hardfork compromise? 
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:29:03
This and the fact that by activating segwit they lose out on fees if lightning activates. At least in the short term. They're businesses, they think short term. I feel pro segwit side keeps forgetting the economic incentives for miners in the short term. But I also think a lot of the vocal support for BU has some sort of agenda. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:38:36
Yeah, scaling and all that is important. But the infrastructure is essential. If the decentralized infrastructure is built before it takes off, it will expose it to the rest of the world instead of becoming secondary to existing institutions.

Sceanrio 1.  ETF goes to exchanges to buy all their coins, impossible to predict price because it would rise so quickly. Hence, purchases would at some point stop due to the high price. 
Scenario 2.  ETF goes off market to purchase coins in bulk (miners etc) at a higher price, but won't impact the market as much because it is done off exchanges
Scenario 3.  I think the WV twins already have a shit load of coins that they are planning on using for the ETF.

Bitcoin wouldn't be worth shit if it wasn't for this fact. It is the underlying reason for investing in it early. Among all the other positive aspects. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:00:58
That migth be true, but the messaging from the BU crowd seems to be a lot of criticism of Core and that they have treated BU unfairly. I still think whoever is really behind BU (Jihan/Ver/shills) just uses BU to pressure Core into compromise. Not that I think a compromise would even be accepted. If Core proposed 2mb+ segwit hardfork, they would just move the goalposts and demand 4mb/8mb/whatever. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:50:14
That would be a very good reason for them to oppose it. Maybe Ver has a stake in BitMain too? Trying to find the incentives other than destroying bitcoin.

Do you have a source for this? Not doubting your claim, just finding it hard to find any good reasoning for opposing segwit based on economic incentives for miners. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:53:18
I don't know what the BU minions really want. I think that BU is a camp where people are free to be outraged. However, whenever discussing scaling (somewhat sensible discussion) with a BU supporter, it seems they are inclined to support 2mb + segwit hardfork. 
Full shift to BU is the initial proposal, 2mb +segwit is the compromise they are looking for. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:59:14
I don't think so. BU was created to put pressure on Core to force them to implement a block size increase so they could (for the forseeable future) double their income in fees. It's not working very well so their threats are getting louder. 
Ask any BU supporter if they would accept a Segwit + 2mb hardfork. All they want is this compromise, and they shouldn't get it. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:18:48
There's not enough power of any side to persuade each other. Only the market will decide, but the market must then indicate which it prefers. So let's see if BU gains any traction and the price rises. If so, expect to see more support for BU. Same for Segwit. In any scenario, the price needs to go down for a considerable amount of time to influence  the miners decision making.

It reminds me of something Andreas said in one of his talks. Paraphrasing: If you give me a 1TB block, I will back up my computer on the blockchain. 
Basically, any increase in availability of space will be filled. GPRS-&gt;3G-&gt;4G. I thought 3G was enough at the time, now I get pissed if I don't have 4G. If the blocksize limit is forked to 8MB, the space is going to get filled in no time at all. Then what? Fork it again?
2nd layer is the way to go. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:51:52
You mean the Chinese government starts buying bitcoin to raise the price? I don't think all miners are in 'cahoots' with Bitmain. They are just using the product and have to participate in a pool. From which they get their information/propaganda. Many others just run it as-is without signalling to segwit or bu. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The chinese government might be in cahoots with some individuals, but not all miners are. Unless China somehow threatens individual miners, or give out special mining liscenses, they are not actively trying to take over bitcoin. But divide and conquer seems to be working great. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:57:40
Picutre a scenario where the price goes to 600. Some random pool with 10 percent of the hashrate makes a big anouncement and switches to BU. The price takes a nosedive to 400. 
Then, some other pool makes an anouncement and starts signalling for Segwit. The price goes to 750. If a pool or the miners of a pool see a direct correlation between running SegWit and increasing the price of Bitcoin, they will all start signalling for SegWit. 
So, IMO, if you want Segwit activated, sell your coins and bring on the FUD. The market always decides, not Jihan, not Core, not nodes. If BU is going to drag the discussion into the mud (a LOT of people on the SegWit side are doing the same), so be it. Start slinging mud and sell your coins. Jack shit is going to happen as long as the price is at its current level. It is also the quickest way of activating SegWit, although it will still take time. If we go to the moon first, kiss SegWit good bye until someone comes up with mining equipment to blow Jihan out of the water. 
EDIT: H[ere are some actual figures]( 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:40:37
The point is, whatever the block size is, it will be filled up. So better to look at second layer solutions. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:41:40
I still think there is a rational (though dubious) explanation to why BU even exists. Which is to provide an alternative until they get a compromise for 2mb + segwit hardfork from Core. 
IMO this explains why they always refer to Core "treating them unfairly" etc etc. They play the victim so that eventually the community will put pressure on Core to appease them. Whenever anyone is in an argument with people from or a general BU supporter, ask if they would consider a 2mb+segwit hardfork compromise. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:41:58
Thanks for clearing that up!
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:03:09
Who cares about Core's reputation? They write code and present it. If you don't like it, don't run it. I don't see them as a political entity. I just don't get this argument of Core having a big head. A lot of people seem to respect core for their work. So if you have an issue, criticize the code. It's probably why satoshi stayed anonymous... so no one would criticize him/her/them and just focus on the code. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:34:19
I agree. But let's say BU "controls" the miners, how hard would it be for them to run a bunch of nodes supporting BU to gain traction? If the wanted to block a UASF, that is... 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:44:55
You say that miners care about core's reputation. Why? Why don't they just care about the code?
Your whole argument seems to boil down to the fact that the miners are butt hurt about the deal that was made and now you're saying that core is arrogant. 
I would tell miners to go and come up with their own code. Which they have. 
I get that they were promised one thing and were presented with another. But to go out and basically hold the whole network hostage because miners think that core is arrogant (I have yet to hear any valid criticism of the code) because they didn't get their way, is childish. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:47:28
I'm also a casual follower, but I try to see both sides. So let's say Core said they would increase the blocksize at the Hong Kong agreement. Then they roll out SegWit and say: "look, we already get a doubling of the blocksize effectively with SegWit"
However, this doesn't benefit the miners as they of course want more money. More fees in a block = more cash to pay for power, hardware, expansion etc. I get where the miners are coming from, I get they feel treated unfairly and SegWit now, increase blocksize later is something they just don't trust. 
Core wants to do what's best for Bitcoin, BU seems to want to do what is best for the miners. I think it is fair to say that Core doesn't give a damn what the miners think and that this is now a problem for implementing SegWit. Miners care about themselves, as they should. So why would they support SegWit? 2mb + segwit might be a compromise for most miners, but i doubt it is enough for Jihan. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:37:16
Can't they start up new nodes? Let's say there are 1000 nodes, can they start up 2000 new nodes to "overpower" existing ones? I am a technical noob, so forgive my ignorance on the subject. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:48:01
Yeah, if Core wants to implement segwit through the miners, then they will have to compromise. But who knows if all the miners will accept a compromise. My guess is no, they won't. They will demand BU or a higher blocksize limit. Or no limit. Or whatever. 


I fully disagree with this. Bitcoin works as is. It's not great, it's slow, expensive etc. IMO, it's a small price to pay to be able to have an unregulated currency that is open to anyone in the world. It wouldn't bother me to stay at this level for at least another year. I would rather have staus quo than try to HF with what has been described as "buggy BU code". 
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:26:53
BU never intended that their version would be used. They know their code is inferior. They just want to pressure core (whining about censorship, arrogance of core, HK deal, satoshi's "vision", threat of their own code) into compromise. They want double the fees. Segwit kinda fucks that up in the short term. 
My theory anyway 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:06:15
Disagree. Deadlock is fine, I am still able to use bitcoin. Maybe the fees are a little higher, but I would rather have bitcoin in its current form over a hard fork. 
Satoshi did the right thing in disappearing. Anyone can be corrupted, even Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:30:42


This is why Andreas is great. He breaks it down in simple terms. I have yet to hear a bad opinion from him. 
What does this mean? I hope the bitcoin price starts tanking. It is the short term price hodlers have to pay. If the price gets to maybe 600 and stays there, miners will start to wake up and get annoyed. The more FUD coming out of BU, the better it is for SegWit. Miners care about money, if the bitcoin price is low because of FUD, they will start to flirt with the idea of SegWit. My 2 cents anyway
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:05:00
I don't think that is true. While reading his post, imagine that he is talking about Core and how they're the ones that are power hungry. THAT is what they believe. Or pretend to believe.

@_date: 2017-03-14 13:15:58
I think that it is the order that is in dispute. Segwit +LN then increase blocksize is the Core position IIRC

They (I assume) believe that if they put 2x into the deal, the miners would sign on and when the time comes to fork, no one will because of substandard code etc. Even the miners knew this, hence bcash. Even they don't believe in the 2x part.

@_date: 2017-04-20 19:18:08
Miners and devs can't communicate on this because they have different incentives. The miners want to pressure the devs to code a hardfork. They won't do it. The miners (you know who) then say fuck it, we'll make our own code and promote it and then play the victim when shit goes sour. Why wont't Core just code a hardfork for us? They don't understand, or pretend not to understand, that "Core" isn't a company with a CEO. 
Should "Core" apologize to the miners? No. A hardfork is risky and a bad idea and trying to pressure "Core" to do it is counter productive.  
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:19:28
So it will depend on miners either all switching to bitmain to benefit off the exploit (unlikely), or try to activate segwit so that bitmain loses its competitive advantage. Too bad the price keeps rising. It incentives "do nothing "

The answer is, as always, follow the money. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:50:05
My question is, how will other miners react? I know I'd be pissed. Is it in their best interest to signal SegWit or do nothing? 
A lot of talk about how it is "wrong" of Jihan to do this, but this is the economic real world. IMO the best case option is that other miners retaliate by signalling for SegWit
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:42:16
There needs to be an immediate correlation between Bitcoin price and the implementation of SegWit. Just because we all *believe* that the price would soar, does not mean the miners see it this way. If a pool switches to SegWit and the price immediately shoots up 100 USD on this news, we would probably see more adoption.
In the case of the ASICBOOST, is there any incentive for miners to adopt SegWit if they are not using BitMain?
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:56:04
The more miners switch to SegWit, the more (hopefully) the price rises. If this correlation continues, more miners will switch to SegWit. This can switch fast. We could have a situation where everyone is signalling SegWit except Jihan which will put enormous pressure on them to start signalling. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:26:46
Misinformation and misdirection. I can't for the life of me find a rational argument opposing SegWit. But yeah, this kind of hostility isn't helping but then again, nothing will. Might as well yell and scream at each other as we wait for the market to decide.

@_date: 2017-04-07 11:03:12


Understandable, but then again, all alts have gone up in value. Difficult to attribute the price rise solely because of segwit signalling.


There still isn't an immediate effect. I attribute most of the miners actions to short term profit. In terms of Antpool and the others using the ASSICBOOST exploit, this is perfectly understandable. In regards to other miners, signalling SegWit would be to undermine miners who use Bitmain rigs and Antpool to end their advantage and thus allocating more hashing power to other miners. Makes sense, but we'll have to see if this actually plays out. 
 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:35:59
Bitcoin is certainly proving it's point, only a hard fork could really hurt right now. All the FUD and the attacks are just noise. Bitcoin works great the way it is and there are major markets for it in it's current form. Especially cross country payments. I don't expect there to be another major upgrade for another few years to be honest. The price doesn't look to be falling either. It just keeps chugging along

My own personal theory based on nothing more than a hunch, is that bitcoin will *become* "gold". As in, central banks will be forced to pin their own currency to bitcoin. That way (I think) they will be able to control their own currency supply and regulate the national economy according to its needs while still being pegged/pinned to something. 
I remember the issues a couple of years ago with Ireland unable to lower their own interest rates nationally to stimulate its economy since the interest rate is controlled by the european central bank. I guess this is still the case in several countries like Greece.

How did this work back in the gold standard days? Was it impossible to inflate and manipulate the currency because it was pegged to gold? 
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:07:37
So therein lies the dilema I guess? If Bitcoin or other crypto currencies are to become the norm, the whole economic model has to be adjusted and countries can no longer independently stear their economies.

I'm no economist and understand only the basics of bitcoin, but what would the investment world look like with a deflating currency like bitcoin? IMO the markets the last 10-15 years has been overstimulated with low interest rates to generate investments, if Bitcoin is constantly deflating, what investments look like? 
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:48:48
TL;DR: Short term: bad time. Long term: Good time.
Bitcoin is still viewed as a risky investment and not a hedge, even though a lot of maximalists (myself included) view it that way. Unless the USD starts rapidly losing value, there is no objective reason for money in the stock market to exit and enter bitcoin as long as they can just buy USD or bonds. 
If there is a run on Wall Street, there will also be a run on bitcoin. Cash is still king, so people will liquidate whatever they can to get cash. 
IMO the "Bitcoin is a hedge" notion only applies when fiat currencies fail.

What i think is possible for the corporate world to take from bitcoin, is encryption. So whenever someone says that blockchains will “revolutionize “ some industry, i always think they mean encryption.

Either way, you would have to convert USD to Rupees. Buying and/or selling currency you will always lose out on a percentage. For this to be accurate, the exchange premium charged by the bank/exchange would also have to be included. And when it boils down to it, the premium is probably the difference in waiting a couple of days to exchange since the price is so volatile. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:23:51

That's the real play here. Delay, pump price, profit. However, if the price does go parabolic in the meantime, does this not incentivize other chip manufacturers? If bitmain gets some tough competition because of the price rise, bitmain would lose their market share.

@_date: 2017-05-30 10:39:48
Calling it. Bitmain is going to make some absurd statement and take credit if they don't get any compromises. The only reason he is stalking is because of ASICBOOST and his monopoly on mining equipment. He wants to be relevant and have power so he's doing all he can to at least get something out of it. Last on that list is credit. If he takes credit for switching, then he has lost on all points.

You just called yourself "the big block community". Do you stand by Bitmain and Ver? If yes, you are part of what divides bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-10-12 12:01:59
You might be right, as in bitcoin is undeveloped land with a lot of potential. Once the infrastructure is in place, you can start to market it for what it is/can be worth. But people still need to see value in it.

The argument against the 2x part should be the timeline. 3 months is too short of a time and I think participants (at least some) in the NYA are banking on Core contributing to the 2x part.... which they won't. After that I predict one by one, signatories in the NYA start pulling their support for the hard fork.

So one guy on reddit suddenly exposes Bitmain's plans? There is enough outrage about Segwit2X.

@_date: 2017-06-20 15:38:08
The whole NYA agreement was just for show, but I do suspect that they got the industry together to be able to pressure the miners to signal for Segwit. If the industry threatens to join UASF148, it would take away the power of the miners. So they compromise and (hopefully) pretend to give into the 2x bullshit. Promote it even though opposed by Core. Which is great, because now they don't have to claim any responsibility for the stupid hard fork that was bestowed upon them. Jihan gets to keep some pride, even though he can't help himself and announces yet another stupid hard fork. 
After Segwit activates, I believe Silbert and Lingham will change their tone. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:51:40
I think they're just trying to scare the community away from BIP 148. However, it may have the opposite effect as they are now announcing that they will hardfork. Forcing the silent majority to pick a side, which I think will back fire. Their best play IMO was to downplay BIP 148 and claim that no one takes it seriously. Now they indirectly confirm that they DO take it seriously and are prepared to act against it. So, let's see what the rest of the mining community does.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:41:03
I think that is their last ditch attempt. A bluff. Watch them fold and signal segwit either before or after August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:31:18
Depends on the market. If 148BTC is valued more than JihanCoin, mining power will shift from JihanCoin to 148BTC. Miners will have to make a choice, because doing nothing means mining the legacy coin that is in danger of being wiped out. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:24:19
It really becomes a game of chicken. So we'll see who has the balls to move. I personally think the miners will not be able to coordinate and make a collective decision before August 1st. In that case, divide and conquer. Those who scare easily, will signal SegWit or BIP148 or any of the other instead of fighting as per the scenarios in this article. But BIP148 also has to gain enough traction before that time to be a credible threat. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:05:39
Very true, we'll see how the market reacts prior to August 1st. So far it doesn't seem that the market cares either way. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:25:24
In my limited understanding, yes. I guess the thought is that no one will actually run the 2X part. 1 because it doesn't exist yet, and 2 because why would you want to run a hard fork unless the whole community is behind it? Jihans asicboost days are numbered. So I think his whole hard fork jihan coin announcement was a last ditch effort to derail any type of progress. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:12:27
At, let's say, 100 USD a coin, I would buy a bunch of coins. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:39:34


So is this a legitimate scenario? How much would they lose in terms of hashpower if asicboost is disabled through BIP 148? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:01:49
I still think the 2x part is just to appease the miners and have them save face. The rest signed the agreement to get Segwit activated and avoid having to take a stance on BIP148. I don't think they (most of the parties involved in the NYA) intend to go through with the 2x part, but it could come back and bite them in the ass after Segwit finally gets activated. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:29:07
Well, it will be their turn to be on the other end of stalling. I don't have much sympathy for them
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:15:23
Worst case for UASF supporters is that August 1st comes and passes without anything happening. This is also the best case (IMO) for Bitmain. I can't rationally explain why Bitmain have made this threat other than BIP148 scaring the shit out of them. That and ego. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:31:51
Yeah, BIP148 is also a new playing field without ASICBoost where miners have a bigger chance of having a level playing. Anything for a competitive edge. It depends also if some start signalling before or after August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:41:33
That may be the case, but in that case they would have forked off a long time ago. This is in direct response to UASF, and as we saw with the Litecoin round table, I still believe this is just a poorly thought out threat. Which will back fire. They have been in control for so long that even if the UASF is not successful, it might be successful next time. 
I still think their best strategy would have been to downplay/ignore the UASF, instead of now calling more attention to it and forcing the industry to make a choice. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:54:01
This is the one I believe. I think most of them (I think there were more) were on the same page in that, once they understood the implications this could have, the easiest way to discredit bitcoin would be to go after and smear the creator(s). It had to be anonymous. Nick Szabo + Hal Finney + probably more. They would never be able to take credit, that was a trade off to keep bitcoin truly free and to test the game theory. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:44:49
So, unless I am mistaken, BIP 148 can kick inn with 51% hashrate supporting it. I don't know how much Segwit singalling is now. 25-30%?
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:31:01

@_date: 2017-06-20 09:41:41
Yeah, ASICBoost is profitable but having a stable/high Bitcoin price is more profitable. If there is a chain split (BIP148) the price could plummet and i think hurt more than ASICBoost can make up. 
Segwit2X is just to save face. I don't think many in this group actually expect there to be a 2X hard fork within the NYA time frame 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:32:53
And if "everyone" dusted off their miners and ran them, would it make enough of a dent in the hashrate to increase the difficulty?
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:57:14
And that's probably why Silbert and Lingham have been supporting Segwit2X. To let the Chineese miners save face. I don't think anyone should believe 2X is going to happen. But it will give the miners something to bitch about after Segwit locks in. 
We get Segwit, the chinese miners can't blame Core because no one from Core supported it. So the miners can only turn on anyone involved in the NYA. 
I'd chalk this up to a 90% win for anyone supporting SegWit
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:17:19
yeah, but i doubt anyone will be actually running the 2x code when the time comes. Just let's all celebrate and pat each other on the back for getting SegWit. Let's all pretend to go along with the 2x plan and then just not honor it.
