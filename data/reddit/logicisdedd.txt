It doesn't help the cause to make a false statement. It just discredits People Like Us in the eyes of the general population. I understand where you're coming from, but somebody who believes in the powers-that-be is just going to see what you said and think "That is actually not the truth. Why should I listen to that guy if he makes false claims? He probably will tell me more untrue things"

The article would imply that 80% of ceos are not psychopaths. So where do we reach the point where we are saying "most" billionaires are the problem? That is quite the logical leap.

I would appreciate if you would post evidence to support the claim that "most" billionaires are psychopaths.
I bet you can't. Sounds to me like you are making assumptions about people you don't know. 
You're also using a very misleading example. There exist organizations of b/millionaires that organize AGAINST tax breaks for the rich. It is misleading to say that, because some billionaires vote for tax breaks for themselves, "most" billionaires are psychopaths.

That's fair.
New thought: does it really matter if BTC is private or not in the end?
Couldn't people use transparent BTC to buy things like houses while using something like Monaco for general spending?
So when you want a transaction to e publically verifiable, it will be. And when you want it to be private, it still will be. 
That said, I still value privacy 100%.

I'm curious what the rule is. Are you supposed to report any financial instruments that you own, or just ones you are traveling with? 
If the first, shouldn't bank accounts be included?
And if the second, if you memorize your keys are you truly traveling "with" a financial instrument? Or are you just traveling as a person with the knowledge required to access his funds as needed?

I don't understand how this works. If you have 100k in a bank account, you don't have to report that. Right? I am under the impression that only cash is to be reported
And if that is the case, why should $100k of bitcoin in a wallet need to be reported? Especially if you're not carrying the physical representation nor a hardware wallet?
Is there a fundamental difference here that I am missing, or is it just a crappy double standard?
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:08:29
Guess I don't. Though I am open to learning. 
If I send 1 blacklisted BTC to a tumbler, and then to a wallet, and then to an exchange, how could anybody know which 1 BTC is the blacklisted 1 BTC?
If I send 1 blacklisted BTC to a wallet with .5 BTC, and then I send .5 BTC to a friend, how is the blacklisted currency identified
Does blacklisting happen with cash? I know bills have been tracked bv serial # so they could follow where drug money goes. Does the BTC blockchain contain any information like that which could legitimately be used to blacklist specific Bitcoins (for lack of a better term)?

Your new argument seems to forget the 80% figure you mentioned previously. Not every business model works that way, and it's misleading to pretend that they do.
To answer your question though, a business can make a profit while paying people what they are worth because the collective power of a group is stronger than the inputs of the individuals. A McDonald's store will likely be significantly more time and resource efficient than 10 people trying to start their own one-man burger businesses with no industry connections, business knowledge, or streamlined processes. Resources are something we all have to share, so efficiency in that way benefits not only a business owner, but the world at large. And on top of that, many more mouths get to eat as a result of all of the efficiency. (I know the food is unhealthy but that's not what I'm getting at here)
