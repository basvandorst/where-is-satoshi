I read this and it had me really take a step back and think.... do I want a caramel frappe from McDonald’s or a McFlurry.

What if that rumor of bitmain putting in a malware that can disable all the miners they have sold ? Long shot but is that possible? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:30:53
To upgrade ? People still make money at the current btc rate and would make just that much more when we get back to the 18k range... totally not a bad investment if you think long term and not at the level of day trading and “fast money” but thanks for your input.

How did you translate that out of what I said? I’m just saying if you have been looking at certain coins and researching and didn’t have enough money to get in at the up trend pricing this crash would allow you to invest into coins at a better price? “Bro” ok? Lol like calm down and I’m not 18 . If it has serious “real life “ consequences then maybe if it’s affecting you that much your in over your head . “Bro” ok ? Thanks again for your input “Bro”

Lol I at times suffer from this as well but it’s less stressful to not keep checking and just enjoy life 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:32:22
Gotcha , considering that rig didn’t cost u much it’s not too bad. I have 2 Antminer S7s and I make about 20-25$ a day. But my setup cost a lot more then yours.  I am selling both of my S7s if your interested [2x Antminer s7 On Ebay](

I mine about $25 a day at current prices running both machines . I can prove that it’s not a problem at all. If someone is interested they can message me and I can show them that in the long run these are still profitable

I never said anything about investing everything I have into just bitcoin? My edit clearly says alt coins as well . The best way to reduce risk of investments is to diversify your portfolio ... but ok I guess my post came across totally wrong

Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it... but yea troll me on my birthday cake post . Awesome 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:53:00
In time the transaction fees will get smaller and as far as the plateau your referring too I mean I few weeks ago bitcoin was around 12k and today it’s around 17k so it definitely coming back . Maybe not lightning speeds but it’s getting there . Bitcoin is a long term investment not a get rich overnight coin. Buy the dips and HODL I’m sure by Jan 6th of 2019 you will be much happier with your investment in bitcoin . ( and by me saying I’m sure I really mean I hope so and fingers crossed)

What? lol no. Take one power supply... where did u come up with that? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:25:55
No, if u check the listing you can see the black and yellow cables are the power cables that plug into the miner from one power supply 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:31:08
If you looked at the listing it clearly shows one power supply per s7...
