Saving may be good, but not absolutely and with no limit. There is a time preference of goods, more immediate is better than more remote in time. It has to be like that, from the nature, else everybody would save and their life would stop. The hamster would store its food forever and never eat. The time preference is necessary for life.
The idea that money must depreciate in value, is just a lie put forward from those who earn from the current working of the money system. They print more, or counterfeit the money, sells them for real stuff, and you lose.
You could counter it by having your value in real stuff like housing. You see that this is reinforced in times with hyperinflation. But then bubbles will occur in the real stuff (that does not have good money properties), and you might lose anyway

First it is unlikely that some foreign government will do, because having their own fiat money type is a sign of sovereignty, translated: Using money printing and other mechanisms related to it, local fiat is a way to fund the state in a roundabout way which  the subjects don't easily understand. Bitcoin, being sound, would totally pull the rug under such a plan.
Some countries depend on the dollar as their local money, but they didn't do that because they wanted, they did it because their previous money system was destroyed. Even Equador, where the dollarization was by decree, not only by market forces, mulls the thought of reestablishing their own. Currently it seems not to be possible. Zimbabwe tries again these days, but they will probably not succeed, their new system is already tanking, days later.
But even if some country against all odds institutes Bitcoin as the national currency, other countries would not automatically regard it as money. Making it an asset in the local tax regime is a way for them to say fuck you to Bitcoin. They hate it for the same reason, and they will fight it will all means they have at their disposal, the the tax regime and propaganda.

Make sure you get the fiat first, or at least have it on a table. You soon get a feel for the other person. It is no problem, done it hundreds of times.
With localbitcoins.com you also have the option of escrow, it is not necessary imo, but you can use it the first time per customer. If not you just cancel the trade on localbitcoins and do the trade directly

Fiat is the dollars. Ahh, I see you want to buy. In that case you have to put the dollars on the table first, then the seller sends coins to you. I recomment having your own wallet like mycelium, instead of receiving coins to a site like localbitcoins (unless you go for localbitcoins.com and escrow, which is ok because you see the coins in your localbitcoins.com wallet immediately)

It is fundamentally the same, a gold miner must also expend roughly 1 USD minus the general social level of profit. The difference is, that while bitcoin miners have a 3-6 months perspective, gold mining cost follows gold price with about 10 years lag, therof 5 years of waiting to see that the new price sticks before they invest. A few of the gold bugs in the blogosphere know this, but not all. With bitcoin it is quite easy to observe

It will happen, but not due to governments and the elite, it will happen against their will becaue it is in the interest of the individual.
Here is my thinking: Bitcoin  is low value, and used only marginally, because of low liquidity (difficult to sell and big amount can move the exchange or saturate the local market, including there are not so many different people to sell the money to). But even when fiat, specially us dollar in the international market, is far more liquid, bitcoin increases its liquidity. The explanation is that it really is the best form to buy certain things, and usage for those things will increase when information spreads, and *when everybody involved in those trades use cryptomoney, the liquidity has increased, which opens new kind of trades to be advantageous for bitcoin* . Therefore one or more of the crypto money types will take over everything.
But this will happen whatever governments do. When everybody wants to use it, it will be impossible to prohibit it.

You can regard it as no inflation, by counting coins found and not yet found together, hard money. This is sensical, because everybody knows the plan.
If you choose to condsider only found coins, there is an inflation (in the number of money units) as someone else described. The purpose is the initial distribution of coins. It is fair, because everybody must buy them or mine them for approximately the same price.
The inflation comes out as block subsidy. It is needed for the safe operation of the system, the block subsidy is paid by current holders through the reduced value due to the inflation (the other source of payment is fees paid by people who want to transact)

It would make it fiat, but it could not happen because governments have nothing to win from bitcoin. Expenses the government have are covered in three ways: Taxes, inflation and loans. They like it to be hidden, so inflation and loans are preferred. Loans has to be continually increasing to make it a source of income. Loans increase the apparent money unit number in a suble way, 
Hard money will take away the inflation and also reduce the ability to borrow. Therefore there will be no government bitcoin-like cryptomoney. All proposed systems have both inflation and even more control than the current bank money/cash systems. The talk about government embracing/regulating is just noise.
Bitcoin is hard money, it is like cash in that it actually resides in your phone wallet, and goes directly from phone to phone, and it transcends national borders. They really hate it. That is also why we love it. Bitcoin will change your view of governments, they are blood-sucking parasites.

Well Bitcoin is not a currency anywhere yet, but it is money. (You got the meaning of money and currency reversed), currencies are the most liked money in an area or a type of business).


No government helped create Bitcoin, it was done without any regulation, you could say that (in addition to the inventor) it was created by the market.
Then: No alleged authority has ordered people to use Bitcoin, which fiat means, therefore it is not fiat.
In addition, it is sound money, which means that noone has got their bitcoins for free, they have either bought them on the market or mined for approximately the same cost. There is no seigniorage.
The market has also decided that it regards noninflationary cryptomoney like Bitcoin to be the best, somewhat like gold but even harder, with the max coin number. You could also easily include this trait in the sound money definition.

The idea was to peg it to oil. A desperate idea, but theoretically workable, but only if there is an organization that guarantees to redeem coins for the stuff to anybody, and of course they must have it.
This has not been adequately explained or proclaimed yet.
A better idea is just to make an altcoin, but that would be futile, because the point of the whole thing is to steal value from the money, so they would print ad infinitum just like the bolivar fuerte.
An even better idea would be to use a real sound cryptocoin like bitcoin, ethereum or bitcoin cash, but see above, there would be no point in that for the dominators because there is no seigniorage.
So the whole thing is as important as a careless comment from any politician. Basically, ignore it.
Edit: It works for a while, but this is what happens: The bank prints a coin, buy the stuff, prints a new coin, buys more stuff ... until all the stuff is owned by the bank.

First, there is the question of the address type: If it was a legacy address it is recoverable (by the owner of the receiving wallet), but it needs some work (suggest, use a bitcoin cash compatible wallet software like Electron Cash, import the secret key for the receiving address, or the whole seed).
If is was a seqwit address, the situation is not completely clear to me, see todays discussions. Miner help will be needed at the least, and the miner would want a cut.

In 6 months it has been impossible to salvage those coins, now, with the change of 15th may 2019 it is possible again. A miner can in theory move the coins back to the sending address or anywhere else, but an attempt from a miner to move everything to himself was thwarted by other miners reorging 2 blocks. The discussion was what was right, the code, or the other miners preventing the incident. What will happen, is unclear to me, maybe noone dare move those coins after this. In the period before 15.th of november 2018 at least one miner had an offer to salvage the coins. You will have to follow the discussion. A friend of mine have the same problem, it was supposed to be sale of bitcoin cash, but the buyer presented a bitcoin address, and both being unexperienced, warnings from the wallet software were ignored. So yes, there is a bit of confusion.
