Wagecan is a Hong Kong based bitcoin company that offers bank accounts for U.S. customers. They pay 4% on bitcoin balances and allow transfer from bitcoin to USD in debit card account which they maintain in your name. 
I do not have a card with them, though I do enjoy their 4% (not compounding) interest, which apparently they making through arbitrage.
The transfer from BTC to USD takes on business day, which is faster than Circle or Coinbase selling, because they control both accounts and are floating the sale.

I do not think closing an account sends as much a message as just not using them. Coinbase maybe trying to track funds, but likely is Circle. The real difference was Circle honors deposits instantly and Coinbase does not without further verification. Since Circle came on the seen, Coinbase has take a back seat. 
I do not see any reason to break up with them, if they have not broke up with me or my credit unions or online banks.

It is always one or more of the following; 
- blockchain.info is behind
- Fee, priority estimated within 6 blocks (1hr)
- Transaction was included in orphaned block, wait for another block
Don't sweat it. If quicker confirmation is of the most urgency, hike up the miners fee. There is also a way to double spend the transaction and wipe out the first, but I do not recommend it. Search the other ledger sites for your transaction.

Just don't use Blockchain.info to validate. They are constantly behind or flat wrong.
If you see the transaction as send on one device and received on the other, you can sleep well that it will be included in the next few blocks and I would not wait for any set number of transactions.

You could do it so many ways too. From jpg images of qr codes, to .dat files, to js local wallets, to straight up apps. 
The worry I have with ledger, trezor and the like is, the fear they will not be there in 2 years or a component breaks in the device. But with a multi-million production device like a phone, much of those fears are eliminated.

Auto invest is a bad idea. Not because you have to account for fraud, but because it encourages the creation of fraudulent loans.
On any p2p lending sites, there will be fraud, but the collective figures out the obvious and most will not bite. But with blind autoinvesting the collective is funding these loans. Thus creating the incentive to create more like loans and more time efficiency for fraud.

China mines have favorable environments for mining when it comes to electricity (hydro), labor, rent, and equipment.

You can have more than one email address on file. Have the active transaction sent to an email dump. Set up and email to not save email. Yes the transaction will be sent through their SMTP servers, but will at least not be archived on your end. And if you control the address, you can always switch it on later or update the email address in circle.
This brings up the bigger question of why we (most people) are still using insecure email. You can control your side, go can pgp all outgoing messages, but you can not control the security of income message or what receivers do once they unencrypted your message.
We need to roll out Bote by I2P across the web in general. And don't say bitmessege, it is not the answer.

True. The things I mentioned were more like those who sold doves and the banks who own the Federal Reserve and other central banks (as depicted in image) are the money changers.

The simplest answer is usually the correct one. Gov't powered individuals let the power corrupt them. They stole, because they thought they could.

Gov't need a warrant to confiscate paper wallets. Gov't need a warrant confiscate hardware wallets. 
I suppose any web-based hot wallet, with some third party control may be confiscated under this edict.
Multi-sig to the rescue!

I was in a similar position to once. I bought single stocks, getting in and out of companies once a month or so. The market was different them. I could not do that now. I do not see clear €1000 investments. 
Gamble. Through it on bitcoin. I love silver too, but it is not an investment, it is a story of wealth. Bitcoin is both, but also a currency.
So the ultimate investment is to dumb €1k into btc and then look for things to invest in with it.
