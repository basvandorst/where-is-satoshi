I love the people that have fun gambling on bitcoin

I believe they are saying the chart is representing a trend that is not in alignment with some of the factors that set the trend is BTC use in real market terms and that the data is somewhat cherry picked to represent the trend in the first place.

Perhaps but the prices are (supposedly) not the lowest trading vales and the price trend with a year as volatile as 2018 it presents an unreasonable trend comparison by potentially floating the stats.  As there are not many trading years for BTC I don't really know how else you would do it.  
Personally, I have seen these trends before for new tech stocks and tech penny.  It's not really a good way to determine useful value.  Could be better or worse than trend indicates.

Ya I totally agree and that should continue.  I have a fair amount of BTC as well.  My comments are only about what people were originally complaining about on this thread and what I focus on more than the price trend to predict where I think it is going.  I dont, and won't, day trade my coin.  
I think it has a lot of growth potential and that this potential is more linked to it's market penetration and general use than it's traded value.  It's a personal perspective.
There is too much hype I feel from people buying it to quick sell and expand the value via trading.

Be wary of this as there have been some issues regarding deposit fraud as it is rare to have the right escrow set up for BTC.

Not entirely sure how it works either.  Been thinking about it since my last reply and, for someone not risk adverse, they might be interested in selling the property with BTC on speculation?  If someone is considering BTC as a long play the would essentially be selling at today's price (I would expect at a profit) and then selling the BTC in the future for an additional return.  
Sounds risky but interesting.  I think to make it work the closing lawyer would have to have a BTC escrow wallet and transfer the coin in person or livecast to show funds in that wallet we're deposited by the buyer.  Then it would operate like a traditional closing with the wallet funds and separate funds transferred along with the title? 
It's the anonymity that would cause problems I think.

I agree that the market is growing.  Not really debating that but without a strong use case for the currency its growth should slow or stop.  That's why I think there should be more emphasis on market data on transactions outside of trading to prove future potential more accurately.
