Yup will surely do that next time, COD 4 is still one of the classics played by many, Will surely do a Global Offense tournament after this or may be sooner :)

People are having trouble with 0.005 BTC Right now so I think may be next time it will be possible.

could you give an example here of what other hacks might be possible except the cheats, cheats will be disabled on the server so it will make sure those aren't used except these two hacks mostly used I think there is not much to look for. I am also having talks with another trusted guy from forum so he can spectate too. And in future may be livestream the match.
Aimbotting and Walling will be only on the look out.

ok I have made a small change, I have made people chose the map from the list you provided, The map with most votes will be chosen.
I will look into the team thing, As I was thinking the same, this is not COD, Team vs Team would be better.

I have contacted leets admin, I cant create my own server for the game so there you have it. Until there is something from admin its not the option for now

Next tournament will be Counterstrike plus COD 4 Stay tuned ;)

Read the thread ;) Cheater will lose everything and its PvP so it will be very easiy to manage :)

I am thinking of 2 teams of 4 players. What maps do u want? You can always recommend :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:39:41
It will be a Player vs Player Game and the ip will be given to only those players. And I will be spectating both the players to make sure no aimbots/wallhacks were used. Cheats would be disabled by default.

There you have it guys, As you asked for it :) Hopefully this is the first step to something big for bitcoin and e-gaming.

People are having trouble for 0.005 BTC I think we need a slow start may be next time we can do that :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:06:18
Checkout the thread :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:05:52
I am working on that too, To make a server which can detect wallhack/aimbotting automatically. Its easy I think if the first one goes good we can surely work for something bigger :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:46:05
We have 2 entrants already! Come on guys only 14 more and we have the first tournament, Next one I am thinking of around 0.25 BTC
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:50:45
Yup I am thinking to replace it with Counter strike as almost zero interest in cod, But I still don't know if that will be better than this
