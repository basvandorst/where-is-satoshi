Tempting as it is to beg for rent.  But would you consider giving to the arts?  I am a music teacher in the state of Missouri and joined bit coin way to late to make anything really significant.  but what little I have made has gone back to my choir classroom for supplies, music, piano tuning, etc.  There are lots of good "for the arts" causes to support!

Sounds like you just wait for Seagate and cross your fingers.   Good luck man.   
There are other data recovery people out there.  But Seagate could further wipe the drive or do something where it makes the job harder for future recoveries.

I bought at 19200 thinking I was making a smart move. . . . 
Now we at 18600 boys.   
Hodling i guess. . . . .  If it got that high before.  hopefully it will go back there again.

I got my buddies at college to use FireChat,  it caught on and now the whole campus uses it.  Even though it's only 1300 students,  it's amazing to see all the chat rooms.  During the day there are a ton of them!  We use it to pass information, announcements, organize parties ;),  gossip,  just be a huge network of people.  It's truly amazing to see at work.  No need for data connection,  or any of that.  Just the over lapping signals used.

It's declining my card but my card is on their list of allowed companies.... I'll just wait for the bank verification? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:41:14
Using A wallet on my mobile device for now.   Waiting for my bank account to show the verification funds.   Trying to get on this train while I can.  I am kicking myself hard for not doing it sooner :(

Is it safe to use coinbase but transfer my coin to wallet on my phone/computer.  Then transfer back when I want to sell?

But I need a quick buck. . . . 5 bucks to my name?  Riding on my initial investment of 100 bucks.   Rise baby rise.
