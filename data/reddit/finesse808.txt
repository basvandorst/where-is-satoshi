Thank you for recommending the real sports episode. And that wouldn't be a bad idea, maybe we should get started on that.
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:46:14
They are all regular people. And regular people are broke right?

Corda, IBM's fabric, I don't know what else to say. You keep talking about cryptocurrency, im talking about the service that is blockchain.
Edit: if im missing something please let me know and dont attack me.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:41:34

OH FUCK YEAH! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:52:56
Hes wrong. Hes completely confusing the two ideas. A blockchain does not need to track transactions, it can just be a historical database. Look up IBM's Ledger Fabric software. They have been the leading tech giant in the blockchain industry and their software does not use tokens. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:49:40
Blockchain != cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency USES blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:58:44
Imagine if you were bitcoin rich AND an addict!
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:35:02
Bitcoin is safe because of the blockchain...
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:43:41
I'd love to know why you give it that nickname.

They have such nice clean cash over there, like they take pride in it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:27:16
I'm just glad your still here with us. It's never too late to reach the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:46:45
Blockchain is a database as you are literally chaining blocks of data together. That's all it is. You should dive deeper into the tech of crypto before you spread misinformation. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:28:07


My point is that blockchains don't rely on tokens.
