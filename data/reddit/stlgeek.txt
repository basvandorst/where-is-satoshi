It's [mastercard outside the US](

I wrote of a recent order [here](


I pre-ordered a 30GH/s unit in April, and didn't get it until November. Yeah, that's bullshit, but I got it.

This attack seems to have done it:
Hashrate on Stratum interface (30 min average):	 0.000 Ghash/s (0%)
Approx. cluster performance (30 min average):	 0.000 Ghash/s

Too expensive how?  Bandwidth?  HDD/CPU?

No.  I got an amazon gift card this week is USD.  Amazon.de won't take it.  I chatted with Gyft last night and they said that they only offer cards in USD, but that they expect to add Euro (at least) "sometime next year".
Also, a US amazon prime membership doesn't work outside of the US.  You have to get a separate account for each continent/region.

Sorry, but I've been meaning to do this for a while...
I pre-ordered a 30GH/s unit in April, and didn't get it until November.  Yeah, that's bullshit, but I got it.
I will say it is operating a bit on the slow side, running at 20GH/s according to BTCguild, but ~30GH/s according to BFGminer.  I'm half way around the world, so trying to tweak it is not really possible.  On the upside, I ordered a day before they doubled the price.
Seeing the returns coming in and the price of BTC at the end of November, I ordered a 60GH/s unit.  It arrived promptly (within a week) and is running at a steady 60GH/s for the last month.
I'm not really praising BFL (I had already contacted Paypal several times re: fraud up until I got my shipping notice on the 30GH unit), but when they have inventory, it ships promptly, and so far, I've not had much trouble with the delivered hardware.
So, again, not praising, not trash-talking..  Just my uneventful account of two purchases.  In the end, this was really the only reasonably priced hardware available in the near term.
Will I make my money back?  Probably not, but it was "fun".

What area?  I'm near Cologne and use KSK (Sparkasse).  I can give it a try.  As long as they don't close your account over it, like in the US.
