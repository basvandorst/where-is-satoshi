Still you think that BTC is the real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:10:28
And? What with this information that my account was created no long time ago? Is this the reason that I cannot say true? Give me a break...
I have seen many "experienced" people who failed due to the reason that they well so self confident about their right coming from the experience. 
Times are changing, nothing last forever. 
BCH is the right bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:09:06
This is the reality of LN.
No more, no less. It works only in theory.
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is. 
BTC funs. Open your eyes and don't be stubborn. BCH is the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:52:59
It is not a scam. Scam is a silent killer. Bitcoin Core is open with his willingness to keep small blocks and move to not working and centralized LN.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:30:51
Your don't really know what are you talking about, block size limit should not exist. Only theymos and Core developers propaganda created situation in which block size 1MB is the correct one. Discussion lasted years, we will not solve it today.
It is obvious that off chain solution will lead to centralization and probably even with centralized hubs the routing problem will be to complicated to solve it.
Bitcoin Cash has absolutely save 0fee transactions (at least to certain amount). 
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:44:37
Brilliant devs? That is right, but show me how they will manage routing issue. It's too complicated problem to solve.
LN is solution which naturally goes to centralization. Centralized hubs is better to control.
If you want to stay with the current banking system, LN and small blocks is the perfect way to this situation.
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:37:10
Tja... This fake account is done by paid core trolls of course... Why don't you see it, poor people?
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:32:35
Nope. Bitcoin is destroyed by soft fork and LN
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:04:44
Segwit should be destroyed
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:55:40
Offensive talk is the only bullet which which Core people have in the pockets? 
If it is not all, give me more. Noobies should see that LN is bereft of real blockchain filosophy and decentralization idea and the only power which is in favor of LN and Blockstream, is propaganda and banking support. Bilderberg group needs centralized hubs in order to keep steering wheel in Bitcoin.

"I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
I tried, I failed. The another sheep is lost.
But remember, in our 8MB block (or bigger in future), there always will be enough space for you. We are not offended for this what you are saying and what you are thinking today. You will be forgiven. 
R.I.P. Core and small block.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:14:40
Yeah, yeah... When he will realize that BCH is the proper Bitcoin you will start call him the same as Roger. Shame on you false bastards.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:51:34
Excuse me Sir, I was not offending anybody, unless calling someone sheep in the herd is offensive. I didn't mean it. Actually it can be pretty, "my poor sheep, follow the others from your herd, you don't have to think, just follow the other sheep in your herd". 
Still, I encourage everyone to read the history and to know why the war has started. Connect the dots, and think, just think. 
If you connect the dots, you will see why core, blockchain and "smart" guys from this side of the fence they insisted for having 1MB block. 
I don't have to say much unless you think by yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:19:51
So, prove it, that your well known source is a bullshit. 
Open google, type in Soros, AXA, Mastercard, Bilderberg and go through some of them. Connect the dots, make your own conclusions. 
You don't have on the table facts about the real reasons of crisis 2008, federal reserve bank, nuclear program, government bribes etc. You need to dig into Internet, connect the dots and just make your own conclusions. 
About Watergate, have you ever had information or sources prior it was finally revealed by journalists?
And, the first part of your response is exactly what Core is doing. Shouting and barking around "you talk about LN but you don't understand how it works", "Satoshi's vision", "Bcash"... That's the Cornerstone of Bitcoin supporters arguments. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:29:51
You can be sure that finance system is not feeling any danger from the slow and expensive Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:26:33
Small blocks yes, but LN hubs... Doubtful...
And if you connect the dots, you will see why Bilderberg group invested in Blockchain and Core developers. For sure not for the decentralization and lack of system control.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:26:21
Never, ever use LN unless you want to have "in god we trust" or "the federal bank reserve" stamp in every transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:23:43
We are excited to see LN dying.
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:57:53
Tja... Time is in favor of Bitcoin (Cash).
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:42
How dare you quote Satoshi's at r/bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:53:39
I am eating bananas, am I a monkey?
Of course it is possible due to the solutions already integrated into code by Satoshi, at the very beginning of this project. 
Micro transactions can be done in a seconds and no fee is required, have you ever read Bitcoin White Paper? There is all what you should know+ email threads between Mark and Satoshi, they talk there exactly about it, payments with the daily transaction amount compared to Visa.
The solution like LN can be useful, and maybe some day will be, but only for the transactions less than one cent and it will require few more years to develop. LN with the functionalities which they would like to have it is complicated and there are many problems to solve.
What's more, Bitcoin Cash fits to LN the same as Bitcoin Core. Why the Core team put themselves into situation in which people were scared of dozens of $ fees and transactions time counting in hours?
Sooner or later block size will have to be increased, but from off chain solution point of view, the later, the better. With big blocks Core would not be able to find blind supporters of LN. 
Being stubborn and limiting block to 1MB is done only for one purpose, to enforce off chain solution in order to fix the scalability problem. I can say more, there is no problem itself, the problem is created by 1MB supporters because Satoshi created a variable in code to solve scalability issues. 
Just a button, you press it, when you need it, that's all. Variable prepared for such a situation.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:03:14
Poor Core people and u/theymos children. Don't see the reality... 
In North Korea they as well believe in their leader and the North Korea world order.
The only think what we can do is to pray for Bitcoin Core and Blockstream supporters to not die slowly in torments and make somehow an agony shorter.
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:38:20
I cannot? So see this... Bitcoin Core... Bitcoin Core and Segwit that is a cancer killing Satoshi's vision. Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Core... Core and Segwit should be destroyed.
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:49:40
Hahaha, yeah... After you Bitcoin somewhere, after you open channel for an astronomous sum either to one big hub or somebody else, after in some way routing issue is solved, after you ate lucky and you don't loose your funds, maybe you will pay for something ;p 
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:11:34
I can say more, he never said anything against increasing a block size.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:27:27
You are a r/Bitcoin propaganda children.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:30:45
Sure it is, since Bitcoin Cash exists the fake Bitcoin Core is no longer needed, it is obvious.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:18:52
Tja... Roger Ver, that is proper technology innovation measure. Good luck with this approach.
Kim Dzong Un is watching TV, the tv has to be a bad thing then.
Bin Laden ate oranges, let's downvote all the posts which contains word orange with it.
Do you follow? 
Technology is defending by itself, not the famous users. 
Go through the r/bitcoin uncensored. Read the first discussions regarding block size increase. Do your own research. Think by yourself, don't be a sheep.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:37:59
Heheh, trolling Roger is the only asset in your hands. When will understand that Roger is just a person, technology speaks.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:21:46
But, Buffet and others they are saying this in terms of price, and speculation was not the intention of Satoshi.
Crypto in price itself can fail, but not in terms of technology and common usage.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:51:17
Nobody is using Bitcoin Core today, that's why.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:16:13
Tja... For ten dollars fee and few hours waiting time. That's pretty much cool, you are right. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:51:39
Of course I have. But I don't think so that there is a sense if you admire that high fee and slow transaction is better than no fee and fast transaction in Bitcoin Cash. 
But, if only have a little time or willingness I would like to encourage you to read a little history talks. Bitcoin talk or r/bitcoin uncensored. You can find a lot of stuff about theymos who destroyed a possibility to say something against the small blocks. You can find a lot about the consensus of the whole community about the big blocks. The year 2015 destroyed Satoshi's vision. This vision could be restored together with BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Unlimited. Bitcoin  Cash has finally reached this. Garvin Andresen has posted recently "Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value and means of exchange".
Have you ever read the "The resolution of the Bitcoin Experiment" by Mike Hearn?
Before the 2015 the whole community was going hand in hand and there was consensus about the bigger blocks. But bigger blocks don't paid off and are not so easy to cebtralize. Small blocks force the community to think about the off chain solution in which centralized Hubs will have control about the whole network. Even Wladimir J. van der Laan clearly said that "A mounting fee pressure, resulting in a true fee market where transactions compete to get into blocks, results in urgency to develop decentralized off-chain solutions". 
But this decentralization economically will not work. Opening and closing channels will be too expensive in order to perform small payments. Additionally not always there will be enough funds frozen in the paying channels. Hence, system will force centralized Hubs which always will be online, with enough funds in the network and which will have connections with hundreds of merchants. 
Just think about it, why Bilderberg group invested so much funds ($76 million) in Blockstream? Because they just admire the Blockchain technology and Bitcoin? Give me a break... It is quite obvious that this is leading to the centralization and control of this whole system.
Just read the history and think about the facts, that is the only what I am asking for.
