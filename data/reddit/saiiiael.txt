I will sell probably below 20k, maybe around 11-18k. But more like I will try luck with short that. We will see. 
This is not imo bull market. This is fools rally, something between bear and bull market. 
Even Peter Shiff called this market that.
Just check NVT indicator and u will see that this isnt look so good. 
When we had bullrun we seen really huge spikes and market cap reached even 800 billions. Media shouts everywhere about bitcoin and youtube streamers had really huge fanbase. But now everything looks so DEAD. Bitcoin jumps only for some small amounts and looks like we dont have it institutional investors right now. 
Must say even that we need that fools rally just for better bull market in future.
Bitcoin will die faster right now imo(I mean below 20k)
but that sacrifice is needed for better arise from ashes.
This of course just my opinion and speculation.
Time will tell if right or not.

You saying that Facebook token will be stablecoin, isnt be threat to BTC and many idiots will be use them? So how exacly it will push btc? 
Because ppl start to know what cryptocurrency is?
This isnt good purpose to start investing by a new person in something with high risk of lose money dont u think?
About that suggesting. Yea, I still suggesting exacly that. In the 10 years chart this isnt looks so bad but think about that pump this days(if u even survived that), when ppl with some average job, students etc invested some life savings or money from loan just because media pumped FOMO for bitcoin. After that FOMO get in FUD and many ppl just sold lower when bitcoin starting dump hard just because they dont want to lose rest of money or all. Many also just thought that bitcoin start to dying these days.
I think now we will not reach that 20k, maybe not even 15k but after that dump what may come in future we can reach even 30k for btc or even more.
This is of course just my speculation but think about that how hard and fast btc was pumped when reached 20k and how is now. 
I really recommend you to watch chart with that NVT indicator it looks very interesting..
Oh and thank you moonboys for minuses. 
I hope we will get our moon but I just dont think it will be now :)
Maybe in 2020? Who knows.

I understand that when we hold crypto we can have profit. I assume u holding of course.
But when we reached 20k many new ppl in crypto world doesnt knew that.
We have now lack of volume to reach new highs and for higher volume we need media on our site and institutional investors with street must get in, but they still not getting in.
You may have right with that good impact of FB token. I checked and it will be come out probably in 2020 what is interesting because Bitcoin halvening will be in this year too.
We can have really good bull market in 2020 but we still have 2019y.


Thank u and I wish u best of luck aswell :)
If u are really holding I hope u trying to sell at top and buy at bottom.
(I didnt tryied it yet but this NVT indicator can be usefull in playing that this way  [ )
I been holding my investments too when was that rush to 20k, but I didnt sell at top and it was fail of mine.
We can have faith in cryptocurrencies projects and admire them, but most of us are here to make money.  If we will only hold we will lose our chances for that.

No, I am not. 
Facebook token is meaningless, Litecoin halvening too (it will not pump it very much higher btw, check previous halvening compared to chart)
BTC halvening 2020? Hm so not now..
Shiff isnt an idiot. He is smart guy, with some knowledge about economy. And I not base financial decisions because of him. 
His opinion was just example. I just gave u mine opinion about this.
Most ppl from street still didnt get up from previous bullrun to 20k, reddit dont shine like before (check how many ppl are online in bitcoin for example), youtubers aswell(check suppoman hits for example, then and now). 
To take 20k for btc or more we need more than that.
And now we even cannot take that 9100 again what its like hitting head in the wall.
If u really think this is a bull market, then maybe u are an great example that this is fools rally because of that delusional thinking.
This is just my opinion, and of course u can have right but just be carefull with that being sure of bull market right now cause Im really not.

I even smile more because of that drops :) This is very good prices and still can be much better. I waiting right now for that cause I want to buy more. Just dont invest what u not willing to lose and support projects in what u believe.
