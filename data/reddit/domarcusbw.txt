I'd like to pay from my debit card or I can link my bank account if I have to. I thought Bittrex was just for converting BTC to other AltCoins I didn't know you could buy it directly from there
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:04:05
Do you have any link to learn what futures are/means cause I'm very confused at this point. I just want to know if I should buy $200 worth of BTC during the current dip or if there will be a bigger dip cause of the futures thing
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:40:39
I just noticed I didn't cover the other part of the question. A few thousand dollars profit is honestly what I'm working towards id be so happy if I got that. From only being able to invest such little money that'd be great. And I'm trying just to forget about it from previous advice since I know long term holding it will be the best route IMO
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:53:58
But people are saying it's going to drop in value after the futures thing on Monday so wouldn't that be a better time to buy btc?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:07:13
So you don't see it going under $12,000 within the next 24-48 hours? I want to purchase $200 worth of BTC asap to convert to AltCoin cause I already have $200 USD worth of BTC right now. Should I buy now? Thanks for the good write up
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:37
So it's expected to fall tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:39
I know but I'm trying to get the general consensus since I'm planning on buying so I want to research so I have better odds
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:29:55
I know that no one knows for sure. Just looking for input. Thanks for contributing though 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:32:44
Why buy today's dip when it's expected to drop even more in the next coming days? I'm curious cause I am new to crypto and want to buy at the right time
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:30:54
You're saying when the futures open it will be a super sale? So I shouldn't buy at the dip today? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:40
Would you recommend buying $200 worth at this dip or do you think it'll get lower wi j the recent announcement of the futures opening
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:48:23
I already have $200 USD worth of BTC that I bought a few days ago. Right now I want to buy $200 more of BTC so I can exchange it to AltCoin. Would buying right now be better than waiting 12-48 hours from now when the futures openings happen?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:35:02
I've invested $500 3 different cryptos 5 days ago and have already made $100 profit just from money sitting there so I want to get more into it. For my budget for now I only can invest $200 more and I want to put it towards a couple AltCoins. That's why I'm wondering about the timing of my $200 BTC purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:08
So it's expected to fall tomorrow? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:10:37
I was about to buy $200 USD worth of BTC but with the recent news of the futures openings I'm not sure if I should buy at the current dip or the speculated dip that may happen within the next couple days
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:24:19
Would you recommend me taking advantage of the current dip and buying now or do you think the futures will cause an even bigger dip than it's at now?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:14:30
Please tell me now if this is sarcasm I really just want serious info 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:37:27
Ya if you have that much to put towards you can make a loooooooot of profit if you play your cards right. May the crypto gods be with you. Thanks for the input 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:50:13
Good thing I never follow the advice of any Reddit comment, I look at what people are saying and look into them more. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:54
It's really going to have an effect like that? What will happen to other AltCoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:50:05
What does fiat mean? I've seen it mentioned before but never knew what it was? I'm a beginner to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:57:53
Because he mentioned that as being not that big of a profit for him since he has a lot more invested and just a lot more money than me in general. Are you aware of what's happening on Monday with the futures opening?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:50:12
Fucking Christ man. I just got into the crypto game and am having success and have done a bunch of research. I really hope that was all for nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:15:48
LOL so if BTC starts to drop you think I'd blame you for it? Anything you say is just recommendation to me. Just cause you say it doesn't mean I'm going to do it or blame you for anything 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:31:07
 I thought the futures would cause the BTC to. I could be wrong and would appreciate any input
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:05:23
I've already bought $500 USD worth of crypto currency, and I'd like to buy some more so I want to take advantage of the dips so I get better profit in the end 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:05:06
You think it'll dip even lower than what it is currently?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:28:06
Would you say buying right now vs 12-24 hours from now would be beneficial? I was planning on buying $200 worth to exchange to AltCoin because I already have $200 worth of BTC. I'm not sure what you mean by ATH
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:30
I take it as speculation but I'm interested to hear other opinions since I only know one person IRL that is into cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:18
Is that sarcasm? I genuinely don't know 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:44:13
When did I say what profit I want to make? And I've invested $500 in one day spread across a few coins and can afford more but obviously I want guidance in what I should invest in
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:17:06
I understand that. Doesn't mean others input would hurt me 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:59:50
I know but I'm trying to get the general consensus since I'm planning on buying so I want to research so I have better odds
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:54
I'd analyze this but your not saying anything to support your statement. If you're this confident I'd be interested to hear your input on it
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:45:55
So as a beginner to crypto that's posting a thread for help, I should follow what I think is right? I don't know about that. I'm not looking for someone to tell me to buy now without a supporting statement
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:25
Would you recommend buying before or after Monday? I wanted to buy $200 worth BTC To exchange it for AltCoins 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:02:09
How I'm just getting into the crypto currency so I don't have the answer 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:25:11
Everyone knows about the futures stuff but me. I'm a beginner. I'm not scared of losing the money I I invest, I'm just cautious.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:29:32
I just see it as a recommendation. I don't read a single Reddit comment and make a financial decision because I don't have money like that. Any comments will help me. I just feel like buying now cause of the current dip, do you think it will go lower than 12-13k with the whole futures thing that's happening?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:26:13
Just looking for input, not facts. I know nothing someone says on here will be for certain. I'm just looking for input
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:09
But the bank account method for CoinBase  takes 4-5 days for you to receive the coins. Not the best option IMO
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:12:41
So say I buy it today, and the next day or so they rise in price, will I get all of those profits?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:09:59
I feel like that'd be worse cause you're paying each companies fee which adds up to more than a single purchase from one crypto site, right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:59
I saw an article saying the IRS wants to cut it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:03
Dude the same shit happened to me and it was my first buy ever. Such bad luck
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:05:55
But I want to buy more than $300 at once to keep the fees lower
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:31
What site would you recommend I purchase through?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:26:32
Using a bank account, right? CoinBase is giving me a $300 per week limit but I want to atleast but $400-$500 of crypto 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:48
Ya I get it but I definitely won't be on the sidelines even if I have to pay a bigger fee. I'm just trying to find the lowest one
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:36:54
Hey I sold some LTC yesterday and it says completed but I haven't received it in my bank account yet?
