If I own a piece of open-source software, just because it's open-source doesn't mean I'll accept every modification that users want to make on it. Everything must be reviewed. And even if admins don't accept it at first - if you think you've really discovered a security issue, you can easily post that on reddit and wait for shitstorm to happen. That's how transparency works.

Is there a Bitcoin forum that's more visited by the general population other than Reddit? I'm not aware. I just said Reddit since a lot of people go here and it's one of the best places to expose security issues to the public IMO.

Its like a terms and agreement, you have to read the whole thing and understand legalese if you don't trust the creator and you want "openness". Same goes with reading an algorithm - you have to know how to read code. But ball's on your court since Bitcoin code *is* open source.

You can submit a pull request and modify the line of code you disagree with/you think you can improve, push the changes and upon approval (given that it is an improvement over the previous implementation, etc), it gets integrated into the algorithm.
Or if you're not capable of making code adjustments, you can bring light to the issue you discovered, propose a solution and hopefully someone does it for you. It's like fixing real-world things - if there's a problem with your sink you can go see what the problem is, but if you don't have plumbing skills then you have to call a plumber. The advantage with open-source is that you're free to scrutinize the code however you like, and that's not possible with non-open source stuff. Proprietary software is like you can't check out what's wrong with the sink yourself.. and you can only call the brand manufacturers in order to repair it.
Good software have documentation so it won't be all gibberish to the foreign eye, and I haven't seen it yet but I imagine something as popular as Bitcoin would have an okay documentation on their code.

Can't cash out on that principal of immutability

If that happens I'll welcome it with open arms. Gotta get my hands on that sub100 Ether
