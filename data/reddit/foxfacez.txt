Ah :/ i think i can't use it then... Thank you for the suggestion anyway
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:36:38
Mhhh, do you have any proof of that? I don't want to sound rude but damn if it looks sketchy
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:50:35
What do you mean with proof of address?
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:13:32
So, mmmh idk because my father wants me to do a bank account, then i would be able to actually sell with coinbase... is there a reason to go with btc-e instead?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:30:45
Whhat kind of informations they require?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:17:34


@_date: 2015-03-09 18:11:50


They can't see the payment (even tho i think this is just bullshit) and they can't accept it because it didn't come from my bank account so yeah idk
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:56:47
Bitonic seems fair, what kind of information thhhey require?
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:04:08
Thank you for the detailed response, i will probably go with coinbase...
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:41:55
That sucks, well this one  ask for 3% too but it's just too much for 2.3 bitcoins
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:29:14
ATM it's the cheapest if they use credit cards, but they take a fee of like 3% :/
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:49:25
Yeah i posted it and i was like, wait lemme see if they accept credi cards and nope.. ahah
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:36:58
What do you mean with locally?
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:48:57
can't use bank transfer sadly :/
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:19:51
I saw 24-7 exchange but i would lose like 40 dollars with them so i don't think i can do that, i can just open a checking account and fuck it then... :/ too bad there's not really a nice way to do it, someone should do something like that imho..
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:55:18
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:48:30
really i don't know yet, but i'm pretty scared of the fluctating price :/
@_date: 2015-02-26 12:02:36
so there's no way i can sell them with just a credit card?
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:42:42
i saw them both before but i would prefer to sell them to like a site rather than selling them to some people
