The fact that developers behind Bitcoin can't come to a consensus that implements a fix for the current dilemma, without requiring tedious configs on the users end, is concerning. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:59:55
Well, let's just say you won't be ordering any tacos once you spend all your money on fees, and sit there over night waiting for confirmations. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:37:53
Your going to be posting this a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:40
Last I checked, merchants and services were rapidly dropping BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:00:50
Still, there's no way in hell I'm going to buy $20 in gas, and pay $5 in fees. When I got my Bitpay card, it was more like a $0.01-$0.25 fee for just about any transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:37:32
Yes I would still use Crypto. Because sometimes spreading the tools that enable the world to be more parallel with your ideals, is more valuable than making a quick buck, and being secretive. If anything, I could just buy more BTC to load back on my card with fiat and eat the fees (given they are minimal). 
Remember Bitcoin is "Decentralized", So it is the users responsibility to spread information to push adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:10:14
I'm saying that using a Bitpay card is one of the most powerful tools for putting Cryptocurrencies in front of retailers.
I'm saying *I would use my bitpay card for gas*, not the whole world. 
I enjoy spreading the word, But i can't if the word is bad. 
I'm sure this was a trend among advocates. So the current situation is effectively stunting the growth of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:39:44
I enjoyed using my bitpay card at local stores to help spread information about BTC. But I haven't been able to do so at all this year due to the fees for Bitcoin rendering it dysfunctional. 
But hey, Once bitpay adds support for Bitcoin-Cash in 2018 (Like they stated), the spark will be back, and i'll be out using my Bitpay card for gas and smokes again. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:29:04
That's what happens when major payment processing services start moving away from Bitcoin. Bitpay isn't processing any transaction under $100 because of the BS. Many other services are also halting BTC affiliation due to fees.
So yea, Mempool will clear up as less and less people are using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:37:28
"We have to solve this"
apparently you have not been in cryptos the last 4 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:41:18
So we compare Decentralized Currency Dynamics to a centralized roadway network? 
Interesting. I guess Bitcoin-Cash would be like the Autobahn in Germany then. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:06:53
*some people* are already implementing the needed upgrades. 
*Cough cough*
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:17:25
Yup, I missed it lol. I apologies for that. 
I am glad they are somewhat operational again. But still, I want it to be *convenient*, so I can have it come off as a efficient upgrade to retailer's payment systems. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:45:42
What about the dynamic, that, BTC is unfeasible for common people? 
If you transact less than $100, your going to pay ~50% in Transaction fees. 
If a retailer uses Square* to prcoess payments, it'd be cheaper, and would be a step backward.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:59:42

For real, I remember using faucets that paid directly to your wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:14:22
That still doesn't explain why it was usher'd into the main-net. 
This is why the test-net exists. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:56:42
It amazes me how people can disagree, yet they are incapable of providing an informative angle on why they disagree. So I do appreciate you explaining things straight forward. 
And I guess that would be possible, but most likely a bit complicated for poverty-stricken people to grasp the concept, and properly use a multi-layered utility. I'm sure that initial fee, will deter a lot. They will see the first fee and assume that is what it will be every time. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:25:06
You do realize Bitcoin is 9 years old?
And you do realize the LN devs advertised that LN+Segwit would lower TX fees to a reasonable amount ?
How another 2 year wait seems acceptable at all, blows my mind. 
There are blockchains running right now, on base-layer protocols that can facilitate high volumes all awhile retaining a minimal TX fee. In 2 years, those said chains will have built upon that, and effectively be 2 years ahead of BTC.

@_date: 2018-03-13 14:28:27
Maybe if upgrade solutions were done in a more simplistic fashion,
All of the services currently utilizing the chain could upgrade without the potential of fucking shit up. 
Code should be easy for platforms to integrate. Once you start complicating it, you are complicating it's adoption. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:09:45
All I have to say to that is.... If it took 5 years for a flawed 2ed layer to be developed and pushed to the main-net, We will all be dead by the time that automation between BTC and its "Layers" becomes seamless. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:07:14
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:16:31
Email is not that complicated. Do yourself a favor and go google "How E-mail Works". There isn't much too it really. Using E-mail as the analogy doesn't really work given it does not have complicated layering. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:10:32
So why wouldn't the developers and testers keep it on the test-net until it's polished? It's putting uninformed users at risk. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:36:38
There is no way it can become a global currency, If it has fees that cost as much as some poverty stricken area's citizens make in a day. 
*Edit. Ok fella who down-voted this comment, Please explain why an individual making $1 a day would spend $0.50 on a single transaction? 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:01:31
No see that's the thing. Being open-source, anything is possible. So one would be foolish to dedicate to any specific chain. 
I'm just saying, at this point in time, the current development rate for efficient protocols is not parallel with adoption, and it is troubling the community. 
I'm here for two things. 
-Individual financial empowerment void of government influences. 
-Commerce efficiency 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:16:47
More like a triathlon, But BTC forgot how to swim. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:42:43
That's a gross perspective.
CEOs and politicans are making a larger proptertion of revenue than their employees compared to then. As industries grow, it opens doors for new wealth, and competition drives these things to a reasonable value. We as humans adopted these complexities to our lives because the markets allowed us too. 
The issue isn't that, we need to go live in a sod house, it's that greed has manifested itself acorss all industires, and that has a trickle down effect to the avergae Joe. 
Tell me how the fuck you'r going to get a property, or get licenses and permits, or a reliable income without a car, and a computer. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:06:37
They have issues. And a main-net release should be final product. That is why there is a Test-Net
People are burning coins by sending Legacy address coins to Segwit addresses. 
And LN has vulnerabilities. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:14:27
I never said LN+Segwit were the same devs. I said how the devs of both said that they would drastically lower TX fees. 
And fees of 1/sat/byte get cleared IF, and ONLY IF, you have a Segwit compatible wallet, and are using the LN.
And sure, no blockchain can prove scalability to meet the worlds needs, but there are one's doing a hell of a lot better job than BTC.
I disregarded your "Everything Else", because they were made under an assumption. 
A quick check of the mempool states that in fact, 1 sat/byte TXs rarely make it to the next block, and this is only valid while volume is so low. Once the market picks back up, as will volume, and TX fees will follow. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:53:16
I like how they can trust 0- confirmation transactions. 
I mean they show up in your wallet right away too.

I seem to be having difficulties ordering from your website.
I placed an order, and sent a payment, but It did not confirm.  Please check your private messages.

After 90 days, you begin to accumulate a Dormancy Fee, $5.00 per month 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:24:16
This TXID I made for example, has been unconfirmed for DAYS !
At any point I can re-index, and rescan my wallet, and resubmit the transaction to someone else. 
If i did that, the original receiver would not receive their BTC.
So if I had purchased anything with that transaction, I can effectively scam the seller if they do not wait for 1 confirmation AT LEAST. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:14:51
Quit your shilling. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:11:03
I haven't used the card in probably that long. Which is why I am frustrated they are prolonging the process for me. 
Which is why I am trying to cancel it. But Bitpay won't help me
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:06:48
That's ludicrous. 
Wasn't LN supposed to resolve that from the go? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:20:08
I never received a request ID when I contacted Bitpay via phone. 
I have a request ID from when I first attempted to contact with Email that has not been responded to.  
Which would you like? 
If I just continue to not use it, will they just de-activate it one it racks up enough debt from inactivity fees?  
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:33:45
It's funny, because I did call the customer support line to cancel my card some weeks ago.
They rep told me he was going to cancel it / send out a form. 
My card and account are still active, and I never received ANY type of form or request. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:48:04
I even called the line they set up to cancel / reorder card. 
The rep told me he would get a form to cancel my card.
This was weeks ago. 
Bitpay has some very bad customer service.
No progress in my case, No communication regarding why. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:01:17
Ok thank you James. 
I appreciate you telling me all these details.
According to what you've said, and what I've read on the website, If I just continue to not use my card for a long time, you guys will most likely just deactivate it. And this will be of no negative impact to me once so ever. 
I'll just do that. I already spent too much time trying to deactivate it. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:03:40

I do recall reading an article on how there is a team working on a solution to reduce the blockchain size. 
It won't be an issue. 
Also, Satoshi talked about pruning, as can be read in old Bitcointalk posts,  and reducing chain size, so why is this bad ?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:18:46
here is a representation of what Satoshi saw to be a solution for reclaiming disk space. Or "Pruning".
 ^ That is from Satoshi's whitepaper
How is this fraud?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:55:10
Use = / Spam
Something lost here. 
If i made a commercial platform on BTC that ran 1sat/byte micro-transactions all day, it would be seen as spam, and not utility. 
lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:54:39
Also, Smart Contracts and 32mb blocks on BCH in a few weeks. 
HUGE upgrade. all ON CHAIN. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:05:10
It's definitely not centralized. Dig around, Hash power AND nodes are spreading more and more every day. 
BCH is upgrading to avoid the invisible ceiling, keep pace with Moore's law,  and to avoid accelerating TX fees. Having more capacity for liquidity invites more big businesses to adopt a use-case on the chain. 
Furthermore, BCH solved a problem the BTC chain was suffering using innovation. go check out memo.cash , its a great concept of on-chain actions, using micro-transactions. Something you used to be able to do on the BTC chain, (but not anymore)
It is impossible to spam the BCH to render it ineffecient. the 32mb blocks can process A LOT of transactions. about 32x more than 1mb blocks actually. 
A quick check of your profile reflects you are only worried about "Hodling" and the Value. You greed reinforces your hostile position here. 
Also, a lot of people use the BCH chain. go check out Yours.org, Memo.cash, and Joystream. These are platform working ON BCH CHAIN, and have lots of users.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:43:26
If a chain is prone to spam, it is a vulnerability in the network and should be addressed. 
But, Segwit and LN was SUPPOSED to fix this. 
Here we are again, BTC transaction fees are about to get really high again.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:33:53
A full years worth of 32mb blocks comes to be 1,118 GB.
(96 blocks in a day * 364 days = 34944 blocks. So 52416 blocks * 32mb = 1118208 mb ) (Used 15 min block times)
But remember, not every block will be 32mb, only the ones that get enough transactions to create a 32mb block. 
a Terabyte HDD is under $75. 
I have no problem buying a 2TB HDD to run a node for the next year. 
And once an efficient pruning method is introduced, it won't allocate old transactions in-depth, to your node. Reducing the chain size locally. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:00:37
Lol. How foolish. 
Doubling the blocksize is a very efficient scaling method. 
I dare you to go stress-test BCH. Let me know how poor you get. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:40:29
A hardfork that integrated segwit for everybody would do just that.
Unfortunately, that will never happen, and another moment of network congestion is inevitable. 
It's ok, we have BCH. it scales so well, they made a social platform built ON-CHAIN !
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:20:21
A node would run just fine on a average home network, using a modern computer.
But yea, it wont run on a Rasp PI. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:12:19
Most people in modern countries today have access to unlimited bandwidth of 15mBs down. 
also, the blocks are 32mB not 32 GB. 
If you stream HD videos, you probably use more than 32mB in 15 minutes.
This isn't really an issue. And i'm sure more privacy practices can be taken. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:17:22
Exactly. 
And you don't have to prune a node if you don't need to.
And you can always check the in-depth transactions between A and D on a explorer if you are running pruned. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:45:09
seems accurate.
I ran the numbers with 15 minutes block times.  But any formula with 10-15 minute blocks should give you an accurate idea. 
All n all, A 2 TB HDD is cheap. So just about anyone with a modern computer can run a node indefinitely. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:23:42
When it comes to comparing bandwidth, yes it can be compared to HD video streaming. (Because it's something most people do that uses a lot more bandwidth than downloading a block-chain)
And the speed you are able to sync the chain depends on your peers, bandwidth, and hardware. 
If you torrent the full blockchain from a source with a lot of seeds, you can surely download the entire chain in a few hours. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:45:52
I think it's great testing grounds for protocol development.
Sure it has no immediate benefit that is dramatic, but the concept has potential.

U scurred ?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:09:55
BCH isn't even controlled by him. Ver was a key catalyst for the fork, but most of the developments, and influencing entities, are completely separate from ver. He is aggressive with marketing, sure, and he's a bit loud about his ideals, sure, but he is not pulling all the strings behind BCH, and one would be foolish to assume so.

@_date: 2018-04-25 12:53:32
Funny I didn't mention anything about BCH. Yet, me talking about BTC becoming inadequate offended you, and you instantly fired off a "Bcash-sucker".
FYI. I was Pro-BTC before you knew cryptos existed. I watched the main dev "team" fall apart, and argue for years, and spawn hundreds of alts. 
At the end of it, I am no longer Pro-BTC, but Pro-efficiency, and freedom. And I will support whatever chain provides the most of those. Should BCH become tainted, I have no problem jumping ship. I refuse to hold on to a failed project, and attack others enlightening inputs, as you so desperately are.

I'm kind of disappointed you don't have the mats. I use mats over containers any day. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:20:19
From my perspective, mats give you the ability to waist very little, to no, oil. As you can bend it over itself to collect stray dabs. If you could find a way to combine the mats with a case with similar dimensions to a Nintendo DS game case, or playstation/xbox game case, I am willing to bet people would begin to ditch the mini "Jar" like container. Not only do mats offer plenty of room to work with your oil, but they are also fairly easy to place "Fresh" oil on, from other utensils such as razor blades, without damaging the silicone. 
the "Containers" gradually collect oil in the hard to remove areas, such as the lid, and offer little to no room for multiple oils without mixing. They are also easily cut/punctured when poking utensils on the sides/bottom.
Good luck with your business, I look forward to seeing more of your future products !
