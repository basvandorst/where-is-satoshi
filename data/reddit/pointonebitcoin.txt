Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:46:19
Bitcoin is worth at least 6 figures. It will correct itself all the way up to that point. Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:41
Pound that dip in my ass RIGHT NOW.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:36
I know, but that didn't stop it from dropping $3000 in literally seconds. I guess in a way the crashing is a safety net, but it definitely fucked up that amazing run we had. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:18:54
I'm not upset because I'm fucking rich and in a year I will be 10 times richer. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:48:09
Server crashes are ruining this wave. Time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:51:28
Just shut up and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:48:08
Here comes the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:24
Make Bitcoin Great Again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:49:50
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:00:17
I can't wait to buy at 5k tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:21:10
Do you mean the price will go way up or down?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:02
Is it 7 figures yet? If not, then yes, buy now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:31:44
Everyone is going to sell before the next few days of uncertainty 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:53:08
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:06
Yes, the limit is server crashes. As soon as coinbase gets its shit together it is going 20+. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:19:28
My mental health has been destroyed. I can't do this any more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:58:07
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:12:07
Yeah but momentum, man. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:29:50
It will be 6 figures in 2018 so no. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:16:44
Why can't it be like that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:41:12
HODL SEASON BOYS
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:02:50
Everyone is watching for price dips now and many have been since the big 10k news. Bitcoin is unstoppable. It is like LeBron James on the fast break.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:45:19
20k within a week. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:06:10
No you do not need a house. You can buy a tent at fucking Walmart and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:44:54
It literally can't be worthless with a limited quantity and high public interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:04:00
But that $100 is growing so I'm super fucking happy
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:52:50
Huge dip will be picked up by media tomorrow and it will result in mass panic and suicides 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:38:01
Every dip gets bought up, every single time. It doesn't matter how big the dip is. This is why bitcoin isn't risky like so many say it is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:35:55
No, and even if that were to happen it would require the general public to become very well educated on cryptos. Possible but unlikely. If it happens, it will be easy to see coming. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:01:06
I kept $100
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:03:41
He doesn't say why he couldn't even keep 5%. Get a cheaper house and hodl ffs. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:43:03
I'd be shocked if it doesn't hit 20k in December. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:20:43
18k in the next hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:25
We can start talking about too late when it is 6 figures
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:41:48
Because it is the gold standard and only 17 million non lost bitcoins can exist. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:20:03
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:24:59
should I panic sell?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:23:32
The past several days I don't think I've spent more than 5 seconds thinking about anything else. Hodl is my life. I'm rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:30:09
Oh man this upcoming spike is going to be JUICY. I'm feeling $2,000. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:12:25
Im in the USA and I have a $500 deposit that has been pending for 4 days. Is this normal?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:23
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:53
Imagine the price when coinbase goes back up and everybody sees the dip. 20k here we come. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:27:47
I know for a fact that won't happen. The absolute lowest bitcoin could possible fail at is 40-50k, but it will likely end at a 6 or 7 figure number. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:50:34
People can see the massive potential over 2-3 years and don't want to get in too late. Looks like 20k can happen any day now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:41:24
Correct, but bitcoin isn't even 10% of the way to where it will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:51:10
Biggest crash in bitcoin history tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:19:13
A shitcoin that will be worth $1,000,000 2 years from now, yeah. Absotutely. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:46:56
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:18
Big spike coming. Hodl to 1 million. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:43
Do you believe now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:44:04
15k in the next hour maybe. 20k this week maybe, definitely this month. Hodl to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:16
20k in the next week
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:55:54
Nothing significant until it is 7 figures
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:54:26
Just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:42:54
I'm sorry, but everyone that doesn't believe in bitcoin is an absolute idiot. This is nowhere near the finish line. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:17:49
What a dumbass for not knowing it passed 10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:21:26
The amount of small investors watching bitcoin closely has exploded since 10k. So many people ready to buy. 20k this week. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:44:43
There is still so much growing to do. The general public still doesn't know shit about bitcoin. We have a loooooong way to go until people stop buying big on the dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:03
Servers crashed and the price crashed $3k. You can't buy or sell anything on coinbase right now. As soon as you can buy on coinbase, it will jump again.
TIME TO BUY AND HODL! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:19
Well coinbase allowed buying again but it was very slow and the price was unbelievably slow to reload, keeping people from pulling the trigger. 
Oh well. Only up from here. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:52:07
Buy the dips and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:40:31
Yeah, at a certain point when it is way way way way way more than it is now it will take a nice crash. Not even worth talking about right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:47:09
Ballsy idea but it would pay off.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:47
1 million. Then 10 million is where bitcoin will die. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:12:50
The money shows up as spend on my card but I can't put it back. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:40
Just bought another $100
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:00
No, you buy asap because the shit keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:09:21
If you knew it would be 7 figures some day, what would you do? Well thats whats going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:39
No. People are big on buying dips and there are only 17 million bitcoins out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:57
Every dip gets bought up. Bitcoin is unstoppable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:13:22
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:07
I have wisdom. And a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:49:57
Because everyone has heard of bitcoin. Even several years ago people had heard of it. It will turn to currency once people stop selling it for USD and exchange it with each other for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:53
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:16:47
Now is the time to buy. A big dip single handedly caused by crashing servers, not authentic panic. If you've been waiting for a dip and don't capitalize on this one then you're an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:31:18
Bitcoin to the fucking moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:24
Lol if it ever got near 10k again everyone and their grandma would buy that shit till it gets sent to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:44:03
Not the people I was talking about. 
It will hit 6 figures in 2018. People missing out on this are crazy. It is right in front of all of our faces. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:52:33
Enjoy the pussy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:54:42
You'll regret that when bitcoin hits 6 figures in 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:18:28
Is it under 6 figures? If yes, then yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:16:10
Good. 6 figures here we come baby. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:44:32
This is accurate. The dip was timed perfectly for the rest of the world waking up in the morning saying it is time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:15:18
I just puked. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:59:14
Sell shit and make it happen pussy. HODL to the fucking moon. 100k next year baby. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:53:32
Nice minor dips that will get blown to the moon. 20k in the next week.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:17:12
Im worried it will never go back and the money will be lost. I have 2 pending transactions and it is like lost money right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:08
HODL AND BUY BUY BUY IF YOU ARENT STUPID
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:59
How could you not even keep some? You sold ALL? Just dumb. It will hit 1 million someday.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:26:36
I was trying to get people to buy so it would stop tanking. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:49
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:09:23
I know I do. I also have a throw my daily life away and watch the GDAX charts for hours problem. At least now that I sold I can have a somewhat normal and productive day tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:49
"Bitcoin purchases are temporarily disabled" on coinbase. 
It is going to EXPLODE when this is fixed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:21
That will be called a dip and it will be bought up until that shit is sent to the moon. Way to many moms and dads are looking at buying low right now but are frustrated that it won't go low. Especially with Christmas coming up. An actual crash is impossible, but big explosions are very possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:37
That is illegal right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:46
Wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:47:07
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:34:52
This guy gets it. 
No way it will be this predictable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:30
Fuck off and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:29
Sold too early?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:19:50
I just bought lite coin for the first time and it went down $15 in minutes. 
Fuck me. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:18:56
I am mentally ill. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:46:52
This shit is going to take a huge dip. Sentiment around here is shit and with exchange crashes and futures it will be a bad couple of days. I'll buy some after big dips but for the sake of my mental health I'm never going balls deep ever again. This has damn near tore apart my family.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:26
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:01
Those are going to make the price explode again all at once won't they?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:34:06
This is a dip that will get bought up. You will be in the green by tomorrow. Relax. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:18:00
Maybe you should have gone to class in high school.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:01:57
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:22:34
Everybody is shitting their pants over the servers crashing which only means that bitcoin will have an even bigger explosion sometime later today. Buy the dips and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:58
And what would you have said to 15k several days ago? I predicted it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:52
Just absolutely fucking insane. This is only the beginning. 
TO THE MOON!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:07:35
Fucking pound it! Harder!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:21
I can feel a jump of thousands of dollars right now....
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:24
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:59:46
Wrong. 6 figures in 2018. 1 million in 2020.
