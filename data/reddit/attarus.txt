People are moving them to cold storage in the hopes that one day it will be more, taking it out of exchanges, making the value go down. That's how "banks" get their money, by how much people have stored and entrusted with them. Investors don't want to invest in something that has no money of its own.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:18:26
so why would they pay that again?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:06:17
Better to do that now then 20 years down the road when it's widely adopted

If you don't make more than I think $3,000 you don't have to pay taxes on it
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:17:54
I thought me paying the fees and the exchange I sell it through paying their taxes, covered me not having to pay taxes on it. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:26:15
So if I pay $2,000 in taxes with BTC today, is the IRS going to come after me at the end of the year when it is worth nothing?
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:34:47
I get what you are say and that was the core point. That it is used as a currency exchange for whatever value it holds at that time. So buying a $8 pizza then for 10,000 BTC or now for 0.0018, it's still $8. Holding on to it is no different then hanging onto an older currency for a collector to later acquire from you for an elevated price or just putting it in a 410k or something. Only thing is 410ks penalize you for taking it out early.

@_date: 2018-11-20 19:03:18
I don't see how anyone could day trade with it taking as long as it does sometimes to transfer. You'd have to have a lot of money to play around with.

If people aren't using what has already been mined to the full potential, what incentives is there for miners? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:28:41
The cost of buying the equipment, electricity to power it and then the time it takes to get a solid block VS the value of a completed block. If 1.0 BTC is at $5k (on a good day) but you have to spend $3,000 on parts then one and half years mining it with a $200/m electric bill...you're now in the hole $1,600.

Especially when people are like "haha dude you must feel so stupid, that 10,000 BTC would be enough to retire on now, that pizza place never has to work another day" but then that pizza place just turned around and exchanged it for their local currency and paid their bills. Essentially all we have discovered is an elaborate way to shift money around, for whatever reason...thinking it's Linden dollars or something

ah fascinating, thanks for giving a real answer

So do they pull and average price from different exchanges of what it is selling for, or does the algorithm some how display what it is trading for on its own?

The U.S. dollar is no longer based on the Gold standard. It's based on oil, something we have no idea how much exist and are burning through as quick as we are pulling it from the earth. Maybe right now the market cap looks weak by comparison, but we know exactly how many will exist and once they are all mined and inflation kicks in...
Besides majority of the "power" the U.S. dollar has over the world is locked up in spiderweb infested bank vaults by rich assholes that won't be able to take it with them when they die and just leave it to their lawyers. Instead of giving every household in the world free solar panels because they got their money from oil and that would be "bad for business".

yea revolutions take time, its a snowball effect and we rolled ourselves into a diamond from all the pressure. 1 digital Bitcoin worth $3,000 USD Petro Dollars (at its worst) was a hell of a feat, I can't think of a single country that has as high of a exchange rate. The USA's dollar has dominated the market for decades, not anymore.

If Bitcoin could rise to even the top 5th currency power of the world, having several countries officially adopt it as their national standard. Then a new era would unfold upon humanity where the hard working, middle and lower class people, will have a chance to reshape things for the better. Alleviating poverty, starvation, bad health, conflicts, over population and even climate change. Everyday people have seen this side of the world first hand and posses the knowledge of how to truly solve them. Unfortunately the problem with the way things are now is that so many resources (money) are tied up by a 1% that is unsure what the world really needs.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:42:02

I think they are great, its a good way to be able to make regular transactions without having to go through the network and in person. You just have to trust the person you are dealing with of course but it has everything you need to  uploaded it to your own wallet. Then if you have to you can use services like the Mycelium app. I've transferred upwards of $10,000 on it no problem or worry.

I bought 1.0 BTC when it was at $275, then it went to $1,000 and I was like neat, sold $250 of it and just kept the profits in there. Then it went to $20,000. I don't remember the math but when I sold it I got like $12k back. Then I just bought $100 at $7,500 and $100 when it was at $3k.

In an op-ed on Yahoo! Finance, Alex Gurevich, a professor of Mathematics and an ex-JPMorgan executive, believes Bitcoin is edging closer to becoming digital gold “with every single day it doesn’t die.”
“Despite the rise and fall of various altcoins and fork considerations, “time” works FOR Bitcoin, not AGAINST it. Every day it doesn’t disappear, it gets one step closer to a permanent status of digital gold,” he went on to state in the op-ed. Taking his readers down memory lane on why there was demand for gold and precious metals, Gurevich stated that precious metals had always been used as a means of exchange for centuries, as they “do not oxidize easily and remain in an uncorrupted form” (hence, retain their value over time).
However, amongst all precious metals, gold is neither the most common nor the rarest. He opined that over the centuries, the middle ground that gold held ended up working to its advantage; it is common enough to be a currency that can be used all over the world, but also not so common that mining can easily disrupt its price.
With these advantages, gold has been able to outlive its competitors, and as such, it ended up gaining worldwide credibility about
Gurevich believed that while Ether is battling to be digital copper, Bitcoin is well on its way to becoming digital gold. This will mean that while the value of Ether will be driven but the demand for tech, that of Bitcoin will be driven by the sole need for it to be a store of liquidity value
On why Bitcoin is specifically the frontrunner in the race to gaining this title, he explained that the advantage of incumbency has favored the currency, and that just like gold did to other precious metals (which might or might not have had better aesthetic advantages, ubiquity, and rarity than it did), Bitcoin is in the process of outlasting its competition.

That's fine by me, I'm not expecting any hand outs, the only silver spoon I ever had I had to steal. I'm happy your daddy was able to pay for you to go to college for something useless. How much oil do we have? What happens when that runs out? What happens to the earth when you frack it over? oh that's right, greater landslides, sinkholes and earth quakes. Sand is not a substitute for oil, no more than bullets are for blood. I'm from Houston, Texas and proud of it, oil "drilling" can be a good thing in moderation. Bitcoin is beyond Satoshi, he was just the middle man of something greater, he did not invent Bitcoin but discovered it. You are at least right that in another decade it will be something useful.
