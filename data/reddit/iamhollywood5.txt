Honestly, at this point, anyone who's still holding onto even the smallest inkling of hope that they'll ever see a single penny of their stolen money returned to them is simply delusional.  Anybody who has or is trying to submit claims is only wasting their time.  Even these Goxdox are pointless, as if it wasn't already completely obvious that Karpeles is one of the most brilliant scammers in history and he will live the rest of his life in peace with all of the many millions he stole.
I just wish there was a serious bounty on him, and someone who was willing to take up that bounty, fly to Japan, hunt him down, and brutally murder him.

If the reason for not being able to access the cold storage wallets is FBI seizure, I highly doubt he'd file for bankruptcy.  It's unlikely the FBI would let it get that far.  I wish this were the case, but the cold truth is just that the coins are gone and aren't ever coming back and Mr Karpeles will have a miserable remainder of his life with his personal 200K BTC gone, his highly-profitable exchange gone, lawsuits left and right, jail time, and being one of the most hated people on the planet.

@_date: 2014-03-04 17:19:24
The problem is that there's no way of knowing, so you have to assume the worst.  The main point is that some mysterious hackers broke into MtGox files and whether or not they copied down the info or not, the info has been compromised and at least seen by people outside of MtGox, which should make you nervous enough.  It doesn't matter if they say they supposedly have "good intentions," because even good people can be corrupted by copious amounts of money, and these hackers are likely being offered ridiculous amounts of money on the black market for the ID info they stole.
I would start taking precautionary actions immediately.  The sooner you get on it, the less potential damage you risk.

I'm pretty sure that just because the court has ordered liquidation doesn't mean MtGox and its assets still can't be bought by another company.  I think the liquidation ruling just means that MtGox can't rehab itself.  Selling everything (the BTC, the code, the servers, the brand and rights, and any other assets) to a company like OKCoin just has to be approved by the court, and then it's in the hands of the new owners.  Rehab and Acquisition are two different things. There's really been 3 options the whole time - 1) Self Rehabilitation, 2) External Acquisition, and 3) Liquidation.  I believe only option 1 is ruled out so far...

I kinda think it's legit too.  If it is, it sounds like people will be repaid, but it's unclear whether they will try to repay BTC holders with $160 per BTC, or actually repay them in BTC.  At the very least I might get $450 back out of my $700 initial investment... (since they have 3.3 of my BTC and the closing value was $135)

Well Satoshi had 1 million BTC and he fell off the face of the earth.  Karpeles ate 750K BTC, and there's sure to be at least 250K more BTC that people have just forgotten about or accidentally lost/destroyed.  So I'm guessing 2 million BTC are gone forever.

Misleading title.  He hasn't just "fallen off the grid" as if nobody knows where he is.  He just wont come to America, he's still in Japan and wants deposition in Taiwan instead.

Whether he's trying to make everything right or just run off with the money, coming to America would be a bad idea for him.

it will be satisfying to see Karpeles spend his life in prison and have every dollar he has taken away from him and split up among the gox depositors (which still wont be much), but what good does suing MtGox do when the exchange HAS NO MONEY TO SUE FOR?

Well apparently MtGox also owns Bitcoin[b]s[/b].com, I got my hopes up thinking blockchain.info actually bought it from MtGox in the liquidation process.  In fact I'm surprised Blockchain.info didn't do the noble thing and buy bitcoins.com instead bitcoin.com, because all the money they spent on it would have been split up among the MtGox customers.

No.  MTGOX HAS NO COINS.  It doesn't matter if the coins are still in their wallets - they lost the private keys, which means the coins no longer exist.  All of them.
I had all of my coins there.  All of them.  it's tough moving on but I have to realize I'm not the only person in the world that's ever lost almost everything.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:14:08
I would, but only after waiting at least a year to see how new management handles it and they would have to offer TONS of proof that they are running it responsibly and actually have the funds to be 100% solvent.
But we better hope people would still use them, because maintaining income from high transaction volume is the only way they could really work off the debt and pay us all back.
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:53:24
Umm, you consider 1% + $0.15 to be huge? If you live in the US, then coinbase is probably the cheapest way to buy in or cash out. 1% is huge for day-trading, but if you're trying to day-trade on coinbase, you're doing it wrong. Make your initial deposit on coinbase, take your BTC to a real exchange like BTC-e and trade at 0.2%
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:13:02

@_date: 2014-03-03 19:34:29
Most likely no.  I know the problem was with Gox and not BTC, but I'm just too badly burned by it to even think about investing in BTC again.  Plus I just don't have any money left to invest now.  I'll still use it for sending or receiving payments, but I'm never going to hold it again.

Doesn't make much sense to me.  If news drops that indicates Gox users WILL get at least some of their money back eventually, people might wanna buy discount BTC if they are willing to wait a long time to get it.
I bought GoxBTC @ 0.37, and I was really hoping that after the civil rehab got going the rate would shoot back up and I could sell at 0.4 and get my real BTC back.  I guess I'm stuck waiting to see what BB can claim in lawsuits...
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:52:39
the 5M he used to have.  He's just joking around.  At one point he had 5 million on Gox and then he used BitcoinBuilder to salvage what he could and ended up with only 1 million.  1 million is still a lot of money, but that's gotta suck for him to think about what he could have had if he didn't put his money on Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:18:31
I guess you make a good point about money laundering, but I've traded on BTC-e for a long time and feel pretty safe.  They just recently made a statement about making their own steps to prove their reserves, and people who run the exchange are always talking with traders in the chatbox.  I've never had any problem getting money in or out of that exchange, but I don't keep my money there when I'm not actively trading (and you shouldn't store your money on any exchange either, obviously).  I kind of like the way that they are so anonymous, as weird as that sounds...

What he did was really cool, but really the only people truly benefitted were those who had USD in MtGox to buy GoxCoins, sell them on his exchange, and then end up with more than twice the USD they started out with.
Those with trapped BTC still lost over half their money, but hey at least he helped them get that much out.
He gave the rest of us a chance to gamble, and I can't blame him for my loss (I traded all my realBTC to GoxCoins betting that they'd actually re-enable withdrawals, I knew what I was getting into)
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:54:50
"most likely"?
seriously dude?  You actually thought this was real?
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:27:28
I'm guessing at least that much eventually.  Hell I'll take that, I took the risk of trading all my 1.25 BTC for 3.31 Goxcoins at a rate of 0.37, getting 0.89 BTC back wouldn't be all that bad a result for a foolish risk that turned out bad.
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:49:45
Just because an exchange proves solvency doesn't mean it's ever a good idea to STORE your funds there when not actively trading... but anyways good to hear
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:38:34
yes, they did exist.  And yes, they still do exist.  They were either stolen, or the private keys to them have been lost.  In both cases, the bitcoins are permanently gone.
@_date: 2014-04-20 05:19:33
Bitcoin, in its current state, is very unattractive to the risk-averse people of this world.  Part of the explanation of the lack of females using bitcoin is the techie/geeky side of it, but the other part is that females are notoriously more risk-averse than males, on average, especially when it comes to money.  So bitcoin is like 95% male if not more.
I've always been the type of person that's attracted to risk.  Sometimes it pays off nicely, other times it kicks me in the nuts.  Like when I lost $700 of BTC by betting that MtGox was solvent (spending all my BTC on GoxCoins at a 3.31 exchange rate) which is a significant sum to me as I'm a college kid just struggling to get by.  But if the risk worked out and MtGox didn't collapse, I would have walked away with $2500-3000 in BTC and I would have been called a genius.
Point is, most people are not as attracted to risk as I am, and therefore aren't nearly as comfortable with bitcoin as I am.  When I see risk, I see huge profits.  When my father sees risk, all he sees is huge losses.  We're all wired differently.  Risk-averse people will look at us early adopters and probably be a little bit jealous that our bets paid off, but they wont regret avoiding risk because there was always a chance it would fail and even the big profits still weren't worth the risk for them.
I feel like I'm probably only making sense to myself, but eventually bitcoin will be less risky and late adopters (adopting as a currency or payment method, not a profit-taking scheme) will feel fine about avoiding the risky stage of bitcoin.
