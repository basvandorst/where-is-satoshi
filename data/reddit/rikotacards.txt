Actually, would anyone mind explaining how to read the green downward slope, and the red upward slope? 
I tried youtubing some explanation on this, but I still don't really understand how anyone can look at this chart and predict anything.

It has to do with uploading my passport, then taking a photo of my face. I keep getting the email "Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your identity. Please try submitting your identity documentation again." - Quite frustrating! grr..

Hi guys, I've also recently gotten into this crypto currency trading. I'm a US citizen based in Singapore. I'd like to try and use an exchange that would be friendly to someone based in Singapore with a Singapore bank account. Any recommendations ? 
I've checked a few others, however they won't cater to US citizens.
Thanks a lot!

Just like 3 or 4 days ago. And I got an email today saying my account is verified for tier 2.

Thanks for the reply! 
You know I signed up with Xfers on Dec 11, and my identity verification is  STILL pending. 
I've emailed their support, I've messaged them on Facebook and Twitter, and have received 0 follow up. It's terrible!

I haven't gotten around to it. Just checked out the site, can't say it looks great. Now that you say it's Chinese .. it does look like a Chinese site. 
I'm trying to move my stuff off coinbase to GDAX first. But I'm encountering a verification issue, even though I'm already verified on coinbase. Anyone else getting the same thing ?
