Almost definitely MDMA. I've seen these for sale on the various Tor/i2p marketplaces. Exact pill, same color and everything. Knock offs are sometimes made by people wanting to get a slice of the money associated with a certain type of ecstasy pill, but there's a good chance this is the real deal. 
Ecstasy pills are, in a way, almost brand-named. Blue supermans, yellow something-or-others (I think they're triangle shaped), androids (shaped like the lil Android robot), bitcoins. That's how I got my guess.
Safety note: don't ever trust a random club drug just because you've had a similar "brand" before. It's not hard to make knock-offs, anybody with a pill press can make these.

All4BTC has a Chrome extension that adds a "buy with bitcoins" button to Amazon. I think it does a couple other sites too but I'm not totally sure.

I imagine it's to create a speedball sort of effect. Hard to say for sure though.

this was already possible through the all4btc.com extension

The lower transaction fees are a great reason to pay someone in bitcoins. You can transfer any amount of money in bitcoins for a couple cents. What's not to love, right?

2C-B is the bomb from what I've heard. Still, I'd be really pissed if I bought an MDMA pill and it turned out to be 2C-B. Just tell me what I'm buying dammit, I'll almost definitely still buy it!

Pills like these are normally around 200mg. The pills themselves are normally around 10 dollars. At $565 a bitcoin, you could probably get about 65-70 of these pills (you always get discounted for buying in bulk, especially in the drug trade.) If you took 65-70 200mg pills, that'd be 13-14 grams of MDMA.
Half an ounce of MDMA all at once? You would be dead as a doorknob, man.
