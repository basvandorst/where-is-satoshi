Found the guy who sold his bitcoin years ago when it was a few hundred.

What? I've got no reason to lie about this? I did it as a test with old btc from years ago and I had read if it was coinbase to coinbase it wouldn't charge.

the only thing on the flash drive is electrum itself, is it really that bad?  I have the seed in person so it never is actually on the computer itself.  And if it does corrupt, i can just redownload the electrum anyway right? its just for the quick temporary movement of crypto, not to store it on pc

What's the best place

Can you explain how it's hard to liquidate bitcoin? I'm new to this.

But that wouldn't affect my crypto in any way correct? I'm fairly new to wallets separate from coinbase/gdax.

Awesome. I'm actually trying to install tails using a partition on the flash drive
itself, then a persistent volume. Having troubles so far

Not sensitive, just pointing
out every time a non american mentions their football, it's always accompanied by an insult.

I see, I was on the GDAX site but couldn't locate the wallet. Must've not looked hard enough. Thanks

Put money in that won't affect you now or the short term. Forget about it as best as you can. Hope for the best.
