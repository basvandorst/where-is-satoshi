As has been already mentioned in the thread, bitmessage is such system. Without details, the basic concept is
1. p2p network, very similar to bitcoin nodes
2. addresses are hashes of public keys (just like traditional bitcoin addresses)
3. you write a message by signing with your private key and then encrypting with the recipient's public key; then you broadcast the message in the p2p network
4. you encrypt the full message, including all metadata
5. everyone receives every message, tries to decrypt it, and iff decryption succeeds, they are the recipient
6. everyone stores all received messages for 2 days (?), so to receive messages, you don't need to be online all the time
7. message reception by the recipient is acknowledged by sending an ACK back to the FROM address
8. if you are offline for more than 2 days, and hence miss a message, the sender will know due to lack of ACK, and can try to resend
9. spam is mitigated by the need of doing Proof of Work when writing a message

Consider the following scenario. Bob has a payment channel on the Lightning network with Alice, and You also have a payment channel on the Lightning network with Alice. Now you can pay Bob using these two channels.
If Alice is Bitpay/Coinbase/Amazon/NSA/&lt;popular hub connecting many people&gt;, then you don't need to close the channels because next time when you want to pay Steve, Steve might also be connected to Alice (not necessarily directly).
And because of the network effect, it is likely that there's only going to be a single Lightning network, to which "everyone" is connected, rather than many small segregated ones (just like with the Internet). Hence, Steve is likely to be connected to the same Lightning network as you, so you don't need to close the channels and retrieve your bitcoins on layer1.

So if I understand it correctly, you are describing a double spend.
1. transaction at time t: A --&gt; B
2. transaction at time t+delta: A --&gt; C (same bitcoins)
There is an imperfect defense mechanism against this, namely when honest nodes receive transaction 2, if they have already received transaction 1, they will not propagate it (pass it on) to other nodes (nor will they consider it a valid transaction themselves). This effectively stops an ordinary person do a double spend, but not an advanced attacker.
First, you have to notice that if delta is large, transaction 1 will have propagated through the whole network before transaction 2 is even broadcasted.
Second, if transaction 2 is broadcasted spatially close to transaction 1 (at the same computer, or just a few low latency hops away), then most likely all the nodes that see transaction 2 have already seen transaction 1, so they consider it invalid.
Therefore, an advanced attacker could execute a double spend as follows:
Suppose wallet A and wallet C are both owned by the attacker (Alice), and wallet B is Bob's. Alice wants Bob to think she paid, but at the same time Alice wants to keep her bitcoins. Alice knows where Bob's node physically is (the node Bob uses to check if Alice paid). Let's say it's in New York. Now Alice gains access to another node in New York. She also has a node in Australia. Alice broadcasts transaction 1 in New York (paying Bob), but also broadcasts transaction 2 in Australia (paying herself, with the same coins). She chooses delta such that
1. Bob's node in NY sees transaction 1 first, AND
2. a large fraction of the network sees transaction 2 first
thus transaction 2 has a larger probability of being mined and getting actual confirmations, as it has more mining power behind it.
If Alice can execute this, she can successfully double spend. While this is hard to do, this is why zero-confirmation payments (of large sums) can't be relied upon.
Double spends are the reason we need the block chain in the first place. The block chain provides a time ordering of transactions without need for trust. That's why it is an interesting and useful invention.
Also, back to your question, as far as I know transaction fees are not taken into consideration for choosing between transaction 1 and 2. Every honest node considers the first it receives valid, and the second it receives invalid.

Litecoin does not have a malleability fix currently. Miners are currently also voting there whether to activate SegWit.

Not necessarily. If they are doing it well AND the fee calculation algorithms in SOME wallets are imperfect, then they could stop sending high fee TXs but everyone else would continue using high fees.
The idea is that
1. they artificially increase the fees by flooding the network with lots of high fee TXs
2. the market/network adapts and everyone starts using higher fees for TXs
3. now everyone uses higher fees, time to stop (perhaps gradually) sending the artificial TXs
4. the fee estimators in some wallets look at past fees and see they are high, so they continue using high fees

I think this could be solved by implementing a new opcode that checks the hash of a block at a given height. Using this, you could embed into the tx that at height H (current height), the hash of the block is X. However, the size of a hash is 32 bytes, resulting in a non-negligible increase in transaction size.

Use multisig. It's a no-brainer, really.
For example, use a 2-of-2 wallet with your PC and your phone as cosigners.
Better yet, if you happen to have two phones, make it a 2-of-3; that's probably more convenient.

On-chain scaling is necessary but it can't continue forever. We could scale up by a small constant factor but scaling won't be able to keep up with demand. There is an almost unbounded demand for on-chain transactions. Lightning or another higher layer solution is unavoidable if you want adoption to continue.

I would like to point out that there is both an offset and some scaling difference between the time axes. This is a bit misleading, as at first glance it seems there is a crystal clear relation between the graphs.

@_date: 2017-03-13 11:18:18
There are two scenarios/timelines to interpret your question in.
1. There is a hard fork resulting in two chains, and neither of them dies for several days. Average Joe will wait for the market to decide, and postpones buying.
2. Same as before, but now months+ later, with still two chains. Joe sees the two chains, looks up which one is more widely accepted, which seems to be backed by more exchanges, shops, sites, and people, and buys that.
Joe will buy the coin that Steam and eBay accepts. The coin better marketed by BitPay and Coinbase. Or the coin he can use to buy some weed with. He won't care if people are saying "this is Satoshi's original idea", "this isn't Satoshi's original idea", "that gives power to miners", "this helps decentralisation". He has no clue what these mean.
Average Joe goes with the stream. Does what the market suggests.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:54:40
It it comes to having to choose to buy between BTC or BTU, things will already be looking pretty grim. Hopefully, even if a hard fork happens, one chain dies. I sure as hell hope the chain with better developers keeps going, as only that will have a reasonable chance at long term success.

I don't have BitGo-specific knowledge but fees for bitcoin transactions have been a bit high recently (for all transactions). Think on the order of 20 cents (USD) - irrespective of transaction amount (as that doesn't matter).


Not sure, see above.


No. Paper wallets are "paper" wallets. You write down private keys on physical paper and never use it. When you need to use it, you enter it into a wallet, pay someone, and write down the new private key (for the change) onto paper. Obviously, this is a bit "extreme", and is not worth it for small amounts, or not at all if you don't feel savvy enough.
Using breadwallet should be fine for you (and most people). You will now be in control of your private keys (while with BitGo or Coinbase you are not, that's a traditional banking relationship instead). Just make sure to write down on paper your seed (the "horrendous pass phrase") - that is your only way to get back your bitcoins if you lose access to your phone.


Yes, you pay yourself (your breadwallet address) from the bitgo wallet. Yes, you will have to pay fees.


Advice for transferring from Coinbase most likely applies in your case as well.

People who want bitcoin to be a store of value first, real hodlers, don't have wallets with bc.i and likely didn't fill whatever survey this is from. People who have wallets there are likely to transact more, hence they likely want "fast and cheap" transactions, and generally want bitcoin to be a medium of exchange first.
You can't ask people who transact more than the median whether they want to transact cheaply because they are **not a representative sample**.

What are we talking about exactly? I'm looking at the charts right now and to me it looks like business as usual.
When I saw the meme I thought it would be ~1500 USD/BTC but certainly less than 2000... Everyone should just calm down. Literally nothing interesting happened.

It's a feature that we don't disallow anything on the protocol level.

Bitmain's threat of hardforking is an incentive to try to stick to the BIP148 UASF chain, you are right. Anyone who decided to mine/follow the UASF chain will still do that regardless, and Bitmain leaving the legacy chain means there will be even less mining power there. Hence, the legacy chain will have an even higher risk of wipeout. If Bitmain really hardforks, running a BIP148 enforcing node actually becomes the sane decision.

When exactly was that again?

It is instant on the micro-economic level though, which is what users care about. If you yourself send a segwit tx, it will take "less space" from the traditional 1 MB limit.
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:06:07
This. Why are they not signalling BIP141 SegWit?

When he says person-to-person, that also includes person-to-company and company-to-company. What he means is A pays B. So none of the more complex, "smart-contract-like" payments.

Indeed. [gmaxwell's answer](

False. Wallets generated by [Bitcoin Core 0.13.0] ( and later are HD by default.

You sure about that? Sure, it is informal usage, but still.

Electrum does give recommendations. There is in fact a slider for ease of use that guesses how many blocks the first confirmation will take.

It clearly says "Community-managed support breakdown by company for each active Bitcoin proposal". Not nodes. Companies. Good thing you read it before commenting.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:49:33
Aha. So by top developer, you mean single "best". Then please reread my comment:




I considered "world top developers" to be  (say) 95 percentile.

I wonder if it will rain in Central Park, NY, 10 years from now. You have similar chances of telling. Probably better chances for the weather, actually.

This. So much this. Bitcoin is permission-less, and for a good reason.
People who complain about darknet or drugs or whatever, don't get it. It's a feature, not a bug.

Considering block height 1,000,000 is ~10 years from now, that's pretty conservative.

When something is opt-in, and only a minority opts-in, you can't conclude that that something is not supported by the majority. I guarantee you that if it was opt-out, BIP148 UASF would be supported by a majority. The simple fact is that many people don't act in either direction generally.
As for this particular situation, e.g. if Core merged in a PR that made UASF opt-out (enabled by default), only a minority would opt-out.

With Electrum, using the current up-to-date release, you can already be on whatever fork you want if you find an Electrum server that follows it (you just need to connect to it). There are several servers enforcing BIP148 right now.
Also, there is a new feature being developed, most likely included in the next major update, that allows [configuring "checkpoints"]( Which make all this [even more seamless](
