The Foundation actually makes studies?
Don't get me wrong. But I thought they only do next to nothin really good for us.
Is there an archive to see into every study they have done? I'd like to look a bit deeper into their work.

I'm sorry didn't listen, that song came out of nowhere! Not a currency what?

I'm afraid to ask but where did that Whoosh come from?
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:57:47
Want to use it! But I think I need to wait until the next major update comes for this.
 
This is bound to having a Coinbase right? Don't people from Europe get problems with this?

I'm missing a Classic Steve in there. Or some Mark.

In my case nothing got lost. All good, just logged in and pulled my fresh bought coins out.

Mistakes happen. The crypto currency scene is full of mistakes. Just give the admin(s)/dev(s) a break and try again soon.

Nope. No more words needed, sorry.

Change the style of your full grown beard every few weeks/months and your done.
  
For your eyes: colored contact lenses.
Hairstyle: A new tinfoil hat every week and you should be good to go.
 
There officer, take a photo.

C-C--Can I touch it?

It's called Bitcorn god damn it!

_Yahoo who?_
@_date: 2014-05-06 16:33:24
Uh, you mean the one that I ripped out of my devices?
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:14:15
Can someone please screenshot or copypasta it?
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:22:59
Probably they mailed him again. And everyone else.

And this is the day which made me disbelieve in Bitcoin and sell all I have.
Sorry. I didn't knew stuff would come this bad. This is a clear sign that says "Project Bitcoin killed by gov".
 
Sure Bitcoin will continue to work, but not the way it's meant to be. I don't get why it's clear that everyone will instantly jump on that fork. Like Lemmings. Revolution has failed.
And I know this will get downvoted by all Bitcoiners who downvote everything that might show something bad happening from Bitcoin. Go on, downvote please and ignore what is happening right now.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:11:30
I'm so high right now
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:55:09
How was the trip? We need answers.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:09:55
Well, you could just - _wait_?
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:29:27
I didn't have a laugh over pure chaos and losing money like that for a long time!
@_date: 2015-01-14 10:08:03
Damn, it works! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:25:42
Because fuck you Apple!
