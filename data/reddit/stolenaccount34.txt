Yes, many unstable economy’s all the way up to countries continue to exist.
Yes. Investor are stupid and sometimes they are brilliant. 
 
What can bitcoin do besides provide a risky ROI? Tell me.

Can you post just one single example of what your talking about? I mean you had time for 20+ posts certainly you have time enlighten us.

 Be fair, how many call it bitcoin (bch)?

14 posts and OP didn’t provide a single fact supporting his position or relaying new info about the subject. Is this what crypto discussion is coming to?

Exchanges can not operate without the US dollar. Cryptos can only exist on a minimal level without exchanges.

I think there is compensation due from both the exchange and Mr Cryptsy himself in separate cases. As well as the outcome of the appeal.

My point is common stock doesn’t really make you a percentage owner of squat. A company can easily transfer all the preferred stock and assets to another shell company and leave common stock owners holding nothing but their dicks and worthless paper.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:43:16
McAfee says buying stock means you actually own 1% of the company. Makes me wonder if he has ever heard of common vs preferred stock.

I cant speak for others, but in the past every major technological advancement was met with competition. Whether it be Windows NT, Open GL, Red Hat Linux, the latest Intel processors, the use of HTML for web pages, each was given its opportunity and succeeded or failed on its merit. But only with cybercurrency has completion become a political shitstorm with little to gain by posturing.
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:09:03
Your absolutely right, If your in it for your heart or your emotion or your theism to a white paper than you will go home broke and robbed. Let the technology guide you to the truth.

I’m serious, how do I calculate that at today’s rates? I’ve been doing small deposits, but not $5. Does BCH charge per deposit too on withdraw? Or is it total price?

Just print a report from your exchange every few days and stick it in a folder for the year. 
Pay income tax on all your mining rewards, pay capital gains tax on anything you sell. If you get audited just hand the 2” thick report with thousands of transaction to the agent and let him figure out what the fuck is going on. I bet he wont bother to audit the whole thing.

A bank run typically meant that consumers lost faith in the banking system and would hoard cash instead.
But you make a good point in that it is difficult to envision people ever converting all there assets away from USD and leaving it worthless. What are they going to do hoard gold? Buy yachts and supercars?
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:00:35
They are just a software projects, no different then thousands before it. They will stand or fail on their own usefulness and productivity.  Why people choose to treat them like their favorite football teams is beyond understanding.

To buy something else that will perform better. It doesn’t matter if you sell, if your just rolling it into a different coin.

How does bitcoin fluctuate in response to the volatility of the world around it? How is bitcoins stability reflected in this relationship? Can you provide one concrete example?

Intelligible? You seek to be understood? Than have understanding.

I don’t see how restricting someone from talking openly about an investigation is a bad thing. If parties under investigation were aware of the direction of the inquiry, than they could easily manipulate and mislead the system.

If you sell low, AND keep it in cash you will lose. If you sell at 20% under the quarterly avg and buy another coin at more than 20% under the quarterly avg, then you are still right where you were. If the new coin performed better than the old than you are ahead now aren’t you?

He should revisit that, The Cryptsy settlement terms have been appealed.
@_date: 2018-05-19 02:49:41
I still think there is a lot higher chance of a cyber coin having a run pulled on it, and not having cash reserves in the exchanges to pay everyone out, than the U.S. Dollar. 
A failure of the U.S. Dollar would obliterate cybercurrencies.

When you get to that age, you should no longer invest in things with any risk. A typical portfolio for a retired 70yr old is bonds, some precious metals, municipals, cash and only the most stable long term stocks you can find like Disney and other entertainment stocks. Risk is for the young.

That Barkley quote is complete crap. If it was even close to real the TV market would be out of business since nearly everyone owns a TV. The reality is that the pool of people buying TVs didn’t shrink just because 85% of people already have one. Same with bitcoins, just because you have some doesn’t mean you won’t buy more at a later date when you get more money.

I don’t like the title because it makes bitcoin sound like some MLM which needs to recruit new users to keep the system alive.
Bitcoin needs to focus on supporting the customers and expanding retail locations. Then people will use it more and buy coins more often. Younger generations will use it because of its reputation and service.
There needs to be a buffer between the exchange rate and the daily use rate. Imagine saving 20k for a car, putting it in bitcoin, and then going to the dealer that weekend only to learn that your 2k short because of market fluctuations. Vendors would be more likely to use it if they didn’t have a different price every day for their product.

Ok, on the date your are paid coin you need to record that days price on an exchange. You will pay normal business taxes on this amount. When you convert to cash, record the price, the difference will be considered capital gains and may have several different tax implications.
