Yes, because people have an excellent track record of being capable of assessing the value of work done and tipping appropriately. Just ask a waiter, or anyone who has every done freelance work and tried to get paid for it.

We haven't spoken to them about it yet. I've talked to them about bitcoin in general (my spanish isn't great), and they seem interested. 
Boss was hoping to avoid dealing with lawyers, but if no more information pops up, he might not have a choice.

Excuse me? Bitcoin, not proven?

We were kind of expecting that other people would've done this by now, so there'd be some precedent we can follow. If we're really in uncharted waters, I'm sure he'll look into a good lawyer.

Yeah, I kind of agree, but I'm not too sure. They can always find other work. 
My bosses feeling is that they should either accept the transition, or start looking for other work. He said he would give people as long as they need (within reason) to find a new job (while paying them in fiat) if they don't like it. It's not exactly difficult to find people capable of working landscaping jobs. 
I mean, it sounds harsh, but if you believe in bitcoin, this is a necessary step.

Great! Thank you

That's my thinking as well. He's not going to do this without warning, he's going to tell them his plan and give them plenty of time to find other employment before making the switch.
Let the market do its thing, I think. If no one is willing to work for bitcoin, he'll be forced to switch back to fiat.
 My only concern is that some of the people we employ might be desperate enough to work for BTC even if they don't want to. They might not have a choice. That doesn't really jive with my way of thinking, though.

I'd argue that you're a good person if it's a punch in the gut in exchange for getting them out of the massive government scheme to kick them in the balls (ie fiat)

I think you might be right. I'll discuss it with him. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:14:43
That's uncalled for, I think.

Aren't lots of employers switching over to paying their employees with what are more or less gift cards? That's the reason we didn't think this would be an issue. Other employers in the area pay their employees with "pre paid" debit cards (cant remember exactly what they're called) and they got to do it without asking for employee consent.
