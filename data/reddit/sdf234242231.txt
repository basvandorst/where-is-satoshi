There shouldn't be any government departments who's goal is to actively fuck with businesses.. their purpose should be to do whatever is best - if they can get what they want with a 5min phonecall or email they should do that - not seize possibly millions of dollars of someone else's money as their opening move.. it's just vandalism. The MSB registration thing is pretty trivial.. it's just a form you fill out with information about who is running the MSB and pay a submission fee.. that's it.. there's no approval or anything. It's not like FinCEN has anything to gain from mtgox being registered other than knowing the information that they already have about them.

I guess.. I think I'd stop short of calling it 'good news' though.. it's never a good sign when governments selectively enforce laws in favour of local mafia/"businessmen" at the expense of others.

If this wasn't an attack on gox they would have contacted mtgox and asked them to register instead of getting a court order to seize their dwolla account.

I think it does.. although they may cut this off. When aurumxchange trialed a similar service they found you could even top up "non-reloadable" (ie, anonymous) prepaid cards - up to their initial funding amount.

this.. bitinstant is a massive ripoff really.. not to mention the inconvenience of going in person to a shop and talking to people on phones and cashiers etc.

It used to be very convenient to pay via credit card using liqpay.com.. that option nolonger seems to exist, but it seems like it may be possible to still use liqpay via interkassa - although I haven't tried it yet.

That is totally unworkable.. to use your car example, it would be like the cops throwing you in jail for running a red light.. sure in some circumstances that might be the right thing to do, but usually it isn't.

actually they do.. through interkassa. you make an interkassa payment and then pay it with liqpay.

It's already possible to buy BTC through btc-e.com via liqpay and interkassa using a credit card. The fees work out at around 3%. It would be nice if other people start offering this though. 
I think the main technique liqpay uses is triggering fraud alarms as soon as anyone tries to use it.. that way it forces the cardholder to call their bank and tell them to whitelist it before you can actually make any payments.

It may serve a purpose but it's not really a viable replacement for dwolla.
