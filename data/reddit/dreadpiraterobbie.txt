money rules every aspect of your life...directly and indirectly. especially in the west. we live for it, work for it, suffer for lack of it, dream of more of it, it dictates what time we wake and sleep where you live, where you can holiday, what you wear. your self image and self worth is linked to your ability to acquire it. People you see hurrying past are doing exactly the same thing. the goal is more money, more material possessions

banks are the middle men, central banks own the show, if they get rid of the middle man it focuses the power and control . a centralized global currency. rothschilds are bringing an end to fiat currency...bring on the cashless society!

your brother is a precautionary tale about 'values'... we put so much value on the material world. wealth, possessions, self-gratification and when those things dont eventuate, many give up. he'll be back in another body another life, as we all do.

that makes complete sense. So the question 'is btc going to die' ...is fud at best and misdirection at worst. btc is the future. ok ok the end of fiat paper money has been a long time coming.
whats your thoughts on the sustainability of BTC or look to alternatives?
