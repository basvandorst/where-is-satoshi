Yes, yes.
Lets see how this stupid sub tries to argue against the richest and one of the most successful investors ever. This should be good.
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:25:13
Thats seriously sad. Like genuinely. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:27:39
How is it not ideal and possible? It's incredibly easy to invest your money to keep it safe from inflation and the vast majority of the population do. This is what I'm talking about, you'd have to be incredibly young, never in a position to save money to save or just willfully ignorant to truly belive what you are saying. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:12:26
Massive world economies and the pretense that it is acceptable tender by a wide variety of vendors worldwide like I stated in my post.
Even the fact that the extreme few vendors that accept BTC do not keep it in BTC is evidence enough that other fiat currencies are far superior to BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:37:23
LOL CHEAP BITCOINDS I GUES LOL.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:06:16
How anyone could genuinely think that with a straight face is beyond me.
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:36:30
Yes, the man who is donating like 99% of his total wealth is pro-establishment and is just saying this to corrupt the free and super inteligent bitcoin users on Reddit.
Lol, Warren Buffet doesn't give a shit about establishment, he's too successful and too rich to care.

"Bitcoin, its a guaranteed investment! You will never lose money on it!"
- last month.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:07:30
Because this sub is full of conspiracy nut losers who upvote bullshit content like NSA related stuff to the front page.
This sub is a joke and a horrible representation for Cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:35:09


The Economy(US as I'm predicting you mean) is predicated on assets and production, bitcoin is based on nothing, it's backed by nothing. The majority of US debt is owed to the taxpayers through things like pension payments. The treasury doesn't just 'print money from nothing' .The fact that you try and compare the two show how ignorant you and many bitcoin users are to how finance actually works.


No you can't because no one ever says that Fiat currencies will carry on deflating indefinitely like many bitcoin users constantly claim. Fiat currencies are constantly managed in an attempt to be as stable as possible in response to the needs of the economy, that is not a bubble. Bitcoin users just assume that bitcoin will increase in value indefinitely till they become millionaires from buying $1 of bitcoin and constantly lie about its prospects and ignore any negative aspects of the currency, that is a bubble.

How is Bitcoin much better for international transfer? I can send money through western union and pick it up in some country in Africa and spend it right away. I can't do that with bitcoin. Some stall owner isn't going to be sitting there ready to take your Bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin is actually pretty much useless in the real world.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:48:40
Abahababahahaha fucking hell, is this Jesus fucking christ almighty ahahahahaah. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:32:33
I'm sure Amazons stock is literally tanking after you pulling out.
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:27:14
No you don't understand. People who are investing in bitcoins are technological pioneers and heros. They are creators of the future, according to this sub anyway.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:00:21
This is where people invest their children's college fund into this shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:19:53


This quote right here basically proves all my other points that it is pointless debating in this place because: 
A) You are all in denial.
B) You have very limited understanding as to how economies and finance works.
How you can even make such a statement with a straight face and genuinely think that was a logical line of thought is beyond me.
So you are genuinely saying that BTC has the same backing and guarantee as the USD and GBP. Lol, just lol. 


And converting it all into other currencies because they don't want to keep BTC.


Ahahaha, it just gets even better. Now there is this global conspiracy where everyone is holding vendors to gunpoint to change BTC into another currency or they will kill them. Jesus christ ahahahahaha. The lack of logic in this post, I mean god damn, god damn.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:13:44
Currency is a temporary store of value so you can exchange it for goods and services. 
Again your comment highlights how ignorant this subreddit is to basic finance. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:28:33


Lol, just lol. The delusion of people in this sub.
Its just funny to come in this sub and laugh at people like you.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:39:20
I bought into a pump and dump scheme, please keep chucking your money into the pit to protect my investment.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:13:50


Is this guy for real lol? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:48:17
He deleted his comments though, a lot of users on were praising him and telling him to buy more because Bitcoin obviously is going to be worth $1million per bitcoin in a year.
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:23:42


DA COMPANIES OF CURSE.
LOL I R ANARCHIST, DAE THINK COMPANIES SHOULD JUST RUN EVERYTHING?
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:39:14
Then you're using it as an investment not a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:05:45
Hey everyone I have a bridge to sell.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:31:35
Yeah lol I'm sure I'll trust you're advice over him, after all he's only one of the richest investors ever and your some random nobody that pumps money into a fad currency. You clearly know more than him lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:43:29


The fact that they are backed and managed by massive world economies. The fact that they are actually tradeable and can be exchanged for items and services by nearly everyone. Bitcoin is worthless as a currency and the few vendors that accept it readily convert it into fiat currency and do not keep it as bitcoin.
Bitcoin is backed by nothing. Dogecoin is a better currency then Bitcoin.
 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:43:02
Extremely negative if it is supposed to be used like a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:13:40
I answered the question, just because you don't understand the answer doesn't mean I'm wrong. I'm sorry I can't dumb it down even more for you to understand. But then again at the end of the day you think BTC is amazing and will never inflate so I'm not so sure its even worth trying to explain it further to you. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:03:29
The fact that it happens over 50 years and not 50 days is a testimony to its stability.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:53:09
My god OP you are one really sad mother fucker.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:42:30
I'M NOT GOING TO DONATE TO THIS BRILLIANT FREE ONLINE SOURCE I USE ALL THE TIME SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ACCEPT THIS STUPID CRYPTOCURRENCY AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
How fucking retarded do you actually have to be to hold this logic.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:07:52
There is a difference between 'use' as a currency and people buying bitcoins then sitting on them because they think they are going to be millionaires without realising that Bitcoin is nothing more than a bubble. 
People here are genuine idiots who think Bitcoin will do nothing but grow and that it is simply an impossibility that it can ever fall. 
is delusional.

in a nutshell
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:18:21
Bitcoin, not even once.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:53:50
Well, according to then you have absolutely nothing to worry about and you've basically won the lottery. Stay strong fellow Bitcoiner!
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:11:16
Wow OP, you are actually one sad motherfucker.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:26:07
Poorer countries that have a currency that changes more wildly than bitcoin need a physical representation of currency. Not a digital currency that requires you to have access to a computer and the internet every time you wish to use it. Its far easier for these places to just adopt another more stable currency of a nearby country.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:46:11
And they're still using it as an investment and not a currency. 
The majority of bitcoin users hope to sit on Bitcoin till its worth a lot in another usable currency like US dollars then exchange it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:18:44
Bitcoin is so stable that it loses 10% of its value when one website goes down.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:35:28
And yet Western Union is infinitely more useful.

Yeah man, I told them Dutch bastards that they should have held onto their Tulips. 
As soon as Tulip reachers a higher price I'm going to be rich!!! Any time now!
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:17:44
It's not advice lol. You're just scared because you're seeing you're stupid investment starting to fail and are desperate to try and instil any form of confidence you can in something you have a stake in. That's why you make stupid posts like this. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:25:54
You're putting more thought into it than 90% of subscribers on this subreddit then. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:26:48
Well has completely turned me off from using it or getting involved with it.
I mainly come here to laugh at the posts now.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:11:27
Its got fuck all to do with bitcoin. The article doesn't mention Bitcoin at all, OP edited the title to include bitcoin. Its nothing more than a circlejerk over NSA and Apple. 


Sorry I'm on my phone.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:15:02
Clearly not, because I'm not an idiot that cums himself anytime a bullshit sensationalist article about NSA pops up. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:56:14
This subreddit has nothing to do with Bitcoin and is nothing but a bullshit circlejerk of psedo-intelectuals and retards.
I'm unsubscribing.

Thanks, subbed!
