I was thinking of getting a second one as a backup but the ledger website still says the shipping to my postal code is like 45 euro.

Apparently this is not possible per the Ledger website as it will not pass attestation when you try to access a wallet app. You can also inspect the PCB to make sure.  As long as the device generates the seed you should be fine; However I did read that one guy bought one off of Ebay or something and it already had the seed created and had some counterfit documents with a "scratch-off" for the password so definitely follow the setup on the Ledger website.

I had mine on a software wallet and transferred to a Ledger yesterday, still a bit salty about the fees (~$18 USD) but I feel much better now that its on a hardware wallet. Should have probably done it sooner or waited but who knows when the fees will drop again. Hopefully once the BCH pump is over.

Maybe someday.  Do you think Lamborghini will make moon rovers?

Yeah. I have been. But I did buy off of amazon. When it was about $80. So pretty much the same price with the “normal” shipping at the time I bought it.

This might sound dumb or just be a coincidence but does Ver have any involvement in Vertcoin? I thought I read something regarding this on a post yesterday but my google searches have not turned up anything of value. I bought some the other day, but would rather not support this guy if possible.
