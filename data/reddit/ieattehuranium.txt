If you're a long-term retail investor, good ETFs are probably the best investment vehicle you can choose - at least for retirement savings.  
Non-conventional vehicles (e.g. Bitcoin) are also pretty good, and I own a small amount.  But it's definitely much more risky than conventional ETFs/mutual funds, and should not be a large part of your portfolio.

One more thing, as well: If you haven't already been responded to, it might be a good idea to post your case number here.  It's not personally identifiable to anyone except coinbase employees, so it couldn't hurt.

It's also possible that Google has been paying all of their employees in Bitcoin.  It wouldn't violate the "laws of physics," sure, but it's so incredibly unlikely that nobody would "guess" it.

I believe I'm correct on this, I just double-checked.  The flaw allowed people to determine the below two things:
1. Whether an email address was associated with a Coinbase account.
2. The display name associated with the Coinbase account.
Both of the above two issues could have only occurred if the attacker obtained an email address from another source (e.g. through phishing, or a vulnerability on another site).  
Just for the record, as well, Google does the same thing (and still does).  Try doing a password reset request with your gmail address.

I don't think that's actually true, Coinbase accepts 0-confirmation payments...  Is it possible that they sent the payments after the 10-minute timeout expired?

1. ACH can take 3-4 full business days, if I remember correctly.
2. When submitting an order, Coinbase will display the exact amount of time it will take before it's locked in.  That let's you confirm the exact date that you will receive your Bitcoin (and plan accordingly).

As a feature request, it might be helpful to offer the ability to propose changes.  As an example, Coinbase has actually been audited by a third-party:

I'm a little confused as to what you're saying here.  This wasn't a request on my profile, but on Bitcoin in general.  I don't think I'm interesting enough for the FBI to have a file on me.  
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:27:33
They could also do it the way Coinbase does (e.g. "You will purchase exactly X BTC for X price, please confirm"). 
@_date: 2014-08-24 19:56:11
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but Circle appears to be instant up to $500.  Coinbase is instant up to $1,000 (after verifications are completed, etc.).  
Circle is free, though, which is *very* nice.  I imagine they won't be able to keep that up for long, though.

1. Credit card no-interest promotions don't apply to cash-advance transactions.
2. If Circle doesn't code these as cash advances, they'll be getting dropped by their processor very soon.

So, at that point, you're making 2 extra payments to pay 0.9% more.

Care to give a source on that?  I'm *sure* that Coinbase has suspicious activity monitoring.  Just because they didn't catch this one incident, it doesn't mean that they have a completely unprotected system.

The difference is that, with regular spending decisions with fiat currency, you don't need to record/report capital gains/losses.  Companies will definitely step in and offer services to make this convenient, but the bottom line is that it's still another step that most consumers won't (immediately) want to take. 


It might not be directly profitable, but (theoretically) some major entity/government could (theoretically) do it just to reduce confidence in Bitcoin.  Again, not really likely at all, but still a risk.


Are regular consumers really going to want to worry about multi-sig or maintaining their own wallets and security?  There might be better "wrappers" for this in the future, but that's not here yet.  If another few exchanges go down (and enough people lose money), confidence will essentially be gone.


Mot a likely risk, you're right. 


I don't think you can run a full node without having the entire chain.  If that is the case, only a few big "nodes" will be able to run full-nodes.  Same issue.


This is definitely a potential solution, but then other issues pop up: How would this work with multi-sig exchanges/wallets?  If we're just doing ledger transfers, the exchange/wallet would need access to your keys to transfer funds out later.  
These are definitely all overcome-able risks, but they still are just that: Risks.

Also, they have a consumer phone number as a note on ACH transfers (saw that on my bank statement).  Calling that seems to bring up a "Hello, this is Coinbase, please leave a voicemail etc" message.

Nope, it applies for when you instant-convert to U.S. dollars.  Coinbase doesn't charge any fees, ever, if you don't choose to convert to U.S. dollars. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:40:17
To be fair, though, Circle does have a waiting time for bank transfers &gt; $500.  Credit cards are instant, but those have a ~2-3% fee (forgot the exact amount) plus an additional cash advance charge.  That probably adds up to ~5%. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:58:27

It's not a great solution, but I guess it will be necessary until Coinbase revamps their reporting.

You can definitely use non-Coinbase (e.g. Electrum) wallets with the Coinbase checkouts.  You just need to click on the "Send using a Bitcoin address" button (this will be opened up by default if you're not logged in to a Coinbase account).

I think this could be pretty convenient, actually.  Tapping a little device on a payment terminal is very easy (I do that with my phone every day, in fact).
You would, of course, have to trust that the payment terminal will not have you sign a "bad" transaction (e.g. that withdraws all of your funds).  That could be taken care of with some sort of display (e.g. like the Trezor).  
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:13:37
Unless I'm missing something, I believe the public key will be exactly the same.  Compressing keys just makes them smaller, so I don't see why Coinbase wouldn't want to do that.

Coinbase doesn't require it; it's an option that OpenSSL chose: 
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:42:23
According to my support conversation with them, that is the change (as well as fixing the paper wallet generation to have fully compressed addresses/keys).
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:00:42
That depends on which verification you mean.  When you start the verification credits, you're not actually being locked into a purchase - you're just linking your account in order to make purchases in the future.
Once you actually initiate the purchase, you will be locked into the price quoted to you (unless they've hit their daily limits, in which case you'll have to confirm that you still want to make the purchase).
(Also: or support are better channels for support)
@_date: 2014-08-30 11:47:01
Looks like Coinbase is actually a little better:
Definitely a small difference, but might still matter for larger orders.
@_date: 2014-07-27 11:53:30
Nope, I believe the issue is that the app is somehow mis-formatting API requests to Coinbase.  When receiving an error message, they're attempting to add that to the standard ACH fee for Bitcoin orders (1% $0.15) and getting a result of $0.15 (e.g. as you can't take a percent of a non-present value, and added to $0.15 = $0.15). 
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:33:59
Two things:
1. How does a third-party looking at the blockchain know that the brainwallet is "whiskers75-bitcoin-username"?  They would know that your wallet sent a transaction to that address, but nothing else.
2. For websites that *do* know that your brainwallet is "whiskers75-bitcoin-username" (e.g. for username authentication), they could achieve the same effect by simply having your regular public address on file.  Gribble (an IRC bot) does that already.
It's always good to consider decentralization, but I really don't think it's necessary here.  
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:55:52
It's possible that, due to the power being shut off, the payment wasn't sent out for &gt;=10 minutes.  In those cases, Coinbase marks orders as "Mispaid" and sends out a specialized callback to the merchant.  
Coinbase would still have the transaction log in that case, but it wouldn't be their "error." 
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:19:46
Except it doesn't actually work that way.  You just say it was an unauthorized purchase and, boom, you get your money back. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:40:42
See the second point, though.  They won't be accepting credit card payments for long if they don't code transactions correctly.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:25:13
I suppose you're going to be "not worrying about that shit" when the funds are all seized, too?
@_date: 2014-07-15 10:49:02

@_date: 2014-09-06 16:42:20
That's usually the case.  I believe indirect exposure (e.g. with an index fund) is generally considered acceptable, but direct exposure (e.g. actually owning shares of apple) is not.

Some people are really damn dumb. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 12:56:34

1. Contact Coinbase support.  They're the best ones to help with these issues.
2. Check your computer for malware, and reset your email password.  With Coinbase's device confirmation, an attacker needs access to your email before accessing your account.
@_date: 2014-09-07 21:46:00
This would not be convenient if it requires two separate devices.  Consumers like "one-tap" transactions.
Most CC transactions do behave that way (or with a swipe/tap + confirm). I usually don't get asked for a CVV/DL. 
I think a better way to do this will be to have a "Tap/Click to confirm XYZ" transaction display (e.g. like the Trezor).  That would allow malware to be essentially taken out of the equation. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:34:19
Sorry about that, I got a little busy and this got a little distracting.  Deleted my comments to temporarily de-distract myself.

How could this have happened?  How could your system have not caught that?
Nice customer support, but the fact that this could occur is *not* OK...

According to Andreas, their cold storage uses M of N signatures.  Coinbase probably just had one of the N keys in their office.

Not really.  A buyer can repeatedly buy stolen credit cards online and use them on Brawker.  The chargeback won't affect Brawker or the seller, so their feedback will not be affected.

Don't ever connect the printer to the network.  Once you've printed out all of the private keys you want, take out the storage and destroy it.  If you want, also put in new storage so you can print out more.

That's a horrible thing to do.

That's not how it works.  The bank can own $X billion, and can lend out $0.90X billion.  That expands the money supply, since both the depositors and the borrowers have money in their account.

But...but...dollar bad Bitcoin good!
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:53:40
It's based on ACH delays; Coinbase actually waives them for most purchases (e.g. as long as you've verified your account, etc). 
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:36:26
Very cool!  Don't see any reason *not* to use Coinbase at this point, considering that we can control our own coins. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:40:33
Bank transfer confirmations can take up to four business days.  There aren't enough miners and the difficulty doesn't auto-adjust. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:58:19
Keep in mind that Circle probably IS charging a fee with the exchange rate.  If Circle has a 5% higher exchange rate than Coinbase, you're essentially paying a 5% fee.  Coinbase's 1% would beat them by far.

Alright.  Do you know of any other edge cases that throw Coinbase out of consensus? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:51:15
Very cool!  Just one thing I'm confused about:


How long can one take to authorize the request before the charge just doesn't go through?  Can existing card-processing software handle those delays? 
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:56:08
Back up for me.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:37:14
Weird.  I've gotten the free fees as normal.  Have they enabled instant-exchange on their account (  I'm 99% sure that they'll need to do this to get the fee frees.
Also, would you be able to post your case number here?  I know a few Coinbase employees browse this subreddit, they might be able to help.  
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:40:42
~$3 more than Coinbase.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:13:28
Yeah, the key thing here is that you don't have to use this feature.  They have "instant verification" and "deposit verification."  Deposit verification takes a few days; instant verification is just for people that don't want to wait.  
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:37:34
No, I've ordered on Monday/Tuesday and gotten coins by Thursday/Friday.

Coinbase locks login attempts for 24 hours after a few failures.  I'm not entirely sure on the amount, but it HAS happened to me after 3-ish failures.

You will, this is essentially a sensationalized display error.  
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:09:32
They do actually have a phone number:   It's a voicemail, but I think they'll call you back.  You can also email them at merchanthelp they usually get responses to me within 1-2 hours (later on if I email at 1AM, though :)). 


Agreed!

Coinbase has both email (device verification) and phone-based 2FA (Google Authenticator and Authy).  
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:41:21
I think his point is this:
1. Circle's CC transfers are essentially worse than Coinbase's instant purchases, especially considering the 2-3% cash advance fees.
2. Circle's bank account transfers are not instant above $500, which is a pretty serious limitation (especially considering Coinbase's $1k+ instant limits).  
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:07:29
Have you tried contacting support?
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:14:21
Wow.  This is *huge*!

That is ridiculous... at least Coinbase only does that 2-3 times a year.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:23:30
I think it was small because someone else already reported it ("duplicate").  I imagine that was the cause of the delay, as well (e.g. they already fixed it and rewarded the original reporter, but forgot about this duplicate).  
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:05:49
Coinbase also has a POS app:

Not that anyone would do *that*... *lie* on the internet.

The only time that Coinbase has held my funds is when I received an order over my daily limit.  I emailed support and got that resolved very quickly (1-2 days, if I remember correctly).  
Anyways, I guess a very small minority of people have had issues with Coinbase.  That's true for every company, though, tbh.  I'm surprised that more people don't post to reddit, actually, considering their large userbase!

I'm pretty sure that's not actually the case.  Authy requires you to authenticate via *SMS*, not email.  You can't get the 2FA tokens (or reset your account) with email.

Feel free to counter any of these, but I've listed a few off the top of my head below:
1. A major government might ban Bitcoin or put too many restrictions on it for reasonable use.  Who would want to use Bitcoin if they have to meticulously track and report *every* transaction they make (IRS)?
2. The fact that (this might not be the exact figure) the current network can only handle 7 transactions a second.  That's nowhere near the capability needed for a serious/widespread payment network.  If that doesn't change, there's no way that Bitcoin can go mainstream. 
3. More exchanges might go under, triggering a significant loss of confidence.  If enough people leave Bitcoin before it goes mainstream, we're done.
4. Once enough transactions are created, regular users will not be able to download the entire blockchain.  That might lead to a few big "nodes" who keep the blockchain and handle transactions, and everyone would then need to trust them.  (This might be countered with cheaper/more consumer storage space, but that's not guaranteed)
5. A major entity (ghash.io, anyone?) could obtain a stable &gt;=50% of the network.  We then have to trust them not to double-spend transactions, etc.  Not a great situation. 
Those, again, are just off of the top of my head.  I'm sure I can think of more if I really try.  
(Also, please don't get me wrong here.  I love the idea of Bitcoin and hope it succeeds.  It's just that saying risks aren't present is just not true.)
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:06:57
Nope.  I can give you their typically-1hr response support email, though:
Better than Circle's 2hr/d phone support.  :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:24:08
I guess his idea is that it doesn't really matter once the coins are in the brainwallet, since you're going to be authenticating with the personal wallet anyways.
I guess the thing, then, is why not just make a signature with the personal wallet?  What extra value does the brainwallet really add?  Unless I'm missing something, signing the below with your personal wallet would be the same thing:
"whiskers75-bitcoin-username $currentTime"

It's not actually, at least with coinbase.  They guarantee the payout after marking an order as completed.

They do, actually.  It's on the merchant settings page.

It's essentially exactly like Coinbase, except you don't know how they make money.  I imagine the exchange rate is going to be worse than what Coinbase offers (maybe 1% + $0.15 worse?).  
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:11:00
Because he's dumb and hasn't thought it through, probably.
@_date: 2014-07-19 22:59:58
1. Nope, it would still be processed as credit.  Coding doesn't affect fees on the merchant's side.
2. Even if it were possible, it would likely get the merchant dropped by their processor.  Miscoding is frowned upon in the credit card industry. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:27:20


Why would employers use this, then, if they have to pay more?
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:30:24


That's not actually how it works.  Coinbase uses [Authy's reset process]( which requires much more verification than just email.  


They are.

It doesn't look like a scam, but I'd still say Coinbase is the better option (for now, at least).  Mostly because Trucoin charges an outrageously large fee for someone who also has access to other options (e.g. Coinbase).  Right now, the Trucoin fee works out to about 6.9% (5% standard fee + ~1.9% worse exchange rate than Coinbase). 
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:01:02
1.  If they went unanswered, Coinbase has not actually received your emails.  All emails get an automatic acknowledgement response from their ticket system.  You should probably try re-sending them or, if it still doesn't work, submitting them on   They also have a dedicated merchant help email: merchanthelp
2. The 30-day wait period requirement is only required for level two verification.  You can still sell up to $3k per day without having that verification.  It's not required/forced at all.
@_date: 2014-08-30 23:59:37
They essentially "lend" him the money until the ACH withdrawal goes through.  No way they're going to be able to maintain that without charging fees. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:05:37
Based on their documentation, the multisig wallets appear to utilize deterministic keys.
In other words: One set of private keys is generated, but additional addresses are then generated based on those private keys (e.g. with the hierarchical deterministic structure).

You might lose your job.  You might have unexpected expenses during a Bitcoin crash.
Putting 6-12 months of your salary into Bitcoin is a *horrible* idea.  If you lost it all in a second, you can't tell me that you would not be devastated.

That's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:03:15

Coinbase didn't leak any email addresses.  They "leaked" the name associated with the email addresses.  
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:15:36
Perfect experience here (customer of 1+ years, bought a large amount of Bitcoin with them).  As I said in my previous comment, I've had a few small hiccups.  They've always been resolved professionally and promptly, though.

@_date: 2014-08-03 11:39:37
Or, more likely, Coinbase was trying to figure out what went wrong when this user decided to complain on Reddit?  Nahhhh, has to be the shady one!
@_date: 2014-06-24 19:23:41


I would say "vast majority."  Keep in mind that, although we do see a bunch of issues on reddit, they have over ***1.3 million users.***  You're only seeing the *very* small minority.

Have you tried contacting their support?  In all of the cases I've seen (including mine), that has immediately resolved the issue.

It actually will work for Coinbase, not sure about Circle.  Coinbase sends funds from an address you own. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:57:21
Hah, wow, missed that.  
Out of curiosity, where did you get a generic card like that?
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:27:11
Not a Coinbase shill, just a customer. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 22:27:23


This is so ridiculously sketchy.  
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:48:23
They are.  Coinbase counts them as "mispayments" and forwards them to the account.  
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:33:18
The barista wasn't knowingly encouraging the illegal activity.  


"The alleged was not suspected of doing anything illegal except for the illegal stuff he did."

Makes sense.  Is it still normal if it doesn't show up after an hour?
@_date: 2014-07-20 12:19:18
1. Coinbase.  They have no fees for your first $1m in transactions, which you probably won't be going over anytime soon (I hope you do, though!).  With Bitpay, you'll be paying fees from day one (not to mention that Coinbase has a large amount of users that can pay with 1-2 clicks, and can handle refunds with ***much*** less of a hassle - 2 clicks vs. a very manual process).  
2. You won't have to pay any capital gains/losses if you choose Coinbase's "Instant Exchange" option.  That makes sure that you don't have any gains/losses.  
3. For accounting software, Coinbase has *great* reports that include all of your orders' details.  They can talk to you about that if you email them: merchanthelp
4. Easy.  For Coinbase, the account setup process takes 1-2 business days at most.  Once that's done, you just need to load up an App on your phone for customers to scan.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:52:47
It's almost definitely credit card fraud.  Purse's volume can't all come from the unbanked population.
@_date: 2014-09-07 22:51:31
Yup, I imagine you're probably an edge case with that.  I think some POS systems will automatically require additional information if your purchase is deemed "risky" (e.g. with non-local billing addresses).
Agreed that an NFC trezor would definitely would be awesome.  
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:45:06
As long as you know that Amazon's footing the cost once the chargebacks come through...
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:44:43
Coinbase actually responds within hours, in most cases.  This guy just wasn't patient enough to work out the issue with them. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:37:28
Yeah, exactly - no capital gains is *very* attractive. 
(Although not so much if you lose funds!)
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:59:39
Have you emailed support explaining that the Change Number page doesn't work?
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:28:55
Yeah, you're probably right about that.  How *would* someone ensure that the "fake" transaction is mined?
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:05:37
I've asked them to clarify.
I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted, though.  This is a top-10 broker, so I'm definitely not the only one affected.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:14:22
Hm.  I haven't ever had this issue before; it might just be something with your account (or something that only happened once).  
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:36:49
Oh, that makes sense.  It's too early for me to be on reddit.  
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:32:57
Not 'maybe.'  It's in the research paper.

I think Coinbase might be better for GoCityHotels.  They're fee-free up to $1,000,000.

That's for webbtc.com, not Coinbase, and was from over a year ago.  Even if there *was* a bug in Coinbase, I imagine it would be long-fixed by now. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:57:08
I personally do not believe that purchasing items on purse.io is very ethical.  I'm sure that a **large** majority of the 'sellers' are scammers who are either:
* Using stolen credit cards, or
* Planning on reporting the transactions as unauthorized and re-obtaining the funds.
In both of these cases, the merchant (Amazon) suffers a complete loss - at your personal gain.  In my opinion, it's essentially theft.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:37:01
Do you have a Google account?  The same thing can happen there.

If anyone wants to see another open-source IRC tipping bot,   It's really badly-coded, but it was a fun weekend project.

They fixed that recently, if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:38:12
Or, instead of posting on Reddit, actually contact Coinbase's support.  They really do respond fast.  They used to have support problems, but they've greatly improved.

I think you might need to consult some of those lessons before "investing" in an ASIC.  ;)
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:26:32
It might also be important to note that this was a duplicate (e.g. that someone already reported this before you).  The terms of this bounty say that:
"The minimum payout is $1,000 in bitcoin for **reporting a previously unknown security vulnerability** of sufficient severity with possibility for direct exploitation" &lt;-- I imagine it was already known about at the time of your report?

 explains it a little. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:13:02
Do you have a source for that?  It seems like my brokerage has actively blocked non-accredited investors from trading, so I'm inclined to believe that it's not just the person who responded to me.
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:42:12
A little bit - I have a Yubikey secured wallet, but not as good as the Tezor.
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:31:50
I would read a bit about how Vanguard works (and its corporate structure).  Vanguard is one of the best companies to work with (and is probably a great choice when looking for diversified index funds).

Nope?  Their customer info was never hacked. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:50:37
Not necessarily, I've read some pretty good critiques of Bitcoin.  It definitely has a lot of problems.

Any website of reasonable scale that needs to send out invoices to customers?  
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:41:50
No worries.  I'm not worrying too much; just would be nice to see my order online.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:30:37
1. Nice, they'll be able to help.
2. That is 99.99% likely to be the cause.  It's possible that it was more of a "quick try and steal as much Bitcoin as I can" type of malware (e.g. that does not care about longer-term access).
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:42:21
They just emailed back.  BIT will need to contact Vanguard's compliance department explaining that investors do not need to be accredited.
I've reached out to BIT; hopefully they're able to help here.
@_date: 2015-05-23 12:30:21
The site now has a "Donations needed for recovery" message...
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:11:32
Yeah; my brokerage also does that, but this one is presenting a different error ("Buy orders are not allowed" vs. "Please call us to place this order").  
Hopefully they'll be able to manually let me trade, as well.
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:36:04
Not really ideal, but you could always just buy some retirement mutual funds (e.g. VTTSX) and put those in a regular, non-tax-advantaged account.  
Better to save something than nothing! 
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:57:30


I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.  If someone is willingly taking a higher loss than they need to, something's going on.  
Sure, it could all be the unbanked (or some other people wanting to lose money).  But do you *really* believe that?  As opposed to the far more likely reality of card fraud - one of the only businesses where taking 10% "losses" is sustainable?
@_date: 2014-09-20 14:00:51
It's probably just a display error on the Android app.  If you load up the actual website (which is what matters most), I'm pretty sure you will not have a negative balance. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:35:56
He probably just made it up?
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:20:04
Yup, they responded saying that GBTC has not yet told them that unaccredited investors can invest.  Once the brokerage is informed of the fact, trading will then be enabled. 
I pointed them to their website that indicates the shares are freely tradeable.  Currently waiting to hear back.  
@_date: 2014-07-19 23:13:35
I've seen much less of those than before, I imagine they've really streamlined the whole review/whitelist process.  In most cases, the ones that do pop up seem to be resolved after actually emailing into support. 
(Saying that as a customer for 1+ years.  I've had a few issues, but they've always resolved them promptly and professionally.)
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:27:29
Seconding for Coinbase, always have had good experiences with them.  
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:42:47
I haven't downvoted you.  I just think that's a serious accusation that you might want to go into more.  
@_date: 2014-12-24 20:01:55
Also, are customers paying with a slow wallet (e.g. that's not synced, etc)?  You might want to email into their merchant help (merchanthelp about this.
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:38:08
It seems like that one's not mine; it's 100 shares at $101 (as opposed to 1 share at $100).

Great to hear; thanks for all of the updates on this.
Do you have any pictures of the pieces?
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:19:07
That was my impression, as well.  My brokerage, however, replied with this:


filed the necessary paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) to be an "accredited investor."
I've emailed them back to confirm, but it doesn't seem like just an internal policy.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:57:44
Looks like their wallet uses it, as well:   Enabling the link handler and clicking on a payment protocol URI works (e.g. with verified payment info, etc).
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:14:19
Yup, definitely a possibility. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:34:25
You won't get the 2% cashback for these transactions.  Assuming that they follow the credit card companies' rules, they'll need to code these as "Cash Advance" type transactions.  Those don't trigger cashback bonuses. 
Essentially, Coinbase is 1.9% cheaper here. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 11:20:04
Coinbase does (and they can also instant-convert to USD with a $1 minimum payment).  
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:41:34
Is that an actual card number?
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:36:24
Agreed, that might be the reality.  Many people seem to think that fractional reserve banking implies ridiculous leverage, though, so just wanted to clear that up.  
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:51:55
I would try contacting their support, that typically helps.
@_date: 2015-01-24 00:35:19


I think you might not understand fractional reserve banking.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:56:49


I hate to point this out, but these types of statements are why people think Bitcoiners are crazy.  :)
Unless OP's financial advisor is selling mutual funds, they probably should be listened to.  Only they know OP's actual financial situation. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 21:21:53
I'm not sure if I care either, but it's not good to spread misinformation like that.
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:42:35


Do you know what this is from?
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:17:33
That's not how fractional reserve banking works, though.  I think 10% reserve means that the bank can lend out 90% of the funds ($1.80m, in your example).  I'm not sure where you got $20m in trading funds from.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:10:58
Who else would want to take a 10%+ loss, when cheaper options are available (even Coinstar)?  
I think the "if it's too good to be true..." adage applies here.
@_date: 2014-08-29 03:58:15
Not to mention the conversion fee of 1% + their trading fees (see the fine print). 
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:36:58

Actually: With a Roth, you pay income tax immediately - but you never pay capital gains tax*.

@_date: 2015-05-20 14:33:34
Hmm, where are you seeing it? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:22:08
Some people don't like Coinbase because they manage everything for you (e.g. security).  You're technically taking on the risk that Coinbase will go bust, but I think that's a relatively minimal risk (especially compared to a security oversight on your part).
Also: Coinbase lets you exchange orders to USD instantly (so you don't have to take any volatility risk). 
@_date: 2015-05-09 00:15:50
I wouldn't be so confident in that guarantee, unless you have reliable logic and sources.  There would be a LOT of lobbying against that sort of change.  
And if we're talking about arbitrary new taxes, that could also happen to a 401k.  :)

I can't believe this hasn't been said yet, but I would 100% definitely not risk money that you need to pay for taxes.  
What will you do if something bad happens and Bitcoin goes down 75%?  What will you do if your wallet gets compromised?
It's ***basically gambling***.

Nice work.  Also, happy cakeday.

Because it will basically destroy the Bitcoin network.  Merchants would probably turn off payments, users wouldn't be able to send money to users on the other fork, etc.
You'd probably be able to handle it fine.  But the "average joe" that everyone talks about - what do you think he'd do?

Some of the time, that is the case.  What about paypal reversals?  Some reputable IRCers have turned into scammers.  
@_date: 2012-10-02 22:00:38
1: You can download the Satoshi client from bitcoin.org, for the wallet.  To buy bitcoins, you can do many things.  There are some canadians on  (an IRC channel on Freenode) that will accept a bank transfer.  There are also canadian exchanges such as 
2: You can't usually buy bitcoins with a credit card, as they are reversible and Bitcoins aren't.  I think you start the bank transfer to an exchange, so stealing bank information is unlikely.  Use common sense, don't give that kind of information to a random person.  Bitcoins are anonymous, although if the police can figure out you bought them at an exchange, they can get your information from an exchange.  If you don't give anyone any information except for your Bitcoin address, then you probably won't be able to be tracked.  
3: Wallet question answered above.  Wallets can be online, but it's a lot safer to keep them on your computer, as nobody except for you has access to them (assuming your computer doesn't get hacked).  You can do that, but that may take some knowledge of Bitcoins first.  As a beginner, I suggest to just put the wallet.dat (Google on where to find this) on a flash drive (encrypted with GPG; GPG is a completely separate topic, Google it)), and simply run the client with the wallet.dat on your flash drive when you need it.
4: Don't buy GPU's.  I don't know about FPGA's (specialized miner), but I'm going with the BFL ASIC's (better miner).  These likely won't be available for awhile, but you can preorder now.

I don't really think that could work well.  The number of commits does not necessarily reflect the amount of work put in (e.g. a dev could put 10 hours of work into figuring out some obscure bug, but it ends up being a 5-line fix).

I actually just wrote an essay that's somewhat related to Bitcoin, as well.  I can't send over the actual essay (for obvious reasons), but more than happy to give a TL;DR of some topics I wrote about:
1. Decentralized systems (e.g. Bitcoin) can promote innovation in industries that cannot obtain banking partners.  Think 'high-risk' merchants that banks typically avoid due to reputational risk.
2. Bitcoin allow for a reliable, non-biased, and provably correct ledger and clearing system.  It does so without requiring trust in a central third party.
3. A few examples of problems that Bitcoin could solve (e.g. making remittances dirt-cheap, giving otherwise-unbanked people access to modern financial systems).
Hope that helps; feel free to PM if you have any questions.

It was sorta implied.  Since the NAV is ~$12/$13, I'd say each share is about 0.1 BTC.

You can change the applet to require a pin; it's just a customize-able Javacard.  You can make it do anything you want; I'm sure you could make it require a OTP as well, which would allow you to manually allow the transaction (that's not currently implemented, though).  
This one is actually better than the TREVOR, since you can customize it to require whatever security features you want.

I highly doubt "all" of the companies have broken their privacy policy.  If you think Coinbase is breaking their privacy policy, you should report that to the FTC.  However, since you're just making that up, you probably shouldn't.  :)


Or, maybe, they're not using it in that way.  MAYBE they're simply collecting the information of people who reverse ACH payments, so they can block them later.

Yes, it will shutdown some businesses, but FinCEN has issued pretty clear guidelines on what to do.  If you follow the laws, you won't get shutdown.  Also: CampBX didn't say that they aren't spending money on security.  They're only saying that regulation costs a lot.

This is the problem, though; the sites on here have no proven reputation -- and no way to check if the people you are buying "advice" from are actually qualified.
The problem is that with a place like Bitcoin-OTC, if you get scammed, you lose a few hundred dollars.  With DoctorCoin, you could become seriously injured (by ignoring a serious problem).  With this lawyer thing, you could lose a lot of money.
As I said, a lot of regulation exists to protect the consumer.  People on here hear the word "regulation" and support whoever is against it.
Also: A lot of the advice I've been seeing on this site is just plain wrong.  Being in possession of stolen property is illegal even if you DON'T know that it's stolen, and the "lawyers" on here are saying otherwise.

It runs Java; you sign the transactions with the Javacard using the Bitcoin applet (you have to send commands to the Yubikey through an application on your computer; the privkey can't leave the Neo).

Mutum Sigillum, LLC is owned by Mark, if I recall correctly.
Also: It is VERY clear that it applies to them.  They are an exchange!  They are moving money around at the request of the users.  That is exactly what an MSB is.  On the paperwork, they explicitly said "no" when they were asked if they were an MSB.  They also didn't even REGISTER as an MSB!
In other words, MTGox was risking all of the users* money because they were too lazy to register as an MSB with FinCEN.
Also: For the inevitable "But they're in Japan!  The US laws don't apply to them!"  They DO apply to them, as they are doing business in the USA.

blockchain.info doesn't have your private keys if you're using their wallet service.  OP was using Shared Send, which is a coin mixer (NOT the same as My Wallet).
Their getting hacked wouldn't really do much (unless nobody noticed it and they managed to change the login page).

Silk road was shut down.  eBay lets you reverse the payment if you get scammed,  so there's not as much risk. Bitcoin OTC is FULL of scanmmers (multiple people get scammed everyday). 
It doesn't work with money,  why would it work with medical or legal advice?    It doesn't,  at least not without serious consequences.

That's how the real world works, though.  Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase use risky payment methods (such as reversible ACH), and their business model wouldn't work as well without fraud management.

This happened to me once.  It didn't actually submit it to the amount of nodes it was supposed to.  You can see this if you click on the transaction you are referring to (in blockchain.info).

I would say at this point, it doesn't make sense unless you buy it from someone who has a better place in line (which is more expensive).

Not really; CloudFlare is a legitimate company.  I'm sure they gave the location of the server to CoinBase when they complained.
If not, they DID take the proxy down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:04:29
Coinbase is not a random company, and they have your coins insured (they're also backed by a lot of venture capital).  If you're going to trust your coins with a web wallet, Coinbase is the one to do it with. 
Wallets on your computer are always more secure, though.
(No, I don't have an official source on the insurance thing, so don't quote me on this)
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:53:57
They don't do credit checks.  They run their fraud algorithm on all the information you've given them, and they came up as you being high risk.
They admitted that they were wrong and whitelisted you.  I don't see what fault you're finding in this.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:28:33
I don't get why everyone hates this so much.  It's fraud management; it's not like they're stealing anyone's money.  They return any money that they don't use for a transaction.

You could put something in between the Neo and the computer (raspi or arduino) and have it display it there before it sends it to the Neo.

What do you think a "good" answer to that would be?  I mentioned the proof-of-ownership idea in the OP, do you think that counts as an "overwhelming" answer?
I could probably come up with 100 arguments as to why it's "better," but they probably wouldn't be interested in a lot of them (i.e. it allows you to actually control your own money without interference and/or judgment from your bank).

You're right, they shouldn't be.  However, they should expect that they're not the only person submitting a support ticket; 2 days for a response from a medium sized company (not a small business anymore, but not as big as a bank) is perfectly acceptable.

I don't think it should be promoted in where a lot of new people come to see what Bitcoin is all about.  What would you think if the first thing that you see is a shady medical advice site?
The owner of the site literally said "If the doctor was trained in a jungle somewhere, I don't have a problem with that."  Judging by that qualifier, do you seriously think any of them are really qualified to be giving medical advice?
"Caveat emptor" is fine when we're talking about virtual currency regulation; I don't think this should be used when there are real lives at stake.

Keep in mind that it doesn't solve it if they ALSO take your 2FA code (and immediately logins with it).

I would have gotten over 0.20 BTC if Cryptsy hadn't messed up my deposit.  What really amazes me, though, is the fact that people are actually buying them!

As you can see with the Silk Road fiasco, Bitcoin is not done "without" a government.  It's done separately, just like regular currency.
Regular cash doesn't have a "ruler," per se.  The government can't just say "bill # X has not value anymore."  It's still regulated, though.
What you're saying doesn't make sense, but I'm pretty sure that you're trolling at this point, anyways, so I'm not going to respond anymore.

The problem is that people are coming to Reddit in the first place; if you worked at Coinbase, who would you put at a higher priority?  The polite person that's submitted a support ticket or the Redditor that made a post accusing them of scamming?
Also: They have 1000+ pending tickets with 5 support people.  I think 2 days is reasonable for that amount of traffic.

Alright.  I'm just trying to say that every company has exceptions to their order process; when they're processing hundreds / thousands of orders a day, one can naturally expect the number of exceptions to go up.

I might be wrong,  but I think they actually get someone to guarantee them the check,  similar to what happens when you pay with a credit card (Visa guarantees the funds,  even if the holder doesn't pay).

With the "viability" argument, Bitcoin only has the $ value to transact a few hundred expensive houses at *any given time*.
As soon as the seller of the house sells his/her Bitcoins (which, let's be honest, they'd do; either on an exchange or by buying something else, since Bitcoin is too volatile at the moment), they're back in the market, and can be sold for a house again.
I don't think that argument is really valid.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!

From what I've seen, Coinbase has been whitelisting people who asked them why they were marked as high risk.  If they were trying to scam people and screw them over on the price, I doubt they would do this.  They would just say "lol deal wit it XDLawls."
And with the 10 people that went on here bitching that Coinbase missed their ticket: I'm sure that they get 100+ tickets a day.  They're going to miss a few people; that doesn't mean that they're screwing everyone over.
