Amazing! We should all give a percentage of our earnings to a charity. Make the world better with crypto!

Exactly. Today I am going to a Crypto Shop (only accepts crypto for payment, sells crypto shit, etc) and purchasing something with BTC. Right after the purchase I am buying back the exact same BTC I spent. This is the best way to use BTC if you hodl
