It just costs a lot of money to create masks to fabricate ICs. Even modest fabrication technologies start around $100,000 for the first lot of 100 units. Newer (a.k.a. higher performance) technologies get even more expensive quite quickly.
There are other complications as well... you need lots of digital design and testing prior to fabrication, and if you get it wrong, your fabrication costs just went down the drain and you have to buy a new set of masks. It's also hard to precisely figure how much performance you can squeeze out of the ASICs until you fabricate them.
If you do all that, you'll need to package the chips, power and cool them, and write software to harness them.
To put the cherry on top, you'd better make sure you can make a system that can compete with the emerging ASICs long enough to make your money back AND weather the soon-to-increase total hash rate.

64 x 1 GHz RISC core. Very roughly estimating... each core might get bout 100khash/s or so? (Edit: this is a very rough estimate, but it feels okay given that 1GHz Pentium 3s are in the 200-300 khash/s neighborhood.)
So maybe 6-7 Mhash/s for the unit.
In other words, 15 of these to rival a 1 Ghash/s GPU rig; 800 of them to get to 50 Ghash/s ASIC territory.

Any solid computer engineer could **design** an ASIC miner. Creation is the hard (expensive) bit. If it weren't for the huge upfront costs, I'd be working on my own right now!

For their Capitalone360 program, they tell you a unique amount roughly equal to what you requested, and you have to deposit exactly that amount, which lets them correlate your deposit to you. I dunno about cash.

Down for me.

Actually, the fill price ended up being much higher -- you placed your order at $5.40 *per 1 BTC*. So the system filled your order with the highest bids at the time, which are the fill prices you see.
You effectively created a market order by selling so low, the system automatically goes and gets you the best price it can above your limit.

I have had zero problems with Bitfloor since they came back from the ddos.

Thanks for accepting Bitcoin! Ordered!
