To be honest that's a bit like the way I am as well, at least time wise. Quality wise I try to be better than most. 
How do you find a good manufacturer that will most importantly not skimp on quality, which I'm my eyes is more important than delivering on time.

That's exactly my problem. It isn't exactly hard to produce. I've heard that i s better to go to a place like Mexico where you are better protected from IP infringement. However when/if it becomes popular the Chinese will be able to copy it and make it cheaper. The question is then if I'll be able to build enough of a brand before the copying starts.

I've had a few ideas that never got further than the prototype stage. I've always played wit the thought of having one of my products created. I have heard a lot of horror stories about Chinese factories that makes te product but then manufacture and market the product themselves for a lower price. This is supposedly due to the apparently lax international intellectual property laws in China. Mind sharing your thoughts and opinions on that subject?

I've also heard that having a Chinese person do the negotiations will be muuuch cheaper than doing it yourself. So the mediator or OP will no doubt pay hims of back in no time.

Where can i download it?
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:13:05
I'm no HTML/CSS wizard, but that would definitely be worth looking into.

I don't know how bitcoins *really* work but how does software keep track of these coloured coins? Does every satoshi have an "ID" so you can see which Bitcoin or block it came from and which satoshi from that coin it is?
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:19:38
Forgive the ignorance, but *how* can the size be increased? Who ultimately makes the decision and how would they be able to change it? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:03:04
That is basically a less practical  version of banning, leaving it up the each one here to chela against that list. Neither will be effective because they Will create new accounts right away.

What's the point behind these connections?
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:22:06
Thanks, I'll definitely try bitWallet. I heard apple kinda refused to go along with the whole bitcoin thing, so I assumed there weren't any apps out there.

His account is 583 days old, he must be trolling us.

How much have you spent on parts and heightened electricity bill, in other words, have you made a decent profit yet?

I'm stil a bit new to Bitcoin, what is a node?

Are there 8 ways of superposing? I can only see 4.

Forgice the ignorance, but what's a XBT?
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:27:33
It would be better if they were sold now in stead of when bitcoin is fully adopted by most people.
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:28:23
Now it's at $1025 Holy $hit
@_date: 2014-11-25 17:12:27
Thanks, I'll pay it forward
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:30:21
Thanks for the reply but what's the use then to mention two identical values with one called "Value" and another one "Value at time of transaction"? I do not see how those could ever differ. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:59:05
Today was the first time I made a purchase with bitcoin in a physical store (it was the first time they accepted a bitcoin payment as well). When I had logged in to blockcain.info on my phone and tried to scan the QR created by Bitpay, no matter how many times we tried the QR couldn't be read and I had to type in the amount and address by hand. Anybody know's what the caused this inconvenience?

What's a satashi?
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:49:31
Thanks dude(ette)
I checked the math, which told me the first block was generated 5,7 years ago, which is 2009 so that check out. You said approximately though, is this a constant or is it determined by something else? I'd really like to read more about it, got any good place to start?
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:41:26
Why not use the more common btc?
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:48:41
It's really cool to think about that I own 5,9*10^-7 % of all the possible bitcoins. Compared to my local currency that huge.

Forgive the ignorance. Even though I've used bitcoin for about a year, I've just recently taken an interest in the technology behind it. What exactly is a node, and what does it do?
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:23:24
Couldn't captcha do this, as long as you need to log in after making a new account this would be the easiest and most obvious solution.
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:32:31
That second point would be great.
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:04:04
I'd guess it's in the high triple digits. Maybe not all but a majority of people heir savings in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:48:07
In blockchain it's possible to view the value at the time of the transaction, however I can only view the value in BTC which is weird since that value isn't changing. Is this a small bug or am I doing something wrong(leaning towards the latter)?
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:23:07
That's the camera, not the photo library. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:44:04
Is this 300.000 of the 21 million, or are there more bitcoins per block?
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:57:11
Just a quick suggestion, you guys have received roughly 25 dollars, wouldn't it be cool to make a handful of $1 paper wallets he could hand out for the ones who are interested? The kids will see it as "hey, I could buy a piece of candy with this" and might even go through the trouble of finding out more about how it works.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:37:37
But it's not *necessary* for these kind of small transactions and I'd guess it would be a good idea to implement a function that automatically creates a new address when a balance of let's say &gt;$10 is reached.

European here, please tell me this is a joke and that CC's and ATM's work in the US on weekends.

I was getting a bit worried over here, wouldn't be the first time you've been a bit backwards over there.

Enjoy it while it last eh?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:53:31
Wow Really? Didn't pop up on Bitcoincharts.com/charts
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:57:24
It's sad, but everyone who is a regular here knows it's not gonna last and more importantly not to put everything they have in something as volatile Bitcoin.

What's happening in August?
