Wow. I have been waiting for this day a really long time. I can't wait for them to add it so I can stop putting long LTC/BTC addresses in my song titles! If anyone wants to check out some of my music please do so :) It's all free download but you can donate in BTC or LTC if you want.

Cool. Yeah, these tracks on here are 6 months to years old. I'm working on a lot of new stuff as soon as I finish with some of my other projects, I have a big load of project files to get back to. Skip this Track pt. II and Spaghetti Triphop are both pretty unrepetitive and have like guitar solos and stuff. I don't know if that wins me any points but meh. 
Looking forward to making more music soon.

Only beats, no vocals except for some samples. Good lyricists are hard to find.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:18:29
Right. But how fast it propagates shouldn't have much relation to location or network topology relative to the receiving node as far as I understand.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:43:50
This was suggested to me in the past and it's under consideration :) This may be how I decide to do it, but obviously would never work if there is no baseline of interest.

Hey uh...so my birth name is Satoshi. My last name rhymes with saki photo.

If enough people want me to take that road I have no problem taking it. My experience has been that, going that way, there really isn't any revenue to speak of, so it seems I must be "selling" something or I'll be equated with a beggar in the btc community's eyes.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:33:06
See my comment above. My last album was bitcoin only, but bitcoiners hold pretty hard lately even though the theory goes that it becomes fractional. So I will let the community decide how my next release will go. I don't see any problem with gauging multiple communities to see which wants it most. Your opinion is welcome and reflects upon what I will decide to do. Like I said "you decide"!
Thanks for your interest.

The cookies can be placed in the mail and shipped to my address, at destination A. We can thus extrapolate that with two or three days time for the physical delivery network to process the transaction, recipient B will open the package and issue a confirmation to sender C. Data will then be transmitted describing the flavor, a buttery taste, as well as the 4lb round blue tin. Relatives D will then receive cookies and issue their own confirmations in the form of a nice comment. Metadata is then transmitted conveying the quality of the years Christmas due to said cookies, and the appropriateness of said cookies for other chronological events.

I thought this thread could use brightening up!

Thanks dude it occurs to me that Spaceflight at Midnight is kind of like a trap beat. I didn't really think about it. I'll check out more of tfares after Walking Dead. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:59:41
Nice :D
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:45:12
Thank you! What is your fortay? I may have something marked "private" that is more to your liking. I have hundreds of works.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:49:55
Darn :( Fresh out. A punk rock band going BTC would be cool though.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:30:11
Wow thanks! I've actually been around the btc community a really long time so I hope that's not how it looks. My last album was successful for Bitcoin so I only hope to justify making the next one BTC exclusive. I have been musicianing for bitcoin since ~2011.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:20:27
Wow really good mix. Nah, not exactly my style, the closest I would have is Alchemy, Spaghetti triphop, Skip This Track pt2 and Time. I'm more triphop than trap as my biggest influence is DJ Shadow. Really good mix though. Still listening to it.
**EDIT** You might also like ShadowTheory and Interference.

So let me get this straight. You are saying that since both nodes are close geographically and network topologically speaking, the time will be seconds between when the transaction is relayed to the node? To my knowledge this is not wholly correct and that it could still take 5-10 minutes just to show, but I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

@_date: 2013-10-03 01:24:04
Holy shit, this has my attention.
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:18:04
Do you think 20btc would be an attainable goal? I also have a friend who makes "music videos." I will see about working with him on something.
@_date: 2013-09-14 15:38:50
That sounds like a really cool idea. Have there been many instances of successful crowdfunded bitcoin projects in the past? 
@_date: 2013-09-14 15:46:45
thanks! glad you liked it.

My first full-length album will drop for Bitcoins, Litecoins, and USD. More information and a website are in the future (if you guys want it, that is!)
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:17:51
Hi! I am thinking about crowdsourcing with your platform. Can you pm me some recommendations and your thoughts on "what works"? Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:55:31
Tell me about it! I made a lot of bitcoins with my music, no label, no hands in my pocket, no advances. I earned it all by marketing myself and putting myself out there in clever ways and it paid off big. And not a soul understands but me.
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:50:58
IIRC it was something like 20%. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:14:27
I wish :) unfortunately, as much as I wanted to keep it around, life got the best of my coffers.
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:15:54
No worries. You will have more chances to tell me to shut up and take your money :)

It was [released via coindl]( Donations were collected over about a 1-2 year period from posting releases on reddit and bitcointalk/bitcoin wiki.
@_date: 2013-09-15 07:43:28
No lack of effort on my part I assure you :)
As for whether people will want it, I guess that is up to everyone. I haven't released my album yet truthfully because I don't think it's ready. I don't want to just slap 30minutes of just anything I've produced into an album and give anyone that. I need to make sure whatever I put out is really solid, whether it catches on or not will (hopefully) be a product of how good it is.
@_date: 2013-09-14 08:32:11
Good question. I guess my thinking was, they've broken the frontpage here a number of times since the boom and all the attention it attracted, and they're mainstream enough that I decided it would be a tough act to follow until I had a lot more material put together. I think they are awesome artists and I have nothing but respect for their works.

I'm not at all ashamed of how many coins I've spent on pizzaforcoins.
