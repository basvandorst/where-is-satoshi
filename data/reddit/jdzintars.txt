For Bitcoin, the amount of coins issued via mining does decrease over time...currently It's 12.5 bitcoin per block which is forecasted to continue until around 2020 ( and then it will halve. Other coins may operate differently. It has nothing to do with the value of the coin, but the quantity available according to the algorithm rules.
To see whether mining is worth it, you can check out mining calculators:

You can also checkout coinsquare.io. They hace a higher max than coinbase and you can coknect to canadian banks. I have been successfully buying small amounts from coinbase.

Like others have suggested, if you're hoping to set up a mining rig in your garage, that would be like hoping to strike it rich  panning for gold in a river beside a huge factory drilling for gold in solid rock.

Good Point.

Exactly. Bitcoin is a public Blockchain that records every transaction made and because everyone is in agreement about the transactions occurring it is impossible to change.
I don't know all the details about quantum computing, but there is also quantum cryptography that is currently being developed and in use in some cases that uses quantum computing principles for cryptography. Bitcoin isn't the only thing vulnerable to quantum computing. The security of the entire internet would be undermined since all hashing/encryption/public and private key algoritjms rely on brute force resources to prevent cracking.

The Blockchain is a peer-to-peer model that is a bit different than a website or client server model.
The source code is written by numerous people and is freely available at  Anyone can run programs that are built from this source code, including you.
All programs that are running (called nodes) talk to each other on the network and share the state of the Blockchain. As the Blockchain grows through mining nodes, every node on the network updates itself so it's own local copy of the Blockchain matches what other nodes have. So the entire network of nodes around the world are all more or less in sync over time.
There is no one central authority, it is simply the consensus of many of the nodes on the network agreeing to the state of the Blockchain according to the longest chain over time.

The wallet is used to generate the private/public keys and manage all of the keys/addresses. The public key is generated from your private key and turned into a public address through a process of double hashing and base58 encoding. That address if you wrote it down could be used to sending/receiving bitcoin. However the private keys are required to access the address since the private keys were used to generate the public keys. Without the private keys you cannot access the public addresses generated from those keys. So without the wallet managing that would be pretty cumbersome. That's what wallets are for - managing your addresses. 
You can always use a public address with any service to send/receive bitcoin at that address.

That random string is an address. If you get a bitcoin wallet, you may be able to receive the amount at that address to your own address.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:06:31
Exactly. Your wallet will track addresses, almost like mailboxes. You can have some amount of bitcoin at these addresses, and the transactions that led to that address having that amount of bitcoin are all recorded on the Blockchain. So if all the nodes have the block with your transaction in it, that is your bitcoin because only you can access that address.

That's a good point...gaining $150 / mth in BTC adds up over the year and if electricity is cheap and usage subsidised by the utility company then that can work.

Online exchanges often work in two steps. They have their own wallet that they provide you that generates addresses that the bitcoin will be transferred to. So, when you purchase bitcoin, they transfer the bitcoin to the address generated by their wallet, which is associated with your account. So when you log into the exchange you see all of the bitcoin you have with them.
If you want to transfer the bitcoin out of their wallet to addresses that you personally control, you would use your own wallet software to generate an address and send the bitcoin from the online wallet address to your personal address. Now you don't need to access the online exchange to access your bitcoin. 
It's sort of like withdrawing money from a bank account and putting it into your wallet or a safe.
The bank puts money into your account, and then you take it out of the account.

It's how you move/use bitcoin. If you wanted you spend bitcoin for an online transaction, you would have to transfer the bitcoin from your online exchange wallet address to the person's/Online store's provided receiving address.
Many people recommend moving bitcoin off of the exchanges to a personal wallet for security. In that case, the address you are transferring to is your own. If the exchange gets hacked the addresses are vulnerable to the hackers transferring bitcoin to other addresses and stealing the bitcoin. Keeping your own wallet means you have to make sure that you keep your keys/passwords safe yourself. As long as no one else has your keys, no one can steal your bitcoin. The risk is if you lost your keys or forgot your password for your wallet, you would lose your bitcoin. Kinda like digitally losing cash.

It's a race. Every miner is trying to solve a math problem that computationally takes about 10 minutes to solve on average. The first miner to solve the problem and tell the network wins and is given btc.

If someone gets into your wallet, then they can do whatever they want, so you need to keep your password secure. The device itself is designed so that the private keys can't be accessed on the device so it is basically "unhackable" as long as someone doesn't have the password to your wallet or pin for your device.
The Blockchain itself can't be hacked per se, so someone would need the private keys on your device to access those addresses. Since your device is not on the internet, the keys only exist on that device which is secured by a pin and encrypted. Only someone who had your pin could access your device and get the keys.
It's kinda like having money in your wallet in your pocket. No one can steal your money unless they can steal your wallet. But if your money is in the bank, someone could rob the bank.

That's why many people transfer their money off of coinbase into their own wallets. If anything happens to coinbase their coins can't be touched because they aren't there. Same justification holds for if coinbase got hacked and the private keys got stolen. 
Coinbase is an exchange and only an entry/exit point for bitcoin/fiat. Leaving your coins there has the advantage that you don't have to worry about losing your private keys, but has the disadvantage of your coins being in a central location with a single company. Like having all your money with a bank. In some ways it's safer than storing money in a personal safe, but not as private.
There is also a loss of anonymity since once you have registered and transferred money/coins to and from there, your registered info is tied to those transactions which can be traced and as you mentioned could probably be subpoenaed which would provide a record of your personal bitcoin activity.

Miners create the blocks. One miner wins the block, and every miner goes back to mining the next block to win the next available bitcoin. Almost all mining is done by mining pools...You can see who is creating the blocks at blockchain.info/pools

Ah, sorry was thinking a flat fee. Does the monthly return cover the initial investment and electricity, or are you hoping that as the value of BTC rises you can recoup costs and profit in the in the future?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:56:26
Mining is dominated by massive server farms and mining pools that people have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in. It's very unlikely that as an individual you will mine any blocks and make any profit for your expenses, it that's what you are thinking. You may be able to join a mining pool and make a small percentage through that.

Missed the part about your concerns re: coinbase. I haven't had any problems myself and have been using for 6 months. Just set up a friend of mine this week and they had no problems and bought their first bitcoin within minutes.

There is a BTM at a Waves coffee in downtown Vancouver. It was installed in 2013 and apparently has claim to the first BTM in the world.
I haven't used it myself, but I have friends who have and several people I know who have been in bitcoin since the beginning have recommended that BTM as an easy way to get started if you are in the area.
Aside from that, you can use an exchange like coinbase to buy bitcoin from an online exchange. It's really easy once you're set up and I haven't experienced any problems myself. There is also a Canadian exchange called coinsquare.io that I haven't tried yet but could also be another option.
