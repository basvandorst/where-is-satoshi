Thanks so much for watching! Amazing how low key some of the people in the white paper are
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:49:04
Yeah that was my favorite line too :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:48:11
Thanks for watching! He was a completely lovely guy :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:49:56
It's exciting what power structures might become decentralized over the next decade!
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:22:07
lol :) I appreciate your support :) And will be sure to say both moon and lambo in the next one...
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:13:11
haha I really appreciate that :) I'm really glad you liked the interview! Let me know if you ever have any suggestions for content to cover or people to interview :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:47:25
I really appreciate that :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:22:34
I'm glad you (kind of) liked it :)
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:53:54
I agree with you! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:32:10
I agree, he's great
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:33:33
Thank you so much for saying so! I really appreciate that!!
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:25:51
lol the video isn't about uncovering Satoshi :)
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:21:31
Thank you :) :)
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:40:36
On the weekly crypto recap today we talk about NY's relentless pursuit of Kraken, recent SEC activity regarding ethereum and ETFs and the lack of clarity from government, the bitcoin bug, and a heap of other topics! 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:29:54
He was really great, the nicest guy and so incredibly smart
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:01:41
Thanks so much for saying so :) Glad you liked the interview, he really was wonderful to talk to!
@_date: 2018-09-02 18:33:40
lol :)  
And yay for making it into the playlist at the bottom...
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:49:19
Thanks for watching, I appreciate the support!
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:48:47
haha yeah that's pretty awesome :) They have no idea how lucky they are!
@_date: 2018-09-15 02:09:50
This is absolutely incorrect.
1) There are blockchain platforms with inbuilt mechanisms to earmark funds for distribution. You no longer have to give your own money -- there's less friction when people are just upvoting something rather than parting with their actual monty.
2) decentralized currency means you don't have to ask for permission to support certain projects they way you used to (donations to certain things historically banned by governments, but they no longer have the power to do so)
3) To invest in a film you need to work within a very bureaucratic system. For crypto you don't.

Goddamn it does. I watched that so many times and didn't see till now :(
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:44:42
You know how when you click "post a link" and it doesn't allow you to write anything other than the url for your post? I guess people don't like that, huh...
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:39:14
Thanks so much :)
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:36:07
lol :)
@_date: 2018-08-27 23:59:44
You mean like "OMG you wouldn't believe these facts about bitcoin!"? :)  
This is just a starter video to introduce people to bitcoin. No offense taken if you don't watch it, just spreading the word :)
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:41:15
Much appreciated!!
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:38:56
Yeah it tends to be synonymous especially with people unacquainted with the tech
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:29:02
Thank you so much :)
@_date: 2018-08-20 04:28:02
Thanks for watching! No not at all, he was really nice
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:40:41
Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:35:04
Thank you! I try to keep things as friendly as possible, confrontational may get more views, but I find that being combative isn't usually the best way to win people over to new ideas
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:38:03

I appreciate that! I have a "50 facts about bitcoin" video coming out this week which may be helpful also
@_date: 2018-08-27 23:29:40
It was submitted as just a link not a post :) But the summary is on the youtube posting

Well that's why Tim Draper is doing what he's doing: "we want to enable people to hold and trade Bitcoin to secure themselves against weakening currencies.”
Everyone is looking at places like Argentina for the inflation, but I agree that we could to have a very real problem here soon
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:37:32
Thank you! I have been trying to work on that. Just don't look at some of the earlier interviews on my channel circa 2013 ;)
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:50:05
Thanks for watching :)
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:34:46
No I made the video and hired myself :)
I'm a contributor for Reason TV, on the advisory council for the Mannkal foundation for Economic Education, Program officer at the Moving Picture Institute, host an economics reading group in NYC with the economics editor of Barron's, and in my spare time I make videos.
I agree, totally cringeworthy, but probably the most fun I've had making a video :)
Although the worst part of it all was having to buy that Bernanke book as a prop...
@_date: 2018-08-20 05:40:48

@_date: 2014-06-27 20:55:02
Thanks for letting me know about this! They contacted me a while ago asking if they could link to my videos, which I didn't see the harm in, but apparently it seems I'm the only real person on the site! *eep
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:29:32
Glad to hear!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:13:13
So I just heard back from the website developer, she is taking my information off the site. It seems like she doesn't have too many details about what's going on, she only seemed to have been involved in the website design and was glad I brought her attention to this thread.
@_date: 2014-08-26 04:49:07
In light of the impending bitlicense, do you think it's worthwhile making a video to teach people what the pros of storing coins in cold/paper wallets etc might be, if any, or perhaps creating anonymous wallets and putting coins through mixers? I'd love to interview people who know more about this than I do, to help people who might be in the same boat as me.
@_date: 2014-08-30 00:42:22
Best of luck with it, Charlie. You have a lot of people sending you their love and support, let's catch up soon
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:39:43
Let's get zhou tonged involved!
@_date: 2014-08-26 06:17:54
Users. 
I'd love to interview someone who could talk a less tech-savvy person through those things, any suggestions for someone based in NYC?
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:35:04
I've had a few people contact me for more information about what's going on, but unfortunately don't have much to provide!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:15:13
Just via email. There's another site that asked to push some of my stuff, and they seem pretty legit so far, seems like a good group. This one, however...
@_date: 2014-08-30 06:38:58
It just means you need to apply for a press pass, they need to recognise you as an accredited member of the press
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:14:24
New York isn't going to remain the financial capital of the world for long if it stays this hostile to bitcoin. The idea that they've found a happy balance of innovation with consumer protection is a joke. As Erik Voorhees says in his fantastic article, the proposed bitlicense has nothing to do with consumer protection. If the NYDFS were interested in this, they wouldn't have just opened 350 million americans/6 billion global citizens up to the risk of identity fraud by perverting a system designed to respect a person's privacy and protect them from this very thing.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:31:22
I added a comment on my fb page also
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:05:40
I'd be down for that :)
Actually my next project is Bitcoin the comic, where bitcoin girl fights the  federal reserve...

I reeeeeally terrible mic haha :)
Am working on fixing it in future episodes. Everyone should feel free to donate to the "Help Naomi buy better audio equipment" fund ;)

This wound is still a little raw for me...
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:37:56
Actually that's precisely why money that holds its value is far more desirable than money which doesn't. People want to get rid of the money which they believe will buy them less goods in the future, and that's why so many people invest in gold in times of economic uncertainty. Because it's more desirable than holding onto their dollars.
Also, an inflationary currency does force people to spend it, but consumption for the sake of consumption isn't necessarily desirable.  That's a perversion of Say's Law in economics. Saving is very desirable because that's where investment capital comes from, and people are less likely to save (and therefore have the means for investment) if what they're holding onto is losing value the longer they hold it. It's inflationary currency that actually decreases investment.

@_date: 2014-07-15 17:15:01
Yeah I totally get your point. It was more symbolic than anything.
I have a casascius coin which I wanted to use really just as a hat-tip to Mike Caldwell (but you couldn't really tell what it was on camera), but mainly having a physical coin just looked better for video.
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:10:43
That's really interesting that he sort of fell into Bitcoin. I'm glad that he's now running with it and exploring things like counterparty
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:28:28
Completely agree. UK finance minister has already announced that he wants to make London the FinTech capital of the world and provide the right regulatory framework to encourage bitcoin-related companies to move there. If NY State wants to keep these people, they'll have to change their attitude.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:40:52
Thanks for watching!
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:41:44
Say no to intermediaries!
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:31:04
I could look at this all day.
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:00:21
Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:24:09
If bitcoin is the future, which makes sense in a digital age, then I'm not sure that New York is going to be holding onto the title "financial capital of the world" for much longer...
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:17:54
haha thanks, Charlie!
@_date: 2014-08-30 00:46:30
It's so ridiculous. "Illegal for everyone... except if you were already a large compliant bank"
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:31:03
Sure, I'd love to show people some of the products that are out there. Send me your email and I'll get in touch, thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-20 06:35:04
you betchya
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:07:32
I just got in touch with the two people who contacted me from the site to see if they have some sort of explanation. Thanks for the heads up!
The interviews in Toronto weren't for anyone in particular, just my own interest :) I freelance as a contributor for Reason.TV and am a policy associate at the bitcoin center, and work on a bunch of bitcoin related projects with the Moving Picture Institute.
Will be in touch once I hear from them!
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:12:40
not a paywall, it's free. They just want your email address

How so? Some laws are bad and harmful to people. Would you have had Harriet Tubman just obey the law? Do you think the war on drugs is a good thing?
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:52:12
Thanks for posting, and thanks for the kind words everyone! I just put a new video on my channel if anyone is interested :)

@_date: 2017-09-10 21:28:26
lolol I wish I had time and budget to make more ridiculous videos :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:18:24
You're lovely! Alright I'll create a patreon account just for that dollar!
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:53:29
I feel like Taylor Swift really hasn't catered for that huge market that wants love songs about breaking up with govt fiat, so I'm picking up the slack.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:53:42
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:21:46
Granted it's a very different style to her other albums. I didn't like it as much as first, but after listening to it on repeat while editing this video, I'm actually kind of obsessed with it now...
Also she seems to be in her prime right now, she's broken lots of records with this release: Most views in 24 hrs, fastest song to  on iTunes, fastest song to reach 200 million views. Never underestimate the power of the Swiftie army! :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:44:44
The video's great, hey!
And there is NOTHING terrible about a tub filled with diamonds lol :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:11:21
Ok I launched a Patreon today lol :) 0 patrons so far, I'll see if others are as interested as you in more videos :) 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:51:51
Watch it! It's one of my favorite music videos, especially the end
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:52:11
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:41:31
I'll try! Let's see if anyone wants to donate to ridiculous music videos though :)
@_date: 2015-11-06 03:02:51

@_date: 2015-11-30 13:00:00

@_date: 2015-11-30 13:01:15
subtitles are optional on the video, you can turn them on now, they've been added :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:42:38

Not gone yet, now on ReasonTV, new episodes released soon!
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:35:34
"I would have had sympathy for him if he hadn't tried to kill someone". It's like you people have never heard of a smear campaign. Can you imagine the support he would have received if there was no doubt about his character? If everyone just thought he was a guy who created a website and tried to make the world a safer place through peaceful trade? All of the smears against his character come from alleged crimes he was never actually charged with.
