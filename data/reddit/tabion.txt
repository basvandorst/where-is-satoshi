Blanket statement for justifying being an asshole. If you were so immune to not being offended yourself, then you would’ve expressed supportive behaviour instead of the shitty hypocritical one you’re doing right now.

Don’t worry about the short term, BTC is here to stay. Lots of FUD because of futures, but look at the long term. Most powerful crypto on earth, lightning network will be online soon, futures will stabilize the currency. People are selling because they want to wait and see, which is fair. I’m holding with what I’m willing to lose, but if I went all in, I would not sell right now because at some point it will skyrocket as much as it dips. Honestly, you won’t think about it when it starts moving up. It will be a true test to your human psychology. Numbers feel nothing. Cheers and best of luck.

Ocean Dub was my favourite version of the English dub. Vegeta sounded truly evil and you could really connect with the characters in this early series.

Because of this story, I am going to buy MORE bitcoin! I'm holding hard to keep this currency stable. This is the true reason being why we need a decentralized currency versus our government printing out money. Best wishes for your continued efforts!

Which is an IOU? You cache a transaction to be settled later. It’s crazy how pedantic people are on this subreddit.

I'm sure you don't need to know double speak to be part of Bitcoin. That's just mixing irrelevant information together.

You know, people like you thinking bitcoin is power to the people have no idea that eventually it will just become another currency. A few people at the top will own the majority of the bitcoins. It’s going to be the same shit. And a few people will enjoy the gains before it stabilizes. That is all. Your V for Vendetta is dead, focus on yourself instead of some activism bullcrap.

While that is true, there is a correlation with past performance and future. Banks put down past performance do not indicate future success to cover their ass. The whole field of statistical and regression analysis exists because of past performance. I would advise educating yourself in that, versus thinking that it has only one answer. It’s a multi varied reason for why the prices move up and down.

It’s risk management, people who are able to bare higher risk will be rewarded a lot more. Condescending comments like that are also not productive.
