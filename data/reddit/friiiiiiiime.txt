Thanks for this epic post! I have three questions on this:
1) Do we have to use FIFO? That's going to be super complicated and hard to figure out if so.
2) For exchanges that don't have USD, when exchanging crypto for crypto, where do we source the equivalent USD value of each crypto at time of sale? 
3) What should we do in instances where we don't have records? I know that for a couple of trades, I used an exchange that I don't have login credentials for anymore, and for a couple of trades I used Shapeshift—and don't have the records from there either.

I did some googling on this, and read way too many reports of them getting accessed by either thieves or the gov't, or getting destroyed due to fire/flood/other. Sure, it's a small chance, as is my friend's house getting broken into or my house catching fire - but these things happen. Hence the need to be smart about how we're storing our seeds. Would you, for example, trust a piece of paper with your complete seed, stored in a safe deposit box at the bank - as your sole backup?

Lol. solid.

In my post, I mention safe deposit boxes. They're not very safe. They get broken into a lot, the bank/the gov't go into them a lot, and they're vulnerable to fire/flood, etc. So not the best solution as the sole copy of one's seed. Especially if that seed is stored as plain text.

Cool, thank you!

Good points! I think I'm going to go with storing an incomplete paper seed and complete but encrypted USB at the bank, and the same at another location (with the remaining part of the paper seed, plus complete/encrypted USB).

Is your full key, for your entire wallet (and entire crypto savings) stored in plain text on the cryptosteel? 
How many copies of the cryptosteel do you have?
How many keys for each? 
Where do you store all of this?
Also, a cryptosteel isn't impenetrable. Padlocks can be defeated either with lock picks, hand tools (chain cutters), portable power tools, or corded power tools.

What method do you recommend for scrambling the seed words, and is the passphrase the thing that unscrambles them? How do I do this?

Can you go into more detail?
