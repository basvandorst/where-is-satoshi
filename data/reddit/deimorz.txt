Bitcoin purchases typically represent a very small portion of the gold sales. [I posted some stats here related to this same sale last year]( and somewhere in the 3-5% range is probably still pretty accurate.

In rare cases, a post just fails to get added to the "new" and/or "hot" listings. If you remove and then re-approve it, it should force it to be re-added, and then should show up.

To be clear, you shouldn't take that comment as me saying that we'll never have 2FA. I'm quite sure that we will get it implemented eventually. It was meant to be an explanation of why it's *difficult* to add 2FA, it's not just a switch we can flip.

Thanks! Make sure you check out [the about page]( and the new options available at the bottom of the [preferences page]( to see the new stuff available as a gold member.

Hmm, had one of the admins told you that they were going to make a post about it here? This is the first I'm hearing about something like that, but I wasn't hugely involved in it.
I don't think it was too big of a problem to have the post about it go up later though, since we actually did run the sale for quite a while after Black Friday. We didn't actually turn it off until Sunday, and the purchases had definitely gone back to a fairly normal rate by then.

The API restriction is to not do more than one request every 2 seconds, so it could easily be sped up to hit things in less than 30 seconds or so. He just most likely has his instance set up to only check every 30 minutes or something.

Ah, yeah, yishan had rounded to full percentage points on his last one.
Going back to the data he used for that, it looks like the Bitcoin percentages from Feb 17 forward were actually 1.99% and 3.13%, so they weren't rounded very much. So yes, proportionally the number of BTC transactions is actually up a pretty good chunk, though the revenue % hasn't changed very much.

I don't know why they'd say that, it's definitely not the case. You can check the comments is posting when it removes things and compare the post times on them against the post time of the thread. [Here's the most recent one at the time of me posting]( - 8 seconds after submission.
The only exception is that it only checks reported items every 10 minutes, but in terms of checking new comments/submissions it's almost immediate.


Another option you might consider then is something like removing anything where the domain is less than 10 chars and the whole url is less than 20 characters or so? That should hit shortners but not many legitimate urls.


I think he overestimates the amount of effort they'd go to, but in the end, just about any approach you come up with is going to have the chance of removing legitimate posts too. But sometimes it's a lot easier to err on the side of removing things that are almost always spam and just manually reapprove the cases where it was a false positive.

Why is your AutoMod instance so slow to react? The main one (under hits things in about 10 seconds.
There are various ways you could protect against spam like this without needing to target the domains or users specifically. One possibility might be auto-spamming everything made by an account that's less than a day old or has less than 5 link karma or less than 10 comment karma or something. Very low thresholds for legitimate users to get over, but difficult for spammers.

It's something we've talked about and considered, but there were a few issues with it that we needed to get figured out before it might be a feasible option (higher fees with most payment processors, etc.). It's definitely still something I'd like to do eventually, because I agree that $1 is a much more reasonable "impulse" point for gilding people than $4 is.
However, one thing you can do now if you like to give gold fairly often is [buy a year's worth of "creddits"]( instead of getting 1 month at a time. That way gilding a comment with a month of gold is only $2.50 instead of the full $4 each time.

That's correct, if the gold goal is hit for the day, all of the people that contributed towards the goal by buying gold that day (either for themselves or gifted to others) are able to suggest and vote on the other suggestions in @_date: 2013-12-07 03:07:28
I don't think I understand (and I know how bitcointip works). What are you picturing that would do when someone used it?
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:55:36
I feel really weird about people thanking me for reminding them to give us money. I also feel really weird about the number of pronouns in that sentence.
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:26:53
No, fees aren't factored into this. The revenue percentage being so much higher mostly shows that Bitcoin purchases were, on average, much larger purchases (multiple months or years).

One thing about gold that's kind of difficult is that we don't actually *want* it to be "so great". We never want to be in a situation where the experience as a gold user is far superior to that of a non-gold user, because then we're basically making it so that you have to pay in order to get the "full" reddit experience. So we try to add things that are small benefits and nice to have, but people don't particularly feel upset about not having access to either. If something's really useful for everyone (and it's not excessively taxing on the servers), we want to add it as a feature for everyone, not just the gold users.
So it's a tough balancing act, trying to find the place where people are happy to have gold, but don't feel like they *need* to have it either.

Hmm, I'll take a look. I don't think there's any reason it should work differently for Bitcoin than the other methods.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:52:32
Well, I've made 0.006 BTC in tips so far. Does that count?
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:49:15
No, thank *you* for the support, we definitely appreciate it!

I'm planning to make a post to later this week with some info about the result from our Bitcoin Black Friday sale on reddit gold and comparing that to regular days. So you should have some more info like that in the next few days.
I don't know if things have changed in the last few months, but [as yishan's said]( previously the additional accounting overhead and such that was added by accepting bitcoin here was more than the actual revenue we were making from them.
