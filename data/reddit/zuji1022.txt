Hey most of our revenue is in fiat and we pay those expenses in Fiat.  
A much smaller portion of our revenue is in BTC.  We look to first pay all expenses in BTC if possible
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:15:48
What do you think the right percentage is?
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:47:29
Sweet glad to hear it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:29:14
Sounds like a really intense experience, but one you must have learned loads in the process.  Glad you survived through it!
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:08:08
Good point. I updated my bio on the page.  I used to work as analyst at a hedge fund and am a CFA charterholder
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:36:13
Does anyone think Bitcoin will eventually be the national currency of a country?  (i.e. Argentina or Ukraine)  
It sounds strange, but countries like Panama and Ecuador actually use the US Dollar as their national currency
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:32:13
Thanks and appreciate the support!  I wonder if in a few years we'll be looking back, and have trouble believing we had to go to such lengths to accept Bitcoin!  
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:29:42
I'd take a look at coinbase.com or circle.com to purchase some.  Circle is better since you get instant access to your coins up to a certain dollar limit
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:12:40
I heard makes your feet a lot stronger, since actually have to rely on all the muscles in them for balance/coordination instead of just relying on the shoe

For 1 books, its $6.95 for shipping to Germany.  For two books, its $12.95 to Germany!

I know it.  The guys at Xcubicle did a great helping to get it setup
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:42:17
Hi zjbirdwork! We are a young company (launched in March) and the Confidant notebook is our first product!
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:11:53
Its certainly something we'll take a look at.  Its amazing how far ahead Shopify was compared to some other online platforms!
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:30:42
We'd love to accept Bitcoin and make it a super smooth process.  NYC Bitcoin Fair was great experience for us and showed all the support of the Bitcoin community
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:21:08
Total agreement.

Nice.  Take a little tip with it!  17.88 bits @_date: 2014-11-03 18:24:31
My pleasure :)
1 internets @_date: 2014-09-18 20:31:11
Appreciate it!  Want to do everything we can to make shipping cheaper for our neighbors up north!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:27:20
Thats one part I'm not entirely clear about either.  And I should clarify, i'm planning to use ApplePay for in person transactions (Starbucks, Walgreens, etc)
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:51:04
We feel really strongly about holding our coins.  Thats our way of supporting the ecosystem.  If we just sold, then doesn't nearly help Bitcoin as much.
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:43:10
Hey you can check out the site at

I've had good experience in the past with Toastmasters.  Its a club based format, effective, and much cheaper than some other options.
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:18:33
Even better if its working.  Then there will be more places you can pay with it
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:46:26
Everyone has their own risk tolerance.  Like Icic_ thats going all in
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:00:33
Thats some amazing generosity and much appreciated!

The paper is 100gsm with an ever so slight tooth to it.  We found in our experience it works quite well with fountain pens.  But you might check out Fountain Pen Geeks in-depth review for more clarity

Thanks we're always looking at new countries to expand into.  Will keep Norway in mind for the future!

Hey guys its Adam, co-founder of Baron Fig here.  Thanks for the nice words!  We love bitcoin and happy to do everything we can to support the ecosystem
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:50:48
Fantastic!  I just sent you an email to follow up!
@_date: 2014-11-07 23:35:49
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:42:02
Awesome you guys are moving forward.  Looking forward to testing the system out
@_date: 2014-09-16 23:49:44
Is there a hodl logo now?
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:28:49
Adam thanks much!  We've been working hard to improve our Bitcoin integration!
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:31:28
Love it.  We are doing some hodling over here!
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:32:08
Thanks we hope so!  We're huge fans of Bitcoin and its very important to us that we can accept it seamlessly with our ecommerce platform!
@_date: 2014-09-17 09:35:11
Thanks much Robert!
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:01:58
Thanks so much for all the kind words!  Appreciate all the support, even if we can do just a bit for Bitcoin (nice wording right), then makes the whole ecosystem even better.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:55:54
This is a good idea for solid application of bitcoin.  Would likely face resistance from auction houses since their business thrives based on selling authentic wines based on their reputation
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:57:18
Hey thats something we'll definitely look into supporting in the future!
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:28:06
Corrected. Thanks for the point out
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:51:14
I'm not sure why they would.  I sent money over PayPal this week, there was a 4.5% fee.  With Bitcoin it would have been a virtually 0 fee.  PayPal lives on fees.
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:02:14
Awesome thanks Josh!  Something just feels so good when using BTC (imo!)
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:45:13
Hey its Co-Founder Adam here from Baron Fig.  We had an amazing time at the NYC Bitcoin Fair on Sunday and I loved meeting a whole bunch of you that came in from out of town.
It was the first time we accepted Bitcoin and was the best experience.  We setup a workaround using Coinbase for our website and would love a better workflow using Squarespace directly. Thanks everyone for your support!
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:14:01
Its a good strategy
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:00:34
I would also think Walmart's credit card processing fees are the lowest of almost anyone on the planet.  I'm sure they have negotiated deals that are way less than almost anyone else already
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:26:16
We're with you on that.  But give it some time, and I think other people will start to learn there is some power in the BTC!
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:49:10
Hi its Adam, feel free to ask us any questions!  We're happy to offer advice or help wherever we can
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:13:44
Very cool!
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:56:09
Get out there and go for it
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:24:36
Sweet enjoy it!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:22:32
Indeed.  But Apple is famous for getting people to change behavior.  There were MP3 players before the iPod and smartphones before the iPhone, but those two really drove major adoption imo.
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:14:35
Abosolutely, I think you're right on.  There are many functions people play in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and holding/store of value is an extremely important one for it all to thrive!
@_date: 2014-09-17 09:34:59
Awesome appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:36:16
Awesome thanks much!  Hope she enjoys using it!
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:27:08
Sweetness, enjoy the Apprentices!  They are pocket friendly, so sometimes its easy to forget you're actually carrying it!
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:14:13
Exactly love it
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:53:22
Nice.  We're here and happy to help
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:12:04
So far its a good start, and glad we do our little bit to support the ecosystem!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:42:53
Right good point.  I kept thinking its on launch date, but its not until October.  Either way, its only a few weeks away
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:03:24
Awesome thanks so much!  We're really surprised as well that Squarespace didn't jump on Bitcoin faster.  With Shopify and others accepting it, would make their platform so much better!
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:17:46
It seems much simpler.  
a) put it near the reader
b) put your fingerprint on it
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:24:28
Thanks, we're indeed selling paper notebooks!  Hope you enjoy them.  One of our best specs- battery lasts all day and great contrast in the sunlight :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:56:24
This would be fantastic.  Like the thinking OP
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:50:06
Totally.  And for most its not 1%.  2-3% + .30 or so per transaction makes up to a huge percentage for lower dollar volume transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:12:02
Nice!  I know some people are going that far.  Wonder who all is going to accept Bitcoin in 2014
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:54:52
I've had the best luck accepting through Coinbase
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:06:03
Glad to hear it, enjoy it!
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:50:19
Yeah tell everyone that
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:37:02
Great!  Thanks for the support (and supporting Bitcoin)!
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:28:34
Hey taurenkc, we'd love to show the wallet and intraday activity.  BitPay batches all the activity and sends it at days end.  They do they this by processing through several of their own wallets in the mean time.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:39:45
Awesome thanks!  Enjoy them!
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:05:12
Yeah Coinbase is good.  I'm curious what happens to the 1% fee. Wonder where that ends up in time
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:51:37
Hey nickm717!  Thanks for the second order. Really appreciate it and for the good words!
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:04:57
Sweetness thanks for the list. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:46:12
Yeah for sure.  Here's the Blockchain.info link to our wallet.  Keep in mind, BitPay batches all our payments to send at the end of the night.  So there isn't activity in there for today for orders.
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:31:56
Totally.  I go into Walgreens and its there with the little Google Wallet sticker on the checkout.  But I haven't seen anyone really use it.  Now that Apple is putting it in style, we have a chance for non-swiping payments to start occurring
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:00:49
I think will take people really focusing on saving money, and things like discounts at many retailers to get the much more budget conscious to save a few % here and there to start adopting.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:45:32
You win BTC or pay to play?
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:05:31
This is a good call OP.  If there's any easy way to gift bitcoins, that could prove popular
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:32:33
Thanks so much for the good words jageoffroy!
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:17:43
Thanks for the good comments on the books!  We set the verification time to as quick as BitPay will allow, so 6-7 minutes is about right.  Not sure if BitPay does something different than Coinbase or other payment processors.  Maybe someone else on here has a good insight into it.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:13:49
Definitely.  First it helps us cut out credit card fees/credit card companies.  Then best part are all the people we met.  There are loads of good Bitcoin supporters both in NYC and around the world that we've come in touch with.   
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:29:48
Hey very interesting!  We'll check it out and maybe get a game of Go started along the way!
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:11:51
Hey smartfbrankings, biggest problem I immediately see is likely due to suppliers accepting Bitcoin.  For us, there can be a lot of bank fees transferring money to places we order from.  
We would need some sort of control panel for all of our suppliers with their addresses stored to send regular payments.  Also having a history of supplier payments tied into our accounting system would be very helpful.
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:57:58
Easybitz thanks for stopping by!  Can't wait to see what you guys are coming out with 
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:49:21
We'll find out if people use it or not.  I think the difference is that now, its cool to use it.
And if you're right and there's massive blowback due to slavery, thats even better.  Since then Bitcoin is right there which is a neutral solution.  Customers will be used to using wireless and merchants will have the infrastructure.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:01:07
We're in Long Island City.  If you're ever around, come stop by the studio!
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:08:41
Thanks Nick!  We came out with the 3 Legged Juggler limited edition Confidant on Friday.  We also released the Lightbulb Apprentice which is a purple pocket notebook!
@_date: 2014-09-11 19:43:58
With the average wire transfer somewhere around $25-35, makes a ton of sense to use bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:38:21
Good question.  For us its something we really like for a large number of reasons.  
1. Only 21 million will be created
2. Much lower transaction fees
3. Very simple sending money around the world
4. Everyone is free to use it
I posted much more details a few months back on a thread "You Should Have 5% of Your Portfolio in Bitcoin"
So this is our little way of supporting something we like

Hey Nick, thanks for posting up all the advice.  Think life gets busy at times, and people overestimate the ability of their memory to recollect the past.  Frequently it becomes far more hazy, more quickly than people expect.  Good advice where we all need to take more careful consideration!
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:25:00

@_date: 2014-09-16 17:59:49
Appreciate it, thanks much!  Its an interesting adventure in this new and developing financial world.  Glad to explore it with everyone on @_date: 2014-09-16 14:32:42
Actually we've started asking our suppliers if they will accept it.  A number have been hearing it from other customers as well.  Hopefully over time more suppliers will start being interested and accepting it.
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:31:50
Sweetness!  Thanks for adding us up to spendabit.co
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:16:53
Thanks its something we're taking a look at!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:33:57
As I would imagine.  But I could also see over time that if enough people are asking for it, Walmart will negotiate a lower cut for Apple or something.  From .15% to .05%. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:51:07
Great pics from a nice day at the fair
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:02:28
Thats odd couldn't do it in person.  The Malaysian/Thai food vendor Mamak had their Bitpay account setup and loved it.  I'll be back to order some curry on rice again with Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:05:58
I would have thought it would kill your feet and/or legs, but maybe I should give them a shot.  Does it hurt if you step on a stone or something on the ground?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:54:44
Nice!  What service do you use to cash out?
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:38:05
I haven't actually gone through the process since I don't have Xbox yet.  But I imagine it works something like
1. Buy Bitcoin on coinbase.com or circle.com.  Once you get it
2. Send it to your xbox account
Sounds like you have it about right.  Try using circle though, you'll get it immediately.  With coinbase you have to wait 4 days
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:36:03
Sweet glad it was a good experience.  We tried a lot of Bitcoin checkout software and found that Coinbase was very smooth and a nice experience.  Hope you enjoy your books!
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:07:54
We posted our wallet link on the last post 
We hold some coins in our Coinbase wallet when receiving from purchases and in case we can use them for business expenses.  Then we periodically make transfers to the wallet address above.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:15:06
Good find.  I suppose they wanted to make sure it cleared
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:36:19
I tried the $10.  Wasn't sure if that was a flat ACH fee or a % fee.  Either way its a good step in the right direction.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:49:02
Alex - Adam here from Baron Fig.  Glad you got your books!  Enjoy the holidays!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:29:52
True to that.  But point is, nobody is really using Bitcoin in person right now.  Its cumbersome I've found for non-technies scanning QR codes.
We were a merchant at the NYC Bitcoin Fair this summer.  Lots of Bitcoin fans showed up to buy our books, but it was a huge hassle for all of us to use QR codes.  I didn't realize it until then, that Bitcoin really needs a better in person transaction method.  And I think it turns out that Apple is the one helping to drive that
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:53:23
Thats crazy.  I did a half marathon once and thought I almost Satoshi himself
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:03:50
We believe really strongly in holding them.  We've been asking our various suppliers to accept Bitcoin and soon enough hope to start using them to pay for various expenses
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:37:25
Agreed.  You might want to wait, see if you get a shot at selling them at 400 instead!
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:49:00
Loving it!  All the vendors were psyched for bitcoin.  Now I just have to grab some of their food!
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:43:39
Its not an insignificant portion of merchant revenue that goes to credit card fees.  You might just get your wish 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:10:55
Agreed.  Always have to look whats coming next
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:32:20
Nice thanks @_date: 2014-09-16 18:41:29
Awesome glad it worked for you!  We've done some reading about OpenBazaar, and would be thrilled to use it.  The other big centralized alternative is full of fees, and isn't very high quality last time we tried it.  Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:26:14
Awesome!  Hopefully it helps if they are hearing from lots of different customers!  Good deal on Wordpress, its likely way more flexible yet.
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:08:54
Nice enjoy it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:49:14
Exactly, the way it should be
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:26:10
Franko appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:28:40
Thats a really curious thought.  You're right its like gold.  Each note the country issue is exchangeable for .00000001 Bitcoins or so

We're with you on that.  Need to spread around some of the Bitcoin cheer
@_date: 2014-12-11 22:28:54
Sweet man welcome to You have any coins yet?
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:36:44
We'll find out in practice once its released this week. I'm sure Apple spent a significant amount of time on the user interface and process (likely more than others) to really get it right.  Apple wouldn't have done all of this unless it was simple
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:03:30
And for all these reasons that people love Apple stuff, think it has a chance of succeeding where others have consistently failed.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:43:00
I've been in contact with a bunch of our suppliers and been asking about using Bitcoin.  My guess is that its only a matter of time when more suppliers start asking, then something is going to happen between businesses where it starts to make way more sense to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:00:36
QR Codes are universally available, but in my opinion not easy for the consumer.  People want whats really easy
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:02:48
Called to thank you since you're our first Bitcoin order.  We'll get the book out for you today.
@_date: 2014-09-16 14:41:53
Sweetness appreciate it!  Thanks for supporting with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:12:15
I thought they were supposed to announce BTC acceptance soon?
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:57:43
I'm thinking Apple tested all of this, to get it right.  But who knows, maybe they didn't.  We'll find out in October
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:11:32
Awesome enjoy your books!
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:30:52
Exactly! They have the connection with Stripe so shouldn't be too difficult to implement you'd think!
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:19:55
We'll see how it all plays out.  Some people think high priced, some think its all in the protocol and software itself.  Time will tell 
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:00:01
Awesome glad to hear it!

I'm totally down with the proactive move to bigger blocks.  Good move on Gavin's part making this happen
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:16:23
Appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-09-20 14:29:45
Awesome! Congrats on it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:22:43
It looks like something along those lines.  I checked a number of orders, and seems that Shopify uses a different address each time.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:13:01
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 13:19:23
I think people also didn't like it, since there is no confirmation needed for payment.  It just takes the money.
Where with ApplePay you have to put your finger on the reader to confirm the transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:05:40
Flipping it the other way around. Liking it
|  I consider 5% USD to be aggressive.
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:08:56
Sweetness thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:03:01
Thanks for testing it out and working with us!
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:45:41
Just cranked out 100 transactions.  Phew, that was intense :)
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:50:24
If it gives you one extra datapoint to help make your 20mb case, happy to sit here and crank out transactions
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:21:01
I'm in there on it.  
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:16:49
Think you're onto something. This is one part of bitcoin's design that I don't understand.  Since its so important having a wide diversity of nodes, why isn't there any incentive to run one?
@_date: 2015-05-12 10:37:43
Very impressive rollout!  Very sweet what you guys are up to
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:54:16
Appreciate the nice words!
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:29:44
Right on to that.  There's no other way to immediately, cheaply send money to anyone in the world
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:00:00
Thats some of the best phrasing!  Thanks for the Bitcoin warrior!
@_date: 2014-12-08 00:07:05
It seems like a completely different path than Coinbase.  Its a popup that asks for your bank details directly.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:10:56
The power to give a pat-on-the-back @_date: 2015-01-18 16:16:32
Thanks 36.02 bits @_date: 2014-12-13 03:02:05
Right on Coinbase!  One of my friends has been talking about bitcoin forever, just sent her 30,000 bits, now she has to claim it!
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:27:48
One of the biggest issues using an ecommerce system is control over the final checkout.  Most shopping platforms allow lots of control, until you want to choose payment methods.  i.e. if you want to use Stripe, Coinbase, or BitPay usually each ecommerce platform will only have at most one of them integrated.
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:03:55
Thanks!  Appreciate the love!
@_date: 2015-05-10 12:50:44
Interesting.  How would someone do that?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:16:54
Go to the last screen in checkout.  You'll have a choice of credit card, PayPal, or Bitcoin.  Select Bitcoin and can move forward from there
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:43:24
Its Adam from Baron Fig here!  Appreciate everyone's support.  
We made the big leap from physical products, to the digital realm!  Hope everyone enjoys, and also created a discount to celebrate!
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:41:33
Hah fair enough!  Better to hodl than spendl :D
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:29:25
Very cool, thanks for sharing and nice work on the programming!
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:15:56
Thanks appreciate it!  Yeah the Askew one with the funky lines was a controversial one, some people loved it while others not as much.  Good feedback on the music edition, we have a few new members of the team that are big into music as well.  Maybe at some point will make sense.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:57:52
Thanks!  Been quite an interesting 3 years :)
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:41:44
Everyone needs to dial down the rhetoric and work together to make something happen.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:18:57
Haha.  I know I just noticed that earlier as well.  I'll take it, I like seeing the flair :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:59:31
That's great to hear!  So glad they held up well for you.  Now just have to control that coffee habit :)
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:10:48
Its important that everyone have a chance to speak.  Otherwise they'll make their voices heard somehow
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:35:38
Haha.  That would be incredible.  Suddenly find 3 years worth of bitcoin sales :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:34:04
Appreciate it.  Been quite a journey and a lot like bitcoin lately.  Lots of things to keep it interesting
@_date: 2015-08-25 09:58:56
Hey its Adam from Baron Fig here. I know paper notebooks can sometimes be controversial :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:46:14
For sure!  Want to get this all sorted out!
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:49:04
There's still lots of white space on that map
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:13:47
Hey all thanks again for the support.  Just wanted to add, if you have any questions feel free to ask away!
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:53:52
Thanks so much for the good words!  Really glad the bitcoin checkout worked well, it took a long time getting to a super smooth checkout.  Let me know if you pick up a Work/Play!
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:29:37
Thanks appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:25:17
Hey everyone, its Adam from Baron Fig here.  Really appreciate all the support from and OP.  
We are big advocates of bitcoin here and try to do our small part to support the bitcoin ecosystem.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:02:30
In this case, just regular 100 gsm acid free paper :0
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:47:46
The guys over at Pen Addict did a really thorough review in relation to fountain pens.  
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:03:43
Awesome got it!  Will get them personally in the mail for you tomorrow!
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:24:49
Thanks hope she enjoyed it.  We always appreciate the feedback, who knows where the future takes us!
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:55:29
Thanks appreciate it!  Send me a PM once you order!
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:46:29
We're actually working on a lot of domestic production right now and excited to share once its ready.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:34:48
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:59:48
Thanks! Its all one step at a time so time will tell.  Good idea on signing up!

Congrats team thats one solid experience.  Nice work!

Certainly!  Want to support the Coin Center!  Your team is really important to helping advance bitcoin

Awesome thanks, appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:31:22
Sweet!  Glad it work, guess Coinbase was having some downtime
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:24:11
Thanks much.  We released the Work/Play yesterday which is a black book.  Might check that out.  Then we'll see what happens in the future :)
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:15:28
Keep up the good work Paxful!
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:57:31
Sounds good, let me know if you need anything!
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:31:44
Thanks so much!  We tried to get some really good paper, glad you're enjoying it!
@_date: 2015-07-15 16:07:18
Sounds good!  Send me a PM if you need anything!
@_date: 2015-07-15 12:33:03
Good suggestion, we're working on figuring out a good way of doing that!  Its all one little step at a time
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:37:10
Hah good question!  We make paper notebooks and sketchbooks, take a look if you get a chance
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:38:29
Appreciate the love!
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:16:53
It's Adam from Baron Fig here, thanks for the good words and hope you enjoy the new Work/Play!
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:47:58
We want to support the bitcoin ecosystem!  We really like bitcoin and since we're saving on credit card fees want to pass that back to the customer!
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:58:18
Yes!  Filled with paper!
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:51:17
Sweetness glad to hear it!  Always feel free to PM me if you need anything
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:46:46
All good, let the ideas flow!  Sometimes they come quickly, sometimes a little more slowly.  Either way, glad you're making use of your book!
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:35:25
Keep it up guys, really like the dedication!
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:24:09
Thanks!  Glad you got one.  Will get it in a bitcoin powered drone heading your way shortly!
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:32:38
Totally!  Hopefully big merchants start doing the same thing and offering permanent BTC discounts/reward as well
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:56:59
Sweetness!  Thanks for getting some books and so much better you paid with BTC!
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:40:14
Thanks appreciate it!  Any little bit we can do for the bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:27:51
Awesome!  Once you log into your Coinbase account, look on the left side for the Merchant tab.  Then go to settings.  There you can enable the bitcoin discount!
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:15:36
Thanks John!  Glad we could all work together to get it fixed up!
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:20:40
Thanks glad you like the dot grid!  
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:01:26
Awesome thanks for the detailed response.  Keep in mind at that volume level you might be able to negotiate your fees with the payment processors (BofA, Square, Stripe, etc).  So might try calling/emailing around some and see if they give you a better rate.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:51:10
Thanks Happy to help if I can
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:25:30
Thanks @_date: 2015-04-02 20:06:44
Well said!
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:16:58
Sweet thanks @_date: 2015-04-03 00:20:25
Thanks appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-04-02 12:51:45
Appreciate it!  This was something really important to us.  Took a good 3 months of back and forth between all parties involved, but very happy we got it all fixed!
@_date: 2015-04-20 12:46:50
Nathaniel- Awesome!  All of us over here at Baron Fig looking forward to it coming out
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:31:22
I wish! We were glad to get this fixed, so other merchants using both services could offer permanent bitcoin discounts.
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:26:38
In addition to accepting bitcoin on the site, we really like to be able to hang on to them.  Hopefully you're right and bitcoin sales take off :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:49:42
Nice, took me a minute to find it initially as well.  Log into your Coinbase account.  
Go to Merchants on the left side (if doesn't show, then might need to contact Coinbase to make sure you have a merchant account) and then Settings.  In there can enable bitcoin discounts and choose how much of a discount you want to give.  Let me know if that works for you
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:05:04
Exactly good call!  We have one supplier that will only take PayPal and since its international charges us something like a 4.5% fee.  I keep asking them about Bitcoin, hopefully at some point they adopt it.  Would love to save on those transaction fees!
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:24:42
Awesome glad Magento is super easy as well.  We found Shopify worked really well for our current needs. but will keep an eye out if Magento ever makes sense for the future!
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:26:39
Awesome thanks for pointing it out! Something for us to take a look at
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:23:36
Much appreciated!  We're adding new products one at a time.  We're a company of two people, so takes time to make high quality products
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:04:41
Awesome thanks!  
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:27:13
Hey the Confidant is a hardcover notebook and has 192 pages.  The pocket Apprentice comes in a 3 pack and each book has 48 pages.  Hope that helps!
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:25:20
Awesome glad you got some!  I'll take another looking at the mobile Coinbase checkout, thanks for pointing it out!
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:25:18
Awesome appreciate it!  Glad to hear you're liking your Confidant!
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:22:35
We tried both BitPay and Coinbase extensively last year and found customers had a better experience using Coinbase as their checkout flow.  Since we're only a 2 man shop here, had to focus our resources on the checkout customers seemed to enjoy more.  
Good call with BitPay, getting bitcoin discounts with them right also is a huge deal since they also have a big part of the market. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:55:29
Thanks Its been an interesting journey and glad we can do just a bit to help our customers and bitcoin.  
Glad to help anyone looking to start a business.  We're certainly no experts, but have learned a thing or two during the process.
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:26:10
Square is a good call.  There seems to be a bit of pressure on credit card fees right now with Square in the space.
Are you integrating Square into Shopify?
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:06:33
Great idea, thanks for the feedback! We're always listening and considering new things
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:49:01
Sweetness thanks for the support!
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:54:14
I know it, give it a little time :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:23:46
Awesome glad you're liking the book, hopefully filling with some good ideas!
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:48:54
Nice!  Donated!  First time using lighthouse, slick platform
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:35:11
Good question.  We pay hefty credit card fees everytime someone checks out with their Visa/Mastercard/Amex.  So when we get bitcoin, we pay 0 transaction fee.  Essentially we're passing our cost savings on to the customer.
Your second point is also correct, we want to help raise awareness and give incentive for people to use bitcoin.  We're big believers in the long term potential of bitcoin, and want to do our little bit to help the ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:28:19
Sweet appreciate it!  Let me know if you need any help.  Feel free to send me a DM!
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:24:06
Sweetness glad the books worked out for you!  Even better that you managed to get a few using bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:32:12
Sweetness!  Even better if you use bitcoin, grab that extra 5% off :)
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:52:52
Loving it!  Getting ready to tip it back!
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:47:42
Thanks for getting one!  Really cool this was your first BTC purchase!
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:09:54
Hey this is awesome! Someone better move quick and grab it!
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:57:23
Nice work on it, keep things moving forward!
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:50:45
@_date: 2015-04-02 12:57:20
Overall they do a good job as a payment processor.  I give them credit, they were very responsive throughout the process!
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:59:35
Thanks Appreciate all the support from the community!
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:03:46
Thanks appreciate it!  International we worked really hard to get rates that make some sense for shipping around the world.  As time goes on we hope to have other improved international options.  But with two people, its all one step at a time time!
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:44:47
Only 1.5, not 2 weeks^TM
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:45:32
Sounds awesome! Good luck with it, hope it goes well
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:06:36
Agreed lets move forward
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:28:31
Sweetness appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:22:48
Give the guys time.  Good for them, it takes long to get something good going
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:24:24
Awesome great call!  Will plan on donating to Wikimedia.  Really appreciate their work and spreading information.  I use it all the time (and I imagine many other users do as well!)
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:02:56
We've been accepting bitcoin for about 3 years now and love it.  is right we give 5% off for savings of the credit card fees.  If you want to check us out [baronfig.com](
