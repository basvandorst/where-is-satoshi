Done! And I bought a domain for it too:  there are still plenty of features I want to add. One at a time...

Thanks a lot. I've added a bunch of them, not all. Some are abandoned, fake or not forks. Thanks!

Thanks, I'll update the list. AFAIK Platinum was a scam, so I removed it. Whereas for United, it might be difficult to estimate the amount of forked coins you can claim due to their manipulated fork. Thanks, I'll update as much as I can today.
In fact, if you had links to resources about these, they're welcome! I should definitely add a way to submit forks on the site!

Yes, that is something I'm considering to add in the future. My first objective was to find the coins, and describing the risks. Meantime, I'm sure you could easily find tutorials online for BCH and BTG withdrawals though.

Forks are just like Bitcoin, they are not restricted to any specific area. There are several tutorials online explaining how to redeem your coins, just watch out for scams. If you were using an exchange or 3rd party to store your coins (e.g. Coinbase), chances are that you won't have access to the forked coins.

Hey guys,
I thought that considering the number of forks already present and the ones coming up, it would be handy to have something to reference them but also to help checking addresses for lost coins.
I also thought there was a need to educate users about the risks of redeeming coins on forked chains.
Any feedback is welcome. I would also appreciate some fact check on the security aspects described in there.
PS: Currently the API rate is limited, so hopefully it'll work when you try it.

Thanks, will look it up.

Sorry for the late reply. The value in USD should be updated every hour, I'll keep an eye on it to make sure it is. However, it is possible that our price sources aren't always up, finding the prices for some coins is difficult. I appreciate your suggestion to highlight what coins can be dumped, however there already are some other websites giving this information, such as u/forkdrop \([forkdrop.io]( and they do it well, so I'd leave that with them.
Note that at the very bottom of the report there is some Markdown content that can easily be copy/pasted. Someone could combine this with the information from another site to further tailor the report for you. For instance, filtering the coins that can be deposited. Perhaps I could have a word with u/forkdrop and see if they'd be interested in sharing some data over an API.
Thanks for your words of appreciation, we're happy that the tool is useful to the community!

The format of addresses is different whereas the prefix used for the addresses becomes 13AF instead of the traditional P2SH prefix used by Bitcoin.

Thanks man. Glad it helps!
