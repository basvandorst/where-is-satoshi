Here's the answer you're looking for: 
1.) It doesn't, because borrowing money is mutually exclusive from banking. They simply have the means to do so with a lot of money for a lot of people.
2.) Borrowing money and services can be governed by smart contracts. This is one of the big breakthroughs of blockchain: The chain is the record book of what happens, and blocks of code (contracts) will facilitate the transaction if pre-agreed upon conditions are met. 
Banking relies on a lot of fat and waste and is operationally quite the behemoth. In theory, smart contracts would replace whole systems or teams of people that would require time, money, and energy to make sure a transaction is valid. So in theory, Blockchain cuts out a lot of middlemen and wasteful staffing and therefore the functionalities of a bank can all exist on a chain (distributed database) that no one entity can control or overwrite. 
The act of loans and services does not change, merely the means of which they can be fulfilled.

I agree. 


I don't agree. If it does, then that's what it comes down to, but I feel too many people want to live for that to happen to the extent of what I think you're imagining it to be. Mutually assured destruction exists, but so does Mutually assured sustainability (even if that's not a thing, you get what I mean). 


It's futile.
Giving up takes absolutely no effort and change is hard because humans are fickle and selfish. Your experience and observations are fair enough, and I will not go out of my way to demean you for them because that's honestly the conclusion you've come to, but I personally will never admit defeat.

Maybe it'll be adopted as a legitimate currency in the future, but everything until now would absolutely categorize it as an asset. 
One of the definitions of an asset: 
- property owned by a person or company, regarded as having value and available to meet debts, commitments, or legacies.
That's what it has been until recently. As it becomes used more as a currency, sure it should be recategorized but the reality is that its roots resemble assets. 
And I wouldn't say nobody has problems with taxes. A lot of people have problems with taxes, and I'd wager that a few of them loiter in this subreddit. I've talked to people who like BTC because it can move society towards a "functioning anarchy", which is fucking insane. A good sum of them are against taxes for very wrong and very selfish reasons.

"Racism consists of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of biological differences between peoples. It often takes the form of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems that consider different races to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently."
Sit the fuck down. Try not to get too huffy, it's not of your alt-account persona, especially if you don't like being attacked for your obscene political views. Peace yo.

Racism has no place ANY dialogue. Literally the whole point of this squabble is "Don't be a fucking racist". You can't omit an /s tag and then be like "OH DUDE I WAS JUST BEING SARCASTIC." It means that there is some truth to your intention, whether you meant it at the time or not, and that's fucked up. It's shit like this that invented concepts like white guilt.

Literally anything with the word "Public" tacked on it? Do you understand the sheer amount of tax funded things you interact with every day? The existence of humanity is a collaborative effort. It's so easy to disconnect yourself from something that you have never experienced such as being born into poverty, living with chronic conditions, etc. If you think a modern developed society could get away with no taxes for anyone, you're fucking kidding yourself.

@_date: 2014-07-08 17:52:15
That's horrendously hyperbolic. That's not a problem with the concept of taxes, it's a problem with the people in power. Taxes is a pay it forward system, not choose how it's spent. Theres no way 1 person can decide how it's spent because 1 person will never have the insight to make those decisions. It takes a bunch of people from difference circumstances and backgrounds to make a complete and informed decision, and even that has its faults. We could go into a huge discussion about restructuring expenditure, but that takes decades of policy changes and moving the shitty people out of office and good people in, and I'd assume that you're completely aware of that. Do your part and vote for the good people. All these brown child killing, drone wedding bombing oldfags are gonna die one day and it's our duty as voting citizens to replace them with better people. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:05:04
It's a shame that people think like this. I'm open to opinions, and I'm all about taking new perspectives into account. If you list solid and informed points, I would never disrespect your opinion and would even be open to adopting a new ideology if the end result is a societal benefit. You're not open to dialogue, and you're not open to properly informing people of what you think is right (I'm looking at you, Monsanto hating GMO shaming shitlords who consider themselves professionals after reading one opinionated article that doesn't even cite sources). 
The two possibilities are, like you said, that you're either "tired" (which is a shitty excuse outright) of trying to convince people; which I'm okay with giving you the benefit of the doubt because it's the internet and a quarrel here means jack shit anyways, or your points are actually rubbish and the reasons you list are easily debunked by common sense.
Overall, that approach is incredibly selfish. You want something to happen, but you don't want to talk about it. If you're not even going to try or if you're not going to listen, **you are the goddamn problem.** 
And come on now, you can't be so naive to believe that a blanket statement like "just make it a free market" will solve everything. That's so incredibly short sighted. Sure the concept might be great, but concepts are concepts. There is more to the story. I know you know the intricacies of the world and its societies are not that simple.

Okay fine. You, one person feels like this, and decides to stop trying. Wait, now another person also feels like this because they happened to sympathize with your views, and decides oh man I'm just so tired of this shit, nothing is changing. And then another, and then another, and then another. 


I absolutely hate this reddit-centric sentiment. Shit gets a little hard, and all you do is get upset about how things don't happen the way you wanted it to happen. Change is hard specifically for the reason that one blanket statement or resolution won't solve everything at once. 


This is fine, you do you. I'm all for doing things for yourself, because in the end, nobody is going to take care of you. 


Please. Spare me the pity. Poor me with my positive thoughts. 


Social unrest is cool and all, but causing a public disturbance is kind of shitty especially when other people are trying to get on with their lives.  Don't get me wrong, the intention is good, but I would also rather not have something on the scale of Ukraine happening here. People hurting people is never right. 


This is indirect action, as you said. Have you considered running for office or a position yourself? But after reading your post, maybe you shouldn't. You seem easily discouraged and not very headstrong. 


History exists for us to reference, so we don't make mistakes and commit crimes against humanity again. If anything, it should encourage you to keep believing in what you believe, even if it's to have a civilizing conversation with one other individual about what you think is right. 


Like you said, our little actions don't do a whole lot to change the course of history, but large actions don't happen without little actions. No action is the actual crime here, and you fucking know that. Get over yourself and keep fighting for what you believe in.

Why is ETH a threat? Why does this have to be framed with conflict? What does ETH have anything to do with Bitcoin's shortcoming? Trying to vilify a cryptocurrency because it's "not Bitcoin" is some diet propaganda shit. 
 That's like complaining you failed a test but the terms of failure was unfair because everyone else studied more than you. Bitcoin timeline has been postponed due to all of this in-fighting so if progress wanes on Bitcoin, another [insert crypto with ***improvements***] will take its place, such is the nature of this open sourced DIY environment.  *Progress will be made, better coins will appear over time*, and dismissing that possibility is pretty crazy, given that you're currently talking to each other over a network of wires and pipes and electrical impulses. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:49:35
This sounds like an excuse, as if your hands are tied and you're forced to buy Bitcoin. There are plenty of other cryptos to invest in, and choosing Bitcoin above all else is your own decision. Altcoins is consensus functioning in a bigger way: Not sticking to one core coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:41:51
Bitcoin has had wildly diverging indicators all the way up to its ATH, and that's just ONE thing that pointed to it coming down, and it took you over $1000 of a drop to figure out it's time to short. What you just laid out as super impressive actually speaks volumes about what you actually don't know. I hope you know when to close, rooting for you!

Except you're not entitled to jack shit in this space. You're gambling on a highly speculative and volatile asset, with multiple parties in disagreement might I add, so if you can't hedge your investment against a situation where the majority affects your holdings, you shouldn't be doing this at all. You are not entitled to your $$$ once it's in Bitcoin. You're entitled to the # of bitcoin you own, but extrapolating it to the point where you're claiming that people are "stealing your money", they're not. You get to keep the same amount of bitcoin you had, and you even get some free bitcoin gold. This sub clearly doesn't even respect Bitcoin as an asset itself, and clearly only gives a shit about how much USD it's worth. All this bitching comes off as extremely hypocritical when the people that will be negatively affected by this fork only care about how much USD they can retain per Bitcoin. You don't even believe in the system yourselves and it's fucking pathetic.
