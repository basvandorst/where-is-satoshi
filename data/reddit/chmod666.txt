* After VM restart, wallet AND its backups are lost. (we suppose that wallet data was in instance-store and new AWS EC2 instance was powered up after settings change)
* Service is put up for sale for 17,000BTC to cover the bitcoin refunds.
**Unofficial statement translation:**
I wish to hereby inform all bitomat users of the system failure that occurred on 26 July 2011 and of its consequences.
Let me begin with an apology for such a long delay in releasing this statement. I postponed it only for the benefit of the investigation of the causes and people responsible for the failure. Unfortunately, to date, despite intensive efforts, I haven't been able to establish the foregoing.
I also think that any longer delay wouldn't be justified and I owe you an explanation.
On 26 July 2011 at about 11:00PM, I noticed that bitcoin server was out of resources and I had to increase RAM. As a result of this operation, the virtual machine was deleted and all data lost, including bitcoin wallet and its backups.
I have established that data was lost because settings of the virtual mashine were changed, although I didn't change them myself. Amazon Web Services Company, which hosts our servers, says that the cleared machine has been set up to be irretrievably destroyed (including the data on the disks) at the shutdown.
I'm still trying to establish who has changed the settings and whether I will be able to recover the lost data.  Unfortunately cooperation with Amazon Web Services is very difficult.  As soon as I realized that my virtual machine was lost I have ordered AWS premium support, talked to the manager and asked for securing of the disk data. So far, without success.
Up to now I haven't been able to clearly determine the causes of the failure. I presume that's the result of third party actions, which wanted to hide their illegal activities or intentionally wanted the service to crash. If that's so, I will report the case to the authorities.
I'm still trying to recover the lost data, but it requires support from the server's owner (and that, as I mentioned earlier, is difficult).
At this point I wish to inform and assure you that your money deposited with wire transfer and not converted to BTC and unpaid money from the sale of BTC remain safe and intact.  At the same time I am counting on your help in solving this problem.  I realize that the situation is very difficult, and that you are concerned about your BTC funds. We are constantly working on a solution to this crisis, and I'm open to your suggestions.
Today I intend to:
* Cancel all active orders 
* Restore the site and in particular enable PLN withdrawal 
Your suggestions and ideas are welcome.
I would like to inform you that I had several conversations with potential investors from home and abroad.
Www.bitomat.pl service is on sale for 17,000 BTC. If you are interested, please contact us at bartek

Perfect approach.. as long as you don't spend any money.

That's indeed a message that somebody has found a block.
It doesn't however mean you've been wasting cycles, because as soon as new block is found, server "pushes" that information to your client, and long poll is just a technique used for that:

Meh. Technical analysis crap.

They had separate database for trades on EBS. Wallet.dat was probably with bitcoind and rest of the application.

What software is that?  I'm fed up with gifs and random YouTube videos popping up on bitcoinity.org.
