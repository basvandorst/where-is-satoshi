Why not just make a program that I can go install on my offline, computer+printer, on my closed network, that just allows me to print something like this out? I mean, I know the USB would be nice and all but I don't wanna spend $40 on a dongle that has a sole function to just print stuff

You have my axe! (And my beer)

I broke an asic miner a while ago and just took off the heatsink and taped my QR code on it, ghetto, but looks cool haha. Thanks for the link, if I'm ever not tight on cash I might just pick up one of these legit ones.

Can someone explain to me the private key if you need the passphrase anyways? What's the advantage of even having that QR code on there (Not the public one, the BIP38)?
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:41:47
Like, no way

Vodka goes good with just about anything haha and no, thank you! keep up this awesomeness, I never even knew this was a thing!

&lt;Have been tipped before&gt;   
But I think this is a great way to start getting more attention toward Bitcoin. The hardest part about getting started with Bitcoin I think is def just getting some in the first place, and esp if you don't feel safe putting in cc info to buy. I can't wait for this to all really take off

So I can just say anything here?

To be honest (I've been mining for a while now, 1yr+) and if you don't already have mining equipment, it might not be worth it unless you're down to drop a lot of money. Bitcoin got very popular and the difficulty is currently getting very high up there, I'm about to stop just b/c my mining is really starting to slow and not sure if it's gonna cover power costs. I use BTCGuild and the min payout I think is still 0.01BTC and that is just getting harder and harder to reach. Just my 2 cents    
Other than that, welcome to the community

Ahh I can see that being useful. I guess I'll have to do some more reading on this. Not sure I would need this for any personal use, and everyone seems so edgy if they ever see it    
zomg, hide the qr code
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:05:42
Haha thank you!

I wish there was a way, for say, after 1000 connections or something have been used, you get a really small fractional amount (say 0.000001BTC, almost like a tax) that gets rewarded for doing something like this. There is no incentive besides feelsgoodman.jpg but it really is making the community more safer and stronger, and at a certain point it will nearly be insane to attempt to try to take over the majority of nodes to attempt for someone to exploit, which I feel is the only vulnerability (and maybe thieves) to Bitcoin. Where that money would come from though is beyond me.   
Props to you man, hopefully I can get one up and running as well.

Awesome! Merry Christmas to you too! Woohoo go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:24:38
Just don't transfer it into your wallet. Yeah I'm mining but as long as you don't cash out, it technically isn't in your wallet, thus shouldn't be taxable. Sorry IRS, not really interested in you stealing from my pot that is not suppose to be regulated by anyone.
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:01:31
This is what Bitcoin is all about, and various other block chains will for sure come from this and expand even more.
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:09:13
Easy

God ****ing damnit, I knew it was too good to be true
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:47:36
I don't know what you're talking about
Oh all this mining equipment and this wallet on my computer full of bitcoins?
Yeah, I'm mining for my poor friend in Malaysia - you'll never find him
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:17:17
And what medium would that income be?
The euro is regulated by the European Union, the USD, the US, etc.
Bitcoins, the internet? 
The point was to not have a governing body controlling any aspect of bitcoins
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:24:29
Hah! American-Israeli built, yeah I'll pass...
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:52:01
My point is, it's a lot easier to get people to switch to something else than it is to try and break Tor, and the fact that Israel had anything to do with it is the reason I'm gonna pass.
