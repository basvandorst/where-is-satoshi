While I want bitcoin to be just as "successful" as Facebook and Google this does actually ring some sort of chord with me.  On one hand, the disruption of Napster, Kazaa, BitTorrent was immediate because the flow of information (and files) was already unblocked... why hasn't Bitcoin followed the same success trajectory?
I expect it's related to the "artificial delay" of its adoption by the gatekeepers of finance, clunky user experience (for the everyman) and consumer understanding.  I still have hope that once you get the base protocols taken care of (Bitcon, Lightning, and anything else) and everyone starts spending time on the layers above to produce the analogous consumer facing products and services, you will have a more positive adoption rate for bitcoin-powered services.

No.  Try to see the forest, not the tree.
SegWit optimizes a block's information allocation.  Classic just increases it.  It's such a lazy man's implementation.
People crying for an increase now have no idea what it means to do bad engineering work now, incurring that technical debt, and the effect it has on the future of a codebase.

So he wrote a library that allows people to interface with a specific version of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core) without needing a local version of it.  I've written SDKs and libraries to wrap APIs and automate things for clients for work all the time but I've never been called a Lead Developer of the thing I was writing those things around.
How does this make him a "Lead" or "Prominant" Bitcoin Core developer (a title many people on this subreddit and in the media give him)?  In my mind, as a software engineer, you're a Lead Developer on something if you have a reasonable impact on the technical implementation of the roadmap of the product (Bitcoin Core), which to my knowledge he did not ever have?

Compare the actual Wallet developer's scoping of the work compared to an exchange's CEO - you begin to see who is closer to the reality of the situation here.

Awesome for getting into Bitcoin!  As a Bitcoin user since 2011, the easiest way for a newbie like yourself to get set up is to make it seem as much like cash, banks, etc as possible.  What do I mean?  See below.
- Get your own secure, private "bank account" via a cold storage wallet: 
This allows you store your bitcoin offline.  Send all purchased Bitcoin from Coinbase or other exchanges to the address of this wallet.  No one can steal it if you follow the instructions and are safe.  There are many options for this but Ledger is pretty straight forward and user friendly.  Some people may suggest getting the Bitcoin client, but we're trying to make the transition easy and painless at first.  Figure out that Bitcoin client stuff later.
- Get a smartphone wallet to substitute for your physical wallet.
You can send money from your cold storage wallet, or your "bank account", to this or any number of other wallets you set up.  Now your money is segregated into super secure and eh-works-for-me secure.  You can also exchange bitcoin with other people, businesses (physical or online) that accept bitcoin.
Example wallets include Mycellium, Aegis, Coinbase (is also a wallet but not in the same way others are).

We don't need adoption right now.  Bitcoin doesn't need anything at all.  It's working as intended.  We don't need anything except a functioning, decentralized store of value that will still have value 10, 20, 30, 100 years from now.
Classic does not give you that.  Classic sets you on the path towards NOT that.  Thank you.

Just because you have an opinion on Bitcoin does not entitle you to commit access to the Bitcoin Protocol.  A ton of people need to realize this.  And this is for the good of the ecosystem.  If you make Bitcoin shittier over time it will lose its value.
But maybe that's the goal by the anti-Core camp.

His economics on the price and miner profitability is so bad.  Price is a function of network power and network reliability.  If those two things are still sound at the time of the halving the price will just go up.  That's the incentive provided to miners to provide security to the network.

The SHA256 hashing solution is a binary thing.  It's either solved or it's not.  It's a 1 or a 0.  This can be thought of valid/not valid in bitcoin's case.  Now, just because 1 bitcoin node says a transaction is valid doesn't mean you should go on ahead trusting that node's word.  So a whole network of nodes does this to solve that problem.  Now, just because a whole network says a transaction is valid doesn't mean you should go on ahead trusting that network's word.  So bitcoin obfuscates that leap of faith to cryptography.  So trust is abstracted from trusting the network and its nodes to trusting cryptography.
It takes time to solve these cryptographic problems.  It requires time and computational power.  So grouping these transactions into bundles makes sense from an asset management standpoint.  These blocks require confirmations that other nodes reached the same conclusions and accept this consensus of valid transactions.

I actually kind of agree with Erik on the binary outcome thing.  I mean just take a minute and think about it.  Bitcoin will either continue to grow stronger with each attempt to subvert it until nothing can subvert it.  Or it will be subverted at some point and gradually become worthless because there is so much value at stake for it to not turn into something that someone, forgive my use of the term, rapes the crap out of.
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:45:37
Fear mongering against a fee economy.  Bitcoin is working as intended with the block size limit but people seem to think some non-existent sky is falling because transaction fees become more or less relevant in different periods of time.
Why is it a bad thing to have, in the short term, the Bitcoin community actually know what happens when fees are more relevant?  All the while effective scaling solutions are designed and implemented instead of reactionary forks with agendas to undermine the very underpinnings of the tech?
Fees are a part of any medium on which some sort of value is transferred - middleman or not.

I don't.  Because optimizing transactions, block space utilization, and other issues that are exacerbated by simply changing 1 to 2 just makes sense.  You 2MB blocker people WILL GET 2MB blocks when it's necessary.  It's NOT necessary right now. Whoever is telling you the sky is falling if we hit 1MB is lying for their own ends.  A fee market is NOT the end of the world.  It's Bitcoin working as intended.  We most likely will not even get a fee market by the time SegWit is rolled out and adopted.  And, in the case that we do, we get EXPERIENCE with a fee market and understand how it actually affects things.  This isn't Tetris where we reach the limit and it's game over.

Uh, wrong.  I value decentralization.  That's why I got into it.  That's why I use it over my many other mainstream sources of value storage and transactions.  Have you ever kept a balance at a Bank that is going bankrupt?  Have you ever kept a balance at a poker site and then had your funds disappear?  Have you ever had to rely on a 3rd party to transfer value to someone else but that 3rd party goes missing or is corrupt?  What the heck man?
Decentralization is the reason Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  Seriously, what the actual heck do you people think when they say "Oh, Bitcoin can be better if we just made it not Bitcoin via centralization."  What the actual heck?
