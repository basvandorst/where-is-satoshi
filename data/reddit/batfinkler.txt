Congratulations to HODLers Breaking $3000 is great news. Looks like my crystal ball is well off lol I thought the market cap pattern was going to repeat and we would see a huge correction ($35billion) before a massive bull run. I thought the market needed to wipe lots of bulls out, so they returned and revenge traded to make back their huge losses, and a fall from ATH to higher lower would attract even more new players into the market and provide more support to take the market upto $500 billion mark

It is a little ironic that one of the issues people have with FIAT is that banks can just print money whenever they want - hmm sounds like a BCC fork lol

Which bitcoin though BTC or BCH ?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:50:21
You are indeed missing my point ! 
To the people not currently in crypto forks do create more bitcoin ! 
You are probably correct that someone putting thousands of dollars into crypto probably (hopefully) knows the difference between BCH and BTC, but my grannie, cousin, hairdresser etc etc hasn't got a clue when they buy $100 of bitcoin. If it's called bitcoin pro, bitcoin mega, bitcoin "the dogs bollocks" to them its bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:27:58
So is the pump in BCH price because BTC miners have moved to BCH for more profitable mining but they will all move back to BTC ? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:34:43
As unbelievable as it sounds a number of very good Elliot Wave experts (way better than me) say BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:23:43
I'm trying to match up sentiment and Elliot Wave TA, which says that when the wave V is finished we will see a massive correction to the level of the prior wave which is sub $500 (eeek) sounds unlikely but that is what TA says.
Elliot wave says a news or event will come to justify the prediction, so I'm wondering whether this whole BCH confusion or a 25k BTC could be the event that triggers the correction
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:26:45
I'm starting to think you could be correct ! Bitcoins use as a store of value is diminishing with every fork. One of its selling points was it scarcity, and I know BCH, BCG (and future Bitcoin XXX) are not really bitcoin, but for many less attached to bitcoin, I fear they are viewed as the same !
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:34:22
So you think BTC is going to crash even deeper or was the last drop the big one ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:18:51
I agree that BCH is an alt coin but the drop in hashing power away from BTC is worrying 
Could it all be moving to BCH ? In which case it could overtake BTC ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:01:05
Couldn't the 25k BTC being dumped all of a sudden also contribute to a BTC crash ?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:10:26
I agree people should research before they invest, but the reality is FOMO kicks in and they see bitcoin x as a cheaper version of bitcoin and assume if bitcoin is $5000 that bitcoin x will be worth the same one day

I wasn't making reference to its price I was making the point we started with 21m bitcoin (less because loads have already been lost) and with every fork that number increases meaning bitcoin is less scarce. I know the others are not "bitcoin" but the other 99% of the world will not see that 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:14:05
Do you mean $4850 ? As $3850 is ok just now unless it goes lower of course - ETH and LTC ouch 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:12:28
Of course we could be totally wrong and it never reaches $3000 never mind lower, and goes to the moon from here, in which case it would also suck ! 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:50:49
Could even test $3000 resistance level then $2600 ? Not saying it will just saying it could

Decentralised exchanges simples !

We did seem to be in a predicted price correction when market cap dropped to 60billion (although many thought it would drop as low as 35billion) but then bounced back after the market was confident bitcoin was not going to melt down on 1st Aug. So you think after dust settles the market will return to its predicted price correction ? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:23:20
Why you think a dip is inevitable ? Plus won't it be risky buying on Aug1st ? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:55:23
I thought Aug 1st was a non issue now BIP 91 locked in ? Thought it was going to be smooth sailing now ? Has something happened to change that which would see price plummet ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:38:30
Did the bubble not burst when price corrected and market dropped to 60billion ? Could it be we've  returned already to a bull market ? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:28:26
I assume you think price is going to tank ? Why ? Cheers
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:16:22
Is it safe or any increased risk of storing euros in Coinbase ready to buy some currency after Aug 1st 
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:22:56
Good advice thank you 
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:00:01
Does BCC come into existence on Aug 1st or November when the hard fork takes place ? 
Secondly If BCC has support and is currently being valued at $500 will this likely mean the price of BTC drops on Aug 1st ? 
Finally when the hard fork happens in November will we then have three versions of bitcoin ? BTC, BCC and B??
Thanks
