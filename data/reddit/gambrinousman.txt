I tried to figure it out online and it said 0.0004 btc is 40,000 satoshi? I can't tell if it calculated it wrong or if I'm paying way too much for the mining fee....

I'm about to move 0.06 btc and I'm thinking of using 0.0004 btc as my mining fee, is that enough? Still a bit of a noob and just don't want my money getting stuck in limbo for weeks

Can someone explain what I'm looking at here? Trying to figure out GDAX out but I'm struggling. What do you mean by "wall"?

I have a question about number 3. Can I just set it up that lets say any time the price drops to let's say 10,000 it will automatically buy and then any time it goes past 15,000 or something it will automatically sell?

Yes please

What do you mean by airdrop?

Is the green bars sells and the red bars buys or is it vice versa?

Are you sure it needs to be on an exchange? I managed to get my BCC and it was on my electrum wallet

Anyone got 5 bucks?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:07:52
It's a rather small amount, only 0.108, wouldn't all that changing back and forth cause a lot of mining or transferring fees?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:33:12
I've about 0.1 btc in my etherum wallet, what's going to happen to it if I just leave it there? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:39:24
Find any solution?

Making an account now, it's asking for a referral code? Should I put anything into this or leave it blank?

I use electrum, not too sure what a recovery seed is

With Independent reserve it says I must use ID that matches my Australian address but I don't have any ID with such address, what should I do? My passport isn't Australian

Genuine question, is it too late to invest in bitcoin? I've 500 euro spare right now, is there any point in me using this to buy 0.1 BTC?
