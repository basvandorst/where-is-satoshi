I remember dollar parity. “Tulip mania.”
Just wish I bought in then. Had I dropped 100 bucks on it then I’d be able to afford my own butler.

Which is great when you’re already rich and have multiple millions to play around with. At that point it’s time to play it safe (and he’s earned the right at this point).
He’s certainly a switched on guy all politics aside but the HE invests and YOU invest are going to be very different. He’s likely only got another 10 years left in this world tops and is already insanely rich. You are most likely 20-40 years old and nowhere near his level of wealth.

Meanwhile they’re the biggest miners in the world lol
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:43:37
It pains my soul knowing there’s like millions of dollars worth of crypto that’s gone forever from that stuff. Or morons like me who misstyped something years ago and send what would now be several thousand dollars worth of litecoin to some random likely non existent address :(
@_date: 2019-07-08 03:27:46
Honestly in the time you took to write that, you could have pulled up a myriad of free auto translate tools. Makes far more sense to do that rather than ask someone else to retype something in his non native language, especially after he’s already taken the time to go this far for you.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:55:34
Wait what? In that same time window (early 2016 till now) bitcoin has gone up 28 fold whereas litecoin has gone up 33 fold. Obviously hindsite is 20-20 but you'd have been better off with litecoin from an investment standpoint as well as a functional use standpoint. What is moronic exactly?
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:33:48
Because that day makes it look like a constant rise and ignores the blood bath between October 2017- basically now.

I mean, losing thousands to gain a few cents is not really the best way to go long term lol.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:02:46
Lol if you bought 2 years ago you’re as boned as the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:07:24
Yeah a LOT of people had huge gains this year and I’d imagine would want to cash out for the 2018 tax season. So I’m personally going to hodl off till then on dipping back in. I got out at a good time earlier this month and so anything below 1800 is good for me to get in ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:51:13
Ah ok. I figured most would want to wait till 2018 to do it. To NOT make it in this years taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-08 04:41:48
Because I’m not the one who asked, you did.
Take some basic responsibility dude. If you want something translated into your language then you do it, don’t just feel entitled to having someone else do it for you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:44:54
About 2 weeks ago. Things seemed to have peaked then did a huge dip then went up a little but have remained steadily lower than it was. Just curious if this is an agreed upon floor or if it’s mainly cuz of the holidays. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:38:58
Nah. Cuz most of you would have either sold it at 20k to get out or would still not sell at a million “cuz it will go to 2 million by Christmas”
@_date: 2018-08-16 19:43:53
Now imagine the excitement for those who got in heavy in early December! ��
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:07:43
Yeah I just mentioned z cash off the top of my head. Could be anything I’m not picky. If they make that as easy as something like Apple Pay then it would be adapted crazy quick. 
And Apple is actually one of the better companies in terms of ads. Their business model isn’t built around that so while it may come, it will be one of the last ones to do so. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:30:54
Eh. I’m all for privacy but I truly don’t care in the least that Apple knows I spent 40 dollars on gas last week and 50 bucks at the grocery store today. If it’s going to be something shadey then I’ll use cash of course but it’s simply the fastest and most convenient way to pay for anything and since the subject was on simplicity, this is it. 
If it could be done with zcash or something actually private? I’d be even happier. Till then I’ll use the best available at the current time you know?
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:19:07
My wallet is my watch. Get on my Apple Pay level bruh. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:47:51
I know it's not there yet lol. I'm saying where it NEEDS to get for wide adaptation. Heck I'm considered a nerd for using something like Apple Pay and it's a few years old already. Crypto needs to become fast and easy if it's going to seriously compete as a used currency and not just a glorfied stock.
@_date: 2019-03-24 16:41:51
Ehhh that “tax free” part is concerning. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:20:18
What moron posted and what greater morons liked it?
Bitcoin is great for many things but this is the exact situation for physical money. Cuz no bitcoin isn’t always working, you need both electricity AND a network.  two points of failure.
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:53:47
Can’t pay taxes if you’re selling for a third of what you paid. I guess that’s a positive..:
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:37:06
Not really.
I and a few other friends got in last fall because we honestly want to use crypto as currency. We believe in it long term and want to be a part of it.
However it absolutely sucks to have bought several grand worth when bitcoin was at 16,000 and now it’s down to a third of that. It means we’re massively screwed if I want to actually USE it, because it would be absolutely stupid to buy something with bitcoin instead of cash right now, I’d basically be paying 3 times more for it.
I don’t have any illusions of being able to buy a lambo or any of that nonsense. I just want to use it as intended... except if I do that at today’s rates I’m paying 3 times more than I should and that’s just foolish. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:22:40
Wait what? Who in this entire thread say anything about buying more bitcoin? I think you either replied to the wrong person or you have very poor reading comprehension skills.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:40:34
I believe in crypto as a concept and it's something I'd like to use going forward. But I'm not spending 3 times as much money just for the privilege, that is just asinine.
There's a dramatic difference between the "speculation" crowd that's hoping their coin "goes to the moon" so they can buy a lambo, and people who don't want to be financially irresponsible and buy things at a 2-3 times markup. Use your head dude.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:00:49
Again, a financial loss.
Let’s say I do it your way. There’s an item for sale online for $100 and the seller also accepts BTC (and like 99.99% of vendors; they value it in relation to the USD.) 
So I could buy it in BTC and then go to Coinbase and buy another 100 dollars worth of bitcoin and be right back where I was right?
Wrong. Because now I’m effectively paying 104 dollars for that item with exchange fees AND I just made life more complicated for myself. It simply isn’t prudent.
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:21:09
You may be technically correct with the term. I just don’t see it as being “used” unless you’re actually *using* it as a means of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:55:50
Yes, it VERY much does.
Let’s say I want to buy product X. It’s listed online for 100 dollars or .00045 (or whatever) Bitcoin.
If I spend my bitcoin I purchase at 16,000 on it, I’m effectively spending 300 dollars on that item which is absolutely irresponsible.
For another way to think about it, let’s use gold. Let’s say a year ago you bought a bunch of gold bars for $16,000 each. Since then the price of gold has plummeted and now each bar is only worth $6000. You tell yourself it doesn’t matter since you still have gold right?
Now you go to the pawn shop and want to buy some stuff and they will accept gold at the current market price. You see an item you like and it cost $16,000 dollars. Great, just give him a single gold bar and you’re done right?
Wrong. Since gold is worth a third of what it was when you bought it, you need to use **3** gold bars now to make that purchase. Effectively you just paid $48,000 dollars for a $16,000 dollar item. 
So if you spend bitcoin today and you bought when I did, you’re paying 3 times more than you would if you bought something with cash. It’s just foolish. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:15:47
Pretty close. I enjoy this sub but I am aware it’s the top .001% of positive seeking owners. It’s a very narrow snapshot of the market as a whole and it’s almost completely small non players. The guys who have big money in this aren’t posting on Reddit lol.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:05:53
Yep, I tried catching it at 10k thinking that was the floor and nope. Now I gotta sit here and pray it goes back up so I didn’t just waste a ton of money.
@_date: 2019-08-17 13:22:08


Wtf? You *seriously* think it's going anywhere? Good lord dude.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:08:18

Hey that's me! I'll be making a ton of purchases the moment it hits 14000. Bought quite a bit when it was going up at that point, then on the way down " cuz lol it's on sale" said ever single source.
Lesson to be learned? No one knows a GD thing about what's going to happen, don't risk money you're not willing to never see again.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:19:13
You really shouldn’t be using a credit card dude. Just the worst possible option. Setup a direct bank withdrawal and use something like Coinbase. 
Don’t let FOMO influence you one bit. You have loads of time.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:26:54
That’s an entirely different thing though and it’s not what you said. You said “the exception that proves the rule” not “the exception TO the rule.” The second one is logical, the first one is retarded.
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:01:14
So is cherry picking dates to avoid the dips.
The point is that graphs can easily be manipulated to mislead stupid people. While yeah overall over the last decade bitcoin has gone up, it’s not some constant magical thing. Plenty of people have gotten utterly wrecked.
It’s fine if you are viewing it as a long term speculation. It’s NOT fine if you’re someone who actually plans on using it as currency. Because if you bought at a high point and it drops, you’re not able to actually spend it now without suffering a huge loss.
@_date: 2019-08-01 14:37:25

@_date: 2019-10-16 19:17:34
Yep. Bought in at the 12 k “floor” and been unable to spend it without taking a big loss.
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:19:04


Ah yes, the essence of class and maturity. ��
And I don’t care if it’s some random proverb; it’s nonsense and simply wrong.
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:17:27
Especially if you bought in the last 2 years. Really sucks to sell or use at a loss, it’s like money that’s held hostage.
@_date: 2019-10-19 23:23:03


Lol dafuck kinda world do you live in where you can type something like that, look at it, then decide “yes this is logical and makes sense.”
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:21:17
Bought at 16000. Then it went up and I was careful.
Then crash.
Then this sub chanted “buy the dip!”  at 15000. Then again to “buy the dip!! It’s on sale” at 12,000.
Then again at 10,000.
Then again at 8,000.
The point is do NOT listen to anyone on this sub or anywhere else, not a single one has any idea what the big investors are going to do to manipulate this market again.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:16:36
Well at a certain point you just accept you have to hold it and can’t spend any of it until I goes back up. 
It’s the biggest problem with bitcoin, if you want to actually use it as a currency to buy stuff with, you have to use fiat to purchase it then immediately make a purchase or risk losing purchasing power. 
It makes it really hard to take it seriously when half the people are holding cuz they want to be rich and the other half are holding because they don’t want to literally have the value of their money cut in half by spending it.
@_date: 2019-02-08 00:55:40
This is why *crypto* will succeed. There’s nothing special about Bitcoin here and there’s actually many other coins that are better for these kind of fast anonymous transactions.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:22:19
Don’t worry; the bankers just made their millions. Easy money for them. ����
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:37:05
5000? Yay only at 40% of what it cost when I “bought the dip cuz it’ll never go below 12,000” ��
@_date: 2019-04-06 02:48:01
It’s a talking cartoon. It’ll never make sense lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:04:50
That’s my whole point, we have no idea lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:17:11
The point is the ratio dude. Don’t be daft yourself. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:00:56
And at 50% if you got in in November or December. ☹️
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:32:11
Your point is irrelevant to the discussion. You may as well have said “I like baked potatoes.” That’s great and all but it doesn’t impact the top level comment. 
There are plenty of valid reasons to judge bitcoin or ANY currency/commodity by something other than it’s yearly lows. All that matters to the person holding is “what was it worth when you bought it, and what is it worth now.” 
Everything else is noise, hype, and emotion.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:17:22
And I pointed to a clear and logical example of why looking at yearly lows isn’t a great indicator. It makes for a fun meme and circle jerk and little more.
Crypto currency isn’t exempt from economics. It has tremendous potential as a technology and we are all on this sub because we want to see it succeed. But you have to temper hype with logic.
Principle over preference.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:48:08
And when you got in at 15,000 none of these dips matter either... cuz you can’t pull out without losing big time right now. So may as well just forget that money is tied up there till it rebounds ��
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:48:42
Lol! This is so incredibly ignorant and out of touch. People said that at 10 dollars. People said it at 100 dollars. People said that at 1000 dollars. People said that at 10k. So please don’t try to give anyone that garbage now dude.
“It’s at an all time high, it’s going to pop!” Said every pessimist for the past 7 years. It finally turned out to be correct and everyone acts like “yeah I knew it.” 
Just tired of this Monday morning quarterbacking. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:07:22
So if you actually were lucky enough to have like 40 million dollars worth of bitcoin... how would you actually convert it to cash? Like what exchange or who would buy that much in a lump sum?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:41:52
There not magic beans, they’re miracle legumes. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:52:44
*cries because this is actually mostly true for him*
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:06:15
Or it tells you the people who got in at a high time and can’t afford to actually spend it at such a loss?
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:25:10
I believe reading comprehension may be difficult for you, I never said “selling.” I very specifically said “spend.”
Let’s pretend you bought 1 bitcoin for 15,000. Awesome, you must want to use currency outside of the main systems, that’s great.
Then after a few months it drops in value to 5,000. It has a third the spending power it did when you bought it.
If you spend it now, you are a **complete** fool. You would be spending 15,000 dollars worth of currency to get only 5,000 dollars worth of product. At this point you would be far smarter to use regular cash for any transactions until your crypto has more value. 
I won’t comment on how to look at it investment wise. But purely from a transaction management standpoint, you would be foolish to use it for anything if it’s that far below your purchase point. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:12:47
I made no judgment value whatsoever, we were talking about which is better for YOU to hold and have long term and something deflationary like bitcoin or solid like gold makes far more sense than fiat. Relax, have a snickers. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:10:53
That’s what I’m saying. People are acting like this is some crazy thing and it really isn’t. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:19:36
Congrats to you then friend. So imagine what it would be like if it hit 45 cents today. ��

Oh I know this one!

No one said turn it into fiat. They said launder.
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:23:35
I think it’s less about “to the moon” as it is “at least stay where you are without flipping into a ditch.”
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:35:52
Unfortunatly we will have to wait for the entire market to float up as far as I can tell. I'm not super concerned since this is a long term play for myself but still, even with dollar cost averaging as I went in I'm looking at about 40% below overall. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:46:49
This assumes you don’t have a phone. You can certainly still text and do basic stuff with the 100 dollar phone sure but that’s not the point. The point is that for the vast majority of people, having that phone is going to be far more useful. Putting a grand into crypto right now isn’t going to change your life. But you’ll never look back at pictures and video of your young children and think “man I wish I had this in worse quality.” You can’t get those moments back no matter how many millions of dollars you have.
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:23:25
Not “thanks bitcoin,” it’s “thanks people who bought in recently.”
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:02:10
Yeah? And plenty of “success stories” that began walking into a casino to pull the slot machine.
It will likely end up holding value long term but only a fool would get in this late in the game and actually expect to see that kinda gain.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:27:03
Depends. There’s plenty of services you can buy things based on crypto (and there will be  much more in the next year or two. Seriously look how much has changed in just the past ten years, iPhones were brand new and now everyone has one even little kids). You can diversify into other cryptos and see it as an investment.
And you sure fiat is more valuable to ya? The dollar is dropping every single day and is worth less than 2% of what it was 80 years ago. Meanwhile I don’t need to tell you about what crypto has done overall.
Things like bitcoin especially are a deflationary currency, there will never be more than a set amount therefore it will only get stronger over time.
@_date: 2019-09-14 19:03:01
You do you man.
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:38:52
Exactly. You can’t take it with you, money is a tool to be used to provide for our needs and wants. If you already have those things then yeah totally invest your money for future things.
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:05:31
Except with the phone you can actually DO things. From play games to capturing unrepeatable family adventures with your kids. 
Investing is great once you have enough surplus and are looking for ways to preserve and expand your wealth. But money is simply a means to and end, don’t forget that.
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:15:47
Which is awesome if you got in early. For everyone else, not so much.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:32:19
Instead you bought it at 16k then “bought the incredible dip” at 12 then again at 10 and 8.
Going to be a long time before some of us can actually spend it without settling for a huge loss lol
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:34:38
Why do women cover their mouths when surprised/sad in western culture? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:32:50
All that’s relevant is the point that YOU bought in. If you got in in 2016 then yay for you, you’ve gained purchasing power. If you got in in October-November 2018 then you have effectively lost 80% of your purchasing power. You can either hold and pray for it to rise again or spend it now and basically be paying 5 times more than you would if you paid in cash.
