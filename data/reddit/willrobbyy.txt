you could advertise on a free btc website, that way you attract literally only the people "bitcoin users" your after. seems a lot smarter than any kind of traditional advertising to me try these ones

coinbase wont let me buy either, i have read on here that some people have been lucky and been able to get through so at least we know its not anything bigger than they say it is, 
I just got on the bitcoin train as well and i have only been able to get btc 2 ways, i have purchased a total of 1 btc from coinbase, then there are websites where you can perform tasks, watch video's, or even some will just pay you for visiting, there are a ton out there. its little amounts but hey dude, its free bitcoin right
here are a couple links to get you started
