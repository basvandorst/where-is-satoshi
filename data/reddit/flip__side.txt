Options for suing the company/reversing the transaction for services not rendered?
The more I read about CEX, the more and more it seems like it’s one of the most unprofessional and poorly run  major exchanges out there.

Buy an ethereum while they’re still cheap. You can get a whole one for 1k... for now

1 btc = lowest-tier shark card for GTA online 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:50:14
I think a 100000 valuation by 2020 is certainly possible. As it stands 1 btc = roughly a pound of gold. That is still pretty insane
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:41:22
Idk. The money I have in my wallet right now was originally 20 dollars I had extra from a transaction. I forgot about it and kept it in there for 3 years and signed in today to discover free money. The temptation to cash out is extreme considering it was never even an investment
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:56:24
I mean musk isn't wrong so far. Transactions for Illicit items have been going on for far longer than legal ones since bitcoins inception. 
But he also invented PayPal so why would he want btc to succeed 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:25:56
You have no idea what you're talking about. Notice how when bitcoin loses value, your litecoin/ethereum does too? If "shitcoin" ain't worth shit, neither are your altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:53:45
I see, so it's kind of a way to trade for bitcoin that will potentially be worth something greater, but in all likelihood will fade off into obscurity?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:56:22
Very true. The idea that this would be some long term investigation is almost nil. They are probably panicking from all the cash outs and are worried about future solvency 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:14:00
Then you're untaxed boiii

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:31:38
This is my logic. Gotta pay some bills with my new gains and then gonna buy back a bunch of bitcoin once it hits 5k again and everyone starts freaking out and selling cause of the 2018 crash 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:54:26
How does one go about doing this

What does this mean? Is there free bitcoin somewhere other than in my wallet?

It's mine. Gonna have to ask that you return in to my wallet pm me for details thx
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:43:21
So-- okay forgive me i'm retarded and I just discovered a decent amount of tendies in my circle wallet yesterday. The crypto I haven't touched since 2015; is this "old bitcoin"? Is it somehow worth less than super bitcoin that will emerge from the new blockchain?

No one knows what the fuck bitcoin is going to do. Might as well enjoy the memes as we bite our nails. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:52:34
Only if bitcoin continues to increase in value... 17k isn't even enough to turn a profit with day trading 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:16:17
Let's hope not

There are way too many millionaires who believe in bitcoin and want it to succeed for.bitcoin to ever lose all of its value. It's completely backed by the tech.

yea its cause I have to refresh the damn search every 10 seconds to see if I lost all my money or made a ton

No you can't transfer Any btc into circle
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:28:18
seriously this shit is absolutely mind blowing. I logged into my old circle account today and found 2000 bucks worth of free money. 26k by the end of the year would be fucking amazing and it doesn't even seem unlikely. I'm scared the dip will hit before 20k though
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:23:07
This is the saddest thread I've yet to see on this sub
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:28
I don't get it
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:38
Yes. There might be a decent dip but bitcoin will be fine 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:44:25
You think people are gonna want corporations touching their money 24/7? The only thing that I can think of that would be more crooked than the banks controlling my money is Apple. Bitcoin is popular because no 3rd party can do anything with the money you're holding.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:42
With bitpay you're still not technically on the block chain right? Doesn't it just convert your btc in to usd where x vendor will accept it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:16:41
I would also say Gemini. Afaik, they are the only crypto exchange that is regulated as a trust. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:48:48
Jeez man, the guy just lost 17k

Are you seriously holding 250k worth of coins in an online wallet or are you joking? You can put your Trezor in a safety deposit box. Just make sure to take it out before the banks collapse

It’s crazy you took the time to make this post complaining about people posting about bitcoin on a bitcoin sub. I swear redditors are some of the most annoying, picky people alive
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:56:58
I think the biggest problem with BTC isn’t necessarily that people don’t understand the technology, but that the technology simply doesn’t interest them in the same way that, say, the internet does. Not many average Joe’s are sending large sums of money overseas on a daily basis. The quick exchange of currency is basically what the ‘revolutionary’ use for bitcoin is. People who are inundated with pop culture and the latest interactable gadgets all the time simply aren’t interested in tech like this:

No but I’m not bitching about other people having a social gathering in Tel Aviv. You’re acting as though everyone at that bitcoin gathering is somehow responsible for the plight of Palestine. It just sounds like you’re complaining to complain.

Although his sentence was too extreme, I still think he deserves jail time. He profited off of assassinations, racketeering, drug production, and fraud. I understand that the Silk Road was a cool idea for books or whatever, but he let it get way too out of hand and now he’s paying the price. Don’t think this guy deserves a pity party in the slightest . Dude is a piece of shit in my opinion

This is like saying “the PS network shut down. No matter how hard someone tried, no one would be able to shut down NBC. NBC doesn’t care about your PlayStation”
