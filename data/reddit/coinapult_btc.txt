Yes. This bot is provided by Coinapult, and uses the Coinapult API for wallet functionality. It also has our Locks feature, which lets users tie the value of their bitcoin holdings to USD, EUR, or GBP. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:54:04
We're definitely familiar with Telebit, and we're fans of their team as well. 
The main difference between Tender Wallet and Telebit is that the Tender bot allows users to Lock their bitcoins to USD, EUR, and GBP. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:32:10
hi there :) the wallet relies on Coinapult, as well as Telegram, for it's security. Coinapult is storing the private keys within it's own multisignature wallet, and Telegram uses SMS to verify their user. While we don't claim this to be the most secure wallet, it's meant to be very convenient, and has instant access to our Locks feature. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 21:29:23
Hi Eric, currently, we require 4 block confirmations for incoming txns. However, we are shortly changing this to 2 block confirmations. We'll update here when that change has been made.
Important to keep in mind, one of the cool things about Locks is that you can generate what we call an Autolock address. This means that any coins sent to that particular bitcoin address will be automatically locked to the fiat currency of your choice (USD, EUR, or GBP currently). Your rate is locked in immediately when coins are detected on the network, and your balance is confirmed once there are the minimum required block confirmations (currently 4, will shortly be 2). 
Hope that helps, let us know if you have any other questions ;)
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:22:39
fair point, we've edited the announcement to better reflect prizes are paid via BTC. Users who use EUR or GBP will have coins sent to their GBP or EUR Lock address. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:17:51
All three accounts would in fact be generated from the same seed, so you would only be entered 1x.
Nifty thing is, because all Coinapult addresses are generated from the same seed as Mycelium, you can restore your Coinapult accounts as well as Mycelium account all with the same back up :)
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:47:59
apologies, will bring this up internally to raise the avg miner fee. if you send an email to support we can try rebroadcasting the txn
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:10:20
you only need to lock, or unlock, $15 worth of bitcoin in order to be entered :)
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:16:50
glad that worked :) thanks for entering!
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:25:40
Yes, a lock is initiated simply by sending bitcoins to your Coinapult address within Mycelium.
You can save your Coinapult address to your 'My Addresses" list. 
If you are not seeing an address when you open your Coinapult Lock account, try clicking "reload account". We have had a few customers point out this issue, we are working on a permanent solution now. In the meantime, clicking "reload account" should work and generate a Coinapult bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:36:29
unfortunately no, Coinapult Lock accounts not yet available on the Mycelium iOS app. hopefully soon though :)

We have a user introduction video you can view here: 
When you open your Coinapult Lock account, you can save the Bitcoin address generated to your Mycelium address list for future use. So long as you are within a Coinapult account, the bitcoin address displayed will automatically be a Lock account. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 12:40:28
the prizes are, of course, being distributed in BTC, to the users' USD/EUR/GBP Lock account :)
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:42:30
Yes, if you updated Android or the app in the interim, your Coinapult account will *appear* as though it is gone. However, it is still registered to your same Mycelium wallet seed, and will reappear as previously was by re-opening a Coinapult Lock account. 
We are working on fixing this UI issue so as not to scare users. Feel free to both register your email address through the app, as well as send a small txn and send the txn id to support This way we'll all be able to correctly identify your account without issue. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:47:49

Great video about truly exciting tech. The Coinapult team is looking forward to the Factom launch!
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:40:00
Agreed that this is not the most secure bitcoin wallet. Most Coinapult wallets do have 2fa capability.
Like many other services and products, there is a compromise between security and usability. This particular service is aimed at people who have no second device, or  general computing device. Simply put they have no method of doing a second authentication. Yet, this service is still far superior (even in the category of security) than the other options available to them.
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:05:55
Any Bitcoin user can use our Locks service to completely remove Bitcoin price volatility from their day-to-day Bitcoin use :)
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:56:53
is correct with this statement. The Bit Drop team has been in discussions with alternative hosts, and hoped to be able to announce a smooth transition to a better partner. While that is still a possibility, at this point the best case scenario would at least involve pushing back the event date. Our current plan is:
If a new venue is selected by the end of the month, donors will be given the choice of a refund or leaving their donation for the new venue.
If a new venue is not selected in time, all donations will be returned.
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:08:15
This is a complex undertaking. For instance, Coinapult estimates that the event could generate a couple of transactions per second. This is on par with the entire bitcoin network, today. We are working with local telecoms to ensure the reliability and security of the messages.
Our other partners like CCN also need time to create and distribute marketing materials to local volunteers.
We need to reach out and negotiate with artists, vendors, etc..
In short, have you ever tried throwing a party for 70000 people? It ain't easy.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:42:25
Yes, it is possible that a dishonest telecom or telecom employee could intercept or distort the messages. For this reason, Coinapult does not advise using these accounts for large amounts or long-term storage. Our SMS wallet is a convenience for people with few/no options.
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:36:10
Do you have any ideas on how we could make it easier? We'd love to hear them!
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:25:02
Default account limits are $3000/transaction and $25000 per asset.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:23:10
correct! Lock accounts let people receive, send and spend Bitcoin, but store fiat-based values. 
And unlike many exchanges or services, it's instantly available to anyone, anywhere :)
Next time you're trying to pay back your friend for that movie/dinner/poker night, and he says he doesn't want to gamble on bitcoin, just have him download the Mycelium app with Coinapult Locks ;)
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:12:16
If you know what price in USD, EUR, GBP, gold or silver that you would like to charge, you can simply quote the price in those terms. You will receive that amount of value and it will be constant until you chose to unlock. Of course, if you don't know the price of your own merchandise in one of those currencies, Locks won't help you. 
One has to wonder how you would negotiate payment by other methods, though...
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:16:07
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:43:55
If you discount the huge mainstream media hype that happened last year, temporarily and artificially inflating the price to $1000, you would be able to make the case for a continuing upward trend over the life of BTC.

1. Most individuals in the world (+50%) do not have bank accounts. Locks allows them the ability to keep their wallet value stable, and does not require having a bank account.

Locking is definitely not selling, nor is unlocking buying. Locks customers only ever have title to bitcoin, never other assets. This is important, because we won't, for instance, send a customer $1000 if they have $1000 locked.
As far as the possibility of people gaining or losing bitcoin using the service, we have tried to be very up front about that possibility. Since it wasn't very clear, we will renew our efforts to appropriately warn users.
Finally, as far as "all of the benefits of bitcoin", you are correct to point out that there is some counterparty risk in using the Locks service. For the service to work, you must voluntarily give us access to the amount of bitcoin you wish to Lock. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to say "all of the benefits of the bitcoin transaction network", which are retained in full.

For a bitcoin user to transact in colored coins, they need a special client. This is because colored coins are an upgrade to the protocol. Locks is compliant with the standard bitcoin protocol, and the other party doesn't need any special upgrades.

Hi, Coinapult here. If you have $600 of BTC locked using our new service and tomorrow Bitcoin tanks to $300, you will still have $600 worth of BTC. This is exactly the problem that our service was designed to solve. We will never ask for your credit card details.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:34:25
Yes. It happens very often here in Central America. For instance, there are almost 1 million Nicaraguans living and working in Costa Rica. They send many remittances home to their families, usually for less than $100.
You also don't need to cross a national border for this to be useful. For instance, the M-PESA system is only for Kenya, but is used for sending payments to rural areas from the city and vice versa.

Coinapult holds 100% backing for all Locks positions. This means if you have 1 USD Locked, we are holding 1 USD to back the Lock. If you have 1 oz of gold Locked, we are holding 1 oz of gold.
Coinapult does not hold a net long or short position using customer funds. We hedge each transaction completely to eliminate our exchange rate risk. Whether the price goes up or down has no affect on our ability to provide Locks.

SMS transactions are off the blockchain. At Coinapult we make an entry into our internal ledger, as to who has claim on the Bitcoin.

Hi Chompy, this is Gabe with Coinapult, and this was my post. 
I think I was pretty clear in my post that I was only quoting the attending Israeli politician (Tamar Zandberg) and central banker (Dr. Edward Offenbacher). I probably should have named them, but I was aiming for brevity. 
I was told that official attendance was around 300 total for the 2 days, which seemed pretty strong to me, considering that Tel Aviv would certainly be a smaller venue than Amsterdam/Vegas/NY. 
Dr. Offenbacher is indeed only in the research dept. for the Central Bank, not an active regulator making day-to-day decisions. But considering he is the head of Monetary research, it still seemed significant enough to mention. And as you note, there was not a significant amount of media (though I don't believe it was zero), so I wanted to make sure someone pointed this out!
The paper that Dr. Offenbacher and Eden Shochat (Aleph VC) are putting together has not been released yet, but I would imagine more than a few Israeli politicians/regulators/bankers will read it when it is released.
I agree with you that Israeli politicians overall are likely to follow the international/US lead, however I thought it was very positive to see leaders in Israeli gov't / banking thinking more proactively.

It would be hard to say that they won't profit from the event, as I think every single person on the island will profit from it quite literally. That being said, we have no special agreement for payments to the government or any of its officials.
We've simply had lots of good dialogue about the potential for Bitcoin and how it can stimulate the local economy. I think they understand that a rising tide raises all ships.

This is the international re-launch of our original service. It was previously available in the US and Canada, only. We recently decided to block the US from the majority of our services, and had to temporarily disable the service while we redeployed. This was not a big sacrifice, as the service is targeted at the developing world. We have a lot more work to do before it can be really useful anywhere, though. Look forward to new nodes in dozens of countries next year.

You are blatantly ignoring the fact that most phones in the world are not capable of making an HTTP or XMPP request. This same security model is used for billions of dollars worth of transactions around the globe today. If you are not comfortable with it, stick to traditional bitcoin wallets, like our web-wallet with 2fa. As a relatively wealthy person, that is your privilege.
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:21:27
Yes bitcoind3, that is correct.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:21:02
Coinapult hedges using the market making software we have spent years developing and refining. When a user creates a lock or unlock, Coinapult's software makes corresponding trades to ensure that our position stays neutral.
During a Lock, the funds are stored in traditional accounts (type depends on Lock asset), not on exchanges. We will do quarterly audits of these funds, and are in talks with insurance partners to provide greater peace of mind.

Congrats on setting up your business with Bitcoin! If you are worried about price volatility, you can use our Locks service to accept payments. Here is a 2 minute guide:

It is true that Locks are not redeemable in anything but bitcoin, which is an advantage some networks have. In these cases, though, the transactions are not settled peer to peer, but rather by a token to real asset exchange like Bitstamp. By the way, who will send you gold?
I will update the asset list, which is indeed out of date. It might take a little as it is an image not a simple table (thanks medium). I didn't want to get into cryptocurrency support, but was rather trying to compare the use for centralized assets.
Protocols are intended to allow communication between various clients. Anyone who uses bitcoin can transact back and forth with anyone who uses Locks. This is not true for any "Crypto 2.0 networks".
@_date: 2014-07-29 09:10:53
The service is designed to be used anywhere a stable balance is needed, for example wages, savings and rent payments. The balance can be locked and unlocked as needed from within the wallet interface without the need to get set up on an exchange. 
We think it's a rather handy tool that will have utility for people who perhaps aren't buying Bitcoin for speculative reasons.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:55:43
These are not materially different. The only difference is protocol.

Yes, this is unlike any other SMS service available in that it can exist as a standalone system. Once bitcoin is circulating via SMS there is no need for the internet to continually provide in/out points - which is the case for most SMS services. It can run as it's own ecosystem if you like. It's very exciting.
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:54:52
Our BTC to SMS service re-launched today and needs no internet or data plan opening the currency up to some 4 bill people. Our full range of tools, including Locks, can now operate entirely via txt and from the most basic of mobile phones. The possibilities are endless.

Well said. We at Coinapult provide similar services, and have explored this question thoroughly. The following blog post misread Bitsharesx's crazy plan, but the generic arguments still apply.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:27:16
There aren't really options on how to use this service, aside from not sharing your cell phone... Therefore there is nothing for us to prevent. The closest we can get is setting limits on transactions and encouraging website use when available.
International (and also local) SMS fees are a significant cost to us. It is incredible how much telecoms charge for sending a few bytes. Frankly, this SMS service is likely to be a loss leader. We think it is important to expand access to bitcoin in general and our other services in particular.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:19:00
Our partner Crypto Capital can accept any form of bank transfer, such as ACH, SEPA, or international wire transfer.
You can then transfer funds from Crypto Capital to Coinapult to purchase BTC.

I updated the table, but couldn't find any evidence for Ripple supporting many of the assets you listed. They weren't on  or in the google docs spreadsheet you shared.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:58:16
1. Yes, though the default limit is currently quite high (10 BTC). We will likely lower it.
2. We are not restricting access, except where we perceive legal risks. We believe in open access, not telling people how they should act.
3. The same way we're offering the service everywhere else... the development of the country has no affect on the technology.
4. We are considering a number of optional 2fa choices for SMS users. Most of these seem self-defeating, however, as it is unlikely the average SMS user has any secondary devices or apps available. For instance, on our website we currently offer 2fa through google authenticator. Clearly, though, anyone with google authenticator could (and logically would choose to) use our full website.
@_date: 2014-07-29 11:17:23
Not so, within seconds or minutes of a typical Locks transaction, we are fully hedged. The company does not expose itself to volatility issues, and so can guarantee we have the proper funds to operate, with 100+% reserves at all times. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 04:48:44
It works in every other country, at the moment. The obstacle is a regulatory minefield. Sorry, but the US is one of the most confusing and difficult places in the world to do business of this sort.

Who says we need to give away $35M for this to succeed? Dominica's GDP is around $500M. That means that a $5M drop would be a instantaneous 1% stimulus to their yearly GDP. Think about that. A similar stimulus to the US would be $140B or roughly 1/5 the size of TARP.

Oh, and murlidhara, just to point out, the $3,000 limit you mentioned is only per transaction. You can Lock up to $25,000 per asset (Gold, Silver, EUR, USD, GBP), for a total limit of $125,000.
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:19:41
Ashray, we operate on a 100% reserve basis, so a true bank run is not possible. Our prices adjust in real time to account for market liquidity events, and our spread can go up to 4% in extremely thin markets. While it is possible that we can have very short term liquidity issues as we wait for bank wires or similar, we are confident we can minimize this risk.
Furthermore, if such a thing happened, the natural result would be our index price rising, indicating our need for BTC, and other users would have a strong incentive to Lock. Basically, the price provides a self-correcting mechanism.

There are no fees, but there is a spread built in to the price. For a typical transaction (&lt; 50 BTC) the spread will be around 2%, meaning each Lock or Unlock action would be ~1% off of the market index.

This is proprietary technology, and we have not published the details of its functionality anywhere. It is pretty simple to understand, though. When you lock 1 BTC for gold, we sell 1 BTC and buy an equivalent amount of gold. When you want to unlock, we sell the gold, and purchase BTC according to the current market rate.
@_date: 2014-07-30 00:08:29
Great questions. You clearly have a firm understanding of finance. There are some small inaccuracies in your post, but I'll just address the underlying question.
Our price takes into account all exchange orderbooks, in addition to other BTC liquidity sources. If our partner exchanges didn't have enough BTC available, we would be driving their (and our) prices up. We try not to ever quote prices we can't fill 2x over. In the rare event that every exchange in the world continued to follow us and stay so thin we can't get an order in, our own price would increase to indicate the unsettled demand for BTC.
We do, of course, keep some of our own BTC and other assets on hand to lubricate this process, but it is mainly a question of price discovery, not liquidity.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:25:59
You are assuming a local transaction. What if I am in one geographic region and you in another? I can send to you digitally, instantly. What's more, if we are in different countries or using different currencies (i.e. one using EUR and the other USD) then this service is the glue that bridges our preferences.
@_date: 2014-08-28 21:08:23
We're going to set local shops up with the ability to accept payments, and we'll also put ATMs on the island. We have local help with this, and will make sure the business owners know how to use it. At worst, they accept bitcoin for a few days and change it out at one of the ATMs for EC$. I can't see how that would have a negative affect...
Personally, I first want to get the restaurants Calabash and Wen's (sp?), and the Anchorage Hotel onto Bitcoin. I spent some time at those places a few weeks ago and spoke to each of the owners about Bitcoin. They seemed open, but mostly didn't believe me when I said everyone on the island would be accepting it next year. We'll see what they say next trip. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:05:50
Bitreserve is working on a similar product, but their business model is very different. Coinapult charges no fees for any of its services, but there is a built in spread, which is typically 2% (1% per transaction, 2% round trip)

Your question answers itself. Locking is different from selling because you can't receive the Lock asset (say USD for example). A Lock is a bitcoin balance which varies with the price of USD. You can only spend your USD Lock over the Bitcoin network.

We support almost every country in the world. We don't have local phone numbers in all of them yet, though. We need to find good telecom partners in each market to do that.

Locks really is a great alternative to panic selling, speaking as someone who locked theirs yesterday at $230. Just send your Bitcoins to a Coinapult wallet, pick what asset you want to fix your bitcoins to and hit Lock, then, when the bitcoin price goes down, you're untouchable.

Thanks for the questions, they are indeed important to clarify.  
* Coinapult takes market action to hedge all Locks transactions.  We do this by either matching orders internally or settling immediately via exchanges.
* Coinapult operates on a 100% reserve basis and does not make loans or leverage customer funds.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:04:14

hi, this is Coinapult here. Locks is still in fact available to users, but we did change the text from "Lock" to "Convert" on the site. If you convert to USD or EUR or GBP, you are holding a lock. Users now additionally have the option to withdraw their lock into a Crypto Capital account. 
Users can also use Locks from an Android Mycelium wallet, or by using  on Telegram ;)

Hi there bitvinda. There are a number of benefits to using Crypto Capital.
For instance, you could indeed withdraw funds from Paypal/Stripe/etc to CryptoCapital. First, set up your personal/corporate acct with CryptoCapital. Then, use your provided wiring instructions as the settlement destination for your Paypal/Stripe/etc account. 
Once funds settle to your Crypto Capital acct, Coinapult's integration with Crypto Capital lets you fund your Coinapult account and purchase bitcoins all via API / web.

Hello homad. If customers would like to redeem their USD tokens for actual US dollars in a bank account, you need to create an account with CryptoCapital.co. 
However, if you are just locking bitcoins and then unlocking them, anyone can do so, whether 2 btc or 2,000 (our API can only price up to 10,000 btc, so dont try 10,001 btc!)

Hi Kilorat. The variable spread is only for extreme situations (liquidity, extreme volatility). Typically our spreads are on the low end of the variable (0.75% for &lt;50 BTC).
Our prices can be found in the Mycelium app. If you select Coinapult as the default price in your Mycelium wallet, you can constantly monitor the prices Coinapult is quoting. 
Agreed regarding your point about language, and being transparent with customers. So regarding the example you gave, if a user locked 1 BTC and then converted back, the user will receive .985 BTC back (assuming the BTC price has not changed). 
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:26:07

The Coinapult team is very excited about the possibilities Factom provides. Factom is well-designed, taking advantage of the strengths of Bitcoin, while also giving back by providing an appropriate outlet for non-transaction data.
The potential applications are numerous, and we are still exploring. At minimum, we plan to use Factom to publish regular snapshots of any customer assets in our custody. The term "proof" should not be used lightly, but with Factom and tlsnotary, we can finally approach meaningful proof of reserves.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:43:01
Sure, it was lower than our usual volume demands. We try to keep a minimum balance there to ensure fast withdrawal processing for users.
The specific timing of the withdrawal indicates that the hacker was there and waiting. Bitfinex took 2 hours to process the withdrawal, but as soon as it had 2 confirmations (~40min) the hacker made his move.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:08:47
The linked Google doc describes the details of last night's security breach.
To summarize, Coinapult has the situation contained and all funds (minus the 150 BTC withdrawn last night) are safe. Investigations are ongoing to determine the method of attack. Until we are able to determine and patch the attack vector, we will not re-enable our services. If this takes more than a few days, we will refund customers manually.
Updates will be published on our Facebook page, on Twitter and on our website.
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:09:44
Our most recent update has been provided in its entirety below and is also available at the following link.
**Mar 21th, 10:10 PM UTC: Log in re-enabled**
Coinapult systems are now available for customers to log in and see their balances. We have filed a police report and new servers were put in place with new credentials and more strict access requirements.
At this point, for security purposes, the system will not recognize deposits or allow withdrawals. This will be re-enabled as soon as we are fully confident in the integrity of the system, and the safety of users to receive their transactions.
There are no indications the database was compromised, but we have taken extra measures as a precaution. Transaction history is not available and all existing API keys were dropped. Users with 2fa (two-factor authentication) are strongly recommended to disable and re-enable with a fresh 2fa. The system uses the transaction history to recalculate and verify balances. Although there isn't evidence that it was modified, the attacker could have modified it in subtle ways to credit or debit user balances. If you feel something is wrong regarding your balance, please email us and we will provide your complete transaction history.
Coinapult would again like to extend a sincere apology to our users for all of the inconvenience this incident has caused. We are working hard to ensure safety of funds, and to provide access as soon as possible.

Hi Crowley. Coinapult's API allows for ECC-based authentication. This means that each individual wallet user will have their own Locks account registered with Coinapult (via API keys), without requiring a username/email/etc. This will make signing up convenient, secure, and private. Providing an email address is optional, but useful for customer support. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:58:51
At Coinapult, we believe strongly that both Bitcoin (payment network) and bitcoin (asset) are here to stay. That is why we choose to make our Locks service spendable over the Bitcoin network, using valuable bitcoin tokens.
Without the network, both bitreserve and Locks would not be any different from many traditional solutions. Without the bitcoin token, the Bitcoin network cannot function, and our services cannot interact with the rest of the internet economy.
While it is true that services like ours can be helpful to users wishing to protect their bitcoins from price swings, no one is going to replace or forget bitcoin. At least, not until a truly, fundamentally better cryptocurrency comes along. It sure won't be DollarCoin, or any other type of FiatCoin though!
@_date: 2016-07-09 00:47:16
The easiest method for customers to use the kiosks was to allow users to send to an email address. Once users receive their email from Coinapult, they can create their Coinapult account and redeem their bitcoins to any bitcoin address.
