Yeah, I'll do that.

Hardware wallets. I suggest KeepKey or Trezor.

I'm sure some of his predictions were off, but in "The Internet of Money" he talks about how he thinks we'll use multiple different cryptos for different situations in the future.

Fuck your Lambo, I'm getting a Tesla.

I own a bitcoin "art wallet", that essentially has a public QR and then privkey under a tamper proof sticker. I think it's pretty cool. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:11:32
I don't think he's ever predicted altcoins will die..

How the fuck did I miss this song? I've been repping Strange Music since middle school /and/ it's about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:46:49
What was the name of the wallet..?
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:16:41
Fair enough! 
@_date: 2017-05-03 05:08:20
Public keys are derived from private keys, so I mean, he does answer it.

I admire your patience.

Have you gambled with it?
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:03:17
True HODLers are like "what pump?"
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:18:35
I'd take a pizza, man. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:19:16
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:52:45
Near impossible with tx fees though
@_date: 2017-05-03 02:46:56
Fuck this is fire

You may be downvoted because you're continuously saying you get downvoted. Gets annoying quick.

Yes, any instance where the privkeys are lost. 
Perhaps there will be in 30 years. I'm sure the sailors who lost gold at sea NEVER expected their merch to be recoverable. Now humans can bring oxygen into the ocean and recover the gold. We'll see. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:21:45
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:12:12
To the left. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:01:56
Correct. However the math behind that is a bit more than I want to drop on someone just starting to grasp the decreasing supply. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:19:52
Hahaha "apparently". 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:31:51
There's no company to invest in. Bitcoin is a protocol separate from any business. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 20:09:39
I don't have a fiat price I'm selling at, but I want it to contribute to a house / property.

What a sweet bot
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:57:38
Only ~16 million are in existence right now. Once we hit 21m there will be no more block rewards. 
Keep in mind, not all ~16m are under active possession. Some are lost. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:12:11
Honestly how I feel sometimes.
