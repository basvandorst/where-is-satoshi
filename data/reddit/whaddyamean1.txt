What will you do after you’ve sold on Bithump?

It seems to be in a minor dip in part due to CBOE and CME futures being around the corner. There's been a pump of alts which suggests that people are moving their investments around out of fear thereby (in part) causing the dip. We don't know what's going to happen come Monday--it could jump it could dip lower...it could stay the same. Overall, I'm betting on it rising (even if it dips at first) to new heights--but that's purely speculative. 
You could always buy some now and some later.

It is mania, recently. I've been getting more nervous with the increase than the decrease.

This is plausible.

I'm fairly new to crypto, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I've been steadily exchanging USD for bitcoin (also ETH and Litecoin) over the last few months. As to whether it's a good idea to invest in crypto--I think it's gambling like any investment--but more like investing in penny stocks due to the high risk/high payoff potential (I grant that there are lots of disanalogies, too). My system, for better or worse, is to invest about 7% or so of my overall worth--money that I wouldn't love losing, but which wouldn't change my life in a significant way. If it pays out like I'm hoping it will--then awesome. If not, then I keep on keeping on. 
As to how I've gone about exchanging/buying and storing: 
I started with Coinbase both for storage and exchanging/purchasing. But you should know there are considerable turn around times particularly when you first get started. There are weekly purchase/sell limits (note, if you desposit X amount of dollars from your bank account this will count against your weekly purchase limit), and you're getting your coins from a middle man in a sense (hence the higher "purchase" prices and high fees), which takes about a week to hit your wallet from the time of purchase. Further, instead of buying from your bank account you can deposit/transfer money from your bank account to the coinbase fiat wallet. This is free, and has the advantage of avoiding fees when buying coins (more on this below), but it also takes about 5 or so business days in my experience even though they take it out of your bank account within a day or so. 
Eventually, instead of buying coins straight from my coinbase account, following the advice of others, I started to deposit funds into Coinbase from my bank account and then transfer them over to GDAX, where by using limit orders (as a "maker"), I was able to avoid transaction fees (and purchase at a lower price than had I done it via the Coinbase interface---yes I know, they are owned by the same company). GDAX and other exchanges, take a little getting used to, but there are videos available which explain the basics. From GDAX, I transfer them back to my coinbase wallet (which is also free of fees)--since my goal is to HODL. This is a good method at least if you don't might having money sitting in your Coinbase fiat wallet--but again it takes 5 business days to get money deposited into your Coinbase fiat wallet--though the transfer to and from Coinbase to GDAX is instant in my experience. 
To work around some of the limitations with Coinbase, like weekly limits and turnaround times, I've also opened a Gemini account. They have lower (yet more complicated) fee structures, but what I like about their system is that when you initiate a bank deposit into the exchange, you get an instant credit for that amount. The weekly limit so far has been $500/business day. So you can start picking up coins right away--though you won't be able to move those coins or sell them until the withdrawal from your bank account has been cleared (3-5 business days). Since Coinbase has been my place of storing coins, I transfer what I purchase from Gemini to Coinbase. 
Overall, I've not been happy with Coinbase and their customer service. Hence, Gemini is a welcomed new venture for me at least as it concerns exchanging.  
My most recent purchase was in a cold storage wallet called the Ledger Nano S. I'm not particularly savvy, but I've just set it up and found it to be easy to use. I will soon move all my coins to it since again I'm a HODL. I don't suspect Coinbase to go down or lose my coins--while it's certainly possible, it's an unlikey event. But I also think that a small investment of $80 or so dollars in a hardware wallet and the small amount of time it takes to move my coins to the Ledger is a small cost to pay for the added assurance that I've got the keys in hand. Of course, it's possible I lose my Ledger (which would suck, but wouldn't mean I lost my coins) or far worse: that I somehow lose my recovery phrases (deeming my coins unrecoverable), but my thinking was that I've done a good job of keeping important documents (e.g., social security card, passport, marriage certificiate) over many years--so I'll just stick the pertinent info along with them and hope that I've made a good inductive inference. 
I doubt this counts as an expert opinion, but I think most of what I say is true. Cheers and welcome!

One question I've had about this is why and to what extent we should expect current btc developers to remain btc developers. All this recent talk about market manipulation has focused on Whales and to a lesser extent miners--but developers seem to have a lot of control as well. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see how developers might jump ship, withhold tech, and the like to make a profit.

If it's true that the big money has got special ways of buying/selling and the main exchanges for us commoners keep going down at key junctures, this is really worrisome.

Which exchanges are up right now? I can't get into gdax, nor gemini.

The "drop" so far is to 7,500+. Zoom out.

tragedy of the commons...

I think you left out a 'not' in your response.

Yeah I'm far more stressed now than with the recent "dip" after the no Segwit2x news. Weird how that works.

hodl me, i'm scared, too.

And here it comes. Although by the time you see this it might be going back down and then back up and then back down again.
