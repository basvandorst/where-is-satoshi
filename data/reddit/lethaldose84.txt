Because there are 2^(256) private keys and 2^(160) addresses. So each address have on average about 2^(96) private keys that can spend BTC from it: [
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:41:29
2^(160) x 2^(96) = 2^(256) (a bit less)
1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,975 x 79228162514264337593543950336 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,852,837,564,279,074,904,382,605,163,141,518,161,494,336
So each 2^(96) key for each address is in different 160 block up to the FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364140. Tnx, finally I fully understand it now.

Ty, great answer.
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:13:38
Yes that is what I thought there.
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:06:31
sure XD

This is what I found and that is why I am asking: In cryptography, it is considered good property of every hash function if it evenly distributes the values in its codomain. Because the codomain of the SHA256 function is the domain of the RIPEMD160, we can expect the 2^96 valid private keys to every address also to be evenly distributed in the 256bit search space, each on average in a block of 160bit size.
So I was just wondering does some1 knows more about this or even is this true at all.
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:36:25
I didn't mean half of 2^256 . I mean in blocks of 160bits.
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:06:50
I red somewhere that we can expect 2^96 private keys to be evenly distributed in the 256bit search space, each on average in a block of 160bit size, that is why I asked.
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:16:13
Well I red that since RIPEMD160 is codomain of SHA256 that that those 2^96 keys should be distributed evenly in blocks of 160bit size. Ofc I don't know is that the case or not, that is why I asked.

I saw this other day but I cant find more info [
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:12:58
yes they are

Well I think I did it. There is a guide here also for Windows: [
So now my chainstate dir is on SSD and I used  *mklink /D chainstate ?:\\path\\to\\chainstate* command which created a symbolic chainstate dir on HDD. Now I need to wait for few h and try to sync and see will it be faster, atm I am up to date with blocks. When I start bitcoin qt I can see that it is using chainstate dir from SSD because symbiotic dir in HDD has no size at all.
@_date: 2019-12-22 22:39:59
Ty mate, just tested it and it sync's A LOT faster, amazing :)
@_date: 2019-12-22 17:02:35
Wow I did not knew this. Can you help me a bit more how to do this so I don't mess this up. Do you just move chainstate dir to SSD, or do I make fresh Bitcoin core install on SSD and link it to blocks dir on HDD? I'm on Windows btw.
@_date: 2019-12-23 09:48:25
Tested now with 12h behind on blockchain. It works A LOT faster now, before it was 30 mins sync on HDD = 2 mins sync on SSD now, crazy.
@_date: 2019-12-12 13:03:12
There are 2\^256 private keys and 2\^160 addresses, that means each address have \~2\^96 private keys that can hash to that address and spend funds from it. All private keys should be uniformly distributed in 160bit blocks (1 key per block per address). That means to 'guess' private key for one given address you have 1 in 2\^160 chance (1 in 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,975).

Not your keys, not your coins. Kraken could be hacked like any exchange. You will not go wrong with ledger or trezor. I would just avoid using ledger live and trezor software because their servers have full info on your wallets. Current best ways to use HW wallets:
1. Electrum + Electrum Personal Server
2. Wasabi Wallet + Bitcoin Core Full Node
3. Samourai Wallet + Dojo

Transferring chainstate dir to SSD did the trick, it is so much faster now.
@_date: 2019-12-22 17:32:57
Yea I am considering ubuntu but I am also gamer so I still did not actually do it. Will search online a bit how this can be done, and will consider getting separate PC for a node. I also do not run node 24/7, I mostly use it with Wasabi wallet when I need it (CJ, HW support, TOR) because now Wasabi connects to bitcoin core easy.
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:19:56
Cheers I love it, ty 1 more time. Btw any idea when Gui will get full HW wallet support?
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:51:44
yea, I really hope so

You haven't lost until you sold, BTC will come to new ATHs.

Try ENJIN mobile wallet, works amazing
