This video was made to make awareness on how hard it is for independent music artists to make a living from the small amount of money they get from the major streaming services. Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Pandora, and others make it impossible for hardworking artists to make a living for something they love to do. Bitcoin Lightning will be the revolutionary way to bring the power back into the artists hands. Think of it as Napster 2.0, but this time the artists will get paid directly from the consumer. 
1. Scalability + Speed
2. No More 30% cut to streaming services
3. Censorship Resistant 
4. Own your own data + security 
5. Sell merchandise without high credit card fees 
6. Sell concert tickets without high processing fees
7. Release of exclusive music (like a Patreon)
8. Utilizing nodes and channels to create a music label 
9. Smart Contracts so that writers, producers, etc get paid
10. More $$ to artists = better quality music 
Currently Feedbands.com is the only service that pays artists in Bitcoin. If you know of any other projects involving Bitcoin Lightning with music please let us know.
