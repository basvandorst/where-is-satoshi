I agree offline, BUT you should still create your own random private key and not trust the program to generate the private key. On the wallet details tab you will see the option to enter a BC6 number as the private key. That means a base 6 number that is 99 digits long. So, you can roll a dice 99 times and record each roll as a 1,2,3,4,5,0 (6 is set =0). Then enter those 99 digits in base 6 as your private key. Bitaddress.org will then convert the base6 private key to the Base58Check private key, as well as give you the public address. Dont trust computers to give you random numbers. Trust dice to give you random numbers.

It will be interesting if we test that 3k low again. It should serve as a very big resistance. There are a ton of people out there thinking just like you (mad at themselves for not buying at 3k about 10 months ago). But in the end, us little people probably don't matter. The whales will push the price around according to their plan and hopefully we will see a good chance to scoop up some more too.

"a cold wallet and hardware wallet are equivalent". No. A true cold wallet is generated offline on an air gaped computer that will never again touch the internet. It uses true randomness (for example flipping a coin 256 times or rolling a 6 sided dice 99 times) to give you a random private key. A hardware wallet uses a computer chip that you trust to create randomness with some kind of entropy sources. Computer chips are by definition deterministic and can never give you true randomness. Also some hardware wallets (like Ledger) are not open source and as such you do not know fully whats going on inside.

Sorry, the image you have shown is not the official Swiss flag. The Swiss flag is a perfect square, not a rectangle which you have shown.  The civil ensign of Switzerland (i.e., used by Swiss ships and other non-government institutions) is however often rectangular with the rectangular proportions of 3:2. But thank you for sharing anyways, its the thought that counts :)

Sorry, I can't help you with this. But I can suggest that in the future, always verify (decode) the raw hex bitcoin transaction after you sign it BUT before you broadcast it. There are several raw transaction decoders available, some even work offline such as in Coinb.in  . Its best to verify with 2 or 3 decoders to ensure that the transaction will do exactly what you want before you broadcast it.

Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not sure. But the Stuxnet virus is transferred to the offline unconnected computer using a USB. As such the method that true purists prefer (such as Andreas A) is to transfer everything to and from the offline computer using QR codes only (no USBs). Introducing a virus to an optical QR code is not possible since it is easy to review and even decode the QR code information before it is transferred to the offline computer. But again, I could be wrong.

Yes, agreed. Longer term I am also looking to see if the beta of BTC will somewhat converge to that of gold. This for me will be a partial verification of the "digital gold" thesis. We are on the same page.

I believe what you are looking for in a more general sense is the beta parameter of how Bitcoin correlates to, for example, the S&amp;P500. An item (like a big tech company stock) that is strongly correlated with the market has a beta value of slightly larger than 1. An item like gold that is opposite correlated to the market, has a beta of near -1. A quick online search shows that Bitcoin has a beta in the average range of 0.1 to 0.3 to the S&amp;P500 which means Bitcoin is almost uncorrelated to the stock market.

LOL. No.  You should check numbers before randomly throwing uneducated information out. The Beta you cite is based off of 3 YEARS of information. Try checking the Beta over the past 30 YEARS. Both gold and stocks have been around for a while :)
