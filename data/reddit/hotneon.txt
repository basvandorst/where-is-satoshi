I get it. I'm not saying o disagree. I'm just saying it seems suspicious if you're trying to smuggle a load of gold out of the country and its true owner doesn't come forward when it's found. I just think it's unreasonable to suggest it is connected to crime
I know there is a huge issue in the US about civil forfeiture but we don't really have the same issue in the UK
@_date: 2019-07-21 12:50:28
You need an export license for such a huge amount of money. Not getting one is reason to think it's criminal

I don't think we can blame may entirely. She is being held hostage by the right wing of her party. Tough to negotiate if you aren't allowed to make any concessions and the only thing "acceptable is total domination of the other party. Especially when they have most of the power

Company invested in bitcoin says bitcoin is important. Shocker

I'm thinking US stocks/ dollar. It's not perfect but should go up in any outcome

Surly this isn't real

Love Harry Enfield. Fun fact he and Paul Whitehouse (also in the video) were actually decorators before getting their own TV show

In the UK these machines have zero fees. They are paid for by the banks.
I do see the occasional ones with a fee. For example in a bar or casino but just on the high street they are free. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:23:12
It's done
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:22:16
No. They should be charged in the country they are in
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:13:33
We aren't talking about a murderer. We're talking about a journalist publishing true information that embarrassed a country they are not from

@_date: 2019-04-11 14:01:50
So why are the US able to charge him? 
He committed no crime in America, he isn't bound by their laws surely.
im sure the answer will be some legislation somewhere but no one has pointed this out
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:31:01
That is where he is now. The US want him for publishing information classified by the US government. 
Where was he when he was publishing, recieving this information?
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:51:17
Yes but it doesn't say he was in the US. Chelsea Manning could have emailed it, or travelled.
A private citizen of another country in another country shouldn't be subject to US laws. It isn't up to Assange to keep US government secrets.
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:27:29
Honest question. Was he in the US when this happened?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:34:17
Interesting. Thanks

Thanks Captain Pedantic. 
You've saved the day once again
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:34:05
Obtuse much?
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:27:14
So this is a massive issue then?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:47:31
So this is real?
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:34:22
How so?
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:51:42
Perhaps there wasn't as much scrutiny in 2014. Now the whole world is looking at bitcoin. Not everything is FUD. Even if this example isn't an issue the potential for future issues needs to be addressed
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:41:28
That makes sense but surely it is now an issue.

This was more my concern than anything. Child abuse legislation is rightfully vary broad. 
Could someone be accused of having child pornography just by having a copy of the Blockchain?

Even in the UK. The bank of England set the rate and the government have no authority to overrule. The governor of the BoE even has a fixed ten year term to stop the government sacking someone that won't do what they say

Endless forks
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:37:19
I agree seeing these things
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:58:23
Although. The more times an organisation has freedom/people/democratic in its name the more chance it's bullshit.
