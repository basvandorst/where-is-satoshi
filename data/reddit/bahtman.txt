There are differences between centralization and centralization. The kind of centralization you are referring to is strictly topological as opposed to the kind of centralization that exist in cash flow today where one instance, a bank say, gain major influence over your funds when you connect to it. The LN-centralization discussion emerged from a time where LN functionality were purely speculative and no man knew exactly how it would work. I'm surprised we are still discussing this. I say the small amount of centralization we'll have in the LN network is not that bad, you connect to (some of) the services you use, and if any tx path leads through one large player your payment will just take another route if that player disappears, as long as you have more than one channel. The large player gets basically nothing out of this so comparing banks to nodes with many connections isn't really fair. At least not yet.
There should be incentives against having _ONE_ channel though, that stupidity we can build around.

Hey guys! 
Try sending me some testnet btc. Already tried sending myself and it seems to be working so-so at least. 
Heres my pubkey:
and an invoice:

`I f-in knew it`
Bye USDT wizard bogus shit money

Its not a premium if you've got different base assets... `USD` and `USDT` are two different things
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:30:17
Err. That's not the same thing.

Every channel holds a certain amount of funds, the figure is just the sum of funds over all channels.

If anything the price should increase a tiny bit since people are losing btc forever ;)

I used this:
BUT! There are several pitfalls in that "guide". For instance; copy-pasting from that document into cmd/code will cause errors, I think its some type of LaTeX-formatting on medium.com maybe. 
"go install . ./cmd/…" should be "go install . ./cmd/..."
"rpcPort: “8334”" should be "rpcPort: "8334"". 
Do you see the difference? I didnt. So double-check everything you copy-paste. 
Further the guide gives the impression one uses the BTC-core wallet inside the LN-network and this is not the case; so one have to do &gt;lncli create before one does &gt;lncli unlock - also the syntax is lncli, not ln-cli; as stated in the guide. 
And so on and so on.
If you decide to use that guide, try sending me a pm if you get stuck, maybe I ran into the same problem. 
And also, as always - you must be prepared to loose some btc doing this.

Amazing post, I respectfully agree with almost everything you are writing here.
It is clearly unwise to have a syllable of the base unit (it's bitcoin, get real) to equal something else than one bitcoin. 1\*bit\*10^8 = 1 bitcoin. wtf, since when does coin = 10^8 ?

Well, not really. For instance, do you think the creator of the recksplorer have connections to all the nodes that do not have channels open at all? 
The data used to generate that version of the recksplorer does not update at all.

I too could make a homepage that automatically fit polynomial functions to curves and call it forecasts.
