I'm not super informed on taxes. If you get compensated in something other than currency for work, are you supposed to pay taxes on property gain or do you not pay unless you trade it in for currency? Also if the latter is true, does it count as income tax or sales tax?

The reason I have so much value in bitcoin today is because I started buying on a regular basis back when the price was very stable. The reason I bought back then was because rather than getting rich, I planned to use it as a convenient way to buy things. I still care more about buying things than seeing the price skyrocket.

I don't like the idea of reversing a transaction without the consent of the recipient.
I could see maybe using an escrow service for that maybe.
I could also see having an "intent to transact" signal. You signal a wallet that you want to pay it a certain amount, then the recipient in real life contacts you and confirms that it's the right amount to the right wallet. Then you finalize the transaction.
Or vendor codes, where someone sets their wallet to expect a specific amount with a one-time code, and if you send the wrong amount, or you send to a wallet not expecting the one-time code, the transaction does not process.

Of course they can still get you if you aren't good at concealing your crypto.
And that fear is the point of the law. They want to scare us out of owning crypto-- specifically those of us who are law abiding. Because a law like this certainly isn't going to stop drug dealers who already have a place reserved for them in prison. It's easier to conceal crypto than it is to conceal an illicit drug cartel

I've always wondered why tulips became worthless, and whether it's reasonable to expect a similar fate for Bitcoin.
I can foresee a huge crash, sure, but those of us who aren't in it just to get rich quick probably won't sell all the Bitcoin they have, so the price can't completely bottom out, right? I think Bitcoin's natural utility (not to mention lack of expiration) would give it some inherent worth that would keep some value in place.

Here's a fun question. If you trade BCH for Bitcoin, how do you pay taxes on it? Does it count as increased value for the Bitcoin you held when BCH came into existence? Or do you just mark it as a purchase at 0 dollars and pay tax on the entirety of the new value?

What seems to be confusing me is the fact that the market sets the value of bitcoins. For instance, the more people that buy BTC, the higher the value becomes, and therefore what you used to buy with a couple thousand bitcoins, you can now buy with a fraction of one. I would have thought this can continue infinitely, letting the value increase forever, and letting the "every day spending money" find itself measured in smaller and smaller units.
I'm sorry if I sound ignorant on this, but I'd be fascinated if I could really understand it.

I'm still wondering when bitcoins are going to stabilize, because at this point they're just investment tokens. In order to use them as currency, they have to not change in price wildly. You don't want to buy two pizzas for 20 bucks only to have that turn into 6 million dollars in value. Conversely, you don't want to take a payment for 500 bucks and have the value drop out on you.
In order to use Bitcoin as a currency, it has to have a stable value, and in order to have a stable value, it has to essentially be used as a currency-- it has to be commonly exchanged for goods and services that themselves have a value.

And if Net Neutrality turns out to be a bad deal, it will be yet another one of those laws we can't roll back. That's why we need to be taking our time on this.

There's still some difference between typical currencies and bitcoins.
Otherwise how do you explain spending 10,000 BTC on pizzas only for that to increase in value hundreds of thousands of times over? Maybe that's POSSIBLE with regular money, but not expected. So what has to change so that we can expect such a thing not to happen again to bitcoins? Because as a bitcoin holder, there's no way I'm going to just spend it when I know I could right now be paying small sums that in the future might be thousands of dollars. Especially when we know bitcoins are rising in popularity and hinting at more increase in value.

So you're saying the government should have been getting involved in this in the first place? I was under the impression that your support of Net Neutrality was because solutions that *didn't* involve government weren't working.


You seem certain that not restricting internet fast lane business models will unquestionably cause limiting access to services. It seems like a possible risk, but for the sake of limiting our use of government regulations, why is it so bad that we act on facts later rather than predictions of doom and gloom now?

Most currencies try to avoid rapid inflation or deflation. With bitcoin markets as they are, inflation and deflation are half of the goal. You don't have people pumping in Euros to see the value of USD rise. That's just silly.
And it's not really circular logic. Despite what I said, it's not so much that one thing requires another, but that with one thing in place, the other would easily come about. As it is, we have to kind of work it into place by treating bitcoin as currency, even though it's a little bit shaky to do so at this point.

Just out of curiosity, do you guys think it's financially wise to convert a good amount of income to bitcoins in the case that the value of the dollar plummets and you can have some economic stability and not lose your life savings in a crash of the dollar? I'd be nervous to do such a thing with bitcoins fluctuating in value so much these days. If not now, is there a turning point or landmark where it WOULD be wise to do such a thing?
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:25:36
Okay, then let me clarify again. It's not that the value has to be stable, it's that you can't really use the coin as both an investment and a currency. Imagine if you paid for a coffee with stocks.

Japanese pronunciation is pretty simple.
Every syllable is a consonant (or pair of consonants) and a vowel, except sometimes 'n'.
Anything that ends in "a" is "ah" as in "bra"    
Anything that ends in "e" is "eh" as in "may"    
Anything that ends in "i" is "ee" as in "see"    
Anything that ends in "o" is "oh" as in "blow"    
Anything that ends in "u" is "oo" as in "shoe"

First of all, I totally agree. This isn't to argue you. The country is supposed to be "of and by the people". Your acceptance of societal rules is assumed because of the condition that you have some say in what those rules should be. This made a lot of sense when the U.S. population was a lot less than 300 million. Now your voice in the government is negligible, and the government itself is using that as an excuse to take the reigns for itself. This is why we need to get back to small government values.

However, they said that mortgage interest is so much lower than the returns from Bitcoin, I might pay less in interest, but I'd have less overall by the time the loan is paid off.
Of course, that's assuming Bitcoin continues to rise. I think I'm willing to take that risk for now, because I took on this loan with the full intent to pay it off myself anyway. I've never made any financial decisions expecting Bitcoin's predictability to back me up.

I mean, the US doesn't track every transaction, so you can get away with having totally anonymous Bitcoin for a while, but the more you buy stuff without reporting it on your taxes, the more you risk being being caught with an excess of untracked wealth and jailed for tax evasion.

I know a 16 y/o who made a pretty complex and good looking php-based MMO style game. I was just a couple of years younger than him and pretty jealous that I wasn't nearly that good at his age. That did inspire me to try to make a similar game of my own, though, which taught me a lot about PHP and ultimately got me started along my future career of web development.
So I'm still pretty impressed at how far along one can be at age 16 when I compare them to myself at that age.

At this point I literally can't lose money even if it goes to zero, because the value of things I've bought with Bitcoin exceeds the value of the cash I've put into it. Unit cost averaging makes this possible.

It depends what you're prepared to lose and when. For instance retirement investments tend to start out risky and calm down as you approach retirement age, when you really need to be sure your value won't drop wildly.
I tried day trading and then realized I'm bad at it. So I switched to buying $10 worth every two weeks irrespective of the price. I started around $300/BTC, so I could have gained a lot by over 10x, but instead, I've grown a collective 1k by about about 5-6x. I'm very happy with that, given the risk.

I'm not deeply involved with Bitcoin, so forgive me if I don't know what I'm talking about, but I own a small amount of BTC, and I've been watching the price shoot up and then settle way back down.
While, yes, it does feel like a major loss from the perspective of the $1,000 "moon", the value is still very respectable from the perspective of its humble beginnings. At the $1,000 mark, Bitcoin was sensational, but right now, the word that comes to mind is "utility". Bitcoin is no longer a treasure, it's a utility. I think this really isn't such a bad thing. Inflation is always disappointing, and we would all rather see it go up, and you're absolutely right that a more stable or increasing price would be better right now, but the price drop seems at least understandable to me, and I still expect it to improve again. It's slow going, but it will happen.

Prey* and yep until news about the scam spreads and it becomes ineffective. No need for regulation.


Keep in mind, you're assuming my research wasn't enough, which is a pretty hefty leap in itself. Without regulation, there will be a lot heavier scrutiny on organizations like these. Private "regulators" would appear that don't have the power to shut down everyone that doesn't kiss their boots, but could give a very meaningful seal of approval.
But even if I didn't fully trust it and scams were a real danger, I could get some sort of scam insurance. Point being your doom and gloom scenario is unrealistic, because so many things would exist to replace regulations that would be better for everybody.


And we know about that, and trust such reviews less as a result. Review organizations are subject to the same scrutiny because believe it or not, not everyone is completely stupid and helpless.

Socialism opposes humanity's self-serving nature and leads to abuse and stagnation. Capitalism harnesses that nature productively and fairly.
Socialism puts the power into the hands of a few corruptible central planners. Free market capitalism, like Bitcoin, allows participants to moderate each other.
Socialism requires greater and greater injustice as success is wrested from the ones who created it, and given to those who don't bother.
I care about wellbeing more than money too, but Socialism ultimately destroys both. The only economic system that has proved to improve quality of life even for the poor has been capitalism.

If I came across the two? The dollar would go first \*unpin\*.

Well by OPs logic, government regulation in general is bad because they screw everything up. So applying that to Bitcoin would be cause for concern.

Perhaps, but those facts really don't influence my opinion as they might influence yours. You seem to take issue with my qualification of one drug as less detestable as another because even though we see the same facts, we attribute different values to them.

The issues surrounding Bitcoin stretch pretty far. The threats to Bitcoin's free use due to regulation are pretty relevant in my personal opinion.

Considering the price hasn't gone up, and I'm otherwise ignorant of the ramifications of this, what makes it great for hodlers?

As a programmer we sometimes call it a bang.

I support freedom to do drugs and all, but I think people confuse that with support for doing the drugs themselves. I think it's detestable and I will never celebrate the availability and use of such things. As long as it's legal, that's all I care about.

I'm anti authority, but also anti-piracy.
Probably the least popular type of person on reddit.

He said in a thread celebrating marijuana sales based on the opinion that it is good. If you don't want to hear opposing opinions in a discussion, go to &gt;that's about where I put marijuana in the spectrum of things, so stop being a hypocrite.
That's not where I put it. Subjectivity is subjective. Let me have my opinion and I'll respectfully disagree while letting you have yours.

Still waiting for that tax reform there congress... Pretty sure that's what I asked you to do when I voted, not this...

Most who buy bitcoin don't wait for a few pennies of increase.
I buy on a fixed schedule for instance.

I recommend using priority by default. Most online services will assume the payment failed if it takes more than a few hours, and the regular fee takes like 24+ hours to confirm.

I buy all my bitcoin through Bitwage, so every time I get a paycheck, a portion of it gets automatically traded.
