Your argument is based on dismissing the basic methodology of all forensic science. I see.

If the standard is confession then we may as well throw out the criminal justice system altogether.
I am not saying it is certain that he is Satoshi. I'm saying let's lay off the kool aid for a minute and recognize that the evidence is compelling.
His acknowledgment of high level involvement. His technical background. His period of unemployment while the protocol was being developed. The testimony of his family. The name.
It's compelling. And anyone who can't at least admit that is most likely motivated not by a desire to find the truth, but some combination of groupthink, ideology, and self-interest.

What I'm saying is, who would be more inclined to lie? The person whose job it is uncover facts? Or a person already known to be committed to obscuring their identity?

1. Police confirmed he was quoted accurately and contextually. (
2. He claimed not only knowledge but involvement. High level involvement.
3. He is quoted as being unable to deny involvement in bitcoin. If you believe the misunderstanding line, perhaps you have more trust in authority than your interest in bitcoin would suggest.

That would only happen if he wanted to be identified. So we are left with the kind of evidence that forensic research can provide. Of course, this isn't to say the evidence is at this point overwhelming. But to dismiss it out of hand speaks more of an ideological commitment to anonymity than a balanced weighing of the facts.

That's right, he did say that. Is it really believable? Both the researcher and the police state that bitcoin was clearly the topic of conversation.

Or... he's lying. Which is exactly what you'd expect from someone who has protected their anonymity as closely as Satoshi.
