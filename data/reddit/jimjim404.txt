actually the foreground of the medical industry to deliver meds to patience is a perfect one to create legalization a thing.  Your are registered with whatever exchange and they know your age, name whatever, then your only allowed to purchase cannabis with btc!  this checks your age and such then a tiny little drone drops it at your window.  this works great because its just a naturally light thing to move around.
automated liquor stores, gas stations fast food...Hell you in one swoop would end the drug war...

Only till the 5th when people start jumping off to ride the wave, then right back up.  but whatever its going to hit 300 at least by the end of the day.

ur not lying i just saw a 2.6m  purchase on the tick...  its on till the silk road btc gets sold off.
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:21:54
Its not meant to, but only becomes more relevant when people jump off over 20 bucks on a coin...  so we ride the wave or wait till drop on the 5th...
