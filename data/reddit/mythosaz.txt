What **IF**?  
I did both, and they both made money.

The answer to that question is that I'm not sure it matters, or that you can (in my case) tell.
I sent them about $160 in BTC at the time, and then I immediately turned around and purchased $160 in BTC to replace it.  I was out $160 in cash...which I used to buy BTC.
I agree that they should offer a refund in the currency they accepted to fund the account, but it's largely moot to me.

I've recently purchased the smallest pool.bitcoin.com plan possible - just to see what happens.  I've done vastly dumber things with $130 in BTC.
I'll check back in 4 months and see if there's more BTC than what I spent.
