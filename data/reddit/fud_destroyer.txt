There is no harm that can come to Bitcoin Core nodes, regardless of their version. They will still ignore invalid blocks and ban the peers that relay them. So in effect, the forked nodes will end up getting banned instead of simply not connecting to you in the first place.
The annoying thing is that it will cause needless network churn and some partitioning until the nodes figure out who to talk to and who to disconnect from. It'll also cause some parasitic bandwidth consumption because they'll be able to leech block history from you until a certain point.
It just shows that the goal of this fork is to cause the maximum amount of disruption. Old Jeff isn't the brightest programmer in the world, but he knows how to cause disruption when needed.
p.s. I wrote a Python program that bans peers based on their user agent. Unless they fake that too, it's quite effective (faking their UA is shooting themselves in the foot -- they'd nullify their network presence and simply make it look like there are more Core nodes than there really are). Let me know if anyone is interested.
EDIT: the script is here

Protesting won't help because the civilizational rot has already started taking place, akin to gangrene. Even if you somehow remove the current iteration of politicians and replace them with a new one, it won't do a damn thing because these new politicians will come from the same rotten culture that rewards theft, laziness and irresponsibility that created the previous iteration.

I'm also an individualist but I've learned the hard way to never ignore history, culture and context. On average, doing business in Switzerland and Japan makes getting scammed a lot less likely than doing business in China. Needless to say, there are both good people and bad people everywhere and nothing is fully black and white.
Stereotyping is not good in general, but there's usually a grain of truth behind stereotypes (otherwise they wouldn't come into existence other than through concerted propaganda campaigns, but that's pretty rare on the nation-state level nowadays).
For instance, take the "ugly American" stereotype into consideration: are all Americans loud mouthed aggressive buffoons? Not at all, and none of my American friends are. But on average, when I see a group of American tourists in Asia, they're more likely to act crass and disorderly than their European counterparts.

They would if anyone actually used them. Fees increase linearly with adoption. The only way to mitigate it then is to sacrifice decentralization, at which point you may as well just use Paypal.

This can't be overstated.
There are several important reasons to run your own node. It gives you the ability to
1. verify your own transactions (many SPV wallets can be locked to a specific node)
2. keep the miners honest by verifying they are adhering to the inflation schedule and other rules of consensus
**SPV alone isn't enough** because you can't verify that the protocol hasn't been hard forked to something else! The big blockers want everyone to run lite wallets while they alone share the blockchain only between themselves and their data centers. If that happens you can't verify that the 21M coin limit hasn't been raised or the block reward increased! The conman Roger Ver and the charlatan Peter Rizun are the main proponents of this fraud.

I actually created an account because I saw your question and wanted to provide an answer. Does my account age invalidate the truth value of my response?
Now, back to the matter at hand: replacing the value being hashed is a cheap and fast operation. My question to you: why wouldn't they do it if there's only an unequivocal monetary upside to doing so? Not doing it amounts to leaving money on the table (and harming Bitcoin by not picking up transactions). Unless.... they have a covert advantage that makes them more money than mining honestly in the first place, which is exactly what ASICBOOST is.

You are a very naive individual. You seem to be unable to see past the immediate.
Raising the block size to 2MB won't do anything useful for Bitcoin. It may provide a very tiny relief in terms of fees, that's all. The real goal is to remove the Core devs and install businesses and miners into power so that they can dictate what the protocol is going to be in the future.
I can't tell if you're really that naive (I don't wish to say stupid), or if you have ulterior motives.

A full node is not necessarily a wallet. In fact, that functionality is being phased out of Bitcoin Core. Dedicated wallet software should use the bitcoin daemon as its "source of truth".
While not exactly practical, you could have used Electrum with your Ledger and pointed it to your own Electrum server which in turn points to your Bitcoin Core node.

I have to agree with the other poster. We live in a world defined by existing laws and social contracts. Bitcoin doesn't exist in isolation, detached from that world. The EFF is not the government, they are friends of decentralization and freedom. Why wouldn't we ask them for help?
Bitcoin is still in its infancy and needs to be nurtured and taken care of until it grows up into a truly resistant system that no one can attack successfully. We can't just sit back and say "the market will take care of it" in the meantime.

The likeliest scenario (in my opinion) is that more signatories will walk away, the split will likely happen anyway, and the result will be similar to the current bcash situation where the fork is worth some fraction of a bitcoin.

You've pretty much nailed it. How Garzik is going about creating a hard fork while completely ignoring a very large portion of the community is extremely distasteful and arrogant. He's going Rick on everyone and he doesn't care what kind of damage he causes.
Core isn't perfect and above reproach (humans aren't perfect), but a lot more consensus building is required there if you want to push a change through. For example, Luke wants to reduce the block size to 300 KB. No one else wants it so it's not happening. Contrast that with Garzik and a few suits pushing 2X on everyone while refusing to implement basic replay protection, putting everyone's funds at risk.
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:04:30
Indeed, for "once in a lifetime" transactions it's not very useful. But if you intend on using Bitcoin again, the more transactions you do, the lower your fee gets (because you only pay for opening and closing the channel, but you could do thousands of transactions in the meantime).
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:59:43
That's because 2X has no real support, only an illusion of support. It's literally a couple of CEOs strong-arming the companies they invested in and trying to make it look like "95% of the market supports it".
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:45:54

It may or may not be one time. It's very likely an experiment in seeing if they can modify the protocol at will by making unilateral agreements behind closed doors.

I actually believe that individuals like Ver are highly dangerous and not above deploying real-world attacks on people they disagree with. Rotating accounts is just good opsec in these turbulent times and every statement should be evaluated on its own merit and truth value.
Luke is right in the post you linked, but that's a special scenario that applies only to very short time frames between receiving a newly mined block and calculating the next block template. It doesn't apply to the situation where Bitmain mines an empty block 5 to 10 minutes from the previous one. It simply doesn't take that long to make a new block template.
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:41:22
The same thing happened to the Tokyo meetup. A lot of normal people have been pushed away and alienated. At this point it's a cult centered around Ver and if you don't subscribe to their notions then you're not welcome there. They also aggressively promote bcash.
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:32:32
And if 2X somehow succeeds, cryptos are a non-viable concept because it'll have been demonstrated they are easy to hijack via social manipulation and aggressive lying. In which case, they will all converge to zero in the long term. That being said, I have almost my entire net worth in Bitcoin so it's clear I'm betting on Bitcoin's ability to fend off this attack.

Shitcoin traders have been wanting to sow chaos since day one and destroy Bitcoin, erroneously thinking it would raise the value of their shitcoins.

Says an rbtc anti-Core shill (just look at his post history).
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:53:58


Many "core devs" didn't even attend the HK agreement. Those that did could only sign on their own behalf, not for the entire community.


So that's the **only** thing? What about numerous community members who are rallying against 2X as a part of the NO2X grassroots movement? Or are we all paid shills on Blockstream and AXA's payroll?


You've just described what's happening right now. A large portion of the community said "NO" because they saw it as a political attack and don't like having things shoved down their throat and having their money hijacked by a bunch of ex-banker suits who have demonstrated a pretty poor technical understanding of Bitcoin time and again.
I'm sure a block size hard fork will eventually happen (as it needs to happen, up to a point), but it'll only happen with overwhelming consensus. It'll also be bundled together with many other upgrades that require a hard fork (there is now in fact a hard fork wishlist). Doing it willy nilly the way Garzik is doing it is not the correct way to go about it.
If you **really need** those big blocks **right now** (some people genuinely do, such as Erik and Roger, since they run online casinos), I'd advise you to use Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum in the interim.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:20:28
Well nobody said these people are very bright. They're thinking short term, seeing Bitcoin as a threat and responding to that threat.

And you've just discovered why Bitcoin can't handle multi-gigabyte (Visa scale) blocks without sacrificing the ability of non datacenter owners to run their own node and keep the miners and businesses honest.
Let me relax the initial statement a bit: I don't mean to say that every individual participant needs their own node, but one node per household or trusted community (neighborhood, circle of friends) might be more practical and realistic.

I agree. However, there has been some misconception on these forums lately where people believe that if they don't upgrade to 0.15 that they will end up on the wrong chain. I was just explaining how that's not possible as long as they run any version of /Satoshi.0.*.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:40:38
"Anarcho-capitalist" "captains of industry" such as Erik and Ver are ok with *the market* as long as they're the ones ripping someone off or making themselves rich by preying on someone's mental instability or addiction. When *the market* is doing something they dislike, then it's a "witch hunt", "coercion" and "censorship".
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:20:09
From what I've managed to glean, some of them seem to believe a corporate takeover of Bitcoin has already taken place ("Blockstrem-Core-AXA-Bilderberg"), so now "everything is permitted" in order to fire Core, a form of total war if you will. They really believe that Core are the hijackers and see themselves as freedom fighters.
Since they've based their entire belief system around an unprovable and unfalsifiable claim, I'm not sure what can be done to convince them otherwise at this point. Maybe they really do have to fork and lose money in order to give up. Not sure how fits into this, he appears honest enough in his posts, but then again we also trusted Ver and upheld him as some kind of Jesus some years back. It's hard to tell who's simply misguided and  who's manipulative.
I'm not sure about Erik, but gives off a rather machiavellian vibe and he seems to be highly intelligent and controlled (unlike Ver, who's an emotional dumbass), so his motives are hard to read. Either way, I don't trust him much.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:50:06

An expensive lesson is about to be learned, both monetarily and reputationally. do yourself a favor and save your reputation and back out of 2X. 2X is failing either way, but you still have the chance to be treated as a friend of Bitcoin in the future.

No more than the first layer requires. Anyone will be able to run a lightning node on a $50 Raspberry PI. At least it will be more profitable than running solely a full node, which many of us are already doing at a loss (or at least no profit whatsoever). If people can get paid to run full nodes, we can expect an increase in node count and therefore even more decentralization.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:02:11
 Fees increase linearly with adoption. The only way to mitigate it then is to sacrifice decentralization, at which point you may as well just use Paypal.

Wrong. PoW has to contribute to a valid chain, i.e. adhere to the existing rules of consensus. You don't just change the rules of consensus to whatever you want and call it Bitcoin.

the reason this community repeatedly keeps reaching out to you is because you've always been reasonable in the past and have never gone full extremist like Ver. At this point there is no doubt that Ver is a malicious actor who likely wants to destroy Bitcoin because he feels slighted by and other Core devs. He is not thinking straight anymore and he comes from a place of emotion, not reason.
But people have always seen you as a rational and reasonable actor and that's why they keep writing you open letters asking you to reconsider (whereas they treat Ver like a downright bad buy, which he is).
Please realize that there is no way this 2X business is good for Bitcoin. Don't divide the community further. We need to employ rationality and reason, not blindly follow some nonsense "agreement" that has been broken by the miners in the first place.
Please think about it. Even changing your position at this point wouldn't cost you anything in terms of future reputation because you'd be seen as a friend of Bitcoin and people would realize that you're a rational agent.

That's my take on it as well. Let them keep forking. The only thing it'll result in is masses of easily swayed emotional fools losing money. No skin off our nose in the long term.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:23:25
says we have to stick to our agreements, even if we find them harmful or silly later on. So we're doing it I guess.

They can use whatever the fuck they want for all I care. Most people don't and won't call that Bitcoin. Wait for November and see it for yourself.

At the time of that incident, he was at least a 90% owner (to my knowledge). What's factually incorrect about what I said?
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:14:59
So people do it because only because they might be trendy? Not because some of them are politically motivated or trying to send a message?

He said it in his debate with Richard Heart. Also said something similar in this video:

ViaBTC is a subsidiary of Bitmain. It's all one guy.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:51:00
is a petty criminal and conman and completely out of his league with legitimate mobsters like Ayre. I wouldn't be surprised if they compromised him at some point, assuming it hasn't already taken place.

Any financial benefits derive from not being defrauded by 3rd parties and the miners unaccountably debasing the money supply.
@_date: 2017-10-28 02:01:41
Why do you want Bitcoin to fail?
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:35:33
Sorry for your loss.

They were fired a long time ago when they started losing customer funds due to poor programming and flawed RNGs (it seems their engineers didn't/don't understand the basics of randomness and informational entropy).
Another failed company owned by the clown Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:52:04


**VERY** centralized indeed: over a hundred loosely affiliated developers stemming from all backgrounds, companies and continents.
Here's a piece of advice: if you don't like it, go use a coin developed by a very decentralized one-man development team (Garzik). Or BCH, developed by the very decentralized ViaBTC+Bitmain.

Thanks for the info. I suppose he's not a majority stakeholder anymore. I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:51:39
**DO NOT USE BLOCKCHAIN.INFO**: not only are they completely incompetent and ended up losing customer funds on many different occasions (due to the poor understanding of entropy and randomness on the part of their programmers), but Roger Ver also uses his stake in the company as a tool to deanonymize and attack the people he feels slighted by.
With solutions like Trezor, Ledger Nano S, Samourai Wallet, Breadwallet etc there is **NO REASON WHATSOVER** to use this poorly run company. I'd feel safer with my funds on Coinbase than Blockchain.

Let them do it. These companies are about to learn a very expensive lesson and their investors/shareholders are going to be very unhappy. I expect to see a few execs go after November.
Nothing quite like getting a financial beating to get capital to stop acting stupid.

People are routinely buying really nice countryside properties in rural France for around 150-200K. Tuscany would probably be in the same ballpark, and not to mention how much cheaper it is than living in a major city. You could easily retire on a mil there, though you'd have to forget about Lambos and hookers obviously.
Eastern Europe is even cheaper and 100K gets you quite a lot.

Is there any evidence indicating it's him? If there is, I'll be very excited to report that piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:43:35
Hypothetically is the operative word here. The idea is to establish a principle. I don't think there is ever going to be a chain with more SHA256 PoW.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:18:09
Where do you guys live that you can't retire on one million? Manhattan or central London? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:36:25
Everyone else? How about this [huge list of businesses]( opposing 2X?
Or how about the [100,000 Core reference nodes]( out there?
Who's "everyone else"? Roger's tiny forum and a few deranged malcontents and altcoin investors spreading BorgstreamCoreAXABilderberg conspiracy theories in it?
If you're gonna lie, you'll have to do a lot better than that to sway anyone.
This isn't about the 2 MB block size. This is about 1) getting rid of core devs, 2) setting a precedent for future hard forks that will likely affect the money supply.

Ver is a sociopath. No one normal can do what he does.

Luke has a family actually. Greg is married afaik.
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:38:55
Almost anywhere in continental Europe or Asia.
Why would you choose to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world? What does it offer that other places don't?
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:51:06
They already are. Mastercard is an investor in DCG, the industry cartel trying to hijack Bitcoin with S2X. Think about that for a second and let it all sink in.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:22:31
So Satoshi himself killed Bitcoin and created an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:05:44
Because he said so, so it must be true.
