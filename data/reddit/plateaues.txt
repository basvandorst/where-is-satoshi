One time I took 2 tabs of acid when it was doing this, I was *very* confused for a while, it also looked like the moon was filling up the whole sky, what was wild.

I remember everyone told me when buying bitcoin "use it ASAP otherwise you could lose money!!" That was at a mere 400 a coin. Ah well, I like to think purchases helped bitcoin grow even just a smidgen.  Never thought it would get 9k in just over a year

You're not way off, if you plan to buy more than $100 worth I would say definitely get a more secure web wallet at least.

I personally have experience with both bread and blockchain so I would recommend either of those!

Yes

If you are looking to spend that much I would recommend doing the research yourself, trezor or ledger are good options though

No, that much I would recommend hardware wallets
