Been holding but not sure how much more I can take!

It's not nice to call people dehydrated.

Sell, then buy more bitcoin at a higher price.

This guy gets it. So does Elon Musk.

What is this "hold" you speak of?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:06:52
You are stupid.

Normally I would say yes, however I'm starting to think that this is the beginning of it truly becoming mainstream. If that's the case then the only way is up imo.

It's only impractical for small transactions at the moment. That won't be the case once future upgrades, such as the lightning network, have been implemented.

If you define drugs from darknet marketplaces as 'day to day stuff', then yes lots of people are.

I would love to explain but unfortunately I also have no idea.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:42:23
Smart choice. Congrats!

How can you apply for a trademark on something that is open source?

Same lol

Buy a Trezor hardware wallet, can't go wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:34:50
Exactly, almost anything can be used in a positive or negative way.

If it is a Multibit HD wallet that you're trying to restore then I know how you can do it as several of my wallets became corrupted before I switched to using Trezor. You can use the seed in bread wallet, just download it onto tablet or phone.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:52:43
It'll go up, then down and back up again etc

I bought some at 5.5k.

No, relax and check back in an hour

@_date: 2017-10-29 22:50:20
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:44:27
Yes, get a Trezor or Ledger

Yes I had a problem with breadwallet and also with Multibit.
The way I fixed it was to install Simple Bitcoin Wallet onto my tablet and use the mnemonic from breadwallet to restore the account.
