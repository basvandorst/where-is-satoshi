while i still think there may be certain scenarios that warrant easy way outs, i see feeling desperate enough to commit suicide as a free pass to do whatever you want/need.  cause if that doesn't work out, you could always commit suicide...

that's quite the accusation.  care to cite any examples?

just what exactly is your competitor in?  
if you openly admitted you haven't done any recent programming, don't have recent professional IT experience, and don't understand the questions being asked to you it might be one thing.  if you were simply a PR guy and brought in someone who has a clue to answer questions then maybe people wouldn't be laughing at you.
instead, your solution is to avoid directly answering all questions and critiques of your 'whitepaper.'  you sidestep, spout buzzwords and bullshit, and reply with "i'll get this added to the whitepaper..  great questions!!"
it's so crystal clear to anyone who has *any* IT experience that you don't have a clue.  not even a little.  i don't know if your intent is malicious or not- and it really doesn't matter.  you've come to the wrong place to try and bullshit your way through a technical q&amp;a..

if you don't know how to identify a phishing e-mail you should probably stop using the internet..  imo, it should not be necessary to post/warn people in this sub of specific phishing e-mails.
