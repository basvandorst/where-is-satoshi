if you didn't get anything, you were an affiliate, pro associated with the site, or you screwed up the form. everyone else got paid. everyone.
edit: ok i guess some are still getting paid, but like i said, unless there was an "issue," you should be able to get paid. unless you were a pro or affiliate.

does anyone know much about xapo? i had never heard of them. i'd be weary of spending any funds on a card that has no agreement with MC or visa or any other processor for that matter. until they have a deal in place, spending $15 on this seems really stupid to me. how many companies have promised something and had preorders for bitcoin mining hardware or something bitcoin related, then not delivered?
again i know nothing about xapo so i might be off base, but i wouldn't spend $ on this, yet. it sounds awesome, obviously, but they don't have a deal w/ a processor yet.

stupid question. is there ANY incentive to an individual to run a node? i realize what you're saying, we depend on them. but do i gain anything from spending $$ keeping a node online 24/7?

tell them to quit discussions about the US dollar, because far more drugs are purchased with it than bitcoin. fucking idiots.

i stopped reading at "we agree that digital virtual currency businesses need regulation"
no idea why you think that

what good does this do? it's not like dogecoin will automatically be the sponsor of the car (btw it's not the "Nascar 2014 sprint cup on may 17th" it's the sprint showdown/all star race. his team would still have to have sponsorship guaranteed to even consider running in the showdown. if he doesn't run in the showdown, there's no chance he can be the fan vote i don't believe.

dems are just as spineless as republicans. the difference is republicans would almost always be against a technology like this, when all the word on the street behind it is it's used to buy drugs &amp; fund terrorism.
i expect more from both sides to be won over.

do any verizon wireless users in the US know if they have a lockout on your voicemail for wrong PIN  i have my PIN enabled and not on default. i assume if they have a lockout procedure, regardless of the site that uses 2FA, i should be OK to this particular exploit?

i'm not going to lie, the first 4-5 times i saw that article about trezor on the front page, i thought it initially was about trent reznor. i kept seeing it going "wait why am i reading about trent reznor on then i reread the title.
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:27:08
do you think your regulations are good for bitcoin? or do you realize you're just working for a bunch of rich bankers who want to continue to fuck over consumers? do you realize everyone here thinks you're a joke?

certainly not disagreeing with those points. maybe something should be done to give them incentive. there's lots of merit behind this post but not providing the avg user any incentive won't change the fact that there aren't that many full nodes.

there's about a 0% chance micon himself returns to fight this charge. there's a reason he went to antigua and it's because they won't extradite people on gaming related charges.

i don't think i've ever read an article and been MORE confused than i am now. i still have no fucking clue despite reading every comment here what is going on inside of this place.
it DOES sound scammy to me.

it really doesn't matter the person, as long as they aren't so loathed that they have NO followers. it's good news for sure. it's also good news that conservatives who historically would be against news technology like this over irrational fears (it can be used for terrorism, to sell drugs, to sell drugs/sex to our children, whatever) to actually be won over by the technology.
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:05:36
1. the bitcoin has crashed relative to where it was at the height. i don't know micon's finances personally but if i had to guess that alone depleted some of his funds as i'm sure he held a decent amount of coin rather than having it all in fiat.
2. the NVGC raided his house and took everything computer related. there was NOTHING left. you can bet your ass he had some bitcoin on those computers. fortunately not all of them were un-recoverable, but he did tell me they got some of his coins as a result.
3. he's probably spent a helluva lot of money in relocating to antigua, not to mention that island life is significantly more expensive than living in the states.

decriminalizing 1 drug is far from ending the drug war. reducing sentencing is only part of the process. ending the drug war is NOT what rand paul will do.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:22:56
donate to gary johnson instead.
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:06:44
vote for gary johnson
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:55:17
you might want to fact check rand paul and the war on drugs. he is NOT in favor of legalizing drugs of all sorts. he is for decriminalizing marijuana, but that doesn't go nearly far enough.

the terrorists shit is the biggest cop out ever. it's never even been suggested that terrorists launder money w/ online poker outside of these idiots.
it's 100x easier to launder money in LIVE poker games. it's even easier to gamble underage in a live setting than it is online (although cashing out can be a different story).

has ANY evidence been presented to the public to suggest that this "murder for hire" bullshit is anything other than bullshit?

that's what you call it when the loving &amp; caring gov't does it. when you or i do it, we go away for like 30 years to a federal pound me in the ass prison.
@_date: 2015-03-30 21:29:57
and you've seen this? or is it just something the gov't has claimed exists?

"the will of the public."
did i get the chance to voice my opinion on my view of this type of law enforcement tactic? nope. i was allowed to vote for someone who supposedly has my interests in mind, but that also includes the interests of millions of others in the las vegas valley who are voting for the same senator/representatives i have the opportunity to vote for.
if you really think our gov't is representative of the will of the people, i'm through arguing with you, because that's so far from the truth and i don't have the fucking time to sit here and debate someone so naive.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:42:36
so it can fall on deaf ears? no, i have not.
