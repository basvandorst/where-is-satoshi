Does anyone know what BCH does that DASH doesn't already do? I mean, other than the Bitcoin brand...

No, it's not. The central banks are our enemies. We don't want them involved in Bitcoin.

You're asking questions to an account called "throwthisaway12346" on a post which clearly states "this account is obviously a throwaway"?

Jesus christ, what an embarrassing mistake. I'm starting to slack...

Eloquently said, and with no logical fallacies either.

He mentions it in some of his posts on the Bitcoin Talk forum.

Is there any proof of that?

The benefits of credit cards were clear and obvious. 
The benefits of Bitcoin to the average person are meaningless.

This is the attitude that's holding Bitcoin back. A bunch of programmers, libertarians, and finance nerds try to explain to the average person why Bitcoin is awesome and fail to realize that nobody cares about decentralized peer to peer protocols. 
Instead of "wel your just dum then" why not try explaining Bitcoin in a way that appeals to the average person?

That matters only to those deep in the Bitcoin space. To the average person, it's meaningless

Nah, sell them to me. It's going to hit $50 per BTC soon, so I'll buy them from you at that price. You'll be ahead of the market!

Governments will never fucking adopt Bitcoin. It's never going to happen, and if it did it would be the stupidest decision they could possibly make. 
The Winklevoss guys are clueless.

Aww, that's cute
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:43:55
I think I'm going to do that regardless of the government

10 years would be a great start
