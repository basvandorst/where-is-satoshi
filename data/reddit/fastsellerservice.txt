The same as to fiat stuck in banks and ATMs
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:14:29
Your problem is probably with banks, not with exchanges, some banks block transactions with exchanges - like Wells Fargo, for example.
So, even if you find non-KYC exchange, your bank will probably block it.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:43:00
Many stoopid/ignorant people afraid to make a mistake when sending. Even some hodlers never sent anything, they only know to click on buttons - to copy/paste address is like advanced math to them. Other reason could be he's a diehard Trump supporter.

It's all about the power. They don't rule Bitcoin = they don't like it. If they had majority of available Bitcoin, you would see a different story. People in charge absolutely don't like new movements and order changing, why would they? They are so comfortable while poor people are working their asses off for them every day.
Very simple stuff, just think about the big picture.

This is not about Trump actually, neither would Democrat's president be nice to Bitcoin.
It's about changing power and economy order - ruling elite don't want to let that happen and Bitcoin is the greatest threat. Rich and powerful wanna stay rich and powerful and rule the world.

I don't see how Bitcoin will get to 100k by the end of this year. There should be some major event - like some massive war, economy collapse or something  similar to push it there.
Realistic objective is 10-15k.

Bitcoin is not for under 18 persons, neither Reddit is (except teenagers sub).
There were many problems caused by underaged kids trying to scam people online (cause there's no real punishment or just a slap on the wrist)  - now many people dont trust noone when exchanging crypto or trading for digital items.
If I was in charge of Reddit, I would ban you all or limit you to under 18 subs.
There's a reason people must be over 18 to drink, drive or trade fiat/crypto.

Never had any problems with coinpayments, but I usually convert BTC to ETH before sending (buying with ethereum), cause transaction is faster that way.
Anyway, if transaction is timed out, cause timer was gone, coinpayments wallet has your BTC.
Just check that BTC address you sent your coins to.

Never accept Paypal - Paypal is the opposite of Bitcoin - your account can get frozen or suspended anytime, money in Paypal account isn't really yours until you cash it out - can be confiscated by Paypal or chargebacked anytime, you need to give your SSN/personal info to Paypal so you can withdraw - TLDR : Bitcoin good, Paypal bad

Lol, you must be joking. Paypal is notorious for siding with the buyer 99% of times, even if he blatantly lies that"item never arrived" and "is not what was described". People steal millions via Paypal, it's like scammer's best friend. Guess you never sold anything in your life via Paypal.

Bitcoin is not for them.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:17:44
Bitcoin is not unstable. Its value compared to fiat changes, as the value of gold changes too. Anyway you can exchange btc anytime for stable coins and then after time you can exchange it back to Bitcoin. That's why stable coins are invented for.

Paypal is a scam. You don't own anything in there until you cash out. And even when you cash out, if some chargebacks you, they can send collection unit to hunt you. Even 6 months after you sold something.
I don't understand people still using this nightmarish service. Must be brain dead or something.

lmao, good luck with that

Certainly not, but it will make a great competition - which will benefit everybody. Of course they are afraid, they had 100% of market before crypto came out.

It's not based, fiat is there just for comparation, cause fiat is a regulated mean of payment.
It could also be compared to gold's worth, but there's not many people owning 1 kilo of gold so it's definitely easier to compare its worth with established currencies.

You should talk more to people, they are really amazingly stupid and brainwashed (majority).
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:55:31
Why would you jump now with 1 Bitcoin order, if you don't know anything about crypto? A lot of people did that when bitcoin was at $15k.
As for Coinmama, never used them, they are not so popular, they probably pay those websites to promote them.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:14:10
lol, nicely said
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:36:47
Bro, just google "Japan Bitcoin", in Japan, for example, you can buy almost anything with Bitcoin. About, that "getting rich" part - that was the part of the story of America/California colonization - yep, a lot of gold miners died broke and bitter, but look at it now.
Greed can be fuel to create good things too.

Ask them would the US government by now outlaw that alleged "pyramid scheme". And remind them when Bitcoin was born/emerged.
Also ask them if all people would want to take money out of banks, what would happen.
If your parents still think that Bitcoin is ponzi or something similar, they are stupid, I'm sorry.

Or Facebook could just adopt Bitcoin or, cause of current high fees, Ethereum. See, there's no need for FakeCoin. There's no need for Facebook at all, which btw should be burried deep under ground after that personal data theft.

Well, sorry, but that " Jack's been sick on leave" story just smells like big giant hoax. Also, never heard of bitcoin being refunded automatically - cause you gotta pay the separate fee when sending it back. Bitcoin is not Paypal.
I think you've been scammed and you should procede with that cybercrime agency - don't sign any invoices from these scammers if you don't have the product or coins back.

Bro, what Coinbase got to do with a transaction if you sent btc from your local wallet ? I don't get that.
Second, you can trace any transaction simply by copy/paste address that you send btc to [here]( (search field, then just press search)
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:55:16
Honestly, 80% of people are in just for the gains. They treat BTC as stocks.
