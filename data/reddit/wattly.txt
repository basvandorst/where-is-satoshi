I agree, its just this Head and Shoulder trend has become more and more of a concern recently. Just wanted to share my thoughts that we're proving it wrong like you said.

So there are absolutely no upcoming forks? Also does GDAX or Gemini support the B2X or BCP rumored splits?
Thanks in advance!

You know this is a really good point. We pulled up a bit today but I think it'll be picking up around then like you're saying. We'll see what 2018 has in store!
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:07:52
Yeah, I'll watch for a pullback for sure. Maybe 50-60% and then we'll see!

Seems like my bigger issue is getting my news for Crypto in general, do you great folks have any personal recommendations on where to go to get the latest accurate news?
Thanks for all the support from the community!

I think the greatest news will get is increase in transaction times and decreases in transaction fees. Lighting will play a big part in that hopefully

I'm doing the best I can, being it my first major investment my imagination tends to drift haha

Because the technology is only getting better and more popular. With a limited supply and increasing demand, the price is going to have to go back up. I personally send money internationally and would hope I would be able to set up an account on the other end and simply send over a crypto that they could then withdraw on their end just as easily. I think 2018 will be an important year to indicate where Crypto will go. With all eyes on us this year it will be important to see steady progress in the technology to gain mainstream confidence.

Yeah at this point I think weve powered through it
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:32:21
I think we're still okay with using it as a storage of value instead of a currency. Don't know how long that'll last but you do have a point...

The Bentley isn't gonna buy itself lol. But in all seriousness, I have great hopes for the upcoming year. Looks like we're on a good start
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:29:38
Looks a little too late for that

This wasn't about the price, it was about the strong support that was shown in expectations of a fall. The price the support is at is irrelevant, the strength of the support is what I'm happy to see.

Not at all, just glad that all this uncertainty was proven wrong.

Want to recommend some people/pages to follow? Seems like Twitter keeps coming up for the real time news like you are saying

I agree Crypto has shown that it can simply not be predicted like other financial markets.
