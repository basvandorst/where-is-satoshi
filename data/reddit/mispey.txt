Or these guys dumped the database to a CSV which is pretty common. The export method of a database implies nothing about how it was stored so making any conclusion is wrong.

I've banned Bitcoin from two subreddits I moderate too (one large subreddit). Just the whole fucking word, Dogecoin and other cryptos. 
There's so many stupid Bitcoin spambots, people spamming unrelated Bitcoin related comments and Bitcoin articles that have nothing to do with anything. It's really the only way to get rid of the goddamn bots that keep posting in our communities. That and I keep submitting them to At this point it's just easier to ban the whole term and when someone submits something actually relevant they can message us to have it approved.

I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't visit very much and I can't imagine side chains being very large technology news in the grand scheme of things.

Oh god, this is a ridiculous argument back.
If they managed to make the whole site run off a series of CSV files I would be impressed. People would be lining up to ask them how they managed to do it. It would be idiotic, but it would demonstrate that they are FUCKING AWESOME at running a website (in the most uselessly challenging way possible).
I don't think you understand. They would have to be GOOD AT what they do to run a site off CSV files. They would be doing it in an overly complex way, but we could assume they're good at what they do.

Are you replying to the wrong person? I have nothing to do with I don't know why I would be looking for that post. 
It's a big deal in THIS community. It's not a big deal to the general population. Most people don't hold Bitcoin so it doesn't affect them. Oculus is something attainable by the general population though and something that most gamers would probably care about at least a little.

I'll comment on this with the same as what I said above.
I have banned a lot of crypto related words from the two subs I moderate, one of them large. Because it's the only way to get rid of all of the goddamn bots and people who constantly link to completely unrelated bitcoin/dogecoin/crypto bullshit. It is just a boatload of spam trying to hype it up. You would not friggan believe the shit people try to post or comment with. And then these people are often such jackasses when you try to have a discussion with them about cryptos. 
It's a huge hassle, our community votes it down every time and then during a community discussion in the larger subreddit it was near unanimously requested to be removed from the community. 
We would have to bring on an additional moderator if we wanted to manually filter through the amount of crypto crap that gets spammed.

Bluntly, no you're still absolutely wrong. Most stupidity is doing the wrong thing because it is the easy way or just not doing it at all. A CSV database would actually demonstrate some level of misguided skill. I'd be sitting here impressed if they ran that whole site off CSV files.

It's actually kind of the new...thing now. The problem is that  .com is basically the only TLD that matters and most good domains are gone or squatted on. 
Time to move away from  .com being the only relevant TLD and they're doing that by adding many many more and trying to reduce the relevance of  .com

It kinda parallels why a lot of website admins used to (and still do?) have the .ru and a few other countries domain banned by default when people register using an email address. It's just a waste of effort to look at those accounts and ban them manually - they're always spam.
I used to have Bitcoin/Dogecoin/etc be removed as spam and then a message sent to the mod team for us to review the acceptability of it's removal after reviewing the comment and the account posting it. Not once have we approved a comment so to keep our modmail activity down we've now removed that notification. It was that bad. 
It's bad for this community, but we put our communities first.

No one "deserves" to suffer the consequences of being an average person.

I agree with you, there is no way they are LPP. The purpose of that category is for things that "collectable" but hold a specific value as well, to put it into simple laymans terms. 
BitCoin does not meet this purpose at all, and would be classified otherwise.
