Hahaha. I'm laughing because I'm confused as to how that's even funny and even more confused as I try to find out what Jon thought he meant which is making me laugh harder. (Essentially he succeeded.)
Nice pickup though. Have a berry @_date: 2015-05-06 08:47:31

Because the USD is the reserve currency of the world the inflation effects are sent overseas. But this will not be sustainable for much longer.

Satoshi has commented on Greece, nice :)

Link? I can't see anything here...

Have 200 bits to help spread the love in Greece :) @_date: 2015-07-02 09:12:20
This is really great.
100 bits @_date: 2015-07-04 03:41:40
Powerful write up. Sorry to hear that you didn't adopt bitcoin sooner. Have 250 bits on me It's insane that a fortnight ago it would have been crazy for Greeks to take their money out of the bank but now that is what everyone desperately wants to do.
The worst part is that the rest of the word is not paying nearly enough attention to the lesson in this. You cannot trust your banks, things change very quickly.

If everyone used bitcoin this wouldn't even be an issue.
No one could take this guy's money.

The global financial system is built up on the premise of countries being in debt. To participate, you must borrow. It is working for now, but cracks are beginning to appear and before long, the system will collapse. Debt is an addiction, it's nice in the short term, but it also skewers your perspective because you're addicted to it. In good time, the poison that is debt will begin eating away at our societies.

Yeah. We're doing it lower case on our business cards and our logo is a lower case "fk" in a box (you can see it on Twitter  Essentially when we refer to it in a title by itself we have it lower case, do you think we should make it upper case?

I know how to code and I know my limitations. I wouldn't pretend to know about something I don't. If a client wanted to do something that I thought presented security risks I wouldn't be able to adequately address I'd try to hook them up with someone who can. And I do know some security experts who work with Bitcoin I could point them to.

Thanks for your advice, very helpful :) have a berry @_date: 2015-04-16 10:16:59
I don't see anyone else setting up a digital currency consultancy. If business is going to adopt digital currency it needs to know how and having people who can walk them through it face to face is going to be really valuable for those who need that extra help. (As opposed to just researching it themselves and learning from scratch.)

Australia. I'm covering Victoria and I've trained another person up for New South Wales.

Good question, but no. I wish I could say yes :)
I came across Bitcoin in 2012. I couldn't buy any. I still can't, it's really hard to buy when you're under 18. You have to get an adult to set up an exchange account for you. Or you have to buy it at inflated prices in real life or at a bitcoin ATM.
Luckily I know some people who help me buy it.

I'm still in school, this is just a personal project that I work on in my own time. I meet up with people running small businesses in my area and help them accept bitcoin as a payment method.
I hope to do consulting with larger organisation next year (once I've finished school.)
@_date: 2015-04-16 10:14:05
Yeah. It's pretty rough at the moment. I'll definitely refine the copy.
Essentially we help small businesses set up Bitcoin as a payment option. We walk them through how it works and why it's worth it.
We will also provide more general Bitcoin advice for larger businesses, I've already spoken to people from banks, traditional payment companies and even a super market who are all interested in me doing some research on how digital currency and Bitcoin in particular will effect them.

I am in school. Except I get one day off a week to work and I work at a Bitcoin startup. I do front end design and development there. This is my own personal project as I believe that a consulting firm is missing from this space.

The site is pretty rough right now, though I have tested it across a few browsers on PC, Mac, iOS and Android. Could you tell me what device and browser you're using? I'll look over my code and try to fix the problems. Thanks for pointing them out :)

Thanks for your help everyone. He's interested in giving it a shot and he will, it's definitely cheaper that say, Western Union. But it also looks like P2P platforms such as Transfer Wise are even better still.
Thanks again!

Come on man! Haven't you heard the news? Ƀ is for bitcoin!
Some of the ID templates need to incorporate the new Ƀ, there are resources to do this in the link above too.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:08:09
Feed me. I am a so hungry for more bitcoins so I can get full of them. Everywhere I look I want to see the bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:20:34
Genius. To continue your research into how we can utilise computers to mine bitcoins, please have a berry Ending human based mining could make bitcoin mainstream.

Add a way to pay a carbon offset.
This could be built into wallets as an add on option, bitcoin fees are so low anyway, throwing a few cents into a forest fund wouldn't hurt.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:40:45
Needs the Ƀ
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:27:11
Thanks for your detailed and extensive answer explaining how things look from a dev viewpoint.
You've inspired me to offer my design services to the open source community. Great work, have a berry /u/changetip
