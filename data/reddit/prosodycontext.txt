( &lt;3 ) Collectively or normally I am too numb to feel positive about a compliment which is easy ping to give, but I feel your pain and feel a bit happier as well that it works sometimes what we feel, how *money comes and goes* is equal to *emotion comes and goes.* It was learning from kindnessyess of strangers that led me to prototype repeatable wayz to share better withunder so much bitter (and maybe add a tiny bit of glitter :). Kids might even be able to count that gesture fully.
I've lost a lot of real life data. It might make me cry to remember really, I do not usually want to remember, vut I've turned it to a hobby scouring old hard drives as "information is perishable" rings truer to social-emotional-memory issues than anything facing reality.

It's weird cause imf not comfortable feeling like Oprah which is what sharing portrays if it is a rare speculative commodity, it is only weird feeling definitely because it is rare to share feelings through so much conflict we barely can bear to hear. I think if collective consciousness was normalized, asking  and  would be imfpowerful statemwents. 
We are trapped by recreating ideas that we are boxed to only ethereal emotions (and thus hidden and unacceptable emotional accountabiltiies and responsibilities at scale and scope). What is stranger than empathy is apathabitical. ( [

Whether talking iAmA's or trauma survivors, reddit is full of personal sensitive information, the question is how some sorts of identity are allowed while others are repressed, based on how you talk about it.
There are numerous examples of real named personal identity liabilities being part of work and play here, and I realize empathy for how sensitive it is to filter, but I am tired of being forced to judgementally hurt myself for what others do too just because I use a different word or link (serialities).

Deep granulararities. Systemic covering versus transparency accounting. 4 empathy
Important outlines for trauma, terrorgation, corruption are found from unsayable, negated efforts to describe and (psycho)log activity of social agencies meant to tax and patrol empathogen-entactogenesis realities.pain
For psychological governance to recognize patterns we bite at, would change our social structure to engaging empathic accuracy as a valid identification of law (versus innate, systemic, unbalanced, unchecked fear made apathic mecha ve. meda war).
Branching centreal from historical alphabet agencies fighting to check and balance eachother with hidden language and proped public relations, agreedily and speciously sorrounding a pie chart of parts of speech barely determinate enough (definitely lacks empathic determination) to find human beings open deeper, to realize empathy for the granular fact that without cert cent rooted transparency, capital corporal force become repeating trauma scales.

The joke is serious because admins race through who gets their paid self-identity addressed, while remaining present and aggressive at accounting to ignore any need for users to list free bit-identity addresses.

Generate an address and share, was why I felt determined microempathy from microcurrency was realistic ( /  Because of feeling that your own number was enough to share important identification:






Cryptocurrency was coded for many legal-rational factors, but being restricted from sharing basic numbers for basic needs is repressive.
