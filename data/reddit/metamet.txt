Might trade at $6000+, you mean.
Nothing is guaranteed. Don't fool yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:46:51
The problem is that the solution to this isn't guaranteed to ever occur.

Just look at the volatility across the board. You need stability to have actual value store.

If you actually followed a worn out meme as an investment strategy, I am sorry to hear that.
It's been obvious there's no use case for Bitcoin for... A long time. It's been trusted as a backbone crypto based solely off of scarcity.
With all the FUD and the tether news, things continue to head in the direction of uncertainty.
If you think you should weather the storm and continue to eat losses until it may or may not turn around, if the dust ever settles, then do so.
But if you don't know *why* you should, don't trust in memers yelping "hodl".
It's literally all a gamble right now and has been for a while. You gotta decide if you want to keep all your chips on black.

Wtf would anyone recommend Fidelity over Vanguard?
Vanguard Index funds are the best performing, lowest fee, safest bet out there.

Storage is cheap, so it wouldn't hurt to back up to multiple. SSD over spinning media as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:44:09
SSDs are much more reliable than spinning media. The only instance where this wouldn't be the case is if you're constantly rewriting the cells... All day, every day, for 5+ years. 
There's almost no reason to use spinning here, assuming the HD they're backing up is 512GB or less. The additional liability of your backup failing due to the hardware isn't worth it.

Coinbase has been a horrowshow. I was set up on Gemini in around 30 hours, start to finish. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:59:15
Deeply consider buying another hd and backing up an image of the hd in case you break it or something happens.

BTC isn't a valid currency right now due to the fluctuations in price. By the time a transaction has cleared on the chain, your $10 purchase could be worth $8 or $13. 
And with currency inflation, it's actually safer to convert your country's worthless money into a more stable fiat.
Even when BTC was $100, there was always uncertainty in spending due to the fluctuations. 
With that, if I didn't spend the BTC I had in 2013, I wouldn't have "lost" hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Something needs to happen before there's any form of confidence in spending BTC as a currency anytime soon, especially with the insane trajectories we've seen recently. If you believe it's going up, you're not going to buy a potentially $10,000 pizza. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:49:50
There's always Gemini for ETH. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:11:11
The primary issue is there volatility. Maybe that will some day steady out and inflate expectedly. Until then, it won't be usable as a real currency.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:26:06
Yeah--solid state hard drive over a traditional platter one. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:42:24
Oprah?! :D
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:26:01
What was your grade?
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:24:35
But no one would want to tell their friends! ;)
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:02:35
Thank you! Got my wallet address and everything now. On to some mining I suppose?
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:02:31
So how does one best get started with all this doge? 
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:00:46
Floss and smell it next time.
Then imagine that being in your mouth, on your breath, all day.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:11:43
Bitcoin is no longer the only blockchain technology out there, nor is it the most efficient or even useful.
The transaction fees are too high for it to be a real currency, and it doesn't have anything as useful as even a smart contract.
Bitcoin is the first and was a great proof of concept. It's lack of further innovation didn't mean crypto has failed, though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:39
You *do* realize that the value of BTC is 100% based on perceived value, right? It's basically correlated with worldwide FUD temperature. 
It's imaginary value. If not enough people believe in it, it ceases to be worth anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:38:01


Tether may be bigger than MtGox. 


There's a lot of reason. Tons of international FUD and Tether. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:09
Okay. 
So you're not troubled that the $1000 you were hiding a month ago is now only worth $600?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:25:55
But both of those are moot when half the value you're securing or hiding disappears in the course of a couple months due to volatility.
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:33:14
For what?
Last time I bought something it was 2013. Now it costs too much per transaction, is too volatile, and there are much better options available.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:45:21


Nobody's forcing anyone to do anything. 
You're in a thread. This is where opinions are shared. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:48:00
It's market manipulation coming off of some pretty hefty international FUD. Can't know what else is coming in the future, but it certainly brought a ton of attention to the sandy state of value that BTC is resting on presently. 
I didn't mind Korea and India so much, as those things ebb and flow, but I don't see a rebound for BTC around the corner with the whole Tether situation. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:39:53
That's only true if it's done crashing and going to recover. 
Don't you wonder why ETH is maintaining and BTC is dropping? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:07:48
It's not just users of that exchange. It's the artificial inflation of the value of BTC as an entity. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:01:16
 may be worth a read. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:54:22
How is the market misbehaving?
What does BTC offer that ETH doesn't? 
It seems to me that the market might finally be maturing. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:09:06
But the value of BTC is shared across exchanges. The tether situation means that there's fake fiat artificially pumping the value of BTC. This affects all BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:37:16
It's how memers spell hold.
So if you see someone using it unironically... Well, just think about what they're saying a bit differently.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:37:08


And guess how much worse than MtGox Tether could be. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:34:58
I mean, why would you hold until you lost all your money? It's clearly going down. Not like it's going to spike tomorrow. Too much FUD and Tether is sorta the bowtie. 
Signals have been very strong. Don't ignore a very real market out of principle. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:41:09
I guess it depends on if you want to make money or gamble. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:11:22


Isn't that almost a Ponzi scheme? You can keep it going so long as you keep getting more people to give you money. 
Then *poof*. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:30:46
Keep doing it, move elsewhere?
@_date: 2013-10-03 12:38:55
But why publicize the seize?
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:04:42
So did he lose his job over the meme?
