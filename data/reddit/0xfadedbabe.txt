I wouldn't mind the 0.001 fee on it's own, but combined with the withdrawal limits it feels really shitty.  Instead of being able to withdraw what you want in one transaction and pay the fee once you are forced to withdraw small amounts per day and pay the fee many times. :(

Not to be rude, but why am I supposed to care that some fellow sold his Bitcoin like two weeks ago?

If censorship in is cancer then is more akin to a pack of cigarettes than a cure.

That transaction means the chart [looks like this]( until you move it over, it's really quite annoying.

For the love of god stop upvoting these gifs, especially when the price has only moved $100 or so.

Correct.  The whole point of Bitcoin is to have personal responsibility for your own funds.

When do we get to the point where we can just ignore everything Roger Ver says?  Colour me surprised if he actually follows through on this bribery, personally I think it's just more attention seeking bullshit.

Refuse to watch computerphile since their stupid as fuck 'there's no-one to call on the phone when something goes wrong' video.  Can't take a channel that's supposed to be about computing seriously when it's an old man behind the times trying to appear like an expert on a subject they know fuck all about.  I'm gonna assume this is much the same.

Scan are pretty good, they built my current computer, accepted my btc without any problem.  Guess I won't even bother checking Overclockers for stuff anymore.

I don't trust this at all, there isn't even a page explaining exactly what it is you do and/or how you do it.

You're welcome, I will admit I like the idea of the service, just it would have to be super trustworthy before I'd go anywhere near it.  How you can achieve that I couldn't tell you I'm afraid, but more info on your site would definitely be a start.

Good luck with that.

Click bait shitposting from ProHashing, color me surprised, not.

You won't get your BCC from it because BCC will be on a separate chain, you will however be able to export your private keys and use them in a wallet that supports BCC.  You're not just going to magically get BCC, BCC is going to be a fork of Bitcoin which means your private key on BCC's blockchain will have the same number of coins your private key on Bitcoin's blockchain has at the moment of the fork.

You guys should really start responding to shit on your own subreddit when people post on it.  It's all the more infuriating when so many of you pop out of the woodwork to respond to posts on other subreddits.  How hard is it to look at your own sub once a day?
