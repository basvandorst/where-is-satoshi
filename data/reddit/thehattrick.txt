Other claim : that it is legal and shouldn't be spoken out against even if it held up adoption.

Funny thing about Indonesia. . . it's actually terrifyingly diverse.
When I was there in 2009, they had just supposedly passed a country-wide law against exposed shoulders on females, yet less than a third of the population complied.
No joke, when I got to the airport in Jakarta, the music video playing on every TV in the airport (via MTV Asia, I think) involved a very pretty and scantily clad Malaysian pop-star in full leather fetish outfit kidnapping a man and keeping him in a cage during her music video.
So yeah, I'm going to need you to take your bullshit and your ignorance and your cowardice and turn them all sideways, and then cram them up your ass.

For clarity: I'm not the original poster you responded to. I just wanted to provide that perspective.
If your assertion is that it doesn't retard long-term adoption rates when people hoard coins--well, you're welcome to think that. I've got no study data one way or another.
I thought you were making the other claim.  Your clarification means we disagree, but I have no interest in debating you on the topic.

Just because it's not wrong doesn't mean it isn't one of the largest problems hampering long-term bitcoin adoption.

Geocities and MySpace are apples to oranges. The point stands and your ad hominem attempt to dig at the previous poster's age is embarrassing to read.
