If you fear inflation, why not choose precious metals?
Ironically enough, Bitcoin is the worst method of preserving your wealth. The volatility is absolutely insane, and the whole project is really hanging in the balance - confidence in Bitcoin could collapse at any moment, just as it did in 2011 when MtGox got hacked which it barely managed to survive.
You might have a chance of getting rich if you hold Bitcoin, but to say your wealth is safe in it is absurd. It's equivalent to gambling your wealth.

A debit card?
Google recently came out with Google Wallet which lets you send cash via a simple email message with no fees

I won't be addressing your response then as it is not relevant to my post, having merely read the title of my post without informing yourself of the content.

Why is it that Bitcoiners turn out usually to be problem gamblers? Probably no coincidence.
Thankfully I've never lost much through gambling.
On the occasion I feel the impulse to gamble or to play around for the unattainable winning strategy, I just bet micro amounts. Surprisingly, you still get the strong feelings of both winning and losing, but at the end of the stint I end up only losing 0.01BTC or ~$5.
It's a sad and unfortunate fact that Bitcoin has enabled so many problem gamblers to whittle away their wealth so easily.
