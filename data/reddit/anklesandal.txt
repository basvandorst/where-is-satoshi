“ will end up with a nice job and a nice salary and the skills to be potentially rich. It's not the lambo's I care about, but about having a nice house for my mother and a nice car and life for myself.”
Instead of great life we have good life, my definition of good is better than most peoples current lives imho

Intentions and hard work mean nothing in capitalism religion of america where money is god, we dont live in a meritocracy so the world is completely fucked and miserable, the most ruthless rise to the top
I gave all my friends money when it really helped them, a handout to me is a drop in the bucket for others but would create an entirely different personal world for me but nobody cares

Nice trolling, fyi, i sold all of my 50 btcs in 2016 for pot and pot induced expensive munchies and am now a year sober and have completely turned my life around, my life is pretty great in every way except no btc or cryptos, limited savings but im working on that, kill me now

Your comment may have helped me the most, with a great username like yours i feel especially validated or unsurprised haha
I spent 50 btc on pot last year and only have a fraction of 1 today, my issue is i really did believe in btc but pot changes anyones mind state and values and ive since turned my life around since quitting (11 months sober now)
What you said, i dont deserve that money bc of my lack of impulse control
That resonates deeply w me n means a lot to me bc i felt like i did deserve it bc id never do anything unwise financially unless pot is in the picture (100 pieces of evidence eg i had 100$ to my name 1 year ago and now ive almost got a btc in savings)
But the sober me chose the get high (impulse control etc) so i really dont deserve that money

you seem brilliant!   and at least somewhat kind, any chance you would give me some advice?  I sold every single one of my 50 bitcoins last year for pot(weed head wasnt getting goals accomplished for 15 years besides a regular state college masters degree in finance of all things), i am since a year sober and have completely turned my life around but i could sure use that million (have 5k to name but bought BI4L necessities this year), please advise, or tip me to get a btc tatoo? lol (as i love the political/revolutionary aspect of it and would never sell sober)

I feel my story is different/worse bc i sold in 2016 (so recently) and that i always believed in btc and love it, i bought my first coin in 2014 and sold over 40 in 2016, i only sold to feed the final year of a 15 year daily/nightly pot addiction, Which was spending 800$ per month more on food than i spend sober as well as 400$ a month on pot so 1200 * 12 but it was that i only worked 25 hours a week, average, all year whereas i work 50 to 70 hours a week now
Ive since tuned my life around the past 11 months (zero financial problems etc, better health/career/hobbies/relationships etc) and committed to quitting for only a year bc i had 100$ to my name last December etc, now ive got closer to 10k but since the btc boom I committed to 15 years w no pot in my life bc its clearly life ruining, so i have the most devastating tragic mentally disturbing btc story ever bc id never spend my savings sober, only add to it, pot changes your mind state and therefore values (tree hugging pot is everything mentality) (i have no vices wo pot). Can you please advise me? Sometimes i feel like life is more work than its worth but the main reason suicide is not an option is that im continually better than i was yesterday and while i only have 8 months of living expenses in savings now thats the most ive had in 5 years and i can have 36 months of living expenses in savings if i work 70 hour weeks all of 2018 which is super tough, hence the ‘life is more work than its worth’ idea except what happens in dec 2018?  Awesomeness and a ‘good’ life where i can then continue to earn&gt;spend by working probably 50 hours
This type mini celebration (proof that pot is heroin to me (literally was homeless/sleeping in car/car camping in walmart/neighborhoods) for a few weeks after I graduated w my masters degree bc i smoked too much my final year of grad school
This celebration also occurred this month as i can have 10 months of living expenses by the end of dec if i work hard
