Mathematical ability wouldn't have led many to expect the increase in value bitcoin has seen.

You've taken your initial investment out though, right?

Good investors buy low and sell high. 
The gamble here is knowing if this is the low and is btc will recover. 
I believe that the low will be reached over the coming days, can't pretend to know if btc can recover but I am tempted to invest again possibly next week.

I mean fair enough if you truly believe that, but with such margins taking out your investment (when it's less than 10% of your assets) would turn this into a no lose situation with almost the same massive pay offs.

 It's like attacking a brick wall that crumbles under a Chinese fist, unfortunately

Bitcoin is no where near ready for that yet. 
I think the concept is in the right direction though. Crypto is likely the long term future, but it'll likely be a different crypto and a decade or more away.
