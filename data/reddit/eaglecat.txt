Intrinsic V Extrinsic does not pick out "Subjective" V "Objective".
Nor does it pick out "Use Value" V "Exchange Value" as suggests.
Something has intrinsic value if it is valued as a end in itself. Something has extrinsic value if it is valued as a means to something else (with intrinsic value).
Each of these kinds of valuing are subjective in that all value judgements are psychological states. It doesn't follow that because someone has the psychological state of valuing something they can't therefore value it as an end in itself. That is, that value is subjective does not entail there is no such thing as intrinsic valuing.
Often enough something might be valued intrinsically and extrinsically. Surfing at the beach might be valued for the pleasure of surfing itself, and as a means to increase one's fitness. A car might be valued as a beautiful work of engineering and as means of taking you to the beach.
At other times something might be valued purely intrinsically and another thing valued purely extrinsically (or as close to pure as one can get). 
A painting you've made might have enormous value to you, intrinsic value, due to its having secured the right abstract art colour objectives you sought, while having no resale value at all (because no one else is interested in buying it). Such a painting is valued purely intrinsically. 
An aged hammer, on the other hand, you might keep solely in order to bang in the occasional nail, while being a hammer without any resale value (because there is a hardware store where you live that has superior, new hammers going dirt cheap). Such a hammer is valued purely extrinsically.
The intrinsically valued painting has no "use value" (in that you don't use it for some purpose beyond it's own enjoyment) while the extrinsically valued hammer has only "use value". Neither have "exchange value".
Currency often has purely extrinsic value. That is, being valued purely as a means to something else. The qualification is that sometimes it is also intrinsically valued:
* When a collector buys a newly minted coin to hang on the mantle piece,
* When people lose their way and become mostly motivated for the accumulation of more currency, having forgotten that it ought be used as a means to some other end.
* When someone, perhaps like most of us here, gets into bitcoin due to a fascination with the technology itself.
But ordinarily currency is valued purely as a means to something else. That is, ordinarily currency is valued purely extrinsically.


If we have in mind distinctions intrinsic V extrinsic and use value V exchange value, then the above claims of the professor are wrong.
If bitcoin is to acquire mainstream success then it must be because it is valued extrinsically in virtue of its exchange value. 
That is, "if people exchange it, it will have value. That's what makes me think it does have extrinsic value" would have been the right thing to say.
However, I think the professor does not have these distinctions in mind in the context of the interview and is, as happens in off-the-cuff interviews, speaking loosely. Here her "use it" seems to mean "use it" to exchange it for goods and services, here her "intrinsic" seems to mean "metaphorically inheres in the currency". In this way she is not wrong and it would be uncharitable to think that in another context, in a context of writing a paper say, she would express herself in the way that she did.


Often enough when "X is subjective" is claimed it marks a conflation between the holding of a psychological state and whether the holding of the psychological state can be (properly) justified on mind dependent grounds.
Jim believes that the sun will rise in the east rather than the west. Jim's belief is subjective in that its a psychological state belonging to Jim. It doesn't follow that his belief is justified on subjective grounds. That is, most of us will hold it that Jim's belief must be (properly) justified objectively. That is, on belief independent grounds. He must justify his belief on observations about the sun. If he holds his belief merely because others belief the sun rises in east, that is on subjective grounds, we will say Jim's belief is not (properly) justified.
Those that claim "X is subjective" usually rely, perhaps unintentionally, on the trivial truth that X is held as some psychological state to ground their implied assertion that X is not justified objectively (in the mind independent sense).
"All value is subjective" is not only sloppy in this way, it ignores the controversy around whether value judgements are justified on objective (non mental) grounds.
Philosophers, those that spend time debating this question, are somewhat evenly split, with the larger portion thinking that some valuing is objective (in being justified on non mental grounds) ...

As far as I skimmed this analysis I found it meandering and off the mark.
As soon as we get clear on what "intrinsic value" means all this confusion around whether it exists or not can disappear. I don't think North was helpful in this regard. You can reject a Labour theory of value and still hold that goods and activities have intrinsic value. A modified cut and paste from another of my posts ....

The main point is that while Powell is right to write ...


... It does not follow that there is no intrinsic value. 
TL:DR; if people value something it remains to be distinguished whether they value it intrinsically (as an end in itself) or extrinsically (as a means to some end).

This misunderstanding of the meaning of "intrinsic value" is common. I can't quite see why.

Unless you find "Valued as an end in itself" contradictory you misread the sentence. I'm stipulating a definition, [a definition that is not mine alone]( in other words "Intrinsic value" means "valued as an end in itself".
Do you find contradictions  in ... 


Where did I claim value was preexisting?


Right. I had expressly endorsed the first part of Powell's claim


Moreover my concluding sentence was

Good letter. 
If you get another chance in your dialogue with the bank could you also clarify whether non business users who use their NAB bank account to buy bitcoins, and receive AUD for bitcoins sold, will have their accounts closed?

For password management the main contenders seem to be:
* Truecrypt. An encrypted file that you "mount" so that it appears as another drive. Keep your passwords in one or more files within that. Pro: your master password gives you access to a whole file system so you can also use it to store all sorts of documents (bank statements, copy of your driver's licence, etc) at the same place and time as managing your passwords. Formely closed source, currently open source. Con: A labour intensive way to get at your password ... no form fill function. 
* Lastpass. Your password file is encrypted locally before being sent to a cloud service. Pros: the ability to sync and use your password file across multiple computers and platforms; form filling function. Cons: As with any cloud service a potential for the NSA to secretly require backdoors; The encryption software runs as a browser plugin perhaps (??) having a greater potential for browser vulnerabilities to exploit your file.
* Keypass. Desktop software. Pros: Local control over your encrypted file unless your machine is compromised (something entirely possible) there is no external access to your encrypted password file. Open Source. Con: Syncing between computers is more tricky (??), not the same cross platform support as Lastpass. Big Con: the date fields (last accessed, date created, etc) have a bug such that you can't sort those columns. A bug persisting for years but ignored because the lead developer can't reproduce it. One of these days I'll help out by providing more detail in the bug database.
* Bruce Schneier's Password safe. Desktop software. Pros: Open Source.  Bruce Schneier did the initial design and coding. On initial impressions it works much like Keypass. Doesn't have the date sorting problem. Con: As with keypass syncing between computers takes a bit more work than with Lastpass.
Any of these solutions, out of the box and by default, face the same basic vulnerability: If you have a keylogger installed on your machine and a hacker can copy your encrypted file then typing your masterpasscode gives the hacker access to all the things.
To guard against that scenario, as mentioned in the article (and most here will know), you need two factor security. Two factor security is having to take two steps before access is granted. Generally these two steps are divided into something you know (like a passcode) and something you have (a uniquely addressed: mobile phone, thumb drive, or some other physical token).
So if you have the second factor even a hacker in possession of your encrypted file and masterpasscode cannot access your encrypted file of passcodes.
The leading solution here seems to a Yubikey thumb drive. Lastpass, Keypass, and Password Safe all support it.  supports it. But they support it in different ways and that is the current frontier of my research. 
I'm looking at how the one time passcode generated by Yubikey works, how things are handled when no connection to the Net is available, the ability to use the Yubikey with a backed up encrypted passcode file (on which a One time passcode might fail), whether the client software uses Yubikey's one time passcode scheme at all or uses another scheme offered by Yubikey, etc.
I'm also looking at other second factor alternatives, like google authenticator.
I'm currently favoured toward Password safe because: there is no cloud necessity; doesn't have the date bug that Keypass does; and will (like Keypass) provide all sorts of handy password generation and filling features that a truecrypt solution wouldn't.
However, the concern with Password Safe is that [its use of Yubikey as a second factor is not quite as robust as it might first appear](
The other things to think about (frequently debated issues) are:
* What are the rules you'll use for generating your masterpasscode: minimum length; character space; using dictionary words or avoiding them, etc?
* How will you handle masterpasscodes? Memorise, never write down, frequently rehearse; Memorise and write it down on paper; Store the paper in a bank safety deposit box or grandma's herb garden?; etc
* How will you handle private keys (for example in order to make backups of your Yubikey you'll have to store a long private key string somewhere)?  Enter it only after booting from Ubuntu live thumbdrive (thereby avoiding an internet connected machine); how many thumbdrives should the private key to be backed up to; should any of this involve a further secret splitting scheme?
It seems that although many have a clear idea of what bad and worst practice is, a clear definition of best practice for a standard user seems elusive. That seems to apply as much for bitcoin security as for password security.
