Ok, cool.  I figured it was something scammy/spammy like that, but I knew the community would know what it's about.

Why are you asking? I'm just curious, I have a rooted phone and the blockchain app, but I don't store any money on it. 
Is there a known vulnerability here?

Hmm, that's really interesting. Thanks.

Dammit, and I just bought a new router from bitcoinstore.

Good luck!

I doubt he'll make it, but I've lost overly one-sided bets before...

I've used gyft many times, and I've never felt it was shady. Carry on.

I've known some people who were greatly helped out by Sean's Outpost.  Great organization.

This is so cool.  Now I finally have actual skin in the game.  Baby steps!!

I learned this same lesson with bitcoinstore. The send from Coinbase took forever, so the invoice expired.

Seem totally legit. 
The only problem I had was paying from a Coinbase wallet. The payment took way too long to post, so the order didn't complete, but then hours later the coins sent. But the invoice had since expired. 
Currently working with support to just manually put in the order, since there's already clear documentation that I sent the correct amount to the right address. Support is just as nice as can be, I look forward to doing more business with bitcoinstore.

Exactly. The Coinbase minimum of .1 btc per purchase is really the only thing preventing me from slowly investing more. When you're paycheck to paycheck, $30-40 is significant. But if I could throw $5 here or $10 there, it would be great.

I'm in the same boat, zero disposable income. But I've watched a dime my friend gave me balloon up to $.33 so that's pretty cool.

Good looking download, this will help me answer those tricky questions I'm sure I'll be asked at family gatherings this coming week as I try to explain the whole bitcoin thing.  
Also, this might be just me, but I think it'd be easier to tip you if you posted a QR of your address.  You know how lazy people can be with copy-pasting.
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:33:00
Well, that escalated quickly.

It's neat watching you learn and figure this whole thing out, and reminds me I was in the same, confusing and awe-inspiring situation a few months ago.
