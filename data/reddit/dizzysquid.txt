I give it a try. This is what they say: "senpai (senior coworker), do you know virtual currencies? I know, you hear about it a lot recently, don't you? yeah, bitcoin right? I know, it's super fast. yes, you can't see it, but it still exists. exactly! and it comes out like 'poaa' and scares you. what? no, bitcoin isn't scary. eh, it's  not? senpai, do you really understand what I'm talking about? yes, I totally understand!"
I am not sure but I think the blonde is mistaking bitcoin for some kind of ghost. because the first half of the Japanese word for virtual currency (仮装) means also costume....

I don't understand why long term hodlers would not want to have a bear market now. personally I hope we go down below 3K before the next bull cycle to 100K. That way I can accumulate more BTC than if it goes up from where we are now.

The sad truth is that probably at some point banks will allow bitcoin accounts and most people will leave their bitcoins with the bank because they can't handle the responsibility if being their own bank.

It does for sure over the last 30 days: 
Of cause not when you start from the peak, but then again if you look at 2 years ;) Also interesting to see the BTC/RUR volume. It was huge last year and super low all 2014. Looks like they got the timing right (well, not all)
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:02:34
Yeah, I also don't see how this could work now. I suggest you use paypal and bitcoin directly (or via a payment processor and keep the coins) as payment option for your shop. Then people can also use credit cards with paypal. At some point Paypal will probably integrate bitcoin fully, so I guess at that time your scenario will be possible.

@_date: 2014-12-18 15:01:04
You are right about Overstock and all the other companies who recently accepted Bitcoin. I mean it's great that merchant adoption is growing so much, but the problem is that for the consumer there is really no big advantage right now to choose Bitcoin over there existing payment method. What needs to happen is that the merchants pass the cost saving advantage from accepting Bitcoin to the consumer by offering a discount. Then there would be an incentive to use Bitcoin.
I think what we need and what we will see in 2015 are more applications where bitcoin has a unique advantage over other payment methods. Something that really offers something new for the average user. Like openbazaar or gambit. That will really drive adoption.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:32:54
Try these to get an idea how to put your bitcoins to use. And I am sure there are many more interesting apps coming out in 2015 which are not possible with traditional payment systems.
1) Donate money directly to the people who need it, without a bank, credit card company or charity organization taking fees from it. For example to:
2) Tip someone on reddit, twitter, ...
3) Got some digital content you could sell? It's easy with satoshi box.
4) Play Backgammon, Battleship and others person to person with someone from the other side of the world and win (or lose) bitcoin
5) And last but not least: I heared xHamster also accepts bitcoin. Watch porn with bitcoin and your wife/girlfriend will never find an embarrassing note on your credit card statement ;)

I admit I am heavily addicted to bitcoin. Checking prices, reddit, segwit adoption,..  several times per day. Love the price swings, love the hype stories, love the dramas, ... I just can't stop. It takes too much of my time and I get nothing done anymore. Time for a break! I can do it!...
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:55:16
I'm sure that is true. There is a pattern in the posts. It's also really cheap to pay some people for that, so whoever is doing it, they can go on for a long time.
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:27:22
That would crash the price, but not destroy bitcoin. It would recover and investors would be more confident afterwards because the satoshi uncertainty is gone.
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:08:40
Looks pretty accurate. I just wait until the price goes negative and buy lots! Thanks. Have a donut. @_date: 2017-02-24 14:41:08
Bitcoin has come too far. It's really hard to destroy it now. Can't think of anything really. A lot of things can cause a price crash, but that happened many times in the past and bitcoin always recovered. My only worry is that governments and big corporations manage somehow to gain more influence and control over bitcoin with huge mining operations and compromising key developers so they can change it in their favor.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:00:47
Yeah, DiscussFish and Antminer are doing this and I saw some unknown miners. But only sometimes even though there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, so I wonder how they decide when to do it. There must be some advantage for them to do in at a certain time.

@_date: 2017-02-21 17:42:13
Well it's better to settle it quickly. The ETH situation should be avoided. The exchanges have to make up their mind which coin to trade. If they don't trade the new fork it will loose as miners will not be able to sell their coins and hashing power drops. Most exchanges will probably trade both as this brings most profits but may not list it so quickly. But with their self set time limit Gemini has to decide quickly if they trade the fork or not. So in a way the ETF if approved will have a lot of power to decide which chain is the winning one in case of a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:29:53
Oh, no. Stop it! You just make it harder for me. Damnit! ;-) anyway, will be fun to catch up after 1 week.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:29:30
That is true as well. But there will always be some persons who have more influence then others. Developers, Exchanges, big hodlers,... hopefully it will all balance out and bitcoin shows to be resistant to politics as well.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:29:27
That makes sense. I guess there will probably also be several space full nodes floating around in our solar system. A bitcoin transaction to the international space station should be possible already. We should ask an astronaut to install a bitcoin wallet. That would be the first bitcoin transaction into space!
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:54:59
How would you sell even small amounts? It would be noticed if any of Satoshi's bitcoins move and if sold through an exchange his Identity would be revealed. The Feds would be all over him. The price would probably drop dramatically. Maybe he could sell in underground markets, but even then, the movement of his coins would still be noticed and have an effect...
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:10:12
I think it's a normal reaction especially from technical people to almost any new idea or from average people when confronted with new technology. Usually people are sceptical and don't think it will work. I experienced this many times when I discussed about bitcoin and some ideas I have. This can be frustrating, but on the other hand I think it is also helpful. Because that makes you reflect about your ideas and maybe see some flaws in it. But if you are really convinced about your idea and believe in yourself you will just do it despite everybodies negativity. That's how many successful companies got established.
Here are some suggestions how you can help the bitcoin community:
- regularly attend your local bitcoin meetups and try to grow the number of participants
- educate people , maybe start a bitcoin club in your university
- as a dev, contribute to open source projects like OpenBazaar, Coinffeine, ...
- convince some local stores to accept bitcoin, support them with making bitcoin integration as easy as possible

@_date: 2015-01-03 14:50:02
I keep buying about 50€ to 100€ every month if I can affort. Learned not to care so much about the price anymore. If you believe in bitcoin and you're not a trader any price is good. Bought some evil BTC at 666.66$ 'cause I thought it's kind of cool.
I try to increase my monthly BTC spending and explore new services. The rest is long term investment.

I like the idea of establishing an own country. A tropical bitcoin island would be awesome (no FIAT money accepted)! Here, have a country @_date: 2017-02-05 16:28:40
Yeah, I wouldn't wait so long.  Of cause in the beginning bitcoin will crash at least 50% I guess. But a few hours after BU will be listed on an exchange it will become clear that bitcoin is winning. Then I would sell at least half the BU coins for original bitcoin and you can even profit from it long term. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:03:56
Maybe he is, maybe not. I wonder if he destroyed the private keys before he died. If he is dead, would be the best if they would be unspendable and cannot fall into wrong hands.
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:24:39
Yeah, I expect a similar outcome as with the ETH split. Although this time it might be a more close race. I guess the BU supporters will try to push the price of their coin up in the beginning and they have deep pockets. It really depends on who of the old big hodlers are willing to quickly sell they bitcoin on the BU chain.
I for sure will emediately sell half of the BU coins and the rest when it's clear that BU is loosing. Made a good profit from the ETH/ETC split. So if they want to play hard, just let them come and burn all their money :)

I think it's very difficult to generate customized addresses. I know there exist some with few custom letters or one word, but such long custom text address is very, very unlikely to generate. Not sure what are the chances.

I was wondering if anyone from the Core Team talked to Jihan Wu recently. From the history of bitmain and his big investment in bitcoin I am sure he wants bitcoin to succeed as much as we all do. I have never met him, but my feeling is that he is just using BU to show his importance in the community and to negotiate a compromise for scaling. It's clear that without his support segwit will never activate. Maybe it's a cultural issue and he just wants be be treated respectfully, who knows. That's why I think it's important to talk to him. Take a good interpreter and find out what he really wants and show some respect.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:38:12
For a new independent currency I think it's too late due to bitcoins network effect. Many have tried and failed. A Government sponsored coin might have a chance but to create a better global digital currency all countries in the world would need to cooperate and give up control, which is not going to happen. Not even all countries in Europe can agree on something. Actually it's going in the opposite direction. That's why we need bitcoin. It's the only thing that can bring the world together.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:37:32
Plot twist: he was compromised by the chinese government and they want him to get control of the network otherwise shut down his business. He is actually saving bitcoin with agressive shitposting so the community takes away power from miners.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:18:09
"Our blockchain"? I didn't know the blockchain belongs to a certain group of people. Bitcoin is an inclusive and permissionless system which I think is one of the greatest properties of bitcoin. You can of cause have an opinion about it but their use of the blockchain is totally fine if they pay the fees and they don't have to ask anyone's permission. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:41:50

I agree. Expected much worse. It was fun though to watch during the dump. The curves below went totally nuts! And there was a funny gif saying "AAAAAAhhhhh". I was too stunned and forget to make a screenshot. Anyone got it?
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:55:57
Same here. Will dump all BU coins as soon as possible. The side which is confident and brave enough to dump most coins on the other chain will win. Hash rate follows price, not the other way round.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:21:27
Thought exactly the same this morning. It seems like investors throw money at everything that mentions blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized, ... without checking what they actually do. I remember during the dot com bubble all you had to do is check which stock didn't rise exponentially yet, buy it and wait for the rally. Feels same now in the altcoin market. But same as with the dot com bubble, the crypto bubble will burst at some point. And left will be only the once with serious potential like bitcoin, ethereum, and a few others. 
Hope I get it right this time. Fucked up in 2000.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:18:12
I wouldn't say this applies to everything. Stocks for example have a fixed number of shares (until new shares are issued) and other commodities like oil have quite unpredictable supply. Gold shares similar properties with btc and the supply of new mined gold is relatively stable.

No, it's been in the news over a year ago. Anyway awesome to see them using this cutting edge technology. This shows how bitcoin mining is leading the way to more energy efficiency in the IT industry. That's what people don't see who complain about bitcoin mining being a "waste" of energy.

Where? I've only seen 999.5 at coinbase. So close!!!
@_date: 2017-01-19 17:39:42
Correct and it goes both ways. Bitcoin miners cannot be used for anything else than SHA256 and supercomputers are useless for mining bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-31 07:19:07
Exactly! I always thought of litecoin as a pretty useless copy of bitcoin until now. Finally it can be useful and show bitcoin the way to go. I can understand that the big pools want to test segwit first on a real value chain before activating it for bitcoin.

Looks really like they can't pull themself out of the shit. It's just getting deeper with every fork.

@_date: 2017-01-01 19:23:39
That's also true of cause and I simplified a lot. But now since bitcoin mining is a series business I assume most mining companies have to sell there bitcoins regularly to cover their costs. Similar to gold mining. Of cause there may still be some home miners who hodl all their mined coins but probably a minority.
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:31:00

There are a few places in Tokyo who accept it, but much less than you would expect in a city like that. I haven't used a bitcoin ATM. 
But I definitely recommend going to the weekly meetup there if you have the chance. The community is awesome and meetups are well attended.
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:57:05
Ok you are right about the people. Maybe backing is the wrong word. But the hashing power protects the value and makes it incredibly hard to create new bitcoins. Without the strength of the network I doubt that people would be willing to give it that much value. If something is easy to get people don't think it's worth much. But if you have to put in a lot of work to get it, it has more value.

Nice map. No need to delete all countries without own currency. All european countries are in it for example and then again the EUR as total.

@_date: 2016-12-01 10:57:07
This is already going on for years. It's not gonna come anytime soon. I was quite impatient with the ETF in the past, but now I actually prefer to wait a bit longer. Surely it would be good for bitcoins overall acceptance and it would probably take the price to the moon quite quickly. But I see bitcoin as the peoples money. Therefore I would prefer to see more adoption of normal people, especially in developing countries first, before the old money flows in. So ideally after LN is launched.

Bitcoin is designed in the way that it doesn't rely on good will, trickery or some agreement with miners. As long as bitcoin has value there will be miners mining. There is profit to be made and somebody is always going to take it. It's as simple as that.

It's build on Ethereum but you can use bitcoin for predictions. It doesn't have to be one or the other. I believe Bitcoin and Ethereum can coexist well in the future. I hope augur will be a great example for that and show the advantages of both.

Actually there was a proposal to expand the canvas when it was full, let's call it r/place unlimited. But then a lot of the great mashup art wouldn't have happened and none of the awesome fights. By keeping the canvas limited only the best non-controversal art pieces survive. I think it's a great analogy to the current state of bitcoin.

There are a lot of foreigners shopping in these stores. So I think this is quite useful. Especially for all the chinese it's a convenient way to convert their bitcoin profits into expensive consumer electronics.
I will surely try it out during my next Japan visit.

I like to believe that he keeps the coins to protect bitcoin against a major attack from countries or corporations until it is mainstream. Then at some point he airdrops 99% of his coins to all addresses that hold less than 1btc. if he doesn't do this he is probably dead or destroyed the keys long ago.

Yes they did, but management told the engineer to hide it as it would damage their film business. lol

He could have done also one big transaction to multiple addresses. I think Electrum has this function. In that case the fees shouldn't be so high.

The beauty is that Bitcoin is truly global now. One country making bitcoin illegal would not stop it. To be effective all countries would have to agree to a worldwide ban. Otherwise that country would just be left behind innovation. China cut off his own leg by shutting down exchanges. Japan is gladly taking over the lead which I believe makes them even more angry. If governments want to have at least a little control they have to keep playing the game.

Thanks for the clarification. Yes that actually makes me feel a little better, although I don't understand the reasoning of BCC and 2X supporters. For OB to be used by millions of people bigger blocks won't be enough. It needs LN or another second layer solution to be successful. I really appreciate your effort to keep the project open. I'll try out the new release when I find time. It looks really nice.

We should also thank the B2X guys. The attack motivated a lot of people to start running a node :-)
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:34:46
this doesn't make any sense. dumping B2X is a good strategy to push the price down and beat B2X. lower price -&gt; lower profitability for miners -&gt; miners mine BTC -&gt; B2X chain slowly dies. whoever bought the coins looses.

Awesome! now who from the B2X camp is brave enough to bet against these guys? As we have seen with BCH most proponents chicken out when it comes to real money. B2X will tank as soon as it can be traded on an exchange and that was it.

Thanks for the great post. I am a lender on BTCjam and can confirm the good experience. Transparency and good communication is key for me when investing in risky loans.

I agree that to keep bitcoin truly independent a stable fee market is needed. But I can imagine that mining in the long run may not be about profit anymore but more about control/influence. If bitcoin becomes THE world currency and is widely used in the global economy and perhaps even as reserve currency, there is a lot of incentive for big corporations and governments to mine just to gain a stake in the system for securing their interest, regardless of mining profitability.

Lets be honest, counterparty is dead. There is nothing interesting happening and it's quite difficult to use. Storj switching to ethereum was the last nail in the coffin. RSK is the future for bitcoin. Hope Storj will come back at some point.

Well in that case, just look at the performance of the GBP this year. Unless you don't mind your savings loosing in value that should be enough reason to get some btc.

It allows 100tps and instant payments. Segwit is not needed for that as far as I understand.

I noticed I have somehow the power to influence the price movement. As soon as I intend to transfer money to the exchange the price rallies up. When the money finally arrives, right after I bought btc the price goes down again. :-P

It's definitely not a bubble. That's when the price goes 10x in a short time frame. Look at the altcoin market. That's more like a bubble and when that pops all the money is coming back to btc. That doesn't mean a short term correction cannot happen. But I am quite sure until the end of the year we will be much higher than now. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:38:54
Ok I checked it out. Team looks solid. But again another new blockchain? I don't see the point unless ist offers something completely new. RSK and Ethereum makes more sense for me long term.

Yeah, cashing out big amounts through normal exchanges will be difficult. You better try the OTC market and get a good tax consultant. 
Another way is to buy a house with a short term loan like 5 years and pay off monthly by cashing out bitcoin slowly. The nice side effect will be that you can still profit from potential price rise of bitcoin.
