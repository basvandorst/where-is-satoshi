Yeah that's true. But it's fun to think about it. 
Maybe it will be a viable thing once we have ASICs produced on a Moon base where it doesn't cost too much to launch something into orbit.

You can use FPGAs, so you can always just upload the latest mining algorithm

maybe they're tired of seeing the dev slacking off.
\- Is this Bitcoin thing still working Bob?
\- Yeah it's still working \*sips from coffee \*goes back browsing reddit

With FPGAs you do hardware programming. You can do a better hardware design for an FPGA in a similar way as you design a new ASIC.

Yeah probably it is like that :D the view could be nice though

We don't know. Dollar cost average on the way down in small amounts. Take small amounts of profits on the way up, once we are back to ATH. Take big chunk of profits if it's a life changing amount for you. 
I think about it like a hobby. I can justify spending 50-100 dollars in a month on my cryptocurrency hobby. I never sell for a loss, I play around with it, try out some use cases, learn things in the process. If after several years there's still no major bullrun then I consider stop buying, until then it's good enough of a hobby like anything else, don't stress about it.

Bitcoin transactions are not private. They are recorded on the blockchain for life, where anyone can look them up, so that's not that big of a concern. 
They can't really control it, but they can continue to spy on their citizens with it. I don't think bitcoin would be among their first choices, but it is certainly an option.
