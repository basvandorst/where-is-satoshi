Wow thank you guys ! I have some questions though. So I dont get any notice's when you replied to my comment, so I could know? Is that some setting on reddit I have to set ? The only way I knew to look at this page again was because I never closed it on my tabs in my browser

I feel the same. I was nervous and loosing faith when i saw $320 now I feel stupid for not risking more and what I did risk initially was at $397 . Greed makes me feel like I missed more, plus the profits are not really profits for me since i still have to cover my initial learning curve of selling at a loss when i first started and knew nothing.

I have never received a tip, would be nice to see how change tip works :-)

haha Yea but I keep wondering when I should sell to cover my initial loss then wait till it drops a lot then buy a lot on the dip to realize profits . With my luck if I sell now its to the moon an no more big dips .

Asking :-) and I have a question as I am new to reddit. So I dont get any notice's when some one replies to my comment? Is that some setting on reddit I have to set ? The only way I would know to look at this page again is if I never closed it on my tabs in my browser
