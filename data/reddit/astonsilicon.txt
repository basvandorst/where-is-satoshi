Wifes pay-day, tis a good day to purchase some of those yummy bitcoins and hodl them like a troll. Also one of my good buddies is sending me a free Ledger Nano S that he had as an extra just laying around unopened, slowly but surely stacking them sats.

I have a little in XRP that i just hold, whats going on with XRP?
Edit: Just googled XRP and found this article 
Thats a bummer, looks like I'll be converting my XRP to more Sats.

I do trust him. He's actually the one that got me into Bitcoin a few months ago, he's been teaching me the ways ever since.

So how many fake Satoshi's have their been? This weekend it seemed like everyone already knew the reveal was BS, which got me thinking, how many times has this happened before?

Kinda bummed, one of my co-workers seems to have signed up for some kinda of MLM bitcoin scheme(vbit). I almost feel responsible, ive been blabbing about bitcoin for the last two months to everyone who would listen, I did tell him though, first rule of bitcoin not your keys not your bitcoin.
