You know how a pyramid scheme works right? In order for Bitcoin to be a pyramid scheme there has to be a concentrated power at top who control everything. So who is it? What's the power at top? Calling it a pyramid scheme is autistic, calling it a risky investment is valid

The transaction is in the recipients wallet, but it's unconfirmed. Doesn't it need to be confirmed before it's useable

You have an explanation?

Dude, I have no idea. It was .008518 btc transaction with a .0000187 fee. (Not a lot of money ik but a lot for me)

 It feels just GREAT being under 18 and in New York,  I get raped with inflated prices on LBC and paxful to the point that at the lowest it dipped I would still be paying just under 7 thousand a BTC. FUCKING FANTASTIC

That's why it's hard to enjoy the DNM and Bitcoin

We've been shrugging off "crashes" for a while now. The significant dip in early September, and most recently the dip following all the 2x shit, both quickly being shoved aside. I don't know, even if we were to crash all the way to 1,000 I wouldn't be surprised if it went up to 8k a few weeks after

Because I'm not a naive, I was talking about the present, and presently I'd say a solid 80% of goods exchanged using bitcoin are illegal substances. Nobody outside of Venezuela is using bitcoin I buy beets
