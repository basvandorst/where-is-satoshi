I'm talking about a scenario like this:
Lightning Network hubs will be created and a few will be dominant, that way, people do not constantly have to open channels as there's already a path from user A to user B. For user B to actually receive/own the Bitcoin there has to be an on-chain transaction; what prevents the hub owner to forge the on-chain transaction and say it went somewhere else?
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:34:44
See jbaum517's comment.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:48:41
I have no proposal and that's why I'm not submitting any. But the Lightning Network is being implemented and those flaws are the reason Bitcoin even exists. But maybe I'm missing something, hence, me asking.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:35:31
So, not only can they steal it, they can forge local transactions to print money. That is exactly what I was scared for.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:45:54
You should be able to generate the same BTC address using the same seeds as you used for your BCH wallet and access your funds from there.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:55:32
It's beneficial because it effectively gets rid of cash and enables tracking anyone and their activities. That gives them control, not the people.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:02:39
Why can't the Lightning Network hub owner decide to 'take' everything by sending everything went to him on-chain?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:55:11
You don't need exchanges; when they reduce block sizes because of a 2nd layer solution, you do need hubs. Hubs that will be subject to KYC/AML. Big difference.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:46:07
You know what used to be considered the safest investment out there? The reason Bitcoin was invented. The American house market.
Stop reading fake news.

If you're buying something, fiat comes into play.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:00:50
On-chain transactions are much more difficult to regulate. LN hubs will be ran by companies, and people will not want to pay fees for new channels all the time. So, there will be oligopolies and they will be regulated. That's how it always is, no matter how much I want you to be right.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:49:01
The entire point of Bitcoin was to be your own bank. Trusted third party settlements will effectively destroy the idea of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:06:01
You're missing the point. There will be hubs, they will take a piece of the pie by having channels open. This is a business model. Govt's will force these companies to have KYC and AML as they did with exchanges. Simple as that.
The LN has nothing to do with TOR and using TOR or a VPN is an extremely bad idea when dealing with a currency that is not protected by a third party.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:56:50
It's implicit; a logical result of implementing a 2nd layer solution.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:15:56
Correct, given it worked out like that which it never does.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:15:05
Well, if you're buying something, fiat comes into play. But yes, and that is the key difference; you cannot regulate on-chain transactions, you can however regulate LN hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:56:36
There will be hubs and you do have to trust them (with your personal information) as they will be subject to KYC and AML regulations. The technology itself is entirely irrelevant when the fundamentals of it will allow governments to regulate Bitcoin almost entirely. Again, this will destroy the idea of Bitcoin.

Jihan Wu, a big player in the mining world, i.e. owner of multiple pools and CEO of the company who produces Antminer (the hardware used by miners to mine Bitcoin) has been pushing for bigger block-sizes for awhile now (S2X). Most likely to make mining more profitable.
Bitcoin Core (the people who create the software client for Bitcoin wallets) are strongly against increasing block-sizes as it makes Bitcoin more centralized and less secure. The reason for that is because the hardware and money required to mine would increase and due to the centralization a 51% attack would be easier to execute because there is less people to corrupt.
At some point 95%~ of miners were signalling for S2X but they have been losing support, slowly. S2X is expected at 16 November. It's a hostile take-over attempt by Jihan Wu &amp; large corporations. If S2X-chain ends up winning, then Bitcoin is no more.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:05:11
Just use a hard wallet, i.e. Electrum or Core. Not your keys, not your coin. Coinbase has proven over and over again that all they want is centralization, and everything that goes against Bitcoin.

Yes, fortunately I have had the luck to explore most parts of the world. Incl, most of the ones that wouldn't be safe to travel to nowadays. What about you?
How is it not on par with that of a 2nd world country? Its life expectancy certainly seems on par, the fact that there's no health insurance too, its Gini definitely looks that way, the huge deficits, the fact that it's not an AAA country, the amount of hunger and poverty, the amount of homeless people and drug addicts dwelling around on cemented pavements (topnotch 2nd world country stuff), the horrible food quality even in expensive restaurants, the chloride in water, are you serious? All the people that fake happiness - feeling confused as to why they're sad in the *best* country of the world /s - but are clearly facing utter depression; I can go on and on. 
I didn't mean to offend you. I genuinely feel bad for U.S. citizens.

The fact they are starting a mine farm is golden. The start of a global mining war of nations ensures the existence of Bitcoin as well as the end of chainsplits. On top of that: Moscow's stock market is implementing Bitcoin exchange which will boost the value of Bitcoin a whole lot. Not a single other country has contributed to Bitcoin in any way, they at most, allow it.

Well, if you feel like the Chinese government will ensure a smooth transition from unlicensed to licensed with exchange companies and also think the market thinks the same way then this would be a good time to buy.
Personally, I think there will be a slow bleed or a very stagnant time until there is certainty (i.e. being sure that exchanges won't randomly shutdown, even temporarily).
Keep in mind that "the market" wants to make money, they don't do HODLing. If they already sold, they'll want the lowest price possible whether that is the bottom of the bleeding (assuming that Chinese gov't will ensure smooth transition) or the bottom after the (temporary) exchange shutdown.
Well, that's my 50 coins. Ha-ha.
