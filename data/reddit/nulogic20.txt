If you think how credit cards operate is similar to how bitcoin transactions operate, *you* are an idiot.

How will it ever go mainstream if things like this are happening?

I'm keeping the old computer but thank you for the heads up.

BTC has too many flaws to ever gain mainstream functionality.

Nice, a few kids in your class knew about Bitcoin, therefore "an impressive amount of intelligent high school students know about Bitcoin." Sounds like something an intelligent high school student would say.

I don't get how that is a counter to what I said.

But it didn't. How can we expand public interest in Bitcoin when price volatility  prevents someone from making a purchase without losing their money?

The fact of the matter is, I could have spent X amount of dollars to make this purchase yesterday with fiat. Instead, it's costing me X + Y. You can ignore my **problems** if you'd like but these are problems that are going to affect the future of Bitcoin as a whole.

I'll look for that, thank you.

Which whole folder to be exact? 
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:38:33
Not really. The fact that transactions are not instant is pretty simple to understand.

Right because nothing is more impressive than using anecdotal evidence to spew bullshit on the internet.

I didn't purchase BTC to make an investment, I purchased it to make a purchase. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:15:32
How does any of that change my situation?

Is this app available on the iPad? I can't seem to find it.
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:16:27
BTC is supposed to be a currency though, is it not?
