Just hold on to it. Don't sell and it will swing back up

Apple was run the same way now than when Steven Jobs ran it. People are just starting to notice how shitty the company is. 
Its always been that way.

I clicked on it expecting rectangle pizza.

Apple are the Nazis of the tech world. This is why I will never buy an apple product. It comes locked to the company

Well I'm just not bothering with it anymore. Back then it was so easy to mine, just hook up a PC with an AMD graphics card and after a couple of months you'd have a bitcoin

I had a bitcoin or two mined back in 2011.. totally lost that hard drive

I feel that this is the exact reason as to why bitcoin might fail. The fact that you have to do this to make a transfer is going to stop a lot of people from having them on their pcs. 
If the point is to not have a central agency do the transactions having it on your own devices would be the primary solution. 
I'm optimistic, but something needs to be worked out here.

I am just using GUIminer. I don't know if there is one with more Mhash for my card.. but GUIminer was just so damn easy to set up.

You're hoping for ASIC rigs? I thought everyone here on reddit doesn't like them?
I'm still unsure what they are lol
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:16:23
Do they have LTC pools? Or would it be worth it to just solo mine?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:11:51
LTC as in litecoin?
I don't think my card gets a good khash. 
Its a Nvidia GTX 560ti

It appears as though the cgminer host site is down :/

Does anyone have any tips that could maybe improve my mhash?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:27:34
Maybe I will make the switch and grab a few LTC while I still can.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:21:40
lol well yeah i know with enough digging you can find just about anything on google. The idea of asking for someones advice is that it is more wisdom + a quicker response!
Cheers though for tipping me off about LTC. I have heard of it but never really looked into it.

I'm using 1 card.. Just the one I already had so there is no additional investment. 
Nvidia GTX 560ti
90 mhash/s 
I know its poor, but every bit counts.
