Here is the contradiction: How could I, as the owner of the wallet hand over the keys which I don't know?
I think you might be partitioning the (human) user of the software and the software itself. (i.e., the software knows the keys and can send them over, but the user never sees them). Unfortunately this would mean your proposal would rely on software developers to always be good actors. What prevents me from writing my own wallet app that keeps the keys and takes the money after the merchant gives me the goods?

It seems like the exchange will still know where the USD came from and which lightning channel it was deposited to, no?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:39:54
You seem like someone who knows that they are talking about. Do you know if there is a risk of flooding/overwhelming the tor network if lightning integration spreads?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:12
How much work would it be for 3rd parties to implement lightning network compatibility?
Have companies like bitpay, sqaure and coinbase indicated they will roll out support? It seems like this is mostly beneficial to transaction apps, but unfortunately both sides of the transaction need to support lightning.
Also, what is the expected timeframe to see true release on the mainnet?

I am working on decentralized browser along the same lines, you can find the source on github:
I am working on a blog post describing it in more detail. I would love to look at integrating your proof of bandwidth idea.

Damnit, I just moved from Austin to Boston. I wonder if Boston has a bitcoin meetup
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:29:22
Yeah a "source" said that

Aw crap, I've been working on literally this same application for the past few weeks. The only difference is I am using Bittorrent Sync and planned on using some implementation of colored coins for the DNS system.
I was planning on pushing it up to github in a week or two. I am probably going to keep working on it, because it's fun... but crap

Indigogo has a "flexible funding" option where you keep the money even if you don't hit your goal.

Developer here. I would love to replace btsync with an open source alternative. However no mature replacements yet exist. The best shot so far seems to be clearskies: 
I will swap it in as soon as it is robust.

If you've ever sent money from your mobile phone, or sent money while connected to wifi then you too have sent money by radio waves.

It can either use DHT or a centralized tracker. You can read more here: 
Does your btsync clone present the same API as the official one? If so I'd love to try it out.
@_date: 2014-01-22 01:29:33
Because it is cool technology. I figure someone will make an open source clone sooner or later and then I will just swap it in.

Hey, I am a scientific Python/Matlab programmer as well!
I am working on a decentralized web browser that uses BitTorrent Sync and Colored Coins (built on top of bitcoin). I've got most of the btsync stuff done, but havent started on the colored coins integration.
If you feel like helping out you can find the source on github here: (its all python)
Let me know if you want to chat more. I am working on a blog post that explains it in better detail.

GPS was never a hobby project. It started as a military project with (probably) millions of USD in funding.

Long term bitcoin HODLer here, but TBH this isn't a great thing for bitcoin. Encouraging spending is usually seen as a positive.

This seems to legitimize B2X. They confirmed they will support send and receive (as well as buying and selling I assume) for B2X within 48 hours of the fork. This would be just the 4th coin that coinbase adds after bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum, which has historically boosted the price and the legitimacy of the coin in the broader public's eye.
Coinbase also stated they are willing to reconsider the names BTC and B2X at some point in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:32:38
My point is that the only other "shitty altcoins" that coinbase supports are Ethereum and Litecoin, which are both fairly well regarded compared to other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:12:20
I was just quoting the guy I was responding to, hence the use of quotes.
In the same sentence I called Ethereum a fairly well regarding altcoin
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:40:37
In the accompanying blog post Coinbase indicates they will support send *and receive*. I assume that since you can deposit your B2X there you will also be able to buy and sell it on their exchange, but I have not seen them state that explicitly.

If I hold all my coins in the Blockchain iOS app will I be able to spend them on either chain?

Would it be illegal for those making this decision for eBay to buy a lot of coins before they announce their decision to accept BTC?
