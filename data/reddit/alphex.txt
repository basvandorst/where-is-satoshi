not enough.

Holy crap. I wish it went down to 450.  I'd buy a lot. 
This is a long term gamble.  I'm in for the stretch.

1.  Never tell anyone this ever again. And delete this reddit account.  And maybe any other social media accounts with the same name 
2.  Put that broke Laptop in a fire box for safe keeping. 
3.  Read about using Ubuntu to mount a windows fat32 or NTFS drive as read only.     The go buy a external enclosure and see what you can accomplish.    You don’t need Ubuntu. But it might give you some more options 
4.  There are windows password cracking tools you can use.   
5.   Take your time and be patient in this process.    Assuming there’s no physical damage. Or data corruption you will get your coins back.  
(Assuming you didn’t have any crazy encryption on the drive)
I would say also, go take some computer repair and system admin classes to learn how to recover this drive.    If that costs a few thousand dollars.  It’s worth it if it makes you a millionaire. 
Good luck!

Anyone pro Trump isn't worth supporting.

Wealthy or poor.  
He's a racist sociopathic narsassist maniac who is allowing fascism to gain hold in this country all the while destroying any semblance of respect and dignity we had as a nation on the world stage.   
Soooo.  Yeah.   Don't support him.

Doesn't matter if they are or aren't trying to steal it.  This is due process.  Get a lawyer!!!
