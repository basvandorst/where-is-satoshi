Do you by any chance work for them?
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:22:54
Ah okay thanks, how can I send money as euros rather than GBP?

BitBargain looks great! Signing up now!
What will stop them from scamming? :L

So all the bitcoins that I "buy off bitstamp" are actually being sold to me by other bitstamp users?
@_date: 2013-09-22 18:06:46
Ah I forgot to mention that I am in UK

Why does a bitcoin seller have to be "shady". Anyway, if you meet in a public place, you would be relatively safer. 
Furthermore, I can fend for myself against older thugs.

I've got in touch with all sellers, and despite listing themselves in my area, they are actually 100 miles away &gt;.&lt;

What did you do for government issued ID?

C'mon babyyyy, hopefully we will never go below!

My Bank --&gt; BitStamp USD Funds --&gt; Bitcoin
How does Bitstamp get the BTC for me?
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:29:05
Haha, I actually laughed xD
But I'm glad he posted it, I didnt see it yesterday!
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:36:49
Hmm, I'm checking my bank website (Barclays), and as the Bitstamp's bank account is international, I will have to pay like £25 in fees =/
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:23:14
What currency did you send as?
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:55:15
Any alternative you would recommend?
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:49:12
This site looks very "new". Can anyone vouch that it is legitimate and works with ease?
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:40:21
So even though your ID said you were under 18, they accepted you? You didn't photoshop it etc.?
So if I send it my driver's license, which clearly says I was born in 1996. (17 years old), they will accept me?
Thanks for the help btw

Does it have an individual relationship with the BTC seller?
It is an automated system?
How does it do it so fast?
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:21:09
Yeah, the downside of BitBargain is the huge mark-up on the market price.
@_date: 2013-09-27 18:53:45
Damn! That sucks :'(
I wish I had applied after work one day or something :L
