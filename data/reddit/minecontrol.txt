You seem to be misunderstanding that banks and banking are not being disrupted by Bitcoin. Blockchain technology is something they are looking into to enhance the way banks communicate with each other and hold the database of transactions.
Banks offer services and financial products which won't at all be disrupted by either Bitcoin or blockchain. 
Regulation holds the keys to disruption in the banking industry.

So much hype defining Bitcoin as the unicorn in the room but in reality, what applications is it currently providing that are changing anything? 
Yes it offers a direct remittance but serves problems on both ends of the conversion. 
The real die hards here are interested in holding only to convert when the unicorn delivers big profits... Which probably won't be happening.

Tldr... But this is exactly why decentralisation doesn't work. You can't please all of the people all of the time and the pecking order you have described surely shouldn't exist in a true decentralised system? The power is actually in the hands of the devs 100%.

Gold  / cash 50% loss over 15 years? Are you actually making that argument? 
Absolutely everything cost X 15 years ago and is now valued at Y. 
Bitcoin volatility means a $1000 order this hour might turn into $700 value in the next hour. I accept it might also be $1200 but businesses can not run that kind of risk on their trading. 
By the same token, everyone wetting their panties over banking institutions getting involved with blockchain technology should realise that banks can not handle the variance to take a transaction worth X and settle it minutes later worth Y where that variance could be 4 or 5% over billions.

No you are wrong. Companies didn't invest in any swaps, banks did.
Think about your monthly expenditure and where that goes. Your phone bill, groceries, gas, etc. Think about your local businesses, the dry cleaner, takeaway and so on. 
Now ask yourself, can those businesses afford to operate with Bitcoin and risk the massive price fluctuations we currently see. 
Don't say "they can transfer to fiat immediately". In which case they will accept fiat and remain exactly as they are. 
For major companies turning over serious money, they work with banks because they trust them to provide facilities which enable the company to operate smoothly and also they keep their money safe. 
If a company is to be its own bank there suddenly becomes some huge problems.
Infrastructure, staff, security, and yes trust, because now they have to trust their own infrastructure, staff and security systems to be their own bank with millions in turnover. 
Your local dry cleaner might have a cash collection agreement with an armoured truck and armed guards... Because they want their cash to be securely transferred to a safe place. 
Businesses already have a hard enough time protecting against hacking and now you want everyone to be their own bank. 
But they can have this crazy hard password system... Great, how will that actually work on a daily basis with accounting teams needing to process hundreds perhaps thousands or tens of thousands of supplier payments each month? 
Companies feel safe with their current banking methods because they receive a service at a fee. Bitcoin doesn't make it free, it brings new problems to the table for a company who doesn't want disruption they just want service. 
Banks are working on fintech, some of that tech includes blockchain style technology. They will implement some features to ensure they and their customers can evolve in a safe and secure way. They won't be looking at using Bitcoin and its blockchain and even if they were that would defeat the purpose most Bitcoin followers stand for.
The fintech development departments will have hundreds of talented developers... Bitcoin can't even get its block size debate sorted.
The more I read the more I feel that this sub is becoming 4chan for unicorn believers and at some point in the near future you'll all be left holding your Betamax bitcoins while the banking industry standardises a new vhs.

And the net effect on BTC will be zero. 
Bitcoin has been a phenomenal experiment and certainly a good idea but unfortunately it's not user friendly enough to unseat the one belief system bigger than religion... Money. 
It's really time to face facts... the price has remained stable for a long time and despite the huge investments being made adoption isn't taking place and the price isn't heading anywhere near the moon. 
I'm not saying it's over but it's pretty obvious that bitcoin isn't going to take over the world following a euro default and if that isn't enough then nothing ever will be.

You are trying to be reassured against an issue which doesn't exist. 
If Ghash launched an attack their business would be instantly ruined. What would they gain? A small period of time where they might gain some extra coins but in the grand scheme of things not nearly enough to recompense them for what they would ultimately lose. 
Owning the BTC protocol would cause the price to crash and the system to grind to a halt. 
Zero incentive for them to try. 
BTC is not some silly altcoin, it is now a very serious player in the world economy and shows signed of being one of the most important inventions ever. I'm sure Ghash know which side their bread is buttered. 
You really need to stop worrying about things based on what paranoid people post on the internet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:36:31
I have 15th points at Ghash and The only thing I'm concerned about is the amount of scare stories being posted here which are completely unfounded. 
Ghash has precisely zero incentive to launch an attack, have previously stated they would not and introduced measures to curtail their share of the market. 
It makes no sense for them to have heavily invested in building such a powerful mining operation, trading platform and overall BTC reliant business to harm the very protocol they support.
Constant scaremongering about Ghash is simply moronic and without foundation. 
The simple fact is Ghash provide the best terms and more revenue than other pools. 
Miners have invested heavily in equipment that suppliers failed to deliver on time and as such miners are desperate to recover their investment against all odds. 
The scaremongering against Ghash needs to stop it isn't helping the community.

I work in anti piracy, as someone else has commented, the artist or star isn't the entire product and many back office people well out of the lime light end up losing their jobs due to lack of revenues.
More importantly the author has missed the fact that actors / comedians will have been commissioned to make the shows this paid by the so called middle man who has effectively bank rolled the production of the entertainment you are consuming. 
Why people think non tangible digital goods are different to physical goods is beyond me. Theft is theft. 
Ultimately the real losers are the consumer because less investment is made in producing great new content. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 21:36:19
No. Your statement is false because 'Bitcoin' does not replace banks. At present Bitcoin is trying to replace money or currency. 
People need to start thinking rationally about the service their bank provides them and adjust the negativity towards them. 
Most current accounts are free of charge, they give you access to securely store your money and provide systems such as direct debits, standing orders, cards and ATMs.
For a fee you might enjoy an account which provides bundled benefits such as gold accounts which provide travel insurance, breakdown insurance, improved interest rates etc. 
I fail to see the evil in this. 
Banks also provide facilities for borrowing money be that loans, overdraught or credit cards. Failure to comply with the agreed terms will incur charges as would be fair in any contractual arrangement. 
Your Bitcoin wallet provides none of the above and is simply a wallet that you are responsible for the security of. This does not make you your own bank as many claim. It is exactly the same as running a pure cash wallet.
Consumer banking is not an evil industry, on the contrary it is probably the most useful and smooth operating service you receive at no cost to yourself if you are able to conduct your financial affairs within the framework. If your cell provider operated with such simplicity and level of service you would be praising them and recommending to friends. 
Investment banking is a different animal and central banking an altogether different story. Central banks control the money supply and there are undoubtedly issues with this that I do believe need to be put right. Bitcoin does not solve these issues, they can, and have in history, been resolved by governments removing central banking and its processes. 
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:17:39
You can't please all of the people all of the time. Decentralised basically means there will always be a divide as there isn't a single management deciding for you what you can and can't have with you choosing to use the service or not. 
This very fact will be the turn off for the general public and industry, it's not 'secure' in as much as there is no definitive road map or promise of service and this leaves uncertainty and lack of trust... Trust less actually means less trust for most. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:55:41
Sending money to the wrong place doesn't have to be that technical. "Request payment" buttons should replace wallet addresses I.e if I want to fund my localbitcoin acct i should have a button that sends an invoice to my wallet for payment. This would save copy and paste mistakes and creates that extra step of confirming that you entered YOUR wallet address to request payment rather than sending money to a random address. 
So far as refunds go I can't think past escrow services sitting between merchants and consumers as being the solution. In the real world Amazon as a merchant can be trusted, especially with a public ledger of proof in the blockchain. But private deals will require a trusted escrow option. 
Someone like bitpay need to provide an escrow service with paypal style arbitration in disputes. I know, I heard it, it's wrong, wrong wrong... But in reality if you want mass adoption it's going to need safeguards provided by trusted sources so that when things go wrong they can be fixed. 
Overall wallet addresses probably need to be claimed and given ownership titles that are made public for those that need to. If localbitcoins could tag each wallet address with their ownership tag it would be more obvious that you are sending coins to a specific entity. Random strings are random

I just don't get why BTC followers are supporting this guy and hoping he gets off. Silk Road was one of the biggest blights on BTC and its death marked the beginning of a huge price rise. He's not the poster boy for Bitcoin, he's not some saviour representing freedom from the man, he's just an outlaw who made a shit ton of money from facilitating drug deals and didn't know when to walk away and cash out.

"Banks can do nothing and be replaced by Bitcoin."
It's time you understood what service banks provide to businesses as well as the general public. 
Without banks, with laws and protocols passed down and protected by governments, I fear you might find it difficult to finance the chattels you so desire in your life. Do you think mortgages, car loans, business financing can simply disappear and the world remain able to function? 
Smart contract loans might very well become the new technology behind the service but these must be backed by institutional risk management, extreme finance and of course fees that match the provision. What difference therefore will there be between a bank or a Bitcoin bank? 
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:31:32
There is so much BS in the 'community' that it's hard to take anything seriously. 
Most 'supporters' are only in it to profit fiat in the event that Bitcoin peaks. There are several types of supporter who make various claims of what Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin will be. So far as I can see, right now it's simply a trading token / form of payment and everything else that has been promised (having tons of VC capital pumped in) hasn't materialised and either won't it doesn't really have real world use scenarios above and beyond the existing formats. 
Anarchists bang the drum on bringing down the banks (without any understanding of what service banks provide) and also support economic disaster in order to boost Bitcoin. 
Everyone claims to be a economist, financial expert trader and chart analyst... Predicting future price based on patterns and history without any factual reasoning for what's happening now or in the future.
People throw around terms like fungible as if they know what they mean. They make claims of Bitcoin changing the lives of the unbanked or enabling business X or service Y from benefiting from running on Bitcoin or the blockchain. 
They champion decentralisation whilst reaching for the moon when a bank or institution says they will work on blockchain technology. 
Praising startups then tearing them to pieces when they gain traction and run for profit, requiring them to work within regulations and laws.

OB is nothing like a killer app and is destined to fall on its arse. 
The demo given by the devs proved they are wasting their time on irrelevant elements and have given no focus to the real security and arbitration elements that PayPal / eBay provides.
I accept that there are buyers and sellers who have horrid experiences of being ripped off but on mass the user experience of eBay is first class and is exactly what drives its success. 
In fact, take that sentiment one stage further and you have the entire problem with decentralisation and Bitcoin in general. Be it banking, retail or any other service people are desperately trying to attach to Bitcoin or its blockchain, the existing real world systems actually rely on centralised trusted entities which is exactly what industry and consumers want. 
No adoption will be created by a market place that is under developed and at its core requires users to convert real money into magical internet money they don't understand.

I'm not shilling I'm telling you my opinion. 
You seem to ignore the  reality of news such as Steam accepting Bitcoin ... Won't Bitpau need to liquidate that usage to pay their retailer??
I think you will find there is no shortage of coins for sale  on exchanges and thus  price has remained fairly stable. Yesterday price increased because some people see excitement in the first classic block being mined. That saw people  willing to spend a few percent more to buy coins. 
As stated earlier, if you look at the order books you'll see many coins available in the spot +5% range.
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:36:23
Oh dear 
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:08:27
And how many coins are currently available at spot price +5%? 
You also assume that all freshly minted coins are instantly liquidated via exchanges and not held by the mining pools or their participants. 
I'd argue that given the fork situation you are likely about to see a decline in price and then hash power once halving becomes a reality. 
Price is driven by perceived value not scarcity because there is and will not be scarcity. There are many coins available for trade.  
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:11:10
No. If there was demand the price would rise, there isn't demand, there is usage. 
Retailer sells through bitpay or similar, bitpay liquidates to pay retailer. 
Hardly rocket science
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:19:48
72% already mined and you think they will be scarce after halving? Can you see the trade volumes on the exchanges? Yeah that's liquidity which really isn't going to change just because of halving.

Rubbish. I ran one of the worlds largest MP3 download stores and as such have a lot of experience with micro payments. 
Whilst I agree transaction fees become an issue at low value the actual problem is no revenue regardless of fees. How many $ do you think YouTube would earn with the OP's suggestion over the next year? Not enough to make it worth while doing the development work. 
Referring back to my statement about killer app potential... The vast majority of the population have no reason for anything to challenger their money belief system. Failing sovereign states has not managed to do it and if that won't I really can't see what will. 
Transaction fees / remittance is the best function I can see so far but I dare say if ever challenged on this front, the banking industry would quickly review its archaic charges to retain its everyday business.

Isn't the reality that two things are certain, death and taxes, for your school teachers to get paid and your garbage collected the government claims taxes from the population to cover costs.

You guys really need to stop coming up with 'Bitcoin' ideas that are so obviously easily achievable with PayPal, Apple Pay or any other payment system. 
Adding the word 'Bitcoin' doesn't make it a 'killer app'... It makes it less attractive to the provider since so few people use Bitcoin.
I have been wanting to make a killer app post for a while...

2c split with the content owner. Essentially no revenue and way below what they currently earn from advertisers. 
It makes no sense for YouTube for two simple reasons. 1.) they earn more from advertising which is their prime function.
2.) as others have pointed out, they would be better off with a monthly payment for you to skip adds... This need not be paid with Bitcoin. 
To make my point again, Bitcoin is not the answer to any problem here. Existing payment platforms could provide the solution to a problem which doesn't exist because the YouTube business model is advertisement delivery.

You must wake up, penny transactions are not going to convert the world into Bitcoin users... The hassle of transforming fiat into Bitcoin far outweighs the supposed feature of being able to skip an add. 
As I said, blind faith isn't going to make you rich from your BTC holdings. There needs to be a serious business case presented in a rational way.
