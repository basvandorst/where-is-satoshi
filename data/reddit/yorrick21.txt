Consumer adoption is completely stagnant.

All of these use cases - with perhaps your remittance example - are so incredibly niche that they aren't even noteworthy. *"Use bitcoin to solve your yard sale conundrum"* could just as easily be used to mock bitcoin, as it could to try and convince people of its usefulness.

No he doesn't. But he does need incentive to use bitcoin, or else this entire discussion becomes irrelevant.
Example: I can send money (USD) instantly to anyone with either an email address or a mobile phone number. This is a service my bank provides today. The drawback is that it goes through PayPal, which incurs a fee on the receiver's end, but it's an easy transaction which requires no currency conversion.
And it's successful. Not having to deal with bitcoin is worth paying a fee.
Will this change? No one knows. But we most certainly haven't seen a "killer app" since most people will actively avoid bitcoin whenever and wherever possible.

This problem doesn't require bitcoin to solve.

True, although to be fair, bitcoin requires set-up too. And people overall are much more receptive to working with an established company like PayPal and a traditional network of banks, rather than dealing with currency conversions and jumping in and out of USD.


I never said a person is in "full control." Frankly, just the opposite is true... most people don't want full control. They want an FDIC insured bank account that they can't screw up too badly.

[66 countries actively covered]( (which satisfies the majority of Americans anyway).
The recipient doesn't need a PayPal account when you send payment. And he doesn't need to bank at USAA to get the funds immediately. He'll get an email explaining that he needs to set a PayPal account up, however, in order to claim the funds.
If you send the money to the wrong email or phone number, you can reclaim it... unless it's been cashed out. But then, non-reversible payments are a drawback inherent in bitcoin too.
Anyway, this turned into a USAA post, which certainly wasn't my intent. But their mobile payments do address a lot of the issues you're bringing up.

This is one single daily-deals site. It's like Woot.com accepting bitcoin, and your conclusion is that therefore, most Americans use bitcoin. Which is wrong.


No, if you're "unbanked" you cannot use an exchange efficiently. For every $0.50 a person manages to save, he needs to create a money order, send it to an exchange, wait for several days or weeks, buy bitcoin, and then go through the reverse process every single time they want cash. Which is all the time, because if you live a day's walk from the nearest city, you want to buy food and medical supplies today. And you can't do that right now with bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn't even a bad solution at the moment for these people. It's no solution at all.
I hope that changes - and in fact this is what attracted me to bitcoin in the first place. I'm optimistic for the future, but as someone who is directly involved in a non-profit for the unbanked, I cannot and will not recommend bitcoin today for those who are most vulnerable.

It is worthwhile to note, however, that criminal prosecutions of banking executives are virtually non-existent... regardless of the offense, and despite emails sent between executives. Written evidence was collected regarding mortgage / securities fraud - just as it was against HSBC regarding terrorism funding - which went nowhere. Sherry Hunt is still out there waiting for prosecutions, even though she has a cabinet full of documents that no one is willing to seriously review.

No. Like I said, it's societal. 
You're pointing the finger at someone and saying "it's your fault for being poor," while completely ignoring all of the societal factors that keep him in poverty. Kids born to parents with serious addiction problems, who live jam-packed into filthy tenement houses. There is no "white" scale equivalent because when you go into any inner-city urban environment in America - it's disproportionately populated by minorities. This is how American society has been structured in the past... and although racism is getting better... it's still the way society is structured today.

Bitcoin is risky. If you think doge isn't, you're a bigger idiot than I already think you are.


Wow - tipbots. What a solid example of how doge offers tangible benefits over bitcoin.


Bitcoin's confirmation times are longer, true. And this isn't going to change. What will change is services that bridge the gap - and these are being actively developed as we speak. 
This certainly isn't enough to justify doge overtaking bitcoin in the future. Bitcoin literally has orders of magnitude advantage in the innovation / infrastructure space.
Moreover, the creators of dogecoin itself "hope that it will be remembered as 'the fun cryptocurrency' and that it can be used for small purchases like video games or toys." Unlike you, they readily acknowledge it isn't a serious contender.

She didn't.


She didn't.
Look, they were her words. Her job is to write a story and hand it over to her editor for review. Who then gives it the green light or hands it back and demands revisions / corrections. So the final product is the outcome of several different people. Just as the reporter does not determine article placement - she didn't choose that her article would be on the cover. That was also an editorial decision.

Sure. Capital gains taxes are for people who have enough income to invest. We're talking about upper middle class and above.
So if we offer lower tax rates for the wealthy, effectively we're arguing that trickle down economics is a viable model. Cut taxes for the rich, and society benefits as a result. Which we know is complete fallacy.
Income taxes should be lowered, and capital gains taxes increased to make up the difference. Society would be much better off under this model than under the current system.

Yes... and in fact I've been pushing to get bitcoin accepted for donations for several months now... but it simply isn't happening. At least not in the immediate future. Which is - from my point of view - rather tragic.
Rather than grandstanding about how inferior bitcoin is for donations - which isn't my view at all - I'm simply trying to explain why some charities may not accept donations.
Loosely, it's like any other job with non-compete clauses. If you consult for Microsoft, and your firm gets an opportunity to also consult with Apple, there are a lot of politics involved. So even if you build strict internal firewalls and assign completely different teams to each account, I can understand why Microsoft would get pissed if you signed Apple without their express permission.
Keeping a core of primary donors happy is in some ways similar. You don't risk upsetting the people who butter your bread regularly, by accepting donations which go against their "interests," whatever those are.
It's politics. And it sucks. But there's the reality.

People carried around checkbooks through the 80s and 90s. Which are just as convenient as credit cards, and have zero fees. And still, merchants did not offer lower prices. So it's pretty clear convenience isn't the limiting factor here.


Historically merchants have not incentivized customers by refusing credit cards. Why should it change now?
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:50:36


You have this exactly backwards. Consumer demand *should* drive merchant adoption. But it isn't. Merchants are adopting bitcoin and hoping that consumers will use it.

Admittedly, I have not read the book. But it's pretty easy to guess why a savvy executive would publicly outline his "titanic screwups" in such a blatant and self-defeating manner. To skirt criminal charges. It's difficult to prosecute an idiot... even though we already know HSBC executives are most certainly intelligent people.
This entire discussion is analogous to you advocating a book by Dick Cheney (and his lawyers) on why Guantanamo torture should be considered legal and acceptable.
And... based on your synopsis, you are trying to compare a small bank that specialized in foreign accounts with HSBC, an international giant which was repeatedly warned against financing organizations directly tied to Al Qaeda - and was given specific names of these organizations. We have an executive paper trail, pushing the envelope of re-engagement even after being formally cited dozens of times.

3% isn't enough to put up with the hassle of gift cards. Because let's face it - they are a pain in the ass.
If I spend $100, I get a $3 "incentive." And unless I can find something that costs exactly $103, I end up with a few dollars in change, left on a gift card that I'll probably never use again. Which negates the perk to begin with.
And this is after you go to the hassle of acquiring bitcoins, using them on Gyft, purchasing a gift card, turning around and using that gift card to buy what you actually wanted in the first place.

Not clueless. Just realistic.
Bitcoin wasn't made to make investors rich. And I agree that the purpose is much deeper. But like it or not, investors are entering the game. And they don't care about pie-in-the-sky ideals. They want to put their money into a system that has the potential to increase their returns.
I'm sure there are some people here who are die-hard bitcoin fanatics, and are solely interested in seeing the technology succeed. But even these people will sell out if the price gets high enough.
You can break down human motivation into a select few buckets. Money is one of them. People pursue their ideals only when they're not worrying about the bills.
There are very, very few Edward Snowden's of the world, who are willing to make great sacrifices at incredible cost to themselves. Most of us are interested in playing video games and eating pizza, and fruitlessly complaining anonymously online.

Then you have two choices: 1) buy a smartphone and control your private keys (this option isn't affordable for most of the people you're talking about), or 2) use a dumb phone and pay a service to store your bitcoins. Which has few if any advantages over the current model.


People need a place to live. They also need money. But they do not need bitcoins.


Because I want bitcoin to become widely adopted. But the way things are progressing, its future is highly uncertain. If someone asks "Why should I care about it? Why should I bother with currency conversion at all?" there is no concise answer. There is no "killer app." 
Sure, advocates hope it will come... but there is no guarantee bitcoin will be used for much beyond online gambling and tax evasion (which are actually two good examples of where bitcoin has clear benefits).

Limiting exposure is very different than saying "its a valid point to not give out info, ever."
But since we're now on the topic of limiting exposure, your exposure is already limited simply by using debit cards. Someone steals your card info and makes fraudulent charges? You call your bank (or VISA, MC, AmEx, etc) and they literally give it back.
Limiting exposure makes sense for merchants, because they feel the brunt of fraudulent charges. Consumers don't. And since we're commenting in a thread about donations and not merchant accounts... all of these concerns basically amount to zilch.

And it's not just the job either. It's who is most successful within those jobs.
You can start out as a local politician really trying to improve your community. If you're motivated to become a mayor you need to sell out some of your personal goals to attract the right backers, so you can win the election. By the time you get to senator or congressman, it's much more about politics - and the relationships you bridge by negotiating deals - than it is about representing your community. The higher you go, the stiffer the competition, and the more back-room schmoozing and working with lobbyists comes into play.
By the time you reach national level politics, there are no innocents left.

The problem with his reasoning, is that seized cars and properties are also valuable assets. And you can go to an auction and get a slightly used Camaro for 50% under Blue Book. Or you can get the same Camaro for slightly under market value. It depends entirely on the auction, and where and when it's held.
So ultimately, with something like bitcoins, it can easily go either way. You cannot simply conclude that bitcoins will sell at (or even near) market value.

It's still up to gamblers to verify. Which happens how frequently? One out of 10,000 bets? 100,000? Maybe a million?
And since software can be programmed to do anything in the virtual world - given enough time and expertise - a casino could make 1 out of 3 bets 'provably fair,' if they decided to effectively weight the dice in their favor. Or one out of five. Or whatever the hell ratio they want, and just play the odds they don't get caught. After all - what's the worst that can happen... they need to admit an 'error in code' and give your money back?
So would I inherently trust a casino's odds to be fair just because it says 'provably fair' on their marketing collateral? Fuck no. Anyone that does is an idiot.

His point is that you cannot withdraw large sums of money from one single branch without prior notice, because the bank must ensure it has enough cash on hand to meet its normal business operations.

No one needs paper unless they want to build a fire, and I'm not arguing that point. Of course people need the things money can buy. You don't need to spell it out - my 3 year old knows it. And as you've already said, I'm not an idiot.


I would bet my understanding of bitcoin is no worse than yours. I just happen to think you're wearing rose colored spectacles. 
You've justified why bitcoin has no killer app yet, only that it might be developed. But you don't know what it might be, or what timetable we're operating on.
I've been around enough to see very promising technology crumble to dust. I was involved with Terabeam at the turn of the millennium... and we had a hub in our office. You've probably never heard of Terabeam. Their business model was to beam Internet connectivity between skyscrapers via laser. It was really fucking fast at the time too... and if it ever caught on, cities wouldn't need to spend millions of dollars digging up the streets to install fiber optic cable. And the military was using Terabeam to transmit information via direct line-of-sight, from a ground hub to military jets mid-flight, with 100% security since any interference in the beam and the entire information stream dissolved. This was in the year 2000.
Terabeam even recruited Dan Hesse as their CEO, who was the former head of AT&amp;T Wireless. A rock star in wireless tech. The company had everything - amazing tech, senior level talent... and went belly up anyway.
This shit happens a lot more often than you think it does. And before you point out bitcoin isn't a company... yes, I know. But entire technologies - like solar - can, and frequently do, get stalled for decades or more.
And if bitcoin fades into obscurity for 50 years until another crypto spurs renewed interest, I certainly wouldn't be shocked.

Even then it doesn't make any sense. 
Say someone steals your ID and uses their own biometric scan. Since there is no database, they get away with it. There is no reason to stop them - at the time of transaction - for providing non-referencable data.
Later on, when the money is withdrawn from your bank, you call up Robocoin and ask them what the hell they're billing you for. You've never been to a Robocoin ATM and you've never even heard of them. What do they say... sorry your money has been apparently stolen and now - even though you've never used one of our machines - you need to provide us with a biometric scan to get it back?
Fuck no. It's pointless all the way around. The only thing it can be used for is collecting data that a lot of people would have serious reservations about providing.

If you want to support Wikipedia, you must work within the confines of their existing payment network. Asking them to support bitcoin is fine. But withholding donations because they don't want to implement a new protocol is ridiculous.
Even for-profit sites that sell direct to consumers, like TigerDirect and Overstock, made substantial profits the first day they accepted bitcoin. Then bitcoin sales plummeted 90% on day 2.
It's perfectly understandable if a non-profit looks at this and thinks: it's not worth the dedicated resources we would need to implement this new feature.
And just because a board member doesn't want to accept bitcoin, doesn't make the entire project invalid.

Where Western Union has tremendous advantage is in their brick-and-mortar storefront presence. They have outlets in the majority of countries - including more rural communities - across the planet. Which is nice if you want to get your hands on some cash.
But this costs. A lot. Which is why their fees are exorbitant.
I really hope people transition to e-currency rather than feeling the need for physical cash. But - as you point out - that takes a significant shift in mindset. And for people who don't have much money, there is comfort in walking out of a branch with physical money in their pockets.

The primary reason, is that most consumers don't care about bitcoin. And why should they.
If consumer interest was high and business acceptance was the primary hurdle, it would be a much more favorable outlook. Because consumer demand would ultimately drive business adoption. Which is what we saw in 2013.

This is where you fall off the path entirely. Journalists - especially investigative journalists - are absolutely essential to a healthy democracy. Someone with NYT credentials can dig into a story, question people and expose wrongdoings that no one else can. Certainly not 3rd tier bloggers.

This forum is full of people who have no idea what Buffet said or why he said it.
He says bitcoin is simply a new, more efficient way of transmitting money. He's not discounting the usefulness of it... just that it doesn't necessarily make a sound investment. So he chooses to stay away and advises others to do the same.
And there is nothing at all wrong with that.

You need to realize that companies will not risk spending a fortune in equipment overhauls for access to a very small percentage of the market. Coinstar could pursue this line of thought further if bitcoin becomes more widely adopted. But right now? Spending money to be "first mover" in an area that they don't even focus on, makes precious little business sense.

There are none. For you, or me or anyone else. Anything you do, to lull yourself into some belief that you're undermining the people who implement these systems, is completely fruitless. Words can be powerful tools. But they cannot - and will not - dislodge insane leaders. You need force to do that.
You haven't cited any specific, non-violent actions that would result in complete overhaul of the system, because from my point of view they simply don't exist. 
These people don't play. And they don't relinquish control. I'm sure at some point in the (hopefully distant) future, the average American's life will be plagued with lack of food, or freedom will be so restricted people literally erupt, demanding change.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm not "opposed to Gyft." I just think their discount is paltry, and largely irrelevant.
It becomes more worthwhile the more you spend, but when you get into the $5000+ range, I could negotiate a better-than-3% discount myself by calling their customer support line.
As I mentioned in another note, Coinstar offers gift cards for your loose change. But they provide ~10% discount. This is what Gyft needs to aim for, to make it worthwhile for the end-user.

You're arguing it's "hard" to start a business when you cannot possibly fail. Sure, the business might go belly-up, but you have an economic safety net that will always, repeatedly break your fall and ensure the worst thing that can happen to you is a bruised ego.
Now imagine if you had no safety net, and your venture requires everything you own plus a sizable loan. If you go bust... your family ends up bankrupt, your credit is destroyed, and you get to work two full time jobs at the same time in order to keep your house.

Historically that has been true... but it isn't my point. You accepted credit cards because it was profitable to do so. You could have told Mastercard and Visa to go fuck themselves, and that you would only take cash from customers, while passing savings back to those customers. Which - theoretically - would give you a competitive advantage over other merchants which *did* accept credit cards and charged more for the service.
But that's not what happened. And why? Because it was a lot more profitable for you to tap into the credit market than it was to offer customer discounts on your already-thin profit margin.
Since this is already proven for cash, I have no idea why people think it won't also be true with bitcoin.

You have no evidence to support this claim. Why? Because there is no Libertarian nation in existence, and there never has been. And for good reason. So you have nothing to compare a living breathing system with, other than "here's a theory."
The underlying assumption stands - if a government does not support the poor, then who will? The Libertarian argument is "rich donors." Which is fallacy, and takes us right back to trickle down economics.


Do you know what the hell you're talking about? The number of impoverished people in India is staggering, and has increased right along with their population. The government is working to remove the caste system - with limited success more on paper than in reality - so there are no longer "untouchables" born and confined to poverty over the course of their entire lives. But that has more to do with social policy than anything related to the "free market" - which doesn't exist in India in the first place.

Let's see. Current value is - let's say - $750 USD per bitcoin.
6000% value increase, would mean each bitcoin is worth $45,000.
The Winklevii put an ultimate value around ~$40K, if memory serves, but they don't expect it within 1 year. And they are admittedly more than a little biased on this subject.
I'm optimistic for bitcoin's future. But this kind of increase in 1 year? I seriously doubt it. We need a whole hell of a lot of infrastructure built up and established around the bitcoin ecosystem before this becomes possible.
Perhaps 5 years out. Maybe.

What you're talking about are revolutionary inventions. Which are very, very uncommon. So uncommon, in fact, you probably can't name 8 other countries on the face of the planet that qualify as "innovative" today.
Which is a huge mistake. Technological advances build on prior inventions. Billboards were the precursor to the internet. Smartphones are an extension of cell phones, which were initially virtually useless aside from their novelty factor.
The engineers that refine and improve existing technology are every bit as important - and innovative - as those which develop niche, expensive, one-off products that they hope will one day become useful.

Ask any VC or investor (like Bruce Fenton for example) - who is very heavily invested - and he'll say you're a fool for taking this stance. Investing in any crypto at this stage is highly risky. In fact he posted something earlier today, saying whatever you put in, don't be shocked if you literally lose every single penny.


They promote synergistic relationships, sure... but that's as far as they go, even today. They do not promote the idea that doge will supplant bitcoin.
Look, I'm not going to change your mind. And you aren't going to change mine. Unless you can come up with a compelling reason that doge offers to justify orders of magnitude leaps to overtake bitcoin.
Everything you've mentioned, bitcoin can adapt to. Which - given that bitcoin has millions of dollars head-start in terms of market cap and venture funding within the ecosystem - is much, much more likely than doge ever catching up. And as more time passes and 3rd parties develop work-arounds, your points are going to become completely irrelevant altogether.

I don't understand this point of view at all. Minimum wage is cornerstone to a thriving economy - which has been cited again and again by independent economic analysts.
The problem is that companies which don't provide minimum wage, literally force employees into poverty.

You're simply transferring it from companies, to those people who are most vulnerable in society.

Unless you don't own credit/debit cards, there isn't a compelling argument to withhold your donation. Security is a joke - not because these concerns don't exist, but because they don't exist for consumers. Merchants bear the full brunt of security breeches.

Donating is up to you. But citing significant concerns around using debit/credit is disingenuous. And yes - in essence you are saying "fuck your cause if you don't support mine." But I can whitewash this phrase and come up with some alternate flowery language if it'll make you feel any better.

Only because you're an idiot that can't possibly believe that bitcoin has very real drawbacks - especially for marginalized people living on $1 USD or less per day. To you, when bitcoin's price tanks, you don't get to buy a new Xbox game. To the people I work with, they literally die.

I view selling out your ideals to the highest bidder in much the same way. Selling your body, or selling your soul... you're a whore either way.
It's understandable when people do these things out of necessity to survive. But people who do these things when they have other options? I really don't understand them at all.
So when I talk with someone who did this type of 'modeling' and she admits she was a stage whore living out of low-income housing until she saved up enough to get-the-hell-out, I really can understand her position.

89% of Americans support this model (either by leaning Democrat or Republican). And since we're talking about millions of people here, let's assume 50% of them are above average intelligence. So 44% of Americans fall in this category.

You're all over the map. Try to pick a point and stick to it... and to maintain some semblance of accuracy while you're at it.


This has nothing to do with anything we're discussing. Why even include it?


It's societal. We're talking about kids who grow up in projects that span 6 city blocks or more, and who all know multiple close family members and friends that were killed by inner-city violence or arrested. Try prioritizing education in an environment like that - where you don't know how you're going to eat unless you either 1. quit school to help your mother buy groceries or 2. sell blow on the corner... and suddenly you wouldn't do so well yourself.
In terms of funding, you're talking purely federal funds because the local tax base is abysmally poor, and parents cannot afford to pay into the school system as they do in the richer suburbs. So of course inner city schools get more federal funding. Which doesn't change some basic facts: there often aren't enough desks for students, books are outdated by years or decades, many of these schools don't even have computers or people who can fix / maintain them - or if they do - the computers are outdated to the point where they're useless beyond being a paperweight.
Your entire post screams privilege. Privilege at being able to criticize a system that you yourself have never once experienced. Privilege at criticizing the people who are unable to escape from poverty - and specifically those who are "African American" as you so eloquently point out.

How in the world can you reference biometrics that aren't on file anywhere? I could steal someone's ID and go to the ATM and use my own hand - and you'd have no idea who I am or if I'm the person linked back to the ID. 
^(~~So you'd have to push the transaction through anyway... unless you forced me to wait for some further verification, which you'd have to do to everyone, so the process becomes prohibitively cumbersome for real customers.~~)
^(~~In fact, in cases of fraud, once the real person contested the transaction and proved it wasn't his biometric which was scanned, you couldn't track down the imposter because of the lack of available databases.~~)
^(~~You'd only potentially catch the complete idiots that used their real ID, their real hand print, and then tried to defraud you by contesting that their biometrics weren't their own. And that's only if - after they contested it - you forced them to undergo another biometric print for comparison.~~)
^(~~So what's the point? It's a cumbersome process which thieves can easily get around... and you still have no way to catch them.~~)

Retailers offer huge discounts to try and effect the most basic of customer behavior changes. 10% off to get customers to turn left, rather than right, into the parking lot of a new grocery store for example.
It's widely recognized that any significant behavior change - like converting currency for example - simply will not happen on any measurable level for &lt; 20% discount. It's a pain in the ass, and consumers actively resist the hassle.

One concern for charities, is where the money comes from. You might think that they'll take any donation under the sun, but that's not always the case.
Ex: a women's rights group may decline a donation from a porn mogul. Whereas the porn mogul wants to publicize the donation, to show in some capacity he's pro-women's rights.
It's murky territory. A lot of charities want to draw very specific lines between amounts received and who sent the funds. And bitcoin's reputation is that it's an "anonymous" way to send money (or at least, more so than writing a check).

2. You're supposed to pay full taxes in bitcoin too. The rate is identical whether you get a check or a bitcoin transfer.
3. So work it out. And if you can't, you get paid anyway. Just in cash. Stop bitching about it - this really isn't the problem you make it out to be.

Stupidity for some, desperation for others. If you have no hopes of getting ahead, the lottery is your only one-in-a-million shot. And some people take that chance.
Your assumption that the "fuck em" attitude is libertarian is terribly off-base. If people want to spend their own money on lottery tickets, it isn't the lottery's fault for existing. Just as, it isn't a liquor store's fault for alcoholism.
Payday loans - on the other hand - are another matter entirely. They prey upon people's desperation in order to maximize profits. If you have to take out a paycheck loan in order to afford your kid's medication, it shouldn't be legal for the lender to charge exorbitant interest rates.

The reason why endorsing inner city children works, is because they have a future to look forward to. Without someone saying "I'll pay your college fees," these kids **know** they can't break out of the cycle of poverty. And parents understand this: they push their kids to do well in school. It's a shot for something better in life, and adults realize just how valuable this is.
If you approach a classroom, parents will hear "I'm setting aside $0.50 for your child and investing in internet money, but in 15 years it might be worth a whole lot!" At which point the entire cycle literally crumbles to dust. Try to convince people $0.50 is going to be worth a lot of money... and you'll get ridiculed. And they might be right, who knows.

Because buying a gift card, to then turn around and buy something online, is a pain in the ass. And you must use the full amount, or you end up with a card with an odd amount of change on it - which is largely useless.
You only save $3 for every $100 you spend. If Gyft offered a more substantial discount, it might actually be worthwhile. 
But 3%? I'll pay that, just so I don't have to deal with gift cards at all.

This is precisely why small, marginalized businesses (like selling skins out of a gas station parking lot) consider bitcoin. It's a last ditch effort to make some profit with little downside.

There isn't a lender in the world - short of predatory lenders - who will give these people money. How does that magically change under your system.


Except social inequity in this country keeps people perpetually in "hard times." So you need a way to give poor people enough food to eat and supplies to manage, for years at a time... or you end up with dead bodies lining the streets.

@_date: 2015-01-17 04:03:04


What you have failed to say is how much you've actually invested. The only firm number you gave is $10k, which is entirely misleading.


No it is not. The average American makes just under $30k a year. And it is - quite literally - impossible to get to $6 million in 20 years. Which you would know if you were indeed "fiscally adept."
I'm no rocket scientist, but apparently I know a whole lot more about investing than you do. But let's look at some solid numbers right now, so we can get any points of confusion out of the way.
Say you invest $10k *per year* and assume a 4% growth rate, which you continually reinvest. Note: 4% is lower than the S&amp;P average, but higher than S&amp;P between years 2000 - 2010. So you'd have:
| Year | Amount Saved   |
| 1        | $10,000 |    
| 2  |  $20,400 |  
| 3    |   $31,216 |  
| 4 | $42,464.64 |
|5 | $54,163.23 |
|6 | $66,329.75 |
|7 | $78,982.94 |
|8 | $92,142.26 |
|9 | $105,828 |
|10 | $120,061.10 |
And so on. By the end of the 20th year, you almost have $300,000. Which is $100,000 more than if you didn't continually reinvest... and that is a lot of money.
But it is nowhere even remotely close to $6 million. Hell, it isn't even close to $1 million. So while your investment strategy overall is sound, the amount you think you can make is orders of magnitude higher than anything even remotely realistic.

It takes a certain level of narcissism to do this. Which means - unless they are entirely hypocritical - that someone else who is trying to do something similar in a non-competitive way... well, they get a free pass.

Every libertarian I've talked to has always skirted the question: "What is life like for poor people?" Because we both know the answer to that.

@_date: 2015-01-26 23:56:50
First of all, you need to understand that the majority of poor people live in inner city shit holes. There is no communing with nature, no log cabins, no outhouses. Many of these people have never even seen a farm and have no idea what an eagle looks like outside of magazine pictures.
It's a concrete jungle with nowhere to go, aside from low income housing high rises. And that won't change... even under your mythical system. Because society is structured to keep poor minorities poor and confined. This has nothing to do with the free market. It's institutionalized racism mixed with class-ism. So you either use the run-down towers that people currently live in, or you build an expensive new one. Which isn't happening now, even though the wealthiest Americans are better off than ever before in living history. 
If your version of trickle down theory worked - where wealth diffused from the rich to the poor through donations and such - society would be improving as the wealthy get wealthier. But yeah... that ain't happening. In fact, wealth disparity is getting worse.


Meaning infants will starve to death.


Inner city kids don't have a chance to become accountants. Even if you graduate from high school, even if you can get a scholarship to community college... how are you going to prioritize studying when your mother is a junkie and your little brother needs your help. And how are you going to spend time reading books when your family needs financial support.
College is not unattainable because poor people are lazy. It is unattainable because life in the inner city does not allow it to even be a consideration.
But all of this is ancillary. The point is - your "voluntaryist" society is predicated on the same theory as Reaganomics. Wealth will diffuse from the rich to the poor. Which is nothing more than a steaming pile of horse turds.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:37:12
The truly hilarious thing about his comment, is that every libertarian I've ever met actively skirts the question: "what is life like for poor people in a society without regulation and social safety programs?"

I really wish people would stop citing security as a bitcoin selling point. Bitcoin has many advantages, but security simply isn't one of them yet.
Fraudulent charges on your credit or debit card are easily reversed. Banks literally give you your money back, and then try to track down the thieves. You don't need to worry about a thing, once you initiate a fraudulent claim charge.
Bitcoin - on the other hand... well, once it's gone you're shit out of luck. Nothing short of a miracle is bringing your coins back.
Focus on transmission of wealth across borders. Or the advantages of deflationary currency. Or a dozen other advantages bitcoin really does offer. But security? Shit, if people keep citing this, it's going to destroy what little credibility we've managed to establish.

Which - even if true - says nothing whatsoever about what happens when all government funding ceases. As in other societies with zero social welfare programs - which we have plenty of evidence to support - people starve to death en masse.


Trickle down economics does not work. Period. And any personal experience you may have is well refuted by reams of documents discrediting this theory in its entirety. But it's nice to know that your "ideal" society revolves entirely around people being nice. Because like it or not - poor people make up the largest segment.


This is a libertarian site.
And no, your academic papers do not address any of these items. They only address tangentially related debate on economics. So in essence you haven't provided anything other than links to libertarian sites and personal examples of people "being nice." And this is what you base your ideal society on.
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:35:28
No... I just know the math.
The 40% returns I mentioned earlier wasn't a guess. You would literally need 40% returns - continually reinvested - year over year, for 20 years in order to earn slightly under $6 million. And then you'd lose 15% of that to taxes.
Do you know impossible it is to do what you are suggesting? I could let you pick 20 different investments for just 2015, and statistically you wouldn't even be able to pick one which yields a 40% return.
And you are telling me that not only did you do it, but you did it year after year, 20 times in a row. And through a "balanced portfolio" to boot.
This is why your claims are bullshit. It is mathematically impossible without 1) either having a LOT more money to invest over time, or 2) gambling on one-in-a-million long shots.

The stat includes any toxic exposure (of which food poisoning is a very small percent). And where food poisoning is involved, it's because someone at a restaurant or food processing facility royally fucked up.

In my state you have to pay for a Bachelors and then 2 year certificate and then promise to pay for a Masters within 5 years of graduation... all so you can start at $30k and work your up to $40k after 2 decades.
So no, teachers are not valued in any sense of the word. The reality is... I made more money, had greater perks, and worked fewer hours fetching coffee in an office than I ever did as a teacher.

This is such a load of horseshit I don't even know where to begin. 
Discrimination fundamentally revolves around a belief of superiority. I am inherently better than you, because my skin color is different. Which means that I get better service, have access to better jobs, my children are superior to your children and get to attend better schools, I get access to higher quality food and water, etc, etc, etc.

Precisely. The last time we let business decide that open racism was tolerable, it resulted in slavery. Merchants made a shit ton of profits by imprisoning people and shackling them with chains. Which all began with laws empowering them to do so... based on the belief that minority lives weren't worth as much. Society bought into this because the vocal opponents were quickly shut out by business owners who were raking in profits.
Once racism becomes pervasive, you end up with slavery and a whole host of horrendous problems that you just gloss over as somehow "normal."

Discrimination is based on a fundamental belief that I am inherently better than you. You aren't welcome in my business. I get better access to higher quality education and resources.
This is why African Americans still make up a disproportionate percentage of inner city communities *even today.* They are forced into a cycle of poverty which is virtually impossible to break out of, because historically they had no access to the same resources that whites did.
All of this - all of it - begins with the belief that "I am simply better than you." Which is why acting on that belief by refusing service is absolutely illegal... just as it should be.

The only way this is feasible for the 45.3 million people in the US who fall below the poverty line, is for the government to provide it either directly or indirectly. Which is what happens today, although the system is far from perfect. 
Today you can walk down any street in America and not see starving corpses. Take away all social safety nets, and rely solely on the good will of wealthy individuals, and find out how quickly that changes.

I recommend you watch the whole thing, as this is a really fascinating documentary. But I've time queued the video to an analogy by one of the most prominent minds in HFT.
In a nutshell, HFT traders insert a small snippet into their code, allowing the exchanges to recognize their orders and give preferential status. When an order executes, HFT insiders are immediately given priority status - they buy an order and resell it a picosecond later, for a tiny profit. Each transaction is miniscule... but the net effect is millions of dollars. And it's completely guaranteed. There is zero risk for them, because they only queue jump with orders that are already set to execute.
They exist solely to insert themselves as middlemen, buying an order and reselling it a fraction of a second later.

Also, the Compuserve mail system was implemented in 1989. People may not have been singing up for Compuserve en masse... but it was pretty clear to anyone in the industry that email had inherent advantages over slower forms of communication.
The problem with bitcoin isn't that it offers no advantages to anyone. It does - especially in the remittance market. Where it falls short, however, is mass consumer appeal.

If you live in an inner-city tenement slum, you have to walk over broken syringe vials and duct tape holes in your apartment walls because you have no other options. People string electrical cables between units, because entire families cannot afford basic utilities.

People like you who think you can relate to what "poor" means have no true concept of the word. Poverty is inescapable for virtually everyone trapped by it.

So when it hits $10,000 USD, you'll have a tidy profit of $1.50.
I hope you're planning to spend it and get something useful!

The bottom line is that when there is a discount, someone is sacrificing profits. The only reason to do so for a retailer, is if he can make up those lost profits at some point.

People want to buy bitcoins, and are willing to pay - at the moment - over $200 apiece. A few months ago you could buy a bitcoin for $30 apiece. Go back a few years, they were priced under $1.

Is this based on societal bias? Sure. But few - if any - societies value prostitutes, so this bias is a very real and tangible thing.
No one wants to be a whore when they grow up. And certainly no one wants their daughter to aspire to become a prostitute. It's a career based on no options and the need for money. If your daughter said "daddy, I want to be a whore," I'm sure you wouldn't encourage it. Because it's dangerous. Because she can do better. Because a thousand reasons.
Like I said... you do what you gotta do to survive. But being proud of it is fiction that only exists in these nameless, faceless forums - primarily to increase pageviews - and not in the real world.

The problem is there isn't any reason to offer price discounts. Theoretically bitcoin eliminates merchant credit card fees. But current bitcoin exchange fees and the hassle of learning about bitcoin - and setting up a wallet - completely negates the benefits.
Basically a merchant is faced with the decision: will you go to the hassle of learning about a new payment system, update your Web site, accept a highly volatile currency and after all that, lose money through discounts because of exchange fees?
It'll get better over time, but this is not exactly a selling point in today's environment.

Mainly I'm here because I do PR for tech companies. Which doesn't mean I'm good at tech. It means I can write moderately well when I want to, and I know how to communicate with reporters. But any trained monkey could do it.
This is why I think people who have made a lot of money could figure out how to invest in bitcoin pretty easily.

You're hilarious. Applying a programming schema to validate whether prostitution is an honorable career choice.
This is entirely about how society perceives prostitutes... and the disadvantages of the job. We haven't even touched on the sex trade and how a significant portion of hookers work for pimps - who take a cut of the profits through force. You don't pay, you get assaulted. You're on staff, you get raped. You complain, you get beaten. You try to escape, you get handcuffed to the bed.
Or the children who are abducted from overseas into a life of sexual slavery - which happens from Berlin to Moscow to New York. Even in red light districts where this honorable profession of yours is perfectly legal.
And your daughter would be working and interacting with these women even if she herself wasn't one of them. Yet you continue to defend this as a valid career choice - and one that you would encourage her to pursue with the same vigor as becoming a sales person.
I'm not the one who is blind here. The sex trade has many, many disadvantages that you conveniently completely ignore... and - if you are honest with yourself (which doesn't seem to be one of your strong suits) - you wouldn't want your own family anywhere near this travesty.

They won't accept them without verification they're 'clean.' Compiling a database of clean coins would be technically pretty easy to do, with legislation that says if you accept bad coins, you're fucked. So what you need to do is use an integrated online verification service in tandem with your payment.


They'd probably start from baseline, meaning all coins are assumed 'clean' until a specific future date. After that, you have a choice to use coinvalidation or not. Validated coins could - unlike dirty coins - be accepted at Walmart, Best Buy and dozens of other major retailers. Even die-hard bitcoiners would rush to run the new protocol, because the value of clean coins using a centralized exchange would be 100x or 1000x the value of dirty coins, which aren't accepted by reputable international businesses. Which would - at the same time - send the value of dirty coins plummeting.
Sure, there will always be an exchange for dirty coins. But they'd be valued a fuck ton less. Just see how many people would uphold the 'open' nature of bitcoin when their profits are on the line. You'll have huge percentages of miners and everyone else just clamoring for it.
But it seems you have this all figured out, from your high-horse pedestal atop your porcelain shitter.

Right now nobody knows what is going to be invented. There are some interesting ideas... I think remittances are a huge opportunity. Go to a kiosk, hand the guy a $100 bill and instantly send it to your family in Kenya with almost zero fees (Western Union currently charges ~$40 for this service). Or when you go through a checkout line in a grocery store, skip the credit card scanner and tap your smartphone against a bitcoin reader (this appeals to merchants, who wouldn't have to pay Mastercard 3-5% for every single card swipe... accepting bitcoin is virtually free).

It would be nice if a major financial institution was actually working to integrate bitcoin payments into their international transfer division.

I pay attention to this sub religiously, and it has gone to shit lately. I agree with sje46.
The only thing that's better is the amount of phishing posts. The mods have done - overall - a good job removing them.
Memes and jokes detract from this forum because they have nothing of value to offer. Newcomers to bitcoin visit the front page - which is frequently full of cat pics (or their equivalent) - and then leave feeling like bitcoin is a complete joke of an investment, popular in 8th grade social circles.
The real question here isn't about "fascism" or "regulation." It's about quality content. Memes have as much value as posts begging for bitcoin, and I don't hear you complaining about fascist policies because those are removed.

No... you haven't established that small Viking communities were libertarian at all, aside from saying they were. We're talking about the entire goddamn country having less than 50,000 people at the time.

This is wrong. Big pharma (GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, etc) makes billions off proprietary drugs.

We could also relegate drug discovery to the nonprofit sector. But the bottom line is, private industry cannot be trusted to oversee affordable, quality healthcare... which I consider to be a basic right.

Your heart is in the right place... but marketing budgets for open source projects are - and will always be - peanuts compared to companies pushing proprietary technology.

Oh yes.
Most people agree that cryptocurrencies are here to stay... and that one will ultimately become the "standard."
Bitcoin has an advantage in that it's building the first solid platform - and is gaining adoption. But if the US or other governments decide to stifle its growth through strict regulation, it won't be nearly as useful to consumers... so they'll find something else which is practical to spend / accept payments, and supported by the gov't.
@_date: 2013-10-21 06:57:07


This certainly isn't guaranteed. I'm sure banks are watching with interest at this point, though.


I'm sure they will if they are ever seriously threatened. One possibility is making all transactions illegal that cannot be rescinded within a certain time frame, phrased as some "consumer protection" legislation. Since bitcoin's transactions are immediate and irreversible - at least without some form of intermediary escrow service - this would outlaw direct bitcoin transfers.

Phone payments are the next frontier, actually. Even in remote, impoverished countries phones are pervasive.
Interestingly, airtime minutes are already used as local currency in many African communities because local people don't have access to banks, let alone credit cards.


The biggest obstacle to bitcoin's adoption in these areas isn't necessarily that it's Web based. It's the wide price swings. When you can lose 20% value from one week to the next, people in the margins would literally starve. Once the price becomes more stable, this problem will vanish.

And they may not need to. There were lots of free, and practical MS Office alternatives even back into the 1990s. But Microsoft convinced the public that paying money for their product was worth it. It was quite an accomplishment on their behalf... and people still use MSFT as the standard today. There are other examples as well.
Utility and technology aren't the only factors to determine success... which was my point. If a company can convince people that their product is superior - even if it isn't - then it gets widely adopted.

There is a reason they were valued at $10 less than a year ago. Sure, companies like Coinbase have built out the infrastructure - which has definite value - so I doubt it'll ever go that low.

Something can be technologically superior and still fail. Linux is open source and there have been a shit-ton of free and very useful programs available.

If history teaches us anything, it's that whatever is marketed best, becomes widely adopted.
Bitcoin has a head start in terms of adoption, no arguments. But another crypto comes along - similar to Ripple - which has a shit ton of venture funding and is able to convince banks to adopt it over bitcoin for whatever reason, and it will become the new standard.
Even in this case I don't think bitcoin will disappear entirely. But it'll be used by a minority of people for niche purposes.

Well... it would be like the government issuing inferior alcohol, and then prohibiting all non-government alcohol.
There would still be a market for non-government alcohol, but a lot of people would stay above board because there is a legal alternative - even if it is inferior. So it becomes a lot like the speeding example.

It seems like this isn't bitcoin's strong point. You're effectively paying 5% on top of Amazon's markup.
Bitcoin's potential revolves around retailers that no longer need to worry about chargebacks. They will be able to sell products for less than they normally would using traditional currency. Not more.

Coca Cola's distribution channels are phenomenal - and they have THE model for anyone studying product distribution.
You can go to a dirt-poor village in buttfuck Sudan, a week's walk from any major city, where people don't have a hospital, cars or electricity, and there is invariably some guy selling Coca Cola.

Not true. A proprietary coin could even supplant bitcoin.
Microsoft in the 1990s convinced the world that their MS Office technology was better than open source programs. Which it wasn't - but they spun up such a successful marketing campaign that people willingly paid hard earned money for an inferior product, when they could have gotten a superior product for absolutely free.
Bitcoin's future is far from guaranteed. In fact if history teaches us anything, it's that open source projects can start out ahead, but quickly succumb to well-funded proprietary competition... companies that can basically dump millions into marketing and PR.
5 years from now, I will be shocked if bitcoin has no major competitors. And in fact it might be runner-up or worse.

I disagree entirely with almost every single sentence you wrote.


Poverty means you cannot afford even basic goods and services. This never changes. It's not a subjective word.


OK, time for a reality check. People - for the most part - do not care about "giving." And if they do, oftentimes it's because they get a tax break. On the flip side, you imply there are numbers of people who **want** to live in poverty... which is so fucked up I have no idea what you're thinking. There may be 1 out of 100,000 who is mentally ill, or a religious fanatic, but this number is so small we can count it as zero.
There are one billion people who live on this planet, who have no electricity, no access to fresh water or hospitals. And there are fewer, and richer multi-billionaires than at any point through history. The rich tend to stockpile wealth and - once they have so much they cannot possibly spend it all - then they tend to think about ways to donate. It's an afterthought.
Which means greed trumps giving. And it will continue to do so for as long as we're both alive and well beyond that. It's been this way since the dawn of humanity and it isn't going to change. People kill for money. People die for money. Greed is a human quality that is inherent in all of us.


Your standard of living might be rising. But for most - even in America - it's doing exactly the opposite.

Ripple is interesting actually... although this forum tends to hate on it quite a bit. They have some heavy hitters from Google Ventures and others backing them.
Basically it's a conversion and payment service which avoids all the banking fees associated with sending money. Say you want to pay me $50, and I live in Germany while you live in the US. You can debit your account $50 in USD, send it over the Ripple network instantly (which converts your $50 to XRP - Ripple currency). Then it's converted to Euros instantly on my end.

This is why the value - according to a lot of people - is more likely to go to zero than skyrocket to insane levels.
It's important to note that the likelihood of bitcoin becoming "scarce and sought after" may not be as likely as another crypto becoming the new standard and rendering bitcoin obsolete, or relegated to niche markets. 
Your underlying assumption here is that bitcoin will spike in value regardless of whether it ultimately becomes the new standard or not. Which certainly isn't guaranteed.

To use a debit card, you enter your card number, expiration date and the 3 number code on the back. You also enter your billing address.
To use bitcoins, you need to provide **more** than this information just to the exchanges (or Coinbase). You need proof positive of who you are, your complete bank account information and more. 
Then - and I'll say this again - you need to wait for review/approvals, buy a gift card that you can then use to buy what you really want.
I love bitcoin as much as the next guy on this forum. But it isn't easy to use for your average person. That much is indisputable at this point in time.

So... you have an idea, and you want to get paid for it. Yes, this is possible, but honestly it's very, very unlikely you'll actually succeed. Why? Because you're trying to outsource the entire creation of your idea to different people.
If you hire quality people who are good at coding and design, you'll need to pay them adequately. Even for a relatively simple game, this is expensive. Then you'll need to market the game - or if you don't know how to market - you'll need to pay someone to do that too.
By the time you're done paying everyone, even if the game is moderately successful, you'll be lucky to break even. 
This is precisely why people who develop apps and indie games tend to be coders.

Despite all the hate that Ripple gets - and how everyone on this forum dismisses it - it does concern me as a competitor. 
From a gov't / regulatory standpoint, having one company in charge of issuing a new internet currency is very appealing. And the tech &amp; investor mindshare Ripple has attracted is, frankly, incredible.
People shout "look at Bitcoin's adoption curve! look at how many small / local businesses are adopting it! this morning, Joe's Truck Stop Cafe announced they are accepting bitcoin!"

OK, I agree with this (on the few limited products that are available).

The problem with this... is instability is a primary criticism why Bitcoins aren't "real money."

To be successful, we need seamless integration. That scanner at the WalMart that accepts MasterCard... use it for bitcoin payments by tapping your smart phone against it. Conversion is completely seamless and behind-the-scenes. As long as you have enough bitcoin in your account, the corresponding USD amount is debited, converted and sent to WalMart for well under the 3% merchant fee they pay VISA.
This is the holy grail. Once this system - or something like it - is implemented, vendors will flock to bitcoin.

Honestly, there aren't a lot of incentives. Yet. Remittances are a big one... but the ecosystem needs to evolve before small business owners jump on board in order to eliminate their credit card merchant fees.
As of now, in many cases it actually costs more to buy products using bitcoin. You need to buy a gift card which you can then use online for face value... which is a huge pain in the ass and a waste of time. And if bitcoin increases in value, the seller wins and the buyer loses. Or if bitcoin value plummets, the seller loses and the buyer wins.

The screaming for regulation is logical. China effectively neutered its exchange, and the value is tanking.
If the US and EU follow suit, the price will get destroyed and will not recover. Sure, there will always be an underground market for bitcoin, but transactions will be limited to face-to-face exchanges.

You're being disingenuous. Becoming a whore is much, much lower on the pole than a sales person - and you know it.


I never claimed otherwise. But it's still a career born from desperation, no matter how you want to spin it.
I could provide examples of how desperate people do desperate things - and how prostitutes are more prone to drug abuse, physical abuse and psychological abuse by the very nature of their profession. Which is exactly why people don't aspire to become whores. But the bottom line is, we live in society with spoken and unspoken rules. At least here in modern society (and every historical society I can think of as well) - being a prostitute is "less than" other professions.

Whoever is selling at the time you buy.
Since there are thousands of sellers, your money likely gets distributed to a large number of buyers. So you can't point to one single person and say "he has my cash."
When you go to sell, someone (or more likely, a group of people) will have bids to buy your bitcoins at the price you're asking... so long as it's market value. This is why you can check on the exchanges to see how much bitcoins are selling for.

So while this reporter thinks that handing over cash makes people think twice about spending - and he's right - there are apps that can be developed to mimic this for bitcoin.

In some ways, since the interface is completely customizable, I would think that people who are budget-conscious could find an app that's more psychologically influential than counting physical dollars.

Bitcoin is about as "free market" as anything else, with price manipulation, regulations around capital gains taxes, etc.

@_date: 2013-11-07 15:40:11


I don't agree. I think the way forward for bitcoin is to work within the existing regulatory framework and to adapt to new laws as they are created.


To an extent... but only within the confines of our own government and international law. The problem with looking at any form of capitalist economy and attributing the flow of goods and services to the free market is that regulations do exist. Without them, from my point of view, we'd be much worse off.
We need safety and environmental regulations, to name two specifics. Without them, businesses will continue on their path towards maximizing profits by doing things like dumping waste into lakes and streams. Why pay for proper disposal if you can dump it for free?
If Walmart teaches us anything, it's that consumers want to pay bottom dollar for products, regardless of business practices. The whole "responsible businesses will outcompete those that aren't" argument simply doesn't hold any water, as we've seen time and again.
For consumers, savings trump everything. Which is why regulating business practices is essential.

The problem is that buying gift cards with bitcoin **is** a pain in the ass. Typically you don't even save any more money than you would buying it with USD.
Until there is real incentive people won't use it in earnest. Ease-of-use is hindered by the hurdles you have to jump in order to get into the exchanges. Price is hindered by both lack of available merchants and no real deals for using bitcoin. Sure, you can save 10% on some sites. But you can typically find as-good or better deals using USD.
I think bitcoin has real potential... but for most people, the incentives just aren't strong enough. The ecosystem needs to mature further.

I'm not the only one with this "cognitive dissonance." The World Bank estimated in 2010 that 44 million people were pushed into poverty because of high food prices, and that speculation was one of the main causes.
Or [Yaneer Bar-Yam and Greg Lindsay of the New England Complex Systems Institute argue that mathematical models show that speculation — and not mere supply and demand — can explain real-world spikes in food prices.](
Or the [letter]( from 450 separate economists to the G20 finance ministry urging them that "excessive financial speculation is contributing to increasing volatility and record high food prices, exacerbating global hunger and poverty."
The only cognitive dissonance here is that - even if you don't outright agree that speculation fuels starvation and malnutrition - you don't care enough to look into concerns raised by people who are likely more prominent in your field than you are.

Your wallet is never linked to any personal information. The exchanges - and services like Coinbase - are required to collect your personal information by law, however.
You might find someone to meet locally and swap cash for bitcoins. This is about the only way to do it anonymously. Then, if you decide in the future to sell your bitcoins back for cash, you'll need to find physical buyers. No online service will serve as an exchange without covering their asses first.

Nope. They just need the full support of the banks - and by extension - the government. I don't think this would "kill" bitcoin, because there will be a market for it for the foreseeable future.

If you approach things as 'good' or 'bad' without room for improvement, you'll never be successful. People make progress by intentionally finding weaknesses and pushing on them until they break. And then picking up the pieces and making improvements.

It wouldn't be possible to outlaw them entirely. But it would be possible to stifle their widespread adoption.
We're talking about the difference between bitcoin as a specialty, niche currency and bitcoin as a widely used form of exchange. Which is the difference between bitcoin as the standard cryptocurrency vs. something else taking root and marginalizing bitcoin to the point it becomes worth very little.

Actually I'm not. Fundamental shifts in supply and demand do have very real-world implications for people, and I never claimed otherwise.
What frustrates me is when speculators refuse to recognize that there is a very real relationship between their behavior and how it impacts other people. Food speculators profiting off price increases is a fantastic example.
You talk to them about it, and either they recognize their behavior causes human suffering directly and they simply don't care - which is abhorrent but I tend to respect honesty... or they demand absolute proof (which they then argue vehemently against), all so that they can maintain an aura of innocence.
Playing in these markets for personal profit does have very real world impacts - especially for those trying to eek out a subsistence-based living.

Here's the thing though. Next week, bitcoin could be trading at $150 or $50. If it dives, people will shake their heads in moderate disbelief but they'll come to accept it. If the new "normal" becomes $150, that's what people will accept.
There is no fixed price - or even guidepost as to what bitcoins should be worth. And therefore there hasn't yet been a good argument pegging any sort of US dollar value to bitcoin. Because it simply doesn't exist. At this point, it's all pure speculation.

Because if a Web site has no plans for success - even in the short term - it is by definition a fly-by-night operation.
Other gambling sites might enable you to wager how much Bitcoin value will increase or decrease in a given period of time. They pay out to the closest bet while retaining a cut for themselves. That makes sense. Any amount they pay out is less than what they make.
But this Web site that you are linking to has no solid foundation. The owners will need to pay out - and pay out big - whenever the next major news announcement happens. And the time after that. And the time after that.
If we're going to be honest, this Web site - either by design or by complete oversight - isn't going to be here to pay out in coming months. And I tend to assume people aren't stupid. Which means they're collecting as much as they can before vanishing.

No, it's not. This is precisely why mobile minutes have become the medium of exchange in many of these African communities.
Hyperinflation might be a problem. But it's not nearly the problem you make it out to be. A much larger issue is that people living in rural communities have no access to banks, period.
I'm not "blind in [my] privilege." In fact I work with non-profits that are seeded in Ghana and other countries. And I'm telling you right now - until the exchange rate stabilizes, bitcoin is a bad move for people living on less than $1 a day.
How you can possibly argue otherwise is beyond me. Haven't you ever heard "don't invest more than you can afford to lose?" Well, your life is typically much more than you can afford to lose.

No it doesn't. Because your point is that businesses will continue to develop drugs that cost $100 million + in R&amp;D, and then essentially give their profits away to anyone who clones them.
That isn't a sustainable business model. We can debate until next Tuesday about the percentage of profits which pharma generates from patents... but the bottom line is they will not pour millions of dollars into something with zero profit return.

If you took 2 seconds to actually read through his response, he wasn't bragging about his credentials. He was using them to show there are legitimate reasons to question someone's motives.

He is a dick head. But in this one specific case he may also be right.
Flooding the market with sell orders would undoubtedly tank the price... and if it got low enough, bitcoin would be largely discredited by the public. 
Are bankers willing to do it, though? That's the question we should be asking. It certainly isn't beyond the realm of possibility.
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:37:25
To illustrate one example:
I have 2 bank accounts. One for work (at one of the top 5 banks in the world). The other at a smaller bank, where I keep my savings.
Every month my boss puts money in the big bank. And every month I transfer that deposit to the small bank. The two accounts are integrated online so I can just hit "transfer."
Yet it takes a full week for the money to actually move. This is ludicrous, and one reason bitcoin appeals to me. 5 seconds vs. 5 days.

Outlaw any merchant transactions that cannot be reversed within a given time period, and call it 'consumer protection legislation.' 
With cash, you get a refund with a receipt. Credit card transactions are backed by the issuing companies.
Essentially, this would require none of the existing institutions to make changes - and it would shoot down bitcoin (at least without the use of an escrow service of some type).

This is precisely right. Also why - in my opinion - BFL and other mining rig production companies are going to be viewed as money-sucking schemes in the long run.
It's also why I don't invest in mining stocks. The dividends now are fantastic - but consider for a moment that successful ponzi schemes pay investors on time, as promised with high interest rates initially. Over time, interest rates decline until payments stop altogether - leaving investors scampering to pull out whatever funds they can.
I really wouldn't be shocked if American Greed does an episode on BFL at some point.

Usually execs aren't so susceptible to this type of crowd mentality (well, at least I'd like to think not). 
The primary reason for this is that they're trained spokespeople who talk to press relatively frequently. So if a reporter walked up to them after the show and said "You raised your hand... can you tell me about your thoughts?" They'd really look like a drooling fool if they had no idea what bitcoin is.

Honest question: how often do you use bitcoin for transferring money back and forth?
I see this as bitcoin's primary strength, but from what I can tell most people hold the currency rather than distribute it to others in exchange for products/services.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:53:28
I'd bet it's a lot higher. In the early days when bitcoins were worth very little, losing 10,000 of them wouldn't even merit much brain space.
Going forward, as value increases, people are much, much more careful with them. So a lot were lost initially and very few will be lost as long as the value is high.

No... you're completely wrong. Let's talk about being accurate.
You want new users to adopt bitcoin, an entirely new transaction system. Adopting a new system requires behavior change. And changing people's behaviors is **tough.** Offering a 5% discount isn't even enough of an incentive to get people to visit a new store, let alone dabble in a new type of currency. You need to make new systems cheap and easy. And that isn't bitcoin right now.

This isn't happening, to my knowledge, because smart phones are way, way, way too expensive to purchase and operate. The phones that are available and relatively widespread are older generation, non-Internet compatible devices. And many people use pre-paid mobile minutes as a form of currency. But in terms of smart phones, adoption is dead before it even got started... there is no way to keep the price point low enough for someone living on ~$1 USD per day.
Also, solar is making a lot of progress... and there are a number of really cool nonprofits driving solar costs down, but most rural communities still have no electricity (and won't for the foreseeable future).
Malaria is a good place to start, because it kills millions of people a year and can be vaccinated against for pennies on the dollar. There are other diseases as well. Then there are millions of people without access to clean drinking water. And food.
All of these things need to be addressed. Ideally in tandem with the internet, but since resources are scarce and non-profits are overtaxed, priorities need to be set.

So your entire goal behind this username is to downvote Reality4You? That's a sad, pathetic existence.

Virtual nations don't make a lot of sense. You are physically vested in the community in which you live. Some things simply cannot be virtualized, as they demand physical, tangible presence.
You need access to food. You need access to hospitals. You need access to shelter. Virtual communities cannot replace these fundamental basics - no matter how badly you want them to.

Soliciting donations in the name of child cancer patients. That has got to be near the all-time low.
Maybe when OP's health is failing him, he'll finally realize that this shit isn't a game.

I suppose being outspoken is one of my traits - for better or worse. I'll accept this and pass it along to Sean on your behalf.

These are informational hearings. There won't be any direct outcome.

There's also the "we promise we'll pay" factor. Who's to say they don't just drain the pool into one of their own bitcoin addresses, and say "here's proof of the transfer?"

Dude lost almost 124 bitcoins.

If you make guns illegal, people do not mysteriously die. 
But more to your point - guns do not deter foreign countries from invading America nearly as well as nuclear weapons do. So I suppose nuclear weapons are a human necessity as well???

I must agree with Haivq. It's a shitty meme.
And regardless, these junk posts have nothing whatsoever of value to offer.
*"Hey, look at me! I'm funny! Really I am! Notice me! Upvote me! I came up with the exact same thing that 10,000 others before me have come up with... but my twist... ***I CHANGED THE TITLE OF MY POST!** *Oh my god, I'm so creative, people should shower me with complements!"*

A lot of people aren't in the position to just up and quit. If you have a family, and work in a competitive field, the landscape changes substantially.

On some level, what you say makes sense. But I really don't think it's that deep. 
Otherwise you could say the green party is a republican concoction designed to splinter off democratic votes. Which I just can't see.

I'd be interested in hearing what kinds of questions they ask you. Nothing sensitive... but generally whether they seem interested, hostile or receptive. I'm sure others reading this thread would be interested as well. Would you mind replying to me in this thread after your meeting?
Also, your list of topics looks pretty solid from my POV. Good luck!

...or with a girl who says she's 14. But then you deserve what's coming when Chris Hansen shows up.

We all know the solution here.

You aren't defending yourself from a pickpocket, genius.

...for all those housewives - who need their kitchens rewired - who also dabble in cryptocurrency.
^(I'm betting there's not a lot of customers willing to pay in BTC.)
