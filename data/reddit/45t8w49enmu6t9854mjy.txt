What is the alternative?  How do people securely store wallet files?

Okay but if I physically remove the networking hardware which the NSA or CIA needs to access the PC via a backdoor, I don't see how it matters whether the entire PC is completely infected - the hardware is gone, unless someone is specifically targeting me and trying to exfiltrate data via obscure things like fan PWM or something, which is so unlikely it's not worth worrying about in my opinion.  
Should I use a Faraday Cage?  This is approaching schizophrenia level paranoia in my opinion, or maybe I'm just not up to date on the latest exploits.
Or are you saying laptops now come with discrete networking hardware to allow backdoors even if the wireless card is removed
Also if you're going to go down this route, why not go down it with hardware wallets as well?  And do you use precompiled Linux kernels or compile it yourself after personally auditing the code?
I understand the concerns but what is the alternative?

Assuming you get a laptop where removing or disabling the wireless card is possible, why does the OS matter?

But would I not need to follow this same process for safely storing my backup seed for the hardware wallet?  I want nothing existing in plaintext anywhere, not in a book in my closet, not in a safety deposit box, nowhere

The only complicated part is the secure environment setup, but that is completely unrelated to the actual storage of the wallet (in which case I'd have to redo this and store my crypto in wallets generated on air-gapped machines again, but presumably I won't get hacked in the short time period between setting up a new laptop and transferring them or something)
In the worst case scenario I could just open the container on any computer and access them.  It's just my wallet stored in a TrueCrypt container, with that complicated secure environment to make it safer to use
