Nope. We had a discussion about it 1 or 2 years ago and he ignored it again. He never replied to the Email.
I remember when i talked to my dad about it when one Bitcoin was about 0,90 dollar cents - he  thinks its a scan and not viable to this day.  
Hes in his late 70ies now and every time there is a Bitcoin article in the newspaper, he cuts it out and shows it to me. :)
I gave up recommending Bitcoin - and lie about how many i have.

Pretty retarded statement when you consider what humans do to this planet in almost every other store of value mining operation.

Everyone telling you should invest in something is probably a shady cunt.
If you read all caps titles with buzzwords, the video is probably made by a shady cunt.
If you hear please check out our site where you can learn about Bitcoin for 199$, the system behind that is probably made by a shady cunt.
Look for people who are in the Business for years and offer free education. They are worth donating too.
I feel like 80% of content about Crypto these days leads you into a scam mine field.

Please make an in depth do it yourself Youtube channel for this.

Every calculation will tell you about 300-350 Days ROI on todays prices for GPUs or ASIC miners. Depends on your electricity cost. I pay 25 cent for a KW/h so its pretty nasty.
Also you have to think about mining difficulty in the next months. Every 2 weeks (+ -) the difficulty finding a block will rise about 16-25%. This means 16-25% less Bitcoin with your current hardware.
If this dip holds on a little, the difficulty will probably decrease or stagnate for a while.
Before you start investing in mining, which you should not at this point if you don´t know what you are doing, educate yourself first what Cryptocurrency and mining is.
You should read and watch first:
[Artile That Explains Bitcoin in general, Segregates Witness and Schnorr Signatures](
[What is a mining Share?](
[Andreas M. Antonopoulos YouTube channel](

Didnt find good coverage in English, so for my english friends:
These quotes came from the BIZ (Bank for International Payment) meeting in Frankfurt, Germany. The BIZ is one of the main Financal institutions in the world.
Said by the head of he BIZ, [Augustín Carstens]( 
More quotes in english from his speech:
"While crytocurrencies had a meteoric rise, let us not forget the core values of public trust the financal institutions have.“
„Private digital coins that shade themselfs as currency, should not undermine this trust.“
„The central banks should not allow this leech like system, that lives from the trust of he current financial world.“
„This is a combination of a bubble a ponzi scheme and a natural disaster.“
And the quote that made me do the post:
"If they [regulators] dont act proactiv, Cryptocurrencies could get intangled, ultimately be stronger then our main finance system and disrupt its stability."
(Iam german, english is not my first language.)

No one knows what will happen with the price.
The only thing that we know is that the technology and future of Bitcoin is very promising. Sit tight.
