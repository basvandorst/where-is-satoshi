I'm not really sure why you would want to be there. Theymos spends all his time censoring this place (when it is on topic!) while letting scams go wild over there. 
Also why not just make a new account if you really need back in?
If you really need the account back I would try spamming theymos or go talk to sirus. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 04:38:43
I have a few of these, if the bid is high enough I'll sell. PM me. Thx

Well, when you report it, it gets seized until you can prove how you got it legally. Money has no rights. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 04:43:08
This is why I quit buying their coins and told them as much. However the foundation is not what it used to be.

That is a good question. I'm 99% sure they are but you should look it up to be sure. Also I think you might be shocked on how high these sell for unless you already have seen some auctions or something. I would refuse an offer of $15,000 for the gold painted one for example.

Yeah, he was talked out of buying a Lamborghini. Still, buying all of these things when you know that your company is so far into debt that it will never recover is still silly. And that is why he went to jail.

No, he just told people they where in their account. People who bought on Gox were not really buying bitcoin but Gox debt. When BTC went to the moon that debt got away from Mark. Now he is in jail for more or less Ponzi.

This is the answer
"I don't think that the forum is responsible for determining whether people are guilty in complicated situations like this. If it turns out that zhoutong is guilty and owes Bitcoinica users lots of BTC, he's not going to be exactly 80 BTC short of repaying everyone due to this ad purchase. He's either going to have the money, or a lot of it will be missing. There's no reason for the forum not to accept this BTC -- it doesn't hurt anyone."

Depending on the amount used and where you are located you might run the risk of the contract being canceled or put out on the street. Contracts only protect people under normal situations. If the electric you are using is several times higher than the rent you are paying you should expect some trouble one way or the other.

Ver is no longer an American but I think he was at the time he made that video. I think shady or questionable is a good way to look at it. Also Mark was a French criminal who was on the run fro fraud in France so he is not exactly Chinese of even Japanese. Vouching for a guy who had fled going to jail for fraud was not exactly smart. Fraud is not the same as mailing explosives. Mailing the explosives I think was stupid but the government way over reacted on that. However for Mark...
@_date: 2015-05-25 08:42:05
It is easy to set up a new company to host a domain. I do not know how many assets they have in Singapore but if that is the only one it would take around 2 weeks and $3000. I doubt Ver could have okcoin locked down by then. Anyway that was assuming Ver could even win in court. I really do not think this contract would hold up at all esp when the other side was asking for a new contract. It is a shitty situation all around and no one is going to win here. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:14:22
Because everything is illegal, or if it is not, might as well report it anyway just to be on the safe side, no one should expect anything different from coinbase. They will odds are report just about every thing anyone does. Sometimes the second bank see's the report and is too lazy to see what is going on, but hey, they rather be on the safe side of things so close the account. This happens over and over again. Do not link coinbase to a bank account you do not want closed.

Coinbase will use the reporting system. If your normal bank that you use to cash paychecks finds coinbase to be a creditable source they will close that as well. You will get your money back in a check form and you will be lucky if you can find a bank to cash it in. Have fun!

Yes, there is no reason to assume that bitcoin can fix the bad debt issue. Because once you give your bitcoins away you have no way to get them back. If anything credit scores will become more important in the future than they are now. Credit scores will also be more accurate as they can be proven to have been loaned out or paid back on the block chain. If anything changes with credit scoring is that it will become decentralized where anyone can see where you have borrowed and payed back the loan. Blockchain is the future of banking.

Could very well happen, I'm not a legal expert but if Ver did sue and did win, what would stop OKC in Singapore from just closing shop? No way that court can do anything in China. Ver would be out even more money even if he is proven to be correct. I'm not sure how any of this is a good idea. Ver's only card seemed to be his ability to make drama, now that has been played what else can he do? 
Also I'm pretty sure in Singapore you can also only sue for actual damages not perceived damages. There is no way Ver is going to get his $200,000. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 15:54:10
Yes, I'm not sure what Ver was thinking when he tried to work with them. This is going to turn out no better for him and the exchange than it did for when he vouched for Gox. At this point other than more drama OKcoin is going to just say take it to court. No way Ver is going to win in China. He is not longer an American so I'm not even sure he can use the US court system. I'm not sure what his options are other than drama. OKcoin can now pretty much just walk away.

Assuming you have 3 more seconds...
"An indestructible public peer to peer digital system that records all types of transactions and records. It can keep track of anything a lawyer, accountant or banker does."
Their reply will be something like "Oh, bitcoin will get rid of the evil ____ " (Blank spot is filled in with who ever of the three they find most evil)

Yes, but why would anyone make a contract with a company that does not exist? I hate to say it but this is why it is worth the money to use lawyers. Then again, it is probably just better and cheaper to risk it and walk away if there is trouble. Only question for OKcoin is will this drama really cost them $550,000.
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:10:50
I understand that and they really should not have done so. However they clearly thought what they were doing was reasonable even if we do not think it was. I might be wrong but I think Ver was the one who made this issue public first going on the attack. Giving context is not a bad thing.

I do not think this is true but some people have said he made the video so he and his friends could pull out most of their funds from MtGox. Being anti Gox and anti Mark since late 2011 did not really make me popular in the community. I did not trust Mark and I did not understand why Ver made that video. Ver also helped stop a lawsuit against Mark related to Bitcoinica coins Mark was holding hostage. Ver had a huge number of coins in that as well so many people including myself just said well, at least he is putting his money where his mouth is and let it go. Anyway I do not think Ver gained by making that video but with all the drama he seems to want might as well toss that out there. 
Edit: I do think that he did mislead people not to make money, but to "help" gox from having a bank run. People were smartly taking out all their funds and Ver talked people out of that. I do think if Ver did not do what he did Gox would have failed 6 months sooner. Ver trying to "help" was not a smart thing to do for himself or the community. He is still paying for that mistake today.

My thoughts on this are that people sold off LTC and moved into BTC. LTC crashed and then as people buy back into LTC after forcing people accounts to margin call BTC will normalize. Not the first time this has happened. LTC lost like 50% of its value in 10 mins and now its almost back to where it was. Easy way to make $50,000,000 in an hour.

Not sure how you are doing maths but $1.09 x 4 = $4.36 and that is less than $4.42.
The current price is over 400% of the low. That was the point I was trying to make. Yesterday at this time it was over 800% if not 850%.

They refused to even give me store credit. Pretty sure its a trap. I dont have a coinbase account and never will. But overstock claims I do so Im fucked.

Not sure "official" is the correct term but you are pretty spot on. I'm wondering however why the are pushing BTC. Maybe they want all the rebels or whatever who watch that to get into it? Not sure really.

I might be wrong on the fiat gains but other wise the lack of liquidity helps force the market move wildly. The lack of liquidity is how we lost 50% of LTC value in 12 hours. 
You might be saying there was not enough trading going on in LTC to move the BTC price? if you check you will see that there was more trading going on in LTC by terms of USD than in BTC that 24 hours. Lots of people clearly moved out of LTC and into something. Only two real options are BTC and Fiat. I think that could have pushed BTC up that much on the Chinese exchanges were much of the LTC was first sold off. 
I might be wrong, just my guess.

There are better more established bitcoin forums out there, some that Ver was even invited to. I see no reason to start a new one just so he has control over it. I also do not expect he will be able to do a better job than the other guys. I'm not sure why he is even doing this.

Waiting until it is about to take over or get close to the value of the international financial market is silly. This his is industry. This is a new tech.

He paid $4,300 plus travel and hotel costs. I'm not sure how long he got her for though. 
Edit: Governor Spitzer, referred to as "Client–9" in an affidavit filed in US Federal Court, arranged to meet at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington on February 13, 2008 with a prostitute named "Kristen." "Kristen" was later identified as the 22-year-old Ashley Dupré. She intended to travel from New York City for the planned tryst and Spitzer agreed in advance that he "would be paying for everything—train tickets, cab fare from the hotel and back, mini-bar or room service, travel time and hotel". After the assignation on February 13, 2008, Spitzer paid her $4,300 in cash. The payment included $1,100 as a deposit with the agency toward future services.

Yet he was paid to do a task of auditing code. He then took that code and made it public. In that code was passwords. He can not be trusted with things that are not his. The problem here is that he has no respect for wealth or material objects his or not his. 
I'd never trust him with a dime or any information. 
What he did might have been an accident, but it might as well have been an attack. In the end, the result was the same. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 06:11:55
Who did then?
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:31:56
They reversed a bunch of purchases when the market did not move in their favor. 
They have also been known to just lock down accounts for no reason. 
Part of it is because the regulations in the usa are crazy. However it makes their actions on the reversed transactions a bit too convenient.

You claim that it was Zhou, but why? How do you know? How do you know it was not Amir and he used it as a cover? 
No, I highly  doubt the relic collector, but that is my point. There is no proof and this is all absurdity caused by Amir publishing code and passwords that he had no right to publish.

@_date: 2015-11-08 14:26:29
No problem. Personally I do not think he took the coins and I'm not even sure posting the passwords in public lead the the theft. But when he published the code with the password, that was way beyond the line even if he did not intend to cause the theft. If a person is paid to audit code, they should never take that code and make it public. So wrong. I personally will not trust him with anything he does again.

As you know Amir made public code that was not his. In that code it had the passwords to an account with Bitcoin and cash. 
Did Zhou Tong take it? Maybe. Did Amir? Maybe. Hard to really say who took it but either Amir let it happen or he gave away that code to cover it up. 
Anyway he should not be trusted with money or of anything with value.
@_date: 2015-11-08 13:20:04
It is well known he published software that was not his. In that code was keys to accounts at Mt. Gox. Shortly after the code was published $50,000 in cash and like tens of thousands of bitcoins were taken. Who took the coins? Some say a Chinese relic trader, others think it was Amir himself. I have no idea but publishing code that he was paid to audit was criminal negligence. Is he in jail? I don't know. 
btw bitfinex is based off of that stolen code. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 00:51:04
They do, some times it is so much it will kill the coin. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 04:33:51
The problem with forgetting this type of criminal act is that he might be able to do it again. It is like when Ver vouches for a guy, people point out what he did before. Never forget. 
You think I'm upset about his actions, I'm not. I'm just pointing out he should not be trusted and why.  
@_date: 2015-11-07 02:37:02
lol! I was wondering how he was getting away with breaking the rules. I do not mind some advertising on a new place but every fucking day more than once? Cash in a Thermos is only thing that makes sense. I'm shocked he still has to go around begging for money. He should have just held onto a few coins...

After looking longer than I should have I figured out how it worked. Hard to guess just by glancing what parts can move. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 00:14:47
You forget about the part where Amir published the passwords to the Gox account making theft more likely. That is assuming Amir was not the one who stole the coins and just did that as cover. Who stole it is speculation. You have no proof. However we do have proof on who made the password and code public. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 03:29:37
I'm not a dev so I don't know but what I was told is that no one trusts his work cuz no one trusts him. You might say it is better but if no one uses anything he has done since bitcoinica, its moot.

Also that Goat user they talk about sure was right about not trusting Mark at Mt. Gox to hold the coins.

Interesting way to look at it. However these things seems to get faster over time. Also the .8% is way low, lower than they even want it. furthermore all the fiat trapped in the "liquidity trap" if it gets out, then flood of fiat everywhere!
Question is, will we get in such trouble in a depression that they try to break that fiat out? If so how soon?

Look at the lock at the far right. It is attached to the post. Unlocking any lock will then free it from the post as they are all connected but by only one point. Once it is free from the post they can move the pole either clock wise or counter clock wise and the door can open. Pretty cool idea and sad we can't see inside the door.

The value of gold is that everyone knows that gold is gold and that you can't make more of it (other than out of the ground). 
The same thing that makes gold have value also makes bitcoin have value. But gold was cool back 6000 years ago where as in the internet age bitcoin is much better.

Thailand. People never really trusted fiat. Then the collapse of the Baht in 98 really scared people. Gold shops everywhere. 
Gold is not perfect, but you did ask why it had value. I made a pretty good case on why at least some people today still value gold. 
Edit: in 98 the Thai Baht pretty much lost 50% of it's value over night. Or the price of gold went up 50% in one night. 
Seeing gold go up 500% in the last 10 or 15 years has people holding onto gold and not fiat. Land and gold are the true signs of wealth here.

because if we do not acquire it and use it to pay taxes we go to jail. 
no one would have ever moved to a fiat system if it was not the ONLY way to pay the government to not kill us or put us in jail. 
Edit: Why the down votes? Is it not true? People were happy to use gold and gold backed paper before the government made it illegal. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 00:30:51
They might be able to do so, but that has nothing to do with the question of why does fiat have value. Fiat has value because the govt say give it to me or die/jail.

Gold and bitcoin both have scarcity. So does beer. Fiat does not have scarcity, it can be printed forever. 
Something with scarcity is going to have more value than something that has no scarcity every time. Once whoever is pushing the fiat can't use violence to support it, it will go to null. Bitcoin, beer and gold will not go to null.

What? How do you know he was in jail and how did you get that from the article? He was arrested in August so there is no way he could have been in jail the whole time and still be in jail if they only get to hold him for 3 weeks. 
Seriously I have no idea where he is. I'd like a source :/

Someone worth a billion dollars did not have guards, or enough guards to stop this?

In 2013 a whole bunch of people in Cyprus bought Bitcoin. Now why did they do that? Why not just leave it in a bank? Well the Government was talking about, and did take a cut off the top of all the bank accounts. The Government stole the money. Okay, so why not just send Euro to a safer bank in the EU? Well the Government prevented that from happening. 
So if the government want to take your money in your bank or stop you from spending it/sending it, they can do so. The government always messes with fiat money, it is just what they do, some times faster, some times slower. 
So now why did they buy bitcoin? Governments can not raid bitocin wallets. Also Governments can not stop a person from sending bitcoin to anywhere in the world. 
So at that time people wanted and needed bitcoin over Euro because the Euro would not do what they wanted them to do. 
Bitcoin is a good way to move and store money. Bitcoin is also a good thing to use over the internet to buy things. Fuck visa and paypal. 
People who would rather use bitcoin to buy a coffee in person rather than using cash however, I just don't get that...

Wow.. your first post, saying the information was in the OP. Wow no wonder you have nothing better to do with your life than post on reddit all day and call names when you are shown how much of a fool you are...   Seriously, I'm done with your trolling and childish name calling. You have been added to my ignore list. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 01:07:39
I'd like to learn more as well. 
I'm a "Honey Badger" myself but couldn't care less what others do related to law enforcement. It can't hurt and might help.

I could see the dollar losing 90% of its buying power in a few years. But then again, maybe not.
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:33:14
You mean did? 
Just because they can do something does not mean they did. Anyway your claim of this being in the link was wrong. You were caught talking out your ass. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 00:49:12
Well it is an interesting question. What will LEA do with all this new information and help? We all know the case of BurtW. They pretty much arrested a guy who was using bitcoins and then said give us money or go to jail. Never went to trail. So, if they were educated would this not have happened? Or will educating them let them know who to target so they can get richer off of civil forfeiture? 
As the money they bring in from civil forfeiture goes down they will look for new targets. I'm not sure I really trust the LEA's seeing what they have done in the past. 
If one runs a drug website then sure, fair target for LEA. If one buys and sells a few bitcoin as a hobby? Well is that worth jail and $300,000 in fines? 
There is no way to know who the LEA will target, real bad guys or just anyone holding bitcoin. Time will tell...

Publishing code that he only had access to because he was paid to audit is not a criminal act?
I'm not saying Zhou is not a criminal. I'm saying Amir should not be trusted and explained why.

@_date: 2015-10-31 05:36:25
I'm glad people are talking about this and pointing out how bad it is but really the govt is going to get all the information it needs anyway. 
I agree with Bruce and he has good points. But the honey badger does not care. If anything it is going to help the image of bitcoin in the minds of the uneducated sheep. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:42:05
Well I'm glad he feels sorry for at levstsome people, maybe not people like Ver or me. 
Still he did fuck up but that seems to have been established.

My only claim is that your claim that all the information was in the OP is clearly wrong. 
Using google will not help anyone here. 3 weeks plus 3 weeks = 6 weeks. You fail to understand that more time has passed than 6 weeks I guess. 
Anyway you are wrong about claiming everything is in the OP. Clearly even your assumptions fall short.

What does Gotat mean? Or is it someone's name? I can't see the questions.

I think your link pretty much covers what he did. If people read your link and understand what he did and why he should not be trusted I'm happy. There is no reason for people to make the same mistake with him more than once. 
I have no problem with him adding open source code to anything if it is helpful. However giving him closed sourced code is not a good idea.

Last time the one in Thailand was pretty awesome.

Lol, like that but run by people who know what they are doing.

Yes you can. You won't make enough bitcoin to pay for the electric. 
If you want BTC just buy it directly or buy a specialized ASIC. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 05:22:24
I see you are new to bitcoin. Scams happen. Best of luck.

He sent it to a guy and have he did it. They agreed on a fee before hand. The guy sent back the coins minus fee. Glad to see honest people like this in the community.

Seems to me he was only arrested in Aug. Held for 3 weeks. Arrested again, then let go. 6 weeks right? Is that not what you told me?
Or do you mean to tell me there is some info missing from the OP? Something you just assumed to be true? Hmm...
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:48:58
3 weeks plus 3 weeks starting in Aug does not = now! 
There is no way man!  Are you telling me he is out now? You just do not know yourself!  Hey man, some dumbass said google might help, you could try that. lol!
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:57:19
Evidence? You said the information was in OP. Clearly it is not. What you said is wrong. 
I can not prove a negative, do not be silly.

Wow, the Feds are busting people before I hear about these scams. Bitcoin is taking off!

You said the info was in the article... Clearly it is not even when you add your made up facts. 
My point is you have no idea yourself and you just talk bull shit.
Sadly I bet this is the best use of your time so carry on....

That would be helpful. In the USA Bitcoin is treated as everything more or less depending on what law enforcement agency one is dealing with.

never had an issue with them. their support is not 24/7 but when it is open it is some of the best. 
i would use them even if they did not accept bitcoin.
