main factor is the uptake by businesses that cash out immediately.
The other is the cumbersome methods required to buy bitcoins via exchanges, this gets put into the too hard basket by many potential adopters.

No i do believe bitcoin prices are manipulated just as diamonds are.
But on a side note, diamonds are plentiful and are certainly not scarce and then there are synthetic diamonds that would fool most people and who knows how many people have purchased what the believe to be a flawless diamond, only to find out years later it was a fake.
online buyers beware!

@_date: 2014-02-19 05:53:23
the fact you are caught up on there only being 21 million available bitcoins. It scales.
For example if you want to buy $100 worth of bitcoins to purchase something from a store that sells items for bitcoins, what difference does it make if you have 1 bitcoin  or 0.1 bitcoin? Are jealous that the first guy got 1 bitcoin for $100 but the same fiat will now only purchase 0.1 bitcoin? the store owner has the opportunity to either sell his bitcoins or keep them, how do they lose? having more coins doesn't mean anything if it can scale to 8 decimal places, it increases volume just on the other side of the decimal.

@_date: 2014-02-19 06:54:31
seriously dude now you just starting to sound jealous. How is the scalability any different to say GOLD for example.
Your $100 will still be $100 but the amount of gold you can purchase is set by the market. You don't need to own a whole ounce of gold, how is bitcoin different? sure the are plenty of ALT coins but there are alternative precious metals too, why not buy an ounce of silver instead of a gram of gold for example, no reason why not at all if the market believes it has value.

I can see your point if you buy and sell BTC with the goal of making a profit. But if I buy a bitcoin and then transfer say 0.2 to a different wallet for spending and it just so happens that the price doubled since I bought that BTC as I buy a coffee, how does capital gains work then?
The IRS will get tangled up in it's own red tape but buying and selling BTC on a trading platform makes it easier to track i guess.

True, the OS does not matter in the overall scope of bitcoin because bitcoin itself is so fluid and not even the gatekeeper at Apple can stop it. 
The OS does matter when it comes down to personal preference. The Apple OS is just another Operating system based off of Unix and me personally (personal preference) I find the GUI limiting and clunky.
Whether apple is conspiring against bitcoin or not, I really don't care personally. I have a mac and an iphone and my wife loves them, just not for me.

When you are not using what you own then you are borrowing. While you may hold money in a bank account or hold cash that can cover that amount owing, at anytime, you are still running the risk of some unforeseen circumstance that may cause you to stumble off your carefully laid out plan and royally screw you big time.

When they speak of each bitcoin being worth as much as that I think also at that point, owning 1 BTC would be a rare event as well. 
The only reason we would see a value so high is because it would have been accepted by society at large as a currency and the finite amount of bitcoins would be slowly divided into smaller denominations and sold off. Don't forget it was designed to handle transactions to the eighth decimal place. It's not impossible to see future common trades at the amount of 0.001 BTC.
So predicting amounts of 100,000+  is not so hard to believe just hard to believe that people would continue to hold onto their rounded 1 BTCs.

The news itself is not suprising at all, that the chinese government would react so strongly against bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:06:55
I predict bitcoin will sharply rise, followed a by deep fall,  followed by another spike in the price.
Rinse and repeat

I buy my bitcoins through BTCmarkets.net and fund it using a commonwealth account, never had a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:11:10
i'm talking more mainstream but yeh any alt coin could fill that roll
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:02:12
privileged rich hipsters usually just ride the second or third wave though.
rarely will you see them on the 1st even if they do say they were riding the wave before it even formed.

It would be interesting to compare stats, how many apple users compared to android or other OS users, actually use bitcoins.
Then also look at how many people that actually sign the petition who actually use an iphone/ipad.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:34:22
bitcoin is dead now that china has stamped their boot down.
bahahaha, yeh right.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:06:31
Bye Bye to the speculative chinese gamblers, um sorry *investors.

BTC-e is a massive scam waiting for the final act
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:43:37
people like me salivating on the sidelines, waiting to buy more cheap bitcoins :P
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:55:49
you work in PR right? or you are just gushing for coinjar so much?
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:14:53
MOAR MONITORS!!!! and less aple coz they suxx

Good write up and 100% agree with you. A lot of people jumping on the current altcoin speculative bubble are going to be hurt big time when the dump finally comes.
"Altcoins are the penny stocks of the Bitcoin world"

Yeh sorry didn't mean to come across as a harsh judgement.
Response was more aimed at all the unsolicited requests you most likely are now bombarded with. good luck

While the price keeps rising more people are going to want to sell their goods to get in on the action and could even gamble  that as prices are rising they could offer substantial discounts with a strong possibility of a higher return.
What currency offers that opportunity?
PS: nobody wants to be "that guy" buying the pizza, but there certainly are many opportunities just waiting to be realized. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:44:40
well you play the markets and the markets play you. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:36:51
And without Bitcoin there would be no altcoin. If bitcoin fails, I don't see another miraculously taking up the baton and continuing the race with much success.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:38:38
heh, but it is good news in the sense that we no longer have to listen to "China is about to wake up, Arise chikun"
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:57:27
what a load of crap, The author of that article obviously does not get it and the article reads like a product of the 90's... oh wait ;P
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:18:54
Isn't that the coin created to placate the banksters/fraudsters? Making them feel secure that there is a centrally controlled currency that can be controlled ie: manipulated.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:35:40
I think there are so many other, better ways orders could be placed. Keep the bitcoin system for settling the bill.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:05:07
Bitcoin, the guardian against rising inflatiion?
Possibly the next central currency?
As more and more people want a slice of this pie, the slices will inevitably get smaller and each bitcoin increases in value.
Sure gold is great but isn't it just another benchmark for what a bitcoin is worth?
Please correct me if I am completely off on this.

the name of the Gyft support guy was aasif?
as if?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:29:27
I guess you would have advised him the same thing back in September too? 
It's only cost him 1.5k and who knows where it can go. i'm sure he will be fine either way. Good on him for putting his faith into something new and exciting as bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:19:09
the reason $1000 will be trivial is because my $100 here and there still converts to BTC  just fine.
Get out there and spend a little people, that will increase it's value even higher.
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:50:28
yeh good luck with that. Aussies are pretty slow on the pickup , but give us time ;)
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:26:27
haha nice score but next time think before you decide to brag.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:23:48
China as a nation, is a control freak.
At first they dismissed it as a pure folly but when it started to actually pose a potential threat to their grand schemes, we are now seeing the consequences.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:29:42
How to get your 15 minutes of fame these days: write an article about bitcoins.
Seriously that guy doesn't deserve any discussion or recognition.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:27
This sell of is a little different to normal panic sells.
The huge price gains that came along with the Chinese news is now going into reverse.
It's going to be sub $1000 for some time to come
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:09:21
best advice yet.
Leave Apple alone, people!
They don't  need your business, stop acting like groupies and throwing your money at them. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:25:10
The current surge in alt coins is pure gambling and greed at it's finest. Sure it will make some very rich, but for most, they will be cursing the day they ever heard about cryptocurrencies.
At least Bitcoin devotess have put in the groundwork to enjoy the success of where it is today.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:43:18
looks like a landlord trying to cash in on the bitcoin boom at the renters expense. Rentals should use a system like bitpay and not a set BTC price
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:06:24
