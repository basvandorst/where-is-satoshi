I feel like for anyone that isn't already familiar with linux, adding that into the slew of things required for safe keeping of bitcoin will only add more FUD for the person trying to secure their BTC.

I'm not saying China is out for good, I'm just saying I don't see why Bobby Lee's statements these past few days are being seen as positive by people, when there really has been no progress and nothing has changed about deposits not being allowed and a deadline for CNY withdrawal.

I think it's more like... bitcoin is the blockchain, but the blockchain is a lot more than bitcoin.

Bobby Lee's update was insubstantial, and no more positive than his last statement.
