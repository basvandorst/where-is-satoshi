Considering that you couldn't even come up whit a metaphor that doesn't invalidate your own stance I'd go with you being ignorant on this one.

Unlike you I've directly engaged your writing so even if my engagement wasn't rational you should not have any problems showing why it is not rational. You decided not to. The only conclusion one can get from that is that you don't know why my writing is not rational.


I actually did, my point was to show that not everybody is looking for the same thing and thus having "bad" reputation doesn't have to mean lose of profits. It seems that you are simply incapable of grasping that.


I never said anything about you showing disdain or anything similar. Now you are showing that you have no reading comprehension skills.

Notice that in your three comments today you in no way engaged in what I wrote. The only conclusion anybody can make from that is that you actually have no idea what you are talking about. 
Have a nice day.

You gave a metaphor in which, even tho one gains a certain kind of reputation it doesn't prevent them from being "profitable" in a similar vein as those without that reputation. Your claim was that such a change in reputation would make them in lose profits but your metaphor in no way at all demonstrated such a thing. 
So no, you did not.

Bitcoin being more mobile doesn't make it a better store of value. 


I can't read this and not think that you either don't know what you are talking about or you are lying .

Unless somebody is paying you more than you are losing.


I'm not ignoring it. I actually addressed it. Also, people date somebody who cheated on their partner all the time so you're just making my point.


They can trust them because they are a big client. An individual or a smaller company would not trust them but they are not as profitable as the big guys so the company would not care.

Not technically, it is a theory. In science you can't get better than that.

So it took a fucking world war so a nation could steal a large amount of Gold. Are you here arguing for bitcoin or gold because it doesn't take a world war nor a nation to steal a large amount of bitcoin.

If it profits them of course they will. If a big client wants something from a firms smaller client it would be in the interest of the security firm to provide it for their big client. That would signal to other big customers that this company is willing to go out on a limb for them and thus would hire them bring in more money.

Yes, today it is easier to store and transfer some value in gold than the equivalent in oil or iron. But than the question arises. Why is gold more valuable than oil or iron? It certainly isn't because it is easier to transfer 1Kg of gold than 1Kg of iron.

You are missing the point

If code is law then nobody stole anything. If it isn't then I see no point to ethereum.
