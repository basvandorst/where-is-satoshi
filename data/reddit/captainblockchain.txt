I have verified mails before with the mail address that I now cannot reach, and when I waited more than 5 minutes it used to say that I had to do it all over again because the time had run out. So I doubt its counting down letting me wait up to 2 days to verify it.
I have already verified the change of adress on my new mail and it was approved.
I mean the whole point of a reset is because you do not have access to the old mail address so how could you verify the change to a new address with the old one. That doesn't make any sense dude.

I just went back to the login page again and signed in, when the text box  about verifying with your email appeared i used the firefox inspect element and found a json link and it said " initial\_error" A two factor authentication reset request is currently pending approval in 2 day 2 hours 11 minutes. For more information click the Reset Two Factor Authentication Button." I guess I just have to wait and see if it works when the approval BS is over.
I will never use a web wallet ever again in my life even if it's just for a small transaction. I know it's just a couple of hundred $ worth of BTC at the moment but BTC sure is volatile and those couple of hundred $ could be thousands in a number of years. So I guess I solved it myself. 
BTW 
I would like to thank all of you telling me how worthless web wallets are instead of trying to help me out.

I understand, if I ever get my BTC back I will transfer it back to the good old Bitcoin core wallet. I just didn't have time to download 200 + GB of blockchain and synch it. I created this so called wallet because I needed to receive a transaction fast and I didn't have access to a computer with a core wallet but thanks for being so helpful explaining to me that this is not [blockchain.info]( support. Because if this was [blockchain.info]( support I would have been amazed that someone actually replied to my question.

[Blockchain.info]( says
" A Wallet ID is only used for the  login process, and it's different from a receiving address. In other  words, it can't be used to send or receive funds. Do not send funds to  your wallet ID. **For security reasons, we strongly recommend you don't share your Wallet ID publicly, or with anyone. "**
So please let me know how you could help.
