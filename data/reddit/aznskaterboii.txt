I believe that it does occur at a single exchange and since data for btc price constantly gets refreshed, prices drop because of either stop losses and bots. But my money would be on stop losses. If this answered your question...since other answers were just random answers.

Dont be retarded bro

Good. More btc for the people

Valid questions, but wrong place to do it. People are physically emotionally financially invested in crypto, so they dont want a wet blanket ruining their experience. Your post is inevitably a waste of energy. Try playing games and spam there instead.

Well that night i had a couple of windows opened. While being right handed, it was..occupied doing something else. But I did use my left hand to click my laptop button for the purchase.

.... i thought you buy bitcoin on coinbase and send to binance. I have no idea what you do... i wouldnt call my self a novice either..

If you want to preserve your currency value, then it can be yes and no because price fluctuates. But if youre after btc value, then yes because btc can only correct its-self before shooting higher.

Isnt food cheap in thailand? Why is it such a big deal? Are you really upset because you couldnt pay in bitcoin? Are you really one of those people who get upset when things slightly go differently for you? Youre on vacation in thailand correct?      
       Why spend the energy to bash something when you can easily move on? What if that meal in 5 years cost as much as a used car? Its just hard for me to wrap my head around this post.
      My point is many businesses have marketing techniques to attract guests, and since crypto is clearly unregulated and not understood by the general population, you can name your business anything and people will come anyways.
    I rather use cash, than use my bitcoins because I understand that bitcoin is basically gold to me. You wouldnt pay for your meals in bits of gold will you?
Ps. I love thai food. Thom kha and chiang mai sausages are delicious.

Maybe youtubers can give you insight

I think btc crashed multiple times before even hitting 8k. We all want to get rich. Just either cash out and come back when you feel the bottom is near
