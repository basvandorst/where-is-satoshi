CSW said the trust contains the bitcoin keys/wallet in an encrypted container with a key that has been distributed across multiple trustees. Those are the keys he is talking about
The judge actually understands it better than CSW - Craig testified that the keys are distributed using a Shamir Secret Sharing scheme and he doesn't know who has some of the keys nor which order they go in. The judge corrected him in saying that with a Shamir Secret Sharing the order is irrelevant.

CSW knows Kleiman isn't Satoshi - he took advantage of a dead man for an advanced fee scam

It's a bit disappointing that there are people who go out of the way to go the court room, pay their own way, take notes inside the court, run outside and live tweet them to then only have people rip the content and take the credit
Here are two accounts that were there live and reporting it:
Katie is asking [for tips here](
edit: [the docket]( has been updated with the first part of the transcript up on PACER - trying to get access to it now (don't have an account)
edit: just had it confirmed that Katie and  were the only two people in the public gallery at the court room today - so everything you're reading in terms of reporting on the proceedings today is a result of their tweeting, there was no other media (crypto or otherwise) there

the judge describes it in [his order]( as one of his findings down on page 24
he even published an appendix describing how [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( scheme works 
It's worth getting the full context though by reading the entire document, as he first sets out all the things that CSW said and then goes into detail on why he was wrong and lying. Calling him out on the secret sharing scheme was just one part of it, although an impressive one as the judge found that himself rather than relying on any testimony or expert witness submitted by the plaintiff 
It really is worth going through it all and [the transcript]( - this is a heck of an interesting and incredible case
edit: here is [the specific section from the transcript](

I'm about to but it was more in reference to the original tweet - once someone with a large following picks up a story and takes it it's almost already all over
The transcript from today should be available on PACER soon - apparently the judge tore CSW to shreds so it should be interesting reading

The judge said the Tulip Trust doesn't exist - he didn't award any amount of bitcoins, but rather *all bitcoin mined by CSW and Kleiman* from the date of their agreement until Kleiman's death
That could be 1.1M bitcoin (unlikely) or it could be zero (more likely)
He also recommended awarding costs to Kleiman
Further he said CSW perjured himself and produced forged documents but has not as yet recommended criminal action for contempt 
This decision won't be ratified until later when it goes back to the trial judge

QR codes are a just Bitcoin URI scheme encoded per [BIP-21 which specifies that the amount is optional]( - if it's not included most apps will prompt you for it

goes to pre-trial in January and trial at some point next year
the trial judge needs to affirm the decision from this magistrate judge who oversaw the contempt of court motion

This case is still in early days - they'll get there eventually
This lawsuit will be CSW's undoing - expect the DOJ to get involved at some point when it heats up
edit: i'd go further and say the DOJ are already on him, just keeping a low profile
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:36:39
Yep but that has never stopped the DOJ - they claim jurisdiction on things as small as one of the parties having a bank account in the USA or a single victim in the USA 
This case feels like it would be high profile enough that a careerist prosecutor would pick it up and pursuit it a good deal. You don't just come out as Satoshi, make all this noise, be accused of fraud, defraud the Aus government, get involved with Calvin Ayre (lol) and *not* get the attention of one of the DOJ offices.
It's also interesting that Australia stopped pursuing him for the tax fraud after he fled the raid - they could easily extradite him from the UK. I suspect this is because there is a broader cross-jurisdictional investigation taking place that is larger
I'm just reading between the lines - i'd suspect that at some point there will be an unsealed indictment, a couple of arrests (prominently CSW) and a big media deal about it. I actually wouldn't bet against it.
