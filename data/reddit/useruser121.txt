I was able to buy one via credit card (the max they would allow for now).  The other 2.x was just under the max they would allow via bank account.  Now when I look on coin base they have "changed" the bank account parameters, saying that they will only allow a small fraction of that.  Several days later.... after confirming my purchase.

Ha.  Don't feel like a dick.  I realize I'm entering a shady area.  Ill reach out to them on Monday.  For the record, I have all of the verifications in place and have used both credit card and bank account.  It was the bank account that was reversed.  Heres the email.  It sucks because Im trying to lay a foundation where I can get into this in a predictable way going forward.  The links they provided to "further increase security" have all been fulfilled prior.
