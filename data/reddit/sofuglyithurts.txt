I don't think BTC is big enough to trust vendors in that department. And the extra step through Gyft really isn't that hard or time consuming. Then you have access to the power and services with Amazon.

Part of me says the US government won't do anything against Bitcoin until the FBI cashes out the max possible profit on the seized coins. Then they'd be free to take action after reaping a cool income.

I think most people here agree that this is really just a placard value established by BoA in an attempt to stay relevant. Bitcoin will continue to grow at it's own rate justified by we the users.

Last time I checked there were no good apps to use with Bitcoin in iOS. I wouldn't trust anything yet. Lately I've been checking market prices just through Chrome Browser on Coinbase.com

1. Buy Amazon gift cards with BTC via Gyft.com
2. Buy home brewing supplies through Amazon

Umm, use a different transaction service?
I've bought and sold bitcoins using both Western Union and Moneygram without a hitch, from multiple different accounts. If you use your brain and do basic research you can do yourself and the community a favor.
