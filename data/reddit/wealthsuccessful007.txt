I'm Bullish on Bitcoin, well I'm bullish on the Crypto Market in general! In this vid I touch on why I am bullish on both... I also talk about a crypto gem near the middle part of this vid. I'll give you a hint, ROLEX... And at the end of this vid for a brief moment I touch on the powerful Secret that King David gave to King Solomon...

All is well. A correction is very healthy. Abundant Blessings!

I agree. But all in all, that does not matter. What matters is that people understand, that we are in a healthy correction. To not fear, and to not be greedy and to wait this out. This Bull Market will continue.

 Welcome to the financial markets. It can get corrected %50 too! But who gives a flying Fk... This is all healthy! Longterm this will show as a healthy correction! This actually proves that this crypto market is for real! Veteran investors love this... Why? Because it creates new opportunities for new investors. This is how a market grows! This is how a bull market continues to another level! Btw, it gives a lot of credibility to the crypto market. Nothing goes straight up. I love THIS!!!!!

Guys we are so blessed to see the future in the now! And what's the future? BLOCKCHAIN TECH! We are so ahead of our time. We are truly blessed to be able to see now, what will take many others to see later on. And that means our return on our investments is going to be massive. That's why I preach against day trading cryptos, because in 2 years we can see life changing money! Guys these are exciting times for blockchain tech, and to be invested in it as well! Let's GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

Once you get a hit of this superman-cocaine Cryptocurrency Market, you get hooked! I believe that there's a ton of optimism to stand on, and that we, who believe in the tech of cryptos, and who are invested in cryptos, should be really excited!

I might be wrong, but ONCE EVERYONE who's involved in btc and in cryptos, truly figures out that they will be receiving an equal match of FREE b2x for every bitcoin they have during the fork, the crazy this btc pump might get. With both btc and bitcoin gold there was a ton of confusion, but with this bitcoin-fork there is not! Look for btc to pump, and then dump after November 16. Again, Coinbase has already said they will match! And Gdax also has confirmed they will be doing the same. So there is no confusion with this one! We have already seen pt1 and pt2, Now people know what to expect. I personally will not sell my altcoins, but I will participate in both the free b2x and what I expect to happen, the altcoin sale. I have my money ready to attack! Again, I believe that once the majority understands what coinbase and gdax are doing, the sooner we see some crazy pumps for btc! Yes there are risks involved in this as well. So  Guys, be careful! Do not let fomo get the best of you! For example, If I did not know what to do, my best option would be, to not do anything. And then just wait till the dust settles... Altcoins may take a hit, but after the 16th of November, I believe we will see a massive Altcoin bull run! Some might try to time this, and sell their altcoins, but they could get burned, and lose out on the sweet positions that they are in. Again, I will not be one of those gamblers! Again, please be cautious. I never do any investments out of fomo! Not financial advice!

Forget about the phone... Look at where we are heading! Guys once Androids and Apple phones start to implement this angle of blockchain tech on their devices, we will all be closer to mass adoption for bitcoin and all other legitimate altcoins.
