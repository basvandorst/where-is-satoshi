Can you explain how this doesn't reintroduce the double spending problem which bitcoin was designed to solve? 
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:15:10
The hashtag though

A lot of special people out there really want to see Bitcoin succeed, because it validates their decision to buy in.  They can lean back in their chair and say "I'm so smart for getting into Bitcoin, I knew it wasn't a scam."

Yes.  This is why locations with no functioning government like Somalia are such wonderful places.

Right now?  Get long, get loud.  In that order.

Good.  A tax system should not reward those most willing to cheat.

Cheap money.  Borrowing at tiny interest rates, more incentive to borrow, with more borrowing is more money creation.  More money to buy assets, prices go up.

If he has assets, he will get the loan.  Lenders want to make money at least as much as customers want loans.
I've had banks give me shit over all kinds of stuff, mostly relating to online poker, but if you put your foot down they always cave and approve the loan.

In what sense is this a "bear market"?
Also, Warren Buffet says to invest in companies (people doing things), not "things" themselves.

Wouldn't it be an interesting development for bitcoin if official White House accounts are including bitcoin info in their tweet-and-deletes?  You don't have to presume it nefarious to wonder what it's about or think it's interesting.
Does the timing imply someone added the code after the tweet was sent?  If that's the case, it seems less interesting.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:03:06
Yes.  He deleted it.

So what did Hal's group do with the Satoshi keys?  And why?
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:24:18
That punishes good generous people and rewards selfish bad people.  Compulsory participation is a lesser evil.
@_date: 2016-05-05 02:38:37
If all of the burden for caring for the unfortunate is shirked by selfish pricks and falls on their backs.

I'm not saying it's not more likely.  I'm saying we can't say "No Sean Spicer didn't."  The evidence simply doesn't show that.
Suppose he was interacting with someone who gave him instructions to use a certain code for both things to verify identity and connect the account.  In that case the order wouldn't matter, or at least, Spicer might not appreciate the importance of the order in the unlikely event someone else would "scoop" the code from his Twitter and use it in a bitcoin transaction that same day.  The important thing would be that the code appeared both places.
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:22:11
Why does he present a bunch of correct information and then falsely assume "No Sean Spicer Didn’t Make Some Secret Bitcoin Transaction".
That's an affirmative statement about what didn't happen.  We don't know this.  We only know that the evidence is consistent with other possibilities.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:47:15
I agree that the tweet is 100% linked to the bitcoin transaction.
What purpose would this tweet serve?  Why use an official account for this identity verification?  It seems very odd.
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:17:06
"Compare its input script with:"
Can someone explain what "input script" is being referred to here?
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:18:30
He wouldn't be giving them away but paying back supposed "advances".
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:12:15
Unfortunately I think this analysis is somewhat flawed.
The string itself is only _assumed_ to be an identity verification code.  In fact it is an arbitrary string that was attached to the transaction _after_ the tweet was sent.
So it's more than plausible that some random person added it as an annotation to the transaction after copying it from Spicer's tweet, and Spicer knows nothing about it.

"Pranked"?  Come on, he had a scheme here, but he chickened out of following through on it, probably because he realized he'd be caught or it couldn't work.
But... what was the scheme?
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:21:38
That's what I'm thinking now too.  Are there time zone issues to consider?
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:50:00
Unless... he's a fraudster, Satoshi, *and* lost the keys at some point.

The picture which seems to be forming for me is that Craig is a scammer who has privately used the false claim of being SN to run up huge debts on the premise that he has access to $500M in Bitcoin.  His creditors have become suspicious and are forcing him to "prove it or else".  This is why we're seeing this desperate attempt to "verify".
All the old bits of planted evidence were to support the ongoing scam of claiming to be backed by SN's coins.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:51:33
Unless, of course, you never actually paid it.  In which case it is free money.
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:12:33
The writing style is very strong evidence against IMO.  Maybe this is "Satoshi" in the sense of someone using his name, but it is highly unlikely to be the author of the whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:21:21
How does forging a blog post make any sense though?  The real Gavin will disavow it and the jig is up.

Because people who need hospital care aren't often capable of generating income.
So basically you're asking if people should just be left to die in the gutter if they become ill.
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:51:22
Agree it's very unlikely.  
@_date: 2016-05-13 13:41:53
Hardly conclusive.

Perhaps the story of DPR-1 and DPR-2 was an attempt to dissociate himself from his prior mistakes that he was keenly aware of?
