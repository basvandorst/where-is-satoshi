copy the config file to your home directory and add BCH
    cp /usr/local/lib/node_modules/currentsee/example_config.json ~/.currentsee

the histogram running from right to left confused me for a bit.
I'd prefer a fixed width text box as I set my window just barely large enough and when the box grew things got wacky
But I love it.  thanks

i dont think testnet coins are allowed to have value.  if  they gain value then the testnet is reset( for lack of a better word)

My ElectrumX server crashed because of this issue.  I had to change the config file to state NET = "bitcoin-segwit"
I had read this earlier but was thinking I was good until I updated the server, but I was mistaken.  Noticed the issue when the electrum client said the server was lagging and it was 32 blocks behind.
I can sorta understandhow my existing server didnt know how to process the data once segwit kicked in.  My Electrumx server only connects to my bitcoin core full node so I know electrumx was getting data from a core node.
Yes it is troubling the way the author of electrumx defined the chains.  Other comments in this thread point to forks of electrumx but I think this is the definitive version.
 .  Well at least it is the one pointed to by the original electrum server.  .  I am curious now if  Thomas Voegtlin is still going to support Neil kyuupichan version of electrumx.  I'm openminded ( and probably uninformed )about big/small/segwit but the naming of the chains in electrumx is not impartial.

How I got this running on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.
The order of commands probably isnt perfect but its how I worked around the errors that I ran into
thanks for the program !!
    sudo apt-get install npm
    sudo npm install -g currentsee
    #  "/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory"
    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy 
    #  SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class)
    # not yet supported outside strict mode 
    sudo npm install -g npm
    sudo npm install -g n
    sudo n stable
    currentsee 
then to copy the global config to your home directory for customization
    cp /usr/local/lib/node_modules/currentsee/example_config.json ~/.currentsee

Just cant help but think after seeing posts like this or 'found' hard drives or wallet.dat files that least some of these posts are BS.  But I never see anyone calling them out ??

Been there, done that. Got the T-shirt!
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:07:05
true.  Plus after I looked further down the post I did see some comments similar to mine.

I have gotten 'bash otp' to work well for me on linux. MIT license.

Regarding bitcoin-qt:  I've been able to run that INSTEAD of bitcoind, but not use it to connect to my existing bitcoind.  Can you point me in the direction on how to connect to mu remote node ?
Have read about electrum server.  Was hoping not to have to utilize that as a middleman.
I'm just surprised there isnt a linux gui that uses the connection like the command line bitcoin-cli.
Thanks for the replies
