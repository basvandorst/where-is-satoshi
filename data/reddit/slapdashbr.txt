Let me put it to you this way- Bitcoin operates in a legal gray area. If the general public finds out that hackers are infecting millions of computers to "mine bitcoins", even if the general public doesn't really understand the purpose of bitcoins or the potential benefits, they can create lots of public pressure to move bitcoins from "legal gray area" to "really fucking illegal". Which would render bitcoins useless, as they still need to be exchanged for other currencies if you want to use them for anything other than online transactions between a small number of tech-savvy people.

Edit: you know what I like even less than Austrian economists? redditors using downvotes to suppress a comment they disagree with
Yes. 
I'm a chemist by profession and a technological junkie; I love the nature of bitcoins and how they cleverly use cryptography and math. 
But as a scientist, I am appalled at the popularity of what you might call Austrian Economics in the modern world; their ideas hold no water in a time when you can access and analyze mountains of economic data. For whatever reason, most self-described Austrians are strong libertarians and the appeal of bitcoins to them is mostly about the privacy and anonymity (which are good features). However they usually seem to be the same crowd that worries about fluoride in the water supply and the federal reserve acting like a secret cabal.

What exactly do you call Keyensian economics? MMT? Like I said, it is no more "Keynesian" than modern biology is "Darwinism".

If modern economists are wrong, they try to identify what is incorrect in their model and improve it. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:39:50
That is incorrect. The individual miners contributing do not have sufficient knowledge of what the rest of the pool is doing to prevent malicious manipulation. It wouldn't take long to realize the pool had been used to double-spend, but it could take long enough to essentially destroy trust in the entire bitcoin system.

They simply haven't developed the infrastructure we are used to. Some day hopefully not to far in the future, banks will work efficiently almost anywhere in the globe as well as they currently do in the developed world.

That, to me, is the highest utility of bitcoins. 
I need dollars because that's how I have to pay my taxes, even if I can buy everything else I need with bitcoins. I don't care to speculate on the increasing or decreasing value of bitcoins vs dollars. My ideal use for bitcoins is to obtain them with dollars when i need them for a purchase and use them immediately. If I want to sell anything with bitcoins, I would not want to hold onto the bitcoins for long, or I risk losing value.

probably, because that would decrease it's value. Or hopefully I would sell my gold before it was made illegal. Bitcoins aren't as bad, because they can be used anonymously (unlike say, having a block of "illegal" gold to unload on the black market), but it's still a discouragement for merchants to accept them. That leads to a situation where most people can't use bitcoins for important purcahses, and thus most consumers don't want anything to do with them.

I would argue that Austrian Economics is not a serious social science anymore, in fact as an "intellectual discipline" it is decidedly non-intellectual.

Heh. Well I think the big question for digital currency, especially with a p2p distributed, anti-central-control network, is "how do we maintain stable prices?" Frankly, maintaining economic growth *and* stable prices at the same time is one of the biggest struggles that central banks have to deal with. Maintaining just stable prices should be easier, but then doing so in a completely decentralized manner makes it harder again. And I'm not a good enough economist to figure out how. (Sorry I'm a chemist)
You reminded me of an old science fiction short story where in the future, human currency is backed not by gold, but by guaranteed delivery of kilowatt-hours of solar power. That had its own unanswered questions, namely not specifying the rate of delivery (power, as in joules per second) of the guaranteed energy (which is just joules). As we know, producing 150 joules at 10W takes a cheap battery and 100 seconds, producing 150 joules at 150W takes only a second but requires a much higher power source or fancy capacitive circuits. But I digress.

The problem with bitcoin isn't that it doesn't depreciate (0% inflation), the problem is that it anti-depreciates (negative inflatio). Sorry for the linguistic gymnastics, what I'm trying to say is that any amount of deflation is quite a bit more harmful to an economy than the equivalent amount of inflation, and both are worse than stable prices. Bitcoin is naturally deflationary, that's a huge drag on getting people to actually spend it, if people are reluctant to spend it, of what use is it in solving the problems a digital currency could potentially solve? 


The risks of identity theft beyond credit card fraud are infinitesimal. What exactly is the risk to a typical consumer that someone will steal their identity? 
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:23:43
Note that the argument against inflation is exactly the opposite, although usually phrased more nicely than "productive people are stealing from non-productive." Of course those "non-productive" include mainly children of the "productive" i.e., employed, retired people with inflexible incomes, and people who derive their income primarily from investments rather than wages. 
As a flaming liberal, borderline socialist, I prefer inflation with high employment more than low inflation with high unemployment, but that more than deflation with any level of employment because that hurts the poor more than the wealthy. That's a purely political and moral opinion, but I think it is fairly obvious that the ideal situation is high employment with as little inflation as possible. It kind of blows my mind that some people think a deflationary currency is great. Deflation is only great if you hold a lot more currency than everyone else. Deflation is terrible for most people, by definition, because it leads to lower overall productivity- lower standards of living for everyone except a minority of the most wealthy. This is why we don't use a gold standard anymore. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:44:51
here's a problem I see: if the currency is obviously deflationary by design, it is foolish to spend it at any point in time because tomorrow it will be worth more. That is a very bad thing if we want people to start using bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-03-28 16:11:08
I honestly have a feeling a lot of people interested in bitcoins don't understand in what way they are or are not valuable. As you say, they are intrinsically worthless to an even higher degree than paper money, which at least you can burn. In fact there is a non-trivial cost to owning bitcoins since you have to store them on some computer type device which probably costs a decent amount of money. They are incredibly useful for making anonymous transactions to anyone else on the internet- but without a stable conversion rate, or at least a predictably changing one, who will want to sell you anything in bitcoins? If a btc is $50 today and $60 next week, buyers will not want to spend their bitcoins, not to mention sellers will be pressured to lower prices constantly. It's the classic deflationary spiral without a central bank to print money. 
I don't think that it is a fatal flaw, *IF* people stop trying to speculate in btc conversion rates and instead focus on using it as a digital medium of exchange... but you can't force people to not speculate.

But given how finely bitcoins can be divided, and how easy it is to convert bitcoins to other currency, the final price of bitcoins will be determined simply by how quickly or slowly they can be recirculated. Since it will be in the seller's interest to attract business with lower prices, eventually they will get very good at turning around bitcoins quickly and cheaply.

I agree that the price changes have been too rapid and driven mostly by speculation. The worst thing is, NO ONE can possibly know what a good stable long-term value for bitcoin is going to be... it depends on the volume of transactions (for real goods, not trading) that use bitcoins vs. how long it takes to process them. Frankly I think people are hoarding bitcoins right now and there is going to be a pretty substantial profit-taking correction at some point.

@_date: 2013-04-15 13:56:12
Part of the problem with bitcoin is its natural deflationary tendancy that arises from havig a fixed limit to how many can ever be in circulation. This was a design decision that was not necessary; bitcoins could have been rewarded at the same rate for mining indefinitely, or the rewards even adjusted based on a target price of bitcoins per dollar/euro/yen/some weighted average of global currencies. That probably would be hard to do but I think I'd prefer a loose peg to "government" currencies than the wild speculation that we have seen lately. Krugman is right in that monetary policy has to be able to adjust to the economic environment. With bitcoin's structure, there is NO flexibility in the implicit "monetary policy", which is to say, how many bitcoins can and will be produced. 
As a technology for making anonymous, peer-to-peer transactions anywhere in the globe that has internet access, bitcoin is awesome. It is a work of genius. But as an alternative currency, bitcoin has fatal flaws. I don't think bitcoin will last. It may struggle on for a few more years but eventually I think someone will develop a similar currency with features that allow for natural price stability and discourage hoarding. Bitcoin is a very novel technology. It is fascinating, but it isn't perfect and it will be replaced by something better. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:58:52


It depends what the rate of deflation is. If I expect $100 of bitcoins to buy me $102 of goods next month, no, I'm not going to wait. If I expect it to buy me $500 of goods next month, damn straight I'm going to hoard them. 
Bitcoin prices have been skyrocketing so fast in the last couple weeks, it is stupid to actually spend them... but if you can't spend them, why have them to begin with?

The amount of fluoride in water is not harmful. It's probably not really effective, either, but I'm not a dentist. 
My point is people who are concerned about fluoridation of our water supply, such as yourself, are not actually aware of the real risk. 
Fluorosis is almost exclusively a problem in rural areas which are not actually connected to a public water supply, but rather get their water from wells that are not as carefully monitored. If the water supply is fluoridated at the level of 1 ppm, drinking a liter of water only provides 1 mg of fluride. It is extremely improbable a person will receive more than the tolerable upper limit from consuming optimally fluoridated water alone. You would have to drink gallons a day for years, before the age of 8. 


Where are these supposed studies that show that fluoridation is harmful? 


Communities themselves decided to fluoridate water supplies due to the substantial public health benefits. Just because *you* don't understand why this was done doesn't mean it is some evil thing that has been forced upon you. Do you complain about how you were forced to attend public schools? How you are forced to accept the help of public police? How that dastardly fire department rushes around and puts out burning buildings without even giving people the freedom to commit arson?

Other economies with deflationary currencies didn't have alternative currencies to compete with. When people needed to choose between spending their limited supply of deflationary currency, which would be worth more later if they saved it, or starving to death, they went with spending the deflationary currency.

No... deflation will turn into a vicious circle of decreasing production and increasing unemployment basically until the economic system completely collapses, if left unchecked. This is what happened at the start of the Great Depression. The reason we haven't seen this happen since then is that governments have typically been very aggressive about stopping deflation, since deflation (in a fiat-money system especially) is both 100% associated with recession and 100% preventable. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:39:52
If merchants are tying their prices to the current USD conversion rate, they are most likely re-selling bitcoins immediately whenever someone uses them to buy something, otherwise they are taking a speculative risk themselves on the price of bitcoins. This may be something you and I are willing to do but in general, companies *do not* want to take speculative risks on currency exchange rates. Even if the risk seems small. It is our of their area of expertise and they are responsible to owners/shareholders who may not approve of taking risks so unrelated to the core business model.

Problem with this: the "energy potential" isn't infinite; it is recyclable.

This is because usually wages are too sticky. It's easier to demand wage increases due to inflation but they usually still lag.

Thanks for the discussion. I'll have to do some reading on Gesell and that stuff. 
One thing I find really odd about the recent bitcoin bubble is that I see so many people talking about "buying into" the market; i.e. buying bitcoins at these pretty high prices hoping they will go up in value. If you want to make money on bitcoins right now and expect them to maintain value, you should be buying some of those new ASICS and mining with them, am i wrong? It's kind of like oil or gold mining, frankly, there is a limited supply, the value could fluctuate wildly, but it is really fucking cheap to mine right now compared to the cost. Mining should be profitable at a small fraction of the current price and anyone buying bitcoins as speculation is making a huge gamble. I feel like once more of these new bitcoin-mining ASICs come online, they will drive the price of bitcoins down.

I don't "subscribe" to an economic school of thought, I judge ideas by whether they are supported by evidence. 
My  problem with Austrians is that they do not, and in fact cannot make quantitative predictions. I've heard self-proclaimed Austrians say that loose money policy will lead to inflation, but I've never seen any of them predict how much inflation we will get from a specific level of interest rates or quantitative easing, not even a ballpark figure. They avoid making statements that can be explicitly disproven. 
Modern economists who actually do research, rather than talking out of their asses, come up with models using equations that you can plug real data into and predict a result. Sometimes they are wrong, but that allows them to examine inaccuracy in the models. Austrians just don't make testable models.

To be brutally honest, no. However we are probably a decade or more away from quantum computers being available enough for anyone to actually bother breaking bitcoin. The only current quantum computers (from D-wave) are not fully programmable; they rely on a certain type of quantum interaction to solve optimization problems and I'm pretty sure they can't (yet) be used to break encryption. At least not any more efficiently than standard digital computers. However, yes, given that we know it is theoretically possible and that there are a lot of researchers (and a lot of money) going towards quantum computers, it's only a matter of time.

This is exactly what will happen. Merchants aren't interested in owning bitcoins. They are interested in selling their products to obtain (dollars/euros/yen/etc). There is still a need to pay taxes, wages, and supplier costs in official currencies. Bitcoins are great for consumers and merchants wishing to make transactions anonymously, but merchants must be able to convert bitcoins into regular currency to pay their expenses. The extreme volatility of bitcoin prices lately is a giant red flag to merchants to not get involved, and ultimately this makes bitcoins *less* valuable.

This is interesting. I have thought for a while that money in modern societies represents a kind of "reputation value", or trust, that substitutes between strangers for the trust and reputation we would otherwise need to build in a community with no money (i.e. hunter-gatherer tribes). Humans are social and could not have successfully evolved without developing social relationships and the ability to figure out who is reliable or not. In primitive human societies, you would actually be able to know the vast majority of people you would ever need to interact with. In modern times (even since ancient civilizations, even) too many people live together to build the kind of mutual relationship you need to know that if you give someone something, you will get something in return. Money is a substitute. 
Bitcoin is the first monetary system where the money itself is trustworthy by design, rather than being backed by commodities (gold) or the force of law.

I would say "some digital currency similar to bitcoin's peer-to-peer network and distributed blockchain but without the natural deflation will have a place."
The problem with bitcoin isn't the way it handles transactions, that part is excellent and should be imitated, the problem is that as a hard-capped money supply, the natural incentive is to save it rather than spend it. Investing with bitcoins is futile. You can't loan them to anyone or give them to anyone in return for future repayment or work to be done- they can just take the bitcoins and disappear. With a naturally deflationary currency, economic growth is restricted for no reason other than poor money supply. An alternative digital currency with built-in money supply corrections to maintain a stable price would be strictly superior to bitcoins. 
Also as to 


I don't have to worry about identity theft with a credit card. I have zero liability protection for fraudulent charges. If someone steals my credit card info all I have to do is call my bank and say "hey someone stole my info and the following purchases are fraudulent" and they will disappear. And most likely, if the fraudulent purchases are valuable enough, they will be caught, arrested and prosecuted for fraud. Bitcoin doesn't offer the same protection for customers. They shoulder all of the risk of electronic theft of their bitcoins.

The fundamental value of the dollar is that the US government demands you pay taxes in dollars; this creates un-avoidable demand for some amount of dollars. The rest of the economy uses dollars because, given that there is some level of unavoidable demand for them, it is most efficient to use them for everything. 
Bitcoin will never be more efficient to use than dollars for generic transactions. No one is going to pay their rent or buy groceries with bitcoins rather than dollars. The scale of the dollar-based economy is simply too big to match. 
The value of bitcoins is for purchases where one or both parties want to remain anonymous. Things that you would otherwise have to use cash for- of course even cash can be traced with the right forensics. This is why it is the ideal currency to purchase drugs with for anyone, or for example, porn for someone who doesn't want it showing up on their credit card. Or if you just don't want anyone to know you have made a particular purchase.

Yes. Austrian Economics (or what is called that by the people who call themselves Austrians, since their claimed intellectual antecedents are long dead) deliberately avoids testable hypothesis. It therefore cannot make meaningful statements. 
From a discussion on another site a while ago: "The Austrian school says that the axioms of human action need no empirical verification. I believe that any methodology that rejects empirical testing of theories is flawed. Once the scientific revolution reached the social sciences, any school of thought that denied the empirical method should have been abandoned just as happened in the physical and biological sciences."
I'm a scientist; specifically a chemist. I have read papers and arguments from "Austrian Economists" and I just see right through their shoddy arguments and half-baked assumptions. They are like meta-physicists arguing over the meaning of Plato's true forms. They contribute nothing of value to the study of economics as a real science that can produce meaningful predictions.

No.... Trust in bitcoins is based on the mathematical difficulty (impossibility) of creating a fake transaction. That's the beauty of them. The problem is, who wants to make purchases with a currency whose value is wildly fluctuating?

obviously they screwed you over but people need to realize THIS WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN. You should NOT trust ANY website with control of your bitcoins. Store them on your own device or sell them to an exchange immediately. Trusting them to a 3rd party is like trusting a random stranger with your (real money) wallet.

But as long as there is competition in the money supply- such as dollars, or a different digital currency- there will be an incentive to use the more inflationary money first. Even if we stopped using any other currency, the deflationary nature of bitcoin means the bitcoin economy is needlessly restricted.

A broken clock is right twice a day. How do you account for the predictions where Austrians were completely wrong? Have they made any predictions, based on their theories, which were not also predicted by other theories? 


Then OF WHAT USE IS IT? I see people using arguments from Austrian Economics to support various economic policies which could have a real and significant impact on the economy. Some of these impacts are negative. Would you make decisions on environmental regulations based on the ideas of flat-earth creationists? Would you make health care decisions based on the advice of a snake-oil salesman? I should hope not. What you call "Keynesian" economics- by the way, that's sort of like calling modern biology "Darwinian Biology" or modern physics "Newtonian Mechanics," grossly misleading people about the amount of real research that has been done for decades- *is* a scientific process. Just because no one is right all of the time doesn't mean they are taking the wrong approach. We still can't predict the weather more than a few days in advance. Analyzing a global economy is on a similar scale of difficulty. However we do have a pretty good understanding of what causes major trends in both the weather and the economy, thanks to continuous improvement of our data collection and ability to analyze it and model it quantitatively. 
Austrian Economics doesn't pretend to be a science, I agree, but it does attempt to influence policy as if it carried the intellectual credibility of a science. This is what I have a problem with.

Odd because to me it seems like bitcoins are immensely useful as a medium of exchange, but terrible as a store of value.
Bitcoins are perfect for a certain type of transaction: those which are done anonymously. If you need to buy something without the transaction being traceable, you must use cash (which isn't perfectly untraceable, and requires physical presence with the counterparty) or now, bitcoins. Given that there are several competing bitcoin exchanges, and more might pop up in the future, it seems likely that the cost of exchanging bitcoins for dollars (or euros, etc) will remain small. It seems to me that the lowest-risk method of using bitcoins is to buy them on an exchange shortly before you need to use them to make an anonymous purchase. Storing your bitcoins isn't really that hard, but storing a relatively large value becomes more costly than just paying a small transaction fee to an exchange whenver you need some. Since you risk losing your bitcoins to hacking, or hardware failure, or theft of your bitcoin wallet, etc, there is a pretty substantial cost to storing a large value of bitcoins for a period of time, either the risk of losing them, or the cost of having robust security and backup. 
For the same reason, bitcoins are terrible as a story of value. It's like keeping your cash under the mattress. It is not useful for anything other than as money; hell even cash can be burnt if you are freezing to death. Gold is a good store of value because it is portable and durable, and has industrially and culturally important uses. Bitcoins are *only* useful as a medium of exchange. 
Bitcoins are potentially a decent investment, but you might as well go to vegas and play the slots. You'll have more fun and are just as likely to come out ahead.

They were both contemporary authors of rather fantastic science fiction with (quite opposite) political attitudes consistently appearing throughout their books? Also both had a Russian Jewish heritage, which makes the contrast even more interesting.

Agreed, what really hurts my brain is that I first learned about bitcoins very early on (when a single gpu could mine dozens-hundreds a month at least) and thought "oh that's silly no one will use those for anything"
