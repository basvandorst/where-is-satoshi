I'm making one for the waste management industry. I call it Bitcoin Trash.

Great Sinterklaas gift indeed. Though I wouldn't have mind some Bitcoin in my shoe this year.

1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi or 1,000,000 bits!

When buying Bitcoin on a weekly/monthly basis, put the same amount of money you invested into it in a savings account. Keep doing this while the price of Bitcoin is rising.
Keep buying when the price of Bitcoin starts dropping (or is lower than the last time you bought), but double the amount of money you put in by using the money you put away in your savings account.
When the price starts zooming up again you go back to the initial weekly/monthly amount.
So as an example, if you invest $50 a week, throw an extra $50 in your savings account. When the price of Bitcoin starts dropping, use your savings account to double down your weekly investments to make it $100. When the price starts going up, you go back to 50/50.
I have been doing this for a while for my newborn's 'Bitcoin account' and that way the price swings don't hurt either way they go.

You could try to involve your parents. 
Explain to them why you think Bitcoin is a good investment right now and work out a plan on how they can support you.

Haha, same feeling here my friend.

Shout out to [Stichting Ambulancewens]( *(Ambulance Wish Foundation)*.
This is a Dutch non-profit organisation *(also do work in Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Israel and Sweden)* that grants wishes to terminal *(non-mobile)* people and their families. 
These kind souls granted a wish for my mother last year *(only a few weeks before she past away)* and I will take any opportunity to spread the word of the awesome work they do. My mother had cancer and was unable to move after she broke her leg and pelvis after falling *(her bones had become too brittle)*. Stichting Ambulancewens granted her wish to have one last day out with her family *(my sisters, her husband and myself)*. Two awesome volunteers came to pick her up with the ambulance and gave her one last fantastic day out in the open air with the people she loved. Due to her complications this would not have been possible without them.
My mother was so touched by their work, that she wanted people to donate money to Stichting Ambulancewens, instead of buying flowers for her funeral.
This is a relatively small foundation and any form/amount of donations has a huge inpact on it and the people they help. They are 100% volunteers and put all the donation money towards stuff like new equipment (such as second hand ambulances) and the wishes of the people.

Did some transactions yesterday for similar amounts and all went through within 10 minutes or so. So I'm not sure what went wrong on your side.

You're not missing out. No worries.

In 3 years? My bet would be around $80k.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:57:01
Probably altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:05:52
Do you mind if I use that to make some posters, stickers or whatnot?

Buy $250 worth of Bitcoin now and $250 every next week. This way you'll avarage it down/up.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:23:03
Dang. That is like 450 future Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:28:12
Google "It's over 9000!"

Roger Ver just ragequit the convo. But you can still watch the entire discussion on the YouTube channel.
Some parts are pretty informative and entertaining in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:01:57
I don't have much to add to all these comments. I just hope that you will put the BTC that you are unable to refund towards a good cause.
It is too much money for one single person to have. Many good things can be done with it.
Best of luck with everything going on.

He means 'halving', or the event people often call 'the halvening'. Google for more info.
