Great site with a whimsical approach...hope your prediction is correct!

Same thing here...I have a friend who keeps telling me to peel a little off (since $1000)...he's a great guy, retired at 40, but the unsolicited financial advice gets a bit old.

Well, this is a breath of fresh air. For once, a well-established academic in the fin/econ sector offers an open-minded approach to cryptocurrency without playing into the obvious contrarian sentiment of either the host or his colleagues.

Will installing something like the 'no coin' extension in Chrome prevent stuff like this?
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:46:34
No...we can’t even break, let alone hold $10k....there’s no catalyst on the horizon (apart from the hearsay that ‘big money’ is going to enter the space). The hype died around the time you bought...it may return, but not until something major and newsworthy occurs...perhaps lightning. Despite the Tom Lee, McAfee, Draper moon predictions, nobody knows what the price will do...including me and everyone else.

We got free BCH, sold it for BTC...that transaction is a BTC purchase. When people are buying any scarce commodity at a fast pace, the price rises, because demand &gt; supply.

LPT: When you see stuff like this, reach out to the company's support staff so their lawyers can get it taken down asap.

Hey, that's not bad. Every trader goes through this...if I had a dollar for every time I exited a trade too early, I'd have a lot more dollars. :-)
Nobody ever went broke by taking a profit...you made a successful trade and earned a good stack of money for doing little more than clicking a couple buttons.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:03:49
Yes, you are automatically holding both (unless you're holding on an exchange like Poloniex or Coinbase, who won't credit your account with the BCH for a while).
There a few ways to sell, but the easiest way is probably to use a Trezor or Ledger...you can split the coins inside there, then send the BCH to an exchange like Bittrex and sell as soon as your deposit is confirmed.
Yes, BTC is the original and BCH is the fork.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:49:17
I think the transaction times are the problem...cash and credit cards work fine for quick, everyday purchases. Unless BTC can process much, much, faster, it's going to be years before we see mass adoption.
So a 10min BTC confirmation is fine for a major purchase, and double spending for a pack of gum is a low level risk for a merchant, but when I'm buying $200 in groceries, $65 in gas, or a $2000 Mac, nobody wants to stand around and wait for a confirmation before being able to leave the store with their purchase.

Dude, that's awesome, and so is Penang! Can you imagine if all the hawker stalls and kopitiams started accepting BTC?

I can't speak to where he got his numbers, and I think you would do well to not focus too much on the speculative stuff that gets thrown around here. That said, check out Banking on Bitcoin On Netflix for a good intro to the history of Bitcoin.
To actually start investing, my best advice is to just start doing it. Open up an account on Coinbase or Gemini and start buying there.
There's a great sub Reddit for people who are just getting into this area over at r/bitcoinbeginners

You don't need to declare anything. You can hodl both BTC and BCH if you want, but I think a lot of people held BTC and dumped BCH as fast as possible because they saw the market wasn't interested in it.
If you don't need the money, I think the wise thing is to hodl. 
Every crypto exchange supports BTC, mate.

An IRA is a pre tax investment that reduces your federal income tax burden. So while you pay tax when you retire, it will likely be at a lower rate than when you would pay now, while employed.
So the fee for getting in may be worthwhile depending on your financial situation.

Could you elaborate?

Let's get to $10k first
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:00:52
Yep...just a theory. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:51:50
Relax, you'll probably get another opportunity to buy when we invent some other FUD to obsess about in the next week. 
You probably sold in the 2800's, so not too shabby...at least you didn't sell a couple weeks ago when everyone first started freaking out for no reason at all.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:37:28
OP, look up foreign earned income exclusion...that's the tax break he's referring to.

I went with Bittrex...confirmations took like 16hrs before I could finally unload them though, so if you haven't shifted them yet, do so asap.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:33:00
Why do you assume that it is the miners who are dumping now? Couldn't it just as easily be the Koreans?
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:33:45
Asia waking up and selling their BCH, which adds huge volume to BTC, pushing up the price? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:46:57
I quit checking this sub and blockfolio at that time...you get used to it after a few of these hiccups, but it is never pleasant. Better to not torture yourself. :-)

So much for holding 4k...nice to see you again, Bart.

Amazing...There was a story on here a few weeks ago where a guy was traveling in Penang, Malaysia (btw if you haven't been, you need to go!) and helped some roadside seller get into bitcoin by showing him how to download Breadwallet. Wonder if it is catching on?

At the risk of sounding more like something that would be posted to r/that happened...
Last night, my wife, who is not really that into ilistening to me ramble on about bitcoin or crypto currencies, saw the dip announced on her Google news feed. 
She said "looks like bitcoin went down" and I said "yeah, China is trying to regulate everything and people are freaking out."
She then said "maybe it's a good time to buy more"
It was pretty cool hearing somebody from outside the community also recognize this as an amazing opportunity.

It means to live at the same level as your neighbors/friends. So if others are driving a BMW, you should drive one too...if they are going on nice holidays, so should you, etc. In this way, you are keeping up with the Joneses (or whatever surname is common in your country).

Thank you...I'm so weary of these bro-bloggers who have no interest in doing actual research. The Rothschild myth is particularly hard to dispel because it feeds so conveniently into the 'muh lamboz' narrative. Hey, anything for those clicks, right?
