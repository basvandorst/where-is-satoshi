@_date: 2019-12-26 01:21:41

@_date: 2019-12-26 00:49:48
Exactly. How long have you been trading ?
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:30:14
You are entitled to your own opinion...
I'm sad you feel this way
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:12:40

1807 ? ...
Would you be alive to enjoy your investment ?
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:04:07
Come to think of it I guess you are right.. hits like a Ponzi scheme. The last ones to get in suffers the loss
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:57:21
You have a point though...
But then we are talking about the significance of both currencies in todays market
@_date: 2019-12-27 01:27:33
So many people scared to take a fall ..
But oh well I won't blame them ?
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:15:02
Must you be an animal ? ����
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:18:38
However volatile it is, bitcoin is promising and in years to come would be the most common means of payment ... And about the  crystal ball thing, I think I do possess one.
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:33:40
What makes you think so man
@_date: 2019-12-27 01:16:25

@_date: 2019-12-27 01:05:37
Lol ... You believe BTC is finally crashing ?
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:55:34
The chances are slim at the current rate in it's growth
@_date: 2019-12-28 19:03:07
For good to be recognized, evil must be present ...
@_date: 2019-12-26 02:20:02
Lol I guess it did ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:47:12
I understand what you are saying man I do ..but then the message here is simply that bitcoin is a better investment than gold ..
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:27:05
It's lack of understanding...
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:50:25
I think he'll understand better now.. thanks ✌��
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:44:33
There will always be extremist ������.
I personally put up this post cos it has an element of truth and at the same time funny in a hurtful manner.
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:44:47
Man it's useless
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:17:00
Exactly.. when there's an upgrade ..the older version tries to dissuade people from using it so they don't lose their market value
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:58:41
Let's just watch... Been studying the crypto market for a while now and the signs are promising
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:08:56
Finally !!! Someone gets my point....
Get this man a cold beer
