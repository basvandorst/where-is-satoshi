Interesting point! Okay man I'm gonna make it happen! I'll post a new thread when I get all three of our restaurants setup with it. For reference, my family owns Mickey's Deli (Hermosa Beach, CA), Buona Vita (Hermosa Beach, CA), and Paisano's Pizza (Hermosa Beach, CA)
Hopefully within a week or two we will accept BTC!
EDIT: As a side note, we probably won't have a fee during the initial 1m phase.

lol do you know what rhetorical questions are? It was just a way to add a comment :P

Dang, even though the 1m initially waived fee is nice, my payment processor only charges me a flat fee of 50 cents per credit / debit transaction. It's not a huge difference, but seems like the fee is higher (in respect to our business) using Coinbase.
That being said, seems like an interesting deal and it really isn't that bad. If someone spends 150$ at your restaurant, you are spending 1.50$ instead of 0.50$ (again, not a huge difference)

Thanks. I'll take a better look.
Does Coinbase (or bitpay) offer a terminal allowing easy payment? (kind of like swiping a card) How do I convince my customers to use bitcoin in realtime?

How is this not at the top?

Ah! Interesting!
So lets say I own a restaurant. If I want to take bitcoin as payment, will Coinbase guarentee me the exchange rate I need? (if I need 5 bucks for a sandwich, will I get 5 bucks for that sandwich?)
Also, how do these payment processors make a profit? Small transaction fees?

Is it really necessary to publish this person's name etc?
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:07:00
Hmm care to elaborate?
