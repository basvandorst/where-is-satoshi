Would these invalid blocks be transmitted to other nodes before the node crashed, or would an attacker actively have to craft a malicious block and then also send it individually to each node they wanted to crash?
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:28:42






No, it's not possible, still needs to confirm. I hope it works as CPFP (child pays for parent) too which allows a higher tx fee to get the miner to confirm the previous unconfirmed transaction sooner.  That would just speed up confirmation for the lightning channel opening particularly for stuck transactions.

Of course not, running a node should always be encouraged... but if you live in say rural India on the average income of $139 per month, you probably don't have the bandwidth or money to run a VPS. Or the skills.

It is a misconception to compare confirmations in blocks, because of the additional difficulty, one block in bitcoin is far more confirmed than 20 ethereum blocks. It is measured as a product of time and hash power.

I think you're being a bit overly finicky there. Even checking two independently operated block explorers would offer an incredible level of confidence you've received funds. No node required. Don't get me wrong, running nodes is to be encouraged but we need to be realistic that not everyone has the resources or skillset to run a node.

All commitment tx's could be stored in a seperate blockspace (discardable in future, like witness data), and instead of adding a fee all commitments could contain a hash which meets a minimum level of difficulty to prevent spam, might take a couple of minutes to generate for end user but a small cost to be able to keep your keys safe from attack.

You're wrong. I only increase the growth in transactions by 86%, not the entire blockchain (which would massively skew the numbers even higher.

By requiring that the node verifies a random quantity of other people's work each block - they must leave a huge buffer of available capacity - as failing to perform a large verification when 'their turn' will incur a greater economic cost.
It has the same security of PoW, but uses less electricity as the hardware can not be at 100% all the time.
It also means lots of nodes are validating the blockchain.

Bitcoin blockchain size in 2010: 10**MB**
Bitcoin blockchain size in 2013: 13.5GB

Possible with 8MB blocks:
Bitcoin blockchain size in 2019: 1.2TB
From then with 64MB blocks: 
Bitcoin blockchain size in 2022: 11.2TB
Assuming same fall in prices as 2010-2016 for 2016-2022 = $0.004 per GB.
Cost of 96GB in 2016 = $1.82
Cost of 11.2TB in 2022 = $44.83
Relative cost increase over 6 years: 2400%.
Assuming similar growth over 6 years intervals:
Cost of storage in 2028: $1104

By handing control solely to miners, you end up with a situation where only the current miners get their voice heard. All Bitcoin has been generated by miners, some as long as 7 years ago.
When you vote with coins rather than recently mined blocks, you are enabling the entire economic history of Bitcoin to participate, rather than just the current miners.

It would be gameable by a 51% attack (51% of hashpower refereeing maliciously). Except this 51% attack would actually be completely verifiable - and if any blocks are mined which are proveably invalid (i.e. 51% voted maliciously) the blockchain can fork.




I've not seen any proof of activity mechanism that works like this, there may be similar idea out there though, keen to be pointed towards any.
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:13:01
Capacity doesn't decrease, the rate at which it gets cheaper does.
In theory cost of storage should not be connected to demand. Unless that cost starts to impede on the usefulness of the network.

Any particular implementation? It was heavily improvised, I'd be keen to read more on related ideas, I've not encountered any with a similar mechanism.
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:51:49
I just realised, this mechanism could technically be used to completely replace PoW itself and eliminate miner centralisation.
It operates like a hybrid PoW/PoS system and gets the 'best' features of both - un-gamable as still PoW, but also less wasteful as the random validation of other work means that work must be performed at far less than 100%, unlike ASICs.
This could yield big electrical and environmental savings.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:59:58
I agree, we need to scale off chain. This is just an objective demonstration of the facts as they stand fir those who think we could scale to global volume on chain.
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:37:46
Interesting idea.
Makes me think, could we introduce a specification for miners to point towards an address in the coinbase for direct submissions. i.e. d=minerdomain.com;
We could then have a standard where a DNS lookup for the subdomain directdonation.minerdomain.com could provide an IP address to submit transactions to that miner directly.
We could also allow transactions submitted with a no relay flag to these IPs, so that only approved miners who are submitted a transaction can include them in a block.
I have my concerns over using this for signalling, but as a general method of giving users choice over who mines (and doesn't) their transactions it could have value and make miners more like a business trying to win our custom as in the free market.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:05:17
I'm making many assumptions to show the effects of compound interest, which is effectively happens to the blockchain with block size increasing.
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:37:15
I believe that we won't see this happen thanks to LN and Sidechains, but there are many who believe on chain scaling in this way is viable. This just demonstrates the economics of running a node assuming consistent growth. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:39:44
But the chain you describe is chaos with miners stealing everyone's money. This would completely undermine credibility in the chain. Why would any rational economic actor 'want' to participate in such a chain? Even those originally opposed to segWit would recognise that such a hard fork would be bad.
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:06:04
It's a hell of a leap to go from protesting to segwit pre-activation, to supporting a hard fork that completely breaks and devalues bitcoin, supports miner theft and all in the name of spite?
They should be aware that in any rational interpretation of events this does not even feature as a possibility. However disingenuous or uninformed concern trolls will try and play it off as a risk. I'm not sure whether you believe this is a risk, or just want to pretend its a possibility.

@_date: 2017-03-06 23:33:36


It depends entirely on how the UASF is coded. If it's coded to reject any non-SegWit blocks after the activation point then any block produced by non-upgraded miners will be rejected.
SegWit blocks are easily distinguished from non-upgraded blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:21:12
Except you need a miner to include it in a block, which would fork them off the network and they have zero incentive to do.

Mempool is a market, so nodes could start ignoring txs that are below an unreasonable fee threshold (they already can do this). Mempool being full is never a technical issue, it just makes the system a lot slower/more expensive  and requires a suitable fee.

All participants are verifying eachothers work. If someone takes the economic risk of accusing another of cheating then EVERYONE should verify that for themselves. The refereeing process is just a way to trustlessly determine on the blockchain whether the accusation was valid.
Miners do not need to validate everything, but they have an incentive to validate for themselves in this instance as if they don't they risk creating invalid blocks. This mechanism keeps all participants honest, as requiring the network all validate a something incurs an economic cost if not legitimate.
@_date: 2017-02-04 08:30:10
I excluded the first 3 years of bitcoin and used the average growth from where it levels out. Your point about s curves is correct but it depends on what time line. I believe Bitcoin could achieve this rate of growth for 20 years before it starts the slow down, though I don't think on chain is where it will happen. This is just to demonstrate what would be required for that.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:20:26
UASF is much less contentious, it is a soft rather than hard fork and will either fail or succeed and then we move on. EG creates an ongoing contentious hard fork risk environment.
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:26:03
But the miners have zero incentive to fork bitcoin in this way, as the theft chain would be rejected and they'd have wasted all their resources.

I'm fortunate to have enough technical knowhow to create a transaction without relying on a wallet. I'd transfer my coins to an address I control and hope that it transferred on one chain and not the other (replay attack).

That's a massive gamble. In order to move those coins you'll have to spend huge fees and will eventually run out. If that chain wins as the economic majority you've lost big time.
You are welcome to attempt such strategy. Ironically the huge fees serve as extra incentive for miners to operate on that chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:31:51

This is the issue, you demonstrate you don't understand the problem, and then offer an opinion which those that do have dismissed. I also favour raising the blocksize and have even proposed a dynamic block size increase on the developer mailing list, but a dynamic increase without limits as you describe is dangerous, and Moore's law is not relevant at all.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:36:18
It would be incredibly difficult to exist side by side, there would be lots of replay attacks.
The SegWit side of the fork would have a huge advantage in this regard, as SegWit transactions would only occur on the SegWit chain and so could be used safely. This alone might hugely disincentivise use of the other side of the fork, as SegWit chain would be the safer option.
You'll have to run different node software/block explorers to keep track of each chain.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:28:03


I don't think this is right. The whole point of UASF is that non-upgraded miners produce blocks that are invalid to upgraded nodes. Not upgrading would mean that all that miners' blocks were invalid to UASF nodes, but they could still build on top of a solitary SegWit block (there would never be a second as no SegWit nodes would mine on top of that chain).
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:28:17
If a POW change was in response to an attack it would be very quick, and any miner with existing hardware would be affected equally. If there was a succesful change of POW their hardware would be useless for Bitcoin, if there was 1 addition it would be worth 50%, 2 additions 33% and so on.
Success could lead to more confidence in Bitcoin causing price to increase which may mitigate some of the loss, but contentious hard fork could also cause a fall in value.

There are many 'small blockers' who favour a blocksize increase beyond 1MB with consensus, but are fundamentally opposed to untested miner power grab nonsense like 'emergent consensus'.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:55:07
90% hashpower against UASF would of course result in a split. Any hashpower against UASF (old software only) in the 51%-99.9% range would create a split.
If that happened the economic majority chain (determined by market price at exchanges) would soon win, as it would be incredibly expensive to mine on a chain that has no economic value even if it has a far higher hash power.
And once miners move over towards the UASF chain and 51% of hash power is there, the split is over.
It would be very unlikely two forks could be sustained if the economic majority followed the UASF chain. Miners would have to act incredibly irrationally and inflict huge cost on themselves to attempt to sustain it.... for no real benefit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:24:12

Once the hardware stops rapidly advancing the advantage of running the latest hardware is massively reduced. Right now I use a laptop manufactured in 2011 and it works great. If I used a PC manufactured in 1996 in 2002 it would have been a radically different performance.
When hardware stops becoming so quickly obsolete it means many more people can access it over time, it becomes cheaper and eventually if enough people have access to it the activity of mining itself loses profitability if enough people do it just to secure the network - as satoshi imagined it may work with CPUs

99% of miners could mine BU. If the economic majority didn't support it they'd all be mining a worthless alternative at huge expense. They would very quickly want to switch back, the longer they wait the more they lose. They'd have to seriously hold their nerve. The existing chain can patiently wait out such a scenario if it has the economic majority, the miners would have no real choice but to return and probably quite quickly once the price for the fork had been established in the markets.
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:39:51
Interesting, thanks for correcting me!
If UASF isn't designed to require SegWit compatible blocks only, this makes a 51% attack of hashpower to orphan SegWit blocks and face no economic risk and shifts the risk to those creating SegWit compatible blocks. I think this will seriously neuter the power of a UASF, and I think we should consider implementing them more aggressively.

You are massively wrong, and your own ignorance hasn't done much to correct that.

What makes you think he is going to get concessions? Changing the POW has gone from almost unthinkable to a distinct possibility thanks to the hostility he alone has shown, he has more likely done far more harm to his interests than he realises with nothing to show for it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:34:32
I'm not aware of any serious suggestion of a POW addition or change that isn't to protect the network from some hostile act or risk, that would be unlikely to gain any support.
I personally would favour the threat of a self-activating change/addition of POW in the event of a contentious fork to disincentivise such an action and keep miners honest, but I can only speak for myself.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:15:01
What is being described is clogging up the small block chain, which would be expensive and require payment of fees to miners on that chain.

Upvoted for visibility. There is, I believe, enough appetite for a hard fork after SegWit, but there will be no consensus for a hard fork until the easy, safe and rapid to deploy SegWit has been activated.

They can fork the network however they like and attack the other side of the fork.
They couldn't make anybody run their fork, but unless the POW is changed they can make it so the other side of the fork isn't functional either in an attempt to force people to use their fork.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:09:09
It's about as well tested as BU. It breaks consensus, by what measure is it the 'right' approach?

They could mine only empty blocks so it is completely useless.
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:09:59
It's not the same as a hard fork.
It's true that if 51% of miners refused to follow the network would fork, but if they don't it's a normal soft fork.
Its different from a hard fork because it only becomes a fork if it fails, whereas a hard fork is always a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:33:36

Except Bitcoin isn't a centrally owned car. It is a distributed network governed by rules. If something is within the rules and the community hasn't tightened them up (as segwit would allow) then these things are going to happen.

This doesn't offer anything that different or new from existing PoS implantations. PoS is naturally centralising over time, while there is reason to believe PoW will decentralise over time. There are also huge consensus issues and the nothing at stake problem where rival versions of a blockchain can be created and new Nodes cannot determine which is "real". Ethereum is attempting to solve these problems but the complexity is phononenal, and just creates a bunch of new problems. POS can always be gamed in some way, it's a waste of time, the perpetual motion machine of cryptocurrency.

You're very brave. They might be trying to push down the price so they can buy lots of cheap coins, and then all start signalling to end the impasse. They gain, people like you lose.
The real way to pressure the miners is the looming threat that if they don't play ball the economic would be willing to a change of POW.

It's possible to use vanity addresses to signal support. I wrote about the idea on the bitcoin-dev mailing list in Feb: 
It would definitely work, is on chain, doesn't require any change to the protocol, and is uncheatable and safe. You'd basically generate and address that signals your support for something and transfer your coins to it.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:43:03
It is physically impossible as you could always sybil attack - which as you describe there would be no way to differentiate.
It may be possible to change to a PoW that could require individual proofs that cannot be calculated in parallel (pooled), but this would be far more complicated to develop, administer and a radical change to how Bitcoin operates.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:11:50


@_date: 2017-02-08 15:34:23
An asymmetric PoW can be used with this method.


This idea basically makes verifying other nodes' proof of work part of the proof of work itself.
Every node can only sign one proof per block - if they try to create multiple proofs (to spam) they can be punished and incur an economic cost (loss of deposit and participation). Nodes will disregard excessive proofs.
In terms of skipping validation - the 'challenges' that are created with a proof are known to the proof creator. If a node tries to skip validation they will get the challenges wrong, the person who created the proof (and possibly other validating nodes) will see this and be able to challenge the proof - so skipping validation will be caught and punished.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:57:59
It's a symbiotic balance between miners and users.
If an economic majority of users want to run software that changes the rules, that's their right, not an attack.
An economic majority is far more powerful and important than a hashpower majority.

It needs to be possible for timestamps to be out of order for protocol purposes otherwise it could run/be manipulated too fast with no way to correct it
@_date: 2017-03-06 15:12:00
It would require a minimum of 51% of miners to mine *against* the UASF.
ETC/ETH was able to split with 10/90 split. Not the same likelihood at all. Very unlikely to fail for something like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:49:22
You're highlighting your lack of understanding. A soft fork can split the network too. The difference between hard and soft is whether new blocks are backwards compatible with old clients, if miners are not in consensus on soft forks there has always been a risk of splitting.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:12:21
Fair, but I am intrigued to what other meetups are like.
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:23:29
That is true of soft forks though. Miners that don't upgrade get forked off by the other miners, that's literally what soft forks are and how they are implemented.
100% of miners must ALWAYS upgrade their software for any soft fork. It is only regular nodes for whom soft forks are backwards compatible.

I agree, I don't think we'll scale on chain like this, but part of the community argues we can.
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:13:43


Luke, you have so much to offer the Bitcoin community, but sometimes you undermine your own credibility and its a shame.
Your arguement here is not objective, there is a very reasonable case to be made that this is a legitimate use of the blockchain since the transactions are being paid for. There is also a legitimate case that this is not a good use of blockspace. You could make the latter case far more effectively, talking about reporting to the crime agencies probably does more harm than good to your cause.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:40:52
They do, it's just that a new block is determined by its depth, not by its timestamp. I don't think there is any way to force timestamp order without introducing this issue that the time cannot be corrected and will drift.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:43:11
I agree, but it would feel good to show them who has the real power.
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:22:20
Yeah, it creates a split. But it's still a soft fork since if the segwit chain overtook the non segwit chain the old clients will follow. In a hard fork that is impossible.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:57:58
You're so wrong. Hashpower will always ultimately follow the economic majority.
If they want to keep mining on a fork that the economic majority doesn;t support they will waste a LOT of money before realising the error of their ways.
It is a complete misunderstanding to think the miners can call the shots, I mean they can, but only if a majority of them have not only the desire, but very deep pockets and a nerve of steel.

The Core developers should not have to include a feature they think is dangerous just because of a small part of the community makes a lot of noise.

@_date: 2017-01-11 09:27:59
When I originally proposed the idea miners could vote two rates of increase, staying the same, and decreasing the block size.
I am now of the belief that permitting miners to vote to decrease the blocksize could, while unlikely, result in them to shrink it purely to increase fee margins. The theory is more capacity = more people use Bitcoin = Bitcoins more valuable. However that requires *bigger picture* thinking, whereas miners are incentivised more short term.
I think the same idea without allowing miners to decrease the block size could work - since even if miners refuse to ever increase it we're no worse off than we are under the current system.
On the concern of pools passing fees to themselves - they would have to find consecutive blocks. If they withheld a block from the blockchain to start working on a second block they risk orphaning the block they already have at a huge economic cost. Its in their interests to relay new blocks as soon as possible.

What about the part of the community who think SegWit was the better option for the developers to prioritise?
Your argument seems to be that the developers invested their time and resources into the solution you didn't want, so you want to block its implementation.
What is your end game in blocking SegWit? To me, it just seems like a standoff which delays all progress. It's very hard to gain consensus on a blocksize increase when so much of the community would like to see SegWit.

Yielding to such obstructionism would set a dangerous precedent that every other innovation could be treated in exactly the same way.
I and many other members of the community would rather hold tight than set such a precedent.

I think it could be considered a centralization risk, even though channel monitors cannot know your transactions..
I mean, sure. But that's like saying Bitcoin can never be completely secure because any hardware that stores your private key could simultaneously break and any paper wallets could burn in a fire, and you could get dementia if you use a brain wallet.
There is ALWAYS a risk by definition. Monitoring the blockchain 24/7 isn't beyond most people, if their internet cuts out for an hour, its no big deal.
You set a timelock - you could make it a few days. So it doesn't matter if you're not monitoring 24/7, as long as you are re-connected and spot it before the timelock expires. If you're particularly nervous of going offline set a longer timelock.
Having a private key is a technically a risk no matter what you do, as is stealing transactions. However you can control these risks.

Miners are given block rewards and fees. Users give these value. If miners want to mine a private chain, that is their prerogative.
Hashrate follows the value of a blockchain, not the other way around (except temporarily if a miner has very deep pockets for purposes of ideology or malice).

For perspective, if you bought $10,000 bitcoin on highest price day in 2011 (9 June), you still wouldn't have $1m worth now.
If you bought on the highest price day of 2010 (Nov 6), just $150 would make you a millionaire now. On 26 July 2010 $150 would make you now worth $8m.

The bins are like blocks. At the moment we have 1 block of 1mb which is full. Seg wit means we have 2 bins (bocks) which store different parts of transactions. 
Some people argue that segwit isn't a capacity increase because we still only have a 1mb block size, but we have an extra block to store data so they are wrong and it is a capacity increase. Much like recycling is better and more sustainable, separating transaction and witness data also has benefits.

I apologise, I hadn't read it in a few months and did not recall that line. You are right.
I think rbtc is toxic, I am a Core roadmap supporter.
I do however think it would be not in the spirit of the agreement for the Core developers to renege on providing the said code on the basis of a small number of dissenting miners who probably weren't ever that serious about the agreement.
That's allowing the actions of the few to derail the many. However I concede that a legitimate case can be made that those developers are not bound to carry out their side, I really hope they do as otherwise it will give the big blockers easy ammunition.

Bitcoin has never had a block above 1mb.as blocks got bigger it becomes harder to run a node. I've been around long enough to remember when most people ran a node, I ran one on my laptop and the blockchain was 2GB. Now my laptop has SSD and not enough space, and running an node is so consuming my Internet slows down. We've already seen a fall in accessibility of decentralisation as block size grew. Bitcoin can never be decentralised if we scale to something like Visa on chain. I've been following this thing for over 5 years, you sound like you haven't been around anywhere near that long.

It depends on when in 2011 and how much you bought.
Buying was a lot riskier back then. I had to deposit into the bank account of an exchange that kept getting its accounts shut down. I had no idea whether I would get any Bitcoin for my deposit, so I bought a LOT less than I originally planned to. I still had to chase my deposit with a random guy on Skype. Even if I had the courage to buy as much as I originally planned I wouldn't be a Bitcoin millionaire now.
I think you have to go to 2010 for most buyers that held to be millionaires now.
Most people who held are likely those that read the whitepaper and had a lightbulb moment. These are the minority, the vast majority of people see the price double and they get excited and want to cash out. Especially people who bought for the purpose of transacting on the dark web.

The problem is bandwidth as much as storage - since they can be pruned on the fly, the entire blockchain from Genesis downloaded on every new node in order to validate the pruning without trusting a third party. Sharding\torrenting would help though, definitely.

Pruning is great, but pruned nodes are not full network participants and they cannot relay old blocks. The network NEEDS unpruned nodes in order to survive.
You also still need to download the entire blockchain in order to begin pruning, though this is done on the fly.

My SSD is 120GB and hosting a node does slow my streaming down. That is undisputable fact.
Doubling the block size will double the demand on hard drive space and bandwidth. That is fact also.
That said, I am in favour of increasing the block size - personally I'd hard fork an increase right after SegWit (as is the plan), the block size needs to increase. It just needs to be politically very hard to increase and not determined by one group, such as miners. We can't allow a situation where the block size is allowed to grow unrestrained as very soon you wont be running it on your 500GB SSD or your home connection... and nodes will become centralised, and the thing that makes Bitcoin valuable will be eroded.
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:09:03
I felt I made my point. I'd add that when bankers were given the opportunity (either through lack of regulation, or lack of enforcement) they jeopardised the entire system for their short term gains.

You're right, it's confusing when we talk about two things, decentralisation of development and decentralisation of the protocol.
I agree with nullc that its best for bitcoin that we should only have one implementation.
However holding that view does not mean other implementations are 'banned', there is no implied centralisation or conflict from this position.
If somebody thinks the direction of Core is the wrong one and wants to re-write it in a different language, or fork the protocol that is their right... they just have to persuade the economic majority and get enough people to do it safely.
A change of reference client should be approached like (and probably combined with) a hard fork. Multiple clients is bad for consensus.
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:24:07
It doesn't, this is a problem for any fork with the same proof of work.
This is merely a mechanism for users to reward miners in the event of such a hard fork. Possibly combined with an additional proof of work if the users wanted to hurt all miners and limit impact of attacks on chain. This could provide a mechanism to transition between proof of work in the event of a HF. The threat could be used to put pressure on miners to signal along with the interests of the users.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:21:16




Decentralised != a group of developers with different opinions
Decentralised means if developers hold a position not held by their peers they are free to take the code and create their own implementation that everybody is free to use.
The fact that this has been attempted (BU, Classic, XT) and those teams failed to gain support from the decentralised user base is decentralised development in action.
Decentralised development doesn't mean a minority of development consensus being slipped into the project for the sake of everyone getting their say. Mutually exclusive opinions cannot be accommodated in software.
This has nothing to do with decentralisation.

Terrible analogy.
If your trash can is full, you might request a bigger trashcan.
If instead of a bigger trashcan you get a second trashcan that can take half the waste, you still get the same result - higher capacity.
Yes, technically you didn't get a bigger trashcan, you get a second one - but the end result is the same your capacity increased, and it's disingenuous semantics to argue otherwise.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:46:15

Yes, SegWit will likely boost tps by around 2x.
Block size is being increased (a new extra bit of space is being created in addition to the existing 1MB).
The outcome is a capacity increase by every metric if people choose to use SegWit transactions - which they are incentivised to do.


Again, block size is semantics. It is being increased, just not in the way non-technical people can easily comprehend which leads to these silly misunderstandings and leaves them vulnerable to malicious propaganda.
If your trashcan is full, and you get a second trashcan, you can't really complain that your original trashcan didn't get bigger as you still increased your capacity, if not your trash can size.
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:15:34

Why? Imagine a 'perfect' POW, defying the laws of physics.
If access to hardware was equal, the cost of electricity is geographical. This gives an advantage which creates a natural tendency towards geographic centralisation.
If electricity were zero cost for all participants, this would be a 'better' POW in terms of decentralisation?
At its other extreme, imagine mining hardware was infinite supply and free, and electricity was the only cost.
This scenario would create perfectly centralised mining wherever electricity is cheapest.
That is why I believe anything that lowers the cost of electricity in relation to hardware is desirable.


Hashing against blockchain data would be one way!

Forking to increase the block size is really easy, persuading people to use your fork is the problem. That's why it hasn't happened, big blockers haven't been brave enough because they know the economic majority isn't with them otherwise they would have just forked already.

@_date: 2017-04-19 14:57:38
I described in an ideal world.
Despite that I also believe both could be possible.
It would require a radical change to the POW, but a cumulative POW (hashing sequentially to produce a single result) could not be distributed between different hardware at all. That way each miner would produce just one proof per block (rather than trillions). Validating other miners' historical unique proofs could become part of the POW itself. This mechanism could be combined with a security bond to disincentivise cheating and massively increase the cost and risk of botnet.

Sharing is like having lots of layer ones. The problem with that is all the layer ones struggling to communicate with each other. They still have to be managed by one super layer that has a huge administrative overhead and centralising pressure. Most shard models depend on proof of stake which offers worse security and will always tend towards centralisation. It could be done with proof of work but the security would be diluted between shards. Security tradeoffs always take place in scaling and aren't necessarily a bad thing but in this model you're making the trade off at layer 1.

The headline is out of context, but the point being made is about trading. If a trader can buy an asset and see it increase in value, as long as they sell before the fall it is a good trade. If I correctly predicted Google stocks were going to increase 20x before crashing to zero, buying them isn't stupid. Holding them to zero is though.

Actually, I believe pre-2012 coinbase transactions were paid to an ECC public key instead of a SHA256 hash of a public key as now.
This means any unspent coinbase transactions from that era are vulnerable to quantum attack and hypothetically can all be claimed in the future by whoever cracks their encryption first.
All the early unspent blocks suspected to be mined by Satoshi would be vulnerable to this. If the private keys are still held, simply moving the coins to a new address would make them safe. They could also be transferred to a burn address, or the network work could be hard forked to make the vulnerable coins unspendable, though this would be incredibly contentious.

Your argument makes no sense because guess what: Drink driving is banned.
It is dangerous to other people with insufficient benefit to society.
Driving provides a public utility, but is is dangerous and so is heavily regulated. Vehicles must be maintained and insured, drivers must be qualified and physically able.

Satoshi was a human and didn't get everything right. He also made predictions about the progression of Moore's law that haven;t materialised by an order of magnitude. He didn't envisage the rise of GPUs and then ASICs. It also seemed like SPV could be implemented quite easily, but in reality it is impossible to do without major compromises.

Released and activated are not the same, SegWit must be activated before hard fork is released to be activated as per agreement. The promised hard fork code will be ready for review long in advance of release. Release in production implies activated.
Key parts of agreement:
The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.
We will run a **SegWit release in production by the time such a hard-fork is released** in a version of Bitcoin Core.

Instead of blocks full of detailed transactions, blocks would be a giant list of inputs and outputs, where all the individual transactions are pooled together so you can't tell how many coins each person has. The individual transactions information is blinded by crypto magic and known only to the recipient.
New coins cannot be created out of thin air as the inputs must always match outputs.

I look forward to part 2.
I think Ethereum is really important for Bitcoin. Its development is going to help us learn a lot of lessons to bringing smart(er) contracts to Bitcoin.
I'm worried about the obsession with PoS, which I've tried to study with an open mind and am not convinced it is viable. I spoke to Vitalik about DOS risk of having miners take it in turns to publicly create blocks (DOS each in turn and the system fails), and he seemed naive to the risk (as he did to the risk of hard fork/ETC debacle).
In scientific enquiry, we try and determine whether something is possible, and then we implement it.
The PoS tunnel vision is the opposite of scientific method... they've decided (promised investors and made a lot of money) that PoS will work, and then they've got to figure out how.

They promised the developers present would have written code 3 months after SegWit. July was an estimate at that time, not a commitment.
@_date: 2016-10-08 14:29:15
Drivechains are an alternative implementation for sidechains.
It is a more simple method of implementation, where more responsibility for transferring Bitcoin between chains is with miners. This also technically provides the possibility that miners could steal all Bitcoin from a drivechain, however there are ways to mitigate this risk, and the outweighing benefits may make this a more attractive implementation.
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:15:08
He acknowledged it by signing the agreement. The agreement, SegWit and then a hard fork are the resolution. If he goes back on his word he loses credibility, that's his choice, there's no signs that he will. Even if he did there were other signers and the community has formed consensus. so don't worry.
The interesting part will be if SegWit activation is blocked. The agreement was that the hard fork wouldn't be deployed until after SegWit had activated. They'll have the code ready as a carrot to get SegWit over the line if any sort of resistance proves resilient.

OK, I've produced some numbers and a method. You are right, it has few points. Also, I said exponential when I meant linear, my apologies (edit, oops, no, I stick by my exponential claim). However, the blockchain is almost doubling in size every 12 months by any method. Go on, give me some numbers and a method that show otherwise, I'll listen with an open mind.
We should assume full blocks as it is not inconceivable that a major international incident (2008), or investor rush could spike demand to 100% full blocks at short notice. In engineering you always anticipate the edge case.

That said, I believe in second chances and disagree with the criticism of you for working with someone with a criminal past. I just don't buy this he's the victim thing, the law about mailing explosives exists for a reason as do drink driving laws - it puts other people's lives at risk without their consent. Willfully doing this is criminal behaviour.

Based on what? How many Bitcoin transactions do you think take place by users on their own nodes these days?
In reality, most users use a few wallet providers which will most likely update very quickly so they don't lose market share.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:55:41
In development you should assume the worst case.
Avg block size at 31 Dec (
2013: 0.142MB
2014: 0.236MB +66%
2015: 0.475MB +100%
2016: 0.745MB +56%
Average: +74%.
From hitting 1MB (where we've been for a while) that with no cap that would extrapolate to:
1 year: 1.74MB
2 year: 3.08MB
3 year: 5.27MB
"A few years" is far more likely to be within 1 year based on recent history. Especially as we hit another hype cycle.

If not for to make Bitcoin more accessible and usable, under what circumstances would you ever favour a block size increase?
@_date: 2016-10-11 08:16:31


The average web server doesn't have to download and store ALL the other websites on the internet.
If they did, the average website would be a damn sight smaller than 1MB.
Also, webpage data compresses well. The average compressed size will be far smaller. Signature and address data does not compress.
Webpages are a terrible comparison.

Such a checkpoint is a hard fork, all clients would need to hard fork to protect from reorganisation. Only miners would have incentive to do this. Without the users it's pointless.

It is an unusual one, a Schroedinger's fork, kind of hard and soft at the same time depending on which has the longest chain. Changing consensus rules after a soft fork is a hard fork. Adding a checkpoint after a soft fork falls into this category.

UASF wasn't designed to split the chain, it was designed (successfully) to pressure miners to activate SegWit. BCC has been designed to create a split.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:14:47
Bitcoin transactions have been growing exponentially, while we wouldn't fill 2MB blocks right away it won't be far, and a further year down the line we'd be hitting 4MB and then 8MB if current trends continue. is correct to assume full blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:41:27


No it wasn't.
ABC/BCC is a hard fork. UASF is a soft fork. Hard forks create a split wit anything less than 100% support, soft forks create a split with anything less than 51% support.

Look, I'm a Core supporter, I've made many arguments against scaling on-chain unless necessary.
Of course increasing the block size increases the storage requirements. I remember running a node when the block size was 2GB on my laptop. as everyone did. Now the barrier to entry is higher and there are far fewer nodes.
Everything is about tradeoffs.
Your sums are slightly wrong, 1MB blocks currently = 52GB per year, not 34GB.
The proposed idea, SW + 2MB HF would be equivalent in typical usage to 200GB per year. However, with SW, witness data does not need to be stored long term and can be safely pruned once validated without a compromise in security making the burden more like 100GB. Bandwidth is a bigger factor than storage for many.
I believe layer 2 solutions is the answer, but in the mean time $1+ tx fees is bad for usability. If we need a small modest block size increase to keep Bitcoin accessible to more people until the layer 2 solutions can pick up the slack I think it's a tradeoff worth making.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:09:46
'Rejected over and over'.
By whom? There is no central authority of Bitcoin. There is a lot of support within the community for a modest HF block size increase, sure, some oppose. You'll never get a solution with 100% support, but that is not what is required.
I'm not convinced there is sufficient opposition or compelling technical reasons against a 2MB HF in the future. Sure, Core developers are under no obligation to support Barry's proposal, but its a misnomer to think they are the ones who have to compromise or get to decide on a HF. Even if every core developer agrees to Barry's HF plan, if you're right the community won't go along with it so resistance not required.
