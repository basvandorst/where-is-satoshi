If you want a shared hot wallet use electrum! Don't do it with bitcoin-qt

That is unanimity aka unanimous consensus

Sorry I was referring to "when everyone agrees"

You were not the first trying to convince them, I did that too a while ago! As always users pushing bitcoin is the best way to convince people accepting them!

Sure this is a minus for the growing of the bitcoin economy. But I think all the plus that this technology/system has are more powerful than the minus.

Yes this is an issue and probably will became less significant in the future. For the moment you have to be organized: keep on your exchanger of choice the amount of fiat needed for your average purchase (or remember to send the amount few days before the purchase). Then exchange FIAT--&gt;BTC at the same moment of your purchase: no gain, no loss.

What about the fees?
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:06:36
Nice design but the FAQ... really? I don't like jokes when money are involved. Instead I was hoping to find some useful information like what your fees are. I'm sure that will be fixed before leavig the beta but still very unprofessional IMHO. Just a suggestion, no offence.

For DIY lovers:
Is a firefox extension for blocking (actually making it really difficult) the access to the specified websites. I guess there is some alternative for chrome too.

True, always choose wisely who you trust and with how much money.

If the bicoin economy grows enough the volatility should decrease. I'm not an economy expert but it seems reasonable to me.

They let you use their free service basing on your ip address. I think the same rule applies for subscription plans.
