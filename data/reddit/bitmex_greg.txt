Trading derivatives on BitMEX can appear to be complicated but it is as straight forward as trading spot Bitcoin on other exchanges. The main difference is that you only trade with Bitcoin; that is you buy and sell contracts using Bitcoin as margin and all profit or loss is denominated in Bitcoin. There are a number of strategies that can be applied to Futures trading, such as arbitrage and market making, in addition to speculation.
Additionally, trading derivatives has the advantage that you do not necessarily require the position to be fully funded. That is, let's say you wanted to have $1000 worth of exposure in Bitcoin. With a normal spot exchange, you would need to have $1000 in your pocket to buy $1000 worth of Bitcoin. On BitMEX, we allow you to trade on margin where you can leverage yourself up to 100x on our most popular products such as the XBTUSD Swap and our Quarterly Future, currently the March XBTH17. This means that for $1000 worth of exposure, you would only need $10 as margin to trade with. 
Note that, leveraged positions can increase your profits, but at the same time increase the amount of risk, so much so that you can lose your entire margin on the position entirely if the position becomes liquidated. Liquidations are done when your Maintenance Margin is breached (at 0.5% on a 100x position). So, for the above example, if the price moved 0.5% below your entry point then your long $1000 position would become liquidated and you would lose your $10 that you put down as margin.
