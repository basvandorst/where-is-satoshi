Don't buy yet. It will be below 10USD soon. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:32:50
because mtgox is closed. when it reopens the value of btc will race to below 10 dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:25:39
my buy order is at 7USD.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:04:09
I just added more money to my buy order at 7USD because of this post.

I JUST GOT 1K COINS FROM OP!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:05:09
because you don't know where the peak is.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:54:58
It will go far below 70.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:27:42
Wait until it is 1USD, probably around June.

You came perilously close to saying "this time is different." 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:39:02
No. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:13:46
it's crashing just like everyone outside of board predicted. mtgox is closed. when they reopen your btc will soon become worth what it was a year ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:50:14
Probably not. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:15:44
what price did you buy in?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:41:14
it's about to tank hard. it might stabilize near the previous mean at some point, but that will be months from now. people who bought above 100 will likely never see that money again.

i just checked and mtgox is down again. what in the fuck is happening here? why would anyone put more than 100USD into this shitfest at current prices? i don't want anyone to suffer the sorts of losses they've been lured into but i can't understand why people are putting buy orders into this market right now.

this is very dangerous thinking. please be careful.
