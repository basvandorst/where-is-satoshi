WTF does that even mean freenet is a network not a coin.

If you want a quick and easy anonymous cash try selling bitcoins at ttps://localbitcoins.com/?ch=1eqe

FREEnet should be free, not payment based. If you want to get voluntary donations just list an address with your freenet profile and post updated uptime stats every 24h

Freenet is like Bittorrent running the node improves the network. Any silly attempt to force users to pay to use freenet would not be beneficial. This is like the idea of taxing per MB transferred. Also due to the nature of freenet even when you are not searching content your node will be passing along requests. So everyone who joins the network looking for money will also lose money due to being charged when they pass it along. Maybe look into how freenet works a bit more and you would understand there is no way to leech on freenet thus no need to create incentive "seeding".

Cool never heard of bounty source will do.
I only posted the address as proof I have 4 BTC to send to the creator of a freenet plugin.

I think adoption is driving the price up and open bazaar and freenet

There is something like this its called Storj. Also would not paying for content completely ruin the anonymity of the content you are requesting?
Also for someone who wants to not pay to use freenet how would the accomplish that?
What stops me from creating a Sybil attack (pretending all the nodes you connect to are different but are all really me) and charging a stupid amount for each request?

Why would I need to pay to use a free open source network. This seems really backwards, it would cause content creators to shy away from the network because they would have to pay to upload anything.
If I was to leave my computer running and not look up anything I would see charges because of the fact that its constantly sending and passing along requests for each node that "sells" a block there is one that is requesting it. In the end it would be a 0 sum game where all the money would you used to see content you would make back by passing new content in the network. Also it severely endangers the anonymous nature of it.

Tip your friends and those who you do daily business with. Teachers, bosses, coffee makers. Let your local community become a bitcoin hub then the corporations will follow.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication. It uses a decentralized distributed data store to keep and deliver information, and has a suite of free software for publishing and communicating on the Web without fear of censorship. Both Freenet and some of its associated tools were originally designed by Ian Clarke, who defined Freenet's goal as providing freedom of speech on the Internet with strong anonymity protection.
