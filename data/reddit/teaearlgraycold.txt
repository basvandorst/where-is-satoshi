I see the notification on their site saying they support BCH. Is BCH centralized?

Maybe this is too pedantic, but IMO that's not cracking encryption. They're finding a private key that corresponds to a public key. That would then allow them to cryptographically sign a transfer transaction. You don't need to decrypt anything to steal bitcoins.

Don't think so. I remember claims it will be late 2018 early 2019 back in July/August of last year.
Random forum goers like to claim it's just around the corner but the reality is the Ethereum devs have a schedule and they've been sticking to it fairly well.

I haven't been around since the old days, so I wasn't aware of those initial goals. As far as I've been around (July 2017) I don't think the scheduled release dates have been unfulfilled. IIRC POS has been tested on the testnet, so it's not some pie-in-the-sky dream.

As proof that this won't happen again - similar hacks have happened multiple times since then and no forks have occurred.

I guess blockchain.info needs a segwit update.

The bit where the guy had to wait for his wallet to sync up was contrived to build suspense, though. He could have just plugged his public address into a blockchain explorer.
Additionally they should have done the same with the address that his 0.02 BTC got sent to. That would have let them know if the supposed total sum of 2.5 BTC were there.

Neither of them use a website and only store the keys locally. But in the case of a hardware wallet the private key is stuck on a dedicated device (and a paper backup). If the key is on your phone it's possible the phone could get malware and the key stolen.

In semver 1.0 doesn't mean "final". It's just the first release with a stable API.

You're mistaken if you think this is a new term since the recent blockchain forks.

Bitcoin has had value for a while. That's evident by its exchange rate.

I primarily only run debian. In debian, with the `unattended-upgrades` package, you can choose to have automatic updates for security reasons *if you want*. This is something you'd obviously want to do for a server, since there are actual angles of attack from remote locations.
But for a workstation that's blocking all incoming connections, if you're paranoid enough, you can decide to never update your OS in the background.
At the very least you can be assured that (assuming your OS wasn't compromised to start with) all updates are cryptographically signed by the debian package maintainers, and all updates can be reviewed on a line-by-line basis.

I'd still take potentially backdoored Linux over potentially backdoored Windows any day.
Updates that occur without your consent are a **feature** of Windows.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:04:25
Richard Stallman? IDK.
The point isn't that you are checking every update, it's that you can. If the US government wants to slip an exploit into Windows, all they need to do it coerce Microsoft and give them a gag order.
If they want to get an exploit into Debian, they need to get it right by everyone who will look at the patch. You *can* do this, of course. There are subtle bugs that can be introduced if people aren't paying close attention. But I'd take the system that's harder to put an exploit in if given the chance.

Maybe, maybe not. Either way, it's running un-auditable code.

You've obviously never moderated a large subreddit.
Subreddits aren't just open fields where people can do whatever they want. In order to keep the original subreddit goals in mind (goals created *by the moderators*) upkeep from people willing to uphold those goals is often necessary.
Suppose users want to turn into a conspiracy theory hoard that constantly complains about American politics. But that's not what the subreddit was created for, so if 50 threads complaining about the patriot act pop you, you remove them on the grounds that there are much better pre-existing locations for such discussion. Of course, threads deviating from the rules/norm are generally allowed by mods in small numbers, but you don't want an entire shift from the original focus.
It's like if you went to an NAACP meeting and started complaining about how the US's current war is unjust. The first time you do that you'll get some people who will agree with your off-topic discussion but then discussion will shift back to the focus of the meetings.
Keep doing that a hundred times and now they need to make a rule against that, or will ask you to stop showing up. There's a place for anything to be discussed, but you can't just show up somewhere with topics of discussion that deviate from the purpose of the forum and expect no resistance from the founders of that forum.

So is each bitcoin stored as a "key"? Are these keys what you get from decoding bitcoin blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:19:50
If you don't have the private key you don't own your crypto. Get a hold of the private key if you want control over your money.
As for where the money *is* it's a record that your public key holds a certain amount of bitcoin. Your *private* key is the only thing that will allow the editing of that record.

It's a medium of exchange and a store of value. Doesn't that make it a currency?
