Before you put your money into bitconnect, just buy BTC and wait some time.

Doesn't matter how much money you have, it's probably a "scam". 
Try to stay away from those scemes, they just want money from naive people. It's possible to get profits, but if something goes wrong everyone will go down.

Learn from it, even though it could drop again.
I think you missed the selling point by a lot, after a ~50% correction it is just gambling cause you never now when its going back up. Especially after most FUD is gone, like right now. People were ready to buy back in...

Step 1. Don't care about china,

Why china? it's mostly everyon else who wants to short this dip..

No it's not possible I know. In times like this people behave like it's the end of crypto. It's not the end. China will be a big part of crypto, they are just regulating things because the ICOs went crazy. ICOs are not generally banned btw, just for the public.
I think the western market damaged itself more than china because of the overreaction.

Yes hodling is not the most profitable thing to do, BUT trading isn't for everyone. I hate when traders tell how much money they made with a trade because that's not the whole truth. Most people are new to this stuff and they can't split emotions and money. Trading by emotions like you said is a bad thing.
It's totally legit to choose to hodl, where you just sit back, relax and take your profits after some time or you go through the nervwrecking learning part where you will probably lose some money until you make some.
Both are viable strategies, trading is more profitable but it takes a lot more effort to do well.
