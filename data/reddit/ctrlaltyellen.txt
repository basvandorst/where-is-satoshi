Loans? Debt? I am not connecting the dots. Loan officer. Why would I need a loan officer? All I need is good credit, first and last months + 1 month security deposit. If i need extra dollars I make a phone call. Unless you are speaking in code?

I've done it. In the past 72 hours since the price has rallied I have received texts and inquiries from about 6-8 people coming into the mix. 
TLDR A lot of outside cash is flowing into BTC right now.

Bitches with a business plan... Watch out for em. 
Yes to consult with people on bitcoin, something Ive been doing naturally for years now. Its just that now it looks like its prime time to go at it 100% instead of the odd request. 
The income will be based on similar model as localbitcoin traders, and some trades will be conducted on localbitcoins, wallofcoins, btc-e and p2p. This is the model a few successful traders I know use. They can now rely on that for 100% of their income. 
It looks like bitcoin's user base is about to grow exponentially which will offer me plenty of new business/clients.
selling coins above market, and cashing people out below market by a few % on each side of the market. Be trustworthy and build up a clientele
Or would you like spreadsheets and mission statements and all that jazz?

I was talking to a not dumb girl about a week ago, and she asked so why is the price going up. I said, because the world governments are printing to much money. 
She looked at me funny and said, Are you serious or is that just some sort of far out conspiracy theory. 
I smile and politely said, the central banks have printing trillions upon trillions in the past 5-6 years.
HUuuuh.

countries like venezuela and brazil, or chinese, who have a use case beyond retail fluff will see the virtues. Americans still have access to food, jobs, and secure banking/dollars. 
We might see fellow americans debtslave situation different than they do, but once they go hungry is when people will see why the big fuss. Otherwise its just a speculative investment for fun at this moment in time. To push all these 'conspiracy' ideas, dont sell.
Im still not entirely convinced that bitcoin is a federal reserve based scheme once they figured out their debt based systems have pretty much destroyed the global economy and the only way forward is with a digital gold like unit. But then again the wheels upstairs in my brain think up a lot of crazy shit. Which is an issue of the times. It is so hard to believe anything you read.

This rally is the real one. Stampede into crypto.

Everyone should run their own node.

Well that does it, you have convinced me to go apply for a job as a burgerflipper at mcdonalds... 
I have been doing this for years already. The store front will cost me less than 250-300/month, it offers me more than just a business opportunity. I guess I should rephrase this, its an office with a window at street level that has lots of foot traffic. It wouldnt be like walking into a verizon or a chipotle, rather a room with a desk and a computer.

I am hoping to secure a storefront with lots of foot traffic in a cool town with lots of very open minded people in a few weeks. My goal is to put a small bitcoin sign, free consultations and make my bread on buying and selling them coins outside of exchanges for a small premium. And maybe a tablet or a screen that displays a live bitcoin chart, all day and night. 
Lets hope they rent to me!!!
