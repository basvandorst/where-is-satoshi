I would argue that the US Constitution is probably the most libertarian national charter around. In light of which I would flip your question around and ask you and the rest of the antiliberty crowd to quit fucking with our constitution!

The most useful thing I can think of is for them to integrate Bitcoin into Google Wallet in a way that I can use my Bitcoin at any merchant that I could normally use Google Wallet at. Here's what I'm imagining:
1. Deposit Bitcoin in my Google Wallet account
2. Go to McDonalds and swipe my NFC Google Wallet enabled phone over their terminal to pay for my meal. (Let's say the meal cost $5.00)
3. Google takes $5.00 worth of Bitcoin off my balance and sends $5.00 fiat to that McDonalds.
I think the above scenario could not only help Bitcoin, but having all us Bitcoin zealots on there side could really help Google Wallet become more mainstream.
Just my 2¢...

Typically you either quote somebody to support your opinion, agree with the opinion of the person your quoting, or to debunk the opinion of the person you are quoting. It definitely doesn't sound like he's trying to debunk this opinion, which leaves me believing that the only reason he is paraphrasing this quote is because he either agrees with it or it supports his position.

I like that the dutch word for taxes is "belastingen." Makes me think of flabbergasted or something similar, which is generally how I feel about taxes. The word "taxes" seems quite tame in comparison.

The problem is that the consensus of population can be dead wrong. For a long period of time the consensus was that slavery was totally cool.
The problem with Democracy is that it is rule of the majority. When the majority has absolute power, the minority has no rights outside of those the majority allows it to have.

I don't get it. I have never met a person that couldn't understand that cents are fractions of a dollar. Why couldn't they understand that they can have fractions of a bitcoin. Maybe you could make it easier to grasp if you equate cents to mBTC or μBTC.
