They seized DPR's coins because he was a criminal. These rulings will most likely make you a criminal as well allowing for them to seize your coins or at least throw you in jail for some charge like money laundering or tax evasion.
You should care because of that. Even if it isn't morally right or legally justifiable. They will do it if they think they can get away with it.

Blockchain.info isn't meant to be anything past a wallet service and the block explorer. That is why you can keep the keys/wallet on your own computer.
Banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world, which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities. This began around 2000 BC in Assyria and Babylonia. Later, in ancient Greece and during the Roman Empire, lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations: they accepted deposits and changed money. Archaeology from this period in ancient China and India also shows evidence of money lending activity. So lol at you.

Transactions on Monero's blockchain are about 3600 bytes compared to Bitcoin's 600ish. Even without the adoption of Bitcoin the blockchain is almost a third of the size of Bitcoin's. It simply will not scale. Consumers such as us will not be able to run full nodes. It will lead to centralization.

Anarchy can be defined as that. In fact that is the first result from a google search. However..


In a functional society Anarchy would mean that their would be multiple "governments" competing on the free market to provide the best services to its "citizens". It would be similar to the democrats creating laws and republicans creating their own as well. Each law would function but people could choose which ones they want to follow by signing a contract with either of the parties. It would not be much different than buying insurance.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:02:31
Because the system "depended" on it to function. Bitcoin doesn't need these regulations to continue to function. It can and will continue to function for as long as there are peers to connect to and miners to mine. These regulations are like pork on any congressional bill. They are over the top and completely unnecessary.

Regulation occurs within Anarchy just the same. It takes much more than a single party to implement the rules. Look at bitcoin it takes at least 51% of the network to fork. It's not one person or party enforcing the rules on everyone else. It is everyone coming together to form a set of rules that can function without outside intervention.

People tend to overestimate their own abilities and underestimate others. Karpeles did it because he is an egotistical son of a bitch, while Ross probably did it for securities sake. All that captcha script did was generate the letters and numbers. The main server requested another server (that was still in the SR architecture and bound to localhost) to generate the script and send it to the main server which then delivered it to the user.
He separated the services because of the strain of the DDOS attacks brought down the single server config.

CoinSafe isn't a wallet at all. It uses a blockchain wallet API key. You can buy a tablet and lock it down to your retail counter (or whatever) and people can come up and enter their own details like how many coins and payment method. If the customer wants to pay via a debit or credit card you don't need to do anything. If and only if the customer wants to pay in cash do you have to do anything. CoinSafe will tell the sales associate or owner to accept X amount of cash. The retailer will process the cash and CoinSafe will dispense the coins from the blockchain wallet automatically.

Look at the words you just typed. I'm sorry to be so harsh but seriously look at the term Military Industrial Complex. 
    Military - the armed forces of a country.
    Industry - any general business activity; commercial enterprise
    Complex - composed of many interconnected parts; compound; composite: a complex highway system.
When put together the term literally means multiple people or groups of people creating and selling products relating to war and the military.

The government would have to have all the records from everyone in more detail than at the moment. Even if that happens a person can break the chain of ownership essentially using bitcoin as a tax shelter.
Governments exist because they (are supposed to) offer services that people on the free market cannot. So as long as people feel like social services and such are necessary then there will continue to be paid taxes.
Bitcoin could be used to resist corruption and also the system we use for a transparent government. Anyone can use bitcoin to follow the money and we the people would truly see the extent of corruption and control.

They never connect them in the first place. The Kraken employees create the keys offline and then only use the public key to send funds to. Since the private key has never been on the network and has no connection to the network the coins cannot be sent without the proper procedure.

Hypothetical. What would happen if the US government could not pay for food, vehicles, gas, ammo, and soldiers? If they use force they only further engrain the idea in the taxpayer's (and probably soldier's) mind that they should not support the floundering state. There has never been a system that allowed people to opt out but bitcoin allows that since the state cannot seize it with proper protections.

The actions of the journalist were wrong because they violated his right to privacy. She dove into great detail and lied to get the information in the first place.
The people who collected the personal information of the journalist did not lie to her. They did not collect anything that was not already publicly available on the internet.
The journalist seems to have no qualms about putting herself out there and violating the personal space of others as well. Her ethical view points on privacy are far different than yours and they lead to the violation of Satoshi's privacy.

Bitcoin has a smaller transaction size so it will be able to stay on our hard drives longer perhaps indefinitely. Monero is different because the transaction size is much larger meaning it will take up that space faster especially if it gains the same amount of transactions that bitcoin handles.
Sure. Hard drives can scale in size but until more work is done on minimizing ring signatures it will not be able to be hosted on consumer's hard drives for much longer.
