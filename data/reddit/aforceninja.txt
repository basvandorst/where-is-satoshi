What &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:43:36
Got in around $5 and thought it was a joke. I would be retired very comfortably today if I had held onto more of my btc
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:02:16
I wasted 10btc on 10 of those stupid usb miners....i kept one to remind myself how much of an idiot i was
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:45:18
This makes no sense. I would also like to know. I have a few kicking around in a box somewhere
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:07:38
2006? Bye
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:49:33
I’m thinking coinbase transactions have slowed down because of a bunch of credit card companies restricting purchases
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:27:39
Great way to lose your btc due to charge back
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:02:06
I also had a jelapeno...sold it when it wasn’t profitable anymore and they price rocketed up right afterwards :(

Vancouver and Toronto have huge Chinese populations

Guaranteed next block confirm. If I was doing a trade worth 6+ digits, why not.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:40:03
Why not 2010?
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:46:27
Pretty sure you will have to pay normal fees
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:28:21
First btc block was mined in 2009
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:23:23
Anyone can bet. Yes or no
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:49:17
I’ll make a bet
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:41:26
I’ll bet against you
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:25:37
Losing side bids go to the winners and get split based on the ratio that’s calculated on when the bet was placed. Not sure if I’m explaining it properly, maybe check out the faq
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:28:55
Yup. If there is nobody that bets against you and you win. You get your bet refunded fully

Depends how much btc you have. That 0.25% trading fee will really eat into any difference you had
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:42:58
I sent a certified bank draft to myself from one bank to another and they put a hold on it...both Canadian banks and using Canadian dollars

I doubt the bitcoin makes their food taste any better though
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:14:25
Lots of websites user miners. Just search up Coinhive
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:07:12
Yup blockchains wallet is another good one
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:54:28
Just inverse yourself
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:24:33
I feel your pain
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:59:51
I get notifications weekly from localbtc that someone is trying to get into my account.
Out of the two I would choose quad and enable 2FA
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:39:23
What’s the point if you hodl forever?
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:08:54
I've been around bitcoin since 2012. Sold over 100btc along the way, last time was 0.5 @ $2500. I'm not upset at all.
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:46:13
They actually shipped me mine :)

“Insert sob story”
Please help
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:37:47
Wex token?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:09:15
Their tokens are trading at a fraction of their value and they are slowly buying them back eventually being worth 1:1 
If you can buy and hold this might be a good option to increase your holdings
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:10:01
Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down....just HODL
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:44:34
