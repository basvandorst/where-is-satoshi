Wouldn't the FBI have to register as an MSB beforehand?
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:55:13
Definitely Have! See the latest update from Vircurex below.
We will regularly publish updates here on the number of accounts affected
All in all we have a bit over 90,000 registered users and accounts. Due to the freeze and the subsequent distribution of the available funds, a large number of accounts have been restored to their rightfull account balance, some unfortunately remain frozen for the time being and will over time be released as and when funds become available. Here the number of accounts with a frozen balance:
As of 25. March 2014:
BTC: 355 accounts
LTC: 1,563 accounts
TRC: 77 accounts
FTC: 42 accounts
Total accounts affected: 2,037 or less probably, as other users and myself are probably in both the BTC and the LTC list, or possibly all of them.
Less than 2.5% of total users affected. Not too shabby for the first distribution of funds.

Given the volume I am currently seeing on the site, I am looking forward to the next update. The fact that anyone got any Bitcoin back is giving me a warm fuzzy feeling about this.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:39:06
I am one of those 355 and I had less than 2 if that puts it into perspective.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:01:52
A paper wallet is not digital though.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:20:32
There are only a total of like 2,037 accounts possibly affected currently for frozen coins according to their update.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:12:45
See, it's back.

It's right here.

In their announcement they actually said there would be about 30 mins of downtime. I'm wondering if this is it. I guess it depends on when March 25th starts for them.
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:31:19
Maybe, but I think that this is a much better plan than any other exchange has had so far for managing an issue like this. Time will tell obviously, but I am feeling a bit better about things knowing that funds are actually getting paid back, even if mine aren't yet.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:12:20
As I said, scheduled downtime... It's now back online.

Over 2x BTC volume than Gox in that same time period!

Yeah... Nice try random 3 letter organization.

The creator of Bitcoin should donate to this fund to make it very evident that this man is not the creator of Bitcoin. They obviously have plenty of Bitcoins to donate, and it would be a very noticeable transaction on the blockchain, as everyone is watching those original coins. Otherwise, I feel that this guy is actually the creator and will never tell anyone, just like his brother said. It could also mean there are only ever going to be 20 million Bitcoin every available.
@_date: 2014-02-26 08:30:18
2,801,657 in the last 30 days? If people were buying that many Bitcoin the price would be going up more than down across the world lately, as that is over 44% of the market share. That shit does not add up. Massive amounts of Bitcoin are being sold on that exchange in the time period of this Mt. Gox mess. Who cares if it's for lower than market value if you are stealing them!
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:34:31
I currently don't like the outcome of this in any case. Either the original creator of Bitcoin is so disconnected from the community and media at this point that all of the Bitcoin those original addresses held are gone, or this guy Dorian is making off with even more of the total Bitcoin supply and is actually the creator of it. 
The original Bitcoin creator should support this fund with some serious donations out of his approx. 1,000,000 Bitcoin for this guy's trouble being named as the creator of it, or that person is a piece of shit. Either the original creator doesn't care that the name he chose as a pseudonym is ruining someone's life, or this guy is really the creator of Bitcoin.
My second point means that there could only be 20 million Bitcoin in supply or less available ever. If I were the original creator of Bitcoin and I was sitting on that many coins, I would totally support this fund with a stupid amount of Bitcoin to show that this guy is really not him. That is the only way to prove it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 05:21:18
There are at least 355 of us that are probably willing to trade out of it :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:59:59
TL;DR - Some may be junk, but the ones that aren't serve a purpose.
Some of those coins are already dead. Solidcoin and Ixcoin definitely. The others are still active in some way or another I believe. Litecoin and PPCoin are for sure.
Some people here are not seeing the full potential for the use of alternative virtual currencies to Bitcoin. I see it as a whole new global currency marketplace similar to the USD, Euro, and other worldwide fiat currencies currently in circulation, but virtual. What is wrong with a freer free market? :) 
Most alternatives are a direct fork of the original Bitcoin software, which should give you an indication of how important Bitcoin is to the cryptocurrency movement, but it will not be the last virtual currency. Was the iPhone the first and last smartphone? No. Since Bitcoin was released open source, nobody can complain about alternative virtual currencies. Expect many! Some will suck and some will kick ass. Some might even surpass Bitcoin in functionality and purpose. It's all part of open source software development.
Take it a step further. Think of a country with just some PCs online and not very good video cards. Bitcoin is not a very viable coin for them to mine at the current difficulty, or trade for that matter most likely given the prices lately. They could however mine or trade for other alternative currencies with less difficulty and much lower prices. 
In fact, alternative virtual currencies like Litecoin, PPCoin, and even Terracoin are able to be traded for Bitcoin fairly easily, and in some cases at a higher profits given difficulties and exchanges rates at any given time. Do your research on what coins you trust. 
I currently trust Bitcoin and Litecoin to weather the storms, but others might prove their worth as well. Currently though, the others are far too new for my comfort zone, and have some baggage with them.

Try the 12.11 beta drivers. Newest is not always best for mining.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:30:19
I like it, now we just need to get all the free Bitcoin sites to say Satoshis instead of mBTC and uBTC :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:06:22
I make my living on computers, but it's a paper wallet only for cold storage in my book. Solar flares scare me a little in the case of Bitcoins. They can't do much to a paper wallet.

It's also quite silly to think that Bitcoin is not supposed to deflate and gain value. That was part of it's design, and exactly why people are collecting them. Dumb logic in this infographic.
@_date: 2013-03-25 10:41:49
I've been leaning more towards something like the Paper Wallet and Brain Wallet found here,  for a more secure Bitcoin wallet than any exchange can ever provide.
@_date: 2013-03-25 10:33:18
Correct. Any online wallet that owns the private keys can walk off with your Bitcoins, or get hacked and lose them also. You are in fact storing your Wallet on an unencrypted service such as Dropbox as well, which is adding to the security issue. 
I would use SugarSync instead, as it has 128-bit AES encryption for all files if you feel the need to backup your wallet in the cloud. On top of that I would make sure the wallet is encrypted for large sums of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:24:26
It's better than trying to use Digg...
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:39:39
Because they aren't really worried about scams. I got scammed through a purchase on Paypal I made, and they refused to give me my money back because the item was digital. I said no, it's a service. They didn't care and they made their money, while I got ripped off. Go figure.
@_date: 2013-03-19 09:31:45
I think the most important sentence to note from the MSB definition can be found here, 
"Thus, **a person who engages as a business** in the transfer of funds is an MSB as a money transmitter, regardless of the amount of money transmission activity.
I am no lawyer, but this means to me that unless a person is trying to act as a business mining coins and selling them (ie. mining coins as part of your exchange operation), solo mining operations (ie. individual hobbyists) would not apply to this specific language. 
Bitmining on an old computer and video card is hardly "engaging as a business in the transfer of funds". I would be engaging as a hobbyist, as would many other hobbyist miners. I collect baseball cards, comic books, and vinyl records as a hobby too. Sometimes I mine them out of the trash for free or a yard sale for cheap. They are all worth money to another collector for real USD. Neither of us have to fill out funny paperwork to sell things to each other in that capacity. This is reefer madness all over again!
As long as you claim and pay the taxes on your income from said hobbyist exchanges, I don't see the issue at all from the government's perspective.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:30:40
Except that it is one, centralized, website. Nice try Ripple employee.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:25:28
I would definitely do this if more major merchants accepted Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:29:44
Well, that was informative. So that's all you have, bad grammar and a theoretical scenario. Given the source code is fully available for the community to vet, your position fairly weak. 
Stop slandering the project here, and if you find something in the source code post an issue for the developer to explain. They are active in the issue queue.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:09:05
I recommend  only for such things. If you are very paranoid, download the source yourself from Github and run it on a local machine that is unplugged from your network. It's merely an HTML file with embedded Javascript. Running it offline will ensure nothing is being transferred elsewhere.

I've been here for a week, and from what have read so far, please be careful with most online wallets for large amounts of Bitcoin. Brain wallets and paper wallets are much more secure in my opinion for such a "secure" wallet. Something like StrongCoin is an interesting concept for larger wallets for secure storage, as the private keys are not stored on their "centralized" servers. 
The more popular Bitcoin becomes, the more malicious attackers are going to try and infiltrate the system we currently know as a secure way of transferring money. Bitcoin is only computer software, not magic beans folks. In any case, storing any large amount of Bitcoin in any online wallet requires a large amount of trust in that website. I currently do not have that at all given my research over the last few weeks of all Bitcoin wallets and exchanges.
One of the disadvantages to using an online Bitcoin wallet is that most, if not all but one, Strongcoin.com, services store the **private keys** for **your wallet** on **their servers**. That totally defeats the purpose of a decentralized system that is secure and a convenient service. Their centralized service could end up getting hacked and losing all the private keys to the wallets they host, and the Bitcoins those addresses are storing. 
In the end, either they are going out of business in a Chapter 11, or a bunch of customers are getting screwed. Neither of which is ideal for Bitcoin or any decentralized currency in general.
Several Bitcoin related services have gone out of business for this exact reason already, Bitcoinica is a perfect example. Security is going to be the deciding factor for a successful Bitcoin wallet or Bitcoin exchange. Decentralizing the security might be the only way to achieve this perfect harmony.
Hell, if Satoshi or any hacker has some sort of backdoor into the software, they could very well be able to almost instantly crack any administrator password to any Bitcoin Exchange on the network with the amount of computing power going through the network these days. Perhaps any password on the planet.

Not sure if they are even for 8, but try earlier drivers anyway.

Think of it like a stock exchange, but for only one stock, Bitcoin. Each exchange would act as a stock in the regular sense, and adjust the DOW (Bitcoin) average.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:04:00
Funny, I saw some old supercomputer was being turned off the other day and thought, now there's a mining rig haha. Then I saw how much electricity it used, and was sad.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:39:42
I say automated trading bots started this, and continue to effect the volatility in price. I continually see so many .01, .02, .03 trades in rapid succession. This seems to drive the price down faster it seems given the way the last price value is calculated on the exchanges. Once it starts to drop fast, people panic and start selling off larger amounts, which I also believe caused the crash.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:15:39
What we really need is some sort of open source, peer to peer, distributed trading API that all exchanges use for trading Bitcoin to stabilize the price. 
This will allow new exchanges to pop up, but still trade within the same trading network, similar to the DOW for instance and drive the market as one decentralized, but unified entity.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:49:31
No problem.  I spent hours trying to figure out a very similar issue.
@_date: 2013-06-23 19:03:51
BitCoin? Never heard of it. I think the "appropriate action" here is for state governments to learn more about Bitcoin before sending a letter like this, which clearly shows they know nothing about it. Wasting taxpayers money on lawsuits because you don't know what you are talking about should be a crime.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:51:22
So if you generate the wallet on a machine that has never been connected to a network, your point is invalid.

As I said, the source is there to read for everyone on Github if you are paranoid. Stop trying to fill these peoples' heads with your paranoid logic. If you are so all knowing, please inspect the code and get back to us. Otherwise, stop knocking someone's code they contributed as open source to the community you **paranoid** douche.

You obviously have no clue how open source works. The original source code is available on Github.com unforked, and has been vetted by the community.
The developer uses PGP to sign the site files and has by request added additional security measures to ensure that the PGP signature is matched to those in the Github repo. See this issue,  where it is discussed in great detail.
So get lost with your rhetoric. These are facts.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:51:21
