That’s only if the internet still exists in that scenario and even then it seems like a stretch

I just keep my seed phrase written down in a few locations for redundancy incase my house burns down for some reason. I also have a bootable flash drive with my wallets because I’m too cheap to buy a hardware wallet, but I’d rather not keep them on my main computer because I do to much on it to trust any wallet on it

With general momentum and the halving coming up that’s the value that I’ve been hearing. There are price predictions way higher than that too but 100k already feels like a reach for me.

so if we can get the private key, then the btc is ours?

This is why I don’t buy in if the price is sky rockets 20% within 2 days, I really wanted to buy in but a move like that didn’t feel safe enough for me to justify putting in more money. Lucky for me my gut was right and now I get to buy some dip.

Always hodl if you can afford to, general sentiment seems like its at least 20k by end of summer maybe 100k �� in a year but that’s a pipe dream in my opinion

In about 320 or so days the block reward for mining is going to be halved from 12.5 btc to 6.25 btc effectively reducing the current produced supply by half. So if I understand supply and demand at all this would mean that if demand stays at least the same or increases based on current publicity then the value of bitcoin will have to go up since there will be much less being produced.

The first time I did it I had used a live ubuntu installation with persistant storage and then just installed the exodus wallet and other wallets I was using at the time to store my coins. However, that option doesn't seem to work anymore with the recent updates to ubuntu.   
So thist time around I just used a windows to usb installer and installed my wallets to that os. If you do go down that route realize that anytime you connect the portable OS to the internet you are still exposing yourself to potential risks depending on how paranoid you are the effort to do this may not be worth the "security benefits".

We’ve always been in that trend unless you count the extreme media shill hype cycle of 2017 where everyone and their grandmother were getting into bitcoin without any grasp of what it was leading to many of them having shaky hands to begin with
