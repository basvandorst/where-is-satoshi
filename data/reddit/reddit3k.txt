In the beginning Satoshi created the Bitcoin and the Blockchain. 
Now the internet was trustless and wallets were empty, darkness was over the surface of deep finance, and the Spirit of Nakamoto was hovering over the banks.
And Satoshi said, “Let there be transactions,” and there were transactions.
Satoshi saw that the mining was good, and he separated the transactions from the centralized parties.

Low inflation will not destroy a society, but inflation is not as low as reported.
The middle class is getting more and more in trouble. A couple of decades ago a single income could provide a house, feed a couple of children at a average level of luxury.
Luxury products have gotten cheaper, or have been invented of course since say, the '60's and 70's... but last year a record 20% of households 
were on food stamps... 20%..  in 2013. 
Income does not keep up. Just a few Google search thingies:
"The annual Census data was recently released and showed a grim picture when it comes to household income. While GDP continues to grow and the stock market continues to reach new peaks, the middle class continues to fall further behind economically. Americans however continue to add mountains of student debt and auto debt as to make up for the lack of income growth. This appears to be a seminar of better living through debt. The middle class is witnessing the impact of inflation. While the CPI figures highlight moderate growth, just look at the cost of housing, cars, education, food, and healthcare and ask yourself if inflation really is that tame. It is not. Inflation is hitting middle class Americans where it hurts the most unfortunately. That is why the new Census data combined with figures on debt growth highlight a disturbing trend. That is a trend where middle class families are plugging gaps in income with going into deeper debt."

But what I really wanted to share is for your psychological health. You might want to search for EFT which stands for Emotional Freedom Techniques. It's easy and free to learn ( e.g. plenty of YouTube tutorials) and even though it might seem to be an odd process ( it's basically tapping with your fingers on certain body points while focusing on an event, bad thoughts, fears etc.).... It's good enough for usage by e.g. Israeli trauma teams.
  
Even if it works via a placebo effect.. is it makes you feel better, it's worth giving it a look I think.
I've personally experienced and seen in others some quite amazing effects. Reducing headaches in minutes, significantly reducing fears and or stress etc etc.
Above all: I hope that you'll recover soon from all of this. It might be though but there are no physical laws against both entirely and financially recovering!
Lastly, good to hear that you're talking about it. It's easy to turn inwards and lock ourselves away when hurt, while there are others who can help and support us.

It's not scare tactics to steal more money. There are easier ways, like just raising the tax levels.

Especially this last point thrusting the nation's will obviously have financial implications. 
It's longer term, but if areas become unliveable, is there still value in that local currency if there's not even the illusion of having it backed by the production of a country? If the migration streams become bigger, how are you moving your saved value with you to better areas?

I understand what you're saying, but:
- mining is frequently done at places where energy is cheap
- almost all over the world, the cheapest energy available is renewable nowadays
Admittedly, it was ambiguous what I wrote. I meant the consumption of physical stuff that you don't really need, that requires the usage of non-renewable resources.
  
Ideally we bring renewable energy to be present at such massive levels, that it becomes basically free. ASAP. 
Not just to help save the climate, but also because whole new markets would also open up. E.g. many more things would be recycled. Everything that requires physical/mechanical work could benefit.

And yes, money is money. It doesn't matter if it's a $25 or a $25K equivalent, it would be a pity if one loses it forever when it could have been prevented.
Additional bonus: it helps to really understand the fact that the hardware wallet is holding the keys, not the actual $crypto itself.
Of course a smaller test transaction can cost a bit more money, but this is a relatively low price to pay for that bit of insurance.
For the hodlers who are fortunate enough to hold a serious amount of money (the exact number is different for everybody, it's a "what feels comfortable" thing) I'd even recommend a combination of multiple hardware wallets.
Multiple of the same model so you can firmware update them at a different rate.
Different models so you are less tied to a particular brand.
Possibly even combined with one of those steel engraved products to store the key in a very physical way. 
 
 
Basically all of the above is a logical equivalent of a good data backup strategy combined with some insights from software development.
Having given quite a bit of IT advice over the years, the "one backup is no backup" rule is all too familiar.
An untested backup AND restore combination is not reliable.
How far one wants or needs to go all depends on the amount of money involved.
2 hardware wallets to protect $25 of crypto might be overkill. But $100 extra to protect, say, $2500, $25000 or $250000? 
There's no one fits all answer, and it's pretty much common sense...but everyone should think about their own personal risk profile.
An extra transaction fee gives an excellent risk/reward (insurance) result. Especially for those who get their first hands on experience with a hardware wallet.

I would always recommend, regardless of the amount of crypto you have, to first only transfer a very small amount.
Then reset the device completely and check and experience the recovery process. Yes, it'll take a few minutes extra time but knowing your safety net is in place is valuable.
 
Not necessarily with the Ledger products at all, but in general and over time I've seen enough messages by people in the crypto space who suddenly discovered that their recovery plan wasn't exactly known or correct when they actually really needed it...
In other words: take some time to learn the full system for you own piece of mind. :)

Fair question, sure.  
  
At an exchange you don't own the private keys and it's a hot wallet which means that  it's connected to the internet and hackers could potentially access it.  
  
A paper/hardware wallet is a cold wallet does not have this problem. A hardware wallet is basically a convenient version of a paper wallet. The private keys will never leave the hardware wallet, and transactions will be signed on the device. So even if you have a virus or other key-stealing-malware on your system, it's basically impossible to get access to the private keys.  
  
Of course it could be stolen. Then there is usually a pincode-like protection which erases the entire devices after X incorrectly entered pin codes. Restoring the wallet (on another hardware wallet, or software wallet if you really want) can be done using the list of 12/24/(36?) words that you've safely stored somewhere.
  
In that case you'd have lost access to your physical hardware wallet, but not to the cryptocurrencies on that device.

@_date: 2017-11-19 22:10:37
You cannot run that risk. If Bitcoin becomes worth even more, and that's a real possibility, even a fraction of a Bitcoin starts to become enough money to rob, kidnap (or worse..) someone for it.
  
A way to mitigate this is to start saying that you sold them to pay of some of your mortgage, helped a sick family member, pay for education, got your car fixed, etc. or something along those lines.
  
You have no potential upside that comes with people knowing you've got bitcoin and that you've made a profit. None, except for perhaps bragging rights.
   
There are only downsides and the sooner you start to publicly move away from being seen as a bitcoin profit based ATM, the better.

I totally read that in the voice of Mr. Burns..
But I agree! :)

Love that analogy! :)
Money is memory
Bitcoin is distributed memory with integrity checks.

Thank you for the reply and your link. I'll definitely read that. :)

Money being a form of memory. Love that line of thinking.

I think  deserves some more attention as well. :)

Happy halvening to all! :D

SpaceX and their upcoming, global Starlink network.
Might be very interesting for spreading bitcoin to areas where people usually don't have bank accounts. Makes the lightning network almost literal..8-)

It's very good to hear that you really did your research and put in the effort! (medium, redundancy, off-site backups, etc.)
Do know that I didn't want to appear as a know-it-all, but I've seen the pain of people losing data too many times in my life. Like someone with a degraded CD-R with baby or wedding photo's for example. It sucks, hence I wanted to make sure. :)

I think such scripts would in general be very useful to get quite a few people started, either on a local computer or on a VPS. So please consider sharing them on e.g. GitHub.
  
Which VPS server are you using btw?

Thank you sooo much for writing this down. Was out of the loop and that feeling has reduced quite a bit now! :)

Books have been written about this direction. E.g. the following, although I must admit that I have not read it myself.
But I've heard that if you dive into it, there are odd things like the Moon appearing to be hollow (this also counts for the two moons of Mars), but also the very orbit of the Moon. 
The current orbit is almost if it was 'parked' there, because the odds of getting the current orbit either by capturing an object passing Earth or being the result of a chunk of Earth smashed away by a collision are said to be astronomical (pun intended) small..
Interesting stuff. Your comment reminded me of putting that on some 'to research' list again for the moment I have some spare time. :)

Like a "Bitcoin Gateway Protocol". Nice. :)

This reminds me of an interview that recently watched with Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of Social Capital:
[He] discussed how money is an instrument of change which should be used to make the world a better place. **“Money drives the world for better or for worse. Money is going to be made and allocated – you have a moral imperative to get it and then use it to make a difference.“**
I liked that line of thought. Chamath had also spoken about Bitcoin at various times.

Please be aware that CD-R do degrade.
It depends on brand and storage location of course, but I've had CD-R's failing after about 7-10 years.

I couldn't help but think about this scene:
The Art of selling with Alec Baldwin

And that album should be called "SnoopCoin" then ;-D

A "Satoshi class Bitcarrier" does sound cool though :-)
