Here in Mexico I really don't see any awareness, usage or merchant adoption of Bitcoins! It's really rare (for not saying that don't exist) to find a business that accepts Bitcoins for payment but i want to change that! And that's why I'm accepting Bitcoins! :3 and I'm trying to get my girlfriend to accept Bitcoins in his business too! (
And when I say that I'm accepting Bitcoins it's saying that you can buy anything that I sell in Bitcoins :3
PS: sorry for my English! :s

You're losing faith in a currency that it's preforming awesome? 
Just because the coin went to the moon for a couple of days it doesn't mean that it's Shir or something.... 
If you didn't do your research properly it's not the coin fault
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:51:18

Mycelium! I downloaded that! 
You have any idea of how can I exchange my Bitcoins into euros? 
@_date: 2016-06-24 06:42:50

[take your reddit silver!!!](
@_date: 2016-12-14 03:25:11
I will check that local Bitcoins web page! 
And the problem it's that I'm going to Poland and there they have another currency call zlothy or something like that! 
So I will have to exchange my Mexican peso to Euro and then zlothy. And I think that it's too much :/
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:22:47
Yes :D
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:11:12
OK! So it's OK if I put $700 in BTC and $400 in Euros, or the Poland currency?
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:35:27
The problem it's that mycelium tell me that it's not into their hand if something happens to my money :/ 
And like I said I'm super nervous about my trip :S
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:02:01

Yes and no, when you exchange your MXN in a bank or a exchange house the cost of a dollar increments a lot! 
For example the dollar it's at 20.60 (example) you can sell your dollars at 20.40 or buy them at 20.90 or something like that sooooooo it's good for me XD 
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:11:14
Nah I stay there XD because I'm holding and that means that I'm in the moon :3
