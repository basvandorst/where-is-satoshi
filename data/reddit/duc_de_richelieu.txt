The financial illiteracy in this sub is staggering. Expiring contracts don't move the price since bitcoin futures are cash settled and those who want to hold them simply roll the contract to the next expiry date. Also bitcoin futures volume is very low so few investors care about bitcoin anyway.

I think Gladwell's book "Outliers" looks at successful people and comes to the conclusion that large part of their success is luck. Sure they worked hard and are intelligent but so are legions of others who don't make it
Cuban must be the most deluded billionaire. I listened to several of his predictions over the years out of curiosity  and they all turned out spectacularly wrong yet he believes himself a master mind. One time lucky was enough to be set for life and cover for all the other wrong decisions. Good thing they make fun of him on the "Silicon Valley" show.

Thanks for this insight, goes to show again that most of success is based on luck. Something that successful people vastly underestimate while overestimating their own abilities to feed their egos (probably a universal human trait).
