You can instantly buy with no verification ??

I have an account but I don't want to go through the hassle since I'll be wiring the money over and I already sent in verification just now so that I can use my bank account to directly deposit money. Still, I haven't been given a time frame and I don't want to wait around since I'll just be using this money to gamble lol.
We can go off a BTC price of 6,570? sound fair?

Yeah I saw that but all exchanges offering credit card btc look shady as hell.

I am local commerce since i'm willing to provide whatever proof that the seller deems fit that I am a legitimate buyer.

Yeah you're right man I'm using a middle man as well. At least I can admit it. No one is willingly to stop sucking at the tit of coinbase and wants everything to be regulated.

Thanks for all the help everyone. 
Kind of sad though that no one is willing to sell when the entire purpose of bitcoin was to be PEER TO PEER EXCHANGE and not be entirely run by middle man exchanges like coinbase, binance, gemini etc. Entirely defeats the purpose of crypto and really shows the state of it. Hope you sheep will wake up and start supporting local commerce.

I live in a rural area so that's not an option for me. I can do squarecash as well.

Ok thank you for the help GeneralZex. Paxful looks good. i'll be buying from there.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:14:09
I know there is a big chance I'll be scammed but I believe in the kindness of the crypto community.

Yeah I know it's archaic but I could also use google pay, amazon gift cards, squarecash. you tell me what you are comfortable with and I'll use it. I just know most people would like paypal.
