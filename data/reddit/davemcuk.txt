I would like a LOT more detail regarding fair distribution, "airdrop" is simply not enough information.

Like: Converting your hard-earned cash into a blob of putty that constantly changes size and shape. You pull/cut pieces of putty off to give to other putty blobs in return for stuff. The pieces of putty that you are being given are in limbo until the other putty accepts your piece of putty and this is verified by a mystical putty processor.

Yup, I have tried a few permutations, but I cannot figure out how Taxing would work in a foolproof and fair manner. I guess we're back to the days of the soldiers popping in to collect the lord's coins. VAT simply is not strong enough.

*That is why Value Added Tax exists. VAT or a derivative should be the only tax.
*(Edit)VAT won't work. Apologies.

* Bitcoin is sold to people as: Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
* When the people find out that it cannot actually do what it says on the top of bitcoin.org without risk and hassle, then they natrually get angry, because of the time wasted, and the general let-down.
* Angry people hate.

There. Is. Zero. Rush.
And, the current uptake is far from disappointing, considering that school fees are still being paid by careless early adopters. 
(School fee examples: Lose your wallet / Give your wallet to an outsider who says he'll protect your wallet with a flimsy password )

* You're asking two questions (Heading and Text). I'll answer the second one, with a question:
* Is is possible for a transaction to occur where I pay for exactly USD ($) 2.51 worth of goods when I currently have GBP (£), without having leftover bitcoins lying about on either side of the transaction (seller and buyer) and without either of us possibly (edit) losing some money in the process?

Lulz, at least we'll be working together for a change. The other approach is that all necessary utilities will become state-owned again ( you'll pay tax by being overcharged for using the utilities), and automatic toll roads will be one every 500 metres. The health system will be for the super rich only. On a positive note, sin tax will be eradicated and the pubs can flourish again, and the demand for the invention of a floating skateboard will be absolutely massive.

I know, let put all our bitcoins in a bank, they'll keep it safe for us.

Correct, but you will be running the risk of bad publicity and pissed-off clients accusing you of taking more than your allocated share of bitcoins (where in fact the software that they used to re-key their night-out bitcoins was the thief), and you would then have to trace the bitcoin receipt trail to prove your innocence to them, and the receipt trail can be ridiculously messy, never mind the mind boggling complexity of finding your public key's and their public keys in the log for that specific transaction.
Perhaps a better system for your scenario would be to offer points that the customer can purchase from home using their bitcoins and their large keys and encrypted wallets, and then they can come spend their points in your shop, of course, you will now have to deal with identifying those that own points ... sigh.

You can think of the current way that transactions are taking place as follows:
A man walks into your place of business carrying a tree, each of the leaves are painted red because red represents the man's ownership of those leaves. 
You own a tree, where the leaves are painted blue, blue indicating your ownership of those leaves.
Now, when you accept his bitcoins, you have to paint the leaves that are yours as blue (blue is the colour representing you).
In the process, both his and your tree's will have to be updated (they are the same trees), and the transaction that took place must be broadcast back into the network, so that all the other tree's can also be updated across the entire network.
When the leaves are painted blue, the paint consists of a new key and that key is attached to your blue.
It is vital that the new paint (the new key attached to your blue) is broadcast back into the network.
But it is not vital that the red leaves (belonging to your client and you) be updated yet, this can be done later, and it can be done when your customers are safely at home.
The only thing that needs to happen is that the guy who owns the red leaves carries with him the method that can unlock his red paint allowing it to be washed off of his leaves and replaced with your blue paint.
That method can be a simple password that he prepared before coming to your store, and can be compared to "drawing cash in preparation for a night out".
The trick is to change the mindset of bitcoin owners to plan ahead, and also to provide the bitcoin owners with the appropriate "safe" software to use to plan ahead with.
This is where the greatest problem lies, because malicious software can "prepare" extra leaves for release using the password and steal them from the owner.
TL;DR : Your clients should be able to prepare bitcoins for easy use before arriving at your shop, and all you would need is your on-site business computer, and something like a password from your clients. But, trusted software to prepare the bitcoins for simple use is nowhere (that I know of).

It just seems a bit odd that he is still evangelizing it after losing so much, kinda looks like he still has a heck of a lot of bitcoins somewhere, just waiting to be sold.

Like so:
1. Establish Bitcoins as a unique and desirable collectible.
2. Trade them between others that collect them.
3. Trade them for even more stuff.
i.e. Do NOT force the issue, just wait. True value has to be established, otherwise we'll have another .com bomb.
Humans! Damn impatient.
How long does it take a single fine ounce of gold to be discovered, hacked out of the ground, removed from the ore, purified, classified, labelled, recorded, marketed and sold?

Imagine that, flaunting the trouble stricken unstable Bitcoin as an alternative to PayPal, in a tone that promises "good advice".
Seriously, all of these products have their problems, do proper research and choose wisely.

Is this not implied in the name? It's my bitcoins! Mine! Thank you very much.

What you're asking is like going to the Mint and demanding that they make your paper money theft-proof.

Summary: I bought in early and did my best to increase the value of my coins by roping in noobs, now I am claiming that I was a victim.

Amazon now have the right to be the only one that can transpose the chain data with other data?

You will not have to store 100% of bitcoin's "log" of transactions in order for your transaction to be verified.
i.e. You get to store a lot less, which should mean faster processing.
