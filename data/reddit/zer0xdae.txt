Ah cool, thanks!

No, no it's not actually... bitcoin-qt is the graphical client for the bitcoin daemon (bitcoind).  Bitcoin is the specification.

Why electrum?
From the electrum FAQ - "There are 2^128 possible seeds for a deterministic wallet in Electrum. For comparison, the total number of Bitcoin addresses is 2^160."
Essentially, that means that an address generated by electrum is (hypothetically) 4,294,967,296X easier to crack than an address generated with a 'truly' random seed.
I realize that cracking a 128-bit key is infeasible; it just seems strange not to use the maximum available security when possible.  Has this been considered by your team?

I've used them for a bit, and so far they seem like a pretty solid wallet.  I trust this scheme more than GreenAddress &amp; Coinbase.
A few things that I did notice that were undesirable, however:
- When you're viewing a wallet, and click the 'Wallet Actions' and then do 'Remove from Dashboard' there is no confirmation.  It just immediately removes that wallet
- They don't have TLS 1.1/1.2 support, meaning weaker security.  They should probably also include DNSSEC support, since most of their wallet is implemented in JS, it's always good to make sure no MITM can occur...
- This one is more of a feature request - It'd be nice to see Firefox/Chrome extensions available to be able to store all the JS locally; similar to what blockchain &amp; GreenAddress have

While I agree with your feelings on the subject, there is nothing indicating that Karpeles 'wrote' anything in that document himself.  From what I can gather, it sounds like it was actually some third-party that wrote the draft.

The uhh site here ( is like... from 1997.  If that's your source of the "1 megabit key length" figure, that's like... not the same "MegaNET" that Kim Dotcom appears to be referring to now.  I think this is a completely separate development based on blockchain crap which wasn't even first introduced until 2008/2009.

Normally, the process is this:
1: Client sends password
2: Server computes hash
3: Server compares hash with one in DB
But since there is client side hashing, I figured the process on this site was more like:
1: Client sends hashed password (It's behind the scenes - the Javascript on the page computes your password hash before sending it off to the server)
2: Server compares hash with one in DB
In which case a hacker would not have to 'reverse' the hash.  All the hacker would have to do would be to send the hash directly to the server and voila!  They've got access.
That being said, TradeFortress explained above that he does double hashing.  You send your hashed password, and then he computes the hash -of- the hash itself and compares it to a database entry.  That mitigates any sort of worries that I had, anyways...

I had no idea that the Bank of Penis was so unaccepting of bitcoins!

Cool.  Thanks for the reply.

The guy seems 'legit', but don't quote me on it.  There are a few questions, however, that should be addressed...
For example: **Why are the hashes computed client side on your site(s)?**  Now the hash is acting as your password.  I surely hope you're not just storing the hash for a direct comparison in a database somewhere too... then that completely nullifies the purpose of a hash.  Hashes are meant to make it difficult for hackers to figure out passwords even if they are able to compromise a DB.
In the case of client-side hashing though, if a hacker was able to compromise the database, they'd have access to everyone's account without any effort.  They wouldn't have to break any hashes or anything because you already assume that the client computes the hash!  All they need to do is send the properly formatted POST request and they're in.
Without clarification on the security... I don't think I'd be particularly confident sending this guy money.
