I just always get confused when it comes to economics and stats. English is my second language, I really do apologize. When it comes to just algebra, geometry, I can ace it just fine.

This really is good news and I am very excited for my generation. It kind of scares me a bit though of what's going to happen in the financial sector, i.e., Wall Street.

~~Oh, I forgot about that solution, so we would just convert to another existing cryptocurrency, right? &lt;3~~ Wrong

"pool users" sorry I guess that's the technical term, BUT, I guess in my head what I was picturing was - one guy in charge of all the hardware but a group chips in for the overhead costs / capital and they just evenly split the reward - is that perfectly within the first ruling? Thank you I am learning!

Well I was leaning towards them buying huge volumes in btc, and not necessarily buy in that huge asking price *per* BTC

Thank you, madame/sir for explaining. Does this also mean a "group" miner is also fine since they only mine for each other's benefits, or does that violate the first ruling? Analogy: Group of teachers who bought a set of lottery tickets and won and split the bounty = legal. Is it fine?
Can I add you as friend? Thank you so much &lt;3

This is so cool. I guess it's in Canada? &lt;3

Could Bitcoin owners/traders also then just simply move their assets to another cryptocurrency? Will that create imbalance or something or like what will its effect be or is there even a term for that phenomenon in economics speak? Thank you so much, I am learning a lot!

My comment was alluding more to what "evil" might the corporate welfare establishment have again up their sleeves in the future and what other magic they would do besides what they have been doing in the last 5 years concealing inflation as they keep on artificially funneling money to themselves.

Thank you so very much. I apologize really for the stupid question. I'm new to this, to Bitcoin, to Reddit and Economics. I should have submitted this to ELI5 but since it's about Bitcoin, I guess I thought of putting it here instead. Thank you &lt;3

Wow I am so dumb, I conflated the first-time bitcoin investors with early adopters who already have bitcoins. Sorry, I was thinking about what if people who wanted to buy for the first time see or realize this and I guess the prices would be up. I guess they would still buy it also. I mixed everything up, you're right, I just got that.
