When you don't vote, how can you expect it to work?
@_date: 2016-08-21 14:31:50
The economic illiteracy demonstrated by those commenting is insane though. That is nothing to be proud of. My God.

I believe this is more of a begging for help than telling us about their cool completed project.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:11:44
MediaGoblin appears to be the exact same thing except further along in development...
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:08:22
You both seem to be interested in the same thing in the long run and developing openly so I suggest trying to make contact. Working together and consolidating these projects would certainly speed things along! :)
Have you heard of Hyperboria? Theres a subreddit for it If you're interested in it, more info can be found in this article:

Ah, yes, I see how it differs now. However, I'm confused about the moderator bit? Is there a central person that has power over several nodes? Because if so, Im afraid that will defeat the whole purpose of a decentralized internet.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:40:14
We can all agree about the post-PC movement towards more mobile devices. However, there are a few things very wrong with your comment. 
 First, what do you think tablets and smartphones do? If transferring data on the internet is too much for the battery of one such device, it has no place in the modern world or the future one. Almost all mobile devices are constantly downloading data from the internet wirelessly. I understand that if they were serving as a node they would be transferring a lot more data in theory, but given today's battery capacity, this still would not be an issue. 
Second, the biggest inconsistency in your theory is the reality that if we were already full on in the mobile age, then our devices battery capacity would reflect this by being able to handle data transfers. And if we are not yet in that prophesied age yet, then PC's would still abundantly abound meaning that your argument is invalid and the ideas presented here still relevant on the present.

Im sure it would be more helpful to the creators/"dreamers" if you explained the flaws in their ideas. It would actually be helpful to everyone here...
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:10:39
Why not?

Have you seen this: 
And thats not the original article I fund but it looks like the website I originally read it on is now down.
@_date: 2016-09-13 07:05:25
And what is logo's?
@_date: 2016-09-26 04:07:40
No. The comments saying otherwise clearly do not understand basic economics. For Bitcoin to be valuable it is necessary that it be used to purchase things. Without Bitcoins circulating, the Bitcoin economy will stagnate and Bitcoins will become less and less useful meaning fewer people will want it meaning its value drops. This effect compounds and is what causes economic recessions. It would be better for those bitcoins to be used to buy things repeatedly than for someone to hoard them if you are trying to help the Bitcoin economy take off.

It's unfortunate. But to me preventing social discrimination comes before economic issues.

The literal definition of right-left is based on anarchism-equality.
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:13:46
You will find a literal definition of the left-right model all over the place. Thats one of the most basic tenets of political science for centuries. It is also basic knowledge that without any social construct, there will be no sense of equality. How can you possibly believe that anarchism will lead to less violence when every single datapoint one could gather on the matter says otherwise?

They generate more money than they use. That's how it's different. Look up your own number.

What he's describing is what the Fed does. Not sure what you're getting at here.
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:49:01
Nothing except the massive negative consequences of doing so!
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:45:51
... you mine bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:59:32
If that's what you want to think of it as, then fine by me, because at least we are letting Apple know of the strong Bitcoin supporters and the number of people who are displeased.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:14:20
Hey, I hear you're like the Johnny Appleseed of bitcoin giveaways... *hint hint* *nudge nudge*
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:11:04
What were you expecting?
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:26:47
Probably on like Silk Road...
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:00:38
This is not how to solve this issue at all. I have made a post regarding how and why I think this is the wrong approach.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:31:06
So be it, but you're one of the ones seclusion gone of the largest mobile markets in the world from the Bitcoin community. 
I hope you're happy with yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:11:20
Well then thanks! I shall pursue a career in comedy!
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:54:41
Thanks, that's helpful to add to the feedback section I linked to. Would you mind of I added these things to the post?
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:58:18
Yes, this is exactly what Im getting at. The problem is, a lot of users aren't going to make the jump over this. Even those who do will not have a strong impact on Apple itself. What will impact them is telling them of the number of users that are dissatisfied with what they've done.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:51:36
I do enjoy Apple, though I wouldn't call myself a fanboy. But call me what you will.
What I stated in the title, a bit after that is that Apple makes millions upon millions of iPhone sales. You can't honestly think that they would notice even if every single Bitcoin user with an iPhone didn't buy one again! And even of that was a big dent, how would Apple know what the issue was that people were having a problem with? This goes for anything, if you have an issue with something, you can't expect it to be resolved through silence. 
Even if you don't plan on getting an iPhone again. At least tell Apple why!
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:00:32
Apple also has patents for the iSlate, the iWatch, the rock and roll Magic Mouse... I think we all know that Apple is a company known for NEVER making patents for just about every idea they come up with, long before deciding what they're going to do with it.
Plus with your logic, they're going to ban USD because it's a direct competitor with iCoins.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:42:55
Actually 2 more weeks...
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:02:38
This is a very good point. I also am displeased with the "hate Apple" mentality that has grown out of this. We shouldn't start shunning the Apple community but we should let Apple know of our dissatisfaction.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:03:16
No! I want the 71 cents!
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:48:32
I still feel like this can be nothing but sarcasm.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:40:51
See there you go, openly discriminating against Apple and their userbase which we all know is not made up of toddlers and grandparents. The more secluded we force the Bitcoin market to be stuck in, the harder it is for total adoption of the currency. I know (at least sincerely hope) that you're joking about iCoins and iWallets, but that's not true either. There is now plenty of proof that Bitcoin is legal and accepted in the US (where Apple is based) and many other countries. It's about time we use it! 
Sorry if I sound at all ranty, defensive, or aggressive, but this, I feel is an important issue that the Bitcoin community is addressing incorrectly.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:56:31


This is more than just a little bit discriminatory. 
The fact is, iOS users comprise of a huge demographic that can not just be overlooked by the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:27:05
Thats right, thats exactly what Im talking about. Here's to the Crazy Ones!
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:51:12
I whole-heartedly agree! This is not how to make a change! I made a post In this subreddit begging people to tell apple. Not buy an android.
