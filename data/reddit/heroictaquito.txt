Hopefully that backup works. Good luck!! But write that phrase down
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:50:11
Boooooo let people be excited 
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:22:36
Ooooo a green arrow
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:56:18
Don't but bitcoin through breadwallet, use an exchange. That way the bank doesn't matter
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:58:01
Electricity for it costs a lot
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:55:43
So this card just links to a coinbase bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:22:27
According to  your transaction with that fee could be waiting for 17 blocks before it is picked up
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:47:10
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:32:53
You are trying to mine a block manually? OKAAAAY I wish you the best of luck I guess??? xD
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:44:41
Honestly I would make an account on another exchange and start using that. But maybe I just like avoiding the problem 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:54:57
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:43:39
Careful with cloud mining, you generally make no money. But check out coinbase or GDAX
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:46:28
It's also been unusable for me mostly
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:59:11
Yup, just send to breadwallet address
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:37:23
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:52:17
If someone you have a channel open with has a channel open with that store then you can transact through those channels 
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:52:27
Maybe it is listed there because breadwallet gives you the option of manually connecting to a node that you wish to follow
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:34:53
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:46:00
Might as well be asking people for their private key too
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:15:21
If this was your question then yes I misunderstood and apologize 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:21:53
Remember, your coins are NOT in the wallet. Your wallet simply has the correct private key to have access to the ability to spend those coins (send them) on the block chain. Think if it as a portal to give you access to coins stored in a central bank (but that bank has copies of itself that are constantly updating scattered across a network)
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:44:32
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:39:05
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:13:08
Use an exchange such as gdax 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:30:24
Bitcoin does have a difficulty adjustment 
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:41:46
Best bet might be replacing the screen, and when you do make sure you make that backup. My phone crashed recently but I had my 12 word phrase written down :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:17:06
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:10:50
This is literally against this subreddits guidelines 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:59:24
What is the NFC chip in your hand normally for?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:29:28
Your BCH balance will always be able to be transferred out because the private keys of the wallet remain the same. Your coins will be safe, and you won't have to mess with any advanced settings, as long as you transfer out before the fork, correct. However, if you do not transfer your coins out it is not the end of the world either. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:23:48
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:55:48
Happens All. The. Time.
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:24:40
Sorry it's taking so long :/
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:06:35
I'm glad it worked!! Keep that BTC and HODL haha
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:01:21
Theoretically, couldn't one connect to a segwit node and not a segwit2x node and be fine? Or is this incorrect
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:18:33
Check out the TREZOR on amazon. It is actually being sold for MSRP
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:55:56
This is incorrect, there are 21million that can be found with the current code
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:35:06
I believe stop orders have always had fees just like market orders
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:34:47
You right. Sorry, I am far too tired to be attempting the internet
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:08:35
Different crypto algorithms are more or less susceptible to ASICS which mine much better then just raw GPU power. Look at monero and use an exchange to trade for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:41:47
Calm yoself friend
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:32:05
So you could be waiting for 22hrs from send :/ or indefinitely in which case it will be returned to your wallet after a certain amount of time 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:45:08
fortunejack is pretty well known
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:44:51
No bitcoin atms or local bitcoin options?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:28:21
what are you trying to do?
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:04:24
Nobody knowwws. But it's good for bitcoin so make your own inferences 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:05:07
3.1 x 10^-9 , please pay upfront 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:30:51
So I'm seeing a 25 sat/byte fee which is really low and could be delayed up to 133 blocks
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:29:40
Oh :(
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:44:00
They are resellers marking it up 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:21:03
Dont use faucets just buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:42:35
note that breadwallet is on that list, which is confusing 
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:08:57
Drink some more
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:17:16
It looks like the BCH rise was likely a pump and dump. Just so you are aware :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:29:49
I do not believe you can ask for bitcoin here
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:11:50
What would you recommend for SMS notifications?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:39:54
Or bitcoin atms if you have those
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:05:21
You can change the balance to be shown in bitcoin not in bits?
I didn't know this haha
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:10:51
That makes sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:43:43
It's dangerous that you are looking at buying this much without entirely understanding what a wallet is. Please do a little more research before purchasing and do not purchase all at once, stagger your purchases. Also generally a bad idea to say how much you own/intend to buy. New people interested is always great but make sure you understand the underlying principle.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:43:20
However it would be really slick to have a series of purchased coffees settle on the block chain as a single txn ;););););););)
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:13:36
Short Answer: No
This is simply when the difficulty of finding the right hash for a block is adjusted to the total mining hashpower to keep the block time at roughly 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:45:38
Is there something to say for trying to buy in the middle of the night in the US? I've noticed that is usually when the price bottoms out for a 24hr period 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:41:31
Thanks for sharing this :) 
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:20:20
Read about the lightning network
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:05:06
What app is this?
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:50:01
this was like a mini drama to read XD
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:17:31
Oh, and they are not legally obliged
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:49:53
Boo on you
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:47:03
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:03:17
The big thing about Segwit I find confusing is how are transactions verified without the use of the private key
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:09:01
What's the transaction hash?
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:19:25
Why is that
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:50:18
What's the r^2 value for this? Just out of pure curiosity 
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:59:24
wow that is some crazy luck. nice!
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:19:03
Isn't this against this subreddits rules
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:00:21
Antminer is bitmain I'm pretty sure
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:07:56
Patience friend :)
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:52:41
Buy some
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:41:03
What country are you in?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:19:02
This. This is why I love Reddit.
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:38:53
222sat/byte could be waiting 80 mins
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:07:08
Don't use online wallets at all, make sure you control the private key
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:29:51
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:51:27
You could be right. You could be wrong. Either way I just bought more.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:42:26
What are we waiting for? As in, what is the risk of sending now?
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:00:53
You don't need the same app, just one that uses BIP39 pass phrase :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:30:39
5 years older then water
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:29:44
Also, this Wednesday is SegWit activation not SegWit2x
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:26:42
I just don't like the idea of using a desktop wallet on Windows
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:54:08
Isn't this a bearish sign??
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:58:20
Why is bitcoin a hole in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:57:12
Bread is great (iOS)
mycelium is fantastic (Android)
copay I have no experience in it
Electrum is also fantastic (Android(?)/PC)
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:31:38
Shit that sucks :/
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:18:21
dammit not again
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:22:53
Is there a place to get a ledger for MSRP as opposed to mark ups though :/
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:50:16
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:50:33
This is brilliant xD
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:16:57
Also interested, but probably just volatility 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:55:14
Old addresses are always active 
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:39:17
Right now there is a grace period for mining pools to get on board and start signaling for segwit. BIP91 is locked in
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:20:35
There is on gdax if you are looking for a place like this
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:43:35
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:35:39
I'm sorry that happened to you :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:42:56
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:59:22
They recommend before 10am on July 31st it should get out in time 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:19:54
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:41:40
Did you have this custom made xD
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:57:55
Are you joking? I hope you are joking 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:49:37
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:00:11
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:49:48
Do people know there is a search bar?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:49:19
BIP91 made it so a lower percentage of blocks are required to signal for BIP141 (Segwit) for it to be activated and the grace period to set it (if I understand correctly)
