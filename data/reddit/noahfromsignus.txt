Accepting bitcoin is a great idea for any business, especially small biz.  The worst that can happen is.....nobody pays in btc, so what, but on the other hand if just one potential customer comes along and they happen to be in the position of sitting on some btc they wanna unload, and if your competetion isnt accepting it and you are...

i like gemini, its only got eth &amp; btc but theres no fee to deposit or withdraw anything unless you withdrawl more than like 10 or 20 times the same currency the same month, so basically the only fee is the .25% per trade which drops from there at high volumes.  But Ive always found pricing on Gemini to be best for buyers and if yer trying to make quick money just buy there and sell at local bitcoins for a thousand dollars more than you just bought it for or something

I think you you hit all the important steps in yer initial description.   Keeping the action offline and making sure the keys and wallet id's are exact is whats important, and you have that coverred.
i dont know about those extra special interest hardware wallets, maybe they are helpful but i dont know how much they cost or if they even give any real improvement over using offline hard/flash drives or even small/old computers w/out network connection.  Unless they are cheap, like five bucks or something, I wouldnt buy something that you can do easily for free

I didnt look at all of them but the few active ones seemed to have unreasonably high fees, even if they use accurate api's and dont charge much for conversion to spend there's still like all sorts of rediculous flat fees and %'s for every little thing.  Even some of the more expensive exchanges seem to be less costly.
i can see how these cards might make an okay gift for someone who doesnt use or really know anything about btc but for an experienced person who understands the best ways to buy, sell, &amp; use cryptos, I cant see how one of these cards would be helpful at all....
