Canada is nothing more than another state of the US.  The only real difference is the complete 100% power of the corrupt PM that doesn't give a dam if he's caught in the middle of a scandal because he controls the audits and can just whitewash them and the like.
Extraordinary lack of democracy - 38% of the vote earns you 5 years of 100% of the power.  And I mean 100%.  No senate or congress slowing things down.  Well, there is a senate, but the PM appoints them, so...
On a plus side the PM is so busy running around scandals that there is a very slim chance he would even have a the time to look into what bitcoins are.
tl;dr canada sux too.

Imagined if I bought my 386 sx with 4mb of ram by cashing out my apple stock...

except so many of the articles and videos suck so bad.
I wish some 'experts' would take the time to learn about it before writing such negative trash, rather than just reading the bullet points and and not actually understanding what is so special about it.

Bit of a keynesian circlejerk over there.

FDIC is just an insurance policy to make sure that banks don't have to pay for their idiocy.
EDIT: But we still pay, don't think we don't pay.

A deflationary currency?  Who would ever want that?  Oh no, my money is worth more than it was a while ago, what ever will I do?
So I guess I'm not going to eat any more, pay my rent or mortgage, or do anything.  Just sit around waiting for my bitcoins to appreciate.
But you say I will still spend, but I won't be incentivized to spend as much as I would with an inflationary currency?  
How is this in any way a bad thing? 
Isn't the big difference between hunter gatherers and agrarians the whole concept of saving?  Why is saving suddenly being demonized?
Why should we not live within our means?  It seems like we must spend spend spend or we are hurting our economy.  Maybe this should be considered more of an issue to be dealt with. 
tl;dr Oh no! My money has gone up in value, what ever will I do?

I will never understand why we don't just tax consumption instead.
It just seems like it would be so much easier for the irs (well, cra in my case, but same thing) to only have to deal with retailers rather than individuals.
I know, I know, hoarding.  Nobody would ever spend any money and the economy would be destroyed.
In canada we are lucky enough to have income tax and consumption tax and both federal and provincial,  lots of excise taxes and duties too.
 Seems compliance would be so much cheaper with just one tax.

because given a choice between inflationary and deflationary, I will pick inflationary?

you mean we might be building up our anti fragility?

I can't ever see liberals and ndp teaming up.  
Liberals in no way would ever have any interest in abolishing the senate.  We have too much of a culture of majority governments and the lack of belief in compromise.

Slipping away into irrelevancy.

People are too excited about finding the next bitcoin.  They feel they have missed the boat and need to figure out where the next one is going to be.
Everytime I hear people answer this question with "bitcoins might not be the one" or talking about myspace and facebook I have to roll my eyes.
If bitcoins fail then why would anyone have any interest in this new "alt coin"?  I think the public would be a little too turned off by it.
People always forget about all the infrastructure built around bitcoin.  Is bitpay going to start taking friecoins next week?  Ever? Coinbase?  All this infrastructure is going to bitcoin, and to start piling on something else is going to be a losing pile on.

And what are some restraints on the PM's power or corruption? 
Senate - likely to change, but for the better?  Most likely not.
By no means is canada another us state?  The way we use our diplomats and embassies to help the nsa spy kind of implies that we are.  
Not a bullshit 2 party puppet system?  It's even worse with the whole vote splitting thing and the lack of intelligence of the electorate.
I never said canada's government was worse than the US's, but I can't say it is any better.

Definately biased.  Over the last few years being a friend of a friend of a minister I learned a pile of stuff that I could have never imagined.  I have lost all hope for this country ever moving forward.
It's all just who's friends with who, how much money can we funnel to our buddies.
If it makes you feel any better I think the liberals and ndp would be just as bad, though not as hateful as harper.
