This is like saying you are a business if you buy stock. You aren't. 
Test for a business should be:
1. Was a business checking account used for purchase?
2. Did the business the miners were purchased for file taxes as a business?
3. Was this a business entity that purchased these miners. (LLC,LTD, ect.)

Because it really hasn't yet. Much more too it than that.

Here is the legal definition of a business as provided by case law.
This word embraces every­thing about which a person can be employed. People v. Com’ rs of Taxes, 23 N. Y. 242, 244.
That which occupies the time, attention, and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or **profit**. The doing of a **single act** pertaining to a particular business will not be considered engaging in or carrying on the business ; yet a **series** of such acts would be so considered. Goddard v. Chaffee, 2 Allen (Mass.) 395, 79 Am. Dec. 796; Sterne v. State, 20 Ala. 46.
Labor, business, and work are not synonyms. Labor may be business, but it is not necessarily so; and business is not always labor. Making an agreement for the sale of a chattel is not within a prohibition of labor upon Sunday, though it is (if by a merchant in his calling) within a prohibition upon business. Bloom v. Richards, 2 Ohio St. 387.
**The doing of a single act pertaining to a particular business will not be considered engaging in or carrying on the business ; yet a series of such acts would be so considered.**
So buying stock as a single act would not be legally considered a business. It is only a business if it is a series, basically if it is a profession. So, buying miners as a hobbyist shouldn't be considered a business with the same logic. If it is something you do quite a bit as a series of events, then you fall under a business. 
This is at least in the US. Sweden may be different.

Sounds about right.

It's important to know that KNC gave a 6 month range of when they would finish their miners. 6 months is a "huge" range to miss. They pretty much missed all of them toward the end of their consumer mining sales. With the experience they had, they should have had a good idea of when these miners would have been completed. At the pace they were going as put out by their updates, it's probable that they had no intention of even getting close to the beginning of the given range. It was just put out to get people to buy miners or deceive them. Which is fraud.

Unfortunately the better attorney's want money upfront. I should say the better attorney's can afford to be a little more demanding up front.
