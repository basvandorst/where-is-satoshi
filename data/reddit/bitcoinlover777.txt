Ok, good to know. I sure hope it doesn't get refunded because I'll have to send it again. :(

Ah, I see. If it's 170 satoshi per byte wouldn't it be 35-1200 minutes based on that chart?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:34:15
Good to know. It'll eventually arrive though right?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:09:28
Man, thanks a ton. I feel way better knowing it should arrive within 20 hours than not knowing anything at all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:51:20
How large of a fee do you usually pay?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:32
Ah, interesting. So some transactions are filtered out? I assumed all transactions should be visible. Do you know what the criteria is that blockchain.info uses for filtering out transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:11:48
I'm a little paranoid about this stuff so forgive me if I don't. haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:32
Where can I check the bytes and will it eventually arrive?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:06:40
Yeah, I've been waiting 11 hours! Based on the helpful guy that provided the fee vs transaction time chart, it sounds like mine is going to take 20 hours max. :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:31:26
This is really helpful. Where can I check the bytes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:34:17
This is a great answer. Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:43:22
I found the bytes. It's 1788 bytes. Is the fee provided too low? I'm having a hard time interpreting the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:14:10
Oh you're right. It changed again to 35 to infinity. :( Is there any way I could pay more now to get it delivered faster?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:45:49
The fee paid is 0.00305032 BTC ($56 USD) and the byte size was 1788 bytes. Is that a reasonable fee? I didn't actually pick the fee. The exchange where I bought it from did.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:36:40
Is there a way to accelerate the delivery by paying a higher fee while in transit?
