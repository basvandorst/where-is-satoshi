can I ask, how do you intend to get rid of that many coins?

what is margin?

eli5 how is this likely to affect bitcoin value
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:44:24
they only accept wire transfer for funding, that's kindof inconvenient
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:42:59
ikr i've had bitcoin for more than A WEEK and I am STILL not a millionaire wtf reddit
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:27:03
then the "maximum" number of bitcoins will keep decreasing under 21M. won't that have a reverse inflation effect?

whats the halvening did the price drop?&gt; ahhh
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:21:35
I think he meant 3999 and less
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:20:38
2020 50k
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:16:53
that's what I was talking about, this one also has an impressive amount of negative reviews  they are all like that, it makes researching very frustrating.

"Buy the dips" and "Never try to time the market" are polar opposites, no?
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:31:44
either that OR they will realise they are unable to trade crypto for real money which, being realistic, is what most hodlers are ultimately after.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:52:31
thats not what a strawman is.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:58:21
if anything it's an incentive to buy more
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:15:52
realistically 10k, optimistically 50k.
although I must admit if you had asked me a few months earlier, I would have said 5k max so who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:33:28
I think a key term here is "cautiously optimistic". of course it's a gamble. of course it can bleed out or even crash. don't spend what you are unwilling to lose etc. etc. 
after all that it is still a gamble that largely favors the player. (imo ofc)

isn't the supply NOT decreasing, but increasing at half the speed?

coinbase is a company that holds a lot of bitcoin. when you set up an account with them, you are never holding your bitcoin, you just have an account that says they owe you that much. I suspect that through all their users, they owe more bitcoin than they have (like banks do).
what you should do is go to accounts -&gt; send and enter the address of a wallet you actually own. it can be a hardware wallet if you've done your research or a desktop wallet such as electrum from electrum.org
of course when moving bitcoin from an exchange to a wallet, make a dummy trasanction first to make sure you set it up right.

I, too, would like it to shoot to the moon but a number like that just isn't realistic. At that value 21M bitcoins would total 10 trillion dollars. the total GDP of the world is 100 trillions.

we have these in montreal! but they have a high % fee. still, it's an excellent gateway for beginners.

I guess he could make daily transactions in an online exchange, and only actually move the coins once he gets to a certain volume, like once every other week.
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:00:44
it's a store of value like... money?
