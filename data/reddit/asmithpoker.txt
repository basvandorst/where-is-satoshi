You don't have enough experience in looking for hookers it sounds like cuck.  They are litterally everywhere on social media and porn sites.  Also it takes almost no effort from the sites to find these pages with a scraping tool.  They are all doing it in one way or another.  I didn't know Bp isn't paying taxes as you said in your last post(to me thats fcked).  Nothing should come from this except an eye opener for the doj to end this stupid stunt and make prostitution legal country wide.

I'm not a of underage pros either mate.  We can def agree on that.  I normally err on the side of caution when someone says someone is underage based on looks.  I looked 15 for the majority of my 20s.

You are a cuck.  Bp isn't anything different then following hookers on xhamster and talking about hooking up with them.

Yeah your right.  It was a different user that mentioned taxes.  Yes I know it was the state's attorneys office.  I had to many threads open and just miss spoke.  5hrs sleep will do that to you.  Doesn't change what I meant though.  This shit shouldn't be illegal and we shouldn't be wasting any resources like on shit like this. Regulate and tax please. It also doesn't change that everyone is profiting off of these hookers in either traffic or actual payments.
