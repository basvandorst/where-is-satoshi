100% NOT

The volume figures, are those of people in China moving their BTC to LBC? If so, are they trying to withdraw (as all the C exchanges won't let them draw down in CNY)?

Ah, thanks :)

Looks cool.
TLDR: how do we set our sk on the rings? Would you have to know the sk?

Staking won't be available to everyone, only 200 pos holders, and these seats will cycle every year (last time I looked into this)

Easier to cash out?
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:44:15
And miners, I mine alts, eth and zec mainly, the only way (that I've found) to cash out as fiat is to exchange to BTC first.

You looked at localbitcoins.com?  Not exchange based per say, buying from others. You'll struggle to find legitimate sources that won't need ID confirmation (passport photo etc) IMO

IMO ETH was cool when the concept was strongly the ability to run smart contracts in the massive compute power of its mining network. After all its infighting and fork after fork, and attacks, and some other drama, and this BS about switching to POS (proof of stake) with a limited number of expiring POS holders a year... I lost interest in the future of ETH.

Depends on the timeframe involved in building up the cash...
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:02:16
Good point on decreasing difficulty!
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:23:04
Kinda like if you didn't have a backup of your private key...
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:54:02
Depends on how long the "troubles" lasted far, and what "we" had learnt from it all. FIAT would probably not be the best way to go if we were starting from scratch again. There's no guarantee that we'd look to BTC, but the "age effect" would come into play no doubt, it's been around the block.
This is all silly speculation anyway, but the uber wealthy can afford the time to speculate on silly things.

You should just be able to treat the BTC/XBT as any other currency, so you need accounting software that can support multiple currencies.  We used to use XERO and Quickbooks before that, managing income and expenses in GBP, USD.
We now use an in-house platform our devs built, which handles GBP, USD, and BTC/XBT - but they didn't have to do anything specifically different to allow the handling of BTC, they simply treated it as "just any other currency".
Have you tried one of the existing multi-currency packages out there?

Sauce: 
In this day and age, it baffles me when we see large cash raids like this.  Isn't it the general public consensus that BTC is mainly used in criminal activity... interesting that we see so many of these types of cash raid pics then.  Guess its a good headline grabber.
The criminal underground still has much to learn about bitcoin... how do we market and grow awareness?  Hmm perhaps a "store your loot in bitcoin, so you don't have piles of cash under your mattress" udemy course is needed...
(in case you weren't sure - this isn't a serious post/comment)

Sorry to hear your woes, thanks for sharing this story, as a seller on LBC myself, it's a reminder to trade safely.
I tend to only sell using direct deposit (UK) with trusted buyers, those with 1000s of transactions, who are clearly trading BTC for a living.
Good luck man, 10 BTC is quite a hit!

To expand on this... I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has used Purse with Amazon UK and PRIME... wondering how US centric it is (probably a lot at this stage?)
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:00:25
Er... I didn't read that whole long post. 
The mining comment from is somewhat valid... you've assumed that mining is purely how *bitcoin is made*.
Without miners there's no one to validate the blockchain, and thus transactions, and thus you can't transact. 
This is all, for the most part, a thought exercise in any case.

From a strictly accounting perspective, the fluctuations between pairs doesn't *really* matter.  You're typically looking at or reporting your numbers based on a timeframe, and when converting to your base currency, it would be based on the exchange rates (of any pairs) at the point in time you're running your query.
Multi currency accounting systems have to normalise back to a base currency, as you don't report your accounts in USD and XBT, just like we don't report in GBP, USD, and XBT - when its filing/tax time we have to look at everything in GBP.
What are you trying to track/account for?  It might be outside the scope of what a *normal* accounting package can do.
I've had this back and forth with our accountant many times, as he always feels that I want too much information logged in our accounting system, but I don't want to have data replicated in different systems, which is why we ended up building our own :)
I'm not an accountant or financial professional, this is based on my experience having built, scaled, and sold a number of businesses in my time.

I don't know if its a mainstream vs not mainstream argument... more aptly, its probably, "people who pay attention to developments in the world" vs "people who are conformists (what they'd call *normal*)".  IMHO.
What question level was it?
