You realize the banking industry spends billions of dollars annually on security? Not only engineering controls but fraud managers, live humans actively evaluating transactions. 
You're completely overlooking the amount of thought and active effort that keeps the banking industry from being susceptible to this sort of stuff.

This is actually good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:33:27
tether has been used to prop up the price of bitcoin. bitcoin is probably 20% above where it would be without tether.
expect to see a massive correction in btc price if tether is forced to shut down operations. if not a collapse.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:39:50
i dont see how this cant be good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:53:44
The price of bitcoin has been propped up numerous times recently due to bitfinex issuing new tether.
Let that sink in for a minute, Bitcoin's price is being artificially inflated when more tether is issued. The price is no longer reflecting actual demand.
What happens when bitfinex decides its all too risky or whatever, stops issuing more Tether. No more crutches, bitcoin price drops rapidly, how far? who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:40:46
ok but isn't bitfinex also accumulating a serious amount of bitcoins in exchange for tether.
is it enough to influence btc price at bitfinex discretion?

@_date: 2018-01-25 12:30:25
bitcoins allright, but you really should stay aware of how many tethers are being issued. something going wrong with tether will cause a crash in BTC price

That's not what you're doing though. You're not asking, you're acting like they already do accept bitcoin, then trying to get them to think they're crazy because they don't know some false reality you're trying to portray. What you're doing is called gaslighting and it's a real asshole thing to do, in case you're unaware.
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:19:42

did you know $3.4 &gt; 0.
the point im trying to make here, anytime you consider you're equivalent profits/losses over time with crypto you have to factor in the fact the exchange you likely have all your coins on, can exit scam you.
there is 0 chance of that happening with a bank.

10. The Monitor’s preliminary investigation identified the following principal concerns which it believes contributed to the current situation facing Quadriga and its Users:




its available infrastructure, Quadriga does not appear to have had visibility into its profitability, if any;


containing User Funds and or properly recorded;


location and security passwords associated with Quadriga’s Fiat and
Cryptocurrency inventories between TPPs, bank accounts, wallet addresses and third-party exchanges. In addition, the Monitor understands passwords were held - 7 - by a single individual, Mr. Cotten and it appears that Quadriga failed to ensure adequate safeguard procedures were in place to transfer passwords and other critical operating data to other Quadriga representatives should a critical event materialize (such as the death of key management personnel);

multiple times over the past 10 years bitcoin has crashed over 80% in value.
if you are proposing an asset as a safe place to store your wealth, would you recommend an asset that has steadily risen 683 percent over 13 years. Or one that has had wild swings in both directions in that time period.
there is a fundamental difference in comparing assets that go up steadily over time and those that jump and crash repeatedly. one requires you simply get in. the other requires you get in at the right time.

should the government to step in and force platforms to accept him? that's the total opposite of what bitcoin stands for.
paypal isn't a right, it was created privately. it also faces competition. no business should be forced to deal with the backlash and boycotts that come with hosting undesirable people, because the government forces them to.
imagine you create something awesome, and because of it's success, the government seizes control over it. that would set america back decades, and make us a laughing stock.
lets not conflate bitcoin and nationalizing tech.

lots of places are introducing legislation to ban cashless. it's discriminatory against the poor, it's a trend that will be abolished.

i thought the whole point of bitcoin was that it was decentralized and outside of government regulation.
but mentioning legal action is implying you want a regulatory body to restore your funds.
you're a hypocrite.

to hit $20k again the general public has to get involved and believe in bitcoin again. a coin that's lost 80% this year.
bitcoin will never hit $20k again, theres a few pump and dumps left before it becomes a novelty for a few bucks.

because apparently noone has confidence in a bitcoin price over $1000

the general public wont give bitcoin another shot till it reaches $50,000. thats a long time to pump for it to get traction again imo.
