I got my first dog from a pet store, and I too wasn't then aware of where they get these dogs from and the conditions they are subjected to. Me and my fiancee spent almost $1,200 USD on a little toy poodle only to take it home to the dog having seizures. He started walking into to walls too! It was terrible. We took him to several vets, including an emergency vet ($$$). We had to force feed the poor little guy food and sugar just to keep him alive. At some point we just knew he was going to die, but we tried even still. All while getting the run around from the store and their staff. This dog ended up having a liver shunt and died just weeks after we got him. We realized after, this dog was FOR SURE sick before we ever bought him, and they sold it to us anyways. Fucked up on so many levels! We had to jump through so many hoops, between calling the store, going to speak with managers at the store, calling corporate...it was not a fun experience. Quite heartbreaking actually. Finally got our money back after threatening legal action, and getting a big right up in our cities main newspaper.

I assumed this was common knowledge amongst the crypto crowd.

It must be on coinbase or it didn't happen.
