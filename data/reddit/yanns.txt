I like the constant flow of coins from person to person via tips, it's really cool in my opinion.

I wonder what CBS news will think of this in 20 years or so.

Great video and fair treatment. I hope for more media exposure soon.

Yeah, I see this cycle going on for a few more years until true stabilization has occurred.

Thanks to both and @_date: 2013-10-22 00:11:29
So glad that I invested in it around the crash, my bitcoins are worth significantly more now.

I'm glad with all of the publicity BTC is getting because of the SR shutdown, I really think it will be good for the currency in the long run.

Why would somebody give Gold to and not me :p It's a bot!
@_date: 2013-10-01 19:09:17
Okay, its registered! I was a bit confused because the bot didn't reply as I have seen it usually do
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:58:43
I have withdrawn from my account, how long should it take to register?
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:50:37
If this is legit, I'm so glad I used a throwaway email and a random password.

Question How exactly shall me receiving the tip in my address work?
@_date: 2013-10-01 23:13:37
Ah, okay.
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:00:53
I kinda wish that I set up on blockchain.info now :/
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:52:34
No problem, I appreciate you helping out a newb in need.
@_date: 2013-09-30 21:47:25
Thank you! I'm so glad with how friendly this community is.

Wait, was he wearing sunglasses during the exchange? If so, that's very fishy.
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:23:24
Can the guy who made the bot then transfer the gold to his main account?
