Iota is one of the worst examples you could have given for "better tech"
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:16:32
answer above

We should all be switching to segwit

There was a crackdown on crypto meet ups last year, so they weren't open and legal for a time.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:54
it means we're in a bubble.

Not to be a stickler, but it's pronounced "you-un" (easiest anglosounds I can think of), not similar to "when"

Anywhere, yeah you can still use physical cash, but you could just use alipay and wechat. You could live in buttfuck nowhere and as long as someone has a phone they can accept wechat or alipay. You can literally buy anything with it.
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:43:40
It's definitely wechat or alipay, I lived without physical cash in China for the past two years - even the rinky dink stalls on top of remote mountains will have a qr code to scan so you can use wechat or alipay. It's pretty sweet. A bit misleading to post this gif here, crypto is only for speculating and scamming people (via ICOs) in China.

I always interpret the phrase "not to be a _____" to mean "I'm about to be a ________, but I'm sorry about it"

Google drive? Why you're at it why not chuck it on evernote? That's always a good idea.

You didn't, dude just thinks every girl in Vietnam is a hooker or something.
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:45:11
0, no fees and it's accepted everywhere, everyone has an account. I even buy and sell my crypto through alipay and wechat.

Architecture? You're fucked if thats your skill too, pretty useless
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:33:06
As a former architecture major, I can agree with some of those points, but a structural engineer would also have a (and probably have a much stronger) knowledge of material science.
Architects are glorified designers, which I find useless in the situation mentioned, their value is extremely limited. I would find an economist more valuable than an architect.

You're dreaming if you think that.

He doesn't know, if he knew he'd be on an island somewhere, not making snarky comments on a bitcoin shitpost

TA is a reflection of market sentiment. It isn't a crystal ball it's a tool to interpret market movements. TA can also be interpreted differently, thus why sometimes one persons' TA might be bullish and anothers' is bearish.
**Edit:** Idiots downvoting me who have no basic understanding of FA, TA or EMH. If you don't know how to use a tool then obviously that tool (TA) would seem useless to you, but saying it's crap is pretty asinine. BTW, downvote isn't a disagree button...one of the reasons these crypto subs are a bunch of circle-jerks these days.
**Here's some research you can look into:**

Haha, nice one.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:24:07
Me too, I got paid on the 28th, and it already rebounded by then 
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:40:36
That wouldn't have been a bad move if you bought back when it was 3-5k
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:22:32
sell low? Buy high? The coins were essentially free from the fork and he sold when BCH is reaching highs...what are you smoking?
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:44:37
I can do that now with my crypto card. There's a few crypto card projects out there that work alright.

If you've traded for a long time, you'd know you're more likely to get rekt then continue to earn $. Yeah 2% increase today, but probs -15% tomorrow.
Are you sure you "know how to trade"?

As someone else said, the cypherpunk days are bitcoin are gone, many have joined for the speculation. Bitcoin is "mainstream" (for lack of a better word), and those are mainstream opinions.
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:09:02
sillly. Someone's savings, who bought earlier this year, would hardly be safe and secure.
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:02:35
Man, that's all I could see too. It's very unsettling.
