I got verified, but I haven't completed the two factor because they want me to print out the qr code. Haven't got to it yet. Took a couple days to get there.

Its a recovery term. When I get run over by a train it isn't the last link of the train that kills me, it's the first. I.e "if only I hadn't had that last shot last night I wouldn't have blacked out, got a dui, and been arrested (or worse.)" Its akin to saying if only I'd got off the tracks before the caboose ran me over I'd still be alive. The premise maintains that avoiding the first drink entirely (the engine) I don't have to worry about the rest of the train (the caboose.) If, as the original author posited, that his life is better because of Bitcoin (which I can attest it is) but he is still drinking, then the suicidal thoughts and hopelessness he experiences are almost as certain to return as surely as Bitcoin is bound to go up. It is a statistic of alcoholism that is more common than not.

I was just like you, I pounded my fist on the table during an alcohol course that I needed to pass to get my license back, declaring it was my "right" as an American to Drink. I did, for another three years in fact, got my license back too. Also got another dui at the  end of it. They told me what I needed to hear, I wouldn't listen. I'm not trying to convince you one way or another. All I know is if you aren't ready to stop drinking one day at a time there is nothing I can say to make you decide otherwise, but if you have decided enough is enough and you are sick and tired of being sick and tired, then I don't have to worry about saying the right or wrong thing because there is no wrong thing to say.

It isn't the caboose that kills you, it's the engine.

It sounds like a good improvement. Suicidal thoughts are terrible. If you are willing to give it a try, not drinking helps. There is always another jackpot (big drunk) on the horizon for us alcoholics.

How did you get .089 for $150? You must be missing a 0 somewhere.

Why did you enter my consciousness with this concept and then later this night I read about the strange loop in Robert Anton Wilson's Schrodinger's cat trilogy? Why is this always happening to me?!!!!!
