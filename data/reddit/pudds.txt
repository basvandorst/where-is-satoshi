Wikipedia should stop begging for money when its rich as fuck.

Still much more common for general office work as well.
Really the only desktop space that windows doesn't still dominate is multimedia.

Reddit is as good or as bad as you make it.  If your version is a shit hole, then you're subscribed to the wrong subreddits.

Not true, I have a 6 digit pin on my TD visa and bank card.  My Chase (Amazon.ca) card only lets me use 4 digits though.

It was definitely needed.

Why are you picking on Microsoft here?  According to the documents, they basically turned everything into spyware.

T.O. came way before Tdot (which is just a lame shortening of "T dot O dot").

I paid $3 to move $100 last week and it took something like 16 hours.

HTML renderers ignore the spaces, actually, unless your input source encodes the second space.

It's dated 2014, so probably exactly the same chart.

Whatever the value is in USD.  If it gets high enough, I'll likely cash out.  For now, since I don't have much, I just hold or use it for occasional online transactions.

The question was "what is the US Dollar backed by?"

They're close, IMO - what they're after is the idea of using Bitcoin in everyday life without conversions.
What they should have said is: "It will be mainstream when you can buy your groceries with it."
And I don't mean with a bitcoin debit card that automatically converts to the local currency.  I mean when I can go in, see the price in bitcoin and not have to do the conversion in my head.

That's the problem, we probably never will.
Until some country does though, Bitcoin is basically just a currency that's foreign for everyone.

Only if you're doing cash advances or have a card that charges annual fees.

Bout the same as in here tbh.

The average person doesn't have nearly enough available cash in a bank account for this kind of protest to come anywhere near a level that would impact a big bank.

The term should die, it makes Bitcoin look like a joke.

So many people in here talking about hiding money from their spouses in case of divorce.
An attitude like that is HOW you end up divorced, people.  If you're so convinced that you're going to be part of the 50% that gets divorced that you're planning out a way to make sure you come out ahead, then you might as well not bother at all.
Marriage is a partnership.  The only chance you have is honesty.

It's supposed to be pretty good for you - I have a co-worker who's been doing it for several years now.
I tried it for a couple months a while back and found it too hard and distracting.  I was constantly aware of how uncomfortable I was, and had trouble getting into the zone as a result.
Some day I plan to build or buy an adjustable setup, I think that would be the ideal.  I could sit for the majority of the day, then bring things up and stand during meetings and other non-coding scenarios.

Do you use a stand-up desk? I have one monitor vertical as well, but I find it too tall and it's hard on my neck.

Considering how expensive and difficult it is to use for every day transactions, it's more of an investment for most people than it is a currency.

Here's a mirror for when this inevitably disappears:


OP, linking to 4chan isn't a good idea, the threads don't last very long.
