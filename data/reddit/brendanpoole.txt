I got into bitcoin because I heard an interview between Julian Assange and Eric where Eric knew nothing about it when Julian said hed invested wikileaks money into it.  He's obviously learned about it since then! ;)

Disconnect from internet before starting machine. Fire up electrum, create transaction and sign it offline. Copy transaction file to pen drive and import it into electrum running on a cleanly installed pc. Instructions will be on Google.

Disagree, unless you keep your Linux box disconnected from the internet, a trezor is far more secure.

Also setup an additional passphrase that you don't write down but can remember and tell your family. That way even if seeds words stolen, they would need to brute force passphrase.

$pkg update
$pkg install openssl
on laptop...
(ssh -p 8022 &lt;phone's ip&gt;)
$pkg install proot
$pkg install git
$git clone 
$cd termux-ubuntu
$apt-get update
$apt-get install wget
$wget 
$tar xzvf bitcoin-0.18.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
$cd bitcoin-0.18.0/bin
$./bitcoind -prune=550
