Those credit card signs are usually handed out by the major banks associated with them. This is an individual business! I don't keep up to date with those who purchase so I'm not aware of their business sales, thats between them and their business! :D Over 300 signs have been distributed globally; yes the Litecoin signs are entirely sold out. [There was only a short run going]( which have all been fully claimed. Only a few were interested and it ended up not being worth the time to go forth with a real production.

Apologies for the potato quality picture. My DSLR camera charger was apparently stolen by lemmings. Enjoy! :)

Yeah, I have a lot of WoT on OTC, thanks. Glad to hear it'll be able to be transferred over.

Unfortunately not. There are so many countries with different standards it's almost impossible to keep up with them all. However, any power adapter should work as long as it's reputable!

This summer it's been a bit slow (which is expected, as everything Crypto seems to run a bit slower than normal around this time of the year), however other than that they've been awesome!

We've actually gotten a few orders just for Hobby rooms. They can easily light up a 300sq ft wo(man) cave!

Great job on missing the point. To the Moon jokes are as old as Casascius coins as photo references.

Hey platonic,
The best method would to bring it to a local repair shop. They will be able to trace the original piece and the fitting associated with it and make you a new one. You can de attach the segment that got busted and leave the rest home. Just unplug it, take off the rubber boots, and disconnect the coils; you'll be good to go!
Upfront downside: Not sure what their cost will be. Each place is different and costs fluxuate depending on the size and design stuff.

This video game has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

If you have any questions at all please feel free to ask, I'm sure the community will do their best to help. But, do some research first, and ask questions later. It is the best method for confirming which information is actually confusing and which is understood the most. Good luck yo!

Bring on the hate, but you can blame the merchants and adoption process for the lack of buy pressure. With services like Bitpay, they are allowing merchants to immediately convert directly to fiat which is not helping the digital economy whatsoever. They are just putting the coins back in circulation since they are not holding or respending them elsewhere, and the demand for coins isn't rising due to the never ending cycle. If more companies held onto their BTC and spent it instead of trading it immediately for fiat, you'd have an entirely different outcome.

So.. theres always the issue of scammy buyers online claiming they've never received a product they've paid for at an attempt for freebies, and the seller always gets screwed. What actually protects a seller from a scummy buyer in Open Bazaar? How does it protect our money as honest merchants, and how can we defend our feedback?

I feel like there's room for abuse here, yeah? The first thing I asked myself was, well, what if the person you pick as third party is also your friend? Lastly, is there a specific area to sign up to act as a dispute resolution agent in regards to being a third party multi sig holder? Or is that part of the whole signup process? Thanks for your response.

Don't trust an exchange. Only trust yourself. Get a Trezor or Ledger Nano S hardware wallet direct from manufacturer. Dont risk hot wallets on online computers period.

Does anyone in this thread have a photo of the still from the film? I'd love to see it. I saw the movie but apparently I wasn't fast enough to catch it.
