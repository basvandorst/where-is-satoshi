Sure. But FSF doesn't like Open Source either. ;)

Nah, it's $3.50.

Tor and encryption is there already. Terrorism and children.

Pretty far. Language is not set in stone, it's an evolving thing.
But really, marriage as we have it is just government giving you paper and having a couple of stuff be different, like taxes and stuff.
A while back there was no governmental marriage. You were pretty much married if you lived together. Here are some wikipedia passages:




So many who live together now would pretty much have been considered married back then.

Not just that it's impossible to predict, it's breaking records all the time, so this far it has been a good buy at any time.

Didn't that happen already? Mine are confirmed, which they were not when I got the wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:38:37
If you have to ask, you probably shouldn't be trading like that.

Does this mean I should not dump my BCH yet? And btw, where can I? ViaBTC doesn't take signups apparently at the moment.

System probably makes it dollars immediately and is just for another way to pay.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:28:13
Don't you need something to immediately show you they have paid, though? Do you have to log in to your wallet every time. "Yeaa, wait a bit, I'll input the password to this wallet that holds hundreds of bitcoins so I can see you actually paid first."

I wouldn't ever buy at all time high. :D

Certain someone triggers some Americans these days. :D

The best time to sell is before the quantum computing really comes. :p

I thought we were talking about bitcoin.

You will not be unsuccesfull in selling unless you have a set price. Someone will pay something I bet.

Slowpoke.jpg? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:39:22


Sure. But this far it always has.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:23:10
Didn't they say there is a dip first? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:23:09
It's not profitable if you sell immediately. If you sell in a year, what matters is the price then, not the current price.
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:40:01
Of course by set price, I meant something like "not gonna go lower than this" and thus being unsuccessful I meant not being able to sell because you were not willing to go where market goes...

What... What is thia november thingy?
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:36:29
I would not. I exchanged my doges to btc today.
