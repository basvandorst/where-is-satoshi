This is explained in the article.

How does increasing the value actually help the movement? How is Bitcoin as a currency actually more useful if the price is $1000 rather than $1?
@_date: 2016-09-07 03:25:08
This is the exactly the first thing anyone studying encryption is told to absolutely never do. And yet many people do anyway, resulting in them being owned. Encryption is hard, you will mess up. Even if you get the theory right (ha!, not very likely), you will mess up an implementation detail.
Use published, well-audited encryption software, i.e. popular open-source software. Even if this has been broken, an attacker will be very hesitant to show their hand by using the exploit. It would be kept highly secret, which means very rarely using it, let alone using it to produce evidence in court, begin police investigations, etc.
If your goal is extreme paranoia, the only solution is one-time-pads.
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:50:32
Er, how does having currency tied up by hoarders add liquidity?
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:49:56
But the Bitcoins being horded are not available for transactions.
That whole reasoning doesn't follow, anyway. No one is trying to do transactions using a sizable chunk of the entire Bitcoin supply.
@_date: 2015-04-27 04:38:25
Seriously, get help. This is an addiction, not unlike a gambling addiction, and you have a problem.
If you don't trust the dollar, I get it. But this is not the solution. Bitcoin is an experimental and highly volatile asset. If you were thinking rationally, you would invest in a diverse set of assets. Gold, stocks, real estate, etc.
But you are not thinking rationally. So please, sell your bitcoin, put your money into a nice safe fund managed by someone else, and get help.
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:47:29
A lot of people here hold Bitcoins and are thus very inclined to say that anything which increases the value is a good thing. Just saying.
I think there are two things which actually help "support the movement":
* Getting Bitcoin accepted as a means of payment at more places.
* Stabilizing the value.
We're clearly not going to effect the first of these by holding Bitcoin, so that's out. But *spending* Bitcoin will help with that, so it's worth keeping that in mind. You certainly never want to pass up an opportunity to make a transaction using Bitcoins.
Holding Bitcoin can help stabilize the price, as long as you stubbornly hold it for the long-haul and do not sell whenever the market starts to take a bit of a dive. It won't do much, so I really wouldn't inconvenience yourself much to do it, but it will do some.
@_date: 2011-02-22 22:26:01
This is a common problem; the spam filter is terrible. gets massive numbers of false positives every day. It's made worse by the tiny number of correct positives. We really don't need a spam filter at all :/
@_date: 2011-06-18 08:33:02
True, but the op's specific situation was one in which the difference *is* significant. He wants to move data between two trusted machines (desktop and laptop) by means of an untrusted machine (Dropbox). Save the keys on both machines but not on the Dropbox and everything is set.
The difference is indeed tiny. But I don't trust Dropbox at all (no traffic encryption, free service), so I'm pretty much assuming that data is compromised. The laptop and desktop, on the other hand, are unlikely to be compromised through anything but theft, which gives the user time to move the money. So the complete protection from dictionary attacks on the Dropbox data is decently significant.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:02:07
I would advise switching to pgp for encryption. This way if your dropbox (or the traffic going to/from it) is compromised the attacker will have to crack a private key (not at all feasible) rather than a password (potentially doable).
This is a rather minor concern, but it doesn't really require any additional effort or anything.
@_date: 2011-08-01 04:29:03
It seems to me that it would be quite easy for the pools to skim an extra 2% off without anyone noticing.
@_date: 2011-03-29 20:04:35
There is no way to see all the transactions performed by an ip address. Yes, the transactions are public knowledge. But there is no way to link them all to either of the parties involved.

Couldn't agree with this more.
And because of that: What is this service? I could use a Mumble server. I'm probably going with a vps, but I might be interested in your service.

It doesn't necessarily have to be intentional. His machines could be compromised, etc.
@_date: 2011-06-26 03:51:39
I don't even know where the analogy links up here...
Are you blaming users for having passwords which could be quickly brute-forced from the hashes?
@_date: 2011-05-19 05:48:00
... Or just encrypt it?
Also, that wouldn't necessarily help-- someone eavesdropping on your Internet connection would pick up all the emails (assuming they aren't going out and in through ssl).
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:10:29
Even 40% is far too high, imo. That means that just a few pools need to be compromised or run by the same person to destroy the network.
@_date: 2011-06-18 00:25:54


Uh, sure. This does not inspire confidence at all. 
If you do not get insurance this is going to be a joke.


Ditto here. Are you going to use [strong authentication]( or a bunch of "security" pictures and sounds like my bank does?
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:48:16
Your suggestion would only work if you never plug the USB stick back into the potentially compromised computer. The malware could simply grab the contents of the stick and send them to the attacker as soon as you do so. I guess it could work decently if you only do so when you are about to spend them though, and it may provide some security through obscurity.
The only simple solution here is to simply not allow your btc computer to be compromised. A bit of effort here could go a long way. Run a good Linux or BSD distro (Debian stable would be an excellent choice), don't run potentially exploitable services (eg ssh). If you have as much money as this guy did you may wish to not use it for anything but Bitcoin and keep it offline when not needed. Encryption would help as well, but remember that physical security is crucial-- all passwords can be bypassed by a simple hardware keylogger. You may even want to store this computer and its keyboard in a bank vault.
Alternatively, pay someone else to do it for you. I don't know if any such services exist yet, but I expect they will soon. The service could use something like [Yubikeys]( and/or [PGP]( for authentication and/or call you before allowing large transfers to go through. The service provider may even be able to take responsibility for any fraudulent withdrawals, much as regular banks do. The problem, of course, is that you need to trust the service provider.
@_date: 2011-08-02 04:40:12
Fair enough. But I think it would be good to state this in the faq, if nothing else simply to avoid "where are my btc" panics.
@_date: 2011-05-27 16:16:02
This is exactly why this whole thing won't be happening any time soon.
@_date: 2011-08-02 04:03:15
Just ordered some btc. The order was easy enough, but payment seems to be a bit slow. In fact, it has yet to show up.
I'll update when I get my btc, or you can check yourself:
EDIT: I want to trust this, but I'm going to have to suggest DO NOT USE THIS STORE until this is cleared up. Even if it is just a technical issue, it could be resulting in the owner selling more than he or she has.
Of course, if there is money in the address above when you read this you can safely ignore this warning.
EDIT: **Everything's shiny.** And a second email was sent to me when the btc were delivered.
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:54:31
I really fail to see why anyone even cares about the consistency of payouts. It's not like anyone is relying on this for income (I hope).
@_date: 2011-06-15 05:46:36
The bitcoin client cannot possibly be secure unless the computer itself is. I worry that all built-in encryption will do is give users a false sense of security, as it defends against little more than simple physical access attacks, and such attacks could easily be modified to work even with the encryption (eg install malware while you have physical access). Granted, this is useful; but it would not have helped the person in the forums post and it is far less effective than even something as simple as FDE.
EDIT: It's probably worth pointing out that FDE+wallet encryption would be an excellent idea. A common concern with FDE is that someone could still wipe your disk and replace it with a compromised, password-grabbing OS. Hopefully the users would notice this before getting all the way to entering their wallet password.
@_date: 2011-04-12 02:07:14
The transaction is for 400 kbtc. That's a lot of money.

@_date: 2011-06-15 15:37:53
Hardware keylogging, perhaps. But if your computer is compromised mouse movements can be tracked.
@_date: 2011-05-19 00:47:11
More importantly, it just happens to fluctuate at approximately the same rate against all of these currencies. They are pretty solid compared to btc. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 22:44:30
Will you be at all disappointed and wish your had sold if it stabilizes at $20 and, in real terms (adjusted for inflation of the USD), stays there for the rest of your life? ie, are you expecting to make money off of the increasing value of the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:10:39


The Mt. Gox people really should, at the very least, inform the user that they need to use better passwords :/
@_date: 2011-05-19 00:33:24
It is if you consider it security.
And this doesn't even obfuscate anything unless you identify file types by file extension.
@_date: 2011-07-25 05:34:42

I have no experience/knowledge of/with pools, but:
Getting a higher income from one pool than with the others is sketchy. How/why are the operators doing this? More reason not to allow it to get too large.
@_date: 2011-06-26 04:47:19
This level of paranoia is absurd. High-profile servers are running every day without suddenly becoming compromised. And these servers actually have a need to run networking applications, the most likely ones to have significant security holes.
Being compromised requires either buggy software or a user error (configuration, etc). As long as you know what you are doing and use good and stable software, there is no significant risk. If you have a lot of money stored it may be wise to use a separate machine for Bitcoin and general use, but never connecting the machine to the internet is *far* more trouble than it is worth.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:33:29
Helps, yes. But a standard pgp key is 256 bits. That's something to the order of 10^77 possible keys. They private key is generally stored in encrypted form, so the attacker needs to both have that key and have/be able to crack your passphrase.
You also have the option of taking advantage of pubic keys, which allow you to encrypt data without having access to they private keys needed to decrypt it. You could, for example, have a private key stored only in physical secure locations and encrypt data with it from your physically insecure laptop.
@_date: 2011-08-01 14:17:21
An amount this small would not be visible in the image, and I'm betting the variance is large enough that looking at the numbers would not conclusively show it either.
@_date: 2011-05-19 00:58:40
How is delivery done?
@_date: 2011-03-29 03:00:12
If I understand it all correctly, this still allows one to monitor all incoming coins to the published id. If this id is for payments or donations, that means that everyone can see how much money you are pulling in.
I believe this could all be avoided by doing the payments to an ip rather than a bitcoin address. It's a bit less convenient for the receiver, but should work perfectly well.
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:22:28
Solo mining still has a higher expected payout. It is hardly "stupid".
@_date: 2011-05-20 19:50:43
It doesn't use much more cpu than your typical flash ad. 100% of one core, on my system.
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:42:07
Doing it from a website also mean that the webmasters or anyone listening in on the connection can grab a copy of the card, a nice first step in brute forcing your password.
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:07:54
Do the CAs hold the private keys? That seems like an unnecessary vulnerability.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:52:29


Yes and yes. The option to handle security yourself does not mean you have to, and no "secure client" helps a damn bit if the user's computer is compromised (eg they installed a trojan). Ultimately a user will still need to keep authentication material secure, but something like a [Yubikey]( makes this quite simple.
In the meantime, anyone who doesn't know how to decently handle security themself needs to gtfo. It should hardly be surprising that being an early adapter in a computerized currency requires being able to use a computer. I am not even saying everyone needs to be encrypting their wallet file-- as long as your computer is physical secure this isn't much of an issue--but if you can't prevent your computer from being compromised using trivial methods then using Bitcoins is laughably stupid.
@_date: 2011-03-29 19:59:49
Not exactly an easy thing to do, and completely impossible to do in a forum or other website you don't fully control.

He is mostly correct. They become infinitely difficult to mine, so it will, most likely, take infinitely long to finish mining them.

In that case there is no particular reason to use BTC.

++ to the transaction fee comment. It probably doesn't make a big difference right now, but in the long run this is supposed to be used to make transactions faster.
Though the op probably just doesn't have the entire block chain or something.
@_date: 2011-06-04 03:52:54
This causes confusion with [actual bits]( It's not likely to cause confusion in context due to the different sizes, but... meh.
@_date: 2011-06-26 04:52:20
You cannot simply secure your wallet and expect everything to be safe. The computer itself needs to be secure. Otherwise your decryption keys will simply be logged and used by the attacker.
If you are at all paranoid, I recommend installing Debian stable on an old computer. Use FDE or home folder encryption. Then *keep it physically secure*. Nothing will protect you against hardware keyloggers.
@_date: 2011-05-17 03:02:58

@_date: 2011-06-18 00:54:08

Yeah. With mybitcoin down, I need a new sketchy website to put my $10k in btc.
@_date: 2011-05-18 22:21:07
I don't know what this was in response to (poster deleted the post), but, out of context, this sounds like a rather bad idea. Email is not appropriate for large amounts of money. Even if the email is encrypted for its entire journey (and it's usually not), this involves trusting the security, honesty, and reliability of both email providers. Encrypting the wallet before emailing it would help, but still leaves reliability issues. 
tl;dr: Email providers do not expect to be transporting money and therefore do not have appropriate measures in place. Emailing btc is like mailing money-- it will probably work out, but it is a bad idea for large amounts.
@_date: 2011-07-24 03:12:56
You might as well at least use FDE. Makes tampering much more difficult and eliminates the need for multiple partitions.
@_date: 2011-05-19 05:45:30
... Yeah, my comment there was rather stupid. Doubly so given that you would be spending the coins quite quickly, so an attacker would have only a few days to brute force the key.
@_date: 2011-05-19 00:12:50
As I said in my post, this leaves reliability problems (ie. the email could be lost).
Also, I wouldn't really want thousands of dollars encrypted simply with a short memorized key. A stored key could work, but this may be illegal to possess.
@_date: 2011-03-24 22:34:56
Given how easy it is to configure a server to mine Bitcoins, I don't see how a situation could possibly emerge in which the products of the mining are much larger than the costs of the servers. Such a situation would immediately result in server usage shifting towards more Bitcoin generation, which sparks an increase in difficulty and thus decreases the profit margins.
Bitcoin mining is not a means of creating wealth so much as transferring it from other forms.
@_date: 2011-08-13 05:12:33
Only 1% fees? Seems excessively small. Are you hoping to make money off of people forgetting to withdraw funds? If not, why not automatically transfer the funds periodically and/or when a certain amount accumulates?

I like the idea of putting the "prefix" last. It leaves no confusion with [actual bits]( and sounds quite nice.
The units can then be abbreviated to bc, bm, etc. This allows for the normal SI two-letter abbreviations without causing confusion with both bits and bytes.

The malware could easily grab the password as well. Encryption doesn't help if you can't trust your own machine.
@_date: 2011-05-19 01:21:49
Or just put the energy into encrypting it better?
This doesn't even touch the reliably problem, which was the *only* issue I mentioned with encrypting in my original post.
@_date: 2011-06-18 00:30:27


Wait, what? Does that comment have any relevance.
You are correct that your security is quite adequate. I just don't know why people use all these apps like 7zip and TrueCrypt for encryption when they are newer, weaker, and less standard than PGP. All else being equal, you might as well use the good stuff.
@_date: 2011-06-09 17:00:03
Mainly because of the lack of fees. Many pooled systems also introduce additional latency which, at least in theory, decreases the amount earned. And then you have to trust that the ops are not taking any extra money for themselves.

@_date: 2011-06-17 22:38:56
Great, we need services like this. But taking full responsibility for fraudulent transactions seems problematic. In case of a complete failure, you would need to be able to pay back 100% of the money in all the users accounts. The only way this could work is by getting an insurance policy to cover any large failures. Without this users will, justifiably, not trust you.
In order to make this policy even vaguely affordable, you will need to minimize the risks. Keeping your own servers secure shouldn't be too difficult, but users will most likely be reckless with their authentication data. I think most banks handle this by making the user responsible for the first $50 or so of charges. This could help you, though you may need to make that number larger due to the larger risk. Providing the option of strong authentication (eg Yubikeys and/or PGP) would also help (and would make me, as a customer, feel much better about the whole thing).
@_date: 2011-07-31 01:09:55
So the idea here is to use MtGox, which has recently had major security issues, as a debit account for Bitcoins? And, unlike the Instawallet solution revealed today, it does not easily allow for competitors to offer the same service without having to rework applications utilizing it?

@_date: 2011-06-15 01:22:44
If you have a really large amount of money in BTC and aren't completely confident in what you are doing, I think having a separate computer exclusively for bitcoins would be an excellent idea. Just pop Debian stable on there and only boot it up for security updates and transactions. Any risk of remote attack should be negligible.
@_date: 2011-06-09 15:21:36
Not before they make massive amounts of money off of it.
@_date: 2011-06-06 07:03:27
Bitcoin uses the same cryptography schemes as are used all over the place in computers. ssl, pgp, ssh, etc. Just about every computer security system would be made drastically less efficient and many would be completely compromised. It would be a serious issue and Bitcoin would be just a tiny part of it.
That said, a client patch could probably fix all of this by moving to a cryptography scheme not compromised by whatever advance was made. And I'd imagine that these developments wouldn't be made overnight or secretively, so there would be plenty of time to get everything patched up.
Technical discussion of this issue (or at least one aspect of it) can be found on the Wikipedia entry for [P=NP](

The "keep if off the network" strategy sounds like something from a bad SciFi movie. But it should work.
But this doesn't have to be nearly so painful. As long as we keep the computer secure we can actually use it rather than locking it up. I suggest:
* **Pick a machine to dedicate to bitcoin.** I will refer to this as "bitbank". It doesn't need much in terms of hardware specs, just needs to run. The paranoid may wish to check for hardware keyloggers and such, but it shouldn't really matter, as you will be keeping it physically secure.
* **Whip the HD and install a secure OS.** Should be something secure and reliable. Debian would be a good choice. Use full disk encryption. This will serve more as a barrier against tampering with the software (eg installing software keyloggers) than protecting the data.
* **Do not install any additional software on the computer, or even brows the web on it.** Yes, it should be okay as long as you use reputable software, etc. But we are being paranoid here. There could be security flaws anywhere. Only use it for bitcoin
* **Disable any "dangerous" software running on the machine.** This is pretty much just ssh or other remote login software. I'm pretty sure this isn't an issue in Debian, but I haven't done a desktop install for a while.
* **Install bitcoin.** Use official repos when possible, since this should be a signed package.
* ** Use your new bitbank.** Just send coins to it's address when you want, start it up only when you want to remove coins. Monitor the distro's site for any crucial security updates and do them, but other than that you are good.
* **Keep it physically secure.** No software protects you against an attacker planting a hardware keylogger in your machine. A safe or bank vault would be a good idea.
IMO this is much more usable, and I see no substantial security concerns.

It seems to me that, real or not, this is a problem which it would be beneficial to alleviate for the sake of increasing confidence in BTC.
Perhaps central servers, backed by trusted organizations and/or governments, could provide some more trustworthy confirmations, and possibly create blacklists of rogue nodes?
@_date: 2011-06-04 04:13:53
Bits are still commonly used to expression data transmission totals and rates.
It's also worth thinking about how this is going to be abbreviated. Millibits would likely go to mb, creating a conflict with the very common unit of megabytes. Technically this conflict shouldn't exist, as megabytes abbreviates to Mb, not mb. But it's rarely actually written that way.
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:21:09
That is like leaving your cash sitting on a ground floor window sill and then blaming the design of cash when it gets stolen. This issue has nothing to do with the protocol and everything to do with insufficient security precautions of the user. Anyone who isn't confident in their ability to secure their computer should clearly be hiring someone else to handle their bitcoins.

If half a million dollars are on the line they damn well should be able to.

I do hope you manage this. I'd love to be able to instantly and painlessly purchase btc.

If your computer is compromised all your passwords can be keylogged.
Just secure the damn computer. Run a good Linux distro, don't enable any potentially exploitable software (ssh, etc) without good reason and good security (pubkey authentication, etc) and none of this will be an issue.

Not really. You have the same expected value of money earned, just much greater deviation. Since no one is living off of btc mining or anything, this really shouldn't be a big difference.

There may be in the future. In the meantime, there is your own machine. Assuming you are running appropriate software, of course.

It wouldn't be a valid currency if you just make it from nothing. That's like saying you don't see the point in the USD because normal people can't print as much of it as the see fit. The supply has to be limited for it to be of any use.
