And don't forget [Bitcoinblaster]( which has a modest (but growing!) selection of consumer electronics and computer parts, and no minimum order.

That item is out of stock so was removed. Except for that image on the home page...

heard their competitor is better...

right on!

Agreed. All it would take is Amazon to one day start accepting bitcoins. If they threw in a 3% discount on bitcoin transactions (after all, there's no charge back losses and no transaction fees - it actually is cheaper to accept than a credit card) then that would be it. Mission accomplished. Of course that would also be the end of my little business... So don't you dare Amazon start accepting my imaginary internet nerd tokens!

We've had a rough week between hurricane Sandy and a DDoS attack (not directed at us, but the price you pay sometimes for shared hosting...)
But we're all geared up now and ready to go for Bitcoin Friday. We'll also be adding some additional inventory before then, so check back Friday to see some new stuff.

I could cut my prices considerably if my suppliers accepted bitcoins. Not to mention the time delay of currency exchange and ACH transactions, just to get those bitcoins to USD in an account where I can use them (if Mt. Gox offered a debit card like PayPal does, this would help too).
The possibilities are there for the "cheapest way to transact" use-case. But the market is still too immature.

I'll work on the HTTPS issue.
We have no physical presence, but I will update the details with actual contact information. Thanks!

If it were treated like cash that would mean Currency Transaction Reports filed on all btc transactions greater than $10k. Suspicious Activity Reports filed on any anomalous transactions. KYC requirements followed (this part at least is done already). There is in fact quite a large amount of regulation around cash.
It's not that I want it to be this way. But it must if it is to become a legitimate and viable long term currency beyond SR and ponzi schemes.

We don't use escrow. This is a legitimate e-commerce site. We have as verified business account with Mt Gox to handle btc. Products can be returned  for refund or exchanged. Legal process can be served. Same as any other e-commerce site.

A counterpoint I should make - the wrong influential party using bitcoins could be the absolute death of them. What if Iran begins semi-officially using bitcoins due to there own currency woes (which are multiplying quickly)? Bitcoin would be legislated away into irrelevance (I don't say destroyed, but being made illegal for citizens in every FATF compliant country to use is close enough).
Or, the other possible nightmare scenario, a major terrorist attack occurs somewhere and bitcoins are discovered to have been used in the financing. Then we can say hello to PATRIOT III and goodbye to btc.
This is all partially why I don't hold with the bitcoin ideologues. I'm a former AML professional. Those laws serve a purpose. This experiment can only succeed if we integrate within the legal global monetary system.

Bitinstant allows you to more or less do that. You set up an order on their site and do the transaction at CVS or Walgreens (or a bank branch).
Still, I agree with you. It's not easy enough to buy BTC and all these solutions seem sort of hack-ish.
I suspect the problem will be solved when some innovative company comes up with the right combination of ease of use and security (to handle credit cards, for instance).

Under the BSA, banks, casinos, money service businesses, insurance cos, and a few others. The reporting requirements do not apply to individuals. And the reporting is made to FinCEN, not the IRS.

No scam. We contract with an inventory management company to handle all the inventory and everything listed is very much available for purchase right now. If the site is buggy that's a function of it's newness and we're ironing out the problems as we go.

Not to go all sour grapes or anything, but (as a competitor) I find it a bit unsporting to operate on 0% markup...
