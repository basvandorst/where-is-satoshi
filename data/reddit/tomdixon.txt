And that's in a nutshell why crypto money can't go mainstream. There's a legit need for it for some people, but there are 10,000 ways you can slip up and lose all your money.

Actually it all started from 0 so it increased by infinity. At $1 it's still infinite increase. What other stock, bond, mutual fund, CD or precious metals could you have gotten with $0 that went up infinitely?
No matter how much you lose, you can simply take comfort that you invested in something with infinite gains. Even if you lost your retirement fund, you didn't actually lose it, it didn't even exist in the first place.

It will also help you when the crypto bubble pops. It's a good characteristic to have.

You're correct in everything in you said, I'd just add that as complicated as this looks, things are even more complicated by the fact that many cryptos have unique features and architectures. Fully understating one crypto alone takes weeks of research for tech savvy people, understanding 10 is out of reach for pretty much everyone except people who do it as a full time job.
After 8 years with many hundreds of millions of dollars poured into it it's still error prone to use, a minor slip up can cause the loss of the private key and the funds.

BTC was at $1000 when the theters were starting to get printed, not $8000.

It won't ever happen. It's a fragile system, you need electricity, computers and Internet to use it.

Well bad news then. In the past 6 months Dell, Valve and Reddit stopped taking BTC. The buying power has gone down.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:36:59
And that's the sane approach to be honest, a LOT of people lost money to scammers in the crypto world, including very experienced people. Why would inexperienced people take a risk with crypto when there's already a well working system in place?

Don't skip school, they teach good stuff there. You should invest some time into it.

There are literally over 1500 officially recognized coins. All secure, all with  different degrees of centralization/decentralization.


You buy Monopoly money with USD? No. But with forked chains, people will need to choose the chain they spend their money into, and less money goes into the original chain. It diluted the value of the original chain.

It was supposed to be decentralized too, lol. Even the centralized version is so brittle that it's near unusable.
Good luck competing with VISA, haha.

How is crypto money scarce? There are over a thousand of them, and everybody and their grandma can issue another one. And bitcoin be can forked any number of times, multiplying the existing coins and diluting their value. Other than that, totally scarce.

You pulled some assumptions out of thin air, so I didn't see any point to argue, but I have a hard time resisting my grammar nazi urges.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:19:57
Thank you.

Or even elementary school. As long as you know how to count your money, you have all you need to live the life of a crypto millionaire.

I'm a fiat billionaire then. Thanks!

That's my guess too. He doesn't have the wallet, he knows part of someone's mnemonic phrase, and wants a tool to bruteforce the missing words.
He barely speaks English, and can't even articulate clearly what his issue is. He wants to pay $25,000, but unfortunately his million dollars were in a single hot wallet on an exchange and he has no funds otherwise. Are you kidding me?
This has scam written all over it, along with the broken English.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:44:55
Yes, there should be a flat line from 2009 to 2018.

They buy an airplane or a helicopter instead, and use the light from the plane. None of my friends buy light bulbs any more.

They were thinking is looks better for bitcoin if they draw a shorter and more vertical line. A 9 year long flat line won't get upvoted.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:37:10
WTF is a 'mnemonic extension'? Are you talking about a mnemonic phrase? If you're talking about a phrase, which you have on a piece of paper, how did you forget it?
Don't you even realize that half the people don't even understand what your problem is?

Bitcoin's is sub 1% adoption in 9 years. Does that count as a failure or should we wait another 10 years before we can conclude that?
