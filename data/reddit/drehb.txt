Seed words are like your master key (can be for multiple types of coins too), and from it are derived a series of private keys. Addresses are derived from private keys.  Coins are sent to addresses, and you need the corresponding private key, in this case held in the hardware wallet, to move the coins from one address to another.

The problem with paper wallets is that they are difficult/inconvenient to use properly.  Maybe people use offline computers to generate the wallets, but most people will import the private keys into an online computer when it is time to spend them.  If that computer is compromised, you're at risk of losing those coins.  To achieve security equivalent to a hardware wallet, the key should be imported on an offline computer, and the desired transaction signed by that offline computer.  This is a big P.I.T.A.  Hardware wallets implement the whole secure paper wallet process in a convenient way.  Offline key generation. Offline storage. Offline transaction signing.  And add in the extra benefits of HD wallet capability, multi coin support, and FIDO 2FA.

I think the change goes back to the paper wallet address. Not 100% sure though.  One thing to note in this case is that the imported wallet is not part of the HD wallet (ie your Mycelium seed words won't cover this imported address)

x confirmations means how deep into the blockchain the transaction is.  The deeper it is, the less likely the transaction will be involved in a reorg.  Each transaction starts out as 0 confirmations, meaning it hasn't been included in a block yet.  After 6 confirmations (5 blocks built on top on the block that included the transaction), it is generally considered finalised.

They are generated as a reward for the people who keep track of how many Bitcoins each address holds.  This reward happens approximately every 10 minutes, and the amount of the reward drops in half every 4 years.  Anyone is able to participate in this process (mining), although these days it is a very competitive industry and hard to do profitably for the average Joe.

The nonce can be anything, not necessarily the number of attempts made.  Think of a mining pool where many miners are working on the same block in parallel.  Then it obviously wouldn't make sense for it to be sequential like that.  It is more like a random number.

How come no one mentions disallowing empty blocks?  I can see empty blocks being useful back when the network had very few transactions, but they seem counter productive these days.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:30:11
Miners can put whatever transactions into a block that they wish.  All nodes on the network validate that the block 'plays by the rules'
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:07:50
Not exactly cheating, just not in the best interest of the network.  For one thing, it encourages empty blocks, which reduces the capacity of the network. More importantly, they are incentivized to block upgrades to the protocol that are not compatible with this boosting technique.
It is alleged that they have however cheated the customers who they sold mining equipment to by making their own units secretly more efficient than those that they sold.
@_date: 2019-04-06 03:10:14
The ELI5 - Bitcoin has more mining power behind it than their own blockchain, so it is more secure. By embedding some of their blockchain data in the Bitcoin blockchain, it isn't as easy for nefarious actors to mess with their chain.  The Bitcoin blockchain is used like a second point of reference (like checkpointing)

Verifying transactions is not computationally difficult. The crazy processing power that miners employ is used to find the block hashes that meet the required difficulty. That is where the computation and power is spent. It is also what ensures the security of the network.

Sure, it is about freedom to use your money whenever and however you want, but it is also related to immutability.

Agreed, trollish.  The exchange was pretty transparent about what happened in their post.  They upgraded geth, and in the version they upgraded to this contract they were calling to do the splitting was no longer called correctly.  As it turns out, the contract was not written to reject this incorrect call, hence the ETH being stuck.  So lots of little issues adding up to a bigger one.  Poorly written contract. Poorly tested deployment.  Breaking change in geth.
