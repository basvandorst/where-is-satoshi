Yes, you're quoting someone who marks on someone else's property.

Instead of wasting time replying to you, you can be summed up by one comment:


Apple doesn't ship any OLED displays.
Just stop.

I'm perfectly fine paying programmers money for their work, and they have a right to protect their work.

Hooooly shit. How old are you?
You are aware that basically all Google employees have macs, right?

LOL! Winamp wasn't the first mp3 player. He's talking about the iTunes store. Maybe you don't remember because you're young, but you couldn't legally purchase individual songs for 99 cents. Steve Jobs convinced the record companies to sell all of their songs unbundled for a flat rate.


Ok, now you're just being ignorant. The market share for macs was minuscule when the iPod was announced. It wasn't until they added USB and Windows support that it exploded.


Glorified feature phones. A stepping stone to true smartphones.


For very generous definitions of tablet. They had fans, didn't run a tablet OS, didn't have tablet apps, weren't capacitive, horrible battery life, heavy, why am I still talking... you were probably one of the people who thought the iPad was going to flop.


This is an opinion held by people who think they understand tech, but don't know enough to know that they're wrong. Recent innovations:
A7, touchID, Mac Pro, retina MacBook Pro, wait... there's no convincing such a staunch fanboy. Nevermind.

“There was a time when Macs were a small part of the Google fleet,” Google system engineer Clay Caviness said, “but as of now if you start at Google and want to use a platform other than Mac you have to make a business case.”

I don't think that's the case at all. A closed operating system doesn't threaten bitcoin.

    This is what libertarians actually believe.

Not using isn't the same as not being interested in it. Open source isn't the best tool for every job.

Why? If you're a company you want:
 * Well-built machines that aren't expensive to maintain.
 * An OS that lets you get stuff done. (Terminal)
 * A secure OS.
 * Happy employees.

Imagine the shitshow if PayPal did this to a bitcoin ad.
Pony up and buy an add if you want to do this.
