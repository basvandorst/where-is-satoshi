If you had a spend only ln channel I guess that could work.

You pretty much can't. There are P2P guys on licalbitcoins or paxful, but you'd be crazy to pay their fees. Better to find some other way.
@_date: 2019-03-15 07:26:39
If you trade bitcoin p2p for long enough your bank account will very likely get closed. The Pro bitcoin sellers have all burned through several accounts.

If that's how it will be just switch to dogecoin.. BTC can live or die with 21m supply

Yea or they could go fractional and leverage up those assets!

No. Guaranteed they will be hacked eventually.

Probably. It worked with openssl.

The number two option is more similar to number 1 - basically the spv wallets still download all the blocks and scan them but the blocks are stripped to just the header and transactions that match the bloom filter so it's still kind of slow... On the other hand I think electrum maybe does do queries like you suggested to the electrum server component. But normal full nodes don't have the ability to search for stuff other than by block id. 
3) I'm not sure - but you're probably right
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:40:27
Simple - it will contain lots of memory.
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:11:14
It lists fiat markets too.. it would be better if it showed the seller/buyers rating and what payment method the transaction was..
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:26:34
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:06:19
Not really. Far better to spend it on bills and use some other $50 from your bank acct to buy BTC. The only other way is probably some P2P trade where the guy takes a 20-30% cut.. no point imo.
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:23:01
Not really. Pay your electric bill with it and buy BTC using the normal electric bill money from your bank 
@_date: 2019-02-17 17:03:23
Basically the wallet knows what keys it has and scans the blocks and unconfirmed transactions from the mempool as they come in. Initially it does have to scan the blockchain. That's what the bitcoin core wallet does anyway. Spv wallets use a bloom filter to tell the full node they're connected too approximately what addresses they're interested in without telling them the exact addresses. It could also be that some wallets just call a centralised explorer type service that tracks every transaction by address for fast querying. And just look up the exact addresses they want. That's the worst way for privacy since it allows the service to know what keys are part of the same wallet.

The problem is that you start a payment to someone they can sit on it for a few days and either accept it or fail it then. How much can the price of the alt change in a couple of days? A lot. So whoever is providing the exchange has a lot of volatility risk. They will need to charge a large transaction fee to protect themselves. The large tx fee makes the whole process generally unattractive and so it probably won't be used that much.
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:19:04
When you put it like that... It's still nothing

All that has to happen for more insane fomo is the price has to go up for a while.

I'm pretty sure bitcoin based finance can be made complicated enough for pro bankers to get involved.

Perhaps.. there could also be problems with one side cashing out a previous and more advantageous channel state before their counterpart notices.

A fake trezor could pretend to install real firmware.. or actually install it but still retain control from outside where the firmware is running. Is this likely? I have not heard of it yet.. but that doesn't mean it hasn't or won't.

That's pretty interesting.. also when playing with the guess if they're real game sometimes you'll get one that doesn't have any teeth.

Basically there is no such thing as custom hardware resistant. GPU minable coins are just coins that aren't worth the effort of developing custom mining hardware (due to lack of adoption).

I guess so. Good luck getting them out though (no support or tools).

They use a lot of bank transfers in Germany. Interac e-Transfer in Canada.. I guess other countries may have their own national payment systems.. maybe mobile payments like Venmo or swish (Sweden)
