I think that's only in a vacuum, but I'm no science knower.

what's the question? are you trying to convert to ATX?

No problem on my end, you're the one who needs help, eh? I saw on bitcointalk many months ago that someone was fabricating interface boards to convert the server psu to ATX. That'd work, surely, but you'll probably pay way more for the board than the psu.
If you've got a soldering iron and some ATX cables and you're comfortable reading a pinout, you can pretty easily convert it DIY style. 
[Here's what mine looks like.](
The larger AWG wire (12 maybe?) are the + and - and the thing wires are just wires to short out the fan pins. Without being plugged in to a server there is nothing to regulate the fan speed, so unless you short the pins it's going 100% all the time. This PSU is a 750 and it's only really pulling closer to 350ish watts, so even with the fan on low (ie shorting the pins) the PSU doesn't really get warm. Incidentally, this PSU is the Dell 2950, so it should be very similar to yours. Only a 50 watt difference and I can't imagine the pinout would be different.
If you go the DIY route, there are plenty of places that talk about how to do it.

Didn't take long. Didn't have to download the whole blockchain again or anything, just verify the blocks that were already on the computer. 10 minutes maybe? Don't remember. Pretty slow computer but it worked fine and I was pruned and ready in no time.

I just enabled pruning on an instance of Bitcoin QT on a Mac. 
bitcoin.conf didn't exist so I created a blank text file called bitcoin.conf and put it in ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
in the .conf file there is one line and all it says is 
    prune=1000
I exited and re-opened Bitcoin QT. It re-verified the blocks and initiated pruning. My /blocks folder when from 99GB to 985MBs.
