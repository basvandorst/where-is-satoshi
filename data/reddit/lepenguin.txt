I assume you mean't didn't, I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:23:49
Already on it, and attempting to learn how to use it better. It seems like some pretty nice software.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:28:39
OK, but even if the computer is offline, the wallet can still always be accessed if someone is able to import the data into a client and hash away at the password, so options like 2FA and timed releases would stop that from happening because even if they crack the password, as long as you check the wallet from time to time it is easy to stop a transaction from going through with timed releases.

Nope. hadn't sent anything since 7/6/14

Regular Bitcoin client.

There are only two people who have access to my computer, my fiance and me. She has no clue how to use Bitcoin. I don't torrent on this computer and I have updated and secured AV/AS. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:09:17
I don't know what that means so I am going to say no
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:31:13
My balance is .6 and it says -4.6 in transaction details
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:46:14
nobody has access to my .dat file and its been encrpyted for over 3 years now.
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:00:38
I don't know about change address, and I have had this wallet since 2011
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:52:52
.03 btc

OK, so if my system is insecure and most computers are insecure, what is a proper method of taking care of this? wouldn't you agree better wallets that are more secure and offer easier methods to secure them such as 2FA and timed releases?
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:45:31
Yes, and no. I do not back up my computer I did have a backup of my wallet.dat on a flash drive that has not been used since its creation.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:27:07
How would I find out?
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:05:56
windows 7, using bitcoin wallet, no idea at this point does not look like infection or trojans. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:22:02
I feel as though although we have taken great steps, but we still have a long way to come in securing Bitcoin wallets, such as 2FA and having waiting periods for hot and cold wallets. I really like the vault from Coinbase I just wish there was something on a consumer level to do the same thing.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:45:22
I guess I don't understand I have 2FA enabled through my phone, why would it matter for my email?
@_date: 2014-07-28 04:22:36
Oh same here I work in in IT I know infections since I deal with them on day to day operations. I can't find anything going on with my computer and all processes check out
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:32:07
Ive purchased a steam game but other than that nothing, and I enabled 2FA and location locks on my gmail to keep my 2FA secured.
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:24:32
So in other words make sure you have your email accessible only at certain locations
@_date: 2014-03-05 01:31:46
But as we can see 2FA can be bypassed some how so why not just say I can only access email from these IP addresses
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:35:45
But I haven't spent any of them. I just opened the account  had money going in every week or two. Then forgot about them. Also what kind of answer is that. They aren't going to help me?

@_date: 2012-12-31 03:31:58
OK how would you like to do this
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:30:23
Is there a list of tools I can get to see items like lag time on exchange servers, and a list of all exchanges servers, difficulty of mining and current block.
