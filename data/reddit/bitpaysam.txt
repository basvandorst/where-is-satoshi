Hey I'm Sam and I work at BitPay as one of the plugin/integration developers.
As stated, BitPay doesn't require that information, but we make it optional for merchants to include.
[Here's our old API documentation](  You'll notice on page 7 that the only required information is the price and input currency code.  Page 8 and 9 lists the optional buyer fields.  All merchants that integrate our service via our API can opt out of including that information.
That being said, our plugins/integrations might be sending that information by default and not giving the merchants an option to opt out of it in the plugin's admin section.  I'll talk with my team about adding that as a setting in all plugins.  If you ever have any suggestions about how we can improve our service and especially our plugins/integrations, please feel free to PM me directly.  Thanks!

Awesome! I'm glad that our service has been working well for you and I hope that BitPay can be used for your hotspot payment processing!

Hey BitPay doesn't have any official plugins for wifi hotspots to my knowledge.
I know that [Chillifire]( is a hotspot managment system that is setup with multiple payment methods:


I don't know if they relegate their methods only to credit cards, or if they are open to linking to a bitcoin processor like BitPay.  If their service interests you, maybe you can request them to use one!

Sam from BitPay here, and keen on suggestions we are!  If you have any ideas on how we can make the checkout process "braindead simpler", feel free to shoot me a PM about it!  We are constantly trying to get it *right*, but it is a process.
