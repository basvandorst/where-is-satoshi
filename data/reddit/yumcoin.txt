Interesting! [BitPremier]( also has a few used cars for sale (ie. a 2012 BMW M3 selling for about 628 BTC).

Congratulations on launching -- it's always great to see new Bitcoin services coming up. We're looking forward to testing Inputs.io out.

Congrats, Spencer! You can buy *Stick's Masterpiece* with bitcoins, on Yumcoin.

In the beginning, it would be good to clearly explain and differentiate between Bitcoin (capitalized) for the system, the software, and the network, and bitcoin (lowercase) for units of the currency.
It's great to see an explanation of Bitcoin that isn't overly complex or metaphorical. Hopefully, you continue to improve this document!
