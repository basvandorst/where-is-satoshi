I will skip the rest of your obvious misunderstandings, but this one is too huge to ignore.  "Store of value", is a standard term, means pretty much what it says and your "re-definition" is bizarre.   Sample this:
*A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.*
See if you can relate bitcoins wild volatility to "predictably useful when retrieved".    Perhaps a "contra-example" will help you.   Right now, I have $10 in my pocket; in a week I will go to KFC and there use my $10 to get same type of meal that I got today; both KFC and I can rely on $10 having pretty much the same value next week that it does now.   Same thing with all other transactions, e.g. rent, utilities, etc.  Why is my monthly rent a fixed number dollars for the next 18 months?  Because my landlords can generally rely on what he will be able to do with a fixed number of dollars over the next 18 months.  Store of value.
On the other hand, nobody can count on what one can do with bitcoin on a weekly basis.  Not even on a daily basis.   And fixed supply, immutability and cryptographic keys are of absolutely no help in that regard.

Accepting bitcoin for payment is a real hassle for business and one with zero advantages; a few places try it as a curiosity that they hope will bring in some new business, but they quickly give up in despair.      That is why bitcoin will never really function as a currency or money.

I live in Africa, and I can assure you that these are mostly fantasies by people looking for use cases (beyond speculation) of bitcoin.   Such people know nothing of Africa and can't be bothered to learn.
The first reality is that almost all African currencies are no less stable that currencies elsewhere, and all African currencies are certainly more stable that bitcoin.  You will sometimes read stories of the Zimbawean dollar; what most people don't know is that such a thing has not existed as a currency for almost 10 years: 
The second reality is that large-scale use of bitcoin in Africa is next to impossible, for a very simple reason: people cannot get their hands on it.   Most people do not have the disposable income to buy bitcoins, and mining it is even less of a practicality than in other places.   
Third, there are very very very few places in Africa that will take bitcoin for anything.    Zero for practical purposes.
Sure, there are people in Africa who are interested in bitcoin.   But it is mostly the same as elsewhere, i.e. as a speculative investment.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:57:31
Easier and safer to deliver for what purpose?    The problem with BTC is that its value is based on nothing.   And you misunderstand the so-called market cap.  Let me see if I can explain it succinctly.
BTC reached its highest "market-cap" so far back in Dec 2017.   That was almost-entirely driven by the mad FOMO greed in the last quarter of 2017.  (Given the painful lessons that have since been learned, such FOMO is never coming back.)
The current "market-cap" has nothing to do with any real value of BTC.   The only reason the "market-cap" has not yet fallen to zero is that there are still enough people (some of whom have already lost their shirts) who still foolishly  believe that the past will be repeated.   
With the prospects of little real use in sight, the only path for BTC is down.
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:41:56
And we will be able to keep all of it and do as we please with it, because governments and banks can't control or stop bitcoin.   Right?
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:12:19

@_date: 2018-04-08 00:32:49
Nice piece of work as an intro!   To improve it, I'd suggest filling "holes" created by assumptions.   For example, you assume the reader has some knowledge of abstract algebra (finite fields etc.), some number theory (modular, aka residue, arithmetic), and so forth.   It would not require much space to explain "enough" of those things, and it would increase the value of your work to the general redditor here ... I think.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:09:27
I don't see how your rudeness and foul language contributes anything useful.   Please mend your ways.   
I have presented numerous helpful facts on this forum.   A good start for you would be in the public-service announcement on this very "Daily Discussion" thread.
I do know a great deal about the technology.   I also know a great deal of the general context around bitcoin.   It is on the basis of my deep knowledge and broad expertise that I am in a position to give the advice I have given.
Yes, one may argue that in theory there are "literally a billion different scenarios can play out by the end of this year".   One can and may make such an argument on just about anything.   Nevertheless, the practical reality will always more constraining, and the practical reality for bitcoin is that it is slowly sinking.   Expect $3K at the end of the year. In know that's tough to swallow, given the dreams of many, but with my timely warning at least those who are wide-awake will be prepared.   Good luck!
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:10:18
And they will pay that some other provider with bitcoin, right?   LOL!

**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: UNDERSTANDING LIMITATIONS OF BITCOIN**
*Borrowed from*: 
The cleverness of the underlying technology doesn’t mean that bitcoin is viable as a form of money. And it certainly doesn’t mean that the legions of punters rushing to buy bitcoin as an investment for the future can be confident of earning superior returns, or indeed any returns at all.
Enthusiasts like bitcoins because their supply is limited. The pace at which bitcoin “miners” can create new units automatically declines over time, with the maximum possible number of bitcoins fixed at 21 million. To converts, that limit means that bitcoins, unlike the fiat currencies issued by the world’s central banks, can never be debased by governments intent on printing as much money as it takes to pay off their debts.
Yet despite their scarcity, bitcoins possess no intrinsic value. Unlike hard commodities – copper, say, or even gold – bitcoins have no utility value. And unlike securities such as bonds or stocks, bitcoins do not carry the promise of a future cash flow that allows investors to put a hard figure on their value today.
Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that much the same can be said for fiat currencies. With interest rates around the world close to zero or even negative, conventional currencies also offer no income streams, and hence carry no real value. They are nothing more than an illusion, a confidence trick perpetrated by cynical governments on their gullible populations.
But that argument misses a crucial point. Fiat currencies do have an inherent value. The US dollar, for example, has value because the US government insists that Americans must pay their taxes in US dollars. And if they fail to pay their taxes, the US government will send them to jail (unless, of course, they are rich enough to employ expensive accountants and lawyers to devise legal tax dodges). That threat creates an underlying demand for US dollars which lends the currency a real value.
Without similar backing from a government, bitcoin lacks any inherent value. Yet even if it were to win the status of legal tender, bitcoin would still have critical drawbacks. In particular, the very factor that enthusiasts like most about the cryptocurrency – its limited supply – ensures it will never replace conventional currencies as a widely-used form of money. That is because if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall. And if prices are falling, businesspeople become increasingly reluctant to borrow to invest, because they would have to sell ever more stuff to service their debt. But with falling prices, customers defer their purchases, which means selling stuff gets ever harder.
In short, the widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of exchange, unit of account and store of value would depress demand and discourage investment, leading to economic stagnation and a rising real burden of debt. It would be a disaster.
Bitcoin could still have a useful future as a specialist means of exchange for internet transactions. However, no one is currently using it for that purpose. Instead it has become a vehicle purely for momentum-based speculation. But with no intrinsic value to support prices, and with alternative cryptocurrencies springing up by the hundred and threatening to negate the very scarcity that is touted as bitcoin’s chief virtue, the bubble that last week propelled the price of bitcoins to a record high is clearly unsustainable.
**Read it again.  Carefully**

Nobody is in it just for the tech.  In fact, despite their claims, most don't *really* understand the tech beyond a few misguided regurgitations of clueless summaries.  They just say that because it makes them feel a little better even as the thing is going to the dogs.

You make some very significant points.   Unfortunately, the bitcoin community does not appreciate the fundamental reasons that get in the way of widespread adoption by the general public, something that is necessary if this is to be a real currency and not just a tool for speculative gambling and criminality.   Instead, the bitcoin community is obsessed with "neat" technical solutions that solve non-existent problems.   
SegWit, Lightning, this or that fancy wallet ... all of which mean nothing to regular folks who have few problems with debit cards, credit cards (which come with associated protections), bank transfers, etc.  Anonymity, decentralization, fighting governments, breaking down banks ... these mean nothing to most people in their everyday use of money.   
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:22:51
Take a look here at the daily wailing and gnashing of teeth as the thing continues to go to the dogs.   Does that give you a clue?   
The fact that it is up 6x or whatever does not give much comfort.   **Do you know why it is up that much?**  Because of the mad FOMO rush in late 2017.  **That's most bitcoin people.**  And it is those people who are feeling the pain.   You think telling them about 6x makes a difference.

**URGENT PUBLIC-SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: REGARDING 23 APRIL**
*From:* 
"Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.
Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.
"**Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense**," Stripe product manager Tom Karlo wrote in the announcement. 
When Stripe first enabled bitcoin payment process in 2014, advocates for the cryptocurrency believed that it could be a cheaper than credit cards like Visa, which charge seller-side customers a fee on top of each transaction, and more accessible to people in part of the world without banks or stable currencies. 
"Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive," Karlo wrote in the blog entry. 
*That hope, it turns out, was misplaced*."

The fact that they are "here to stay" does not necessarily mean that they will be a big part of the financial system, all it means is that they will exist.   Moreover, since you have no basis for determining the "fair market value" of any crypto, you also have no basis for stating that "BTC market cap is ridiculously low for the leading crypto". 
The future of crypto is actually very dim, and that is very evident in the continuing downward trend.  (Please don't say "it has gone down before and then gone up!".   There was very little awareness of such things back then.)

I too am no FUDster.  I just present the facts in a direct, succinct, and elegant manner.   True, the facts are probably rather "hard" for the "true believers", and I don't sugar-coat anything, but it is not as though I have created the reality of the situation. 
It is unfair and unhelpful that people have chosen to not see the public service in my "cautionary" notes and have instead resorted to unfriendly labels.

Excellent points.  Unfortunately many don't see that the mad Dec-2017 FOMO rush, greatly helped by the mass media, was an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.
I think for major change to happen, it will be necessary to deal with the concerns and issues of "average" people when it comes to getting paid, using money for daily goods and services, borrowing money, protections on purchases, etc.   Decentralization, anonymity, fighting governments, getting rid of banks ... are not things that concern most people.  
There needs to be a move from "geek" stuff to what people really care about.   Why obsess over Ligghtning Network and SegWit and what-not when, as it is, the overall system is such that hardly anyone will use it anyway?

You still haven't given a basis for such a statement.   A simple belief on your part is not enough.   What's more, to most wide-awake people, the current market caps are ridiculously high, given that it is solely based on speculative greed and not on the production and consumption of useful goods and services, as happens with whatever cash is circulating in Canada.

This crash is very different.  In the past there have always been enough suckers to bring in new money.  After the hysterical FOMO rush of last year, accompanied and implicitly encouraged by the mass media, way too many people now know a few things.   
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:40:07


Not quite.   It all depends on the parameters.   If they are small enough, then brute force will work just fine.    Generally, I think that you just need to "fine-tune" various statements all over the place.    
One thing that you definitely need is a clear explanation of the e.c discrete-log problem.   Once you have that, you can actually exclude most of the "mechanical details".    
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:10:59
The fact that hes said (and probably still believes) that it is a bubble is unrelated to his making money off it.   Nothing to do with a "philosophical stance". Think about this: who really makes the big money in a bubble?   A few smart people, or the final bag-holders?
I don't know what his plans are, but I'd be surprised if they were long term (in the sense of "hodling").    My guess that he will, if he indeed does go in, stay long enough to make his money and then get out before the bubble bursts.

Yes.  Note that these are things that "are not money".   So I take it we are in agreement that bitcoin is not money?   Second, none of the things in that category can be compared with bitcoin.   Take a look at the examples.   Which of this is similar to bitcoin in its wild volatility? 
Bitcoin belongs to what the rest of the article deals with:
"**Speculative instruments are not stores of value**. *They may "have value" when purchased, but are not "a reasonably stable store of future value". As mentioned above, the key to defining if an asset can be considered a store of value, is that it can predictably retain purchasing power into the future*.
*At various times throughout history, people and nations have famously made the mistake of believing that they could "store value" in speculative instruments, misunderstanding that* **ones personal choice to invest in a speculative asset does not automatically convert that asset into a proper and predictable store of value**."
Bitcoin is the "famous example" of our times, and it will all end rather badly, as have all other "examples".

They do not understand that it is just a point where the buying and selling is such that the trend is (perhaps temporarily) stopped.  Instead, they look at the past and assume that there is something magical about the number at which that was last observed or some number off some magical chart.  Does anyone really know what will happen at $5.5K or $4.6K.  Definitely not.

Further, people fail to see a very important trend: in all the down-and-ups, the tops of the ups keep getting lower. From 12K to  11K to 10K to 9K ...  in just the last couple of months.

Bitcoin is barely used to purchase goods and services anywhere.   To the extent that it is (very very slightly used), it is more like tokens in some specialty environment or gift cards or ...


Bitcoin as a global currency?  LOL!  You people are serious dreamers!


A much higher market cap for bitcoin, which is mostly used for only greedy speculation and criminal activities?   I don't think so.    **What's more, as it becomes less useful for those activities its market cap will inevitably drop to zero or near-zero.** When you look at it a year from now, remember I told you that.

I can't comment on what someone else said without full knowledge of the context of the quotations.    But, yes, it pretty much about groups---cyclic, finite subgroups.  In the particular case at hand, the subgroup is generated from a base point (designated G in the specification), but the essential  (i.e. algebraic aspects) are somewhat independent of the particular field.      
Think about this: You have taken a "standard" approach of first giving a geometric interpretation numbers (over real numbers) and then going to the "real" thing (over finite fields).   Why not just skip the first part?   Those nice graphs don't really help anyone in understanding what follows: as you note continuous curves vs. discrete points. The only benefit of the geometric interpretation is that when you actually get to the implementation of point addition, the relevant equations are essentially those of the geometric interpretation but modified for finite-field arithmetic.   But you are not really discussing the implementation of point addition, on which point multiplication depends.    
It is late night for me, and I don't have much time, but you can see some of this if you also correct some of statements.  E.g. 


Actually elliptic curves have a more general from.     In particular, in cryptography, curves of the form y^2+xy = x^3 + ax + b are also widely used, and with binary fields instead of prime fields (the mod-p stuff).  If you start to think of different equations and different fields, you will see how you could come up with neater explanations, because you will "abstract" away from the *details* of point addition and point multiplication and what not.  You just have some operations involving groups and fields.     
I think you would end up with cleaner presentation if you start by thinking in terms of the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem, which is what is at the core of this.    Precede that with some stuff on groups and finite fields.  Then your case of GF(p) is just one "case", and you can also skip all those geometric pictures.
You can also skip all the stuff about "speeding point addition".   They don't really help in understanding elliptic-curve cryptography,   Not only are they just implementation details, the way addition is implemented and speeded up will depend on the field used.   And even with your particular choices, there are other alternatives.   
I don't know if that helps.   Anyways, it's nice to see tutorials like yours, and I hope you will polish it into the fine piece of work it could be.    
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:57:43

You should have read beyond the headlines and the misguided excitement of the bitcoin zealots.  What was passed was only first-stage legislation.   Know how much legislation reaches that stage and then goes nowhere?   


People around the world certainly use it for speculation and criminal activities, but it is definitely not a form of currency.  Nor will it ever become "a world accepted form of currency".  


The only people who care about such things are criminals, social misfits and teenage geeks in parents' basement.   All others are not into fighting governments and banks and what-not; in fact they rely a great deal on such institutions.    Even those who are here daily yelling about how they will hodl because they are in it for the tech and what-not are really just after one thing: government-issued money (i.e. real money) in a government-regulated bank (real bank).   That's the  planned end-game for all.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:56:56
You really should think a bit before you rush to the keyboard.   By way of encouraging you, let me give you just a small example: in order to receive BTC payment in that wallet, a business must calculate a fiat price in BTC.   Why, because it is fiat that is the real money; that is how he pays his suppliers, for utilities, rent, etc.   Now, how often does, say BTC/USD price change?  The never-ending cries of anguish on the "Daily Discussion" thread should give you an idea.   Then you have the whole business of having to wait for confirmations and what-not.   Are you starting to get the idea?   Good.   
Thinking of using third parties to ease the pain?   Sample this:
**Stripe, the $9 billion online payments company, is putting an end to the product that enabled retailers to accept bitcoin as payment.**
**Citing a decrease in use by both retailers and customers, Stripe said will wind down support for its bitcoin payment application and stop processing bitcoin payments entirely on April 23.**
Now, go off and finish your homework.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:36:20
LN is solving a problem that doesn't exist.  Excluding gamblers, greedy speculators, and criminals, nobody has much use for bitcoin.   So, why does it matter if one can transfer $0.0001 BTC quickly.
The whole things is a bit of a joke anyway.   People and small businesses are going to go to all that trouble when cash and debit cards are already handy?  
It is a pity that the bitcoin community doesn't understand what's really holding back wide adoption (as in actual use) and instead devote time and energy to misguided technical solutions that then have to look for a problem.   
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:42:11

Sorry.  Contrary to what bitcoin zealots think, the world has since moved on from the few crazy days of 2017.  Nobody was ever fighting bitcoin, but it has certainly become more urgent for the proper authorities to clamp down on all these crypto scams.

The Nov/Dec rush, which pushed BTC to its ATH was a matter of people rushing in with hopes of getting rich quick. Many of those people got burned, learned a painful lesson, and won't be back.
BTC prices are on a downward trend, towards zero.  The current BTC prices are what they are  only because some people still imagine, that there will be a greedy rush (and they will get rich) or that BTC will at least recover to the point where they can get out without a loss.   None of that will happen.
The past---i.e. BTC going down and recovering---is not a helpful guide here, because people are now more aware than they were in the past.   There won't be any new money coming into bitcoin; the only people now making money are those involved in "pump and dump" schemes in which they fleece "hodlers" who mistakenly believe in "daily cost averaging".   
You should be very concerned.  My advice to you is that you get out now, even at a loss, instead of hodling a bag of nothing at the end.

Lesson learned.  Next time don't listen to the "be your own bank!" crap.    Take fiat, to a real bank.

OK, I get you now.   Yes, it will certainly mature into something less volatile when its value drops to near-zero, which is inevitable, and nobody has any use for it (not even speculation-driven greed and criminal activities.   That will be good for the general public, but I fail to see why it should be regarded as good by the bitcoin zealots.

**Is bitcoin a decentralized pyramid/ponzi scheme?**
This is *not* FUD.  I am genuinely interested.   From what I can see, some people got rich, but not because goods and services of value were being created somewhere (as would be the case with stocks in a real company).    People got rich because others hoping to get rich rushed in and pushed up the price.   So it has basically been money flowing from the many to the few.   And now there is little new money coming in, whence the daily panics here over prices.
What do people think of the situation?

Who will build these "uses", and why would they be bothered to?  LN just is just some more software for the existing bitcoin zealots to play around with.   **It will not make any difference to the rest of the world.**  Remember I said that when you look at it a year from now. 
Take look at the threads on this sub-reddit?   You seriously think they matter to regular people?   The problem with bitcoin zealots is that they are wrapped up in their little world that they cannot connect with the reality of the  world around them.   That is why bitcoin will ultimately fail.

How am I shitting on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:51:36
Are you kidding? Of course, it is.   Wall Street is "central station" for separating suckers from their money.   They have been at it for ages, and are now very good at it.   Don't get fooled by the mere fact that they have thrown a small amount of money bitcoin's way.   
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:16:10
Why would people in that group buy?   Because they believe in the tech? If so, then the price of btc should not matter.   Because they hope to make money from it?   From whom in that case?   Other members of the group?

With such words, you will never make friends or influence people.      Try and improve your attitude!
By the way, who were you "engaging with" when you responded to my comment?
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:04:22
**VERY IMPORTANT PSA**: Dear friends, please stop worrying about BTC price in terms of the useless fiat that we are going to replace quite soon.   Remember this is about freedom from governments and corrupt thieving banks, and about a technology that is going to change the world!    As a first adopter, your reward will come when BTC is the global currency.   You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams.   So stop panicking.
HODL AND WAIT FOR MOON SPACESHIP!

I wouldn't call it trolling.  I am on a mission to make sure that people understand the dangers of all this "cryptocurrency" stuff.   
Nothing "went wrong" with me, but I have seen the increasingly bad world that we are in with these scams and misguided get-rich-quick schemes.   
No, I don't get paid, but if you are so inclined, feel free to donate to the cause.   Thank you, Brother &amp; Friend.
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:06:46
Yep.  But the bitcoin zealots will never see that.   They keep talking about P2P even as exchanges are raking it in from the larger and larger numbers that rely on them.   
Oh, and what can these "new banks" really compete on the services currently offered by the "old banks"?

Pay attention, because you are about to learn something that the fleeced sheeple never understand.   
In any bubble, who really makes the money and who ends up holding the bag.   2008 was a big one.   Who went laughing to the bank, and who got a proper pole in the rear end?   Now, in this bitcoin bubble, which side is Soros on and which side are the dim redditors on?
Try to use your head.   Don't just start jerking off with "George Soros is in, so this is a great sure thing!".   Have you heard what the man really thinks of bitcoin, but which apparently won't stop him from making money off the fools?

Seriously?   What exactly does "protocol" mean to you?
Staying alive?   That's it?   You think that will ensure its ultimate success even without any real uses?   What exactly has been accomplished with that "protocol" in the 9 years?
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:39:48
Seen the "moon"-"lambo" types around lately?  Probably not.  People are beginning to realize that BTC is slowly but surely going to the dogs.   Plenty of bad attitudes all around.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:32:56
I am not blaming LN.  I am simply pointing out that those who focus on it as a means to wide-spread adoption don't understand what the real problems are.   
Yes, what's holding back wide-spread adoption of bitcoin is that really nobody has any use for it.   I'm glad we agree on that.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:04:58
The only problem is that BTC is finally, slowly heading to its real value, which is near-zero.  In such a case, neither hodling nor timing is very smart.  The best thing to do is to get out.

The writer limits his example to US dollars.  I see no reason to believe that it is necessarily to be extended to any and all currencies.   
Still, let us consider this.   Let us suppose that the US dollar has value for the reasons given by the author.  And according to you, that does not apply to the United Arab Emirates dirham because "no tax until ... revenue from oil ...".
Here is a question: what is the (mostly) standard currency for trading in oil?  **What currency have the sheiks been taking for their oil for all these years?  Why?**  The UAE dirham is not a free-floating currency; it is pegged to the dollar.   Why? What do you think would happen to the UAE currency if  USD tanked?


As indicated above, I did not write that.  But let me try and take a *guess* at what the author is alluding to: contrary to what bitcoin zealots think, "limited volume of money" is ultimately a disaster; and we know that from past "experiments".  Indeed, one of the most important jobs of a central bank is to periodically adjust the money supply---increase it or reduce it, as appropriate.   There is for example, the idea that the 2008 economic disaster was "the result of printing too much money, which is why we need something like bitcoin.  Actually, not quite.  "Printing" (or "quantitative easing", as the Federal Reserve called it) was actually the solution!
Bitcoin cannot function as, say a national currency, precisely because the volume is limited.   And when the author states that *"if the supply of a currency is limited, and the quantity of goods and services in the economy grows, it follows that the price of those goods and services in that currency must fall"*, my guess is that with a limited volume of money, prices in an expanding economy must literally become smaller---for the very simple reason that there is only so much money to be divided all around.
