Here's the problem:
Institutional money, mainstream newcomers and FOMO investors do not care about the white paper, they do not care about the founder's vision, they don't care if Ver is a pretentious, arrogant asshat. 
They will come to learn that there are faster, cheaper alternatives to bitcoin. Bitcoin devs need to act before it's too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:31
Sounds like an inefficient, problematic system if that's the response to usage...
How can something approach a half trillion market capitilziation and need to be used only in emergency or 'HODL' as an investment vehicle lol...
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:35:49
We need to get a cleaned up version of this stickied. Because the newcomers will indeed panic, especially for those who pulled savings funds to afford whole BTC(s). 
I've been holding since 2011. Survived crashes, dips, hackings, etc. I had over 800 BTC when Mt.Gox happened and the subsequent crash. I panic sold over 80% of my holdings scared like everyone else to miss out at a 'still decent' price before they would drop even lower. I'd have over $15 million if I didn't do that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:05:50
I'm more focused on my 400 BTG and BCH spiking in January. Both should hit major exchanges next month, gold should easily triple in value from the mainstream crowd going with the 'cheaper btc'. 
Hold until mid feb and then dump into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:56
I'm fucking panicking!!!
The bitcoin I bought at $20 in 2011 were worth $7,200 one month ago and that was awesome!
But now, they're only worth $14,600 after hitting $18,000 - $21,000 depending on which exchange you look at. 
Makes sense right? I hate people. 
You can't even be nice to people who are missing this common sense. 
We're more than a 100% increase since this time last month. Yet, people are panicking. Unbelievable. 
I understand there's people who entered at $15k or higher and they're experiencing a loss, but we shouldn't sympathize with them either. You shouldn't be investing/risking/chancing/gambling money that you can't afford to lose. 
I'd rather people not enter than having them enter and panic sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:31
Monero &gt; BTC in discretion and decentralization. 
Ignoring that, decentralization is useless if we can't practically use it. Unless you're going to only use it for the decentralized exchange of large funds, in which if you live in this country you're going to be targeted for tax evasion or deliberately avoiding cash transaction reports (CTR's). 
Go buy one of those bitcoin lambo's with money that Uncle Sam believes to not exist and let me know how long it takes for the IRS and treasury to show up. 
I'd rather have centralized over decentralized if the only option is 6 hours for my amazon payment to go through or six days to send money to my son studying abroad. 
We have critical problems with BTC right now that BTC's functionality does not justify. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:33
The reality of it is this:
Newcomers and institutional money do not care about white papers, founder's intent and vision, etc. 
Whatever is cheaper, faster, and safer - will come out on top. And sadly that is not where BTC stands at the moment and is facing becoming the AOL of the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:18
Nah, I don't want pretentious arrogant Roger Ver to come out on top, but the current state of bitcoin is actual shit. The fee's and tx times are absurd. I want to dump this bCASH (piss off Ver fanboys), but with how badly BTC is performing in terms of its usability, im stuck holding it as a hedge against BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:28
Unless it's an LP700...
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:42:32
I'm holding long. 
But instead of dumping Bcash as I had intended, it's now a necessary hedge to maintain against BTC until the transaction fee's and delays are resolved. 
Once other coins aren't doing what BTC does AND BETTER, I'll sell everything. Until then, hedging the terrible state of our beloved btc. I haven't sold a single BTC yet nor will I any time soon.

If executed at 20k, someone just got $200 million. Minus short term capital gains raping about $80 million of that lol. 
Coinbase doesn't let average joe move that much money, so it had to be an institution setup with coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:18
Exactly. 
The general public and average member of the community isn't here for traditional investment returns like the guys who entered Bitcoin with big money. 
These guys entering with millions, are used to being grateful for a modest annual return of anywhere from 8-18%. 
You can bet that these guys have much more conservative sell orders than one of us has. I'd expect to see A LOT of sell orders at $20,000 - $25,000 market prices. These guys have no desire or dreams of even hitting $50k+ coin values. They're jumping around solely for doubling their investment or even 50% returns. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:16:47

And Satoshi is worth over $11 billion currently. 
If bitcoin's market cap ever matched the global gold reserve's 8 trillion, Satoshi himself will be worth around 487 billion. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:01
Someone sold 10,000 on coinbase. 
Had to be a standing sell order to execute at 20k. Gdax and coinone were both up to $21k before the sell off.

Bitcoin wasn't created to be an investment vehicle bought with a few paychecks with the intention to sell it at a higher value for lambos either...yet, here's 95% of this sub holding until six figures.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:42
I don't think we'd hit 8 trillion in anything less than ten years, if even then. 
I'm just saying in regarding purely figures, if we matched gold's global market value, he'd have a sole worth of nearly half a trillion. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:37
Huge buy opportunity***
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:19
It all depends. You're going to see a lot of final movements for the fourth quarter of 2017 from institutional guys and one should expect a lot of sell offs from profit taking as we dance around the $20k/BTC price. A large enough exit could be coupled with newcomers selling off in fear and a large correction down to even $9k. 
I'm obviously hoping that doesn't happen lol, but given how easily we've entered $16.5k without any ETF, id be happy to rebuy or go in more at $9k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:05
Many are waiting for a correction, but you don't want to also sell and miss a climb to $25k. 
It's all a gamble :(
The futures trading will definitely bring the price down initially. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:59

Awww I'm sure your 0.642927 BTC are going to make you wealthy. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:42
It's so predictable. 
I'm actually kicking myself. I was going to exit all of my BTC at $17.5k for LTC because of the always reliable BTC drop and subsequent alts spike and I was going to hold for a 50% return and then when BTC drops from panicking selling, go in with all of my newly spiked LTC back to BTC. 
Dropped the ball -_-
300 BTC @ $17,371 while LTC was @ $98.02
Talking ~ 53,165 LTC acquired. 
Right now:  LTC @ $155.73
53,165 x $155.73 = $8,279,385
Enter LTC with $5,211,300 worth of BTC yesterday morning and have made $3 million in profit in 24 hours. 
Would've rebought Monday when LTC is likely $185 and BTC is near $10k. 
Fml. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:19:56
This isn't the dip. 
The dip is going to be when investors try to short BTC into the ground and then the knee-jerk reaction of noobs to sell, thinking they're salvaging their money, will be our worst dip and in turn, a great buy op. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:11:48
People are panicking. 
The calm atmosphere of our sub is not indicative nor representative of the masses. The new recent money that was apprehensive to begin with, are seeing what sort of volatility we deal with and are finding out it's not for them. 
You also have established financial sources across the web spreading FUD via headlines and summaries claiming that institutional investors are going to short bitcoin into oblivion. 
Then there's mass saturation of get rich quick scams on social media now for 'the next bitcoin' which always entails and explanation of why bitcoin is 'obsolete', 'outdated', and this 'new coin' is BTC without the problems of BTC blah blah. 
There's a whole recipe for panicking and people are indeed doing so. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:33
Yeah? What can't LTC do that BTC can? And for fraction of the cost and time?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:07:18
Years in the casino business ya come to call them cash transaction reports ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:33
Agreed. 
However, as we continue to rapidly go mainstream, the faults of bitcoin are going to doom it. We're seeing REAL money going into Dash, LTC, Bcash, etc. People are not going to tolerate the current state of BTC literally just because. What's offered by BTC that I can't find in another top ten coin without the current transaction fee's and times?
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:48:11
The problem is 'digital cash' isn't going to come to fruition in the form of Bitcoin, nor does it have a real chance globally. You see what mere ETF rejections or postponements do to the space. You've seen what potential bans in poor nations like India have done to the space. Let Bitcoin or any other crypto asset become a true threat to the fiat system and you're going to see blatant legislation crippling bitcoin, or whatever asset that may be, at that point in time. 
Bitcoin's best chance at longevity is as a store of value, not digital cash. It can't even adequately serve the purpose of digit cash on a global scale anyway. 
My favorite posts are the ones in which people keep citing institutional money  entering the space. Institutional money is not chomping at the bit to enter Bitcoin lol, it's simply not. It's not my opinion, it's fact. Talk to anyone who actually holds a position in finance with a wealth management or VC firm. I'm an options analyst for a wealth management firm and I have friends in the same or similar role with Edward Jones, Glenmede Trust, UBS, and Vanguard. None of us would EVER pitch "buy bitcoin" to a client, ever. All of our firms are establishing crypto desks and forms of custody, however the bulk of institutional money is NOT going into legacy coins. From an investment perspective, Bitcoin is old. Bitcoin struggled to due what it was intended to do under load in Q4 of 2017 - a mere FRACTION of what it would be under if it was used at the level of even AMEX. 
Yes, Bitcoin will see new highs, especially with an ETF and firms acquiring BTC merely as a hedge, but institutional money isn't buying into bitcoin for the long run and that's a fact. And human nature's greed and lust for wealth is going to send people scrambling into alts again as average joe isn't going to be content with his $5k going to $50k in the event bitcoin goes from $6k to $60k. Average Joe is playing for a new home, a luxury car, a retirement stash. That's not coming to anyone who entered bitcoin after 2017 with less than $50k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:34
The transaction fee's and times are already doing that. The alt coin market is exploding in genuine coins like dash, LTC, etc. We need to save bitcoin while we still can. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:42:35
It has a lot to do with the right time considering the article pertains to people who bought purely out of FOMO with ZERO insight to the projects, technology behind the projects, or any care that a retracement/correction was long overdue lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:38
What is the influence for moving forward? Because the current fee's and transaction times aren't okay... I've had full intentions of selling my Bcash (I picture Ver having a stroke every time I say bcash), but honestly after watching the alt market blow up, I'm keeping Bcash as a hedge on my BTC since the public is rapidly learning that hours and days for transactions and excessive fee's.

I've been in since 2010 and an easy part of it was forgetting I had a Armory paper wallet hidden in my room at my mother's house lol.

@_date: 2018-08-20 16:24:53
How so?
Antilex's post is wildly accurate in making fun of the media outlets of past. I've been in the space since 2010 and I can't even come close to remembering how many times major media and official media outlets proclaimed bitcoin was: dead, on it's way out, burst, years away from recovering to it's prior ATH (several times in 2011 and 2014 especially), etc. 
This was the SAME sentiment and posts from the major media all 2016 and all 2017, up until the blow up.

Because Average Joe and the people that comprise the nearly million people in /Bitcoin and /Cryptocurrency are cumulatively worth tens of billions in capital. They're not content with 10-20% returns and they're in it for lambo's and $750k homes.
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:28:36
Same thing it's been for months, we need new volume.
There's too much happy profit taking at the 10, 15, and 20% intervals from recent price drops that is keeping bitcoin sideways. I know several people firsthand who buy OTC via Circle and went in $30 million at $6.4k and happily exited at $7,700 for \~20%.
These guys would be morons not to keep pulling 10-20% profit on their sized capital. They're already at the moon, they're just building steps to Mars every 10-20% swing lol. We need new capital/volume to break past that.
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:02:02
Can someone finally shed light on this?
Are these people getting convicted by portraying themselves as a broker? Charging fees in addition to the sale itself?
Is what they're doing different then simply selling their bitcoin at current market value?
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:18:48
In that scenario, Bitcoin is irrelevant. You’re talking basically post-apocalypse level lawlessness and despair. If bitcoin has value, my group and I will just murder you and take it since it’ll be end of world times. Mass disease will spread through water ways and food, financial collapse and ruin, etc.

@_date: 2017-08-12 17:32:22
1.) There's a lot more room for growth and repeated value doubling when the market cap was $15 million as opposed to $60 billion. 
2.) That argument is not comparable. Entering at $5 is choosing 1 BTC over a beer. Entering at $5,000 is choosing 1 BTC over 15 car payments for the average car owner. 
The price of one bitcoin is discouraging to 99% of people who want to invest for profit. Everyone that I ever talk BTC to assumes they have to buy at least one btc and even then, they don't believe the reality of a substantial (real world, not Lamborghini talk) return on their investment. 
Investing is a lot more appealing/lucrative to the general population when you're talking 8-20% returns with high volatility on 750 mBTC as opposed to 0.75btc.

That is solely due to the fact that I saved a notepad with my wallet info on a SD card that I saved a ton of old relationship shit on and hid from my ex at my moms house. 
If I was in conscious possession of my btc over those years of growth, I absolutely would've sold out when they would've been a $10k profit overall. 
Hindsight is 20/20.

I sold 30% of my holdings at $4,020 yesterday. That 30% was a rebuy at a correction around $2,670 after hitting and selling @ $3,200. 
I'll be spending the entire resultant fiat at a correction of 3,600.

This past year, I'd say 40+ friends and family have asked me about bitcoin and maybe 200 from social media. None of them give a shit about the amazing technology beneath it or controlling their own money. They want to get in, make money and convert back to fiat for Louis Vuitton bags and cars.

What’s a more sound investment at the moment? The housing market and stock market are both on the brink of collapse, to proportions of that like 2008 or worse. 
I genuinely believe we’re in the infancy of crypto, and that when securities come crashing down, a SMALL percent of market players will gain some exposure in crypto and even a small percent of that money would propel us to new highs. 
Also, for my specific situation, a lot of my profit on the alts were in 2018 in the beginning and middle of January, that I bought in the first few days of January. So getting raped at 37% plus some state obligations, wasn’t appealing at the moment lol.

The only people calling for the end, $0, dead, etc. are scorned or jealous individuals.
People who bought the high, hoping for lambos with zero actual research, or people who can't put in a discernible amount of money worth even risking.
I mean, I can't blame the FOMO mentality - who doesn't want easy money? But at the same time, they deserve zero pity. If you bought at even $12,000, you entered an asset that saw a 400% gain in less than a mere 90 days without EVER seeing a discernible retracement. There's nobody to blame but themselves.
We're at a mix of capitulation and anger in terms of the market psychology trend.

I've been in since 2011.
I played with alts in December of last year, took 165 of my total BTC and went into alts. 
Those 165 btc put into alts peaked at 450 btc value in January, for about a $7 million total. It's now worth $280k lulz.

If you really believe that we haven’t long passed complacency, then there’s no reasoning with you.

@_date: 2018-11-25 16:12:33
You're a millionaire, right?
How is it you thought of something as a good investment at a 500% peak in price over a short 90 days?
How is it you only had $900 to put in? Was your goal to sell at $2,700 for a $1,800 profit? That just seems like a waste of time and complicating your tax obligation as an investor, to jump into crypto for a measly $1,800. Which to even net, would require bitcoin to have gone to nearly $45,000 in price lol.

How fast is gold?
How come my banks make me wait three days for a wire of my own money if I don't send it within a certain time? How come when I did a $1.2 million wire from Wells Fargo to Vanguard, I had to spend three weeks explaining myself and providing all sorts of financial history to the treasury and IRS explaining myself over my own assets?
It's garbage? Lol...
What's the current transaction speed and fee?
Sure, not ideal for your cup of coffee this morning, but as a store of value or buying a house? Absolutely.
Does your 'studying the hell out of it' trump the analysis and study by massive wealth management firms like Fidelity? I mean, they obviously studied it at a far greater degree than you or I, and they've decided to invest time, money, and resources into establishing Fidelity Digital Asset Services for large client money. They're not launching it for retail kiddies from Reddit hoping to buy aventadors and huracans. They have immense demand amongst their $7 trillion worth of clients, and that's why they're building it.
Follow the big money.
Sure, maybe it will all die and hit $0 - one day. But, it's not going to happen before Wallstreet and the big banks get the chance to hyper inflate the fuck out of it and make their money. And if you believe a meager $800 billion GLOBALLY, with Asia owning MOST of it, was wallstreet's involvement, you're on drugs.

If you believe in bitcoin, DC average down then. You should be thrilled, right? You missed the boat when you decided to pull the trigger in January of 2018, so why aren't you happy that prices are retraced down this low for you to enter now?

How about Fidelity launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services?
I think a wealth management conglomerate that oversees $7 trillion in assets, knows more than you, I, and everyone else.
They're not getting involved because only a few million bucks are interested. They're not getting involved because of Reddit moon-lambo kiddies. Their services aren't open to average joe's on the internet who want crypto.
They're mobilizing and building because they're 100% confident in massive returns ahead. Or they'd sit content with their current net profits of billions a year.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:22:42
Yeah, you're right. Crypto is dead, we peaked.

No, I call people like him poor when we can deduce that their uncalled for resentment and negative hostility towards supporters is a result of jealousy. 
When you immerse yourself into a crypto community, only to be negative and confront any/every positive post with denial and negativity, that’s someone who’s resentful to their core. And people who are well off, aren’t resentful towards investors/believers in a market or spend time bashing them. They’d go on about their life. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:37:31
It costs money to offer those services.
Fidelity is launching FDAS (Fidelity Digital Asset Services) because they have large demand amongst clients. You think they're the only one?
I've sat in on conferences and dinners at the institutional level since 2013. Wall Street does give a shit. They want to hyper inflate the market, reap profits, control and prevent any redistribution of wealth, etc.
Fidelity has over $7 trillion of assets under management. They literally don't need to expand their ventures, nor do they need to get into the crypto realm at all. However, they are. I trust their research, more than average joe's negativity.
I'd honestly be right there with you if we didn't have Bakkt, Fidelity, Goldman, etc. all throwing their hats into the mix. You have BlackRock talking ETF's if the space matures in terms of clarity regarding tax obligations and regulatory oversight.
The space saw $830 billion - which is nothing. And vast majority of that was Asian markets. You have the likes of fidelity and others entering the space...the market is going to dwarf it's previous. Will it be here to stay? Who knows. But we stand to make immense profits when they hyperinflate the balls out of it.

But while Glenmede, Edward Jones, UBS, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, and countless other wealth management firms/financial institutions are holding conferences and entering positions, I'll remain bullish.
Fidelity manages over $7 trillion in assets. They're not entering the space with custody services related to crypto for anything less than guaranteed profits and customer demand. They don't need to take a gamble or a risk, and their services aren't open to the likes of the get rich kiddies in the crypto space. They're expending the resources, time, money, staffing, etc. to establish Fidelity's FDAS program because they have large demand for it from real money.

I’m not talking about blindly accepting crypto as a form of payment. Give spankchain a look over. And the cam models using their protocol is growing rapidly. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:04:47
Yeah, to the noobs.
Anyone with half a brain and actual market experience has been calling for $5k since late Spring.
I, admittedly, have been calling for $5k as the bottom with maybe a flash down to $4,800. As the technicals change, I see us hitting $3,200.
Either way, we're in or knocking on the door of capitulation. The long-established market psychology trends are playing out to a T. Look at reddit for example and as a sample size. All the moon-boizzzz. Have you ever seen this much FUD in the sub? Is it not exceedingly obvious that is the depression phase? I mean, there's several dozen posts on the first page alone about how people could have better spent their money, how they're sick about what it's currently worth.
The reversal is going to be fast, I hope people have their fiat ready :)

* Exaggerated.
* Your point? Penny stocks still exist and garner tens of billions every year, despite decades of warnings.
* Weird, I have friends who are long on Bitcoin and other crypto who are analysts for Glenmede, UBS, and Edward Jones. I guess they're young and lack market knowledge?
* Prone to crash? I didn't know corrections following retail FOMO and hype equates to 'crashing to rock bottom'.

It could be worse, they could be broke liberals angry at everyone who has money and a shot at a windfall.
None of the negativity here is facing reality. The reality is that adoption and awareness is at an all time high, institutional involvement is at a point where none of us who've been hear since 2010/2011 would have imagined. CBOE throwing in ETF's? BlackRock saying they have large customer interest, but need the space to be more clear and regulated? Fidelity launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services because they have large enough demand amongst the $7 trillion in customer assets under management? Bakkt?
I mean, those things coupled with the fact we've had retracements and 'collapses' this large and larger in the past, gives more reason to the bitcoin proponents than the antagonists.
The FUD spewing people in this thread, don't even have a horse in the race. Just empty claims that they've sold, or that they never even owned. Why devote time to a group then? They're clearly resentful and jealous to take the time to oppose crypto supporters, when they're supposedly not even in the game.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:14:51
Right, and if those people took your advice when I got into crypto in 2011 or any of the years prior to 2017, they'd all have missed out on a lot of money.
Yes, just jealousy and resentment.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:36:45
I'm right there with ya.
Just sit back and enjoy the FUD and negative sentiment. If you really would like to calm your nerves (if you have any) take the time travel approach and immerse yourself into the forums and articles from 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, etc. and read how confident everyone was in proclaiming that it was dead, never going higher, etc.
People claiming they're finance professionals, analysts, their 'analyst friend from Goldman said it's dead', etc. The arrogance, the jealousy-driven calls that it was a bubble that finally popped for good, etc.
This time around is no different. 
The haters are the people who missed the very early days, or the people who can't afford to enter even at today's prices. They simply want to watch the world burn, since they can't partake in it.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:29:50
'As you fuckers?'
I've been in the space since 2011 lmao.
I'm here on found money lol. I'm so far in the green that the market can fold in half and I'd still be in the seven figures. The best part is I even road the hopes and dreams of the morons that you're citing - the tron and verge kiddies who made it possible for me to enter verge at .009 with 45 btc and dump at .21, or similar with tron.
The market will see a new ATH in total market cap :)
Fidelity isn't putting money, staffing, and time into building their 'Fidelity Digital Asset Services' because they're gambling or hoping for interest. It's not open to the likes of the moon-lambo jackasses of this sub. It's being built because there's massive big money interest in the space, that has yet to enter and wants to enter.

Given the countless posts in the sub during the recent breakdown over the past few weeks, we're definitely heading toward the depression phase.
"I can't believe I fell for it."
"My $20k is worth $2k, it's sickening."
"I bought the hype, I should have known better."
"$5k would have been a nice vacation, instead it's worth $900 now :("
This + hash rate + volume steadily increasing + institutional involvement (Bakkt, Fidelity launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services, CBOE throwing up ETF's)...you guys are really panicking?
Shit, I'm thrilled.
Maybe it takes being involved in the space since 2011, or surviving MtGox and SilkRoad collapses, but these are exciting times. Those of us from the early days know how huge it is that Bitcoin/crypto is even regularly discussed by CNBC, Forbes, Business Insider, Wallstreet Journal, etc.
I get that it's hard, especially mentally, to watch your assets fall. I can't tell anyone what to do, or what they should do with their money. However, if you GENUINELY entered the space because of use-cases, because of believing in the future of crypto, I don't understand how you can't be taking advantage of the current prices that you were too late for at the end of 2017. The likes of Fidelity, are not entering the space for a gamble. They're entering the space because they anticipate an immense market ahead. Look at the OTC markets.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:28:09
You're talking about maturity and learning about the world, yet you're a Trump-whining liberal lol.

@_date: 2018-11-25 15:59:08
I mean, you see it first hand.
If you were really involved since 2011, you'd understand how significant is for the likes of BlackRock to event mention the word Bitcoin, let alone acknowledge that they have large customer demand. If there was regulatory clarity and clarity regarding tax obligations, they'd be in already.
Never does? You have CBOE throwing ETF's at the SEC, and you have the largest wealth management firm in the western hemisphere launching cryptocurrency custody solutions. Fidelity launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services isn't 'Wallstreet' involvement to you? They don't NEED to enter the space, they don't need to take a gamble on it. Their services aren't open to random crypto kiddies hoping for moon lambos. They're getting involved because they have large demand for it from clients and because they see immense profits ahead, or they wouldn't waste time touching it.
I'm not saying the market won't die in the future, but the space will see several trillion and big money lining their pockets before it does. A measly $840 billion, with a majority held by Asia, isn't the peak lol.

Bitcoin itself, would depend on it's actual usability as a store of value. We see that it's ease of transfer and fee's for sizeable movements is far more efficient than gold.
How about utility tokens? I mean, even the largest bitcoin bears and antagonists acknowledge that blockchain technology is indeed the future. So projects like Enigma enabling any company using a blockchain system to have private/secret contracts on their chain, stand to make a ton of money.
Gifto taking over the virtual gifting market.
FileCoin, etc.
Hell, there's even projects targeting cam girls like SpankChain. It all sounds like a joke until it acquires a chunk of the $4 billion adult webcam market. 
It's sad that people think every project/coin/token is just trying to be the next bitcoin. You have projects like Enigma, Gifto, Crypterium, etc. that will be huge if blockchain technology is indeed the future and equate to immense profits for token holders.

Why would price reflect? You don't enter a position no matter how positive you are about it, when all indicators show it going down. It's not a necessity play for them, so yeah, you wait until what your analysts perceive to be the bottom.

My CFP with Vanguard advises me to pay off any outstanding debts and to acquire any reality interests that I have. He then advised me to consolidate out of most altcoins. 
He’s very confident in a several trillion dollar market cap in the space by 2021 “at the latest”. 
My total assets under management enable me to live comfortably off of about $180,000 a year from my investments. If crypto busts, I’m still in good shape.

Interesting maths.
If you bought at $12,000 due to FOMO, yes, the price was up 400% at the time they decided to pull the trigger.
9/15/2017:   $2,950
12/5/2017: $12,000
Is that not 400% gain in ~90 days? Anyone who thought to themselves that would be a good time to buy, is a moron. They'll get even and profit in the long run, but as a short term/near future play, they were greedy, FOMO-driven morons.

The quick-hit profits trading dog shit like verge and tron, were consolidated into projects I believe in like Monero, Dash, Enigma, and others.
I'm here on found money, bitcoin would have to go to $16 for me to finally have lost my own money. I live comfortably, I own several small businesses and have a comfortable career.

Which is why projects like Enigma that cater to businesses/enterprises utilizing blockchain technology, can still yield massive profits.
Sure, bitcoin needs to become a store of value. As it stands, it's fee's and transaction fees has shot itself in the foot to be a global currency for small retail purchases. However, blockchain technology is indeed the future. So why not take advantage of the legitimate companies that are catering to the technology and not trying to be the next bitcoin? Enigma? It's MPC protocol to enable private contracts for any blockchain? Massive use case there.
Look at the more specific markets that can benefit from blockchain technology. Gifto has cornered the virtual gifting market, which while lame as hell to us westerners, is a MASSIVE market in Asia pushing upwards of $10 billion annually and only growing.
Neblio and their catering to enterprises?

It makes sense for residual income that you have available for investing, to be put into BTC and held long. 
The sentiment on this board doesn't account for inherent spending on goods beyond bare essentials. If I buy a MacBook on overstock with btc and replace the BTC with fiat at the same time I spent my BTC, people on this board are still like "but that's $2k of btc that could be $20k when we get to $56,000/BTC!"
You're entirely right about a lucrative, large ROI %. However, those who are late to the party refuse to acknowledge that they're not going to experience ROI's that large of a return. Well, for those of us with a business or finance background the realistic ROI's are still massive and beyond anything we'd see in the S&amp;P or NASDAQ. But let's be real, most of the posters here aren't here for an amazing 100% return, especially since most post $2,000/BTC newcomers on this board don't even have 1 entire BTC.
These people think somehow that their $1,300 investment at even $1,000 market rate is going to turn into lambo money. We need WILD expansion and mainstream adoption of BTC to see even a $50,000 BTC. People don't realize that in terms of global money, a $100 billion market cap is a drop in a bucket and easily attainable, I mean Bill Gates himself is almost worth that. But to go from $100 billion market cap to 1 TRILLION is a massive deal and an uphill battle. These 'HODLers' who invested $5,800 for 1 BTC fail to realize the immense gap between $100b market cap and $1T, which they need to have occur for even a $53,000 profit. Yet, they're hodling for lambos according to them.

Because China is evil and it's not a stretch for them to sentence bitcoin traders to ten years manual labor in a prison camp if they wanted to.

Yeah, great. Let's give politicians even more motivation and spite to attack bitcoin. 
I can see US regulation now:
- All registered merchants and businesses operating with a federal EIN must retain all customer information for cryptocurrency transactions (ip/mac/delivery address for purchases/order details). 
- A cash transaction report must be filed with the treasury/IRS for all cryptocurrency transactions totaling over X or more than X in one transaction. 
Or just throw intimidating legislation around it so major merchants and vendors don't want to touch it. 
Or ultimately make it illegal to transact "due to high risk association with illicit activity" or some other BS terminology to vilify bitcoin at the federal level.

Bitcoin and crypto in general is dropping because its overvalued and from overspeculation. 
We had legit growth. 
We had legit global expansion and implementation. 
We got mainstream ATTENTION and the noobs/get rich quick money got pumped in by everyone not wanting to miss the get rich train. 
Now that the scaling debate moment of action is approaching quickly, we saw the decline we expected and then the noobs above panicked and sold out before, in their minds, they lost everything. We're seeing an exit of the get rich quick money and the safe hedging from long holders who are taking some profits incase post-August 1st never recovers.

They unfortunately can do a lot to 'regulate'. 
1.) Crack down and play puppeteer with exchanges like in China. 
2.) Criminalize the person to person sale like here in the USA with 'illegal money transmission'. 
3.) All large corporations except google are in the government's pocket. So when mainstream adoption occurs, expect to see mainstream mandatory reporting on customers who purchase goods costing more than X $ with Bitcoin. I can guarantee you when Bitcoin is large enough, companies like Amazon, EBay, etc. will absolutely report and log the customer information such as item, IP, wallet sending address, amount of BTC, customer delivery info etc. 
When Bitcoin truly becomes mainstream, it will be regulated well beyond what we want it to be, while still remaining 'decentralized' and there's nothing we can do about it in the sense of the above.

It seems that shapeshifting is the new mainstay of securing anonymity. 
It's really a god damn shame with the darknet markets. Whenever I go to cash out one day, I'll likely have to piece out my bitcoin and utilize it as cash as opposed to ever cashing out. 
I mixed mine several times years ago when everyone was hyping up 'dirty coins from pedofiles' and the silkroad bust. I'd likely never be able to prove my original ownership from several years back now. The government would love that. 'Civil forfeiture' all day. They don't even have to prove your money is illicit, as long as you can't soundly prove ownership it's theirs.

The mainstream you want adopting Bitcoin won't go to OpenBazaar. The 99.9% who don't understand what Bitcoin even is, won't care to be regulated or not. That's the problem we face. 
We will not get widespread adoption at a significant level while having no regulation. The consumer will always choose the path of least resistance and the cheapest method possible. We need the average consumer to get the % of the market we hope to retain to see btc value over $10k.
Sadly, a tiny portion of first-world societies care about centralized banking and not even being in possession of their own money.
Those of us smart enough to operate securely will simply have to do so while the masses conform to whatever Bitcoin regulation is created.

Too many fundamental factors at play to really predict when...
Big money wants in, but big money needs two primary things:
* Complete clarity across the entire space in regards to tax obligations.
* Insured, reputable custodian services.
There's no service or method of assurance and peace of mind for UHN individuals to pull the trigger on entering the space. These people aren't going to call up their CFP's at Edward Jones, or Fidelity, or UBS, and say "Hey Bob, I want to get some exposure in crypto. The concept makes sense and I think we can see some huge returns from what I'm reading. I need to liquidate $5 million from our holdings to play with and I'm going to buy one of these Ledger or Trezor things and hold it there."
There's tens of billions of dollars that want in, but they need to literally be able to call their CFP and say "put me into X" - the end. Or the portfolio managers themselves who want exposure for x% of their client assets, but their only option right now is in-house storage via hardware wallets, on an exchange with no oversight or insurance, paper wallets, etc.
It seems so simple to us, but when you're talking about $x billion in client assets, you're not going to go create a wallet on some service you never heard of, and then go pound recovery phrases or BIP39 numbers onto a titanium plate and throw it in a vault somewhere. They need institutional level custody services, and that's why we're seeing the likes of Fidelity launching Fidelity Digital Assets. As these things launch, we're going to see large entries into the space.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:04:18
You're comparing broad historic trends, to actual solutions in the space?
Fidelity has over $7 trillion in assets under management - they had absolutely zero need to launch Fidelity Digitial Asset Services. They did so because they have strong enough client interest in the space.
I utilize Vanguard and Edward Jones for my wealth management services and my CFP's with them have stated exactly the same - there's tens of billions of dollars that want into the space, however there's still confusion on tax obligations and the biggest issue is fully insured custody solutions. Their UHN clients who want exposure can't get in, until theres a reputable, large enough name willing to be responsible for managing and holding these assets.
Bakkt - Not as exciting or important to me as Fidelity.
The biggest sign is Yale announcing earlier this year they've established a $400m cryptocurrency fund. Yale is the gold standard in finance, globally. It's quite sad how little this is cited in the crypto community, which really shows just how few actual finance people are in the space. Anyone with an actual finance background, would see how big Yale's involvement actually is.

I've been hodling since 2011 &gt;.&lt;
As long as it stays above $28/btc I can't complain ��

I'm not trying to beat a dead horse, and this comment is more geared to that lurkers and new readers to the thread:
Use an EXCHANGE to EXCHANGE. 
Then move everything off. 
Even a hot wallet like Blockchain.info is substantially safer.
I know guys who've operated ONLY via blockchain.info, enabled 2-factor authentication and spend passwords and have yet to lose ANYTHING. They've got $200k+ on there. 
Realistically, if you've got any decent value in your hands, it should be on a hardware or offline paper wallet. 
Crypto is going to be like repeat lottery winnings for the government under civil forfeiture laws. You NEED to control your keys and unless you can show the direct, explicit origin for your initial purchasing/obtaining of ALL crypto you own, you need to separate your long term holdings from your actively used crypto balance in the event Uncle Sam moves to seize the quantity &amp; wallet you're operating out of. I buy dips and sell at 15-18% recovery from the dip. I have an allotted balance on a hot wallet and an exchange ONLY for that purpose. My holdings and entire savings of crypto, have absolutely no link to that exchange or hot wallet. In the event an exchange like coinbase decides to freeze me because I somehow got flagged and then big brother moved for 'civil forfeiture', that's all they're getting.

Yes, but if someone said that at $2 reaching 1,000x to hit $2k, they had validity because of how tiny of the global fair market they need to account for. Now to go from 2,500 to $100k or even to $50k, you need a substantial piece of the global market exchange as opposed to the raindrop $2k a coin is.

I agree, but a problem with those substantial portions of the worlds population, the last thing they'll approach is volatility. Individuals in their position feel safer with a physical horrible national dollar being worth X, then the volatility we see with BTC. 
I think litecoin is going to thrive for a little while as people use it as a primary medium to shapeshift through to use BTC anonymously.

Nobody knows.
Follow the money - it's coming.
Yale is the gold standard of finance direction and involement. Anyone with a finance background understands the symbolism of Yale establishing a $400m crypto fund earlier this year, yet it's rarely ever cited in this sub or any other crypto community \*sigh\*.
Fidelity and others launching crypto custody solutions... Fidelity has $7+ trillion in assets under management. They have NO NEED to get involved in crypto. However, they're launching Fidelity Digital Asset Services. Now why would they expend the time and resources to create such a service? They have immense demand.
It's no big deal for you or I to go buy a Nano or a Trezor, link a bank account and throw in what we perceive to be a serious amount of money to us and we believe it to be 'safe' because we have it on a hardware wallet in our control. But when you're a 55 year old UHN individual with UBS, Vanguard, Glenmede, Goldman, JP Morgan, Fidelity, Edward Jones, Schwab, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America or any of the other dozens of wealth management firms - you have NO exposure to crypto because your CFP isn't going to put $10 million in a trezor and hold your keys. They need insured, monitored, reputable custody services. Fidelity launching their digital asset services is going to be huge for volume in the space and fresh capital.

I'm not bashing anyone by my OP. 
I just feel the excess of lambo hopefuls speculating for a windfall are detrimental to the technology.  
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:39:52
I used to visit some boards related to PC game mods and one of the guys used to sell trainers and bots and started accepting BTC's. 
I recovered my device with my keys after seeing BTC on some web headlines after the first crash following mtgox. I forgot about them until then. 
I'm not holding anything worth retiring, id exit if they hit $5k in the next 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:32:32
The thing is I'm not very wrong. 
My comments have nothing to do with the past.  
My point is, you're comparing figures now that have a massive correlation to the way the global economy works.
$1 to $3,000 is nothing considering the total market cap at $3,000 is feasible. 
Now, some noob entering Bitcoin hoping to see the same gain, is simply ignoring the global economy and its limits. Bitcoin went from $1 at a point to $3,000 - meaning 3,000 times its value! Let's say someone is hoping for even half of that - 1,500. That would mean the current $2,500 would become $3.75 million per 1 btc.  
Let's use Van-Petersen's aggressive, highly optimistic figures and analysis needed for 1 btc to becoming $100k (40 times the current price). "...Van-Petersen is assuming cryptocurrencies in general – not just bitcoin – will account for 10 percent of the average daily volumes (ADV) of fiat currency trade in 10 years. Foreign exchange ADV currently stands at just over $5 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Ten percent of $5 trillion is $500 billion. This is the ADV that cryptocurrencies could have. Bitcoin will account for 35 percent of that market share, which would that $175 billion of the $500 billion figure, he said. This would mean that $175 billion worth of bitcoin would be traded every day. Also, Van-Petersen then implies that bitcoin's market capitalization would be ten times the average daily volume, giving a figure of $1.75 trillion for the market cap. The current figure is around $37.8 billion, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million which is expected to be reached by the year 2140. In 10 years, the analyst thinks that there will be 17 million bitcoin in circulation, up from the current 16.3 million figure.
If the potential 17 million of bitcoins in supply is divided by the $1.75 trillion market cap estimate, then each bitcoin would be worth just over $100,000."
That's a scenario that requires A LOT to occur on a global scale, VAST public acceptance of Bitcoin, expansive integration in major retailers accepting and advertising and a HUGE amount of the general public willing to trade their fiat for Bitcoin. Meaning you need average joe auto mechanic to even be on board with obtaining btc. 
People don't stop and realize the total financial market on a global scale and what's required of it for Bitcoin to have a value of even $25k/btc. Going from $1/btc to $3,000/btc (3,000x) is actually easier than $2,500/btc going up merely 10x. 
If you got into btc with anything less than $100,000 and anything higher than $1,000/btc, you're not going to have anywhere near $1 million in Bitcoin, sorry.

I've been 'hodling' since 2011...it's worked great for me :)
Anyone hodling, should also be utilizing crypto for any possible purchases they can be using it for via that fiat.
Traders make money, and I'll act upon some charts in a more stable market. But most of my positions are held out of my belief in the project's service/product in the future of this space.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:43:35
The best part is there's people who think they'll even be worth $100k, let alone the crowd who thinks theyll be worth $1m ��
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:38:41
Which is all true. 
$12k is feasible. 
The problem is, probably 90% of the btc community that got to the party after 2016, is thinking they're going to have success story when Bitcoin becomes worth $200,000. 
The global currency requirements for $100k/btc to happen aren't going to happen. The people who have new money flooding into crypto don't realize that 3,000x gain from $1 to $3,000 is actually insanely easier than $3,000 just going up 10x. People can't stomach the 'late to the party' aspect of Bitcoin and think their $800 is going to buy them a $300,000 car in 5-10 years. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:16:01
That just makes you even more pathetic for spending time here in the sub lol.
Resentful you didn't buy back in 2011? Angry you can't put any sizeable capital into the space? Which is it? There's obviously some deep motivation for you to spend time in a sub that has no bearing on your life.
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:01:42
Awww but I got in at $2,830 and want to buy a lambo and have a glock in my rariiiii
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:17:31
It will not dwarf the market collapse of 2008 -\_-
Let's say it sees the same magnitude, or even a little worse. Most clients and firms recovered to their pre-2008 levels in about a year and a half.
The FUD is mindblowing. 
Anyway, I'm hoping for a small hedge from institutional players to gain some additional exposure. Even 3-5% of wall street money gaining some exposure in crypto, would propel us to crazy new highs.
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:41:56
I fell from Aventador Roadster to used Murcielago this week ����
I wish I had enough to legitimately buy a super car. It'd be more like "lambo or nice house", while being broke after lol. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:44:25
Redditor for three days because when it comes to the crypto in my possession I prefer staying on Tails and tor in all regards until my final exit and tax reckoning. 
Also, just because of the cited timeframe of 2011, I never once claimed to have bought a lot at that time frame. btc/alts combined im below 7 figures, even if they hit $5k a piece. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:54:13
Believe me, I hope so lol
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:08:21
I'm aware of that, as myself are one of them (not seven figures). 
My comment is about the people entering the btc market TODAY investing $10,000 or less and think they're going to make similar gains. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:41:35
What's your long term play at a $2,700 single coin? Unless you're one of the "I'm gonna buy a Lamborghini from crypto gainzzzz!" kiddies, you'd see the realistic 5 year projections. In five years, you're hoping for a $2,700 investment to make you a making you an 85% return. Which, an 85% return is absolutely amazing, but that puts your $2,700 investment at a value of $5,000. A $460 annual return isn't worth my time. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:34:05
It's doing phenomenal.
It's holding stable in the $2,000's when many of us were praying to find support at $1,100 after a correction not too long ago. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:07:57
How high did you buy in, that you're involved in a crypto group yet claim it's dead?
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:49:22
Hindsight is 20/20 and driving me mad. 
My original discovery of Bitcoin was a result of a script kiddie selling bots and trainers for PC games back then. I only bought enough to pay for $10-$25 trainers back then. 
It's a nice come up, but far from lending millions ��
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:10:16
I like how people are entering BTC for profit today lol. I'm 100% team btc, but you're not seeing any form of windfall gain or 'bought a lambo' profit if you're entering today. 
I like the guys who are 'HODL' with a few hundred bucks ��.
Hoping to turn that to $2k in the absolute best 5 year scenario? ����‍♂️
