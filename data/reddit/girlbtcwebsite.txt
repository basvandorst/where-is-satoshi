There have been three Boys in the last three rounds
Maybe this is a right time to just simply bet 0.1 on the girl side , and win the whole boy and extra bonus(0.03btc).
Currrent Question 31 worth 0.03 btc , to make it convenient, we will send the btc to you every two quesitons fixed.
And than start Question 32,33,34,35.....withou any delay with more bonus.
Someone PMed me , why do you giving out money so heavily ? you hasn't made a cent. 
The answer is " it is cheaper than adv., All I　need is players."
In other word : I am buying player,I believe a real player worth at least 0.5 btc for a success site.
I　can do adv easily without wasting a lot of time thinking and pasting quesions here. but it never bring us real players. and player ,especially new player ,just come  and check the history of the site they don't know.
So we need the history, the rounds history with high and real bets. and it is the only way , we ,  become popular.
My bugdet for each round is 1 btc , so come and get it .
I　once paid 6btc/week to adv (including on this forum), but it didn't bring me even a player. I was so sad. I'd like to give this 6 btc to real players.  which will at least get a good wager.
That's all thx,

10% of your net bet, totally 10 btc
Q: Why don't we just simply run a dice site or bustabit-like site? 
A: Because all those games are PvH. in that case, all the games has house edge and you play longer. You lose more.
Q: Why are we promoting with 10 btc giveaway?
A: To give this bonus to real players is more effective than do any adv. and advertisement is too expensive. You can do little things with that 10 btc. But by giving it to real player, it will bring up real players in more numbers.
Q: How to get the 10 btc giveaway.
1. You must be a player (at least 0.01btc net playing in current round)
2. You must have reply our Facebook with your address and had Facebook account 1 year ago
3. You get 10% of your net bet every round.  Until the 10 btc out.
We will list all the 10 btc. You can also check it on the block chain. Yes of course, you can bet 100btc and then get the whole 10btc bonus in a round.

I think  I get the point , why you guys not playing it .while the bitcoin showing in the real address
Point 1: you don't trust me or my site ,or it is really hard for you to trust anyone.    of course it is also very hard for me to trust you.
Point 2: you may think I can control the result , I am playing myself.
as the round 2 comes out so slows , I want to fix the above two problem(points)
My English is not very good. but  I　am so seriously with it .
firstly we finalize the round 2 after 2 hours.  now(6:00 AM).  if you want to play ,please be hurry.
secondly I want to resolve the Point 2 question which seemed easier to be done.
we judge the last character of  the hash of blocks  instead of what it was   , For example Block 
Block   
000000000000000001de8b63f0f1d9f5e495fa26f66c4be2d1aa0989ba8411ae  last character e here for boy
the point 1 is hard to be fixed, even people can not trust your dad or mom.  so the only solution for this is time
and if you have any good advise, please tell me , if needed I can public my personal info. but it doesn't make sense.
even big company (MtGox), bank (currupt),government  is not worth your trust. How about me?
the current solution is ,we trust the data the trans of the two address.

Q:so for example, there is 10btc on boy and 1btc on girl, what will happen if the boy wins the round? if girl wins the round you would only pay 1btc and keep 9btc from the boy?
A:in this situation ,if the boy wins , the first 1 btc will be doubled , so the boy side will be returned 11 btc. if the girl wins , the boy's 9 btc will be returned and the girl get 2 btc returned. in other word , the site is not betting with you . and additional ,if you bet 1-10btc , the fee will be 1%. thats if the boy wins 10.99 btc return if the girl wins 1.99 to the girlside , 9 to boy side
we are coding it and make it running with big players ,like 10btc 100btc 1000btc 10000....per round ,and thx
