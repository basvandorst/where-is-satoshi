A lot of people are scared of cryptocurrencies, because they will change the status quo. They are anonymous and regulation or taxation is made impossible, that's their problem and their benefit. I can see where those people come from taxes and regulation play a huge role in modern economics and can be necessary for a economy and society to be intact. They talk about not beeing backed, just beeing numbers or hackable because they are scared to infrom the public about their real properties.

You can love blockchain, it's potential to change the future to a better, and still accept that there are problems that come with it, that need to be resolved to benefit the common good.
 Everyone should be worried about tax evasion and corruption benefited by crypto currencies, because wealthy people are able to abuse it the most.
This is a side effect of crypto currencies that is problematic for everybody, but sadly not solvable.
Trying to justify tax evasion is ridicolous, taxes are mendatory for a society to work, to handle public goods problems and to have some kind of redistribution.
This kind of conspiracy make-belive is childish:

Also from germany and polls show that people that don't live in areas with a lot of refugees feel more threatened and scared.
