I don’t think so. Read the whole paragraph 
“Bitcoin’s demise would have few spillover effects on the ‘real world,’ since the market for this cryptocurrency is still quite small in size,” he said. “As a result, we believe that the risks to financial stability stemming from bitcoin are negligible -- at least as of today.”

No their logic is that bitcoin blowing up will not so much to other markets. Bitcoin can be a bubble without being big. Beanie babies didn’t cause a financial meltdown either and they were a “bubble”

Honestly I would take low and stable inflation. Your base currency should not be a speculative asset.

Read this but replace “token” with scammy mcscam. More interesting that way.

How did this make him look stupid?

I don’t think this is right. This is one function of a bank, but banks have been around long before credit cards.  Saying that is their primary business just isn’t true. 
They have several functions but one of the main ones is giving loans to people and businesses.  In fact if you look up banking in many texts it is simplified to taking in deposits and loaning them out at a higher rate.  
Bitcoin has no answer to this.

I am disagreeing with it being the primary purpose. Sure it is the way you interact with the bank the most but each of those interactions is tiny the primary purpose of banks is loans. Sure I only get 1 mortgage but that thing sticks around for 30 years.

Reread the article. Nothing made them illegitimate. 
It’s not backed by anything: ya so what other currencies are backed by the full faith and credit of a country.  This one isn’t. 
It’s a bubble:  so what bubbles can be good and if I hand pick some past examples people made some money (ignore pets.com)
It’s like tulips: your argument is invalid because I found a snarky tweet 
Explain again how this makes Jamie look stupid.

This honestly doesn’t make any sense. Why wouldn’t the rich just buy coins?
