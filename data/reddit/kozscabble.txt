You sound educated on the subject, so glad for your detailed conclusion based on you losing money and the all caps.

well we broke 9500 at least for now

curious, maybe dumb question, but why does everyone assume that if it breaks a whole, fun number like 7000, 8000, 9000 that it will continue in either direction of the number it broke, arent all price points just what its worth? like why does it seem more important if its a 1000s number instead of say 7745 or 6823? or is it just a way of simplifying it because we don't actually understand, so 1000s seem easier to understand.

 too look at the fun numbers haha, so yeah I get what you are saying, just a human reasoning thing that is natural

I get that the crypto market is ridiculously volatile right now, but it seems like everyone assumes that we SHOULD BE able to just watch the price go up and down and if it doesn't it means something specific or it's boring, most more traditional investments  barely go up and down minute to minute or even day to day week to week.  Is there a chance that eventually there will be stability in crypto? instead of it looking like a 8000 dollar penny stock? sincerely curious, I feel it doesn't naturally HAVE to be like it has been

I hope you're joking lol literally just asked a normal question that I haven't seen talked about before...

can confirm, my roommate graduated with a materials science degree, working in a steel factory for a while then quit and started teaching himself coding online. 6 months later he has a job at SAP Ariba one of the top companies to work for in the US and they have craft beer fridays all day during work...
