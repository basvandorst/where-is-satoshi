That's what I was thinking.  The protocol isn't working on my phone tho. It's not coming through as a link. .
It worked before on my phone. Even in text messages. But now its not even working through email. 
I'm using MyCelium

Just tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it didn't fix it :(

But it used to be bitcoin:address  and it would show up as clickable on my android phone.  Now its not linking.

Ok so it IS bitcoin:addresshere BUT it's not showing up as a link on my phone ( I thought it did before? )
When I copy/paste "bitcoin:myaddress" into my browser on my phone it works and pops up MyCelium so why isn't it just showing up as clickable? Having to copy/paste is annoying..
Is it supposed to show up as a link? Maybe I'm just not remembering correctly?

Noob here. No clue what a node is so that's my excuse =/

Will do thanks for that :) USA here.  Feels good to finally be able to talk to other coiners lol.

Sorry it's a bit early here.  I meant BlockChain
I would like to just load my wallet onto a mobile app using the same wallet.

I'm still new myself and just now getting my first wallet via Android..  
You say bottom out...  Do you think the price will ever go back up?    I saw the Inside Man on CNN the other night.  He recorded his experience based on a year ago and BitCoins were worth over $600USD then!??  That's crazy lol    Now they seem to be in the $200s so  will they ever go up that high again?
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:28:26
It does.  I heard about it off and on over the past couple years.   I was like ehhh sounds silly.    
Saw it on CNN and was like hmm ok maybe I'll bite..
Here I am HOOKED!         I hope the whole world goes BitCoin.  It's  so fun to just send $$ and pay for things instantly via a mobile phone.  It's also fun to keep track of everything and be your own banker.    Gotta be secure tho =X

Please tell me YOU personally donated that money and they didn't just take it out of your account just cause.

BlockChain just makes it so difficult.  I don't like BlockChain so I want  ALL of my funds off of there down to the last penny.
BlockChain doesn't tell you what the miner fee is when figuring up the total.
For instance.  I have .10 cents or 0.00040579 BTC
I want to move the full amount (including the fee) to my mobile wallet.   Some apps/sites tell you right then and there what the fee will be if sending said ammount but not BlockChain  =/
