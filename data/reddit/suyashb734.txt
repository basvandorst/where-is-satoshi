Oh okay I understand but are you saying that there are many cases in which the merchant delivers the product/service and still they are charged?? What about taking such a case to the courts? 
Also there are many third-party systems with fiat, why not use other systems you may trust instead of paypal? Even if some third-party mediators come in bitcoin there would still be the same problem right?

Well I have already read a lot of stuff on it. Infact I know etherum, Swarm, Storj etc and some companies that are working on it. I just dont understand how it works technically, and I also wanted to know the various possibilities surrounding it.

Can you explain why you think they are better than Spotify?? I have used both services and I have to say I think spotify is much better

The thing about current irreversible systems is that nothing just happens magically!. You ask for a payment to be reversed (giving some valid reason) and then the third-party becomes the mediator.


This seems like a good idea and would increase a lot of consumer adoption

I could vouch for this. The exact same thing happened with me

I managed to get around 0.4 extra bitcoins (replicating the same process every day) even though I was Not KYC/AML verified 
@_date: 2014-07-07 10:31:27
yes, but people dont store all their cash into a single wallets or even multiple wallets right? So it seems to me that people might not want to hold so many bitcoins especially when the security is a major concern for a completely non-technical user?

Actually this was the problem I think because whenever I double clicked I got 2 transactions. But I think the problem has been resolved or for now they have been manually processing the transactions

you're just outdated..

Is mycelium safe from hackers etc? What about storing the private keys?
I want to know a method in which anyone who doesnt know any Technical stuff about bitcoin can use it very easily without worrying about security?

What if the seller doesnt deliver, No chargebacks possible.
And thats not even the point, why would I buy with Bitcoin? what incentive?
I agree with you - International Remittance might be killer
@_date: 2014-09-04 07:52:16
I agree, Infact I think the fees are very high especially for sending low amount of money. 1mBTC is usually the fees associated, which is around 40 cents currently. That is pretty high given that I can just send someone using internet banking without any fees

I still dont see much interest in an average customer regarding Bitcoin. And to be perfectly honest the price does matter because  why would anyone (someone who doesnt understand Bitcoin correctly) buy Bitcoins if the price is going down? 
The price fluctuation is too high for anyone to get in Bitcoin, Plus Security problems for someone who doesnt know how to secure their wallet?
And what incentive is there for an average customer to use Bitcoin??
I know these questions have probably been asked before but still I have not found any solution

I have heard about multi-sig escrow services but never used one. I have two questions
Is Multi-sig escrow used a lot?
In case of a third-party like paypal and bank since the currency comes under Government jurisdiction so in case of a fraud someone could file a case, but if there is a fraud concerning a third-party bitcoin service who would be responsible?
@_date: 2014-07-07 10:39:46
The only reason I would want reversible payment is if I want to buy something online and they fail to deliver. It would be good if I could get that money back otherwise it would probably be useless for online payments.

Thanks for the prompt reply! :)
I wanted to understand more technical details about a bitcoin wallet. There must be a string that specifies how many bitcoins i have. Also when I make a transaction some data travels from my address to another address so what is that data? How is it verified?
Also I use a multibit wallet. Do i have to make a backup of both the wallet file and private keys??
Many nodes take part in transaction verification. Now do all of these nodes have the same data? how is that maintained?
Addresses are generated randomly. I understand that the probability of Two clients generating the same address is very low but it is still possible that the same address gets generated again??? what happens in that case?
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:05:16
Thanks Again!! :)
How come the transaction is coming from 2 addresses? and received by 3? 
I do have some more questions and as I am new to bitcoin I probably would have a lot more in the future. Can I PM you for more questions??
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:35:41
I have yet to understand what a bitcoin is. I mean I know it is just a string of characters, but how are these characters built? and also it can be infinitely divisible so how does it work?? Where is the amount of bitcoins stored? and can that be tampered with?
Also if i have someone's wallet file can i spend it?? Where are the private keys stored? 
I have many more questions but seems like I have asked enough for now..
