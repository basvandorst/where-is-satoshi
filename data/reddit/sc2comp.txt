I pondered making a virus that would steal wallet.dat and then have the zombies mine constantly, but then I realized how annoying it would be to infect a significant number of people. If someone already has a botnet (most that do are script kiddies that can't program anyway), setting the botnet towards mining would be very profitable.

The articles on the site are usually pretty good, but this was godawful. Bitcoin's purpose isn't tax evasion.
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:37:58
No, but I read the thread and you still haven't provided a refutation, so I'm pretty much restating it here.
@_date: 2011-07-12 17:12:43
This isn't about whether *you* can do it, it's about whether it's viable. And it is. Your lottery system is pretty secure, but not **entirely** secure.

The passwords are irrelevant because they can just make a new account and pump it full of money thanks to the SQL injection.

100ghash is a high figure, 30+ ghash should be enough to solo mine.

Bitcoin *enables* tax evasion, but tax evasion is not its purpose.
This comic tries to act as if Bitcoin is a) a currency for anarchists, and b) using Bitcoin will magically free you from government.
@_date: 2011-06-14 23:55:22
I don't think it's suddenly going to reverse right now, as the trend has always been to spike down and then spike back up. I'm simply saying Bitcoins as an investment are risky if you're going to buy at high prices, because the media exposure is nearing its peak.

For everyone saying it's an XSS vulnerability, it's also a CSRF vulnerability (where you trick a browser into executing a command, usually without a user knowing).

I love the idea. Unfortunately, I don't have any BTC to donate, but here's to hoping others do :D

"A bittorrent for cash"
Are you serious?

This is also wrong. He was on the real website.
@_date: 2011-05-29 05:30:24
Explaining **how** bitcoin works isn't possible to someone who doesn't understand basic cryptography without using enough analogies to dilute their actual knowledge gained, thus it's best to just explain what Bitcoin is: an internet currency with no organization backing it.
@_date: 2011-06-12 06:36:43
Definitely a false hypothesis.
@_date: 2011-07-12 20:37:27
This is a pretty irrelevant place to say this, but I thought I'd mention that you consistently come across as sexist and ignorant. You keep accusing people of defending Jessy simply because she is female whereas **you** are the one making a big deal out of her gender and saying things like "dom is dom".
You seem to think that the only reason Jessy has gotten so much support is because she is female and not because she posted pages of extremely intelligent advice that was promptly ignored by dozens of users who branded her as a troll without even knowing what the word means.
@_date: 2011-05-17 23:15:23
The browser doesn't know it's insecure. The point of an XSS vulnerability is that it's reflected in the website, therefore the browser thinks it is just part of the web page (since it is).
EDIT: By 'autosubmit', it means that I could send you to myevilsite.com and it would automatically submit that form in an invisible iframe so that I would transfer funds without you knowing.
@_date: 2011-05-29 06:25:32
If they talk about it not being secure, all you can really say is that it's complex math. Then again, most people are distrustful of math and science so that might backfire.

Cheating? The point is to make the best logo for the bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2011-06-14 22:41:20
This kind of growth isn't sustainable without more non-speculatory use of BTC. BTC has been rising over time, but it's stupid to assume it will continue like this. I wouldn't buy at any price above 12 dollars.
@_date: 2011-07-13 02:33:19
Which requires actual work and an idea beyond paying with Bitcoin. You'll notice Jessy suggested an entirely different model.
@_date: 2011-05-19 02:06:29
Coins will only be mined out in 2140, and by then the network will be so large that transaction fees are a must.
@_date: 2011-07-05 05:17:14
I payed for the first ransom, but I have a feeling this model won't work. The ransoms are too tiny to be worth much anyway, and it looks like it's taken a lot of time to amass simple .1 BTC.
My suggestion is just to put advertisements on the site, or experiment with browser mining.
@_date: 2011-05-17 01:18:35
Completely wrong. I'm sure whoever explained it to you used prime numbers as an analogy.
@_date: 2011-06-14 06:14:17
Don't be naive enough to assume this is true. Rising prices purely because of speculation will always drop later. It's ridiculous to tell anyone not to buy low and sell high.
@_date: 2011-07-12 20:38:53
This idiot obviously doesn't realize that securing 10%, or even 1%, or even 0.01% of a multi billion dollar industry is a complex task that requires more than a shiny bitcoin logo or the experienced of loading up open source forum software and changing one image.
@_date: 2011-07-13 05:06:14
I remember seeing this essay on the TOR Hidden Wiki a year or two ago. Funny to see it again.
@_date: 2011-05-17 20:35:33
And the price buyers are willing to pay on major markets is close to $8.
@_date: 2011-05-17 04:55:08
These mining operations give security to the bitcoin system. They are absolutely important.

I'm also guilty of this :/

Madoff had plenty of time to get people to trust him. I'm not saying I don't trust you; I'm saying that your system isn't 100% secure as you advertise.

I wasn't saying paper money is secure; I was addressing his questions about his grandma being worried about security.

Because wikileaks is not dumb enough to make the password "password", or a word in the dictionary. If the password is anything less than a dozen letters long with characters, numbers and caps I'll be very surprised. The entire point of the insurance file is that the contents can only be revealed by wikileaks.
@_date: 2011-05-17 03:45:40
That will only happen if Bitcoin becomes the only currency, which is not going to happen. Bitcoin will remain a minority currency but a very strong minority if my guess proves correct. This makes it ideal for online transactions (no duh), and obviously allows some small tax evasion. That being said, it won't be a wide-scale thing.
@_date: 2011-05-17 20:34:15
It maintains the network by creating new blocks, while also preventing block tampering.

TOR is also used for valid deeds like accessing the internet in restricted places. With freedom always comes shady services, but don't pretend that because people use TOR for illegal activities they don't use it for legal one as well.

Someone already posted a vulnerability - you buy 99.9% of the tickets, are nearly guaranteed to anonymously win, and just leave if you lose your money.

Extremely interesting. I'm afraid that the company will suffer heavy losses without widespread adoption, however.

Yet another idiot that's letting wistful thinking get past reality. Bitcoins aren't magic; to start a business that accepts Bitcoins you have to START A BUSINESS, and that requires more than an idea.
Even more laughable was Vegetta's submission of tweet forums as proof of his web experience; as Jessy said he loaded up Simple Machine Forums and replaced one image.
@_date: 2011-05-21 04:01:20
Bitcoin doesn't use the bittorrent protocol. They are similar in that they are P2P, but the author's description of bitcoin was horrendous.

From many of your other posts I had thought that you were a pretty smart and intelligent individual. Instead, however, you ignored the one person who actually knew how to stop bitcams from being yet another startup fail.
Vegetta himself is not someone you want leading a project. He posts private messages, can't take criticism, as han overinflated ego, and somehow thinks that anyone who says why an idea will fail is actually trying to sabotage the project or desperately wants to join.
Using bitcoins for porn is a great idea, but not a unique one, and the site still has to actually be a porn site. Vegetta seems to think that offering bitcoins will make up for the shitty quality of production and management he's heading towards.
How Vegetta can simply reply "TLDR" to an incredibly long, detailed post on what is wrong with the project is completely frightening. He's been calling anyone trying to reveal how shitty of an idea he has a troll.
Why both you and Vegetta have been so rude and dismissive of someone with real experience in the industry is beyond me. The fact that you can't see past her employment as a sex worker when you're trying to create a porn site yourselves is ridiculous.

As someone that knows phantomcircuit, Britcoin is virtually guaranteed to be secure (assuming he wrote the code).

Except if you buy enough tickets you'll basically never HAVE to flee. I trust you, but that is a potential vulnerability. If you buy 999 tickets for every 1, you should be able to do it at least 400 times with an extremely high chance of not getting caught.
The best way to do it is to use an escrow service for ticket money.
@_date: 2011-06-05 05:43:05
I've considered this, but the problem is the lack of automated trading on BCM (it's there, but very low volume), and the difficulty of transferring money between accounts. You need a large amount of starting money to make any actual profit.
@_date: 2011-06-22 04:51:35
When one of my anonymous friends who is connected with these guys told me about the full SQL vuln, this is the conclusion that I immediately reached. I doubt it was even an account with a weak password; they probably just registered a new account themselves and modified its BTC value to 500k.
This is why a rollback would be necessary for MTGox.
