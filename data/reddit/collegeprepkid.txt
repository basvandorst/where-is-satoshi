Some software that looks like it has the potential to change the world is [ZeroNet]( It allows for entirely decentralized websites to be created by anyone easily, and I've seen people from Russia to China using it daily to spread information about what's going on in their country which they would never be allowed to share through other means due to their repressive governments.
It's mainly built by one guy, Tomas Kocsis. While not a registered non-profit, the [donation page]( has some important feature bounties that nobody has been able to afford since Bitcoin went up so high. The funds of which would be distributed to the community and whoever implemented the feature.
I host a public proxy into the network [here]( I believe it could be insanely important especially during these times when the FCC is trying to turn the Internet into one giant paywall.

Use [Tor]( with the [Meek pluggable transport](

I'm afraid not, but something I am very excited for is the new [Snowflake]( pluggable transport. It allows for random web users to act as temporary bridges to the Tor network, effectively making blocking on an IP bases next to impossible. I'm unsure whether this provides much past obfs4's level of deep packet inspection avoidance however.
Snowflake is available to test in [TBB's latest alpha release](

Serving their Android .apk over a non-HTTPS connection is a big no-no though.

That would happen with losing any phone with a contacts app, no?
