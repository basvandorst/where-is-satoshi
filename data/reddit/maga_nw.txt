I'm actually glad you made this comment. I've seen a lot of threads about coinbase recently, and I was curious what the community had to say. Unfortunately the discussion was shut down by the first comment, which is why I even responded. 
I don't even use coinbase, but it's good to hear about weird and fishy stuff happening, especially when it has to do with security. I'd rather read ten great discussions and realize it was a security issue with something minor, than to shut down any conversations about something that could reach much further than one service (or a handful of users). 
If coinbase is acting fishy themselves, I don't think people would necessarily want to trust the company as a whole, which is why someone would turn to Reddit, where consumers of the service can discuss a reoccurring issue. 
And yes, tech communities are incredibly elitist, and the first commenter only proved that point.   
What leads you to believe it's a smear campaign when it could just be a fraudulent business? I've been sending a few buddies over there who are just getting into this, and I'd hate to have sent them somewhere with poor security.

However you want to justify yourself man.

Windows TFM encryption? Maybe used hardware requirements as well as passphrase.

What does politics have to do with this? Can we get back to the original topic? Thanks.

You sound like you're trying to censor me just for the name of my Reddit account. That's rude as hell.

I was talking about you; and you are obviously not going to act civilly, so I'd appreciate it if you stopped now.  
Somehow you thought politics were appropriate to talk about when I didn't bring them up.
If I were to be having a discussion with a Muslim about poetry, would it be appropriate to slander Islam because the person is wearing Hijab, or should I save that for a discussion about Islam, and not poetry?
I get it, you need to make a Trump supporter feel insignificant. I just think you should take the conversation to a political subreddit and let the discussion about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency take place in this one. I'm more than happy to debate you in the appropriate setting.

Yeah. You tell 'em. That ad hominem will surely discredit anything he has to say!

... you're the one who kept injecting your politics which resulted in mods removing your vitriolic nonsense.

Why is this community so elitist? The guy is asking a question; at least contribute to the conversation.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:48:17
Holy shit dude you're a bigot. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:50:37
I wonder how useful you are in a diverse workplace.

There we go again.
