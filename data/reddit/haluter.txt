Can the Ledger Nano S handle multiple wallets at the same time, for example BTC and ETC?
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:22:28
I've been hodling BTC since 2013, and bought £100 of ETC a few weeks ago out of curiosity, and it's now worth £180. lol indeed.

Misconception? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:27
It's not always about a lack of belief in Bitcoin. If you are in your 20's or 30's it's fine to "hodl forever", but some of us are in our 50's and 60's, and that changes your perspective on what's important.

This is exactly what I'm after. I'm currently using a Raspberry Pi for my cold storage with an Electrum wallet. If I could do the same but on a re-purposed Android phone it would spare me the hassle of having to deal with a USB power supply, wireless keyboard + mouse, and an HDMI cable + TV/monitor for the Raspberry Pi. Will your app support HD wallets, so that I can restore from a seed if the phone is lost/breaks?

Can't wait for Electrum 2.0 that can use the Trezor to sign transactions. I think that is the perfect combination of ease of use and secure cold storage.
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:51:23


Your bitcoins should NOT be regarded as being in cold storage if you have indeed typed the seeds into Electrum on an online computer. As others have already advised you, I strongly suggest that you get a Trezor to secure your BTC.

About 30 years ago our family visited [Sun City]( I was mesmerized by all the lights and sounds of the machines. I walked to the nearest machine, put in some of my money, pulled the arm, and my money was gone. "Fuck this shit" I said to myself, as I walked outside into the lush gardens where I spend the rest of the weekend, never to gamble again.

My life would be complete if I could run Mycelium in cold storage mode on an old/cheap offline Android phone, and use it to sign bitcoin transactions created on my daily phone by scanning QR codes. I call this the poor man's Trezor.

Mycelium allows you to spend from cold storage, and automatically sends the change back to the cold storage address.

Well, on my computer mytrezor.com is as slow as molasses, and it bogs down the entire browser (Chrome and Firefox). It freezes for 5 seconds, then unfreezes for 2, and repeats this cycle as long as I have mytrezor.com open. It's hardly "ready to go" and I avoid it like the plague. As a partial solution to check my Trezor balance I've imported the Trezor's public keys into mycelium. This is on a brand new Win 8.1 gaming system. I have started to migrate to the Ledger Nano Wallet, which is fantastic, and works with GreenAddress on smartphones as well.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:47:21
Electrum on a Raspberry Pi that will never connect to the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:19:45
You don't need the wallet password. Just restore the wallet from your 12 word seed, that you wrote down on paper and stored safely.
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:35:21
Same here. It's ridiculous that one of the first things you probably have to do upon receiving your new Trezor is to throw away the supplied USB cable and replace it with a better quality cable. I've been struggling with Firefox hanging when connecting my Trezor for months. I just did a fresh install of Windows 8.1 and now I find that mytrezor is down. 
It's more work, but I'm going back to my RaspPi + Electrum cold storage method I successfully used before I got the Trezor.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:29:30
This is why people have been saying again and again that you should store the majority of your bitcoin in cold storage, and just enough in your hot wallet for your day-to-day needs. There is nothing wrong with Electrum if you use it correctly. I have 99% of my bitcoin private keys on a Raspberry Pi in an Electrum wallet that will NEVER touch the interwebs. Any computer that is connected to the internet should be regarded as compromised, period.
@_date: 2014-05-24 11:06:35

Thanks, but this is not what I'm trying to achieve. I'm looking for a cold-storage solution using Android, with the ability to sign bitcoin transactions created on a different computer. As far as I know Mycelium does not do this.

This method of getting unpopular regulations passed is as old as the hills. It works like this: You initially propose such a draconian set of regulations that people lose their shit. You then wait a bit, allow people to comment on it, and then you propose a more conservative set of regulations that the people are much more willing to accept. Of course, your second proposal is actually what you wanted to accomplish all along.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:01:15
Satoshilabs offered a "Raspberry Pi shield for developers" kit for at least a year before the final Trezor was released, so that is no excuse.

Problem solved! I'm sure OP will be delighted.
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:23:45
Not really, the problem I'm trying to solve is having a cheap, portable, offline cold-storage device that does not require an additional computer or screen to use, and that can sign transactions. A USB stick or DVD still requires a computer.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:54:03
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:06:26
That looks very good on OSX. However, as a Trezor owner that suffered through much issues with the Windows driver for the Trezor, poor quality USB cables, and the problematic Trezor website, how well does this work on Windows? Is it as smooth as in the demo?
*edit: I am now trying to buy the Ledger Wallet from my Trezor account, and the My Trezor site is stuck on trying to get my account balances. The 30 minute buy window is down to 20 minutes. I really need something better than Trezor, Ledger Wallet looks like it may do the job.*

I followed [this]( guide by another redditor. The setup process looks complicated, but once you've set it up, all you need to do to spend your bitcoin is to create the transaction on your main pc, and sign it from the Raspberry Pi, after which you broadcast the transaction from your main pc. Takes about 5 minutes.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:33:40
Maybe, but you can't sign transactions on it, which is the main requirement for my needs.

@_date: 2014-11-16 14:38:28
Not if he uses an HD wallet like Electrum and writes down or memorizes the seed. As long as you have the seed you can fully restore your wallet on any computer, even if the original computer you created the wallet on was stolen or destroyed in a fire or flood.
@_date: 2014-09-30 10:46:51
Any multisig wallet should be OK, for example BitGo.

Especially when paired with the Trezor. You have the convenience of a mobile hot wallet and the security of cold storage on a smartphone.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:28:59

I'm pretty sure DVDs degrade much faster than flash memory. Laminate the paper backup of your wallet's seed and put that in a safe. Recovering from hardware failure is as simple as replacing the device and using the seed to restore your wallet.

[Entropy]( is a chip on a USB stick that prints paper ~~wallets~~ ECDSA keys, when you stick it in a printer that supports printing from a USB port. It is made by the same guys that developed [Mycelium]( for Android devices. They are busy preparing the first 1000 Entropy devices for shipment.

I use Mycelium + Trezor for both a hot wallet and cold storage all in one. Hot wallet only contains £50 or less, no Trezor required, but to move cold storage funds the Trezor is required. An additional benefit of Mycelium cold storage is that you can keep an eye on your funds.

I own 2 Trezors, but I would currently recommend the Ledger Nano S which can be setup and restored using only a USB power bank. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:35:38
The Trezor firmware code is open source and can be downloaded from Github &amp; reviewed by anyone. It is nearly impossible for anyone or app to extract the private keys from the Trezor by bypassing the PIN\passphrase. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:22:39
Because the private keys never leave the Trezor. Mycelium is only allowed to import the xpub keys from the Trezor, so any time you want to spend your money you have to sign it by connecting the Trezor to your phone and confirming the transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-13 13:40:01


I do just that (watch balance + get receiving address) with Mycelium on Android and Electrum on Windows. No need to connect the Nano S to see the balance.
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:46:50
Mycelium + Trezor or Ledger Nano S allows you to use both hot wallets for small amounts, and secure cold storage wallets.

The Trezor + Mycelium is very suited to easy &amp; secure spending on the go. I have both a cold storage wallet on Mycelium that I need the Trezor for to move funds to a hot wallet, also on Mycelium, which doesn't require the Trezor. I keep only enough on the hot wallet for daily use. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 23:20:50
No need to worry about your Trezor getting damaged\lost, since you also need to keep a secure copy of your Trezor recovery seed, the same as with Electrum. If your Trezor is lost\damaged, you can use a replacement Trezor to access your money, or with any of these apps:
* Electrum (Linux, Windows, OSX, Android)
* Mycelium (Android)
* Wallet32 (Android)
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:04:56
I prefer the Trezor over a Ledger (I have both) because it has a built-in screen, and doesn't require Chrome. Trezor works great with Electrum (Windows, Linux, OSX), as well as Mycelium (Android).
In fact, I use Trezor + Mycelium on my phone for both a hot wallet (quick payments &lt; £50, doesn't require Trezor), and cold storage (requires Trezor to move money).

~~Perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my original post; I know I don't need the wallet password on the RasPi, just the seed, what I meant to say was that I wanted to use the wallet password to encrypt the text file using GPG and a symmetric cipher (not public key). In this way I don't need to remember two passwords or secure a private key, although I accept that the password entropy isn't as high as the seed as pointed out by Although, thinking about it, since the private key is also protected using a password it's the same risk.~~
  
I see what you mean now, good point.

The wallet &amp; encryption key has been etched into my memory for the past 30 years, and I'm not concerned about forgetting it.

Speedy is awesome. I've set them up as a payee at my bank, and buying bitcoins is as easy as sending money to Speedy using my bank's mobile app. It usually takes less than 10 minutes for the bitcoins to be transferred.

1 Trezor with 10BTC and the recovery seed stored in a few safe places is easier to manage and just as secure as 10 Trezors with 1BTC each and 10 recovery seeds you have to store. In addition, by using 1 Trezor with 10 different passwords you can achieve the same effect as having 10 Trezors.

I really felt sympathy for the committee members, as you can see they are struggling to understand the concept of Bitcoin, and how something that a) you can't hold in your hand, and b) hasn't been issued by the state, can have intrinsic value. It's going to be a tough sell until the younger generation starts taking over those positions.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:52:59
Looks fantastic, but as a Trezor user I have a few questions:
  
1. Does it support the import of Trezor wallets that uses a password?
2. Any plans on supporting browsers other than Chrome?
3. Does it work with Mycelium on Android?
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:40:28
Well, since you literately wrote the book on Bitcoin I will take your advice to heart. :) 
I'm a firm believer in the KISS principle in software design, perhaps it's time to apply it to Bitcoin as well.

It's been a while since I looked at OpenBazaar, think I'll check it out again.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:37:03
On Windows I only used the official 1.9.8 package.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:38:39
That is actually incorrect. The Trezor allows you to add an optional password to the seed during wallet creation (basically acts like an extra seed word). If you access the HD wallet on the Trezor without the password (if it was used), you will only find an empty or decoy wallet. Trezor refers to this as a [hidden wallet](

Sounds promising! Looks like I'll be buying one to add to my growing collection of hardware wallets.

I requested a raise limit a year ago and no reaction. Sent an email to their support earlier today and got a reply along the lines of "our clever software decides when you get a raised limit nothing we can do k bai". Guess I'll just use Bittylicious then.
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:02:33
Agreed, but on the Trezor it's an extra layer of security, gives you plausible deniability, &amp; gives you access to unlimited HD wallets using the same seed.
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:50:48
It would be useless without knowing the wallet password. In fact, I keep a few satoshis in the normal HD wallet as a decoy.

How did you ask? My account is 2 years old and I can only buy 0.4BTC
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:14:51
I must be getting old. Did you just thank someone for insulting your website?
@_date: 2016-07-03 12:57:41
I am aware of this thanks, that's why I haven't been too concerned with carrying a plain text card with my seed words in my wallet so far.

A massive solar flair would be awesome, a massive solar *flare* on the other hand, would be bad.

I was being /s - sorry thought it was obvious.

No. Get a Trezor.

Is there a £ version in a dark theme?

I've been hodling since 2013, purely because I can't be bothered with the effort required to sell them during the frequent crashes. It's an approach that has served me well so far.

Unfortunately safe-deposit boxes isn't a thing in the UK as far as I am aware. It may be available in London but certainly not in rural areas. How safe would a sentence from my favourite book be for the encryption password?

Excellent. I contributed to Dark Wallet, but this is looking very good.

I think I have reached my brain's limit in absorbing new information. "x bitcoin days destroyed" just does not make any sense. I now understand how my dad feels when he sits in front of his laptop. :(

Has BIP0038 been finalized? I fear storing my money in BIP0038 paper wallets, and in 10 or 20 years, when I or my descendants try to decrypt them, I find that BIP0038 was changed at some point and the current software does not decrypt my old private keys.

I like it, I'm just having trouble finding the dark theme. My eyes won't stand more than 10 minutes of staring at that site as is.

If only it was available for Firefox. Guess I'll wait for Dark Wallet.

There are none in my area as well, and I live 6 miles from Brentwood, the home of TOWIE. I'm so close to London I can actually see the city's lights in the clouds when it is overcast.
