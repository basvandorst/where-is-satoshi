A futures contract gives the buyer the obligation to purchase a specific asset, and the seller to sell and deliver that asset at a specific future date, unless the holder's position is closed prior to expiration.

Here we come back to life, we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna see it
Oh all you need to know is that we're holding on
Even if we fall we will rise up
And we follow the path that we believe in
No we're not gonna stop until we reach it
Oh all you need to know is that we're holding on
We rise up from the dust and claim our throne

@_date: 2018-06-12 16:01:32
Is he going to "eat his own dick" literally as in consuming it like a food, or is it more like sucking one's own dick autofellatio style?

Divisible is not equal to printing more supply. If you own say 10% of total supply say 2.1 million units , when the units are split into 10 , you now own 21 million which is still 10% of total supply ( new total of 210 millions) . Where as in printing ,  if you own 2.1 million in the beginning, when people print more supply u still own 2.1 million after printing which your possession is diluted to 1% in the new total supply . Do you see the difference
