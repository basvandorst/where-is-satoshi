Isn't Buttercoin funded by Google Ventures?

Don't know how I feel about this.. What if the price goes back to 45?

Most definitely Ming.  That "明" at the top of the note means Ming.

1. There is no such thing as "the **interstate** commerce **act**"; the Commerce **Clause** is a clause under the U.S. constitution.
2. Mr. Sean King has torn the bitlicense proposal apart on this very ground in his [comments](

Is this correct?  I believe the note shown in the picture (issued in Ming Dynasty) is technically not fiat money, and certainly not the **only** legal tender at the time.
* Clearer image of the note is available [here](
* These notes are technically redeemable for one block (贯) of coins made of a copper/tin alloy (like bronze).  Those coins are illustrated at the top of the note. That makes them commodity money, not fiat.
* Bronze coins, silver, [gold]( and these notes are all legal tender at the time.  For example, the text in the lower portion of the note states that "this note is exchangable into one block of bronze coins."
* The note also states that: "whoever counterfeits such notes will be beheaded."

Which bank/payment processors are they using to enable USD deposit?

**Pure authentication applications do not require a blockchain**
Agreed.  For example, banking professionals have been using X.509 certificate for logins to the Federal Reserve E-Apps system for years.

Coinsetter CEO also mentioned that certain aspects of the BitLicense Proposal are technically impossible to comply.  Anyone knows which provisions these CEOs are talking about?  I vaguely recalled it has something to do with knowing the physical addresses of counterparties.

What worries me is not the crash.  It is the steady down trend during the past few months when lots of good news happened.

Milly, bitcoin's usefulness for financial purposes does not in and of itself make it "financial product" for purposes of technical interpretation of the Financial Services Law.  For example, foreign exchanges in and of themselves do not count as "financial products" under the Financial Services Law, nor does gold.  Judging from legislative history, **"financial products" refer to derivatives that build on top of these assets.**

How does one prove that the private key for a send-to-burn address is truly lost?  Or  are there addresses that are cryptographically proven to be one way streets?

It's just at the Federal Reserve, "in the system" and "out of the system" are phrases people use all the time.  It fits into OP's post seamlessly.
I think OP works for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  The only major branch for that Federal Reserve Bank is the Miami branch.  Last time I checked, the Miami branch has no economist.  So I really don't know where OP works...

I believe OP has at least worked at the Federal Reserve.  
What convinced me is the use of the phrase "outside of the **system**," which refers to the Federal Reserve **System**.  Rarely do people use that reference outside of the Federal Reserve.
The post itself also exhibits disciplined deductive reasoning, consistent with OP's claimed role.
