Jesus Christ. Past performance does not predict the future. Markets are irrational, don't assume that it will hit that. You need to understand the technology, who the players are, what their incentives are, and what they're releasing soon. Those factors drive price and to be honest I'm willing to bet most people on here (including me) do not know a lot of the details. I believe in cdyptocurrencies but I sold when people started buying bitcoin on credit and mortgages and posts about grandma's wanting to get in the market started showing up. Those are all hallmarks of inexperience and ignorance in the market and look what that got us. Sure we're up since last year but 20k was shown to be not reasonable until more tech gets built on bitcoin. SegWit alone cannot scale to the transactions we want for global currency. Lightning is starting to show up in tiny pockets but it is still experimental and not necessarily ready for full go.
Thinking 40k to 1mil is a real possibility is a pipe dream. Sure it could happen but it won't be a real value based on the underlying tech.

If I'm remembering correctly all of Zero Hedge's articles are written under the pseudonym of "Tyler Durden". Just a thing they do.

Not everyone is going to want to store their life savings under a mattress at home. At the very least a bank will move to providing vault space. Its not going to "kill banks".
No need to belittle someone when they ask a question. How about you guide them to resources if you think they don't know enough. This low effort comment helps no one.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:01:04
But you need to store your bitcoin in a hardware or paper wallet when you put an amount like "life savings" in bitcoin. Now its physical safety is your problem. Where do you hide it? Under a mattress or in a safe deposit box? For physical security of your bitcoin people will likely still use banks, but for a slightly different purpose.

That's fucking stupid. Its putting rules that apply to dollars on a system that is so much different. They are trying to impose centralized rules on a worldwide decentralized system. They're trying to do the only thing they understand rather than learning a new trick.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:43:08
No, without centralized mining the difficulty decreases and it becomes possible to mine on personal computers again. At that point there is more hardware available to more secretly mine. Are they going to ban computers then? They'll build a miner that runs on a phone. They're going to ban phones? Lol. Etc.

Thank you. I don't need all the fancy stuff. Just sell and buy with fees lower than Coinbase. Does Gemini use SegWit? I would like the implementation I support to be friendly to the future of Bitcoin if I have the option. I was just going to put up with GDAX because it seemed like I had to.

If you are technically minded at all, the white paper from Satoshi is a great read. If not, there are a couple videos that I like to send people to help explain blockchains and how they secure things. I'll edit this post with those when I get home from work, hard to do it all on mobile.
Edit: 
This one does a pretty good job of describing Bitcoin as a money and what money is (a ledger of debt) in a short amount of time.
If you have 30min Andreas does a lot of intro videos. I watched different ones when I got interested years ago, but this more recent one is just as engaging at describing the very fundamental workings of bitcoin.
This one is a general description of what a block chain is. It gives a good walk through on how bitcoin actually works on a technical level in a fairly easy to understand way.
Those should get you started. They cover a nice on-ramp, a bit more depth, and then the technical description. Its a bit harder to find good videos now days because so many are "how to make money fast with bitcoin" instead of the really great technical descriptions, but Andreas has a lot of good videos that may get your YouTube recommendations to get you good ones.

Too bad I live in Minnesota so I can't use GDAX. Its Coinbase fees or nothing, I ain't got time to meet up for localbitcoins

I think you meant frugal life. Frivolous is not having purpose or value, useless extra.

Nope, he meant the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

What's wrong with a wage going down if the value the person is being paid is still going up due to the currency being more valuable? It's all relative, there is no inherent reason for it being bad other than the coloring your modern lenses give the situation.
If wages don't go down then people are constantly becoming more wealthy. Sure it isn't great for corporations, I'll give you that, but it is certainly good for people.
What about savings accounts? Deflation encourages savings because your money will be worth more in the future. If banks are no longer allowed to fractionally reserve they will actually need to raise interest rates to encourage people to save with them. This again is good for the people.
The US already imports practically everything anyways so this only helps increase our purchasing power. The service industries can't be farmed out so it's not like those will crash. People will still use them but pay less, which won't be a problem because those companies will be able run on "less" money.
I'd honestly like a response that speaks as to why the current policies are inherently good. You can claim that the economy has been stable, but is that a causation of slight inflation, or a correlation with the items we have valued as a society as well as having the benefit of low cost labor in developing countries? There is a lot of moving parts to explain the stability of the American economy with, a simple argument of saying slight inflation causes it is the most ridiculous statement to make without any evidence to tie them together.

Yeah the wisdom of "the only time you should lend to friends/family is when you're okay with treating it as a gift" from is very real here. You have to be prepared to lose money or lose friends in this scenario. "Social lending" sounds no different than just paying a friend the money and hoping you get it back, so why is this app needed? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:33:29
What is different between this and just sending bitcoin to a friend? The only difference I can find is that it calculates interest for you... I assume there isn't a legally binding "payback clause" for Credible Friends so its not like there is any recourse to get money from a friend (just like if you just handed them the bitcoin) in court. There's no innovation here, its just a different interface for a process that already exists.
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:47:49
But you can already send btc to another person...that's what I mean, sending btc is not new. If Credible Friends introduced a mechanism with which to make the loans legally binding so you could take a person to court for their unpaid debt then it would be something novel. The bank can do this, if you can't do that on Credible Friends then CF is no different than just sending btc to friend when they need money. The only obligation to pay someone back in CF is social capital/relations. That means all CF does is provide just another interface to send btc to a friend there is nothing else enforcing the deals just like emailing a QR code.

The problem with this statement is that OP had a goal. They didn't NEED to time the market, only wait for something to happen (reach 1100). The OP needs to make their sell decision based on "can I afford losing all this money". Apparently, getting rid of loans isn't as important hodling or the sell should have gone through regardless of if the price still had gone up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:59:08
I think you might need to get outside more. Step away from checking your Bitcoin and go see a few comedy shows lol.

Even though I get what this is saying generally, I can't help but read this as a post from @_date: 2018-11-27 12:25:27
Yes, but the attack method could apply to any wallet using specific node.js libraries. I'm not familiar with what apps that means, but it's wider than a single app.

Thank you for this. I roughly understand the situation, but nothing as clear as this. It has made it very hard for me to parse all these comments of people hating on each other because I can't figure out where anyone is coming from. I recently bought a Trezor to store my coins but only did so to weather all this BS. I had my coins with Coinbase before and didn't want to be stuck to a single chain. I don't really care what chain wins out, what I care about is that the idea of cryptocurrency lives to see the future. I want the tech to survive, I could care less if it has the name Bitcoin or not. Hopefully this all blows over and we can keep on moving.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:52:22
Where should I go with my bitcoin if Coinbase is like this? I wasn't aware Coinbase was supporting this. I started with Coinbase due to the easy on-ramp, but I'm not aware of other options to easily purchase bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:52:45
Yup. I had lost access to my account due to a phone change and forgetting about authy. I got access to it again after hearing about Bitcoin being 4k and realized that I still had some left. That was a pleasant surprise. I purchased a Trezor now that its value is so much higher.
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:41:31
I don't think $10 bitcoin would be a bad thing. It would become a lot more accessible to someone if you can tell them they can buy a bitcoin for much less.
I too have been semi-burned (bought my first at around $500/btc) but I've been buying coins on the way down. I think the technology behind the currency is too important for it to completely fail, and since there is a rarity to the currency, eventually it will recover.
All the people selling out now, or losing their businesses because they defrauded people, are those that really aren't in it for the tech. The drop in the price of bitcoin is culling those who took advantage of a quick buck and the community is better for it. Honestly the shot to $1000 gave bitcoin a lot of press, and probably brought it to the attention of a lot of potential developers that are now improving it. Without that spike, who knows if the adoption of bitcoin would have continued, or be where it is now.

In 2010 I tried setting up a miner and could never get it to work (in highschool, didn't know a lot about computers/networking at the time). I quickly forgot about it until I heard about the peak. Damn I was so mad.
@_date: 2015-09-22 11:47:03
I'd agree except for the fact that there are plenty of examples where it is obvious the bank knows its laundering money for criminals or terrorists. Example: HSBC and Al Qaeda.
Edit: What I mean by this is that banks, currently, have no qualms with knowing supporting/doing illegal things so why worry about sketchy bitcoin companies?

I think I'm going to try to get the white paper from the blockchain. That sounds like it'll be a good exercise in understanding how information can be stored/retrieved on the chain, and also let me read the white paper since I have yet to do so.
So much to read, so little time.
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:13:36
I assume that the people on this subreddit know the potential that the blockchain and bitcoin have, that's why they stick with it even though its a nascent technology. I was curious what that moment of "hey this is revolutionary and could totally work" was for the people here. For me I count as a new user, but I'm sure there are people here that got in to it when it was very obscure and I wanted to hear those stories.
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:19:21
Correct me if I'm wrong:
The rise in the '30's was due to the confiscation of gold during the war? I feel like I read that somewhere, but I assume that someone on this subreddit can confirm or correct me.

If I recall correctly there was a statement made by his office afterwards that said other republicans were putting forth an amendment to raise spending that much: sans budget cuts for fiscal responsibility. What he wanted to show is that other Republicans are not actually fiscally conservative (they all voted for the budget increase without reductions) and that they only talk the talk. He was providing them a chance to walk the walk and they refused.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:22:21
Yeah I don't know what these people are reading. I barely did any searching on Google and every article that comes up is "your coins might not exist after the first".  Mainstream money came into bitcoin and now those mainstream people are taking their money out due to mainstream reasons. The average Joe has no idea the extent of black markets and bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:30:57
It matters for public perception. It doesn't matter for the inherent technology. Government acceptance is a marketing move for bitcoin, not an engineering one.
@_date: 2016-07-20 00:12:16
Then I guess you'll be waiting for 30 years before anyone uses bitcoin in any significantly large manner because the older generation of today will have to die off in your world. Older people might not understand bitcoin, but if they are going to use it they need reassurance and they aren't going to get that from an explanation of crypto. The "trust" of a government gives validation outside of the inherent protections of crypto and would warm those people up to the concept of using bitcoin.
