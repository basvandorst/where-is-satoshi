Given all the people suggesting lawsuits I think we're now post-irony.

"Supports freedom and democracy" is generally code for "is friendly to Western interests," FYI.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:52:22
Well I mean what do you expect.
@_date: 2014-10-03 04:15:06
Yeah, Bitcoin, where you have zero recourse when someone hacks you and spends your money, is definitely more reliable.

Ukraine could use some stability.  What could be better than Bitcoin?

What do you think a "college fund" is exactly

Damn.  I can't believe how much you just owned Barclays.

lol, the old "take an obviously unrelated dictionary definition to prove your point" tactic.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:25:15
Think a little harder about that one.

So why did they roll it back this year?  Why not leave it if the plan is for the NWO to do this to every country permanently?
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:49:08
Intuitively it seems obvious.  The guy who purchased the first pizza or whatever with BTC could have (well, in theory, if not in practice) bought like a house with the same money today.  In such an environment borrowing money to invest it in building a business and employing people would be a fool's errand.
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:20:22
No, that's only true if their net worth is positive, and deflation discourages investment.
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:59:10
lol.  Yes, I was there for a year and I speak Japanese.  
Actually, marriage and childbirth in Japan are way down because nobody can support a family due to the dismal state of the economy.  Deflation is especially bad for Japan because it's a net exporter and deflation makes it harder for foreign customers to buy their goods.  For this reason, the government has recently endeavored quite actively to make the yen fall in price in relation to the dollar.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:05:42
Well, here are a few reasons:
* More Americans have a negative net worth than have positive
* The home/construction and auto industries have customers who almost all use loans to buy their products
* Businesses almost always need to loan money to get big projects off the ground

Deflation is actually a disaster for a real currency people are using, although, sure, it would be nice for the handful of people who hold a lot of the currency.

The Great Depression involved a deflationary spiral
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:03:51
Hm, how could the knowledge that in five years something around a few bucks might be worth millions of dollars affect your inclination to spend or invest money?  Hard to say.
Really, if you want an example, look at Bitcoin.  What service people have set up to buy things with it has seen significant use by BTC advocates besides the various "black market" sites?
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:51:18
Just read any introductory economics material's discussion on deflation.  It's a really simple concept.  If you can achieve a higher rate of return with much lower risk by sitting on money instead of investing it (let alone borrowing and investing borrowed money), why would you employ anyone?
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:24:07
After Bitcoin's "infancy" ends there can be no more coins created but coins can be destroyed through loss.  It seems obvious that if it were really used as a currency there would be strong deflationary pressure on it.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:17:06
"Reality" being, apparently, whatever you would most like to believe as it's agreeable to your world view.  The best example you can come up with is Japan, which is in a really sad state (which is why there have been so many prime ministers whose term ended with their resignation).
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:18:07
Why would that be the case?  People are going to suffer hard disk failures or lose their equipment or just die without transferring their Bitcoin anywhere regardless of capitalization.
@_date: 2015-04-05 14:36:16
OK, to spell this out really carefully, there is a strong disincentive to loan money to buy things or invest in a business when there is deflation.  That leads to reduction in demand and then reduction in employment.  
@_date: 2015-04-05 16:54:09
So then Bitcoin is not a currency at all because you won't buy anything with it.  OK.
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:52:10
Also in the longer term anyone who can add two numbers together won't buy a house and then whoops that industry collapses and a bunch of people lose their jobs.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:23:09
Also why would you want to hear from a PR firm about a free press?  That's not exactly in the interests of PR folks.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:31:31
Gotta go back when they start accepting Bitcoin
