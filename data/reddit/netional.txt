This is not the reason. The reason is that miners can create transactions for free and spam the network with large blocks and UTXO sets.

I very much want Bitcoin to succeed, but I agree with you and OP that this wasting of energy just doesn't feel right.  I compare it with the problem of micro transactions which until recently was impossible to do with Bitcoin: you had to use some centralized party.  But then came the lightning network which solved this problem without compromising on anything.
I think the same should happen with the proof of work situation: there has to be a better solution (without compromising on anything).  I know that Ethereum is planning to switch to something like proof of stake in the future, and have done extensive investigation.  But they're not sure at this point so they opted to go with proof of work for the time being.  It just goes to show there are all sorts of hidden attack vectors with proof of stake.  Perhaps that the coins you mentioned are too small to be worthy of a sophisticated attack?
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:42:50
I like the idea. If you want influence in the future of Bitcoin, you must invest in mining. This would strengthen the network as well. Mining would be incentived on multiple levels :
* to make money 
* to prevent centralization, stable Bitcoin would mean stable foundation for your company (whether it is an exchange or wallet etc) 
* to influence the future of Bitcoin 
Perhaps economies of scale will favor centralized mining farms. But then there are always possibilities to participate in cloud hashing for a certain percentage, making a deal that 'your'  blocks are signed according to your preferences. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:05:25
If you are mining the block yourself, you are the one that determines which transactions are included. If you wish, you are allowed to include transactions without transaction fee. In this case, the dust probably originates from the miner themself. This is one of the flaws in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:13:30
Nobody cares? If you would havea  website in Russia, would you accept Bitcoin in public if it were banned? I guess not, rendering Bitcoin a lot less useful. Governments can not kill Bitcoin, but they can prevent mainstream adoption. If you are in it for the price of Bitcoin, lack of mainstream adoption is very bad news.

This suggestion of Gavin Andresen sounds to me the correct way to implement this. OP's problem would have a solution without weakening the 0-confirmation economy.

This sounds like a very good initiative.  However, to reduce distrust it would be helpful if the people behind this organization would be mentioned on the web site, including photographs.  It is now a bit too faceless, and although probably unfounded, some people might suspect this is some kind of trojan horse of the financial sector.

I can confirm p2pool is causing problems in combination with BFL ASIC's.  When I connect to a non-p2pool centralized pool I receive regular payouts (in the thousands of BTC, I have a 25 GH/s miner).  However when I connect to a p2pool node I receive no payouts whatsoever (tried for 7 days).  My system is working properly because I can see my BTC address mentioned at for instance  .  However, it consistency mentions 'no shares yet'.
The explanation is to be found everywhere on the Internet: for instance 
I subsequently tried to install my own p2pool node using the instructions at 
Herebey a subset of the instructions for Windows:
* Install Python 2.7: 
* Install Twisted: 
* Install Zope.Interface: 
* Install python win32 api: 
* Install python win32 api wmi wrapper: 
* Unzip the files into C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages
Does anyone call this easy?  I do not.  Especially not when receiving errors somewhere halfway during the installation steps.
So to conclude: I'm all for p2pool but a lot of work needs to be done with respect to ease of installation and support for hardware.  There's probably a reason why it's only a small pool...

This story has been beaten to death already, but nevertheless for me some kind of wakeup call.

It was a great reply indeed, but in my view forgot to mention that if you change the PoW algorithm, the amount of Bitcoin hashing power will not be a problem for your coin. I think we will see one winner for each PoW algorithm. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:11:42
More blocks would mean more consistent payouts for miners (higher chance of a payout on a given day, though on average of course it stays the same) . This would allow for smaller mining pools: as long as miners will receive a payout every day, they might not feel the need to join the biggest mining pools. And smaller and more mining pools is I think beneficial for decentralization. 
I do understand this a complex subject, and my argument possibly countered by more selfish mining strategies. 
I do hope you will ever find a way to incentive miners to run a full node : perhaps like ethereum which hashing algorithm requires the entire blockchain.

Here a practical example: you want to buy an ebook and have the option to leave your credit card details (provided you even have one, which I don't), or pay with Bitcoin without any risk of theft (you also save the credit card costs). 
Second example: you want to sell an ebook. You either accept Bitcoin for free without any partnership (Bitpay is not required) or you have to enter a contract with a payment provider. 
In short: Bitcoin enables an economic global village.

Or a cloud hashing operator. However, I checked the links in this thread and the transaction fees are being paid, so this is a different scenario. Nevertheless, it's still a flaw in Bitcoin, because every miner has the potential to flood the network with dust transactions. If he sends the dust to his own addresses, it doesn't even cost him that much, as long as the transaction cap per block has not been reached. There is one caveat that counters this flaw : the block will propagate slower, decreasing the chance of it being accepted. So perhaps not a fatal flaw. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:24:25
When reading the first comments I expected to see something ridiculous.  What I saw instead were very reasonable people giving a legitimate, simplified account of bitcoin and it's dangers.  Most people would like to have a simple explanation about things they don't know anything about. I dare say this includes most Bitcoin-ers when it's not 'our' subject: when you watch the news, do you want to hear about the technicalities of lawmaking?

It will have a negative effect. From my personal experience I have noticed negative attitudes towards Bitcoin, because people feel that they have missed the boat. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:09:05
A lot of points Mike makes are based on hoping that miners will run full nodes.  GHash has shown that that's probably too much to ask of the average miner.  Running a full node should be required when mining. Vitalik Buterin shows how this can be achieved:  (about 40% of of the article you will find an example). This solution does not invalidate ASIC's.
@_date: 2014-09-13 11:26:59
I hope every significant bitcoin company will start to control some hashing power, maybe just as a money neutral investment, for the purpose of stabilizing bitcoin.  If their prime objective is stability, they will always move to a smaller pool once a certain pool becomes too large.

Good point, but it does require more infrastructure. A bank account from the buyers perspective, a PayPal integration from the sellers perspective. With Bitcoin you can even put a qr code in a PowerPoint presentation and upload it to YouTube, and people are still able to reward you for the work.

This integration with YouTube could become huge! It will introduce a lot of people to Bitcoin and ChangeTip, both those that receive Bitcoin for the first time, as well as those reading the comments. 
I hope you will make it easy for any site to accept tips. This is in my view the missing link for the entire internet : finally content creators can monetize their content, without the ads. 
I have no problem with the 1% withdrawal fee. I do hope that there will also be an option to use ChangeTip on YouTube without exposure to the Google profile, perhaps in exchange for a slightly higher withdrawal fee. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:22:21


In my view this is a problem, not a feature.  Miners already spend a lot on mining equipment &amp; energy.  Requiring to run a full node will only add a small amount of extra cost in the form of extra bandwidth and extra storage.  And after all, since miners are the ones making money, shouldn't these also be the ones supporting the network.


The proof of work algorithm will require random calculations across the entire block chain.  As far as I understand it, you cannot get away with any summary of the blockchain: your need every transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:48:14
But that might be because sidechains are technically problematic: all the implications were perhaps not entirely clear when the project started.  With the lightning network however the inventors have clearly demonstrated feasibility.  There are already similar implementations (partially) implemented, but as far as I can see these still require a certain amount of trust.  For instance  and  And this limitation has been solved with the lightning network proposal.
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:02:50
Looks nice. If existing companies start offering Bitcoin related services, it will give it a stamp of approval. Like all networkers know : the cold contact is the most difficult one. If you are referenced by someone they know, you're much more likely to be accepted. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:37:56
Ethereum solves this to ssome extent by making PoW algorithm ASIC resistant and requiring a full node. This way every miner must run a full node (even if part of a mining pool)and every full node might as well turn on mining, since it doesn't require specialised hardware. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:36:14

ChangeTip-like Off-chain transactions do, lightning network Off-chain transactions are just as trustless and decentralized as a normal on-chain transaction.

lightning.network is necessary for micropayments like 1 Satoshi. The transaction fees on the blockchain will always be too high.

The bank transfers will probably require no transaction fee, so it will be better than Bitcoin from that perspective.  (I'm a Bitcoin proponent by the way)

I think it is just early days and an announcement will come later.  I was looking at  (from the author of a good analysis of the lightning network:  and saw it had moved.  I read recently that this author Rusty Russell has started working on it and apparently he has now joined blockstream.
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:41:57
With the current block time of 10 minutes you would need a mining pool with a market share of 16% if you want to have a payout every hour.
With a block time of 1 minute the mining pool only needs to have a market share of 1.6%
Maybe a payout every hour is not necessary to attract miners.  But if you're looking for reasons to lower the block time, this is one of them.

This person is not lying, you interpret his body language wrong. He has the body language of the person who is tired of explaining things to people who do not really understand the situation: he has been performing an heroic effort by paying back out of his own pockets 3000 Bitcoin (how many of you would do this?), but very disillusioned to realize the circumstances are such that the burden (caused by the thief) is now too high.
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:54:57
Because they are fast, cheap (because of the data mining) and most people have nothing to hide with most of their transactions (coffee, dipers, food etc). If you want to perform a transaction without this node knowing about it, you can always go to another node or directly to the blockchain. And it won't be that easy for the node to identify you : all they know is your Bitcoin address and ip address (and using Tor the ip address goes out of the window). 
They will probably have an easier time identifying the merchant, because payments must be routed to a certain constant identifier. This identifier does not have to be a Bitcoin address, so you can also keep your payment channel contract private for the rest of the network. 
And the merchant is free to open multiple payment channels with different nodes to obfuscate for instance their sales volume. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:48:15
Sidechains are not the correct answer to scalability problems. The correct answers are:
See also  for a better explanation. 
And a similar idea of someone who came up with it independently as it seems:
@_date: 2015-05-29 05:31:20
To understand you first need to know about payment channels.  See for instance 
Let's say Alice wants to pay Dave.  
Alice has an open payment channel with Bob.
Bob has 2 open payment channels, one with Alice and one with Charlie.
Charlie has 2 open payment channels, one with Bob and one with Dave.
Dave has an open payment channel with Charlie.
Let's say that's the current state of all payment channels is that both parties receive 0.5 BTC.
Let's say Alice wants to send to 0.1 BTC to Dave.
Even though Alice does not have a payment channel with Dave, a route can be found through Bob and Charlie and all their payment channels are updated.
After this transaction the state of the payments channels will be:
Alice - Bob : 0.4 - 0.6
Bob - Charlie : 0.4 - 0.6
Charlie - Dave : 0.4 - 0.6
Notice that the middle layer (Bob and Charlie) are not losing any money, because the decrease in one payment channel is compensated by the increase in another payment channel. 
The clever thing about the lightning network is that all these changes to the payment channels happen either all of them or nothing changes in any payment channel (if for instance Charlie cannot reach Dave and another route cannot be found).
Another clever thing about the lightning network is that everyone can leave the lightning network without requiring permission from someone else, and can drop the current state of its payment channels on the bitcoin blockchain.  And this does not affect the operation of the rest of the lightning network.
And if there are a lot of participants in the lightning network, you do not have to open more than one payment channel (unless you want to be part of the middle layer to provide services).  This payment channel can be open for years without ever actually creating a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain (except one when opening the payment channel).

It's not just that storage and bandwidth are a problem. An even bigger problem in my view are the transaction costs. This prevents the micro payments economy from taking of. This is now 'solved'  by companies like ChangeTip which is not decentralized. 
With the lightning network we have it all. It's literally a 100     billion dollar idea. This is the missing link: now Bitcoin can support the entire world economy, including everything that is missing in the current economy, like instantaneous sending of 1 millionth of a cent.

Either we want Bitcoin to be a global currency in which significant hardware will be required to run a full node (even with LN), or remain limited, in which case I expect another currency to take over. 
The ambition of wanting to run the world's financial system on a home computer is unrealistic.

The success of Bitcoin also depends on people being able to grasp this concept.  Currently it is somewhat explainable to outsiders.  With something like tree chains this goes of the window. KISS!  (Keep it simple stupid).

Let's say 3% increase a week. Let's say 20% of the miners want to spam to increase the size. This means a 0.6% increase a week because of spam: 1.006 ^ 52 = 1.36. An annual increase of 36% a year because of this attack. 
Not a problem I think.

I agree. I think there is only one possible solution which does not result in a fork: Core should put a significant blocksize increase in the code, to be activated simultaneously with segwit activation. Preferably supplemented with an annual increase.

Transactions should fund the proof of work, but this is only viable if there are a lot of transactions with a low fee per transaction. If the transaction fee in Bitcoin is substantially higher than other payment systems, mass adoption will not occur.

The power of turing complete contracts is also that it harnesses the creativity of developers. Look at  to see all the stuff that has already been created. Of course only a small part will actually be used, but at least people (who are not core developers) can create stuff. And that is soooo important to get people enthusiastic about a technology. If you are a developer, but not a core developer, but an outsider, and you have a free Sunday, what can you do with Bitcoin?

Any application that involves decentralized finances requires the immutable property, which is why we have blockchains. They have made some browser applications that connect to Web servers that connect to Ethereum nodes. And the Web server could be Apache or anything else. And these applications can now use their own contract backend on Ethereum.
So it is partly a  conventional app, the novelty is the immutable customizable backend, which is piggybacking on Ethereum, so they don't have to reuse the wheel with respect to blockchain fundamentals, and can make use of the shared security properties of the large blockchain.

The drawback of the Strawpay approach is that the merchant has to trust that the issuer will pay after they have already serviced the consumer. It is not trustless, the entire process is not atomic like the lightning network. I think this is why it's not always mentioned in articles such as above.
