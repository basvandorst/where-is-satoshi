I do not think that either. But there is a clear influence of the speculation on the price of bitcoin, and thats in part the reason it price varies so much (+ 500% in a year).I think that what happend in South Korea is other thing, because you can buy bitcoins to anyone in the world so if the price of mining is very high that doesnt have to change the price.

HODL Today I found this in my University gruop: 
[...something like that, actually the term used is mine.
Anyway I have already move on, the fashion was when 20 USD  =1 BTC, but today the price is much lower. And I do not think it will go back to that price.]

Dollar against Bitcoin. There will be some minimum more? I ask this following the majority bassist of this forum, which is totally logical that it is and that must necessarily be bearish at this point of the fall. I think so, that may be, but it is difficult. In fact only Bitfinex set a new minimum today, the other markets, no. I also think that, in the case of giving, it would be very marginal below 7800 as 5 of 5 of 5 of E of B of all the setback started in December but that does not change anything with respect to the general bearish structure of my previous posting . And, naturally, I believe that direct increases to 8890-9150 cancel any possible additional minimums and that will enable a huge blast in the product. The feelings must now be negative, very negative, and the horrible news, just the horrible news will make the bitcoin go up, not the good news. This is the market.
