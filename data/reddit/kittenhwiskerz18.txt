What is my perfect crime? I help a banker buy bit coini I gain her trust I break in to her  houses at midnight. Do I go for the safe? No, I go for the bitcoin wallet on her laptop. It's unlocked and She didn’t back it up, As I’m transferring the coin, the banker catches me. She tells me to stop. She sold her fathers burger business to buy bitcoin. She's Wendy and  It’s her bitcoin. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting because bit coin has surpassed 1mil per BTC. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the bitcoin wallet.

I spend at least 100 a week on my ent habits but decided to take a break for a weak, I got in a little under 10k did some trading for a couple days 
now a week later I cashed out have my same bit coin plus enough for two more weeks of my ent habits, and you no what I get a better high watching bit coin go up and haven’t had an ent craving I a couple days. 
Thank you bitcoin you saved me.
-my lungs 
Some like to invest and some like to gamble 
And if gambling means I’m saving money and lung capacity even if it crashes and I lose the value I would still have my bitcoin and smoke free lungs 
I go to Vegas with the mindset of: this is your gambling money expect to lose it, but  enjoy the ride 
Winning will be nice too but it’s about the ride not the destination.
Just don’t be the guy at the craps table who stole money from his wife and snuck away to casino to come gamble and brag about it, that’s when you really don’t have money to “bet” 
That’s who I think op is talking about.
