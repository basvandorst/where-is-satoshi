Any form of centralization or middle-men will wither away thanks to Blockchain technology! Coinbase is just another middle man, you're absolutely right!

these are not leveraged trades, its exactly the opposite, if you deposit one Bitcoin you're only allowed to withdraw in Fiat a percentage of your collateral, lets say 50%, and your collateral is only sold if Bitcoin drops 50%

No, they should create (or adopt) a new economic system that won't collapse, instead of covering up the holes. And guess what, if the world economy really did collapse, carrots wouldn't stop growing from the dirt, neither would cows and pigs disappear, water would still flow in the rivers, we wouldn't lose the recipe for concrete or cement, our copper reserves would not vanish, etc. This is the kind of stuff  we need to survive, this is our economy, not meaningless paper. What you call a "world economy collapse" are only numbers going down because of the deeply flawed system we live in. Economy =/= Money, Economy = Resources.

Mt Gox volumes represent a small percentage of the volume traded, if it was ever traded at all, the only evidence is that they were deposited on exchanges. And Binance is okay, so are the users so these news were not the ones that dipped the market, it was the traders and their sell walls in conjunction with diminishing public interest
