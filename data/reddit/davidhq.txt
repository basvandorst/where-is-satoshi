not recently, no... and Webroot reported this after I haven't installed anything for 1 week at least for sure... so the report didn't immediately follow any download or install..
@_date: 2014-09-09 07:12:52
Thank you again....
Something else popped into my mind yesterday... even without warez, you can get something terrible... in fact this CoinThief was mostly spread via Bitcoin Ticker opensource project on GitHub.... :/
So I'm thinking I have to change my entire approach... now knowing two things: like I mentioned - the possibility to get something bad only with trying different open source code... and the fact that it can take more than a year for some threats to be recognized by antimalware software.... I guess the only right way from the beginning is to use a separate computer that is not connected to the internet for storing the main chunks of virtual currency...
Thank you for the hints regarding virtual machines as well....

Terence is cute, but WRONG
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:19:33
yes, it takes up to 10 days, right? I also thought about wiring some small amount but 10 days was too long, the money would go into a black hole.

Should I uninstall webroot then :)
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:58:23
I found this interesting analysis: 
And this from somewhere else:
`The previously discovered versions of CoinThief installed browser extensions for Safari and Chrome that monitored browser traffic and watched for log-in attempts on pre-loaded Bitcoin exchanges such as Mt. Gox and BTC-e, and wallet sites such as blockchain.info. The extensions, meanwhile, are generically named “Pop-up Blocker,” and arrive with an equally generic description that wouldn’t raise suspicions with the user or security researchers.`
I didn't have any "popup blocker" extensions in Chrome or Safari...
So it looks like this trojan intercepts traffic to exchanges but doesn't look for local wallets, right?
I don't understand this: `If Handsoff is not installed the backdoor will be made persistent by creating a fake Googe Software Update launch agent.`
@_date: 2014-09-06 15:32:42
So no need to upload? Here is something anyway:  .. not sure if these are infected files... they were in that folder.. there is something else (supposedly 080.dSYM and 081.dSYM) in Webroot's quarantine but I don't want to Restore the files if you say the analysis has already been done.
I was hoping that Webroot would protect me from this trojan doing anything - do you think it has? I haven't lost any BTC, I use Electrum, but haven't used it in recent days.
Do you really think it's neccessary to reformat? I'd rather not do that buecase since last backup it has been 2 months and as I said first I hope webroot protected me and second that it managed to remove the threat too (I hope before it even became a threat)...
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:33:14
maybe that explains the sudden discovery on my machine... I'll ask them when it was added... still february is a long time ago... is such long period usual in other antivirus vendors?
Could it be I didn't loose BTC because this malware doesn't track electrum? Also could Webroot keylogger prevention feature prevent it from working?
I have most of my BTC in other electrum wallets that I don't touch... but still I need to make sure my comp is clean and do what I can to be even more secure in the future. My backup is from june... so it might also be infected.. I can check if `~/Library/Application Support/.com.google.xupdater` exists...

You're probably right ... and I will also choose the former...
I don't know if it will be just one weekend, but could be... but for example this is my menu bar: 
And also: 
    david ls -la | wc -l
    298
:) 
and I tweaked every setting in the OS and in the apps...
the best would be if I buy a new computer and then use this one as a reference when setting a new one :) I actually planned to get a new Mac but maybe not this year yet... 
but surely it seems more work than it is.. because the most was figuring out what to tweak, now I just have to redo it, not figure everything out anew.
Ok, going to sleep now as well :} thank you for everything so far
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:48:19
UPDATE: actually the date on it says April 25th 2013!! I wasn't paying attention to the year... that's strange.. maybe it just set that date, because it didn't exist until Feb 2014
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:01:29
so both detect it but I don't know if they use a free version at VirusTotal

@_date: 2014-09-06 20:16:25
this has the best description: 
When run, the malware installs a browser extension in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, which will appear in those apps as “Pop-Up Blocker 1.0.0″ with the description “Blocks pop-up windows and other annoyances.” There are some indications that this name and description were also taken from a legitimate browser extension. The browser extensions watch your web traffic, looking for specific headers for bitcoin-related websites. They communicate with the background process, which will periodically connect to a remote server (currently offline) to exfiltrate login credentials.
The background process is set to be constantly running via a launchd task. Additionally, the background process will check for the presence of Bitcoin-Qt, and appears to be modifying components of Bitcoin-Qt, possibly with the intent of leaking private keys.
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:47:05
I checked and it's in the backup too... I got it on Apr 25
here is the complete archive: 
can you analyze it? I cannot really conclude what is it doing from the description on the net... So if it scans electrum and all the site logins etc? Strange I didn't loose anything so far... I use 2factor auth on all the exchanges...
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:17:32
It looks like MPK functionality has been implemented... it says on the website.
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:41:19
OK... if I understand correctly in addition to that system process there have to be browser extensions as well which send information to server through the process? I didn't have extensions which is strange...
I found another backup (cloned drive) from just before I got this trojan.... it will still be a lot of work to set everything up but *much* better than from zero...
If I didn't have that backup I would maybe try to rationalize that something would already have happened in 5 months if I had some additional malware... I know, ... but I haven't reinstalled OSX in 5 years or so.. I'd probably spend 2 weeks setting up just basics (dev environment, all apps etc.).
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:22:51
I found out where I got this... and when more or less... it was supposedly 8 months before it was first discovered.. so I was an early adopter... :/
So I really buy 99% (or even 100% ultimately) of my apps but when I'm not sure I need it, I test it first (sometimes for more time than trial period allows.. if it does)... and this happened with Pixelmator... I still have the file on my external drive and it scans positively for OSX.CoinThief... I bought Pixelmator through appstore soon afterwards.
Anyway, here are some screens: 
This version of Pixelmator came out in May 2013 and it looks like I downloaded the infected copy in june...
Here is the archive: 
I really think that it didn't manage to install itself completelly (no browser extensions and no consequences for me in all that time)... but still I'm very happy I got alerted finally.
Can I somehow be sure that this is the only malware in that Pixelmator archive? Please tell me if now that I know where it came from I still have a chance of not reinstalling everything? Does it change anything? I think the only other app in that period that I didn't pay for initially is PhpStorm.. I also have this archive on my external drive.
And yes it was stupid to even play with fire like that (but this was before I knew that there are threats on OSX too now or that not all are caught by protection immediately)... and especially because I actually enjoy paying for great apps... just that some don't offer enough trial or at all. Actually I didn't use Pixelmator even once until now, but it looks nice and I plan to :)

Yes, but it's worth sacrificing a few devices so that Apple reverses their decision... tomorrow! ;) Or maybe this can make Bitcoin community look savage, who knows. Probably the latter but I agree something has to be done about that stupid stupid decision at Apple, but it's hard.

Bitcoin is fighting hard to become an altcoin and doing a very good job.
It's in its own little reverse bubble, getting bigger every day.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:40:13
True but so far nothing was capable of replacing it by doing the same equally good or better, and maybe doing something else on top of this. The only problem for that newcomer was network effect and first-mover advantage... which IMHO is not enough anymore... when something is 2-10x better already these stop being important...

but where to sell bitcoin in brazil to get reals? if I do it through  then I need a local bank account... the only option IMHO would be to find locals who would buy bitcoins and give me BRL in person..
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:15:43
thank you, that was very helpful.. but I have registered on the site (I speak portuguese) and will explore the options.
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:37:17
Sure, I would have a paper in a safe with complete seed for family (maybe reversed and I would tell them that)... but when I move around I want to have it on my computer... and I don't want to store it whole in my computer... so again: is removing 3 words from it safe or should I move out 4 or 5?

@_date: 2013-03-24 16:32:13
hmm now it appeared after I restarted Electrum again... it seems it has some problems... like I already posted 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:03:36
yes, that's a valid concern... been thinking about that as well.. and will be thinking more :) could be that this is a show-stopper because the address has to absolutely be correct and trusted. Maybe I'll evolve this into something else... or investigate a bit more if the use for donations via twitter could be big enough.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:17:16
Ok, thank you for the notice... I calculated that if it takes 1s for each try, it would take 130 years... but yes, it probably doesn't take a second for a try... I mean on each try, the cracking program would have to check the address if any BTC are in it... if so, then it's a match... hmm but it still wouldn't take a second because it could just inspect the downloaded blockchain data (at first I thought it would have to ping blockchain.info :).
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:57:53
I also sold my 5 shares... lost 1.2 BTC on that shit. I'll survive. Gambling is for idiots anyway.

I have the latest version and it's buggy.. I haven't lost coins thankfully, but I don't know if I'll use it in the future... :(
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:58:52
yes I kinda thought so.. but then this means that prices listed in BTC will keep falling... of course... if a car now costs 200 BTC it might cost 1 BTC in 10 years, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:19:01
and the rest keep for longterm (until $50-$100 or 0 :)
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:17:04
here: 
it's shown to be instantaneous.... is the solution that the seller checks buyer's well known phone app (blockchain.info in this case) and sees that the buyer really paid? Or does a notification already pop up on his iPad "terminal" in seconds? in my experience it takes a few minutes when you are receiving funds to Electrum for example...
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:00:41
by your calculation the company would be worth 500 mio and not 50 million dollars.

in Electrum look for the 'receive' address and transfer your coins to that address from coinbase
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:18:29
Are you sure it was that low? I don't see it in the charts.. now it's $5.7. I'll probably sell half at $10 :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:44:32
I have one general address with small change in it... then I give that to people that will send me some BTC. 
How are you doing it? Are you generating a new address each time you request btc from someone?
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:14:29
Reverse is better than nothing... I want my family to have the seed written somewhere (and be very careful where they store the paper)... so reversing it is something but I just got an idea... on the reverse address I would make a few transactions in and out, leaving something like 0.01 BTC in there... so when someone tries this seed, they will see an active wallet and maybe will think that's it... 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:52:28
heey! I also have BiPoLaR. fun, isn't it? :p

I don't really care what they think if it goes to zero. I told them as far as I'm concerned.. I don't need such friends that will hold me accountable - then they're just stupid and can't think for themselves... really I don't. If it goes to 100k, they'll be happy and here I also don't care if they hold me accountable... I want them to benefit.
And I didn't tell them to invest 10k... just $300-$1500
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:09:39
yes when you try to send bitcoins out it asks for a password... if someone got hold of your passphrase they could send funds elsewhere without any passwords.
If your computer crashes, all you need to have is a passphrase... without any backups or pub/priv keys.
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:55:07
It is also possible to create anonymous addresses like 
@_date: 2013-04-05 20:54:14

Mining with a normal computer will probably not get a lot of BTC.. you will probably spend more electricity than you will earn coins
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:46:34
it's an experiment hacked together in 1 day :) it could grow into something more advanced (like the contacts functionality that I mentioned etc.). 
I posted it here exactly to find out if there is some use for this at all...
I don't believe people will be entering the url in their wallets... maybe some :)
I see one use for this when you're on the phone and want to give someone your btc address... it's much easier to tell them the url.. and if the service becomes known then you would just say I'm John at coin.sx.. Will see :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:53:46

Interesting, thanx! Actually I'm going to Brazil in may... 
So what should I do? Open an account on that site and send some bitcoins over then sell them for R$? How do I get that money out of my virtual account? With a bank transfer to a Brazilian account? What if I don't have any Brazilian friends, how would I get the paper money when I'm in Brazil? tnx!

@_date: 2013-03-25 10:16:25

@_date: 2013-04-17 10:00:15
I tried to day-trade about 3 times. Once I made a little money, but I lost much more other two times. so never again
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:06:19
thanx! but still if I paid for beer then they would check that the transaction appeared in ther wallet, right? This could sometimes take a few minutes... also not that good.. 
so yes, I guess that some trust system on top of everything will be used. am I correct?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:48:21
Yes it's secure... just use a good password on top of the seed. And write a seed down on a paper and store it in a safe place... you can leave 2 or 3 words out (replace them with placeholders) and store them somewhere else
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:32:59

My question: I noticed Electrum is a bit buggy (not showing the history properly and you have to restart)... on some other thread someone mentioned that he lost some coins (small amounts thankfully) due to Electrum bugs... Any info on that?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:15:11
I'll just tell them to go to reddit or other sources and get educated. I don't have such stupid friends that can't think for themselves.
And all you wussies that are scared you'll be held accountable - so you're not prepared to expose yourself even a tiny bit for the sake of a great thing? You don't want it to spread or you just want to have all the coins? Normal people need to be in it to for it to work.
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:05:27
thank you! I sold all my stocks and bitcoins and bought a parcel on the moon! I think this has even higher potential.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:41:47
eeeh. how could you do that.. you'll fix it but it's no fun... a friend did the same today with her deposit for 1 BTC :) she wrote one 6 too much.. we had to write to the exchange
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:58:37
bitstamp guys are from Slovenia! it's a good service.. I use them.. clean interface, it works, 2-factor authentication etc. The only thing is that prices are sometimes a bit higher to buy than on MtGox.. but it's worth it IMHO.. and it's normally not that much of a difference
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:52:07
It's "interesting" how they don't see that people will want to use a mobile phone for local purchases with Bitcoins... this will only hurt apple because that's a very good reason to switch to Android... I think that in time they'll reconsider their decision - I hope.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:43:12
yes... via  and also  I think

@_date: 2013-03-24 16:33:50
It really seems that Electrum could function better...
I had problems with pruned transaction outputs (not seeing the actual transactions), unknown transactions (no date or details) and the most recent transaction not showing up.. after a restart it's sometimes better and sometimes it takes multiple restarts.
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:13:17
GREAT! Thank you very much!
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:49:25
also in email or generally anywhere when you want to give out your receive address you always have to go to the wallet and copy it out.. this way it's much easier for the sender but yes, the receiver has one intermediate step to make (opening a browser). What do you think - is this advantage for the sender big enough?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:33:54
Stupid people are only those that didn't do a research/thinking for themselves. Besides it's all "meta"... everything you do regarding bitcoin has influence on the total market (rise, fall, crash)

I looked on Wikipedia but I don't understand this scheme...
I would only use such scheme for one of my wallets with minimal amount of BTC... other wallet seeds would be in an ecrypted TrueCrypt volume..

there is if you have BTC... just use btc-e.com (hmm down now?) or vircurex.com (seems more secure anyway)...
