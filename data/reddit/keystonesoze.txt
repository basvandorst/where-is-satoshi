This is dumb. 
These are more like the executives of various firms. 
would Chase shutdown by knocking on Jamie Dimon's door? Nope. Someone would just replace him.
These are influential figures in bitcoin's ecosystem, particularly the mining side. However, they are not nearly as powerful as implied.

same story with buying into anything whether it be a stock or property. 
speculators buying today have a dream price in mind. speculators buying ten years from now will a dream price in mind. 
As for everyone else, they'll buy in if they need to. If they want to place a bet on the Super Bowl. If they want to buy some weed and live in a non-green state. If they want to use whatever other services are developed by then...


If you're going down that route, how does it not apply to other currencies? Dollars, pesos, yuan... every currency in the world is essentially exceedingly hoarded by a minority. That's the state of the world. The wealthy class exists and it isn't going away. At least Bitcoin has a creation method that is transparent, unlike the dictators and tyrants of the world with their flick-of-the-wrist monetary policies and unsavory methods of revenue generation...

Alright, since you seem to have familiarity with online gambling, we'll stick with it. Provably fair gaming, and I mean truly provably fair gaming, is still not the industry standard, let alone decentralized and provably solvent ones. The most popular books today aren't the best ones, just the most convenient due to (out-dated) regulations. 
You keep harping about liquidity, but it seems you're only thinking of it in terms of an individual market (question) on Augur. That isn't a fair definition of liquidity in this case.  Augur's markets can tap into Bitcoin's liquidity via Ether and access that, if the market on Augur demanded it. 
Augur applies to far more than just gambling. It is attacking the price of information. Every huge rumor can be cut down into more manageable ones. People can slice up periods of uncertainty into time-frames of their choosing. This is another step towards truly personal finance.

It isn't odd at all. 
Appetite for risk is down. 
Bitcoin has lofty goals, and with it, comes a lot of risk. 
It is also really difficult to gauge the effects of other factors. Take the forex market for instance. Historically, "safe" currencies tend to perform well when appetite for risk is down ( Swiss CHF, Japanese Yen, USD). How big of an impact does this have on BTC markets? Very, very hard to say. 
Some people will focus on the market cap of bitcoin (which imo is very misleading, but that's another discussion): at today's price, mkt cap stands below $4B, which puts it alongside small/mid-cap equities. While it may not be entirely fair to compare them, a large number of investors are probably right to continue to treat it like a small-cap stock. 
On top of all the fireworks in other markets, we're seeing significant disruptions to major players in the bitcoin industry. Bitfinex's troubles add to the uncertainty, Igot (not big, but still another smear), etc.
These are turbulent times. Buckle in, reduce leverage, hedge... do whatever you have to do to maintain a (relatively) clear head during these periods. 
Although we aren't in the midst of a global meltdown (2008), these slides in other markets are helping bitcoin. The vast majority of these now/soon/eventually disillusioned investors (fiat holders) may not be "one of us" yet, but I sure as hell would be willing to bet someone is getting their feet wet for the first time.
These are good/interesting times for bitcoin, even if the market doesn't agree resoundingly.

crude example:
I live in Country A. You live in Country B.  We have different local currencies. While it may only cost X amount to complete the transfer (kind of like postage stamps), what you receive isn't what I sent. If I paid $108 ($100+$8 fee) to send $100 to you, you'd expect to receive the equivalent of $100. Instead, you find out that you ultimately received the equivalent of $90. So while the transfer only "cost" $8 in fees, the remaining difference of $10 ($100-$90) is due to the exchange rate. Services like WU, Travelex, etc make a killing on the exchange rates. 
Buy low, sell high. These exchangers do this all day long, every day. They don't care what the forex markets have determined to be the exchange rate, they'll tack on a little extra spread for themselves. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:34:18

It's actually quite a believable answer. Many people have been ruined by poor business decisions. Tyson was never a businessman. He had people for that. He had people managing nearly every aspect of his life, and not everyone had his best interests at heart.
Perhaps his mistake was focusing too much on boxing and not enough on business. Or listening too much to a business manager. Too trusting. Too naive. 
Lots of people will blame "the economy" Nowadays, it's kind of a general phrase referring to outside factors. 
That being said, of course Tyson and the other decision makers in his camp are to blame whenever an 8 figure fortune melts that quickly. I'm just saying, you're perspective on Tyson's situation seems very short-sighted.

You do realize that fiat currencies have crashed as well right? 
People earned their money, then saw that money devalue, sometimes wildly and without enough warning, or without enough resources to weather the storm. 
I saw firsthand what happens when a currency crisis breaks out. I was in secondary school at the time, but when Asia was melting down in 1997, many lives were ruined. Lower class, middle class, upper class; people all around were being ruined. Some of the worst hit were middle-upper class. Why? Outstanding obligations. They were the ones that could afford to send kids to foreign schools (say, Korean kids going to University in the USA). So that tuition bill, which was based in USD, and being paid in Korean Won, just got a lot more expensive, even though the price of tuition stayed the same. You know that 9/11 footage of people jumping off a Tower rather than burning to death? Shit was like that all over Korea and elsewhere. There were so many suicides, carried out in so many different ways. Salaried workers, farmers, investors; people from all corners of the economy were hurt. That IMF crisis really  made an impact on my family and people I grew up with. It really left an impression on me.

No shit. It's to illustrate who has the burden. Verification of funds is an ongoing problem. Every fiat currency has their own formats and protection measures.

You stepped out and made the statement, "Nobody needs bitcoin."
Others replied, and you've now returned with an even dumber statement. 
The thing is, even if someone spent the time to lay it all out for you, it doesn't seem like you would get it. 
However, just to play along. Let me ask you this. Are you familiar with the markers that are used to check if a bill is legitimate? I crack up whenever I see a cashier holding a bill up to the light, or having to take the marker out and check any "large" bills. The year is 2015, and we have a system that requires every person to be an expert in their fiat currency. I don't work at the Treasury. I don't know all the details to look for. Why do I need to spend money on a marker, or on a bill counter, or a change separator/roller... just to utilize my money? There are improvements to be made.
Without even getting into economic theory, or all the other topics of discussion that Bitcoin brings about, even an idiot can see that Bitcoin is doing something.

At this stage, the only working model I believe in when it comes to earning interest on BTC holdings involves lending to traders seeking leverage.  Some exchanges / trading services are pursuing this model, but a decentralized and fully transparent option has yet to materialize. 
BTCjam and other loan sites simply don't work due to default risk. which is a travesty because default risk doesn't even have to exist. Until they change the way their system works, it is no different than a casino, one that isn't even provably fair. Prognosis is grim in its current state, though I am mildly optimistic about its future.

Nobody seems to be able to answer this question. I love bitcoin but I can't help but be critical of the 21 computer because nobody seems to be capable of explaining any capabilities that it has which are unique.

It does however, make it easy for people, such as a parent shoppin' for holiday gifts, to grab something Bitcoin related. It's not just a wallet (the fun in those is having lots of coins).
The 21.co reminds me of the early RadioShack ads. This is about tinkering and playing around, having fun with a toy, by doing stuff it. Lego blocks took ideas from engineering, architecture, etc to make a wonderful platform for toys. 21.co can do something similar with programmable money. Cloning a git repo is like grabbing a DIY-kit . Instead of building walkie talkies and computers, a new generation is playing with network-backed devices. 
The programmable money app boom has just started. 2016 is going to be crazy. Bitcoin's blockchain is coming up on its 7th year. Kids born on the same day as the Genesis block are just starting elementary school. 
What will bitcoin's ecosystem look like by the time these kids are graduating high school? 
So pick "it" and run with "it" however you want to see "it"

"HSBC was accused of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from HSBC Mexico, allowing for money laundering, prosecutors said. The bank also violated U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba, according to a criminal information filed in the case."
Not that long ago.

Mr. Finney left many interesting posts behind.
He covers a broad range of topics, there's a little something there for everyone.
