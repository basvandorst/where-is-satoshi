Thank you. Very informative.

Thank you for great info. Learned a lot!
Maybe one followup question. Was there a stage of difficulty level where varying the nonce only wasn’t enough?
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:37:18
First time i hear this. Interesting. How does mining software do this in practice since there is constantly transactions added to the mempool? Isnt the hash based on previous whole block header hash, nonce plus a timestamp?
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:20:57
Good point. Easier to print than withdraw.

Interesting paper. How would you see the situation if in fact fiat start to loose value and central banks start to withdraw fiat from circulation? They can print and withdraw as they like to regulate the value. This wasn’t a factor earlier but could be in the future. How would the model work then?

Yes. Understanding Poisson distribution helps to understand how it works and why you need to look at at least a few days average blocktime to get estimate on hashrate. The 2weeks retarget is a very good value actually. Personally i would look at a rolling 2 week average to determine hashrate.

Break bitcoin ok sounds good!
@_date: 2019-10-01 10:44:42
Haha really ok

Thanks for sharing this. I learned something related to money stock of usd and btc. I always thought btc inflation was higher that usd/eur fiat at least until next halving based in those published inflation numbers.
So actually already now btc inflation is lower than fiat.
Long term this should have big impact on btc price even if it does not get super wide spread use.
Good insight.

Thanks for the tip. Will check it out.

The Ledger Live software on PC that works with the nano s is super slow. Keep crashing when trying to synchronize. Anything more than a few hundred transactions history and it cant handle it. Note that its not signing on the ledger which i can understand could get overheated if you sign huge amount of i puts. Its simply the software just syncing(no nano connected)
(All BTC one app)
Support is actually suggesting me to restore my seed in a software wallet and then consolidate all transactions to try again. Thats some risk doing that.
Their chrome extension app used before works perfect so I’m using that. But its no longer updated.
If they fix Ledger Live software it could be good again.

What i tried to explain is that kWh is a unit used by convenience to measure energy but it quickly get confusing once you start use it for power too.
Do you say it’s 100mph speed between point A to point B? Thats not a correct statement. What you could say is it’s 100mph speed for one hour between A and B, technically correct. OR you could simply say distance is 100miles.
Practical calculation wise perhaps what you say is correct but it’s not that simple. The unit kWh is a measure of energy. The unit kW is a measure of power. Power is energy per time unit. They are different concepts same way as speed and distance are different. 
In the article it’s mixed up. Numerically yes lot of the calculation may be correct but from physics standpoint they are not. My issue is how the words energy and power are used wrong in the article.
You cant say “power per bitcoin”. Its written a few times in the article. If we talk technology and science i think we have to use proper terms so we all understand what we are talking about. If we did there wouldn’t be confusion like what has happened in this thread with people trying to clarify.

Anyone got any experience with this how it handles many unspent transactions? Say around a 100? 
Ledger Live cant handle it so looking for alternative.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:24:42
There is another argument here. People have to spend to live. Rent, food. Businesses have to operate etc. So you are forced to spend your coins regardless. The value of bitcoin may reflect this. Some just keep due to deflation but some will get spent and market will determine what value it means including the fact that some dont spend, invest etc. scarcity value is affected.
It could just be a number where deflation doesnt matter much in a high speed economy with instant settlements etc.

Same here i also feel its gotten a lot worse past few months. Its just way too much low effort preaching to the choir adding no substance. You have to look deep in to the comments for any value add but this get tiring after a while. I am especially disappointed one cant follow what is actually going on surrounding bitcoin development. Sure you hear occasionally about lightning network but again its mainly one liners. Where are the detail discussions?
Compare this sub to say the Tesla sub which i also follow. Very high quality discussions, friendly and informative. 
Bitcointalk is pretty much dead.
As far as i know all the dev talk is on discords but they are all spread out.

Thats just incorrect. Its only a problem if a single entity start to control 51%. Nothing indicates that at the moments. Just seem a lot of new miners coming online which are probably spread out over the world.
Assuming we are at average efficiency of 80J/TH right now we are at 7.5GW of power running all the machines. Thats like 10 typical nuclear reactors or an entire major dam in China(eg Xiangjiaba).
For 51% you need 51% of this power with same average effiency or if you could get all S17 pro miners you could get by with less in 25-30% range meaning still 2.5GW of power at least. To get that requires an enormous effort and investment. You also need to sustain this 51% hashpower for substantial amount of time to be able to overtake main chain. 
Bitcoin is more secure than ever.

Bitmain operates the pool. The miners on the pool can be from all over the world, they choose which pool and whether to mine which coin etc. To do a attack you have to control the miners to stay on the pool. You need to sustain 51% hash rates for significant amount of time to overtake main chain. There is no way pool operators would get a way with this without miners noticing.

How many unspent transactions have you had at any single time? I start to have huge issues once it approaches 100. The chrome one never had issues.

Power(W=J/s) is energy(J as in Joules) per timeunit(s as in seconds).
These constantly get mixed up, same with electric cars where people mix up charging speed, consumption, motor power output and battery capacity. Always the kW and kWh and hows its used. That little “h” makes all the difference.
The issue is the unit kWh which is just a trick to quickly calculate how much energy is generated/consumed in an hour with constant power output. If we just kept it as joules and watts separately there wouldn’t be any confusion. Just as there is no confusion with miles and miles/hour, money and earnings/month, gallons and gallons/minute etc etc you get the idea.
In the article it’s stated how much power per bitcoin. The actual unit of that is J/(s*btc). Joules per btc seconds. Doesnt make sense. One could write that “at current difficulty one need to sustain x W poweroutput to maintain hashrate such that on average a block us found every 10 minutes average”. But much better would be to calculate how many joules required per block. Then you can convert that backwards to kWh. That would make most sense and clear to understand. 
Not trying to be smartass here(ok a little hehe) but hope this post can be of value to someone.

At current USD/TH profitlevels its more or less only hydropower and solar/wind which are profitable. You need to be at 12cents/kWh or lower to operate at 0.8J/TH average efficiency. 
No one is building large scale mining operations with power cost more than 4-6c/kWh and its only renewable power at that cost level.
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:29:51
Yeah its amazing how this little h has confused so much. Of course it doesnt help that energy as a concept is hard to get your head around compared to say distance. But then money is even worse :)
