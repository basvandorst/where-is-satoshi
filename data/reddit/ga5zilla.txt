I don't believe your intent here. Just feels like a huge advertisement and you are using BCH drama to gain popularity only as leverage

Soooooo what youre saying is.... No dude thats not what I am saying. I said I dont believe him because of the way his post his made. Like a sales pitch, with the website neatly placed 3/4 in &amp; because of his choice of words. He is clearly trying to sell you something because there is clearly incentive behind it.

Who told you to think rationally! How outrageous

thank you! I used the mycelium app on google play store to create a 10-word passcode. I kept using the wallet I had about 0.1 btc on it. My phone with the app died and was unsable. I tried with new phone to recover my wallet with the words I had written a year ago, and it wasnt working. I have a hard time believing that I could have made a mistake while writing the words or the order, but I dont see any other possibilities other then the mycelium app having an issue

I have lost my bitcoins because I somehow misswrote my secret words on paper when creating it. Probably 1 word or the order of them is wrong, do you believe the btcrecover tool will help me?

cool but dont advertise, kinda destroys your whole point

I have my 12 word list, sorry for the confusion. I just tried creating a new wallet and it ask to rewrite the 12 words. I think I messed up 1 word or the order of one of them

It seems the app accept limited amounts of words.. what stops people from making a script?
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:32:48
How legit is this site?
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:27:56
I get it. I do have the 12 words. I should look for ways to try every combinaison assuming I messed up 1 word or the order of them once?
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:33:25
I will try this, I appreciate you
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:23:34
I have tried that from few different devices, that doesn't seem to be the issue unfortunately
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:32:11
Maybe in a long time if I fail myself. I don't need it right away but I would never post it publicly
@_date: 2019-09-17 20:33:49
Not yet
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:26:40
No I haven't, is there an app you recommend? I think mycelium is a fair app and so I don't blame them and rather myself on this issue
