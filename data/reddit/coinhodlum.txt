That's definitely possible. Or these investors are just ignorant about all the red flags?
But, fair enough, haven't heard about the IEO being fake. And I used to read too much Bitfinex'ed so I'm definitely biased towards shady shit going down with them. Of course, I could be completely wrong.

Right, with crowdfunded cash that they gathered from LEO investors...

You never talk about your Bitcoins
@_date: 2018-09-27 11:38:13
Absolutely my thought as well
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:03:52
Touché :D

I sense that you're longing for 10K+ Karma points like the guy who posted that 180 degree arrow chart yesterday ;)

Thanks for pointing it out. You know, people in crypto are generally veeery sceptical cause this space is still riddled with traps and lawlessness. Nevertheless, have fun and make yourself at home here, just be careful!

Usually I don't curse on here, but fuck them. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:50:49
Well, good for them but can we please stop differentiating how many women or men or whoever do this and that? It's flat out irrelevant. Every human being invested in Bitcoin is smart in my book.

The most efficient way would be to set up your old wallet on your new PC with your old private key.
BUT if you really think you could've been compromised (including your wallet) then the best way would be, as you described it, to just create a new one and send them over. It doesn't have to be expensive if you don't need your coins instantly so you could just set a low tx fee and wait a little longer.

Nah you're being too optimistic. It'll be at -1000 tomorrow /s

Quality pun. Upvote!

He's kind of entertaining but I wouldn't put money on ANYTHING he says lol
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:58:40
^ What he said!

Sounds a bit like the revolutionary and ominous  Bitconnect bot, that was designed to "only make profit for everyone"

Look, people disagreeing with you is no reason to be a dick, Sir.

A multi billion Dollar company (facebook) doesn't always follow the rules. Op's suspicion is totally justified.

You're obviously projecting shit onto me man and that's all there is to it. Have a nice day/eve/lunch/breakfast/whatever.

It's not quite clear what caused it imo. There are theories about Tether, the leading stablecoin that can be printed out of thin air, being used to pump the price. Retail interest is still down (maybe up a little due to recent fomo kicking in) but buying volume is up tremendously, (ok except for the last bump to 8.7k) which leads some people to think it's institutions and pro investors flocking into this space.
After all, what it boils down to is there are more buyers than sellers, regardless of their nature ('manipulative' or 'natural') 
Bitcoin price is still highly speculative and 1000+ $ moves to the up- and downside are quite common.
Enjoy the ride!

Don't worry, I thought the same when it hit 6000ish in Jan/Feb. Just gotta be patient, look where we are now.

Good call, let's see how it's going to turn out next year.

Opinion: Bitcoin journalism is close to becoming worthless.
