Need that hoodie

Wow! I'll have to look into that more; I'm from MA (though, I just moved out a few weeks ago), and never knew this. That's crazy. Thanks for the heads-up on that.

Out of curiosity: why no NY or NH? What's going on there?

Upvoting for Gyft. They've been nothing but fantastic in my experience with them, and using Bitcoin with them.

I'm holding/spending/buying back when I spend. Started back in October 2013 (happy 1 year!), and have never panic sold. I believe in Bitcoin, and love being able to use it whenever possible. I just went on a road trip down the east cost about a month ago with a few friends, and booked our hotels every night using Bitcoin (cheapair.com). Felt pretty good--these friends always sort of "mocked" me about Bitcoin, so to be able to say "yeah, I got this with that 'fake internet money'". It definitely really opened their eyes to how much progress Bitcoin really has made.

I love you

This is the best thing I've ever seen. Thank you.

My favorite way to use Bitcoin is "Gyft". You can buy gift cards for most major retailers and whatnot, and it allows you to pay in Bitcoin. For example, I needed to buy a washing machine earlier this year. I was able to buy a $500 Home Depot gift card from Gyft with Bitcoin, and then purchased my washing machine.

The best time to buy was yesterday. The second best time is now.
On a more "serious" note: us that have been with Bitcoin for years will pretty much always say "yes" here because we've only seen it go up, and up, and up. We've lived through the crashes where it's gone down hundreds to thousands of dollars. There are going to be people who buy right now at, what, $10,450 or so and may see that price drop to $10,100 in the next hour. To that new person, that is earth shattering. But if you've been here long enough, you just shrug it off and think, "meh, that's just temporary. It will go back up. In fact, it's down now....I should buy more". The real truth, though, is that we never really know when it will stop going up, or when it will go down, so please only ever use money that you'd be okay with losing if that were to happen. If you buy in right now and it *does* go down, give it time. You'll see that it will go back up. Corrections need to happen.
Take this with you: no one who has ever bought and held on to their Bitcoin has regretted it (^yet )

I'm nervous, excited, scared, and happy at the same time

This is actually good news 
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:12:39
No worries at all in asking; I use Coinbase.com to buy my coins, and they have a feature set up where you can do automatic, periodic buys. Do you use Coinbase? If so, I can show you where to set that up.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:17:06
I just have an automatic buy of $100 worth of BTC every two weeks. I guess you could argue that I'm still buying at these prices, but it's more of me just setting a little money aside.

Good question. I honestly haven't done much research on that aspect of it yet since, surprisingly, I don't do much online shopping to begin with (I LOATHE shipping and handling). I feel like so many are popping, online especially, that that would be a lot harder to track. If I happen to find anything, I'll post on here for you!
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:38:57
I love this SO much. Thank you for this, OP. It's so exciting and interesting to actually see whats going on, globally, with BitCoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:46:39
I started laughing before even pressing play
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:13:13
Haha right?! Had the same reaction
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:34:36
Honestly, I would really only do this at kiosks, since those are mainly small business owned. As a retail manager myself for a major chain, I would have no say in this whatsoever haha if I were to bring it up to my District Manager right now, she'd just tell me to just focus on holiday and it would end at that. Again, you will obviously know your mall stores better than I would, but I wouldn't walk into, say, American Eagle and expect much right now. BitCoin will have to take most of the small business market before big name, mall store chains really catch on.

Sorry if n00bish question, but is there a sort of "income tax" set in place for being paid in Bitcoin by the employer?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:53:01
So happy she pointed that out. Someone HAD to say it.

As a reminder, if you're curious about what businesses accept BitCoin near you, just check out  ! I found 2 places I live 10 minutes from the accept BitCoin that I've never been to, and had no idea accepted. I will be going to both this week.
