Attack the point, not the figure of speech, you'll seem smarter that way.

The supply cap will only come into play in the ultimate long term IF bitcoin can be adopted. In the current speculative market, the supply still plays a factor relative to the limited amount of bitcoins that are in active circulation.

believe in your own logic.
All you need to know is that bitcoin can be mined. Anyone and their grandmas can shell out $2000 for an Antminer S9 and start passively making $400 net profit each month at current price levels.
There are many bitcoin entrepreneurs in China who are operating factories full of thousands of mining machines, even back when bitcoin was only a couple hundred dollars each. Recently the profit margins have been absolutely insane and they've been scaling up production to really cash in on dumb Americans donating their hard earned USD.
How long will this last? How much higher can it go? How many more Chinese bitcoins mass mined for dirt cheap can the maniacal hype swallow up? No one can tell you that for sure.

I mean new bitcoins, mined, created, new, bitcoins that are new on the market. Bitcoins that come from thousands of Chinese factories each housing thousands of antminers.

How long can the hype money keep up with all the new bitcoins being mined by everyone and their grandmas?
And when the scale tips to the latter, a cascade of selling will tear down this artificial high for good.

And that small, planned, transparent block reward offers a ROI in less than a year at current prices levels, difficulty considered.
That sounds too good for a business? Will market forces of supply and demand balance out? I wonder.

What if you die penniless and there was nothing to vanish?
