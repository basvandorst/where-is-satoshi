Sorey but I need to say this, Europeans are usually proud of being from their own country, people rarely identify themselves as Europeans, and also, Bitcoin is supposedly to be an alternative for the fiat currency, if the government starts to get involved it kinda loses his purpose.

I don't know Wall Mart, but I know that  IBM is investing in blockchain in many areas, and Microsoft was doing something related to Identification. You can check it online and prove your friend wrong.

Does your friend realize that IBM, Microsoft and Wall Mart are investing/using blockchain?

Depends. If you post an article online with the bitcoin logo with visual effects and if you include a quote from someone rich and famous. Everyone will believe you without hesitation. O

True, all this analyst opinions aren't truly biased. To be honest, if analysts with money invested in bitcoin would say bitcoin price will plumber but he/she will still hodl until it is worthless because he/she likes to be different from other investors, would you believe him/her?

Finally, I am tired of this edgy pre teens posts only show poeple being dicks, and pretending not to give a fuck, while they wasting time posting this so they can get the much needed approval from others "who don't give a fuck".

Even If you bought 0.01 when Bitcoin was at 6k, you would have spent around 60 Bucks, so if it reaches 100k, you would a profit of 940$, is a pretty good deal IMHO.

Is hard for BTC to be the world currency with the cap of 21M, or 21T Satoshi. So the avarage person could only have around 3000 sat
