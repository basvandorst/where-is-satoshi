your 20 bucks can be worth 1 dollar tomorrow. Do not seek confirmation from others to do investments. That is just pressure into doing something that MAY be stupid. Do what you think is smart.

Honestly, I'm just some fucking guy. Don't take financial advice from anyone that isn't a professional. 
That said, i do not know if it will continue to fall or not, but if you are really unsure, you can buy a bit now, and when you think it is at the lowest.
Buy low, sell high, right? Not the opposite.

If this is a longterm investment, it doesn't matter what it is right now. 
If you are paying attention on prices, all you should be concerned about is how much more you are willing to buy.

The money in my bank just went down due to small fees, so i bought gold, silver, BTC and LTC, looking into other alt coins.

Short term, go for alt coins.

Make a spreadsheet document. 
Lets call the current price A1. The amount that i buy is A2, i like to include fees, so lets make fees A3 (selling fee), and how much euros i spent is A4.
How i solve the math equation to get profit is this: 
=A1*A2 - (A3 +A4)
There you can see what your profit is.  Lets say that the profit is A9.
Lets make that a percentage. 
=A9/A4 
There you get the numbers, all you need to do is make that to a percentage by clicking the percentage icon.
Spent + profit is as simple as "=A4+A9"
If you want to see how much your gains is, if lets say LTC goes from 140 euros, to 150, its as simple as changing A1 to 150.

Thats my point, we're the one profiting from his recklessness. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:05
Knowing how long you're going to hold is a start.
I'm personally holding either a year or five years.
I'll say it again: If this is a longterm investment, it doesn't matter what it is right now.
If you are paying attention on prices, all you should be concerned about is how much more you are willing to buy. 
Everything else is unnecessary anxiety which can hamper total profitability. Some guy once said, "our favorite holding period is forever", that guy is Warren Buffet.
The guys that bought in 2013, and lost all "profit" due to the sudden sinkage, are rich now, if they held.

Honestly, if you are unsure, you shouldn't invest in something.
You are asking a subreddit that  has unconditional LOVE for Bitcoin.
Do your research, figure it out on your own. It is your decision, not ours to make.

No idea what it is for him. His mother died a couple of weeks ago, so i think he will spend the money which he got from her on Bitcoins.

I sold my wife and kids to the slave trade in Libya, best 200 dollar investment to BTC I've made. Just you wait, soon it will be worth 201 dollars, and then i am happy, and i will buy them back with one dollar in profit.
Edit: Turns out that the slave trade wants more than 200 dollars to get my family back, around a million dollars. I guess I'll have to wait a week to get a million and one dollars.

What has this to do with Bitcoin? I know that Slik Road was one of the first websites that used Bitcoin as an actual currency, but other than that - what is the relevance? It is a currency, not a pro-drugs agenda. How can people take cryptocurrency serious when we intentionally associate the currencies with things that technically has nothing to do with it? It is currency, like money you can spend it on things. It is like saying, "all you can do with bitcoin is to buy pizza"
