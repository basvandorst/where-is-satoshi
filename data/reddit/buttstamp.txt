Technical debt is relative to a project and usually results in slowed development.  In regard to Bitcoin, since it's a protocol and the goal is not to break old clients (backward compatible softfork), Segwit introduces some corner cases that can't be eliminated because it will break old clients.  (I'm speaking in general terms, I do not know the specific corner cases. I'd usually defer to a core dev like to explain, but he has been banned from reddit all together because of the shit faced liars in r/btc.)
In addition, an argument against the technical debt talking point, is that Segwit was added to the codebase 0.13.0.  Since then, 0.13.1, 0.13.2 have been release and 0.14.0 is almost completed.   Segwit obviously hasn't slowed Core down with "crippling technical debt"
Also most wallets and libraries have already implemented Segwit, evidenced below.  
So obviously real developers aren't having any issues with this so called "technical debt".  It's just another r/btc talking point that makes them sound smart, is easily repeatable and is difficult to refute in their little echo chamber.

To what exactly?   Is there another decentralized deflationary digital asset?   We have over 300 altcoins that are p2p digital cash, but Bitcoin is the only one being used as a store of value and racking up an increasing marketcap.   
I think that proves the killer app here is a digital store of value above all else.  Even with 3 tp/s.

Where is this currency coin going to come from?    We have over 300 competitors in the p2p cash space.  Pick a few shitcoins and hedge your bet.

Hardfork is a change that breaks all nodes.  It's basically like moving to a new internet, the main problem is what happens when some people don't want to upgrade to the new internet?  What if they are happy with the current internet?  They shouldn't have to move, and as such, we end up with two internets.. or two bitcoins.
The folks in r/btc have been clamoring for a hardfork for over 2 years.  It doesn't matter what kind of hardfork(XT,Classic,BU, or even Segwit), they just want a hardfork.    The scaling argument used to be about throughput increases, but at some point it stopped being about that.  
Segwit was carefully designed to improve the current bitcoin instead of forcing everyone to move to a new Bitcoin.   
Segwit softfork is superior to a hardfork in every way... unless you want two coins.

Everyone has learned how the sausage is made!  
Libra might be a dead end project, but the process of them standing in-front of government officials and educating everyone on how currencies are made has been a huge success to shatter the illusions around fiat.    
Bitcoin's long term value proposition stands out even more, in contrast.

The way this guy picks fights to try to get his company known, is my biggest gripe.  His subreddit has like 60 followers.  Read his website. His protocol is twice removed from bitcoin.
Bitcoin -&gt; etheruem -&gt; Eris.  If you think etheruem is off topic and meta, then Eris is the next step.  They're building a service that allows you to create a blockchain that the creator controls and then at any point make changes to the protocol without hard fork issues.    It is interesting, but it is not even remotely close to providing the utility that bitcoin provides.
You can't use this system for anything that requires zero trust.  And remember zero trust is the only reason bitcoin is a thing.  Otherwise this whole blockchain concept is pointless.  There's no reason to have "distributed" trusted network when a trustless one is possible.  Eris creates trusted blockchains.   That's like a caffeine free cappuccino .  Or an odorless cologne.  You can do it, but its pointless to the real thing.
Distributed consensus between unknown nodes is the invention.  Not the blockchain.
The blockchain yes, bitcoin no, folks don't have a clue.  For example Eris uses the example of a Youtube that is ran by blockchains.   Can you imagine that?  I work in software, and I can not grasp how that can possibly work or why you would do it in the first place.   Eris, if you have some real use cases, then please present them.  I'll have my imagination ready.

Bitcoin should be counter culture.  The punk rock of money.  Not just Bieber, not Taylor swift.   Not main stream.  IMO, Bitcoin is already a success, we just have to lay low and keep doing what we doing.The only reason you want it to go viral is so it will create another bubble.   bubbles are not sustainable.  We need stability based on actual usage and real use cases.  Not by being visa, but by being bitcoin.

18 months from now:What started off as an April fools joke is now a reality.  Greece releases the first crypto currency backed by a State.  Attached to bitcoin as a sidechain, Greece's crypto coin is the most secure currency in the world with a fixed inflation schedule to ensure they will never be held ransom in a debt shake down again.   Now the race is on.  Which country will be next and more importantly, which country will be last?  The age of centrally controlled inflationary money supply is coming to a close and Greece led the way.... Again.

Why is this a good idea ?   if you want bitcoin to succeed  you have to create demand.  This idea does not create demand.   What 21 inc should do is build Wifi access points that easily connect together to form a mesh network and use bitcoins to purchase bandwidth and pay the operators.  This would abstract the ISP and turning bandwidth into a fluid market of supply and demand.  All made possible by frictionless payments.
