Aha, this is what I was looking for! Thanks. Can you explain how public key crypto works and the difference between that and symmetric key crypto? Maybe through the interaction involved between a user and different parties as an example. This might help many of us to understand through layman terms.

Why do you say it would be a potential threat? What can they do anyways?

Interesting... Thanks for the reply.. It really is quite risky... But I cannot resist :3

20x return on your investment over the course of a year or so is very much something to scoff at. Especially when the price is being driven purely on speculation. I agree that this is a very risky way to diversify but I agree with you that it may be worth it to take the plunge with a little bit of money because if it were to boom I would reap some reward

hmm I really like your answer.. It truly is like nothing out there.. I like to compare it to gold when I am explaining it to someone but it true functionalities and behaviour is hardly like it. I would be very surprised if the US gov wasnt already interested... They hold more gold than any other nation and this is a relatively interesting new deflationary 'currency'... The question they might be asking is then; how stable is this? What would be more interesting would be to interview an expert that invests in bitcoin
