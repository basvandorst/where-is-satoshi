That is amazing. With google stopping ads word of mouth is how its going to happen
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:26:15
I completely agree. Trying to get the word out the best I can

they also changed crypto from being classified as a property, so no more property tax paying
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:29:33
Hahaha I think they might be the least populated state but that could soon change. I know companies are already moving in

Your right. I didn't know that. Had to look it up lol. 100k btc would be awesome

Hahahaha I have been there.

He actually said they are competing with Switzerland with this. All those questions are valid. Will be interesting to see what happens.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:57:56
I think you could be right
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:32:04
I completely agree and did this exact thing in the same time frame you did
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:21:19

@_date: 2018-04-21 01:55:00
yes it does. lets hope bull lol
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:28:40
That is there hope. They are already getting contacted by money companies. He just couldn't say anything about it yet
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:54:36
I have seen those charts, its crazy how close it is
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:55:13
hahahaha maybe
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:36:24
That is what I was worried about
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:18:23
there will be the federal gains tax, but he is right. state tax will be different in wyoming than anywhere else. i am looking at setting up an llc there for $50 to try and take advantage
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:25:28
It is more complicated. I just think people should at least take out initial investment if they get good returns or not just buy and forget
@_date: 2018-04-13 17:31:06
There is. I have a separate portfolio that I just hodl.
