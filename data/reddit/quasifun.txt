Yes.  You've named 4 of the brightest stars in tech.  If you were smarter than me, you could have made a bundle on AAPL and MSFT in the 80s and AMZN and GOOG in the 90s.  There are thousands of other tech stocks that didn't take off and either went under or were gobbled up by a competitor.

After working in tech and investing for so long, you are always thinking about the one that got away.  I was one of Netflix's first customers, back when their business was renting DVDs by mail for $4 each.   I could have bought into their IPO pretty easily.  It was priced at $15.  Split adjusted, it was under $1.  Now trading at $192.  The thing is, if I had bought at $1, I would have sold at $2 or $3.  Netflix was just a Blockbuster by mail, I had no idea it was going to get into streaming.  Back then, there was still a decent number of people on dialup in the US.

The problem with this logic is that you are buying stock in companies that have already gone public.  You're way past the VC stage where people make stupid money if the company breaks out.  By the time you buy the stock, lots of insiders and founders have already cashed out or are waiting out their lockup period.

I know, and I did.  The thing is, people who buy stocks cheap also sell them cheap.  I bought Apple at around $3/share, split adjusted, and sold for about $3.75.  25% return, who wouldn't want that?  This was in a time where all they sold were Macs.  I had no idea that smartphones would be invented or that everybody would own one.

Amazon is really unusual in that it is a large cap stock in an established business (retail) that also has really big gains.  It's really an outlier.  5 years ago I was not buying Amazon, because who buys high-priced stock in a low-growth sector?  Turns out I was dead wrong.  AWS blew up and led Amazon into being a tech company that also does retail.

If you're privately held, yes.  It is the easiest way for founders and early investors to liquidate their investment.  M&amp;A on a public company is going to score a premium on the trading price, generally 10-40%, but it's not stupid money.

You did make good money.  Selling was prudent.  You bought in the post-apocalyptic dot-com aftermath and probably remembered the beating that tech stocks took.

5 years ago it was on the line.  10 years ago it was definitely not a tech company.  It was a retailer.  It consumed lots of technology internally, of course - just like Wal-Mart, which incidentally also has a really awesome inward facing IT organization.
