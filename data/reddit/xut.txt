It's incredibly difficult to get your ad approved by insta or fb when you're doing anything crypto :(
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:21:39
Thanks for the tip... we're working on it
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:42:55
Yes that's the hope. I sense people do feel a little uptight with crypto transfers however, even if it's just to receive it (unless masked as an airdrop). Has a lot to do with not knowing what you don't know.   
Ultimately, I believe you and the rest of the folks on this board are right. Giveaways do seem to give off the wrong impression and the $3650 is better spent elsewhere. -- I'll likely run the promotion silently for a week just to keep it fair and then cut it off. Super thanks for the input.

Coinbase just bought a company that does this: Earn. It wasn't robust enough for our needs however. Perhaps there is room for more competitors in this space?
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:54:11
Noted. You're absolutely right. Will not do this promo again.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:47:07
I think you're right in that it gives off the wrong impression. Will look into your ideas; the prefunded lightening channels is interesting.

Just checked it out. Unfortunately we don't ever plan to issue a token nor do an ICO. Tokenized securities could be a welcome value add for most large cap companies with decent liquidity but the model isn't right for a start-up like ours.

Web app will be ready before Thanksgiving :)

This is true. I used to run a hobby music studio and had a tough time getting people to use it at $25/hour. I increased the rate to $70/hour and totally booked out lol. Will likely not do a giveaway again based on the input. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:38:10
lmao... this is quite genius actually
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:06:28
Love it. This is great feedback.   
I'll consider some ads on Reddit (if they get approved). Facebook hasn't been as kind. We've been focused mostly on product and have been growing slow and steady with quality users. Ultimately our goal is to offer way more in terms of value than one could ever consume. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:44:26
This is a great idea. That way you truly attract the people who are interested in the product instead of people being interested in a freebie. Will shape this into a future tactic. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:59:21
Good feedback... will look into reducing friction. Thank you
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:42:18
We’re at top 20 coins for now. We’ll add the rest once we work the kinks out on our first version. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:42:26
Thank you so much for the feedback. Lag is fixed as we upped on servers. We're monitoring crash reports and will have an update soon. I really want you to like it too. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:48:58
Hopefully it's good spam! Will implement some type of tipping on comments and posts in the near future. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:46:57
We'll have a source submission page soon. In the meantime,  r/coinfeed. And thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:09:59
Totally agree. Sort of a chicken and egg thing here. Need a community of votes before we can implemented. Good news is that we’re adding tabs that will let you filter by source type (in addition to a currency whitelist/blacklist) in mid-June. Appreciate the feedback. r/coinfeed 
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:13:06
Hi, thanks. Sent you a DM
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:45:14
All good! 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:38:50
Hey thanks. Not just for Reddit. We have over 100 sources right now. Reddit seems to take over because of the sheer number of posts each day. You'll be able to filter by source type very soon. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:44:46
Love this idea and would be easy to implement. Invite you to r/coinfeed for more feature requests. In the meantime have you seen this: [ 
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:38:21
Got it...I’ll add a way to quickly see ‘most engaged posts’ as a function of votes, comments, and clicks �� Thanks so much 
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:35:02
Do you mean curate feeds that others can follow or create a custom feed for yourself? 
If to curate for others, that’s an interesting idea. Traders and analysts would be able to sell their own alerts on here in the future. If there’s a strong demand to curate one’s own feed in addition, I’d consider building that out. Thanks

Lol yes. She's pregnant now. We can't confirm nor deny that we had anything to do with it. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 08:38:55
Does she? She seems to be impressed by things that sound smart even when her guests are completely wrong. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 08:37:49
Unfortunately, both of you are correct. She lacks expertise and yet she's still doing a better job than most :/

There’s a chance different inputs can create the same output (collisions) since there are less outputs than inputs.
