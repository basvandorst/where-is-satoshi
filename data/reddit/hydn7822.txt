you stand to gain from my information, i cannot gain anything from you by giving you said information. your argument is nonsensical. 
what you are hoping for is i am that naive , that i would just hand over such information. better luck next time tho.

scam artist, whos not asking for anything but advice? and back then the price was very low. do you even understand the definition of "scam"? 
whats so hard to believe , that people, years ago bought a relatively new thing, and either forgot about it or didnt think it would amount to much? 
you're a ignorant person, maybe dont bother replying.

So I could potentially have a lot of cash, hm. 
I mean its worth it I think just to feed my insane curious nature I suppose. Also, I started up bitcoin core, and it went from 7 yrs to 4 yrs within 30 mins. Maybe it wont take but a few days? Im just confused. 
Edit: Yes I have a pretty fast SSD.

anyway i am using a hdd recovery software on an old hdd i have to see if perhaps i can find any of the files mentioned. thanks again for anyone who offered assistance. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:10:05
Thank you for replying. 
Im not sure what is in it, thats one of the problems; I do not understand how to view the . wallet file , so I am sorry I cannot tell you if it contains a string of data. Sorry, worked all night last evening. 
All I am aware of, I'm pretty sure anyway, is it is related to BTC somehow... right? 
I also found a program called "Multibit". No idea how to use it, I am experimenting a bit. I mention that program because it asks for "wallet words", and I looked up examples of wallet words, and found a string of random words. (Hope you are following) Now, when I was looking through Facebook posts from around the time I got the BTC, I found some things I posted regarding BTC, and found  what I believe to be wallet words. So I try the words in Multibit,  but it does not allow me to click "next". 
Im just confused, hopefully Im making sense. Basically I am finding little clues, things related to BTC and its driving me insane. Not figuring things out gets me going a bit.

the moment you have the information, you could run off. its a simple as that. 
id not be taking anything from you, therefore you stand to gain i stand to lose. 
i came here simply for ideas on understanding what can be done with what i have, such as the .wallet file. as well as the ... seed words. 
Im done here tho, thanks anyway.

1. ok you need to stop making rude remarks and making presumptions. 
2. 5 years ago bitcoin was not worth what it is today , per coin. 
go use google and understand the basics before you start yapping.

there are no spaces no sir.

Sorry, I do not have a wallet.dat, I have a example.wallet , I am unsure exactly the difference and if its of any use. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:13:16
On Multibit it has a menu for "who created these wallet words", do I need to use the exact program I used to create them? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:37:13
this is what I found on Google about the *.wallet file
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:38:51
or handing something like that over a complete stranger. thanks but no thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:26:18
