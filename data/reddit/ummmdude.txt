I don't care about gold. Why don't you compare the dollar to platinum or any other mineral? I'm not to worried about the collapse of the dollar if that's what you're getting at here. I am certainly not a goldbug.

That's a pretty big question, I'll just stick to why I think it matters here. In this specific context I would have to say the the 'wrong' comes in where we are trusting the words of a person who uses racism/homophobia/doomsday fearmongering as a means to make a living. His newsletters are the workings of a person who is beyond delusional and should not be trusted on advice about complex matters such as crypto currencies. Best case scenario he was just trying to cash in on some racists and does not really believe any of things he's written for a solid decade of his life. If that is true then we still have someone who is just looking into to cash in on the next fad with no real important thing to add to the conversation. I don't think should be excited about the prospect of ron paul trying to cash in on this by bringing more doomsday conspiracies to the mix.

A checking account with interest is a better plan.

How is fiat weak and how does that correlate to the value of bitcoin? I value fiat because I can use it at places. I personally think regulations can be a good thing. It is a workable currency. Crypto currencies like bitcoin seem like ways to exchange something of value without anyone knowing about it. Which is a valuable thing, but is not valuable at all to me. 
Bitcoin appears to be a commodity, not a currency.

Those things actually provide value. Bitcoin seems like a crypto currency driven by hype.

The value is that more people will want to buy it so the value will be driven up so the value you have increases? Whereas the value microsoft stock comes from the goods and services they provide.

I just read your other post about being a general pro-racism arguer. I don't think this is the place for a discussion on the finer qualities of racism. For what it is worth, I think Lew Rockwell wrote them and Ron Paul thought it was just fine to make a buck off of neo-confederate cowards who ate up that delusional nonsense.

I don't like supporting openly racist liars even if they say something I agree with once and a while.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:36:50
That is hilariously naive.

How do you know that?


There appears to be no reason why bitcoin won't be $2k or 5$ tomorrow or next week. Just because it keeps hitting higher peaks over the course of a couple of years does not imply that the foundation is strong. It looks like another tech-style bubble.

His newsletters he wrote.

His race war stuff and the AIDs paranoia. The whole thing was a rag for dooms day preppers.
