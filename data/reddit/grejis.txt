This is going to allow buying and selling of literally anything, right?
There are already dark net markets where people buy and sell child pornography and others that hold murder lotteries. The human trafficking industry has a lot of capital running through it, so it doesn't seem like a stretch to think some of those folks will set up shop here too.
Will it be ironic to call it "free market" when they start selling child slaves on it? Or is there some way that this will be prevented from happening?

BTC China just disabled deposits: 
That would be why.

Here's proof it was:

I haven't figured that out myself. I did check that the names really matched though - I thought this was maybe some trick with Turkish i's or such.

Well, but to steal cash you generally have to commit some other sort of crime, like burglary or robbery, that generates a risk of being caught.
If you look at section 4.4 of [this paper]( the authors effectively prove that someone has stolen 59 Bitcoins from 158 different addresses when people (or software) mistakenly reused nonces. Those people lost their coins anonymously with no recourse. 
It's not clear if that's a crime, hence the topic.

It's the "virtual goods" part that makes it curious.
If you use bad crypto and I steal your Bitcoins is that more like me breaking into your house and stealing your cash (illegal) or more like me ganking you in a full-loot MMO and stealing the in-game stuff you bought with real money (legal)? Are Bitcoins more like dollars or EVE money where the law is concerned?

Bitcoin wallets have already been stolen in cases where someone used a non-cryptographically secure RNG to generate their ECC key pair and hence made their private key more easily guessable from their public key. See the "vulnerable signatures" section [here]( for a reference to back this up, if you like.
If you can crack ECC, you can derive private key from public, which means you can "steal" someone's coins if you know their public key.

I hadn't heard about that happening. Does anyone have a list of which countries BitCoin has been officially declared a currency?
