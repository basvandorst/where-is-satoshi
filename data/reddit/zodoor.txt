yes that's exactly what I'm saying. If you think someone could figure out you were doing that then just clear your clipboard. Btw you can put a shortcut on your desktop to clear it with one click(google) or you could make your password a couple of words short and delete them real quick after pasting or or or or meh... you should always be using 2 faCTOr like google authentication as well.

All I can say is I love last pass and have been using it for about 4 years. I haven't used anything else to compare it to so take it with a grain of encrypted salt. Btw for my master pass I have a licence agreement txt file on my desktop and I use an entire paragraph out of it for my password , so when I log in I just copy and paste and last pass logs me into the rest of the world.

Learn from ignorance, A long long time ago when bitcoin was  I bought one bitcoin and then put it on GDAX and began day trading it , I never lost money(usd) but I missed(called) most of the big run ups and dips . So now I have $7150 or .4 btc, not bad for a couple of months but If I would have left it alone I'd still have 1 btc or $19500 usd. And to that point when I was moving btc around I left $100usd on my phone(bitpay) and now it's up to $488 I think it's been around 90 days not sure.

Well I am one person, maybe not an average person but a person non the less and here is what I have been doing. I had a little disposable income 2 years ago and began buying and holding physical silver and gold as I began hearing about cryptos and the crazy returns on them I stopped buying metals and began buying cryptos. Now if I ever made large returns on my cryptos I would be looking for something I could actually hold that couldn't be hacked or regulated to death and would probably put 25 percent into metals again for long term safety. I have less than 10,000 of all the above so i'm sure my actions and thinking are much different than that of institutions and countrys that can actually move markets.
 I think the only way cryptos really affect gold would be if cryptos began overtaking the dollar moving it down which in turn affects the price of gold.

Should I put my peanut butter on one piece of bread and then the jelly on that or the jelly on it's own individual piece and then marry the two ? and on the same note should I then immediately eat the delicious sandwich or just gently wedge it vertically between my butt checks thus gradually warming said sandwich for later enjoyment?

Also my thinking at the time was I want a way to bail out quickly if the shit hit's the fan but greed meets stupidity got the best of me .

So did you buy it through bitpay?or are you using bitpay as your wallet and if so who did you buy the coin from? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:56:53
That falls a bit short of my prediction of $20,420

 I might as well be reading this in Spanish, so help me out. Last week I bought $500 worth of bitcoin from coinbase(awful experience) then transferred it to my Bitpay wallet on my phone where it is now, In engrish, should I worry?  
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:13:22
Well at least something good came out of this threaD. Thanks brah

I've been waiting for 2 weeks now to have my bank account validated with no help from support, I was able to get my credit card validated within minutes however the fees are way to high for that. just google "coinbase validation problem" and see I'm not alone. If I can't get my bank account validate then they are useless (to me). I did buy a small amount of BtC with my credit card and transferred to my wallet to see the process and though a bit of pain and a learning curve it's not that bad and looking at other sites it may be the easiest out there but again if they can't validate or respond to any issues you may have then I'd proceed with caution.

Going to war with the Clinton has proven to be a very dangerous game. people seem to become rapidly depressed and kill themselves (probably due to extreme guilt of wrongly accusing them of something or other). I'm short Assange.

I'm a complete idiot what does this mean and how can I make 1.2 million dollars in less than 4 hours. But seriously does it mean if and  when the price hits 4100 people are ''auto buying''?
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:24:42
I signed up for coinbase first (semi pain in the ass) but then it was a breeze for gdax, might try that avenue. btw I could never get coinbase to confirm my regular (local) bank account but they did confirm my  capital one checking account so I had to transfer to capone and then to gdax. The whole thing took a couple of weeks. This my friends is what is holding bitcoin back,among other things of course.. I can open a pay-pal account and be using it to buy thousands of dollars worth of crap the next day so a normal person(like my lovely mother) should be able to do the same with btc, as it is there is no way my mom,dad,brother, and most of my moron friends could or would ever take the time to figure all this b.s.out
