Social networks do not have the same opportunity cost associated with them that holding a currency does.  
If you store your $X of your value in Dogecoin, that is necessarily $X less that you can store in Bitcoin.  It might make sense to have G+, FB, and Linkedin, but currencies compete in such a way that there can only be one at the end.

As far as I can tell, the non-monetary aspects of a currency are a distraction--a negative not a plus.  I don't really understand what Etherum offers that Bitcoin does not that is that compelling with respect to monetary properties, but if Etherum were to grow to the size of Bitcoin, I think it would then have superior monetary properties.  The basic idea is the largest currency has huge advantages over the others.
Litecoin has continued to exist as have other alts, but the question we must ask is what do they offer to the marketplace?  What can they do that Bitcoin cannot do better?  If the answer is nothing and they have no utility then they must collapse.  If Bitcoin is a superior currency to ETH, then why would anyone hold ETH when Bitcoin is superior?  The currencies will compete until one is driven into negligible liquidity and will then be useless..

The same reason one currency will eventually emerge to dominate the marketplace of money.  A currency that has a high market cap has high liquidity and many network effect advantages.  This is why Bitcoin is valuable but clones of bitcoin are not.
Long term I expect Bitcoin to continue to grow against the alts because of the network advantages, but if an alt were to serge past BTC's market cap it would have advantages over BTC.  As such, it is a risk.

There are a lot of people who perpetuate this idea that there is "price manipulation" by "the big boys", who are of course never defined.  The idea is that the price is controlled by others, but the reality is prices are set by two parties who want to transact with each other.  It shouldn't really matter to you if you are not part of the transaction.
The reason people do this is they like to have some mysterious force (manipulation) for their misfortune and why their investments consistently under perform the market rather than looking at the real cause--themselves.
No one is pumping or manipulating (or rather more accurately if they do it has no effect).  And furthermore, even if someone were to pump up and investment and sell it to some dumbass so what?  The ultimate value of something is going to be independent of someone getting duped

I'm not sure if we agree or not.  I am saying the only reason anyone accepts dollars **at all** is to store value AND that the only reason they have any value is because someone is willing to hold them.  I am not saying dollars are a good store of value over the long term, but if people were not willing to then the dollar would have no value whatsoever and would not be accepted anywhere.  Is is the horders of any currency that give it demand/value.
It makes no difference if the dollar sits in the wallets of 365 different people each day of the year or if it is stored in some dude's bank valued.  For the purposes of economic demand, these two situations are identically, people or a person are willing to hold one dollar for 365 days.


"The very near future" is a non-zero amount of time, and the amount of time an individual dollar stays in your wallet is unimportant.  What is relevant is that you keep for example on average $5k in us dollars for convenience, that is how much demand you are generating for dollars.  It's the economic equivalent as if you hold that same $5k indefinitely.   Other entities are willing to keep different amounts of cash on hand in dollars e.g. corperations/banks/etc, but it is their willingness to hold a currency that gives it demand.


Because the entire purpose of currency is to store value.  The only reason USDs are easier to transact than Bitcoin is because of size, which we can rationally conclude will shift to Bitcoin's favor over time.  And also because we can recognize the logical outcome of currencies competing against one another in an open market.  As Bitcoin becomes more popular those holding USD will pay more and more of an opportunity cost for doing so, leading them to dump their dollars in favor of the superior currency.  It will also lead to speculative attacks against the dollar whereby people borrow USD to buy and hold Bitcoin.  This kills the dollar.

Why is it obvious there would be a big drop
@_date: 2016-04-12 22:21:05


It would be zero.  Have you by chance read any of the articles on the nakamoto institute?  They have some really good ones about how the orders of bitcoins are the ones giving it value and are the ultimate key to its success.  Their work is great if you like economic theory and thinking about the nature of money.


presumably at some point you traded some good or service for all the currency you have.  These transactions express your demand to the market economy as a whole.  Suppose you at some time later the market comes to you and offers you $400 for your Bitcoin, by continuing to hold it you provide demand for Bitcoin.  If that value dropped and the market were only offering you $1 for the Bitcoin, you would be supplying less demand by holding it at $1.  In reality total demand is the aggregate sum of the demand of all market participants.  Currency is interesting in that it is one of the rare things that becomes more useful the higher the price.  The higher the demand for a currency, the higher it's liquidity.  If enough people demand Bitcoin it becomes more useful, which is what we have seen as it has grown since inception.  Conversely when a currency declines in value (some people would call this market cap) it starts to lose utility.  As you can see this creates a situation that is very favorable to feedback, which is why when we see a currency collapse it tends to do so rapidly.
For me it is easiest to think of currencies as a giant sheet stretched out into a plane, with several weights placed on it.  The more weights there are, the more resistant the sheet is to distorting when another weight is added or removed.  If all the weights were removed, there would be no tension left in the sheet and it would collapse, or would greatly distort shape when small weights enter or exit the sheet.

a party who has the currency and is willing to exchange it for a certain amount of goods, services, or another currency
a counterparty who wants that currency and is willing to exchange a certain amount of goods, services, or another currency for it.
These are the same thing, economically speaking.


I don't think you need the actual exchange to take place.  Someone holding 1 bitcoin when offered $400 for it is effectively the same as someone buying 1 bitcoin for $400.


By hording you are accepting Bitcoin in exchange for -other stuff- on a continual basis.  Each second you hold a Bitcoin you are creating demand by effectively exchanging the continued ownership of that Bitcoin for the goods/services you could otherwise have by not hording it.


I would argue that unlike commodities (which have an end use) rising prices increases demand for currency, because the rising price makes the currency more useful.

The only reason anyone has to *ever* hold a dollar or any other form of currency is to store value--though in some cases, it is for a limited amount of time.  The reason people are more willing to lend &amp; invest vs store their value in USD/gold is because USD &amp; gold are shitty stores of value over the long term.  Bitcoin is far superior in this aspect, and as such we can expect more people to store their value with Bitcoin as it becomes the dominate currency.  Once it does, people will only lend or invest if their expected risk-adjusted ROI is higher than holding the Bitcoin directly.  In effect, it will make our entire economy more efficient by cutting down on malinvestment.


This only raises the question as to why the people accepting the dollar wants it.  If you sum up all the hold times for a dollar, it is held forever, because someone wants to hold it, if people didn't then the dollar would not be accepted because no one would want it.


Or perhaps they see a future where there is a better economy arises from a currency created outside of the existing monetary system.

That is the exact same thing, you doofus.  Someone who buys a gold bar also does so to store their value *until they exchange it for goods and services*.  You seem to think it matters how long the person holds it before they exchange it, but this is irrelevant as the dollar/gold/seashell/etc must then be held by someone else willing to hold it.  
There can be no spending of bitcoins without the buying of them, and thus all use of bitcoins as a medium of exchange depend on someone who wants to increase his holdings, i.e., a hoarder. Without them there could literally be no Bitcoin trade.  This is true for any currency.  
Another way to think of this is if there were not people who wanted to hold dollars long term, then the entire currency would collapse.  Or that at any one instant 100% of dollars are held, the length of time they have been held by one person is irrelevant--they have all been held for the entirety of their existence.

Hyperbitcoinization will surely be disruptive, but not all disruption is bad.  The longer this process takes the more death and suffering there will be as a result of malinvestment and government doing what government does (war/prison industrial complex/etc).
That said I have a hard time feeling a lot of sympathy for the collateral suffering that will fall on people.   I expect the amount of suffering to be proportional to how much of one's wealth is tied up in USD--that is, I would expect the rich who maintain their wealth in dollars, bond, and rent-seeking instruments will suffer the most--and I say good, because the evil that governments do is only possible because people are choosing to hold USD  Without people willing to hold dollars, there is no funding available to governments beyond debt and taxes.
In a way, if you hold USD, you kind of deserve what you get.

Seignoirage and the other shenanigans of central banks are mass theft (though now it is done against people who willingly choose to hold US dollars).
We know this will end as it always does--with 100% of the value of the currency being siphoned away via seignoirage.  I think it is *better* for this failure to occur sooner rather than later, as a slow bleed is much more harmful than a sudden currency collapse followed by a shift to an non-inflationary money.
A more rapid expansion of the monetary supply will bring about a sooner resolution, and by extension a sooner recovery, and a better world for everyone.

Here is a great article about how hyperbitcoinization should be much different than a normal hyperinflation event, and how it should be accompanied by a great increase in productivity and efficiency.  Of course as with any major disruption there will be many who suffer, but taken as a whole, I think it should be a net reduction in suffering.

if dollars suddenly each became worth more, this would effectively have NO inflationary effect as the value of each individual unit would stay the same (though not in nominal terms).
It is only by the addition of new units in a asymmetrical manner that inflation occurs and benefits those who receive the newly created money.

Ver was working to promote and perhaps more importantly invest in Bitcoin before AA even got on board.  I like AA, but if you recall the recent post you see how irresponsible he was with his own personal fiances.  If AA had just invested in BTC heavily then he would be a multi millionaire right now and that would be better for himself and for BTC.
I am sad to see Ver go off on his own Bcash thing, but even that helps bitcoin as it has shown resistance to forks and the price increase reflects that newfound immunity.

You really are a condescending jackass you know that?
I am fully aware of how cash settled futures work buy here's the thing, money is fungible so it doesn't matter the particular Avenue of settlement as it relates to cost.  If you short bitcoin with a cash settled future your cost to settle is the same as it would be with actual delivery.  Same for oil or bushels of wheat.
The difference is if the price of oil spiked super high it is easier to find alternates.  In economic turns a price spike brings on additional supply which dampens the price surge.  With bitcoin this doesn't happen.  Of course you don't have to deliver an actual bitcoin but your settlement cost will be the same as if you did.
Another problem this causes is there may be a substantial amount of bitcoin shorted in excess what would be if they were settled due to actual delivery, so when the market hits a supply crunch, the cost to settle in cash will exceed the solvency of many shorts

You joke but the key commonality of bubbles and the reason they pop is because an asset grows in value to where there are tremendous incentives to increase supply....and so supply get increased cause the bible to crash.  This is exactly what is happening with the US dollar and exactly why this cannot happen with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:19:18
Markets are not stable so why should you expect a currency--which is just a system of accounting that reflects underlying economic conditions to be stable.
We don't live in a stable world so we need a currency that can easily and quickly adapt to signals in the market.  The fact that we have a "stable currency" is an indication that government is acting against market forces to create an artifical stability.  One example of this is the Fed paying banks to sit on reserves after the 2008 shitshow.
The problem with such "stability" is it is stable until it is not.  Most people consider the US dollar a safe and stable investment; quite frankly it scares the hell out of me, or would if I owned a lot of dollars or bonds.

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:27:36
In situations like this, where you are uncertain on two competing explanations for market phenomena, it helps to look at historic examples and see which one fits better.
The common economic view of bubbles is they pop because demand goes away, but IMO this is overly simplistic.  As is the case with every bubble, and if you just think it through you know that a rise in price in any good/asset is going to incentivize additional production.  I cannot think of a single instance when this is not the case.  Housing, Gold, Baseball cards, Tulips, Art, Beanie babies, etc.  So there is an initial supply scarcity that spikes price before the leadtime for newly created supply in response gets to market.  When this increased supply floods into the market it exceeds demand and price falls, which THEN causes a drop in demand creating a vicious cycle.  
The other explanation doesn't make sense.  People don't just lose demand for a good/service.  You have to look to what happens to supply during a bubble.  Suppose the housing bubble had occurred in a world where it was strictly impossible for new houses to be created, or the silver bubble of the 80s in a world where you could not mine for more.  That is what is different about Bitcoin that no one else sees and why it can't be a bubble.  Bubbles by their very nature of increased prices trigger a supply expansion but there can be no such expansion with bitcoin.  The market is trying to fill this demand for more bitcoin with goofy clones, but like bad Elvis impersonators, they can't compare with the original because they offer no utility to the market that is not met cheaper and better by Bitcoin.

Imagine if it were not possible to build new housing.  If this were the case, housing prices would have continued to rise.

You are incorrect and are modeling inflation incorrectly.
The supply of Bitcoin is 21M minus permanently lost coins.  Suppose someone took a lot of dollars threw them down a well on a property that is schedule to have the well dug up in a year.  Would you consider the supply of dollars to have decreased?
The supply of bitcoins is fixed it is just some are not yet claimed.  Inflation makes no sense as a useful metric unless it looks at total supply including units that exist but are inaccessible until a future date.  
If you are still not getting this, consider if there were an asteroid of pure gold that was scheduled to fly by earth and break apart showering our planet with a substantial amount 5 years from now.  When would the market price adjust to this inflation--when the event is known about, or when the gold actually lands--or still later when it is harvested and turned into coins?

@_date: 2018-09-06 01:21:26
The question you should be asking is what kind of advantage a deflationary currency offers an individual.  From there you can scale up those benefits to a society at large.
Consider what inflation really is.  Note that you cannot have inflation without an inflator.  That is, if you had a small economy with 1000 dollars with 5% inflation, those dollars would not all grow into 1.05 dollars over the course of a year.  What would happen is that 50 new dollars would be created and someone would get the benefit of those dollars--usually a central bank or those economically closest to the new money.
This is a distortion of the accounting ledger (currency) the society is using and introduces inefficiencies into the system.  Suppose in that hypothetical example the members of the society had the opportunity to opt out of the inflationary currency and use one that does not expand--each of their percentage ownership/control over the money supply would be fixed and protected from the dilution of the would be new currency units.

Open did not atlrticulate thus well.
When there is a bubble it does not pop because some wall Street villain tricks people into selling.  Bubbles pop because they signal to the market to produce more of that underlying asset.  If gold spikes people increase mining efforts, if housing spikes people build more housing supply.
If bitcoin spikes there ain't shit you can do.  You can create synthetic supply with a secondary futures market where people can short but this is 100% certian to end in a liquidity crunch for somone on on the short side of the transaction.

I would like you to consider that you are not certian of your current value or debt.
If the US dollar declines in value, your value will decline  ( you could expect house values to fall if financing becomes more expensive) and your debt in dollars would have declined in value as well.

It is a validation of my monetary thesis that alt coins are superfluous and add no value to the market.  Also,  the higher the BTC dominance is the higher the network effect advantage it has over other competitors.  If Litecoin had a higher market cap &amp; liquidity than Bitcoin, I would consider this to be a very serious threat to Bitcoin's dominance.
Basically if Bitcoin can be overtaken by XYZ-coin, there is no assurance that XYZ-coin would not be overtaken by VYZ-coin, and as such, it could never have as much value as Bitcoin does now

Real Estate like gold and many other investment vehicles have a monetary value and a non monetary value (utility value).
Many people buy real estate as a store of value.  If a non inflationairy currency exists we can expect people would value the monetary aspect of real estate less (eventually zero) and real estate (and gold) will then fall in price to their utility value.
Basically an inflationary currency makes real estate inflated.  Note that you see people move into real estate in countries when inflation starts to rise

No it doesn't.  The supply is fixed at 21 M.  Some of those unclaimed coins become claimed with each block, but the supply does not increase.  If you model in this way, you will come to all sorts of wrong conclusions.  Monetary supply, by any useful definition must include the forward looking "unclaimed' supply because if it doesn't it is useless for economic analysis.  Since Bitcoin's future supply is known and fixed it is not inflationary.
I understand what you are trying to say, but you need to think deeper about the existing supply and how it does include currently known but unclaimed supply.

This is because Altcoins have lower liquidity so it takes much less capital flow to move their prices.  Ultimately I do not see any alt coin as offering anything of value to the market--e.g. none of them do anything of significant value that Bitcoin cannot do better and more securely. 
If we think this through to its logical conclusion you will see the only possible outcome with the value of all altcoin and indeed ALL NON-BITCOIN CURRENCY (USD/EUR/Gold/Etc.), going to zero.

the downside is it does not quickly adjust to reflect the market's signals.
There are legitimate reasons why prices fluctuate and a currency that is able to match that fluctuation is better than one that is artificially stabilized through central planning. 
One example would be how anti-price gouging laws prohibit people from charging extreme prices in a disaster for things like food/water, but when these prices go up, the market will rush to fill this demand by sending trucks of supplies.  
You dont need a stable currency, you need a currency that accurately reflects market conditions &amp; signaling.

Bitcoin is not the bubble, it's the pin.
It is nice to see someone who understands economics here but I do draw a different conclusion than you.  When bitcoin causes the value of the dollar to drop it will shift economic power and make the economy much more efficient-- currently about 7% of gdp is tied up in the finance sector so eliminating all that waste will be a boon for everyone.
Also with a deflationary currency consumption is appropriately discouraged and saving is rewarded.  You better buy some sunglasses because the economic future is bright AF

I am by no means an expert with respect to the technical aspects of Bitcoin, but my understanding is that there is a direct coloration between the amount of data someone wants to put on the blockchain and the accompanying fee.  If people were to start to do this, fees would increase and the market would reach equilibrium.
That said, for mere storage of data the cost to throw something on a cloud server or to a thumb drive is pretty low, so I don't see people choosing the blockchain as an good place to store bulk data.

For you as an individual, would it be more beneficial to hold a deflationary currency or an inflationary one?


I can either own a home/assets or a currency.  They are mutually exclusive for each unit.  If I am a holder of the currency then I would want to own a deflationary one.  if I am an owner of a house I am effectively shorting the currency \*(understand opportunity cost or this is not going to make sense to you)\*  Clearly if I have chosen to buy assets with my currency it would be better if that currency were inflationary.  For the holder of that currency, it is better if it is deflationary.


I do not think there has ever been one.  Let's be clear that I am talking about monetary deflation and not price deflation, which I consider to be a bullshit term that causes more confusion--which I believe is intentional.


In real or nominal terms?  This is already the case in real terms.  Why does nominal matter?  There are instances now where companies squeeze suppliers for items when the market allows.  I do not see falling nominal wages as a problem \*especially\* if real wages are rising at the same time.


What you are talking about is price deflation.  Correlation does not equal causality.  Consider that in times of uncertainty people try to horde cash as a mechanism of dealing with the uncertainty.  People are also in situations where they have to liquidate their assets.  Both of these drive prices down, which is often called --and I hate this term, price deflation.  It is just a natural market reaction to slowdown and hardship--really the slow down is necessary because without it, more resources would continue to be wasted until there is a catastrophic failure. 
One example of price deflation that did not correlate with an economic hardship is technology goods which have declined greatly in price for quite some time.

@_date: 2018-08-16 19:58:34
Many!  First off you should understand that you cannot have inflation without an inflator.  That is, money does not just grow uniformly the way the universe expands.   Monetary expansion occurs by the creation of new currency units that benefit whatever entities are closest to this new money.  In the situation we have now, this expansion benefits banks and people who have access to cheap credit, as well as people who owe money (see government).  
Economic benefits like this must necessarily come at the expense of other actors in the economy.  If you need me to expand on this point I can.
But the real benefit is from shifting the time preference of economic behavior.  Imagine you have a money that loses value rapidly over time.  You would have a HIGH TIME PREFERENCE in that you would have an incentive to consume now or to invest.
Now suppose you have a deflationary money.  You would then have a LOW TIME PREFERENCE (it can never be zero, and I can explain why if you need me to).  You would prefer to consume less in the present for the benefit of being able to consume more in the future.   You would also require your investments to be of higher quality--that is, an investment that may produce 1-2% gain in an inflationary currency would not be sufficient in a deflationary one.  That is only investments that appear productive on a risk-adjusted basis would be worthy of capital.
TLDR: Inflation encourages wasteful economic activity such as consumption and shitty investments.  Deflation severely punishes wasteful economic activity and unnecessary consumption.   With a deflationary currency, people have to make sure whatever they are spending their money on is worthwhile.

Unless they go for below market, which would be the case if there were not enough demand, as this would create an arbitrage opportunity.  It is simple supply and demand, and we are about to have a supply increase of 100k coins, if demand stays constant, we can expect a decline in price, obviously

Money is a naturally monopolistic market.  A currency cannot exist in equilibrium with another currency.  If you understand money correctly you would conclude that bitcoin will inevitably eat ALL other currency competitors due to the high opportunity cost one incurs from not owning Bitcoin.

It doesn't matter what people want OTHER people to do.  People are going to act in their best interest--it matters what individuals themselves want to do. 
The way you measure economic growth is problematic.  If people consume more you would consider this to be economic growth because GDP would increase.  Not all economic activity is productive and in fact much economic activity is destructive.
It is probably correct that deflation would reduce GDP and economic activity, but the quality of that economic activity would shift from consumption/bad investments to deferred consumption and productive investments.
You also need to understand that when individuals hoard money they are providing a very valuable benefit to the economy as a whole.  Inflation provides disincentives for people to hoard money, which is quite harmful to the economy.

I understand many people share the view you express here--that money sitting idle on a ledger is not doing anything for anyone or providing real benefit to the economy.
This pervasive view frustrates me beyond what you could imagine because it is ignorant and dangerously wrong.  I usually respond with dismissive hostility to people who spew this nonsense, but you seem like a decent person so I will try to articulate why this is very wrong.
I assume you have insurance.  The reason you have insurance is if your house burns down you would be in a bad situation without it.  Now imagine you have $500k in cash sitting in your secure vault.  Suddenly you would find that the need for insurance is not quite as great as you would be able to better handle an unexpected disruptive event such as your house burning down.
Similarly, you can extend this thinking to a corporation that has a large amount of unencumbered cash reserves.  Suppose such a company were hit with an unexpected disruption or economic shock.  Would they be better positioned to absorb this financial damage than a company that is "fully invested" by having it's excess capital loaned out?
We can further expand this thinking to consider whole economies where there are many people holding ample amounts of cash vs one that does not.  In the event assets start falling in value or the cash that was loaned out is suddenly defaulted en mass, it is the holders of cash who step in and absorb the damage of this unexpected economic disruption by buying up distressed assets.
That is the true value of money sitting idle--it provides the economy with much more resilience to unexpected disruption and allows people/companies/and even whole economies to take advantage of sudden investment opportunities.  Consider how restricted you (or your economy) would be if your capital were fully committed--you would have asset prices fall....and fall....and fall.  In a situation where there are adequate savers with idle cash, such disruptions are greatly mitigated.
This is because an idle currency provides you with a very valuable tool--the ability to remain agnostic and unencumbered and when you do, you signal the rest of the market which reacts accordingly and resources held back for the unexpected shock...which will inevitably come.

They do not understand Gresham's Law or much less Thiers' Law.  People don't understand what the fuck money is, what it's purpose is, or what properties make for good money. Yet they spew their nonsense with supreme arrogance.  
Many times I have said anyone who spends Bitcoin either doesn't fully understand the situation or is a fucking idiot, because Bitcoin is far too valuable to spend as long as people are willing to accept US Dollars (or really any non-Bitcoin currency) instead.  Eventually Bitcoin will become the only currency that is spent, because no one will accept anything else.
Another thing people like to repeat that is backasswards wrong is that people who hoard cash are not providing a real and active benefit to themselves and the economy as a whole.

As an individual why would you care who owns the rest of the currency?  I can understand why you would oppose owning it if a small group of people had control over the supply and could expand or create more of it thereby decreasing the % of the total supply you own, but in Bitcoin that is not possible.  It is possible in fiat.

A currency's success is best measured by its price.  Currencies are valuable because people want them e.g. demand.  If you want Dogecoin to succeed, it is *critical* that it have *more* demand than any other currency like it.

This may seem irrational right up until the point you look outside your window and see a ton of dead birds and a river of blood.  I will argue the money in an FDIC insured accounts is substantially MORE risky.
First you need to breakdown and specify the different types of risk.  In some areas, the FDIC option is probably less risky, but in many important vectors of risk, it is far MORE risky.  First there is risk that your FDIC-insured money can be seized or frozen.  This can happen if you are accused of a crime, have a judgement entered against you from a civil case, targeted by the government WITHOUT being convicted of a crime, or divorced.  These are all very real risks to your money, even though im sure you will dismiss them as illegitimate.
But none of those are the real danger i see.   Your FDIC money is dependent on the underlying value of the currency.  Your nominal $250k you have in your FDIC account is insured but there is no insurance that the $250k will have the same value it does today. The underlying currency can simply go to zero.  There are many factors which affect the value of a currency, but one VERY important one is money supply.  I would even go so far as to say I cannot think of a currency collapse that did not occur alongside a monetary expansion.  
Time and time again governments have controlled money and for some reason it seems all these currencies seem to meet the same untimely end.  I'm sure you think this is not a legitimate risk, but consider that every holder of every fallen currency felt their currency was "safe and sound".  It's more like defending the construction of a doomsday shelter when the apocalypse occurs with predictable regularity.   Bitcoin has much less (zero) risk of monetary expansion.


Have you ever heard the term moral hazard?  If banks were responsible for lending, we wouldn't need FDIC or bailouts.  Currently banks have a perverse incentive to lend irresponsibly.  If they take outsized risks and win they get to keep the profit, if they fail their losses are socialized.  In a free market, rates are set by the market--and those that DO have the expertise and willingness to extend credit responsibly, grow in economic power whilst those that do not, wane economically.
And you are still not listening to me about funds sitting under the allegorical pillow--THOSE FUNDS DO CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE ECONOMY.  It is savings (and by this I mean hoarded currency--e.g. under a pillow), that allows an economy to grow and absorb damage.  When you use central planning to reduce savings below what they would otherwise be, your economy is more at risk to shock and less able to take advantage of good investment opportunities when they arise.  The housing crisis is one such example of how this can end badly.
Just to emphasis--saving capital under a pillow is probably doing more to allow for economic growth than money in an FDIC insured bank or loaned out at artificially low interest rates.  Until you understand how much benefit the cash hoarders provide to an economy, you are not going to understand this.

Before Bitcoin I had a short term bearish view on fiat.
What I mean by this, is after the 2008 recession and subsequent bailout, that greatly expanded the monetary supply, I expect the value of fiat to fall greatly in the short term.  This has not happened yet, for various reasons, but certainly will.
Without Bitcoin, fiat would collapse and some other currencies would become temporarily favored, perhaps gold or some other fiat, but fiat (in a different form) would win the market war against gold and things would go on as they always have.
With Bitcoin I am long term bearish on dollars, fiat, and even gold, because I realize none of those things can exist in equilibrium with Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin kills all other companies.  It is like being slightly bearish on Blockbuster, but then you find out Netflix exists, and realize the severity and permanence of the coming fiat collapse.

@_date: 2014-04-12 18:27:47


The point is people *still* spend money when they absolutely could have 5% more buying power if they were to wait a year.


Let's look at this with a thought experiment.  Suppose I have $50 billion dollars and I pay 50,000 people a million dollars to draw portraits of me for a year.  Is the economy better because of this?  GDP went up, but what of the opportunity cost that these people could have been producing something else of value?


Well, that is because we spend so many resources consuming shit we don't actually need or *really* want.  And it would absolutely be enough to provide everything people need or *really* want...you know, by definition.

Well it is a fundamental characteristic of your monetary system, but not mine.  The Bitcoin economy--the economy I choose to store my value in, does not have this characteristic, which is one of the reasons it is vastly superior to your money.

We live in a dynamic world with a dynamic economy.  With variables changing constantly it is reasonable that predictions will change.  The degree to which they change and the magnitude of that change can be resistant to variable change to varying degrees.
Long term I think I can accurately predict the price of bitcoin with high accuracy and can from there back out a reasonable estimate of the price in the mid term with less precision.  If the market conditions change such that price drops 60% then my mid term estimations may be necessary to revise, but the long term analysis can still remaining in tact and sound.

Actually, I don't think bitcoin is inflating at all.  As economists, we should model bitcoin as if all bitcoins exist, but some are not yet claimed, this is very very different than the inflation that occurs with national currencies. 
That said, dropping 100k coins on the market is going to have an impact on price, because previously horded bitcoins are now released onto the market
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:10:48

I am in a position where I do not need the money in the short term.  My job provides me enough to cover my day-to-day expenses.
As to Bitcoin, I do not feel it is risky because I know with an extremely high degree of confidence that Bitcoin has long-term viability and will unseat the USD.  I did a FMA (Failure mode analysis on it), and I see Bitcoin as extremely safe.  I have always been very interested in economics, my whole life I have thought about money, what it is, what function it serves, and what would be the prefect money.  While I heard about Bitcoin in 2011, I didn't look into it, dismissing it as Flooz 2.0
In August I heard about Bitcoin on NPR.  By mid Oct. I was fully invested.  It just makes sense to me on a fundamental level.  To me, this is just the way it is.  Of course if I am wrong I will be utterly devastated, but I did not feel nervous about this move when I made it, and I certainly don't feel that way now.
After the huge run up I actually did look for alternatives to Bitcoin to diversify--while BTC is secure against every scenario I can conceive of, there are potentially unknown risks.  So I looked at gold (which I think has no value whatsoever now that BTC exists), dollars (which I think are worthless) stocks (companies whose earnings are completely dependent on the value of the USD), and real estate.  I do want to buy at least one rental property so that if BTC does hit an unseen wall I will be okay, but I have not yet found a property.  Also, I cant buy one until I build up enough cash as selling BTC would create a tax liability for me.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:08:17
If gold were easily divisible, transportable, secure, and couldn't be faked, it would be spent just like dollars.

I am a "Bitcoin Minimalist" because I have diligently searched for areas where some altcoin might compete against Bitcoin, or mechanisms of attack that would cause bitcoin to have lower utility than whatever-coin dejure is popular at the time.
It is only because of this open mindedness that I have become a hardcore Bitcoin maximalist with absolute confidence that not only can no coin hope to overtake or even compete with Bitcoin, but that Bitcoin does everything better than all other wannabe bitcoin impersonators.  If you do not conclude the same, you are either ignorant of monetary economics or stupid.

A man is ultimately responsible for his own success.  If a man older than 25 is standing in line waiting to cash his check at the Wal-mart Money Center he has failed in his life.  He brings nothing of value to society, or himself beyond a de minimus measure...whatever manual-labor based job he does that allows him to live paycheck to pay check buying food and renting a sad little home.
Not every person is blessed with my talents, but I do believe that every person has enough talent that, if good decisions are made, will allow them to live a comfortable life.  People who fail to obtain this are a blight on our society as their self-destructive decisions destroy capital and oppress the rest of us (usually through voting some jackass who has manipulated them by opposing gay marriage or abortion, or some other meaningless bullshit).
Fuck these people.  They deserve to be poor and they deserve to suffer.  If we lived back in primitive times, these were the fuckers that act as a burden on society by draining its resources.

The governmental regulations did not prevent people from getting scammed either.  The free market does not prevent people from getting scammed.  Part of being free is the ability to do foolish things.
As for no recourse, the recourse in a free market is damage to one's reputation.  Scammers get identified as such, while trustworthy businesses gain a reputation advantage.
But it doesn't really matter what you think.  Bitcoin has come to destroy all governments and bring about the libertarian utopia of my dreams.  This is inevitable and you will have no choice in the matter.  Your ability to oppress other people via government thugs is coming to an end very soon.

This is correct.   However, hording is not my concern.  Hording does increase liquidity.
My concern is coins that are lost forever.  There aren't actually 13.5 M coins, there are more like 10 million, as a good number of private keys have been forever lost.  I think the best measure of Bitcoin's success is its liquidity which is measured by price (market cap).
The larger the market cap, the larger the amount of money that can be moved across the network without price distortion.  The market cap appears to be ~$5 billion, but if 20% of those coins are forever lost, then the real market cap actually $4 billion.
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:46:06

You are correct that Doge is valuable because people buy it and hold it, but to what end?  Doge has less liquidity than Bitcoin, and less infrastructure around it, so therefore it is inherently worth less than bitcoin.  This creates a feedback loop which will destroy all non-bitcoin money.

I was a national delegate for Dr. Paul.  When we were crushed by the RNC in Tampa I felt a tremendous sense of dread as the monetary collapse seemed inevitable.  A year later I discovered Bitcoin and I feel a sense of hopeful optimism again.
The monetary collapse is still imminent, but we are safe.

@_date: 2014-04-17 17:39:17
It is true that a smaller monetary base allows for someone to have a greater effect on the market price. 
I strongly believe that it is impossible for someone to take advantage of this.  Suppose someone has a large amount of bitcoin, and wants to accumulate even more.  Suppose they sell X Btc dropping the price. 
Then what?  If they try to buy back their X Btc, they will cause the reverse to occur and drive the price up.  More importantly (in this overly simplistic example) they will be buying bitcoin at a higher price than they sold it (unless the buyer actually sells the coins he just bought for *less* than he *just* bought them for).
Small liquidity just makes the process more inefficient, not easier to take advantage of, otherwise, you could go "manipulate" any of the alt coins or pink sheet stocks and make a lot of money.

Well, I'm not really trying to convince you.  In fact, from a selfish point of view, it is better for me if you do not come to this realization, as it will push the price up sooner.
Nonetheless to address your issue let's clarify terms.  When I speak of deflation, I am referring to a shrinking of the money supply.  This will causes prices to shrink as money becomes more valuable.  There is an additional effect on prices, and that is as a result from improved productivity and efficiency, prices drop.  These are two very different things that are beneficial to the economy.  The former because it encourages saving &amp; investing and discourages consumption, and the latter because the economy is more efficient at producing goods.
There have been times when prices have fallen, that correlate with economic decline.  This is not a situation where falling prices causes an economic crisis, but rather where an economic crisis causes falling prices.  When people lose their jobs/income, they cannot afford to consume as much, so sellers slash prices out of necessity.  This is actually a good thing, as it is the market responding to a situation of over-consumption, and becoming more lean.  It isn't fun to restrict consumption, but it is the necessary remedy imposed by market forces. 
What we can do is look at specific sectors of the economy where prices have fallen.  Consumer electronics, for example.  People can buy a better computer/TV/laptop for less money if they wait a year, and yet these sectors are delivering goods to consumers very effectively.  
TLDR- You cannot claim that declining prices causes hampered economic growth.

We are not Real (Bad pun concerning Brazil's currency).  
Loaves of bread are produced in a much more efficient manner than they were in 1980.  Wheat has been modified to grow faster/better and be more resistant, agriculturist methods have improved.  Retail logistics are vastly better than they were.  Companies have had 35 years to improve their operational efficiency--this is why prices naturally fall in a free market.
You are not aware of this because those gains (and more) have been stolen from you by inflation.  If Bitcoin were around in 1980 bread would be damn-near free and we would not have the problems with world hunger and people suffering from food insecurity.  You could probably buy a loaf of bread for a few Satoshis.

This is the kind of economically ignorant bullshit that I really hate and I'm getting sick of it.  You just make this claim because this is how you think things would work, but that is not the case at all.
There is a reason countries don't use deflationary currencies (yet), and that is because it benefits governments and banks to inflate the currency and profit from their creation of new money.

I literally lol'd at this.  But then I remembered that people actually believe this delusional nonsense.  Productivity is what allows an economy to grow, and this would occur with or without inflation.  Actually you would have more growth without inflation, as you would not have the inefficiencies associated with wasteful destruction of capital that is only allowed because of the CBs e.g. war, bailouts, etc.


I **absolutely** have been able to come to conclusions that are more correct than the so-called "best minds in economic academia.  I get it, as do others; the Keynesians do not. 
Rather than waste my time and this critical asymmetry of economic knowledge trying to get some silly Nobel Prize, I shall instead use my position to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible before the coming hyperbitcoinization.  I do this because I ***know*** Bitcoin will not only replace the Dollar and Euro, but also gold, silver, and bonds as well.
It will do this because Bitcoin has fundamentally superior monetary properties, and good money will drive out bad money.

I don't really need to prove it to you.  You're just wrong.  
That said, consider this.  There are times when people can invest their money in a "risk free" bond like a US Tres and make 5%.  They could absolutely have more spending power next year than they do today, and yet we do not see the effect you predict.
I do agree with you that people would consume less if their currency were not losing value due to inflation.  How can you possibly think this would be bad for the economy?  Is that what is wrong with the US economy??  Not enough dumbass consumers buying things they do not need?
In any case there is going to be spending going on.  In an extreme deflationary environment I would expect people would still spend money on things they:
1- Need (food, housing, clothing, transportation)
2- *really* want
3- Feel are investment opportunities that would exceed the risk-free rate of holding their money.
The last one is interesting, as if they amount of a currency were fixed the rate of increased purchasing power would be directly related to increases in economic prosperity.  (The same money being stretched over a larger economy is worth more per unit).
As such, people would only seek to invest if they feel their investment would grow the economic base faster and with less risk then it would without them making the investment.
Well fuck, that seems like a wonderful thing to me.

So is your complaint with Bitcoin or with your shitty market-timing strategy?
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:30:48
I think this argument appeals to me most.  It is why I originally decided to set a limit of coins.  What is the difference between being filthy rich and **obscenely** rich?  Is there anything I will be missing out on if I am *only* rich?
The problem I have though, is have difficulty finding an alternative investment direct my funds to other than Bitcoin.  While it is of course possible that I could be wrong, I am very confident that my view of economic reality is correct--specifically that the central bank currencies are doomed due to overspending and shitty government policies--so fiat money is out.  And so are bonds as a logical consequence. 
"precious metals" are really only valuable because of their monetary properties (their material properties are worth only a fraction of their price).  Simply put, Bitcoin beats the pants off gold when it comes to being money.   Why would gold exist as a store of value if there is a demonstrably superior way to store value?
I believe US equities are currently over priced....

Why would I want to give someone valuable information if I don't like them?
I see the poor as an amalgamation of worthless people who contribute nothing to society and people who would otherwise be well-off if not for the intrusions and meddling of evil government forces.  This will change when Bitcoin transforms the world economy into one that is fair and just.  When it does, I would prefer you own as little Bitcoin as possible, because you suck as a person and therefore should not have a lot of economic power.
I am happy to monetize my internet pride by begging for bits, because I realize those bits will someday be worth $1 each in terms of current purchasing power (not inflation-adjusted).  Bitcoin is just *that* valuable.  In addition to this, I am acquiring as much debt as I can and converting it to Bitcoin because ever little bit I acquire is just that much more economic power I will have in a few years.

That is what I am telling you.  Paradoxically, large entities have more difficulty understanding and responding to disruption than individuals.  The same is true for business as well.  There are certainly government employees who get it, but as a whole, government is, like always, incompetent.  Also the government workers who deal with economics and money are complete fools when it comes to this stuff--many of them think inflation is a good thing.  




Surely that will work!  Why don't you email the DOJ and tell them of this way you thought up.  They should be able to apply this novel solution to the war on drugs.  If they make drugs illegal, then people will not be able to accept them.   Of course there is the problem of enforcement, how do you prove someone traded...a number?


If only there were cryptographic tools that would make it easy to bypass such blocks.  Perhaps an Onion, maybe.


That's so brilliant.  Tell the DOJ to do this regarding drugs as well.  Perhaps they could tell people that using marijuana is bad for people and will turn their brains into fried eggs.  People will totally stop using weed, I suspect.


I trust cryptography more than I trust governments.  The thing with Bitcoin is, you don't need to trust shadowy figures, but with government you do.


Because you don't think someone could actually be an anarchist, or that they could hate a country that commits all manner of atrocities with the stolen money of its citizenry.  I am about sick of people dismissing pro-bitcoin views because it seems extreme to them.  Extreme things happen all the time and when they do most people do not expect them...then it becomes the new norm.  Of course you don't get it, of course it seems crazy to you.  If it were easy for people like you to grasp then Bitcoin would have *already* taken over.  As for why I would rejoice when America crumbles, this nation is the epitome of everything I despise, everything I see wrong with society.


Because you lack vision.  I have seen the future and it is glorious.  The immortal Bitcoin Hydra grows until governments finally realize it is going to destroy them all, at which point they try to fight it with predictable results.  Then you will see what it is like to live in a world without war, without oppression, a world in which people have economic freedom.

I think you and I disagree on what a bubble is.  Economic bubbles involve irrational speculation where the price of an investment becomes significantly detached from actual end use of the underlying investment.
Bubbles go up, then they pop and collapse.  They do not go up, pop, then go up again to new highs within a year or two, then pop again, and go back up to still new highs.  The fact is, bitcoin is still growing.  It is 4x what it was 12 months ago. 
Perhaps more importantly, it is more utility than it did 12 months ago, which is to say bitcoin is demonstrably more useful now than it was a year ago.

10: A person - who could be of either gender, but stereotypically is a woman - who allows their spur-of-the-moment negative emotional reactions to play far too large a role in their dealings with others.
The most recognizable characteristic of a bitch is a high volume of largely unmerited complaints about others. To qualify for bitchhood, these must be a conspicuously frequent feature of her conversation, and must strike most non-bitches as exaggerated if not completely unwarranted, at least occasionally to the point of making a big deal of things that strike most others as completely innocuous.

Hello there.  I am also in Mensa and personally I believe that Bitcoin is going to supplant all other currencies and as such I am heavily invested in it.  I did not come to this conclusion lightly and have spent a lot of time and effort in analyzing this situation and doing my due diligence.  In short, I believe Bitcoin has superior monetary properties and as such, it's is inevitable that it will grow until it consumes the entire world economy.
As to Mensa I can assure you that there are plenty of dumbasses in the organization.  Having a high intelligence is far from an indication that someone is correct in their reasoning.
If you and I are right, you will be very very very very wealthy.  When it comes to realizing the potential of someone there may be a sort of corolation between loneliness and eventual wealth.  Satoshi was literally all alone with his vision when he started creating Bitcoin, and is probably going to be the wealthiest person in the history of the world because of it.  You and I have and we arent really that alone.  If you wait until everyone is in, it will be too late to get rich.  Good luck.

People in libertarian circles bitch about their money losing value as it is "stolen" by the central banks, this is far from the biggest problem.  The stolen value is being used to fund crimes against humanity. 
Of course these crimes go by euphemisms like "War on Drugs", "War on Terror", and "protecting *our* interests abroad, but the deaths and suffering funded by this monetary trickery are very real.

That is true.  However if a coin is lost forever it actually reduces the liquidity of the Bitcoin economy.  
Consider that if all but 1 million coins were lost and the price remained the same--the network would be less useful in that it couldn't transfer as much value without running into price distortion.

I am aware of the fact that the vast majority of PhD'd economists disagree with me on the topic of deflation.  However, I, along with the other elite few who may or may not have been involved in economic academia, are simply correct, and the Keynesians are simply wrong.
You merely assert that deflation would wreck the economy, but you do not do anything to support this assertion.  While we cannot exactly run laboratory experiments at this level, I have taken great care in analyzing economic systems and it is my belief based on reason and evidence that Bitcoin, by being deflationary is a superior currency and thus will necessarily suck in all value from all other currencies.  Once this occurs, prices will fall as the money supply is constrained from expansion (or shrinks as people lose coins).  
This deflation will be a panacea to almost all of the problems our economy faces e.g. maleinvestment, big government, over-consumption, war, etc.   It isn't weird, but it *will* save the economy.  
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:53:07
Money is the vehicle by which resources are allocated.  Currently those vehicles are controlled by entities who act in their own self-interest, which causes a *tremendous* amount of waste due to malinvestment and over-consumption in the process.
Bitcoin cannot be controlled, and subsequently will make the entire world economy **much** more efficient.

I actually sold my gold to buy Bitcoin.  Here is my reasoning-  Gold has value because of its monetary properties.  In the event of a USD collapse, people would then flood into the next best money, which would be gold (limited supply).
But now there exists a money that is superior to gold.  
* It is easier to secure
* easier to transport
* it has a truly fixed supply (people can't go mine asteroids for bitcoins)
* easier to authenticate
If I am correct, Bitcoin will "eat" gold and silver as well as fiat.  Quite simply, there is no need for gold to exist as money now that Bitcoin exists.

It isn't really trickery.  If you sell a product for $100 and after you pay 2-3% in CC fees your profit is $2-3.
If you are able to sell the product for $100 without CC fees, your profit is $4-6
In order to make the same $4-6 profit on CC purchases, you would have to sell $200 worth of product.

It means it has less liquidity, and therefore is less useful.  However, you also need to adjust for the additional Bitcions that are now in the market that weren't at the start of the year.   But the price has dropped more than the value of the additional bitcoins, so yes, it is less useful

No, this is how an idiot thinks markets work.  
Bitcoin's long term success or failure is going to be completely independent of what Andreessen does or what anyone reading that or any number of articles does with respect to buying bitcoin.
Furthermore, at this point bitcoin is sufficiently liquid that even a 100 million dollar buy (or sell) isn't going to make that big of a difference in price.  Bitcoin is worth over 7 billion dollars, so we are looking at one percent.

I think the dollar's collapse will occur when investors feel they can get attractive returns.
Right now there are a lot of dollars just sitting in banks.  Imagine a dam holding back a flood of water.  Once people find that they can borrow money at low rates and invest it and get a decent return this will create a feedback loop where dollars flood into the economy, pushing up returns, which cause more people to borrow, etc.
In the past this has been Real Estate, Tech Stocks, etc.  It doesn't matter what the new thing is--it might be Bitcoin or it might not.  What matters is that these dollars make their way into the economy, which will cause foreign holders to dump theirs as the value plummets.  
When it happens, it will happen quickly.

You are correct that the size of Bitcoin is important, and that this could be a risk, however Bitcoin is over 20x the size of its closest competitor Litecoin.

Bitcoin's [as with EVERYTHING ELSE] value comes from it's demand.  How else would it have value unless people wanted it [demand]?  Do you not understand this simple concept?
How does this work in your mind?  You think that if people are actively trying to acquire as much of something that they can and horde it, the price will plummet?  How does that even play out in your mind?
Are you aware that price is a function of supply and demand?  So if suddenly people start hording bitcoins [demanding it] their price will...fall!?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  It's like your brain is incapable of functioning rationally.

I'm willing to stop hording...at a price.  But this is Bitcoin we are talking about, so it's going to take a lot for me to give up some Satoshis. 


Miners would be selling, so would people who desperately need (or **really want**) things such as food/clothing/shelter/crack/whores/crackwhores/etc.  I would also be willing to spend some BTC to purchase businesses which I think will generate more BTCs overtime.


I am advocating for other people to spend *their* bitcoin, preferably they should spend when buying something from me, so I can horde more Bitcoin.


So people horded Bitcoin, and then the price went up 1,000,000%.  Yeah, jackass, that's what I've been saying.

So your arguement is gold has "always been there" so therefore it will always have a place as money?
The reason I do not think this is the case is prior to Bitcoin, gold has served an actual function to the market--it was something whose quantity was demonstrablly scarce, and therefore was a good 2nd best option when fiat money failed.
The function gold previously provided is no longer needed due to Bitcoin.  As such, its price will decay to its actual usefulness to society (not much).

But why should I even care about the type of people in the "community" that uses a currency?  Would Bitcoin be less valuable if everyone who held bitcoin were a jerk?  Would it be more valuable if everyone who held it were nice?  Does money's value depend on how nice the person holding it is?
And it might be harmful.  Suppose someone doesnt know better and they buy Dogecoin because they precieve it as being cheaper than bitcoin.  That person would be harmed.  Dogecoin is essentially a pyramid scheme, as its only equilibrium state is at near zero because it offers to serve no market need that bitcoin does not serve

Hording is the key to bitcoin's success.  Hording causes more demand and more liquidity. 
Acceptance and even exposure for that matter do not matter, except to the degree that exposure drives more hording.  Demand, will eventually cause acceptance as more and more people want to horde it.

Hi.  It appears you do not understand feedback loops.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:54:39
If bitcoin were truly worthless, he would not need to lobby opposing it or struggle against it in any way, he would just need to wait until it died.
The reason people will fight Bitcoin is because it is very, very, very, very useful.  No longer can men be economically ruled by banks and financial institutions.  Money can no longer be arbitrarily seized by governments, and no longer can the value of money be siphoned off by the elite to wage seemingly endless wars against fictional and made-up enemies.  
In time this so-called reporter will bow to bitcoin, and beg it to be his master, along with everyone else.
Hail Bitcoin!

This is correct.  Here's an EIL5:
Hording causes increased demand.  Increase demand causes pool of value.  There is more incentive for merchants to tap into a larger value pools than small ones. 
Few merchants wanted a slice of the Bitcoin economy when it was a $1 Billion dollar pie.  Many merchants will want to tap into this economy if it is a $100 billion market

Am I too late for this one?  
My favorite thing about Bitcoin is that I sincerely believe it is-
*incompatible with the state--or at least big government.  The government gets the money it needs to fund wars (on Muslims, drugs etc) by printing money.  Bitcoin will render fiat worthless, and as such will require governments to get funding through taxation which is more difficult to hide.  This will limit the size and scope government can grow to.
*Immortal.  I believe government will one day realize it is a threat to government's monopoly on currency.  When this happens I expect govts will do everything in their power to kill bitcoin, and will fail.

This only spend what you can afford to lose bullshit needs to die a painful death.
No one ever says only hold in dollars what you can afford to lose.  That is because people are fools and think the dollar is a superior store of value to Bitcoin.  **It is not**
Bitcoin is a vastly superior currency that is necessarily going to grow in value relative to the inferior currencies it competes against.  You should put all of your money in Bitcion until you have so much of it that buying additional coins no longer makes practical sense.

I disagree with you.  My position is that if you understand economics and the nature of money, you will recognize that Bitcoin is absolutely a "sure thing"
It is really annoying when people like you dismiss people who say these things as morons when the reality is you simply do not come to the same conclusion we do.  Bitcoin is going to achieve what you consider to be its massive potential because it is a vastly superior money, and because of Thier's Law.  The fact that you do not get this does not make me a time traveler or a moron, it merely makes you poorly positioned to take advantage of the coming Bitcoinization of the world economy.

You should put some time into thinking about money.  ***Very few*** people do this, and even most economists don't have a clue. 
Start by thinking about the primitive societies and what they chose for money and why.  The conventional thought on this subject is very very wrong.  Money is chosen because of its monetary properties.  Once you have a complete understanding of the nature of money, look at Bitcoin and compare it to the monetary properties of gold/dollars/euros/etc, and then make your decision.
As for myself I have placed a good amount of my worth in bitcoin

Doge is not serious competition with bitcoin.  If it were, the bitcoin community would turn our processing power towards Doge, fork the hell out of its chain and destroy it out of self-interest.  That won't happen though because Doge will never be a threat to bitcoin.
It is not the fact that bitcoin was first, btw.  It is the network and liquidity advantages that bitcoin has over all others.  It would have been possible for an alt to overtake bitcoin earlier, but at this point, bitcoin's lead is simply too large.  That is why bitcoin is actually gaining marketshare in the cryptocurrency universe.

I will address your inflation points myself.  The other points, I will refer you to articles that illustrate my points far more eloquently than I could. 


It is for the people who hold the unit of currency.  When you hold Bitcoin, people benefit from the demand--namely bitcoin holders, a group which you are part of.  When you hold dollars, people benefit as well--the select group of people who have the ability to create new dollars.  


Let us clearly define what I mean by inflation.  With a fixed money supply, prices will go up, and prices will go down.  When a manufacturer develops a more efficient way of producing a good, the price will go down, but I do not consider this deflation--this is just a productivity increase.
I think most people think of money incorrectly.  They think of inflation is an expansion of the money supply, but that is not the case.  No expansion actually happens.  Any amount of money that can be infinitely divided necessarily has infinite money supply.  The entire world could function on one dollar (or Satoshi) if that unit were subdivided down sufficiently.  Whatever amount of money there is can just stretch over the market it needs to serve its function for.  Suppose that everyone who had a dollar would slowly accrue more money as they held it.  That is, if you have one dollar, and you do nothing, a year later you will have $1.05.  But so will everyone else.  Has the monetary supply really expanded?  I would argue that it has not, it has just been renamed.  $1 is now $1.05.  It would have no net effect whatsoever.
But that is not what happens with "inflation".  Instead of those little nickles appearing in the pockets of everyone who holds dollars, they all appear in the pockets of other people.  This is just a distortion of the money supply that reallocates it in the pockets of those who create the money.
People often claim that without this distortion, the sky will fall and the world will end.  But this is simply not true.  Why?
*  Well when people feel richer, they want to consume more.  Whats the point of being rich if you can't spend the money?  See "wealth effect"
* People still need to eat, and live their lives, so certain things would need to be bought.  No one is going to starve to death because they think they would be able to buy 5% more rice if they just waited a year.
* You claim that you would have no incentive to invest your money but that is certainly not true.  You would have incentive to invest your money if you could get a + ROI.  But then again, why would you ever want to invest a unit of currency if you didn't think you could get back MORE than your initial investment.  In a world with a fixed currency supply, sitting on your money is the new default--as the currency would grow in value to the extent that the economy grew as a whole.  Thus, unless an investment appeared to be capable of beating the economy as a whole, it would not make sense--it would not be worthy of the capital.  This pushes the bar up so that only above average justify capital investment.  Oh what horrors!  
* People effectively have deflationary currency right now.  That is to say that everyone who has dollars can, with some effort, invest those dollars in risk-free manner that will necessarily mean they will have money money later e.g. T-bills, whatever.  And yet, people do not do this.  People still spend their money.  Obviously if the effort required to get a + ROI were lower, people would be more willing to just sit on their money and consume less, but...wouldn't that be a good thing?  Surely you are not suggesting that the only thing wrong with our economy is that Americans do not consume enough!


And they all suck!  Countries go to war with each other, our "justice" system is a goddamn joke.  Consider having a rich white woman being charged with the same crime as a young black man...The court system is almost funny if it were not so tragic.  Governments ruin peoples lives for owning plants.  As for trade, protectionism causes so much maleinvestment...
Here are some excellent articles:
Why Bitcoin cannot be destroyed by governments (also keep in mind that there are multiple governments, and they cannot coordinate with each other sufficiently to ban a currency, as all it would take is one nation that does not act aggressively against the currency to allow it to thrive):

It is probably the case that a large part of visionaries were considered  to be "crazy" by the society they live in by suggesting things will be radically different in the future.  Drastic change is not something the mass populi considers to be at all likely, so to claim that such change is inevitable, is certainly going to be dismissed.
But I am right about Bitcoin.  It is a vastly superior currency, and it absolutely will continue to grow rapidly against all competing currencies until it has destroyed them completely.  Then Bitcoin will stand triumphant over the corpses of the Dollar/Euro/Yen/RMB/ETC and rain economic prosperity down upon us.

This is the kind of economic nonsense most people spew out of their mouths when they try to talk about money.
The first thing you should consider is why gold grew to be considered to be valuable.  The vast majority of people have no clue why gold is worth what it is today.  Claiming that it is very likely to remain valuable because it has been in the past is complete and utter nonsense.  Past performance does not indicate future results.  If you truly want to understand the future, you don't need to know what happened with gold but rather the underlying monetary dynamics that caused gold to be valuable in the first place.
Bitcoin and gold are not co-existing with each other in equilibrium.  No other money can co-exist with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin eats all other currencies.  **There can be only one**

@_date: 2014-06-05 15:20:41
Sure.  Suppose you know that 10% inflation is going to occur next year (everyone else expects the normal 2-3%).
You can buy a condo for $100k.  Your mortgage payment will be $800.  Or you can rent, for $800/mo.  If there isn't much inflation, it doesn't really matter which one you pick.  With renting you don't have to worry about maintenance and you aren't tied down, so I would probably choose to rent.
Now inflation picks up to 10%/yr, the next year my rent would be $880, but if I buy a condo, my payment is the same.  If I am able to do so, I would like to buy a couple of extra condos.  This year I can barely cover the mortgage costs by renting them out, but next year, I can rent them out for $880/each netting $160/month in profit.  If inflation stays at 10%/yr for 5 years, then I will be able to rent my two rental condos out for  $1300/month each.  I'm netting $1000/month in profit--more than enough to cover the $800 mortgage on my primary.
Basically, if you expect inflation in the future, you want to trade dollars for stuff, because the "stuff" is going to be worth more in the future, and you will be paying the debt off with inflated dollars.

The total amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist is known.  Functionally, it is no different than if these bitcoins already existed, but were simply not being used yet.

* Bitcoin relies on lots of infrastructure to function. You need a global network of computers, electricity, cell phones, and the internet.
** Any currency relies on its infrastructure &amp; network.  The USD currency relies on a network of central banks, US Secret Service, Dept. of Treasury, etc.  Gold relies on a network of assayers, vaults, smelters.  Bitcoin as a monetary system has far less infrastructure risk than competitors.  Also, if society find itself without computers, electricity, phones, or the internet, a square of shiny metal isn't going to save your ass.
* Precious metals are real. You can see and touch them. They aren't just made up numbers on a computer.
** Oh it's...real?  What the fuck does that even mean?  I would argue that gold is less real than Bitcoin.  If I have a bitcoin I can quickly identify, but with gold, I need to have it assayed and even then it could be filled with Tungsten or Osmium.  Why is ability to touch a unit of money important to you?  People tend to get confused about money because they see currency as a unit that has value--this is the wrong way to model money.  A better way would be to look currency as a ledger for keeping track of things.  In primitive societies people did this by remembering the favors they did for the fellow members of their tribes.  You couldn't see or touch these favors, but they were very real and they were the first currency.
* Precious metals have held a value through all of recorded history, even in many isolated cultures. They've withstood the test of time, while cryptocurrencies are new and untested.
**The argument here is that things have always been a certain way, therefore they will continue to be that way.  This is utterly absurd.  What the fuck does "test of time" mean anyway?  It isn't time that does anything to a currency but rather market conditions &amp; competition that occur over time, but up until 6 years ago Bitcoin did not exist and it did not face this competitive threat.  Gold may have survived the *test of time* in the past, but I'm damn sure it won't survive the test of Bitcoin. 
*Precious metals are actually scarce. You can't just create an exact clone of gold out of thin air and start mining it. And even if the entire world came to a consensus that the amount of gold that exists isn't enough, they could not increase the amount.
** They can and do create gold out of thin air in the form of fiduciary media.  Gold, being physical, cannot be moved around quickly which necessitates the market to create digital representations of gold, which are duplicated.  Incidentally if the gold price does get high enough it actually cann be pulled out of thin...water, in that it can be harvested from the ocean, or space via asteroid mining.  If the price gets high enough you can create it by fusion or just building a star...but Bitcoin??  You can't create more of that...
*Precious metals don't rely on network effect to retain value. You can't make a copy of gold with the same properties and call it something else.
** The only reason gold has (monetary) value is because people are willing to accept it as payment and horde it--this is a directly result of the network effect, such is always the case with any currency

I'm someone who has been fascinated with currencies/money my entire life. I am perplexed by libertarian metal bugs that reject Bitcoin...every time I see or hear them I'm like "wut?" Everything Au/Ag does or attempts to do Bitcoin does it better. It should be embraced as the embodiment of every libertarian's dream, but it is shunned by many who just don't get it.
The libertarian strategy for undermining fiat currencies has always centered on making gold and silver viable alternatives. This effort has failed because it is impossible to compete against a digital currency, like the dollar, with a physical commodity due to the high transaction costs associated with the latter. The only way metals can succeed is if fiat fails. While it may be the case that fiat currencies inevitably collapse over the long run, waiting for this possibility is unacceptable given the amount of damage that central banks are inflicting on humanity’s accumulation of capital.
The mantra of passing an Audit the Fed bill, miring it in scandal, and “legalizing currency competition” ignores public choice economics as well as the fact that **digital fiat currencies have already won the competition against metals and would win it again.** We don’t need another political solution to an economic problem, what we need is a more competitive market currency. Enter Bitcoin.

I do not consider "price deflation" to be a form of inflation/deflation.  "Price deflation" is just the price of good/services adjusting as per market demand.
As far as I (and other Austrian economists) are concerned, monetary deflation is the only form of deflation.  To answer your question, I consider Bitcoin's monetary base to be fixed at 21 million (with some units that are as of yet unclaimed).  For economic purposes, it makes sense to treat Bitcoin this way, because it is fundamentally different than inflation that occurs in fiat currencies (which is both unknown and unbounded).

You are correct that gold has non-monetary value and therefore will not go to zero.  However a currency that has non-monetary qualities is more of a hindrance than a help.  Currently, most of gold's value is because it is being used as money, when this ceases, we can expect gold's value to approach its non-monetary value, which will be very low relative to current price.

Bitcoin has a huge network effect advantage over all alternative cryptocurrencies.  In order to compete effectively against Bitcoin, an alt coin would need to offer something of value to the market e.g. have superior monetary properties to Bitcoin.  
This is not possible since:
1. Bitcoin is for all intents and purposes perfect money
2. Bitcoin can adapt, so if there were a desire or preference for some feature e.g. larger block size, consensus could be reached and the feature adopted
3. Bitcoin's network effect is huge relative to altcoins.  It has much wider merchant adoption, much higher liquidity, etc.
Since the altcoins offer nothing of value, we should expect their market value to be zero

That is only if you treat the monetary base as 14 or so million BTC and expanding.  I do not think this analysis is correct.  The monetary base of Bitcoin is 21 million (minus whatever coins are lost/destroyed).  As such, I think it makes more sense to act as though all 21 bitcoins exist, but 6.5 million are not yet claimed.
This may seem like a minor detail, but I think it is more in line the economic realities.

Inflation is not theft.
Theft implies the person being stolen from has no choice in the matter.  Bitcoin is to the point where everyone in the world has a choice.  They know or should know what happens to the fiat currency they hold, and by holding it they are consenting to its properties--one of those properties being it slowly leaks its value back to the state.  
Inflation is not theft, not anymore; theft is parting part of the phrase "a fool and his money are soon parted".  Personally, I hope the Fed inflates the fuck out of the Dollar, the ECB dilutes the Euro into oblivion and Abenomics drives the Yen into ground.  People who willingly hold governmental currencies deserve to have the money drain away--and the faster the better.

 The level of economic ignorance in society is breathtaking.  People who have no clue what the hell they are talking about keep parroting this nonsense over and over and the masses just accept it as true because no one bothers to think things through to first principles.


Well, you certainly would if presented with an investment that were attractive enough--meaning it offered you a higher ROI, discounted for risk, than not investing.  Money that loses value over time is shitty money.  Using a non-shitty currency certainly kills a lot of investment, specifically shitty investment that represents a tremendous amount of malinvestment waste.  In effect, a non-shitty currency raises the bar to the point that keeping up with inflation or breaking even are no longer good enough.
The other demonstrably false nugget of monetary voodoo that you seem to have been hoodwinked into believing true seems to be the belief that the act of hording currency somehow harms the economy as if the problem with society is people aren't spending/consuming enough.  The Keynsian intellectual zombies continually spew this rubbish ad nauseam, but the reality is hording--which is the result of producing more than one consumes is what drives economic growth.  Bitcoin will encourage saving &amp; production and discourage malinvestment &amp; consumption--the result will predictably be a more productive and efficient economy.

I think this problem is a result of not thinking about complex subjects by critically breaking them down into first principles.  The result is people get hung up on all sorts of bullshit and arrive at bizarre and demonstrably-false conclusions.  This is just as true for the metal bugs and for the fiat-loving Keynesian, as well as in many other areas outside economics.
Last year I had a conversation with a super-libertarian coworker who seems more against Bitcoin than the state.  It's like hating cancer, but hating the cure more.  There's no reasoning with these people.  They don't think logically and they aren't going to start.  It made sense to buy gold in the past if you expected a failure of a fiat currency (which I do), but gold is an utterly shitty money.  You have to put your gold in a vault and pay someone with a gun to protect it.  What the fuck is that wasteful bullshit?
Any person of any level of intelligence should be able to compare the monetary properties of gold with that of Bitcoin and correctly determine which one is superior and to what degree.  Eventually the market will figure this out and realize the efficiency of Bitcoin and act to drive out the inefficiencies of fiat/gold.

I'm am pretty confident that it will be the former rather than the latter, but I am damn sure which ever outcome it is will be independent of what people in this community do.  You can all sell for all I care.
In fact, there are some very good reasons why **you should sell right now.**  Soon the US Marshels will auction off 94,000 coins, and right now there simply aren't that many buyers.  What do you think will happen to the price then?   **Sell your coins**  Or don't, I don't give a shit.

*There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for government? But just pass the kinds of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted - and you create a nation of lawbreakers, and then you can selectively punish whomever you want*
To me, a plea bargin is inherently evil, is it *always* results in the incorrect legal outcome of any case in which it is used.  
In the case of a guilty person taking a lesser penality in a plea, the person is not serving the sentence that they should for their crime.  In the case where the person is innocent, he or she is being wrongfully punished.  It is **always** wrong, and it is demonstrably so. 
What is the difference between having a crime having a 1 year penalty, but putting people in prison for 9 additional years for the crime of insisting on a fair trial, and one in which the penalty is 10 years, but the government allows you to serve only 1 year if you give up your right to trial?  
In any case, even in the unlikely case you are convicted, I do not think you should fear a 20 year (or whatever absurd number) sentence.  The reality is our government is operating in a manner that is econmically unsustainable.  This process will come to an end, and when it does victimless-crime "criminals" being fed and housed at taxpayer expense will come to an end too.  You have my respect for not caving the the presure they put on you to try to scare you out of your right to a trial.

These things would not occur simultaneously but rather sequentially.  Think of a capacitor that gets overcharged, then fails and is subsequently unable to hold very much charge at all.

zzzzzz  Money that serves some other non-monetary function is by definition less useful as money.  I want a currency that is 100% focused on being money and nothing else.


Bitcoin's conformations are far more secure than multiple Ethereum conformations.  The reason Ehtereum hasn't had a civil war yet is because it is too small.  Whenever anything gets big enough, there's going to be a civil war.  Maybe one day...keep hoping I suppose.

I do not understand why there must be a block size limit at all.  Miners would have incentive to reject bloat unless it comes with a high enough fee.
And if someone is willing to pay to spam the network there is nothing to stop them from doing this now--the only difference is with a limit it would crowd out legitimate transactions.

* Governments are too incompetent to recognize Bitcoin as a threat to their existance
* It wouldn't matter if they did.  Bitcoin is immortal due to its decentralized and cryptographic nature.  I honestly welcome government attempts to destroy Bitcoin as it will be amusing to watch.  Ill say this--if Bitcoin can be killed by governments then it is worth nothing, if it cannot then it is worth...an infinite amount of national currency
* Even if governments were to try to destroy Bitcoin, they would fail because of Bitcoin's shroud of subtlety and allure will cause granular defections among the monolithic governing authority.  
As for me, I will rejoice when Bitcoin stands triumphant over the charred ashes of America.

Keynesian "economics" really fucks up the chance people would have of understanding economics.  It's nonsensical bullshit that is taught by the mainstream as if it were true and people are so misguided as a result.
I don't think I included a reading list, so I don't know what you are referring to.  But you should definitely check out this article   It really help me understand the thoughts on that aspect of monetary economics (the benefits of hoarding).  Another great article is  which talks about how a currency that is widely hoarded has a higher liquidity and therefore more useful than one that has thin liquidity.
Monetary economics is a fascinating subject if you get rid of the Keynesian nonsense you were force fed in college.  A proper understanding will give you foresight into how the competition between Bitcoin and USD/Gold/EUR/Etc. will play out.  best of luck, cerberus

Buffet also explained about gold:




When it comes to monetary economics and the nature of money, Buffet is profoundly ignorant and his success in investing has lead him to wrongfully conclude he understands money and things like gold.
The fact is, societies that spent resources producing currencies with a high stock-flow ratio were more efficient than ones that did not.  That is, gold mining has been a very efficient economic activity--and if it were not, societies that wasted resources mining gold would have lost out to ones that did not.
When you look at people digging gold up out of the ground and melting it into bars to rebury it, you may--if you are a fool, conclude this is a wasteful activity, but if you look closer you will see that they are using gold as a mechanism of accounting which is a very valuable function.
All the resources spent mining gold was worth it to maintain a shitty monetary spreadsheet, but bitcoin produces a far superior spreadsheet for a fraction of the cost, so it is *immensely valuable*
Warren Buffet will never understand this, and that's ok--he can miss out and lose money.

Very few people tend to "drill down" their reasoning or beliefs to what I call first principles.  If you think about money on a surface level and by looking at how things have been in the past and listen to so-called experts it might make sense to believe money must be "backed" by the "full faith and credit" of a government.
If you drill deeper you might take a position like the goldbugs, where you think money has to be "backed" by something like gold is.
If you drill down to first principles you will have an comprehensive understanding of money.  You will know why specific currencies became dominate, what good monetary properties an ideal currency would have etc.  Very few people get to this level, but if you think things through logically it is simply an inevitable conclusion that Bitcoin is going to completely take over the world.

I recommend not using Bitcoin to buy Steam games.  When you use a CC, if there is a problem you sure as fuck are not going to get customer support to do a damn thing, so by using a CC you can do a chargeback.
Steam understandably does not like this, but fuck them and their poor customer service.
From Valve's perspective though, Bitcoin offers a huge advantage in that they do not have to worry about CBs

The volatility has nothing to do with the fact that it is deflationary vs inflationary or centralized vs decentralized.  The reason it is volatile is entirely due to the issues addressed in your 2nd paragraph but that would be the case even if applied to a decentralized &amp; deflationary currency.  
Notwithstanding that you seem to think mild inflation is preferable.  That's fine, you can keep using a currency that loses value due to government manipulation of the supply and I will continue to use Btc.


That certainly is the case *right now* but you can't project that to say it will *always be* that way.  As Btc grows it will become less volatile due to its size.  Interestingly enough as Btc grows, the value of the USD will shrink and therefore become more volatile in the future.


I said it's easy; I didn't say people won't fuck it up.


I just did claim that.  It is interesting that you think a perfect money should be stable.  I do not think it should as economics are not stable.   Economic conditions change.

not really.  You could set a stop loss at 10% and then when it drops to that threshold you sell and buy something else and then lose money on that investment.
It limits your loss PER investment but does not limit your losses on a time basis.  It gains you nothing, but can actually hurt you because you will necessarily be selling at a lower price when it triggers.
I understand the concept.  It's a dumb concept.

I think it is important to develop your own thoughts from first principles rather than from so-called experts.  Once you have an idea of what works start looking at history and see if your ideals align with reality.  Then preform thought experiments--this can be particularly useful in dealing with things like criticism of deflationary currencies.
That said, here are some really good articles.  But don't just accept what they say as true--reason through every piece of their arguments.

@_date: 2019-03-18 00:48:01
I don't know if you are sincere, but if you are, ill give you enough to investigate further.
First you must understand that GDP =/= productivity.  A hard currency that will lower time preference (increase hoarding) WILL lower GDP.  But GDP is just an aggregate measure of spending.  If I go and spend 100k on cocaine and hookers, that adds to GDP but it is a negative for the overall economy.  Hoarding prioritizes high quality economic activity and punishes unnecessary consumption and low quality investments.
As to why currency hoarding is good-
First think of the advantages you as an individual have by hoarding cash.  If you hold enough of it, you can lower your insurance cost (raise your deductible, self-insure, etc).   If you were to be fully invested in assets you would have to sell investments to cover unexpected cost but with a cash reserve you do not have to do so.
At one level above that you can have a company that has a high cash reserve and compare it to one that is "fully invested" in assets.  If a market disruption comes along the company with the cash reserve is going to be more able to absorb that disruption.  
Currency hoarding provides better positioning to deal with unexpected disruption (and better positioning to take advantage of opportunities that come along).  
At one level higher still, an economy as a whole that has a large amount of currency hoarding is going to handle a situation like the 2008 housing crisis much better than one that does not.  As prices fall the hoarders are incentive to rush in and buy those assets as prices fall.  If there is little hoarding and most money is fully invested in assets, it can cause a liquidity crisis as asset prices fall much further.
Think of currency that is being hoarded as a reserve ready to direct resources when unexpected things happen, much like how generals will keep a portion of soldiers in reserve.  An uniformed observer may conclude those solders do not have a current effect on the battle, but this is not true.  Those solders in reserve allow the force to better take risk and to recover from errors.
There is of course a market balance.  Any investment that is low risk or that is likely to produce a positive ROI will be more attractive than simply hoarding the deflationary currency.  In any case, time preference is ALWAYS positive, so given the choice between consuming resources today vs 10 years from now, I am willing to pay more to have those resources now with a hard money, the market offers more resources in the future if I wait and if it is ENOUGH then I might wait.  Equilibrium is achieved somewhere--a market interest rate, if you will.

Whether or not a currency has good intrinsic properties is disconnected from volatility.  Anything can be volatile as it depends on how people interact with it, including dollars.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply that you can know with absolute certainty.    It is also super easy to secure; you can do it with USB drives or paper--you can't do this with gold or US Dollars.
Bitcoin is the perfect store of value, but it will be volatile until the rest of the world realizes this to be the case.

Bitcoin is not a replacement of a credit card.  As a payment system, credit/debit cards are VERY good and I do not see how there could be much improvement on them.  A centralized payment system is going to always be more efficient and better than a decentralized one.  Debit/credit cards are simply superior to BTC as a payment mechanism.
A better infographic would be tribal memory -&gt; seashells/or glass beads -&gt; gold -&gt; fiat currency -&gt; Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a superior competitor for shitty currencies, and money is an area were decentralization is far superior to centralization.

Volatility is not a function of the internal properties of a currency, but rather external function (how people interact with the currency).  The USD very well COULD be just as volatile.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply, is easy to secure/store/transfer.  Authentication is easy &amp; counterfeiting is impossible.  It also does not grant special privilege to certain players in the marketplace.  It's perfect money, yo. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:09:55
More generally the cost provide that service to the market is definitely lower via centralized system.  Decentralized systems are terribly expensive and inefficient and only make sense in specific cases where the centralized solution fail.
Everything bitcoin does could be done cheaply on a single laptop, but it makes sense to do this the hard/expensive way because otherwise some central party has control of that laptop.   With money decentralization is worth the very high cost.  With CC, not even close.

I'm sure there are.  Google has btc as a currency and gbtc is an etf that correlates with price so you put an alert there. 
As to why I oppose them.  A lot of studies have been done to see if stop losses lead to higher returns and there is no evidence they do.  In fact there is some that they hurt.
Consider the risk of the thing dropping to the limit then immediately going back up.  Consider the risk of you selling and buying something else that then goes down.  If you aren't confident in holding bitcoin or anything at 80% it's current price then you shouldn't buy it at full price today.

It drives good money out of that bullshit economy where there are laws that require/support the shitty currency.  Why would good money want to hang around in such an environment?
What is really happening if you look at the entire picture is **Thier's Law: Good Money Drives Out Bad**
Historically, it has been good, strong currencies that have driven out bad, weak currencies. Over the span of several millennia, strong currencies have dominated and driven out weak in international competition. The Persian daric, the Greek tetradrachma, the Macedonian stater, and the Roman denarius did not become dominant currencies of the ancient world because they were "bad" or "weak." The florins, ducats and sequins of the Italian city-states did not become the "dollars of the Middle Ages" because they were bad coins; they were among the best coins ever made. The pound sterling in the 19th century and the dollar in the 20th century did not become the dominant currencies of their time because they were weak. Consistency, stability and high quality have been the attributes of great currencies that have won the competition for use as international money.

One thing I really really really like about Bitcoin is that it is going to redistribute wealth TO people who have a deep and mostly correct view of economics (Silbert, Draper, Winklevii, Satoshi, Erik V., etc) and FROM people who do not understand economics and destroy capital with their profound ignorance (Yellen, Krugman, JP Morgan, all Central Banks, etc)
It's going to be a better world with people like Silbert et. al. having the majority of the world's economic power.

I think that items like tulips and beanie babies were an example of a market need that a good was attempting to fill.  There is a severe and critical need people have for an effective store of value and I think those goods temporarily signaled to the market that they could meet that need, only to then collapse under the market test of having a massive influx of capital.
I think all of these catastrophic bubbles are a sign of a great market need that has gone met throughout the history of mankind.  
I believe bitcoin will be the first good to survive this test but will also put an end to future bubbles.  That is to say who needs beanie babies when you have bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-18 15:58:18
1- that IS part of the market.  Can we agree that intent does not matter?  If I horde silver to try to convince other people to pay more for it or if I do so to build statutes of myself there is no difference economically.   Markets don't give a shit about intent.
If someone sells 200k btc the price will fall but it will also fall if the person does so to spend it on coke and hookers.  That is the market- it's his bitcoin he can sell if he wishes irrespective of what his motivations are.
2- the 2nd question is not semantic but real.  If somone sells 200k with the intent of dropping the price can help make money from doing this?  I say that no he cannot.  In simple terms dumping would drop everything the price but would not necessarily cause other people to sell at that price.  Even if it did, he would instantly negate that effect when he went to buy them back.  Markets just don't work like that.  Imagine you have a ton of houses in a neighborhood and you want to pick up more houses on the cheap so you dump yours on the market.  Home prices do fall but you can't do shit about it or gain money by this scheme.  If you try your just lose money.  Look at what happened in your own example of the silver brothers.  It doesn't work and people who try lose economic power

Why is money issued by a central cooperation necessarily inferior to that issued by a central government?
There are many instances of private issued goods being an okay store of value if their supply is controlled.  Comic books or MTG cards come to mind.  The problem usually occurs when so much value gets dumped into these goods that the underlying economic conditions are fundamentally changed.  
If BBs had not shot up like they did and the supply had been controlled it is possible they could have turned out more like baseball cards older lego sets that go for many times their original price.

Given what a shitshow the previous discussion of raising the blocksize  was, I do not have confidence Bitcoin would be able to react if we see 10-20x growth in a few years.  Regarding LN, that has risks of it's own.  It seems to me it adds some centralization risks to those who cannot afford on chain transactions.
Hard forks seem like they only get harder and harder as Bitcoin grows and I am worried that we are past the point where a fork can be done.  What if Bitcoin is stuck at 1.6 Mb max block size forever?  That is a real risk, that I see.

USD has lost a non-trivial amount of value 2009-2017.  
But more importantly the purchasing power of USD has greatly dropped compared to some goods--Bitcoin for example.  The dollar's collapse will occur all at once and will not impact all goods equally.  
It will start against superior stores of value like Bitcoin, and will then spread to other goods and services.  Those goods that are less able to adjust prices to inflationary pressures will be the last hit (and their margin's most severely impacted).

I think this is bad advice.  Sometimes it makes since to take on debt as part of a strategic investment opportunity.  People do this all the time to start a business, buy a rental property, get a degree, etc.
To me bitcoin presents a very unique investment opportunity.  I think it is reasonably likely that Bitcoin will supplant all other currencies including gold.  I also think the downside risk to Bitcoin is very low--e.g. it is hard to imagine a scenario in which Bitcoin--in the long term, does not increase in value relative to USD, which we know will inflate with certainty.

First off, it doesn't matter what kind of "name" or reputation bitcoin has.  It could be widely known and portrayed by the media that only terrorist use it to buy the drugs they snort off hooker's asses, it's not going to fucking matter because Bitcoin is STILL going to ROFLSTOMP all the shitty currencies.
Your fiat currency only has usefulness in your mind because you are profoundly ignorant of economics.  SURE fiat offers something of value to THOSE WHO CONTROL IT'S SEIGNORAGE, but not to ordinary people who can't print money.  People ONLY use USD, EUR, Pesos, whatever because the government makes it artificially difficult to use other currencies with bullshit monopoly laws.  
But laws don't apply to Bitcoin, cause Bitcoin don't give a shit.  So the only natural conclusion is that Bitcoin will bring about the end of the nation-state and set everyone free.

The only reason metals have the high value they do is because of their monetary value.  In the past, this may have made sense.  Gold is a bad money, but at times everything else has been worse.  In 2008, gold could have been a reasonable investment if you expected high inflation in fiat.
But it 2009, bitcoin exists.  Bitcoin simply has far superior monetary properties to gold, which it competes against.
Basically in a world that has bitcoin only a fool who does not understand monetary economics would buy the vastly inferior gold.

I'm not sure which fork will have economic consensus so I am inclined to hold both and see what happens.
Either way, I see one side not including replay protection as giving me a lot of grief, which I do not appreciate.  If 2x is worth more post fork it makes it more of a pain-in-the-ass to offload the other fork, and vice versa if 1mb is worth more.
Either way, I am going to be pissed at people who cause me unnecessary grief.

The reason bitcoin is going up is because it offers people something of value.
Bitcoin can absolutely be compared to gold and when we compare the monetary properties of bitcoin to the monetary properties of gold we can logically conclude bitcoin is far superior to gold and the price will necessarily reflect that superiority.  
Bitcoin will 100% certainly be worth more than all the gold in the world

I disagree.  Money is a market that tends to monopoly--that is, there is more benefits people as a whole to use one currencies than multiple competing ones.  We see several examples of this e.g. there is only gold and there are no competing precious metals*, or in primitive examples like the Yap stones, or even a game of monopoly.
In other words having multiple currencies is highly inefficient and market forces will act to drive out this inefficiency.  
Someone who has understanding of economics, monetary principles, and Bitcoin might reasonably conclude with a very high degree of confidence that Bitcoin's global dominance is not just likely but inevitable. 
I understand you don't get it, but that doesn't mean people who do are making a "stupid move"

Ah yes, I remember reading about the ancient Greeks using gold for their consumer electronic devices.  This is how idiots think money comes into existence.  It is complete and utter nonsense.  Gold is only used for jewelry because it is valuable, not the other way around.
The idea that a useful money needs non-monetary utility is demonstrably false, and all things being equal, a currency with no non-monetary utility is superior to one with such utility.

I understand you think that, but I believe differently.  I think mainstream economists are so far off on their thinking--and in many cases advocate for policies that are very harmful, that an average person would be more likely to support policies that lead to higher growth.
That is, if we split ALL people with a base level of education of say High School into those who have degrees in economics and those that do not, and each one had an identical economy to manage, the average economy of those not having degrees in economics would be more productive than the average of those managed by those with economic degrees.

This is not a crime in all markets and as far as I know is not one in Bitcoin--at least certainly not in the jurisdiction of all exchanges.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE A CRIME, even in equity markets.
Spoofing is essentially stating and offer to BUY or SELL and then sometimes (but not always) canceling prior to being field.  So what?  Should a person not be able to make such offer and then resend it as they wish?
People who think this is possible vastly overestimate the influence people have on others.  It is ENTIRELY up to the individual buyer or seller to buy and sell as he sees fit.  Such decision can and almost certainly is based on a wide number of factors, and the appearance of an offer--THAT CAN BE REVOKED AT ANY MOMENT, to buy or sell a "large" amount of Bitcoin may be one of them but it is still for the individual to decide of their own free will.  To suggest otherwise or that they have been tricked or manipulated diminishes their agency as a person.
The idea that someone can force someone to buy or sell by making and withdrawing an offer is absurd.  More over if someone were to do this, they would risk their order being filled in a sudden market shift.  Also, if this COULD lead to profitability then the market would quickly learn that buy/sell walls are not reliable information and would then move to discount this information as markets do.
That people think this is a viable strategy for extracting profits speaks volumes to the level of economic ignorance people have when it comes to markets.

No, bitcoin will survive just fine without these types of misguided and economically ignorant posts.


This will happen, but it won’t be due to magic, although I’m sure it will seem like that to the uninitiated.   Bitcoin will be universally accepted because no one will want anything else; this will happen because of economic necessity and does not depend upon anyone telling people to accept bitcoin.


I assume by “use bitcoin” you mean spend bitcoin.  If you spend bitcoin, you are an idiot.  Also, if you spend bitcoin you are not doing anything to help bitcoin grow; in fact bitcoin would be far better off if everyone would stop spending it, as it is simply too valuable to spend.


In this situation, you are a fool for being willing to pay with Bitcoin when you could use cash instead.  I prefer to use cash to pay for things and will continue to do so as long as people will accept it for payment, only then will I consider spending Bitcoin.


It is his choice not yours.  You do not get to dictate the economic choices of others.  What you would do instead, if you were rational, would be to take advantage of the fact that people will accept weaker currencies (for now) and continue to spend them.


This is an asinine assertion made by someone who has seemingly no understanding of monetary economics.


No, it doesn’t need to do that.  That will be the end result of all other currencies becoming worthless, but Bitcoin does not need to be used to purchase things by everyone or even many people.


This is how fools think money grows; it’s also how they end up with fewer bitcoins than they had before.  Rational investors should hoard bitcoin every chance they get, and would do so if they understood what is really going on here.


Or accept cash from everyone and buy bitcoin periodically.


That’s not how a currency rises to dominate an economy and if you think this it shows profound ignorance of money and complete lack of study on the subject.


This strategy will work out just fine.  To summarize here is the 3 steps you need to do for bitcoin adoption:
1) Buy Bitcoin
2) Sit around and wait
3) Profit

This is how an idiot imagines markets work.  If you honestly believe this is a viable strategy, then I encourage you go try it and  extract the return you seem to think you would get.  In reality you would end up losing money, but I realize you don't believe to be the case.  Also, you don't have the necessary capital to pull of this comical scheme you've convinced yourself is viable. 
Reality is you don't have capital is at least in part because you fail to have a good understanding of capital and how markets work.  You are like a fat person who goes around spewing diet advice.
There are plenty of people who think they have viable profit-making strategies like martingale casino betting strategies that they could use to make EZ-Money **if only they had the money**, but the reality is 1) you don't have the money to do this and never will, and 2) even if you did it wouldn't work and you would promptly lose your capital.
Just go try a martingale scheme at a casino instead.

It is not an opinion--it is a fact that is either right or wrong.  Of course I think it is correct.
Either the Keynesian model of economics is correct (in the many different claims and presumptions it makes) or it isn't.  In many cases I think they not only draw incorrect conclusions, but ones that are directly opposite of what is correct and policies they advocate for are harmful to the economy.
If it were possible to do--and to normalize for ALL variables these theories could be experimentally verified, so it is not a matter of opinion but rather disputed right or wrong facts.
Sufficient it to say in my experience Austrian economics seems to make a lot more sense and allow me to make more accurate projections regarding economics and monetary issues.

If technology did not benefit a group of individuals, that group could decide to branch off and create a closed loop economy that does not adopt whatever technology--think of something like the Amish.
The only thing technology does is give people more options, it does not force people to adopt it.  It may seem like it does, but that is merely economic reality--people COULD choose to break off and avoid whatever technology and would do so if it were more beneficial for them to do.

It is not possible, you economic fool.  But there are many different things called market manipulation.
In order for me to explain to an idiot why markets cannot be profitably manipulated I have to know what the idiot means by market manipulation.  Does he mean spoofing or pump and dump?  Or naked short selling?  Or does the idiot even know what these things are?
In your enron question, which I answered you merely respond with an unfounded assertion that enron profits were due to "market manipulation" which again you fail to define, just like you fail to understand how markets work and how you fail to earn enough capital to do this "manipulation" that you think is profitable.
You are just too much of a failure to even earn enough capital to try your bad idea scheme for yourself so you sit around on the Internet and complain that the market is really fair to poor people like you and that it is rigged for people who are rich who can use MAGIC to extract additional profits from the market using techniques you don't even understand well enough to articulate.
Keep believing markets work like that though.  You don't have to understand you can just be wrong.  Stay poor; my friend.

Herp Derp.  Any time someone starts a discussion about money with "Gold has held value for 1000s of years", I instantly know they are a complete idiot with no understanding of monetary economics.  The fact that a money was used in the past is not an indicator they will continue to do so in the future.
In all those 1000s of years that gold held value it did so without having competition from Bitcoin.  There is a new and far superior currency in the marketplace now and this is going to completely destroy gold.  This should be obvious to anyone with even a basic sense of understanding of how money works.  There have been many instances when an inferior money---that had "held value for blah blah blah years" came into competition with a new money that had superior monetary properties.
Guess how that **always** plays out?  The superior currency always wins and always will in.  People believing gold will continue to hold value against the competitive threat that is Bitcoin are going to end up in the same situation as West African societies that continued to use glass beads for currency after the Europeans introduced a superior currency to their economy.
The world will kneel before Bitcoin, which will take its place as supreme global currency.  All the evidence you need to see this clearly is there for anyone to see, but people still don't get it.  But by all means, please continue to hold gold/USD, and other inferior currencies while having no clue what is going on and no ability to explain the hyperbitcoinization as it rolls over you.

Do you really think it is even possible to project price (short or mid term) anything in the market?  In my experience there are too many variables to produce anything with anything close to usable reliability.
For long term, we can see the variables begin to have much less effect vs others such as the market's tendency to select that which provides the greatest utility for the lowest cost--or in this case the best currency vs very flawed competitors.

If you are looking at Bitcoin's past to try to understand the inevitable future of Bitcoin you are already doing it wrong.  If you want to understand Bitcoin's future, you must first look at and understand the history of money.  You need to fully understand what money is, what properties make a good money, what happens when currencies compete against each other where there is a disparity in their monetary usefulness.  Until you understand that, you will not be able to understand what is happening with Bitcoin.


Who cares?  Bitcoin does not need to compete with other payment options, as it competes with other currencies.  Eventually no one will be willing to accept any currency other than Bitcoin, then it will compete with "other payment options".


Well i've got good news and bad news.  The good news is, Bitcoin does not need you to believe in or participate in order to take over the world's monetary system.  The bad news is, you're going to miss out on the greatest shift in economic power the world has ever seen, but I am OK with that.  You will just have to adapt to the new economic reality, because you simply won't have a choice.

This is such a garbage and useless graphic.
First off, This does not account for supply, which to visualize price progression without supply consideration is mind-numbingly retarded.
What typically--as in always as far as I can tell, happens is that a price increase in *anything* will generate more supply of that that thing.  This is true for bennie babies, tulips, housing, and even dot.com stocks. 
Once the newly created supply generated by this price jump hits the market, the price adjusts accordingly.  With Bitcoin the supply IS fixed and therefore immune from this very significant factor.  
When Bitcoin was at $19k/ea. people weren't working hard to produce MORE bitcoin to meet this demand.  If they had, this now excess supply would be weighing the market down now and combined with the drop in demand would be very bad for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin with it's fixed supply, does not follow the same rules as asset bubbles and really cannot be a bubble in this sense.

That is not manipulating the market.  It is TOTALLY legit to broadcast whatever non-fraudulent signal a person wants to the market.  If a billionaire announces he is considering buying a bunch of real estate in XYZ city, while selling it, that is 100% totally legitimate.  
Buyers and sellers are free to listen to him or not, no one has been manipulated against their will.   People who talk about manipulation dont know what the fuck they are talking about and VASTLY over estimate someone's ability to manipulate what is a very complex and intelligent market.
Even in the example I suggest of real estate it is very likely the person could lose money.  So once you account for risk, there is no way to gain extra profit by market manipulation.  IF THERE WERE, people would be doing it, AS THEY SHOULD.
If you sell or buy because someone told you to then you are an easily manipulated dumbass, but the market as a whole is not susceptible to this rent-seeking nonsense and would act to punish people dumb enough to try it

2) as long as fraud is not committed I see no problem with people trying to do this (though it is to their detriment)
3) some of these manipulation schemes take on a lot of risk in their attempt to gain a profit and it is very likely a person attempting this would lose money doing so.

Do you consider it a good thing that people continue to waste their time and labor on useless pyramid activities?  


I agree with you that these things would happen, but consider these to be a very good thing.  Would you consider it better for these pyramid workers to cease their work but still continue to be paid?  Would that be better than continuing things as is?  The pyramids are of no value and this way there would be fewer injuries and those people would be able to spend time with their families instead of working in the pyramid industry.


What about the workers of other productive industries who are struggling to pay their mortgages &amp; debts because part of their earnings are being siphoned off through taxation to pay for building and tearing down pyramids?  What about all other industries that have to pay more for brick and labor because that society has the pyramid industry competing for those limited resources and driving the prices up.


I again agree with you that this would happen.  I would consider those to be part of the pyramid industry.  Imagine that industries exist on a spectrum with pyramid building on one side, and productive non-pyramid industry on the other.  There are many companies that exist in between, such as a restaurant near the pyramids whose business is 80% pyramid workers and 20% other, perhaps there are suppliers of machinery that have a 60/40 split, and others that have a 20/80 split.  A sudden stop to the pyramid waste would be like a fire starting with the pyramids but also spreading to those with high economic propinquity to that activity—that is, business whose business model &amp; revenue is dependent on the pyramid boondoggle would be more severely burned than those that are more distant.  I think we are in agreement that the activity that is most productive would continue—that is the owners of the farming or fishing business are going to continue.


Businesses would be hurt in proportion to their exposure to the pyramid industry.  The fishing and farming business would suddenly see a sharp decline in their cost of labor.  The price of stones would fall precipitously.  Factories that have been producing a pyramid construction and demolition equipment will suddenly have a strong incentive to fill that market void with farm and fishing equipment. That is, they along with individual providers of labor, as well as the economy as a whole would be shifting their resources to more productive uses.  There would be pain as is the case with change, but the alternative of persistence of the ongoing waste of resources &amp; labor is much worse.  In addition to the pain the disruption would free up resources and allow industries that are productive and distant from those dominated by Big Pyramid to expand.  You see the pain of disruption but not the opportunity for growth due to the abundance of resources that suddenly appear from the elimination of waste.


The result would be that the influx of supply for homes would suddenly drive he value of all homes downwards hurting everyone who owned a home or property.
You are simultaneously claiming that people cannot afford their home mortgages but also that home prices would fall.  Both of these would occur.  There may be foreclosures and a shift from those who do not having savings and are thus ill-prepared for economic disruption to those who do have savings and are prepared to purchase these homes at distressed prices.  The houses would be a wasted resource if they were uninhabited, thus the market will drive people to make the most productive use of those homes. 


This is a good thing.  The government was using tax revenue to build and destroy pyramids over and over, so perhaps they are not the best stewards of capital.  Government services that are essential will be prioritized over wasteful nonsense.  Hard choices will have to be made, but this is far better than not making those choices and continuing to waste resources on things like pyramids and pyramid regulation.


Which means...labor cost would fall AND there would be plenty of low cost labor for the productive farming and fishing industries to expand.  With low cost of labor and cheap resources, you would have some of the farming and fishing companies experience massive growth.  The Keynesian would see GDP falling and people out of work, but what is really happening is the economy is healing, adjusting, and becoming more productive.  You see, Keynesians do not care only about spending or economic activity in the aggregate.  There is not even a thought given to the quality of that economic activity or whether it is wasteful or not.  In this hypothetical aggregate GDP falls, but the portion of that GDP that remains is of higher quality and more productive—and that portion now has the resources freed up from the pyramids that it can use to grow.


And economic power would shift to those who do have savings.  This is an illustration of the importance of savings, as a person, company, or even a whole economy with higher savings is better able to absorb unexpected economic disruption than one with low savings.


The value of USD actually increased significantly in 2008 as people fled to “safe” cash.


Suppose there are two closed identical pyramid producing islands.  On one island, you allow people to keep building pryamids that are paid for by taxes on the fishing and farming industries; perhaps you *slowly* draw down the pyramid industry, but this moves at the pace of government as you have pyramid-lobbying groups spring up that spout the need of continuing to build and destroy the pyramids.  On the other island, I end the practice right away and many people are suddenly unemployed, forced out of their homes, and have to rely on charity while they frantically search for the jobs of the growing farm and fish industry.  Perhaps some even start new industries out of their desperation.  Perhaps many of these fail but those that are productive are able to pull in the investment and capital freed up from the pyramid elimination and start to thrive.  Which island do you think will be better off in 10 years?

I held the view that I think you are making for quite some time--that Bitcoin is not inflationary.

I think this would be the correct way to view Bitcoin if the market were rational *and* capable of looking forward to the future to discount future supply into the present.
D. Krawisz wrote a good [article on this topic]( but I started looking into past examples of a currency supply increase that was known of in advance.  In particular the influx of gold coming from the new world in the 1500s.  Eventually this would lead to a crash in the price of gold, but it took a while for this wave to propagate through the market.  If market actors were rational, this known supply increase could have been discounted into the current price of gold right away, but it was not.  
Similarly the glass beads of W. Africa, or the Yap stones did not collapse as soon as their future supply was known but only after this supply had entered their respective economies.  I would even go so far as to say's Volker's increase in interest rates in the 80s did not impact prices until this easily forecast supply constraint hit the market.  
Basically the market when it comes to money is like a blind person walking forward unable to accurately price in future (but unclaimed) currency stock.  If it were, I suspect bitcoin would be much much higher already.  Lastly, I would say that at least so far there has been a large price increase about 6 months or so *after* each halvening, which would suggest the market is unable to see and adjust for these future events and only makes the price adjustment after the supply shock has occurred and rippled through the economy

Ultimately I think this will lead to a more efficient market that allocates capital in a far more effective manner.  Productivity will skyrocket while consumption declines.

Regarding taxes I do oppose any tax payer funded programs where the funds are derived from force.  I would probably be fine with choosing to contribute some of my money to things that may not directly benefit me, but I am in no way okay with anyone having their property taken by force which is exactly what taxation is.


Let them profit if they can find a way to do so.  I do not support creating laws specifically to make this easier for them, and in fact they are able to do so even in areas where their works fall into public domain.  My copying their work does not in any way deprive them of their work.


I would argue that laws discourage creativity.  We see more creativity in areas that do not have patent/copyright protection.  Look at all of the stories and movies that are produced by fans of media but that cannot be distributed en mass due to these BS laws.  Look at recipes which are not covered, or software before it became eligible for patent protection.  The Mona Lisa was painted before copyright protection.  Do you think people will stop creating things without these laws?   How were humans creative before these laws came about?  What of all the resources wasted fighting over royalties and patent trolling?  Things are simply better when information is free.

The point is it is a superior currency with monetary properties that are far better than other monies in the marketplace.  You should rationally conclude that Bitcoin will grow in value because it competes against "bad money"
In the 1930s FDR did something similar in that prior to this, you could buy and sell gold at banks and hold it yourself.  Then it became illegal to do so.  Without looking it up, what do you think happened to the price of gold when this occurred?

Investors do not follow an investment because of the name associated with the investment.  If today Bitcoin forked into something called "Bitcoin" but fundamentally different, lets say no supply limit, and another fork which due to an unfortunate marking snafu became commonly known as *magical ass pennies*, then the *magical ass pennies* would be the dominate chain and would grow to take over the entire world.
What matters is liquidity.  If all coins appeared at the same time, one would gain a liquidity advantage for some reason or another, and then that initial advantage would catapult its lead further.  Basically it doesnt matter that bitcoin came first, but that it did come first gave it the liquidity it needed to dominate other later arrivals.

In my experience, consensus on contentious issues is usually only reached after intense debate &amp; discussion.  Why is there opposition to allowing this discussion to occur here?  Part of that discussion is the threat to fork to XT.  In ANY case if there is a potential fork of Bitcoin to BitcoinXT &amp; Bitcoin-nonXT that is an issue that very much impacts Bitcoin as a whole and therefore is worthy of discussion on that point alone.
If Bitcoin cannot endure vigorous public debate with threat of hard forks without needing censorship to protect it then it will not endure at all.

A 17 yr old girl ( or boy) can take a picture of themselves, send it to their SO and then they can both be charged with possession or distribution.  In this case I do not see that a person has been harmed except by the draconian application of law by the state.
It really bothers me when the state tries to misuse and abuse semantics to try to increase its power.  In some states a 17 and 18 yr old having sex is classified as rape and them sharing pictures is a also classified as an emotionally charged felony that would brand them both sex offenders possibly for life.
Fuck that.  I just don't trust the state enough to support giving them the broad authority it is given by making possession illegal. If they stopped with the semantic game and over reach of power then sure, but they won't.

@_date: 2015-08-25 15:53:26
Owning any one currency carries a high opportunity cost of owning any other. I cannot use the same money to buy an investment in bitcoins and in silver coins or Canadian dollars. If I want more of one, I necessarily must have less of another. If any one currency is acknowledged to be the winner over the rest, then there is no additional benefit for anyone to own other currencies.
The world is not big enough for two currencies. Any initial disparity between two currencies, no matter how small, positively reinforces itself, and there is no reason to expect this effect to end until one currency is driven out of existence. As the price of currency A begins to rise relative to currency B, holders of currency B begin to see that their investment is looking less and less reasonable. As more people flee currency B, its decline accelerates until it has effectively ceased to be a currency.
This conclusion does not appear to be borne out by our everyday experience of different national currencies within each nation-state. This is explained by the fact that these states typically have legislation such as legal tender laws and capital controls that artificially reduces the usefulness of other currencies within their respective borders. There is no jurisdiction in which Bitcoin is legally privileged, so there is no group of people required to treat it differently than any other. Thus, there is no reason to expect Bitcoin ever to be in a stable equilibrium with any other currencies, including altcoins or forks of itself.
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:47:48


you are incorrect here.  There is no stable equilibrium in the realm of money.  Every economy moves toward use of one currency in the absence of government interference and meddling.  Bitcoin is immune to such interference so it is necessarily the case that Bitcoin will grow to complete total domination of the world economy and it's 10 year history of growth is exactly what we would expect from a superior currency competing with weaker soft money

@_date: 2019-12-07 14:50:58
That's not the definition of fiat money.  Fiat has come to be known as money that has value because of government decree but this is not the case 
If you look back at Mises' works you will see that fiat actually means signal money-which is money that does not have intrinsic (non-monetary) value.  The other two types of money are commodity money (gold) and representative money (paper backed by some commodity).  Bitcoin is clearly neither of those.
I would even go so far as to say I dont think government can make a money have value by simple decree--that is it is monetary properties that dictate value, not government decree, though decree can impact the expectation of future monetary properties

It doesn't really matter if more adoption comes, of course it will because of Bitcoin's properties. 
Suppose Bitcoin does not gain any further adoption and remains a money only used by "conspiritards".  We "conspiritards" will be using a currency that is better at storing value than the currency you are using, so over time we would accumulate more and more wealth while you continue to lose it.  
If you have a non-inflationary currency competing with an inflationary currency the non-inflationary one is going to win.

That is simply not true.  If you divide the US population into quintiles (0-20%, 20-40%, etc), you will find that ~60% move into another quintile than the one they were born in (either up or down).
I have data for this if you care to review.
How does capitalism bring death and violence?  This is not to say there is not those things in a capitalist system, but capitalism certainly does not depend on them.  But anyway I dont like semantics.  What I really advocate for is economic liberty--people and corporations should be able to do as they like as long as they do not infringe on the rights or directly harm others.
With socialism, there is no way to enact its ideology without using force to take private property from people.  What gives you the right to take what other people have earned?  What makes you feel entitled to their labor &amp; efforts?

HEY Fucktard, 
Nothing you linked says the cost averaging would lower your average price.  Obviously it wouldn't if you just reason it out.  In particular if you read the first paragraph under the "Criticism" section it explains that there is no increased return and does not lower the average cost.  IT IS ONLY A STRATEGY FOR VOLATILITY MITIGATION AND DOES NOT INCREASE ALPHA.  But you are probably so beta you don't even know what that means.
Also, I am really amused that you Trump haters spew your political drivel in areas where it is not relevant.  Politics really has nothing to do with the point in question, which is does DCA lower avg cost basis--Which even an idiot could tell you does not, and which is also supported by the links YOU cited. 
In any case, you liberals seem to have a REAL hard time dealing with the fact that your feminist queen got ROFLSTOMPED by Trump in the election.  It's going to be a LONG 8 years if you don't get over your tremendous and sad loss.  Good luck dude.

What I love about Bitcoin is how whatever malicious actions are made against it, only serve to make it stronger.
Bitcoin easily adjusts and deflects or absorb attacks like an Aikido  master.  If some central government tries to ban bitcoin mining, the network will simply adjust to mine elsewhere.  Even if the entire world's governments were to collectively ban bitcoin, it would adjust to mine in the shadows, enriching those that ignore the law while simultaneously tempting government actors to defect with the allure of their econoimc self-interest

Buying over time does not lower your avg buy-in price.  It would only do so if the price drops.  If the price goes up, this would actually increase your avg price.
What dollar cost averaging does is lower the impact of a sudden price move.  This is commonly touted as an investment strategy but it loses out to a lump sum approach where you just put all of the money you intend to invest into the investment all at once.  DCA is an emotional response to the fear of throwing all your money in and then having a crash shortly after.  It does not increase alpha and hurts your returns, statistically speaking

This is what an idiot Keynesian thinks makes money valuable. 


Holding Bitcoin is what creates demand for Bitcoin and raises the price.  Only Keynesian fools think spending money makes it valuable. 
Consider that in a hyper inflation event, of which we have many historical examples, those currencies do not die because people stop spending them, they die because people stop being willing to buy (accept) and hold them.
Also consider that after the Silk Road went down, the frequency of Bitcoin transactions dropped but the price increased greatly, thus increasing liquidity and improving Bitcoin's utility.
You need to understand that it is the holders of a currency that make it valuable and spending is completely irrelevant.  Consider Gresham's and Thiers' laws about how good money and bad money interact in an economy.
We currently have good (hard, deflationary) money (bitcoin) and bad (soft, inflationary) money (US dollars).  Why the hell would anyone spend Bitcoin when people will accept US dollars instead?
You should expect the bad money to drive the good money out of circulation the same way bad coins (1965-present) drove the silver money out of circulation in the US.    It is only when no one will accept bad money any longer that people would rationally want to spend their bitcoins.

Bitcoin not only has all the properties a currency needs to succeed, but it has *the best possible monetary properties a money could have.*
If you think a currency needs to be "stable" in a market that very much dynamic and very stable, you are setting yourself up for a massive failure because the price you pay to avoid market-adjusted pricing is that your currency becomes very fragile and prone to black swan events. 
One of these days your man behind the curtain is going to pull the wrong lever and you're going to get promptly fucked in the ass by a big black swan.  And when this happens, I'm sure you will loudly blame bitcoin, but really you will only have yourself to blame.

People want a way to manage accounting between each other.  This is what money is. 
If you want to know what something is for, look at what people actually use it for.  People hold currency until they want to commit to an investment.  The moment the divest themselves of this currency they are no longer the user of it, but rather the new holder is now using the currency.  An exchange is change point where one entity stops uses a currency and another starts using it.
Currency is useful in that it gives you flexibility to remain uncommitted and well positioned in terms of liquidity.  Currency would be MORE useful if it did not have negative features like inflation.

I think the Tulip thing--although likely greatly exaggerated was a the market acting as it should.
There has always been a market demand for a good money and Tulips, along with many other examples, briefly had monetary properties superior to the other currencies available at the time.  This pulled in market forces and "tested" tulips as they began monitization.  Of course they failed and the price collapsed.
I think Bitcoin is likely to be the first currency that will pass this test of monitization fire, and will also put an end to wild speculative bubbles that come about from a currency contender attempting the monitization process.

...Go read about Rai stones which very rarely circulate and come back and tell me they are not a currency or money.  I am so sick of this ignorant fucking Keynesians going around spewing this bullshit idea that a currency MUST circulate in order to be a currency.  No, it doesn't and if you believe it does you are just fucking oblivious.




Yes, RE is a an example of a currency in that it has both utility or "non-monetary" value and monetary value.  People often buy RE as a long term store of value because they don't have access to better alternatives like sound money.  Bitcoin will eliminate the portion of value of RE that comes from its function as currency.  Same is true for art.




Get the fuck out of here with your Keynesian garbage ideas.  Markets are not static or stable.  Markets relying on price signaling to solve countless Supply-x-Demand equations.  If because of increased productive manufacturing a Coke becomes less expensive, then that should be communicated to the market via price changes.  When you keep fucking with price you distort this market signal and introduce inefficiencies.  You ALSO give a HUGE advantage to the holders of the newly created money--which, spoiler alert: IS NOT YOU.  Where do you think this advantage comes from?  Do you think it falls out of the sky?  Spenders of newly created money acquire their purchasing power from dumbfuck holders of the existing supply of said inflationary currency.
I'll tell you what, you keep holding your dumbfuck soft inflationary money, and I'll keep holding my immortal hard deflationary magic internet money and we will come back in 10 years and see who was right and who is an ignorant jackass.  Deal?




What is the end supply of a currency that has 0.75%/yr inflation?  The answer is that the supply is infinite.  
If people have a choice between a soft money w/ 75 basis points of inflation and a hard money with zero inflation, the hard money will win out EVERY TIME, and the inflationary garbage will be reduced to zero because it cannot compete against 0 inflation.

I suspect that the tulip bubble was roughly on par with the beanie baby bubble +/- one order of magnitude.  
I have spent a lot of time thinking about bubbles and I have come to the belief--which I know is very laughable, that they rational events at least in part.
Basically my idea is that the market has a demand for a better money, and occasionally something like beanie babies will come along that momentarily has good monetary properties and starts down the slide of monitization but which fails as price increased draw in more and more monetary pressure most notably in the form of triggering a supply increase which destroys the scarcity that was previously displayed.
With Bitcoin I do not think this is possible as when the price spikes there is not anything that can be done to produce more of them beyond the predictable block reward, as a result I think Bitcoin is going through the same monitization test that tulips and beanie babies went through but is continuing to grow as it survives the increased monetary pressure.
TLDR- Bubbles are in part the market trying to fill the need of a high quality and scarce money.  Bitcoin will be the first currency that adequately meets that market need.

You are misunderstanding what it means to use a currency.
Let me propose an alternate.  A person begins using a currency when he or she accepts it and continues using it while he or she holds it.  He stops using it when he buys something with it.
You need to see currencies as a sociological tool.  They are ledgers that a society uses as an accounting scheme. 
There are many many historical examples of competing ledgers fighting it out in the marketplace and it is clear and obvious what monetary properties the winning ledger will have.  This is how I can be completely certain bitcoin will overtake all other ledgers (usd, gold, et. al.) 
You mention gold as having non monetary value in addition to its monetary value (its value that comes from its use as a ledger).  This is actually a bad thing for gold.  All things being equal a currency that has solely monetary value will have superior use as a currency than a money that like gold has both a monetary and a non-monetary (utility) value.  
That is, I don't want a money that you can use as jewelry.  I don't want a money that people buy coffee with.  I want a money that people hoard like Smaug and whose demand is ever increasing  but whose supply is fixed (deflationary)

Emphasis mine. And yet it does, so you can either continue to be an ignorant sheep that keeps spewing nonsensical Keynesian ideas about how money must change hands frequently....
Or you can revisit your assumption because the market clearly seems to think that Bitcoin has a lot of value and that value has been increasing over time from zero at its inception.
You need to understand that it does not matter at all how frequently a currency is exchanged.  Look at Rai stones.  Look at what happens to currencies when they die via hyperinflation.  Do they stop being traded and then lose their value?  Or...do they keep getting exchanged at higher and higher frequency until their value is completely zero and no one will accept or hold said currency?

Is high speed rail a good use of capital?  I have no interest in contributing to this project but I do have other interests I am willing to contribute to.  If enough people want to contribute their capital to a project then it can be done without a government forcing everyone to do it.


This happens now.


 Will we be able to BORROW against a bitcoin? If so how? If not why not?
Debt is not necessary for a healthy economy.  That said there are ways someone can borrow funds with an immutable ledger.  I suspect it will put more emphasis on reputation and sound lending, which would remedy a lot of problems we have with loose lending.


Individuals.  It's called liberty.


Maybe it isn't good to give capital to people who have no capital and cannot make a convincing case &amp; business plan to others.  If someone can demonstrate a plan that will likely return more than the deflation will (adjusted for risk), he will be able to get funding, if he can't maybe he shouldn't.


Money or capital comes from the owners of that capital, or capitalist if you will.  I suggest you read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged for more on this topic.  Using a system that allows they money supply to be arbitrarily expanded to the benefit of certain privileged parties does not make this situation better--it makes it much worse.


With ability to settle on-chain bitcoin is resistant to fiduciary media.  Basically with Bitcoin, this disconnect will not happen--who is willing to accept the "backed" coin as it comes with an element of counter party risk.


What is achieved is a secure ledger for money that cannot be expanded, edited, or controlled by a centralized entity.  


Legal protections are not sufficient for protection of capital--see the failure of the Constitution to protect against civil forfeiture.  Encryption, however, is very effective at telling the government to fuck off.  


Government's threat of violence is not sufficient to halt the use of drugs, how much less effective is it going to be at keeping people from using a currency that gives them economic freedom and autonomy?    Bitcoin's properties make it especially resistant to government attempts at capital control, but it also acts as a catalyst to dissolve centralized entities.  Bitcoin will simply provide incentives for government actors to defect and act in their own individual interest.  In other words, government (as we know it today) and bitcoin cannot exist in equilibrium and bitcoin is immortal.  This is not going to end well for government no matter how hard they try to fight bitcoin.


Nothing is stopping the IMF or governments of the world declaring bitcoin illegal, but I nothing is going to make me care.  Fuck them, and fuck their control of money.  I hope they do declare bitcoin illegal so the world can see how impotent their tools are.  Bitcoin is immune from capital controls and government laws.

Yes, increased money supply is inflation.  People often refer to something called "price inflation" which I believe is a horrible misnomer.

This is NOT inflation, inflation is monetary inflation or the increase of the supply of a currency and of course it follows supply/demand curve

Economic activity is a very vague term.  I can pay a hooker and even provide her with a job, but this does not say anything about productivity or if those resources are prudently allocated.  Imagine if everyone is rabidly trying to hoard bitcoin.  They are going to be doing everything they can to acquire (earn) more, they would be working extra hard and reducing their consumption.  Hookers would go out of business because no one would be willing to waste such valuable currency.  Only investments that are likely to produce a good ROI or consumption that is *really* desired would be pursued.    So you're saying in a situation where people try to work to earn as much and consume as little as possible is one that would not result in wealth creation??


If those innovators want to hoard money they are going to do everything they can to earn it.  Are you saying people won't work because the money they would be paid in is *too valuable*?


I am not happy with law enforcement and I demand a better solution.  Preferably one that doesn't shoot innocent people and violate rights with impunity. 


Then those things can continue to exist if people choose to fund them.


With bitcoin, if someone takes a tumble out of the 1%, no one is going to bail them out by taking from the other 99%.

Governments are very expensive.  A significant portion of the cost of governments is covered by seigniorage, and without that government would have to collect that revenue through taxation.
Basically without a control of money, I do not think government as an entity is not viable, at least to the extent we know today.  Bitcoin will also impact government's ability to borrow money, which is a 2nd way government finances itself.   With these two funding channels cut off, I don't think government can exist in its current form.

I think we disagree fundamentally on what money is.  For me money is merely a ledger used for accounting &amp; tracking.  That's all gold/seashells/fiat/yap stones are--shitty spreadsheets.


*Being wrongfully convicted of a crime 
*Seizure w/o being charged with a crime via civil forfieture
*Government nationalization of business assets
*Funds frozen due to court order
*Court judgement due to child support
*Property seizure via eminent domain  


There will always be actors, both individual and collective that seek to take what others have.  It's not a conspiracy, it's human nature.


If it's centralized, the centralized controlling authority can change the rules, and will do so eventually.  I'm reminded of the book *Animal Farm* and the rules the animals wrote on the side of the barn.


This has happened before, it happens today, and it will happen again.


Yeah I don't need nor want any of that bullshit.  


It's not hypothetical--see accredited investor requirements.  I have no interest in a coin that has a central authority that can award special privileges to certain groups and blacklist others.  You seem to favor a world where government approves and allows you to act; I prefer a world where government fucks off and I do what I want.

This is correct, but imagine if gold did not have the negative properties it has.  Imagine a gold that can be transported instantly and secured with cryptography.  The reason fiat beat gold in the marketplace is because the cost of fiat (inflation, etc) is lower than the cost of gold (securing it, transporting, etc).   Bitcoin will replace gold, but then it is going to replace fiat too.  And IMO much more.


That you consider this a problem is not in any way going to keep it from happening.  I would argue that having most of the wealth owned by the top 1% is not a bad thing, but that is a separate discussion.  That you do not like this eventually is not a reason why bitcoin won't be adopted.  Might as well try to be part of that 1%, eh?

One important factor is people's perception of the uncertainty in an economy.  Suppose you knew that there was going to be a LOT of uncertainty--like 2007 levels of uncertainty in the next year.  Would you not increase your cash position?
It makes sense to have a cash position that allows you to both withstand economic disruption and take advantage of investment opportunities (by not having your capital committed).
Uncertainty is a very important element into savings equilibrium; without uncertainty, we would not need savings because we would not have error.
As to what that equilibrium point would be in an inflation-free environment...
With inflation, even a shitty investment that only returns 1-2% is preferable to simply hoarding money, but not so in a 0% situation.  ONLY investments that have an expected risk-adjusted return more than 0% are worthy of consideration for capital from a rational investor.  That and things he or she wants to consume.
Equilibrium is reached when the deflation rate reaches parity with the expected ROI for the *least* attractive investment opportunities.  There is then an adjustment for consumption because everyone has a time preference for their consumption--I would rather have one marshmallow today than one a year from now...but what about 1.05 a year from now?  There is an equilibrium point on the consumption side as well. 
If I had to guess I would say the equilibrium is about 4-5% and that is the amount your purchasing power to grow by doing nothing at all, but if you can earn 6% or 10% with a reasonable amount of risk, you would.  This is how equilibrium is reached.

I would argue this would be a *good* thing as this price increase is communicating scarcity and sending signals to produce more to the market.

The thing about economic power (and not political power) is when you use it you have less of it unless that use was profitable.  
You then have to ask the question as to whether or not being a dictator is a profitable endeavor--that is is the cost of being a dictator exceeded by the profit you can extract.   There is an avalanche of evidence and thought experiments that would say  this is certainly not a profitable activity.
That is a wealthy dictator might stay in power by using his hoard of bitcoin to retain control, but the more he does the more his bitcoin stash dwindles.  That is why almost all dictators require control of the money supply (and the ability to create new currency units) to sustain their regime

That Bitcoins are identifiable is a defense against fractional reserve.  If people collectively see bitcoin as having more value when  they treat them all the same, then they simply will do so.

I love how I come to this thread expecting the top comment to be some utterly asinine regurgitated Keynesian garbage from someone who has no clue how an economic system works, and then I find this gem and am not disappointed.  


I prefer a currency that does hold value over the long term, so why don't you keep using your shitty inflationary hot-potato money, and I'll keep using Bitcoin.


That sounds like a shitty currency to me.  I want a currency that does store its value securely over time. 


This is a fairly unimportant monetary property.  I would prefer a currency that has a limited supply and a little friction to some garbage money that has unlimited supply and lower friction.


And yet Bitcoin is still here steadily growing and telling you to go fuck yourself.

I understand this is the absurd lie they tell little sheep cucks like yourself so they can fleece you without you getting angry.  




That's not the fucking point.  First off, it is immoral and wrong to take things from people without their consent.  I did not consent to giving any of these banks a loan so it doesn't fucking matter if they paid it back.  Also, how the fuck do you think the interest rate is justified for the underlying risk.  If the companies were in a position where they could demonstrate lending to them was low risk they should have no problem procuring capital willingly from the market at an appropriate rate.
But now bitcoin exists so I don't really give a fuck what you people do.  Let them fuck you in your sheep ass again while they tell you it is necessary to stop the bleeding.  
Let them expand the monetary supply to the point the dollar is worthless while you sit there and bah "Inflation is good!  Inflation is good!".  It's not my problem anymore.  At some point some of you Down Syndrome having sheep will realize they aren't acting in your best interest and will also choose to exist the circus.

I don't think spending is important.  In historical situations where currencies die, their spending remains strong as they become completely worthless.
If you have good and bad currencies competing in the market, you should expect rational people want to SAVE the good money and SPEND the bad money.  This is what happens every time--the pre-1964 silver coins being driven out of the market is a good example.  Why would you spend deflationary Bitcoin as long as people will accept inflationary junk money instead?

No they didn't.  They put their money (and people stupid enough to let them manage their capital) at risk.  Then they lost BIGLY by taking stupid positions on which they miscategorized risk. 
Too fucking bad.  That should have been the end of it.  It would have been a FINANCIAL crisis for them, and people who were in a such a precarious liquidity position as to be dependent on being able to borrow....but too fucking bad for them too.
Without a bailout, there would have been a giant flushing of people who poorly managed capital down the toilet of economic power and a lot of room to grow for people better positioned. 
But what actually happened is the financially irresponsible wealthy had their losses mitigated by money taken form other people and redistributed to them and the dumbfuck american people were told if they didn't bailout the banks and autos, it would have been MUCH WORSE.

If ownership is controlled by a governing body, that means the governing body can "adjust" the ledger as they see fit.  You may think you own **Coin 2** until you get sued, or your government decides to seize your funds perhaps even without charging you with a crime.  Or perhaps they make up some bullshit crime to take your **coin 2**, or they find a way to "help you" with an automatic taxing algorithm encoded into the system.  Or they decide upon **coin 2** becoming valuable that they should grant themselves some more of these to increase supply so it "grows with the economy"


Also, can be stolen due to centralized system. You can secure **Coin 1** with encryption against thieves, but you can't secure them against those who control the centralized system.  It's like playing monopoly and letting someone else "be the banker".  They promise they won't cheat, but they always manage to slip themselves a $500 when they find themselves in a position of really needing it.


Can someone explain what the fuck this means?  I suppose money is a lot like religion; if faith is a key element of the equation it's probably full of shit.

Governments have a very good track record of banning or attacking centralized entities.  They can easily attack companies, individual people, other governments, etc.  e.g. they can kill a Napster no problem.
Governments have an exceptionally bad track record of attacking or banning decentralized or distributed entities.  Look at government efforts against drugs, religion, entities like BitTorrent, etc.
In addition to this, governments have a very poor track record when they try to oppose market forces with political or military force--while they may succeed in the short term, in the long run it seems economic forces win the contest.  Examples are the dollarization of Equator, any government that failed to keep its currency from collapsing with capital controls, etc.  AND NOTE: Bitcoin is far more resistant to capital controls than any other currency.  
All that said, Bitcoin does not have a very large attack surface--so I honestly don't know that there are any avenues that a government can attack bitcoin that won't likely involve in the attack backfiring spectacularly.

What does this mean?  Of course one dollar scales with debt obligation denominated in dollars.  It doesn't scale with everything else from gold to labor, etc.  This is a meaningless statement like "1 doge = 1 doge".  The problems, and there are many, is that the amount of your government obligation/extortion has spiraled out of control. Government consumes more and more resources and part of the cost is covered by the creation of new currency that is added to the money supply--e..g when a new dollar is created someone benefits, specifically the entities that are closest to the money creation.
There are two sides to prices, the money side and the product side.  On the money side, the supply of dollars has grown greatly and this causes prices to rise--as they are more dollars.  On the product side, people have become much more efficient and productive and cost have declined as a result.  The NET some of these two factors is what many people call "price inflation".  On one hand you have market forces working to deliver cheaper and better goods &amp; services to everyone and on the other hand you have government exploiting their control over the currency via seigniorage.


The current system certainly does provide an incentive to lend beyond what there would normally be in the market.  Is this a good thing?  Even if you think it is (it isn't), it provides an unfair advantage to banks that are able to profit from the creation and subsequent lending of these new dollars.  You and I are not allowed to do this, but they are--that's wrong.  People still bought houses &amp; made other investments before fractional reserve banking and they will continue to do so after Bitcoin renders FRB non-viable.


Then you should position yourself to collect the dividends!  It will also drive the COST of goods and services down in such a way that a fixed amount of human effort and labor is able to allow for (or afford) more and more resource consumption

If you can't convince me that something is worth me contributing to, then perhaps the project isn't worthwhile.  Using violence to take my money or property, or to force me to work against my will is immoral.

no one is entitled to a job.  If you work for a company that mismanages itself into bankruptcy, that is just how the cookie crumbles.  When companies fail, if there is a legitimate market need other actors will move to meet that need, often by expansion which would replace shitty poorly managed and poorly capitalized companies with ones that do a better job.


No offence, but are you completely fucking retarded?

I think it is intentionally defined in such a way as to be misleading.  By maliciously conflating change in prices to inflation you hide to what extent monetary inflation devalues currency.
Suppose there were no monetary inflation.  Prices of Goods and services would not just remain flat they would decrease as a result of technology and productivity improvements.  By mixing these two terms together it deceptively convinces people that inflation is only 2-3 percent.  The reality is it is probably closer to 5-6 with productivity gains mitigating that price increase to 2-3 percent on average.
I look forward to a world in which monetary inflation is no longer a thing and people's currency retains its value.

This is correct, but this is actually very good for the economy and you are woefully ignorant of the tremendous benefits of hoarding currency.


Who the fuck put you in charge of deciding what a currency is "intended" for?   You need to stop trying to dictate what you think money's utility to the market is and instead look at what people actually use currencies for and what they have used them for historically.

Not sure how credit will work in a Bitcoin economy.

The interesting thing about risk--if it is a legitimate risk, will *eventually* bite you in the ass.
Many people may think counter party risk isn't a problem, and may favor a coin that is *"Backed"* by a hotel, or gold, or whatever.  If this counter party risk coin becomes valuable, there will be a HUGE economic incentive to exploit that risk--e.g. a bounty for breaking that counter party link, and eventually that *will* happen.  When it does, either A) People will start to value a coin without this risk or B) those who do will have their economic power grow whereas those that stay in counter party risk land will lose power until they are irrelevant

One example is in a period of uncertainty.  When an entity holds cash, that person has two very important benefits.
1- They are able to absorb damage &amp; business disruptions that would otherwise result in a critical failure.  E.g. if your house burns down you're less fucked if you have a cash reserve that let's you recover.
2- They are better positioned to take advantage of investment opportunities as they have not committed their capital.  
These advantages are true on both the individual and cooperate level, but also on the more broad economy level.  A society or period in time that has more people sitting on higher amount of cash reserves are better able to withstand and recover from economic disruptions.  One reason the 2007 housing crisis was such a disaster was because there were insufficient entities with cash reserves that were able to come in and purchase distressed assets in what was in effect a massive liquidity crunch.

if this new executive is more protective (or less intrusive) to individual and property rights of people than the alternative then it is a good thing whether he comes to power through election, appointment, or military coup.

I am aware of the claims and arguments why savings is bad.  They are nonsensical to me.
Just reason it out for yourself.  Saving is basically deferred consumption.  Are you actually claiming that a society in which people are more cautious and reluctant to consuming resources are going to be LESS productive than one that is more flippant about it?
In situations where inflation is really high, people have an incentive to get rid of their currency very quickly; needless to say this does not make their use of economic resources more efficient.

What you should do, and what you would do if you were not a comical cartoon-like idiot, is observe what people actually use money for, and what properties successful currencies have. 
You would then be able to see that by having a strictly limited supply Bitcoin is far superior to all other currencies.  You would then be able to clearly see how competition between Bitcoin and fiat/gold.

Definitions and semantics are only useful in so far as they help us make sense of actual conditions.  It seems we are in agreement on what the actual conditions are but disagree on semantics, which is a pointless disagreement.  What do you consider to be the inflation rate of gold starting in 1492?  
Do you believe the supply of gold currency to have spiked when the vast amounts of previously unknown gold were discovered?  Or do you consider this the inflation spike only happened as the ships arrived in Europe?  Or was there no spike at all because that gold was still there?  Your answer does not really matter as it is a mere semantic.  The point I am trying to make is that price action seems to be completely blind to future known increases (and decreases) to monetary supply and the market does not in any way rationally discount current prices of money for future known supply changes.  Prices changes only occur after the monetary supply disruption has rippled through the economy.


There are all sorts of factors going on.  What we can do is try to look at past examples and normalize the variables.  I've looked at historical situations where a major money supply change is known to the market in advance and it seems to consistently be the case that the market acts as though it is blind to the future and fails to discount the price of money to adequately account for known future supply changes. 


And what are dollars measured in?  All currencies are measured in terms of their relative purchasing power.  It is convenient to measure Bitcoin's purchasing power in terms of dollars because the dollar's purchasing power has been more consistent.  This will continue to be the case until it's not.


Only because this math is a shortcut to doing their real calculation  which is necessarily in terms of purchasing power.


I think i disagree here.  Once the market "feels" the currency supply change ripple through the economy, it seems to react very quickly.  This was certainly the case with gold in the 1500s, USD under Volker's chairmanship, and the previous halvenings.  This seems to also be the case with hyperinflation or perhaps more accurately de-monitization of soft currencies.


This is an entirely different discussion, but my opinion is that Bitcoin cannot be a bubble that pops, at least in the sense that we mean when we refer to all other economic "bubbles".  That is, I think a bubble must have a couple of very important factors that Bitcoin does not have--and *cannot* have.

There is no guarantee that a person who does not borrow and has 100% of their money in government fiat will be able to protect their finances from utter destruction.   Everyone saying don't borrow money to "gamble" on bitcoin seems to be making two very wrong assumptions
* 1- US Dollars are "safe" and you can't lose money by holding them
* 2- Investing in Bitcoin is a gamble e.g. the outcome is essentially random or a game of chance.
Also, investors do this sort of thing all the time--look at the forex markets for example.


My argument is that it is not reckless.  You should understand what you are doing though.  I agree many people investing in bitcoin do not understand it and may very well lose money because they are not confident or complete in their understanding of money.  IF someone does look at Bitcoin and concludes that for the past 8 years a superior currency has been gaining market share against shitty currencies, AND that there is nothing that can stop it from continuing to compete and win against them, then it is prudent to borrow debt denominated in those shitty currencies to buy the superior one.


Then you should be telling people not to invest based on reactionary emotion--but this also includes not holding dollars because they're "backed by the full faith and credit blah blah blah".  People should know what they are doing when they invest, but if they do, it is reasonable for them to take on debt as part of their calculated strategy.


Bitcoin's success does not depend on market confidence.  You people can sell for all I care.  I've been here for 4 years and never once posted a "HODL" meme or advertised that I'm going to get "cheap coins" from the "weak hands".  I don't give a shit because I understand it doesn't matter.
I see it more of an issue of USD/EUR/Gold/etc are *going* to lose their purchasing power and Bitcoin is the *only* safe investment I can think of besides *maybe* real estate, though there is a chance bitcoin might eat that too.
I see the situation as Bitcoin vs everything else, and I see this situation as *very* risky for everything else.

Thank you for your kind words.  I've spent a lot of time studying monetary economics and the history of money.  I think I have a correct understanding of money and consider almost everyone else way off and drawing all sorts of wrong and even absurd conclusions.
That said, it looks like we disagree on the future of Bitcoin.  I think bitcoin is being adopted but not in the way most people think.  A lot of people think people "use" a currency when they buy something.  And they then go about worrying a great deal when people "use" bitcoin.
This is not what people do with currency.  A person begins using currency when he accepts it and continues using it while he holds it.  When a person sells the currency he ceases his use of it.  We can therefore look at if people are increasingly using bitcoin.  A look at the price growth since inception indicates they are.  Which is exactly what I would expect with one of my core monetary thesis being that when hard and soft money compete the hard money will always win (see thiers' law and grishams law).
Basically I think it is 100% certain that Bitcoin will grow and replace all other currencies because it is far harder than any other money and it has a far superior central bank to all other currencies.  Imagine bitcoin as a tiny nation whose central bank sets interest rates to infinity percent and refuses to be a lender of last resort or increase the supply.  Such a currency would be far better protected form seignoirage than other inferior currencies, and as such would grow to complete global dominance

This question annoys me and I see it more of how an idiot imagines an economy works but certainly does not align with how people behave with money. 
First, people can TODAY take their money and invest it in risk-free assets that will increase their purchasing power allowing them to buy more later.  It is as if these morons think that one little intermediate step is preventing people from stopping all buying.  It makes no sense.
Secondly, time is deflationary.  Given the choice of buying 1 million hookers when I turn 70 or 1-2 a week *now*, I am going to chose the latter option because I am willing to sacrifice buying some buying power to get what I want now rather than having to wait.


YES, this is also true.  If you have a valuable money, people are going to want to work harder to earn more if it.  Investments that offer a risk-adjusted ROI greater than 0 would also attract capital and lower quality investments would not.

We are on the edge of the greatest shift in economic power in the history of the world.  You would do well to fully understand monetary economics before the hyperbitcoinization occurs.  I don't think we have much time left.
To sum up my argument, I would say that the economic moat around bitcoin is **VASTLY** larger than people think and it would take a tremendous amount of effort to shift consensus to a non-bitcoin cryptocurrency.  In the absence of substantial advantages there is nothing that will drive this effort as market forces will act to reinforce bitcoin's use as a currency until it becomes a monopoly.

If you think it is arbitrary you don't fully understand the situation.  I recall an article on money that I read once that said something to the effect of "show me a society and I will show you the money they use", meaning by this that if the general economic conditions are known, the money they will use can be known with reliable certainty.


May I suggest to you that money is a social behavior--that is a society using an agreed upon ledger as an accounting tool, and that the market will drive the society to use the best available ledger--google "Yap Stones".


This attack vector would certainly fail due as difficulty adjusts.
 


Correct.  That is my belief.
 


Originally I thought this was a risk--how can we know bitcoin will be the winner?  After careful study of monetary history and some excellent articles over at the nakamoto institute (check out the ones on Alt Coins) it boils down to bitcoin's multiple network advantages being insurmountable.  Another great point in some literature I read was that society selecting which ledger to use is a form of consensus.  Consider the GIANT paint in the ass consensus on adopting segwit, achieving economic consensus for everyone to switch to BCH, Etherum, or Dogecoin, would be WAY more difficult than that.  It is an insurmountable wall.


Lol.  Governments can go fuck themselves.  If government were a legitimate threat to bitcoin, then Bitcoin would be worthless because *eventually* government would and will move in and attempt to kill it.  Bitcoin is extremely resistant and when government does try to attack bitcoin its properties will act to lure government actors away--it's like a salt golem trying to fight water.
When government and bitcoin finally clash it is going to be the end of government as we know it.  I'm super excited.


Well I suppose they can try.   Of course they would 100% fail, as consensus is a *really* tough wall to climb.  The question you should really do some deep searching on is who (what group) controls bitcoin.

These people are fucking retarded.  Why are you trying to reason with them?
One important point about the boom/bust cycle is that--as far as I can tell every other other asset bubble involves the spike in price sending triggers to the market to produce more of that underlying thing whatever it is.  This creates a situation when at some point a wave of excess created supply is dumped onto the market--this is what kills the so-called bubble.  Im not even sure if you can have bubbles without this important element.  Bitcoin drops in price and will again, but it sure doesn't behave like a bubble by roaring back with vengeance 2-3 years later

It is also helpful to list out the possible ways bitcoin *could* fail and analyze each of them.  But in short, bitcoin has near-perfect monetary properties that put it head-and-shoulders above other non-crypto currencies when it comes to usefulness as money.  
We can look to many examples of where currencies of the past came into competition with one another and we can conclude that the one with the better monetary properties drives out the other weaker currencies.  I think the name for this is Thiel's law but I can look it up if you are interested.  People see "Safe" US dollars and "Risk" Bitcoin--they see a "David and Goliath" situation, and so do I.  It's just most people get the "David and Goliath" story wrong.

No one does this because they only have shitty currencies that lose value.  Now people have a new option that does allow them to hoard currency as is the purpose and function of currency.  Money does not need to "flow" from person to person to create value for the individual or the economy as a whole.  It is good for individuals to hold currencies (provided they cannot be devalued via inflation) and good for the economy as well.


Certainly some people are insanely more affluent because of central banks but not most of us.  The affluence many of us have is a result of productivity and technological improvements that come from a market economy despite much of this being siphoned away via inflation.  We now have a new currency that allows us to avoid this shitty monetary devaluation and poor credit/lending decisions made by others who can shift the risk to others with political power.

I understand the concept of money multiplier.  Money being spent does by definition cause economic activity but this is not necessarily productive.  It could just be the destruction of resources--that's not growth.


What do you mean by taking out of the economy?  It isn't like the money is burned; it still exist and in doing so signals to the economy a reserve and allows for more risk taking--similar to how you having more cash on hand might allow you to drop your insurance coverage or invest in some future opportunity should it come along.


Money bouncing around from person to person does not create anything of value.  Which creates more value:
1-	People spending $1000 at a strip club, which then gets spent again to a drug dealer, which then gets spent again modifying some shitty car, which then gets spent again at a bar?
2-	People holding that $1000 to establish an emergency fund for themselves?


Mostly agree here.  In an deflationary economy it would not make sense to perpetually save with the idea of spending it all at the very end of life.  Deflation/inflation just shifts the time preference to favor deferred consumption and productive (or above average) investment.

I think we might assess risk differently.  I do so by trying to picture the ways something can fail, to what degree they would in such a case, and how likely that case would be to occur. 
I do not consider volatility to be a risk (though it would bring liquidity risk, perhaps if you are borrowing).
I see people pointing to things they think are risk to bitcoin but have determined them to be non-issues.  Like government shutting bitcoin down....yeah sure, good luck with that. 
Conversely, I see a lot of risk where others see safety e.g. US dollars in a savings account.  
To me gambling is betting on chance/random outcomes.  If I bet $20 on a slot machine thats gambling.  If i bet a large amount on after extensive analysis, that's a calculated investment risk.
Also, real estate investing is not always risky, you can find low risk high return deals they are just rare.

That definition is shared by others--specifically those in the Austrian school of economics.  If you dig deeper you will find there are two terms one called "monetary inflation" the other called "price inflation".  It is really annoying how these items are labeled because it makes it super confusing to people who do not understand economics (like Keynesians) 
Inflation is the best term for the increase in the money supply and I think using this term to include things like price increases from other sources is at best useless but more likely intentionally deceiving.

People with cash are able to remain agnostic as to what they want to buy until the very last moment. They are more prepared for unexpected expenses and opportunities, and therefore free from the need to plan. A person with savings can treat as ordinary expenses things that would be disasters for people who didn’t have savings. Most people, if they have a big enough income, would choose to buy insurance for their car, home, or health. But someone with a lot of savings doesn’t need as much help from other people.
He is also more in a position to help other people who have been struck with disaster. Not only is he in a position to be nice if people should need help, but he is also in a position to profit from doing so. A business has certain expenses that it must make regularly or go out of business. It must make payroll, for example. There is always some risk that the company will not have enough revenue for some time. The company could reduce this risk by holding extra cash, or it could use the cash to buy more capital and attempt to expand its future production. It is difficult to maintain the right balance because circumstances are constantly changing and uncertain, so even fundamentally sound businesses sometimes end up in an immediate need for cash. When that happens the business’s stock price goes down because their risk of insolvency goes up. They may also be willing to take out a loan at a very favorable rate for the lender. An investor with cash on hand can help an otherwise worthwhile business survive by taking care of their immediate expenses and in return can buy the stock at a good value or earn a good rate of interest off a bond.
However, this kind of opportunity does not last forever. Investors who have cash get first dibs on it. When one is in cash, one is uncommitted and ready for opportunity. By contrast, a lot of the potential value of an investment depends on being able to choose when to sell it. A given investment can always go down for a while, even if the investor ultimately is able to sell it at a profit. An investment has a much better chance of being valuable if the investor can expect to hold it long enough that a good selling opportunity will have occurred. Furthermore, although on ordinary days it may seem as if a stock will be easy to sell at any time, there are days when most investments other than cash drop at the same time. During these days it may not be possible to sell investments fast enough and it is much better to have cash on hand in the first place.
Thus, a cash-holder benefits himself by being prepared to take advantage of the best deals, and provides the corresponding benefit to the economy of being prepared to jump in where help is needed. The cash-holders benefit the economy by deciding which troubled businesses can be redeemed and then providing the necessary cash.
Of course, it is not the cash itself that fixes the troubled business. The cash is used to buy the necessary resources to do so. For example, it could be used to pay employees to keep them working until some new revenue comes in. Thus, the existence of cash-holders in an economy can be thought of as meaning that some fraction of the economy’s production is reserved to be diverted to error correction.
A cash-holder can live idly and can avoid making investments. It would be a mistake to look at this person and say that he is not contributing anything. The ability to live idly is also an ability to become committed at any time, to whatever has the greatest need. People depend on this service because it is impossible to avoid error, and insofar as everyone in the economy depends on everyone else, we are all subject to one another's’ errors.
A person who is uncommitted cannot step in to fix every problem that might arise. Eventually he will be committed himself and can take on no additional projects. Therefore, if there is a lot of money held in cash, then there is a lot of tolerance for error in the economy, whereas if there is little, then the economy is much less error-tolerant. Thus, the problem of overinvestment is a reduced capacity for error-correction. If everyone decides to put their money to work now, then theoretically more can be accomplished at once, but at a much greater risk of failure. If a lot of cash-holders remain on the sidelines, then less can be ventured, but at a greater probability of success.
Because an error in one business can affect the businesses that depend on it, then when people are overinvested, not only is there a greater risk of error, but the consequences of errors are more severe. For example, suppose that two businesses, A and B, both make short-term errors that require correction. In a healthy economy, maybe one or the other would have failed, but the other would have been rescued, whereas in an overinvested economy, both fail. Now suppose that business C can tolerate either A or B failing to follow through on a deal, but not both. Then C also needs to be rescued. However, it too evidently fails as well.
Thus, it is possible, in an overinvested economy, for a small error to turn into a big error because there is no one prepared to fix it while it is small. This is an economic crash. When too many people become invested and not enough remain uncommitted, then everyone in the economy must move in lock-step with one another. In a healthy economy, there is a lot more room for everybody screw up.

 &gt;That is the "electricity" of a functioning economy. That's what makes it run. People buying goods (or investing in things). Buying goods generates profits.

**False** 


**False**  The idea that people's currency increasing in value is a BAD thing is bullshit told by people who benefit from inflation or believed by those who don't know any better.


And yet it is working very well...




A currency without demand will not have liquidity and therefore will not be useful.  The only reason currencies have value is because people are willing to invest in (or hold) them.

I would recommend spending a good amount of time researching the history of money.  In order to understand how bitcoin is going to compete and why it is going to win, you must first understand what drives a currency to become more valuable than others--specifically what properties would an ideal money have?


This is something i considered when I first looked seriously into Bitcoin.  Why buy bitcoin when it can just be replaced by Bitcoin 2.0 causing bitcoin to lose all value?
I eventually came to the following conclusion.
* Bitcoin seems to be perfect money--That is, it is difficult for me to even imagine a way a currency could have better monetary properties than bitcoin already has.  Can you think of an advantage another currency could have over bitcoin?  I cannot.
* If this were the case, Bitcoin could fork and change to copy the new features with the same block history.
* We don't really see this in currencies as money is a market that favors a natural monopoly.  Gold doesn't get replaced by Silver for example.
One more piece of advice.  Understand your reasons for buying to the point you have sufficient confidence to weather short-mid term price fluctuation.  I only know the end result--that Bitcoin will destroy all other currencies.  I do not know what path it will take to get there, but im pretty sure it isnt going to be a smooth steady one.   It might get pretty rough--it probably will.

There are many areas where this is not the case.  An Uber driver can drive for Lift with very little additional cost or effort.  A facebook user can have Google Plus without any real penalty.

FRB does not magically create new resources.  Society still has the same amount of resources, the only difference is how those resources are used.
You seem to be claiming that people would be more productive and resources better utilized under an FRB system.  Consider that money is really only a system of accounting.  Why do you think people would be more efficient with a ledger that some people can edit and expand while others cannot vs one that has no special privilege and a known quantity?
Demanding more ROI means higher productivity and less wasted investment.   The sheer number of investments is not the correct metric to look at.  Some investments actually destroy value.  Capital should go to the "best" investments for maximum productivity.

I don't want to get into a semantic argument so im not going to argue over what the proper definition of inflation is.
When I personally use the term inflation I mean it ONLY to be the expansion of the money supply and this would be independent of price action.  All things being equal an increase in money supply would make prices rise; however, prices may fall due to productivity increases--e.g. TVs, consumer electronics, etc.
My definition of inflation is internal to the money itself and does not factor in external factors that may also effect price.  
I think your definition renders it useless because it is an umbrella term that groups so many different factors.  To call a price increase due to a commodity shortage, increased demand, or an increase in the money supply the same thing makes no sense as these are VERY different things.
A lot of people will claim we have inflation around 2-3%.  That's bullshit.  What we have is a much greater expansion of the money supply and also at the same time productivity gains.  Lets say companies are being able to produce goods ~3-4% cheaper every year do to gains in manufacturing or technology improvements, and then the ALSO completely separate from this the amount of US dollars is increasing by 6-7%.  The NET aggregate price increase may be around 2-3% but to call this inflation is fucking retarded because it renders the term meaningless.
My guess is these are all grouped together because it helps hide the true cost of inflation.  If you define inflation this way, you need to break it up into the sub-components.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:53:34


I would argue that the moon is what gets us there.  The reason Bitcoin is far more valuable than Dogecoin is almost entirely because demand for Bitcoin is far higher.  Demand is the main thing that separates Bitcoin from whatever shitcoin which may have only minor differences.
What better way to judge the success of bitcoin than to measure how much demand there is for it?  And what better way to measure that demand than price?
I would argue that it is necessarily the case that Bitcoin *IS* much more valuable now than it was last year because of price.  This is the reason why Bitcoin has a much more stable price, as it is harder to move a $70 billion currency than a tiny one due to liquidity.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:14:40
First off measuring economic output by consumption is a shitty way to measure economic output.
Secondly this is how people imagine spending behavior would play out but as far as I can tell it is not based on reality or actual data.  I do think people would be much more demanding of their investments as saving would become more attractive.  They would as well reduce consumption.  How can you possible see a reduction in the consumption of resources to be a bad thing?
Thirdly equilibrium would be reached where the risk adjusted return demanded from investing would be roughly equal to the deflation rate.  That is--people would be much less susceptible to malinvestment. 
The new equilibrium would be one that encourages differed resource consumption and discourages unnecessary spending or poor investments

Completely agree with paragraph one but I think it is reasonable to conclude 2 cannot replace one.  If it can I would get out of crypto all together.
Disagree on paragraph 2.  The network effect is huge and it is the only thing that protects 1 from 2.  If this effect is shown to be a small enough gap that it can be overcome  I think 2 is at more risk of then being overtaken by 3.
In other examples it seems a  currency much have a lot of advantages over 1 to overtake it

This is not what gives currency value.  Figuring this out would not even take a modicum of intelligence just a mere ability to reason things out logically or preform a simple thought experiment.  Also gold isnt used to pay taxes and it still holds value.  Bitcoin isnt used to pay taxes and it keeps soaring in value.


And yet they still have value and use.  Currency has existed long before taxes.








If those are not important intrinsic monetary properties.  Bitcoin has super, and I would even argue near-perfect intrinsic monetary properties.  As such it will continue to compete with and gain market share against other currencies.

Markets and the underlying economic condition are not stable, so then why would you expect a currency to be?  It is far better to have a flexible unstable currency that can adjust to an unstable market.  If you try to force stability on an unstable market, you're going to have a bad time

You need to get a better understanding of what makes money useful, and what monetary properties make one currency preferable to others.  You need to stop thinking about what a currency "should be" and look to examples of money in the past.
Until you can understand and articulate why currencies like [this]( emerged as the dominate form of money in their economies you need to do more research. 
You also need to get a better understanding of what inflation is.  To define inflation/deflation as its relative price change to other goods/services renders this definition meaningless.  Prices change all the time for all sorts of reasons.  If it becomes cheaper to make a computer, that doesn't mean your money has deflated.  If gas prices go up due to an oil shortage that does not mean your money has inflated.  


That's not my goal.  My goal is to get rich and secure my wealth.  Ask yourself does the market really need a new way to pay everyday bills or buy mundane things?  I already have this and it works very well.
You know what I don't have--Sound money.  I don't have a way to secure what I earn with a currency that 1) is supply constrained and 2) that I control.  There is NOTHING on the market that adequately meets this need.  You might say gold, but gold is shitty.  The supply is somewhat constrained but not really, it is a pain-in-the-ass to secure, transfer, or authenticate.  
A lot of people claim money needs to do 3 things 
* Store of Value
* Medium of exchange
* Unit of account
But to me it seems like  and  are both natural extensions of  and that  is the only thing that really matters.  In other words if you have  you will necessarily get  &amp;  how gold turned into paper money via fiduciary media.  If you DON'T have   and  are completely useless.  
The BEST money is the money everyone wants to own.


This is a poor reason to invest.  This is mere speculation.  If you hold this view of Bitcoin, I recommend you sell.  For me, I think Bitcoin is a sure thing--that is to say I believe it's outcome as the dominant currency that is worth more than all other currencies is inevitable.  How can we know this?  We can look at past examples of currency competition and gain an understanding of what monetary properties are needed.  With net-gold being worth $8T even though it is a poor medium of exchange, we can conclude that is not a super important property.  I will link to an article below that articulates why Bitcoin is vastly superior to all other currencies when it comes to its monetary properties.
We can then project what happens when a new superior money comes into competition with many, many weak currencies.  The outcome should be clear to anyone but I understand many do not see it this way.  In ANY CASE if we look far enough into the future we can see the eventual outcome of a deflationary currency competing against inflationary ones; however, I think this end result of Bitcoin being worth infinity units of all inflationary currencies will occur much sooner than everyone things.  Hope that helps.

Currencies do not exist in a vacuum and there may be other forces or noise that act upon price, but strictly speaking Dogecoin at a 200M marketcap is more useful than Dogecoin at a 2M mc.  Also I should point out that I think a lot of the reported marketcaps are misleading especially ones like Ripple which have such a large portion of their supply locked up as to make it difficult to assess their real market demand.
I'm not sure I would consider ICOs a currency.  My understanding is they have another end use or some utility with the idea being they will eventually be used for this utility.  
As to why the price doesn't keep climbing to infinity....I think that is what is actually occurring with Bitcoin.  Of course, we cannot expect this to be a smooth or linear path, but it certainly seems to be headed in that direction and I think one factor is the feedback loop created when Bitcoin gains value its liquidity and therefore its usefulness as a money increases.  There is no equilibrium here and there cannot be.
If my monetary theory is right Bitcoin simply cannot co-exist with US dollars, Euros, or even gold (insofar as it is used as a currency).

I strong recommend reading all of the articles on that site.  As for the Keynesians or people who think currency's strength comes from how many people use it to buy coffee, i recommend just ignoring them.  The good thing about Bitcoin is hyperbitcoinization is going to happen regardless of what people think; they can all be inflation-worshiping Keynesians for all I care.
I am reminded of Plato's allegory of the cave.  You should check it out.  Basically some people love the dark, and cannot be shown the light even if we tried.  Nonetheless it is not our responsibility to bring them out of the cave.  
Instead just profit from them--the only reason we can buy bitcoin so cheap is because of how ignorant people are about money.  If they only knew...

As to your other question, I think confidence can be lost in a 2nd or 3rd layer system but retained in the base layer.
Bitcoin will ignore IP laws just as it ignores other laws.  
I believe Bitcoin is immune from government laws, if it isn't then Bitcoin would have no value, IMO.  If bitcoin is immune from law &amp; government trying to "shut it down" then it sure as hell is immune from bullshit IP laws.

It absolutely would be possible to run an economy of any size with 5 one dollar bills provided those dollars were infinitely divisible.
You don't seem to understand the economic anatomy of a commodity bubble.  I recommend more study in this area.  Once you find out bitcoin cannot possibly be a bubble you will then know you have ano adequate understanding of bubbles.
Without value being stored in a currency it has no liquidity and therefore no value.
A lot of people incorrectly claim having "too much" people saving is a bad thing.  This is nonsensical and wrong.  Savings contributes greatly to economic growth.

Blockchains are very resource intensive and expensive to run--in terms of inputs.  It does not make a lot of sense to do this to solve problems that could be more easily solved using other means.  There is one function that it makes sense to run this expensive process for and that is maintaining an immutable ledger, beyond that, I just don't see the value. 
The things you point to for ETH, could easily be done w/ 2nd layer transactions to BTC (or USD for that matter) and be done without all the cost of the ETH blockchain.  
Regarding POS, there are many issues with this type of system, and it might be worth reading up on them.  I am convinced POS could be attacked by holders of large amounts of tokens.  Also what is the value of something that you know will eventually inflate to infinite supply?
ETH IS competing with Bitcoin in the sense that they are mutually exclusive on a per unit of value basis.  That is, for ever X unit of ETH you own, you must necessarily own Y units less of BItcoin
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:25:49
This is good.  This is the type of analysis I was talking about, but I would confidently say bitcoin would shrug all of these off, and some would have no effect--like side chain risk, unless you are invisioning a very large side chain that makes up a significant amount of coins unlike anything we have today.  
As for regulator shutting down exchanges...This is where people are going to see how immune Bitcoin us to government fuckery, and when that happens I expect bitcoin will go UP in value.
You point out one concern that had me very worried until recently-


I did not expect Segwit to get activated and was seriously worried that this could impair bitcoin enough to allow another currency to overtake it, but then Bitcoin overcame this challenge like a champ.  I speculate that this resilience is why the price has gone up so much lately.  You can literally stick a fork in Bitcoin and it's not done.
In any case, now make a similar list for the US Dollar--what can cause it to fall in value.  Then compare the two lists.

If you think cash is risk-free, you aren't seeing all the risk.
There are different types of risk.  Bitcoin has volatility risk, but it is *much* safer than other currencies in other areas of risk, such as inflation, counterfeiting, or seizure.  
IMO bitcoin is the safest possible investment if your liquidity is such that you do not have a likelihood of near term need for cash.

If bitcoin CAN be destroyed then it NEEDS to be destroyed.  A currency that can be killed has no value to me and I would prefer it die sooner rather than later.
As such I consider malicious actors to be working to help improve Bitcoin.
As for Erik, I see no reason to consider him malicious and potential to HF is essential to Bitcoin's value.  Suppose Erik and the 2X crowd are right and the 1X folk are wrong?  This is possible.
But now we have the best of both worlds.  If 1X or 2X wins the economic consensus then Bitcoin lives.  It is literally win-win.  
If you are 100% confident 1X will win, then you should be very thankful for the 2X folk as you can merely sell your 2X fork and buy more 1X.  Many did this with the BCH fork.  With this one I think I will keep both coins because I do not yet know which one will win the economic consensus.

It is possible I am the "someone" in OP's post.  


This is complete nonsense.  A currency is not valuable because how often it changes hands or how frequently it is used as to facilitate a a purchase.  A currency is valuable because people want it--e.g. it's **demand**
You claim that Bitcoin's value depends on people spending it.  Let’s think about that for a minute. You are essentially telling the merchant, “Hey look at this totally awesome thing that I want to get rid of! You should trade me some stuff for it!” Not actually much of a sales pitch, is it? Why would the merchant want something that you, apparently, don’t want? If you really want him to start accepting bitcoins himself, ask him, “Do you take worthless paper money at this store?"
Right now, and probably for as long as stores *will* accept US dollars (or EUR, whatever) it makes more sense to use that money for transnational purposes.  In other words, if a merchant is willing to accept a superior deflationary currency AND an inferior inflationary one, you should definitely use the shitty currency, and keep the good one for yourself.
Read this article by Daniel Krawisz; he explains why hording what matters: 


These two statements contract each other.  Nothing is going to be worthless that has a strong demand (hording).  The reason Bitcoin's price has gone up in the last 8 years is not because it is being used to buy alpaca socks, or trinkets from NewEgg; it's going up because some people have figured out that Bitcoin is God-Money, and it makes a lot of sense to horde as much of it as possible.
Also consider that when a currency's value collapses due to hyperinflation, this does not happen as a result of people not trying to spend it.  It happens because people stop wanting the shitty currency--e.g. everyone wants to spend it, but no one wants to horde it.


No, we just have to horde it.  Actually "we" don't even have to do that.  If we don't horde it, other people will realize it's value and *they* will horde it and profit from its rise.
The idea that Bitcoin is valuable because people spend it, is poppycock.  Bitcoin is valuable because of the horders, and the horders' realization that Bitcoin is an immortal deflationary God-Money that cannot be stopped.
Spend your dollars, keep your God-Money for yourself.

You may have seen the meme that Bitcoin is the "honey badger" of money.  So you have Bitcoin this badger that has been running around growing, fighting lions, just generally being a little badass badger for 8 years.
But there's Zookeepers who have guns and most people think that pretty soon a Zookeeper is going to decide the $80 Billion Badger has to be put down, and he will go get his rifle and shoot the badger in the head.
What they don't expect is that the badger, unlike Harambe, will be found to be bulletproof and may very well maul one of the zookeepers in the process.
Bitcoin isn't a cute little badger that can be kept in a cage or put down if it gets too big.  Its an immortal god-currency that destroy every other currency in existence as well as every government whose existence depends on said underlying currencies.

I am so sick of this tired and very wrong cliche advice that keeps getting spewed about here.
First, there are plenty of instances when people rationally invest more than they can "afford to lose" such as borrowing at 4% to buy a rental property or whatever.  These can be very profitable and very safe investments if due diligence is done.  Following this cliche gimmick would have you skip out on such opportunities. 
Second, everything you invest in has risk of losing purchasing power and "not investing" is investing in something by default, probably US dollars.  Everything, including US dollars has risk.  A scenario could play out where someone chooses to keep all/most of his or her money in US instead of Bitcoin because they "can't afford to lose it", then Bitcoin goes up and the dollar's value goes to zero.  People dismiss this as not being a legitimate risk, but it is very much a legitimate and I would even argue a certainty.
Finally, Bitcoin is not risky.  Bitcoin is volatile.  Risk =/= volatility.  If you simple compare Bitcoin to fiat, there is an entire category of risk that Bitcoin does not have--inflationary risk.  Bitcoin is intrinsically immune to inflation and with proper security measures it can be secured  better than any other money.  In truth Bitcoin is the lowest risk investment one can make.

My advice to people is for them to get an understanding of money, how it works and why it is valuable real quick.  If they do this, they will go out and take on debt to buy bitcoin themselves.


If we are honest, then we will admit Bitcoin will do all of those things.  It really will reach 100k and destroy fiat and it will do so very soonish.


I am not trying to get more people to buy into bitcoin.  That is inevitable as they will have to because the other currencies are so shitty.  I argue that IF someone concludes for themselves that Bitcoin is going to compete and win against other currencies it makes sense for them to borrow in inflationary fiat to buy deflationary bitcoin....at subsidized interest rates no less! 
As for people being hurt when there is economic change, people are going to get hurt.

Sadly economics is a complex subject that is sometimes difficult to capture in even the dankest of memes.


For me, I want a money that minimizes need for trust.  With fiat currency, there is very high inflation risk, so much so that I would consider this an absolute certainty.  That is, I do not know and cannot know with certainty what the future money supply will be.  All I can know is that the supply with most certainly increase.
I want to expand on this increase because I think it is a point many people get wrong.  Inflation is not merely the expansion of the money supply like an inflating balloon.  If, practical considerations aside, everyone’s dollars grew or expanded at the same rate—e.g. the $1 you have now gradually grows to $1.03 by this time next year, this would for economic purposes be the same thing as no inflation. 
Inflation does not happen by uniform expansion, but rather by asymmetric creation of new currency.  Someone gets the new dollars that are created, and this gives them an advantage as they benefit greatly from the newly created units.  You cannot have inflation without an inflator.  That is why inflation is so bad—someone is benefiting from this money creation, and it isn’t you or me.  It’s simply unfair.


Cash and other currency is valuable because people purchase and hold it.  It does not matter whatsoever why people do this.  The idea that currency has value because everyone is sharing some collective but incorrect delusion is nonsense.  Market forces would quickly destroy illogical nonsense anyway.  Cash or money is a useful tool, and up until Bitcoin’s creation it was the most useful tool for the function it served—namely acting as an accounting ledger in respective USD/EUR/YEN/ETC markets.  Cash is better than gold because the amount of value lost due to inflation is (typically) less than the cost of storing/transporting/verifying gold and other currency competitors.  
But in 2009 a new tool was invented that does this function so much better than every other currency that one might rationally conclude that it cannot co-exist with the current currency tools on the market—that is, it will grow and grow until it eats them all.  And this is exactly what is happening, it is just taking a while because the market has never seen anything like this before and almost everyone is clueless about monetary economics.  Basically Bitcoin does everything USD/Gold/EUR/etc does better and more efficiently so we can confidently conclude its grown and eventual dominance as the world’s only money is a certainty.


Changes in purchasing power, often deceptively called “price inflation” is an abdominal creation of two very separate factors, the combination of which into one term causes an absurd amount of misunderstanding.  First there is price change due to the increase or decrease on the money supply (monetary inflation), but also a factor is whatever goods or services are being bought.  Typically, as society becomes more productive and efficient cost tend to fall—people find ways to do things cheaper or a new technology saves costs or whatever.  The 2-3% “inflation” number people spew about ad nausuem is a combination of these two price factors—the number of currency units going up and the efficiency/productivity gains of the underlying economy.   It is like adding a 2-3% reduction in price to a 4-6% increase in money supply for a net price increase (called price inflation) of 2-3%.  This naming convention is horribly dishonest, IMO. 


It is actually much worse if you back out the productivity gains I mentioned above.  Inflation is a real bastard that inflicts a great deal of harm on the economy to the benefit of those politically favored entities that benefit from the creation of new currency units—e.g. the inflator. 


Ultimately I think a currency SHOULD fluctuate in value to reflect the market conditions on the productivity or goods/services side of the equation.  If conditions are good and people are making things more and more efficiently, prices should fall.  If a meteor hits and cost of production goes up, things should become more expensive.   As for Bitcoin specifically, we can know the purchasing power will increase because it is competing with vastly inferior currency competitors, so obviously it is going to gain market share until it has 100%.




Bitcoin is different in many ways.  
First, the supply is truly fixed so there is a lot of risk you don’t have to worry about—most notably the value inflating away as the inflator creates more currency for himself.  
Secondly, Bitcoin is decentralized, immutable, uncontrollable, and immortal.  The fact that no government or powerful group can successfully conspire to edit, stop, or kill bitcoin means you DON’T have to trust it.  By design it is immune to those that would seek to have an unfair advantage or privileged control.  
3rd, Bitcoin is fair easier to secure &amp; transport.  With good Opsec, not enough government can seize your money—that’s fucking powerful!  No other money can do that.
Lastly, there are other areas bitcoin demonstrates its superior monetary policy.  I recommend this article if you want to learn more:

News Flash: It is possible to lose money when investing.
* When you buy bitcoin, if you have ANY DEBT AT ALL, you are effectively borrowing to buy bitcoin.
* But borrowing to buy bitcoin is a VERY PRUDENT MOVE.  When you can take on debt in an inflationary currency to buy a deflationary currency, you do this--or at least you should.  ESPECIALLY when interest rates are artificially low.  
* It is annoying for people to dismiss a calculated investment in bitcoin based on sound economic analysis and sound monetary theory as "gambling".  If you look at the past 9 years of Bitcoin price action and see a slot machine you're a goddamn idiot.  It should be painfully obvious to anyone what is going on here--a currency with vastly superior monetary properties is gaining market share against shitty currencies.  
* But, but, but...you could LOSE money.  No fucking shit, bucko.  The world is a dangerous place and you can lose money investing.  You can also lose money not investing.  You can sit on your US dollars because herr derp, they're "safe" and still lose money because unexpected (to you) inflation erodes their value.  
* Investing in bitcoin or borrowing to do so may not be for you, but GTFO telling people they are stupid or foolish for doing so.  MAYBE THEY SEE SOMETHING YOU DON'T.
* Lastly, forex markets do this all the time.  Look up USD-YEN Carry Trade.  Go tell those investors who made a ton of $$$ from exploiting artificially low interest rates how stupid they are.

I don't think you understand money.  Money is useful as an accounting system.  The demand to use on accounting system over another is what makes that currency valuable--it is NOT valuable because a lot of transactions occur on the system in question.

Because I'm in a super nice mood I will answer your questions


* The supply is controlled by the algorithm or rules that are agreed upon by the bitcoin users.  Your comment seems to suggest this is a problem, I disagree.  A limited and predictable supply is very much superior to an unlimited and unpredictable supply vis-a-vis fiat currency.  It is a myth than the supply of a currency must increase for it to be useful; in fact, I prefer one that does not increase.


If you need liquidity in the next 2 yrs you should limit your investment in Bitcoin to mitigate this risk.  This is a specific risk that is correlated with time.  I think Bitcoin is a very safe investment for longer terms, but for shorter terms it is obviously  due to volatility.


 
* Money is a mutually agreed upon system for accounting.  That's all it is really.  The software can be duplicated but the consensus cannot.  The strength of the consensus is reflected by the $100B "market cap" price of bitcoin.  It is the consensus that makes Bitcoin a valuable money, not the technology and it cannot be easily replicated.

Inflation certainly does benefit debt holders.  But it also greatly benefits those who create money.  If all money just expanded equally--e.g. your $1 gradually became $1.02 over the course of a year, it would be the same effectual situation as no inflation.  It's only inflation because someone else is getting the extra 2%.  And that someone isn't you.

Volatility COULD be a risk depending on if your investment timeline is short.  In a timeline of 5 yrs or more, Bitcoin is an almost certainty with very low risk.

It is more profitable to have dormant savings than invested ones right now because some investments are shitty investments. What I am claiming is that dormant savings as you call them serve a vital function and are critical to the health and growth of the economy.  Also the profitability of dormant savings is nothing to worry about.


There are other ways of financing projects other than debt or inflation.  A balanced budget with healthy reserves is one way, but that requires good budget management.






Your understanding is wrong, there have been example of societies that have been successful and managed their budget with little or no debt.  Of course this always seems to eventually lead to a situation where budget controls are relaxed debt incurred and in many cases there are severe negative consequences, but it is definitely possible for a society to live within its means.

Gold, for example, has a price that is made up partially 1) its utility value and 2) its use as a store of value.  For gold almost all of the value is from  with only &lt;10% from   For reference dollars and bitcoin have ~100% of their price from 
Let's call this principle currency entanglement.  That is when a good or commodity has its price become disconnected from its utility price because people are using it as a store of value.
So a stock, would likely be very resistant to this entanglement and would likely have ~100% of its price come form  (utility).  Real estate though, seems to frequently be used as a store of value.  In other words real estate seems to me to have a degree of currency entanglement to the point that houses are not valued as a sum of their future expected rents less expenses, like they would be if they were valued exclusively for their utility.  It seems to me there is an additional premium on top of this value that comes from  real estate's use as a store of value. 
If Bitcoin becomes the global dominate currency like i expect it will, people will have a very easy and secure way to store their value and the price premium real estate has from  --which is probably around 10% but maybe more in some markets, will decline and prices should align with the value of their utility (
Now if after reading this you think Im a crazy person, you should note that in situations where a currency collapses but land property rights protection remains secure, land/houses gain a very significant premium until the currency crisis abates and prices adjust back to what they were.

I bought bitcoin over the past 3 years while I also bought a house.  In particular I chose to put 5% down instead of 20% down for the purpose of buying more Bitcoin, which I did around $650.   Then Bitcoin tanked to like $200 and stayed there for almost a year and a half.  This whole time I was paying 4% interest on the money that I would have otherwise not borrowed.
The POINT is, when you can borrow at super low interest rates and half debt in an inflationary currency to buy a deflationary one, the odds are tremendously stacked in your favor.

What does "tangible mean"?  I assume by this you mean non-monetary utility.  If so, here is my response.
Bitcoin provides a lot of value in the form of monetary utility--that is, it is a better and more secure system of accounting than all other competing systems of accounting.  If you look at this history of money (accounting systems), you can see how they compete with one another and what happens when a "good money", having superior monetary properties competes with a "bad money" that lacks such advantages.
It is rational to borrow at 4% to buy bitcoin because we can rationally conclude that it is a superior money (accounting system) and will continue to gain market share as it competes against all other accounting systems--i.e. gold, fiat, and to some degree real estate, until Bitcoin achieves an de facto monopoly as the *only* viable currency.
This is an inevitable certainty.

I understand that you see this as a high risk asset.  I would argue you are attributing risk where there is none.  I would suggest you articulate the risk and do your own detailed analysis.  How does Bitcoin fail--list the ways it can fail.  Is there a scenario in which bitcoin is worth LESS in US dollars in 10 years then it is today?  Articulate this scenario.


This is the kind of thing shitty investors who have no clue what they are talking about say.  I am a small real estate investor.  Earlier this year my agent found me a stupid good deal where a commercial foreclosure property was listed (but not advertised well) at about 2/3 its market value.  I was able to get the property for 1/2 it's value and could have easily sold and recovered 100% of my investment under ANY reasonable scenario.  People keep saying  there is no such thing as high reward + low risk.  NO--that is NOT the case.  High reward + low risk DOES exist they are just rarer and require you to see what others do not.  But keep telling yourself that.  I guess the commercial property I own doesn't exist either, but the checks still keep coming in.


List them out.  Bitcoin has already had serious flaws found in its cryptography--for instance someone found an exploit to add like 100 billion bitcoins to the blockchain, and it came out of that situation like a champ.  I can't see a plausible scenario in which bitcoin goes to zero.

There is a theory in economics that the market abhors waste and that market forces will act to drive out inefficiencies.  This makes since when you think about it and matches what we observe in the real world.  Someone could have easily predicted Blockbuster's demise as soon as they saw and understood the Netflix model, or Borders &amp; Amazon if you prefer, just as someone today can look at Tesla and see the erosion of business model of most Automakers.
Bitcoin offers a way to do the things that the legacy financial sector current does but at *significantly* reduced cost.  Think about how many resources are used to provided banking/payment clearing services?  Or are lost to inflation, or resources used to secure gold?  All of these things can be done by Bitcoin for free or nearly free, so it should be obvious that Bitcoin will eventually take over the entire world economy.  Personally I am really looking forward to all of those banks that seem ubiquitous collapsing and going out of business.

People who own things generally come about owning them by efficiently managing and defending their capital resources.
A system that diverts capital to those who are efficient users of capital are going to be more efficient than those that take from them and redistribute to consumers.
Labor by itself is useless, it is only when labor is directed efficiently and combined with capital goods (land, equipment, management, etc) that it becomes productive.  
What I earn from owning things and from making sure those things are used efficiently does not in any way require other people to preform labor.  They can choose to, or choose not to, either way is fine with me.

Obviously that letter is retarded.  It was the idea of Tom Cotton--an especially ignorant bigot from my home state.  
It should be equally obvious that signing it is political pandering by Rand Paul.  People always say they hate pandering, but here's the thing--it works.  Libertarians often say they want a president like Ron Paul--whom I was a delegate for in 2012, but the truth is Ron had zero chance of getting elected because he wouldn't pander.  He would just slap people in the face with liberty.
That doesn't work because people are fucking stupid and want government to control "other" people.  You have to sneak liberty into power by putting a blanket of stupid over it.  This way the idiots will look upon the freedom-filled Trojan horse and proclaim "He's one of us!"

I don't really like to waste my time with ignorant people, but if the ability to use a currency to buy anything in the world is what gives it its value, then why do you think gold has value?
You have a child's view of how monetary economics work and a stubborn ignorance that will prevent you from learning and correcting your misconceptions.
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:43:17
I have a very different view of money (what it is, what properties are important, etc) than you do.
The term "use money" has a vastly different meaning to me than it does to you.
I do not think the frequency, speed, or even ease by which a currency changes ownership matters very much at all.  If you look at monetary history, you would likely come to the same conclusion.    Look at the Rai stones of Yap for example.


That's what you think a currency should be able to do.  That is not shown to be an important property when it comes to money.
So to summarize, I think Bitcoin can easily scale up to handle many TxO per second through either 1) lightning network, or 2) off chain solutions, but **even if it couldn't bitcoin would still take over, because TxO/s simply isn't very important--if it were, Rai stones would never have become money.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:54:16
That is incorrect and shows a severe misunderstanding of what money is and why it is useful.  A money does not need to increase in supply as the underlying economy grows.  
To whatever degree a currency is not a fixed supply that currency is that much less useful and efficient than one that is.
If you really think an inflationary currency is superior to one with fixed supply, I invite you to store your wealth in one.  As for me, I prefer deflationary money due to its superior monetary properties.

Spending in itself does not create or destroy resources, but rather determines how resources are allocated.  Spending can direct resources to build a factory or to assign people build useless pyramids and then tear them down.  In the 2008 crisis or 1929 for that matter, people reduced their spending in response to a signal of economic uncertainty.  This does not mean people stopped spending all together, but rather prioritized essentials and cut discretionary spending.  This obviously causes a cascade of consequences that many would tell you are negative, but I would suggest to you that this is a very positive and even necessary reallocation of resources to essential needs and away from unproductive economic activity.  It is like a scab forming in response to a wound.  
Also consider the tremendous benefits of cash hoarding--one of which is increased resistance to unexpected economic disruption.  This is easy for anyone to understand on the personal level, or even a corporation--e.g. car dies w/o cash = problem:: car dies w/ cash = much less of a problem, but is less difficult for people to understand on the level of a whole economy, but consider how if there are many cash holders an asset bubble will have buyers as the prices fall.
This is a very important point that most people simply do not understand, nor did I until I read a great article that was posted right here on In addition to resistance to economic disruption, cash hoarders provide an economy a greater ability to respond quickly to attractive investment opportunities.  Again, on the individual level this is easy to understand, but consider on the whole economy level things like the adoption and roll out of new promising technologies as they emerge.  Also, the more cash holders there are the more liquidity the underlying currency has--which I could go into detail about, but that in itself is a complex topic.


Yes, I do mean ledger.  Money is a sociological behavior that societies as a whole use to keep track of (or account for) reciprocal altruism.  In primitive societies this was done based on memory--e.g. I give you some of my mammoth kill and later you give me some of your fish or whatever.  It is a myth that barter was the first form of money; it was actually memory.  A person who never contributed would not have enough "owed favors" to continue mooching off the rest of society.  Eventually monies like seashells or giant stones emerged--i *highly* recommend you listen to the NPR plant money podcast about the Yap Money Stones.  All of these currencies, including the giant Yap stones were just a spreadsheet or ledger.  Of course it is important that people trust the ledger and that there is sufficient demand for ledger entries (these are all money tokens are, really) such that the ledger can be reliably used without significant loss of value when entering and exiting the ledger (this would be the case with low liquidity currencies).


Consider viewing these as competing ledgers.  Also consider that gold really has total dominance of the precious metals market.  The total value the world's gold makes up of the world's supply of "Gold+Silver" is about 95%, that is to say there is only gold, and then silver has a tiny slice.  I think it only has this tiny slice because gold is difficult to use in very small amounts.  Platinum is negligible, as is all other metals in terms of market cap.  Consider that these ledgers will compete against Bitcoin, and try to imagine how that will play out for them.  


Understand that Bitcoin is the world's first immutable and immortal ledger.   This is going to compete against other currencies (e.g. other ledgers) that have vastly inferior properties.  It doesn't take a lot to see how this is going to end for Bitcoin and its competitors.
As for inflation, you cannot have inflation without an inflator--that is, whenever new currency units are created, someone gets those new units and it is to their benefit to do so.  The entities that receive this newly created currency (Not you or me) have a vested economic interest in convincing other people that this is a good thing.  Really they are judge editing the ledger to give them more and more economic power at the expense of diluting everyone else's money (or their entries on the common ledger).  This is not possible with Bitcoin, which is one reason it is so vastly superior in terms of its monetary properties.
I will still respond to your other comments in your other post when I get a chance.  If you like learning about monetary economics, I highly recommend you read everything on this site:
specifically the articles by Saif, Daniel Krawisz, M. Goldstien, and P. Rochard.

No that's not the definition.  I think the way inflation is defined is intentionally misleading.
There is a distinction between "monetary inflation" and "price inflation", and these are two very different things.  Prices change for a lot of reasons one of those being increase in money supply, other reasons such as increased productivity or technology have nothing to do with inflation IMO.

You know, I really hate this smug condescending attitude people like you have about economics.  I understand my views are different from the "mainstream", but I am very confident my view is correct at least just as much as you and those who share your wrong views are.  But I have had the decency not to be a condescending jackass about it.  
I get very annoyed by this, but then I realize that if everyone were not so wrong in their understanding of monetary economics and the effects of inflation/deflation then everyone else would have concluded Bitcoin is much more valuable than it is and I would not be able to buy it so cheap.  That is, the only reason Bitcoin is this low is because of a severe misunderstanding of these issues, so really I should be thanking you for having your views, because I can profit from it.


That would be GDP.  I don't think this is a very effective measure of the productivity of an economy.  Consider that if I paid a bunch of people to spend their time producing paintings of me, this would increase GDP.  This does not mean that underlying economic activity would be productive.  GDP makes no distinction between spending a million dollars via capital investment and hedonistic consumption.  It's a garbage indicator.


I agree trade is good and some investment is good (there is such a thing as malinvestment).  Deflation does not disincentivize trade or investment per se, it does put an emphasis on investment quality--why would any rational investor invest in anything that does not offer a risk-adjusted returned higher than the deflation rate?  But I would argue that is a good thing.


You are very wrong on this point.  I think a lot of what you attribute to "contributing to the economy" is really just wasteful consumption.  I higher percentage of spending diverts resources that could otherwise be put to more productive use to wasteful enterprises.  Do you recall the "Cash for Clunkers" program?  This program produced a spike in spending, do you argue this was good for the economy as a whole?


If you are looking to George Bush for a good understanding of economics, I would suggest you are looking in the wrong place.
You are probably correct that spending produces more tax revenue, which is then used inefficiently by the government (War, war on drugs, TSA, etc).   I would argue this is also bad.


This is NOT true at all.  Money that is saved is very vital to the economy.  Consider that if you as an individual saves enough money you may be able to avoid purchasing insurance because you could absorb this risk.  Likewise savers allow the rest of the economy to take more risk because the savers can then step in when the train derails with their liquidity.  An economy with little or no savings is LESS able to take and absorb risk than one that is.  I have a really excellent article that articulates this point, but I am doubtful you would read it if I sent it to you.


I enjoy economics quite a bit.  I think you are drawing incorrect conclusions and believing them to be "facts".  But then again, so are a lot of other people.  It just makes more opportunity for me so I'm not going to complain.

Hey dude, I'm going to try to respond to your post in more detail later, but i want to write a few points real quick.
I'm going to make a couple of claims I would like for you to consider in the mean time that are relevant to your first paragraphs.  First-  Less spending and consumption is good for the economy--in that it will lead to a more productive and less wasteful society.  Second, hoarding or saving money (under the allegorical mattress) provides a lot of benefits to the economy as a whole.
You are wrong about why money is valuable.  I encourage you to think very deeply about this, because if you get this wrong, you get a lot of things that flow from this basis wrong.  Consider all the monies that societies have used and what properties they had.  Why did seashells, Yap stones, glass beads, gold, and later fiat win out and become dominate currencies?  Consider that it is because money is a spreadsheet and the best spreadsheet wins--**always**.
Im going to reply later because I can tell you put some thought into your post and are not as much of an arrogant jackass as most fools on here.  Money is fascinating, and if I can suggest some alternate ways for you to view monetary economics it might click for you and make sense.  Almost everyone gets almost everything wrong when it comes to money--if they understood it they would see how the future will play out for bitcoin.

If Bitcoin can be shut down by the government, it is worthless.
I think the US government's War on Drugs shows the difficulty in regulating something people want into obscurity.  I suspect that if the US government makes it illegal to own bitcoin the price will go up substantially.  It's like drugs or ivory.  
Here's the thing though, imagine what happens when government points its gun at Bitcoin and fires and the world sees Bitcoin standing their unscathed.  


What's the risk you see?  Is it government "shutting down" bitcoin as you say above?  It's going to be interesting for sure, but Bitcoin is super easy to hide, transport, and secure.  Imagine how well the US's War on Drugs would be going if drugs could be made invisible, perfectly secured, or teleported anywhere in the world.
Also there's two really good articles you should read about how bitcoin will just subvert government agents who are sent to shut it down.

Holy shit you are so far off it isn't even funny.  First off, the strength (and liquidity) of a currency is determined by people's willingness to hold it.  If people were to start holding bitcoin more (and spending it less), this would cause bitcoin to take over other currencies sooner rather than later.
A person uses a currency when they hold it.  They stop using it the moment they spend it.  People don't even know what it means to "use" a currency and that causes all sorts of backasswards wrong thinking.
People should NOT spend bitcoin, it is illogical to do so, AND if bitcoin would be better off if people would stop spending it as long as people are willing to accept USD and other weaker currencies.

Even this cannot be certain.  The amounts of hydrogen &amp; oxygen are determine from analysis of the wavelengths of light, how can you be certain our sun is not a dyson star that is imitating and faking our attempts at analysis??

I am familiar with the economic cancer you call MMT.
It's just not accurate.  Seignorage is a tax, just different than property or income tax.  Taxation does not create demand for a currency and it is utterly asinine to claim it does.  By all means, set up a society that funds itself this way--it will inevitably collapse but it will also allow people who understand economics to profit from its collapse via speculative attacks.

For this we look to markets where there were currencies competing against other currencies with similar or identical properties for reference and we see that currencies benefit tremendously from network effects.   It's like eBay.  You don't have to worry about eBay impersonators replacing eBay because it has such a huge economic moat.  In order for another auction site to replace eBay it would have to offer substantial value to overcome this tremendous advantage.
Also look to precious medals.  There is only Gold there is no 2nd place competitor that has ever come close to replacing gold's dominance (value of all the worlds silver = about 5% of the value of the world's gold).  Basically once a currency gets a lead in terms of network advantage, other currencies must offer the market something the leading currency doesn't in order to even have a real chance of catching up.

Sure.  I think earlier on another coin could have surpassed bitcoins network effect if it had been executed well and generated enough demand.

This is how idiots think demand for currency is generated.  No offense.  Demand could (and technically is, I suppose) generated by the fact that people are obliged to pay taxes.
However, the government does not horde the dollars paid to it via taxation, so this effect is negated.  The US government actually pays out more dollars than it takes in, which requires other people to hold them to support their value.  If the US government stopped taxing people and also stopped spending dollars, the demand for the dollar would necessarily increase because there would be fewer of them coming into circulation.
This would be like if Vikings showed up to your village and demanded...seashells every year.  OF COURSE that would create demand for seashells.  Now suppose that every year the Vikings sold/traded/exchanged MORE seashells than it required in the form of tribute.  The value of seashells would of course decline because this situation, when viewed in its entirety would not generate demand for them.

You can't just assert that something is "obvious".  I understand Keynesian claim this nonsense to be true, but they are very much wrong.  This thinking is so absurd it is hard for me to understand how people can believe this to be true.


Both are concerns and both are problems that occur when you have centralized economic planning.

Well don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya.
If you think way the alternative currencies (USD, or other) have their monetary policies determined is superior to the comedy circus you see here, then go right ahead and sell your Bitcoins.
When it comes to money, there are going to be strong disagreements on the subject.  Bitcoin handles this by a consensus-based method that is very visible and very open.  If that makes you uncomfortable you can choose the money whose "protocol" is decided differently by a central authority, usually a group of central bankers meeting in private and dictating to everyone using the currency what the monetary policy will be.
The only reason you have all this "drama" here in Bitcoin is because people have a choice, and I'd take that any day over the alternative.

Because markets don't work this way.  This is overly simplistic and how idiot's imagine markets work.  It does not take into account the MANY variables that impact monetary economics. 
This does not take into account the supply or demand of the underlying asset, or the supply/demand/properties of the competing currencies.  If you want to understand bitcoin you need to understand the global competitive market for money and that is far more complex than some shit-chart with no axes or labels, but rather snarky snippets that provide no useful information floating all over the place.
Basically this subreddit is a tiny amount of people who understand the technical aspects of Bitcoin and a tiny amount of people who understand monetary economics and a fuckton of idiots who don't know what the fuck they are doing or what is going on here.

Correct.  I consider the term price inflation to be intellectually dishonest.
Prices rise and fall for many reasons, including supply/demand/productivity--which is continually increasing, and monetary inflation.
To use the term inflation to cover this is deceptive and pointless.
Basically we have a situation where we have productivity working to lower prices and monetary inflation working to increase them.  The net effect may be around 2-3% increase per year on average, but the true cost of (monetary) inflation is much higher; it eats away the productivity gains people would reap and puts an additional 2-3% on top of that.  To call this total "inflation" is a shady attempt to hide the much larger cost or the ramblings of an economically illiterate fool.

Yes but the risks are very different.  With Bitcoin there is risk that the value may disappear due to volatility.

You are misunderstanding my claim.  We have substantial data about how currencies preform in the market place, which currencies are the market chooses over others, and **what monetary properties the market desires in a currency**.  
If you analyze the data properly come to the right conclusion &amp; model of what money is, what function it serves, why money is valuable, and what attributes are important for a money to have then you can understand everything from why seashells/glass beads/gold/and Yap stones were used as money and what happens when an inferior currency comes into market competition with a currency with superior monetary properties.  
What I am claiming is that a person who correctly understands money could have known Bitcoin's rise to monopolistic domination of the global economy as soon as he read the white paper (and would have known this would have occurred *before* bitcoin existed if a currency with bitcoin's properties were to come into existence).
If anything Bitcoin's rise is going much slower than I would have expected, but the end result--I know that with certainty and it is supreme Bitcion domination.

This is what many people seem to *think* would happen, but is not actually the case.  First, off there would be an economic equilibrium that would be reached.  I will try to illustrate with three different arguments.
1- In a deflationary economy, we would expect individuals to require a higher risk-adjusted return from their investments, that is, if purchasing power increases at 2% per year, an investment must offer a more attractive return.  This provides a strong preference for higher quality investments, which I think is a good thing.  Basically in a deflationary world, we would expect the value of the currency to rise proportionally to increased productivity, as such only above-average investments would be more attractive than holding currency.
2- Time is deflationary, and time is another factor in purchasing goods/services.  A person would rather have a widget now rather than a widget a year from now (for example, you could use the widget to produce more goods to earn more money).  Inflation shifts the time preference of the economy, making it preferable to consume resources now rather than later.  Deflation would shift this so that people would take a longer term consideration--why buy one marshmallow when I can have 2 in a year?  It's still a time sensitive equation though, as it is better to have a marshmallow now than in a year.
3- Consider that currently it is possible for people to increase their risk-adjusted purchasing power over time just by adding a simple step.  Someone could simply by treasury bonds and grow their purchasing power over time.  People COULD do this and yet they don't.  People spend money because they want things NOW and companies spend money because they can use those underlying resources more efficiently to earn more money than they would by buying bonds.

Why do you think this property matters?  It certainly didn't matter on the island of Yap.  It's not really my job to convince you or educate you on economics.  Time is the only arbiter of our disagreement.


I don't think it matters what people do or if they as individuals decide to use Bitcoin.   Bitcoin will be forced upon them by economic necessity, because that's how monetary adoption works.


The hypothetical layperson is going to use whatever currency will be accepted by the hypothetical storekeeper who will accept whatever currency will be accepted by his hypothetical suppliers.  If you follow this chain you would realize that the important thing that people's willingness to hold currency over time.  Bitcoin is by far the best currency in this regard and is also the best currency *possible*.  Therefore, the end result is the layperson will use bitcoin because he has no other choice.  All that other bullshit that you think is important like confirmation time, blah blah blah, etc can be built on top of the base layer of Bitcoin...or not, it doesn't really matter and wouldn't prevent hyperbitcoinization if it were not technically possible (though it is)


If you can't explain why Rai stones, seashells, glass beads, or gold were used as money in the past, you do not understand money.  If you don't understand money you can't see the inevitable future of Bitcoin's supreme domination of the world economy.  But in 10 years when Bitcoin has crushed every other wannabe currency, come back here and think on the lessons you could have learned from the Rai stones.

Do you think there was ubiquitous demand for Yap stones on the island of Yap?  Is there ubiquitous demand for gold or even fiat currency?  Currencies do not become the dominate currency in their market by everyone suddenly choosing to demand them.  Economic consensus emerges and it looks like that consensus is building around Bitcoin.
Let's suppose that ONLY libertarians, cyberpunks, and criminals were to use bitcoin, and everyone else were to refuse and only use USD.  The libertarian criminal cyberpunks would have an economic advantage over the rest of society, as their money would not devalue due to inflation.  Naturally the value of Bitcoin would continue to grow if for no other reason than that the other currencies fall in value over time.  *Eventually* bitcoin will be wroth $1 million per coin, and knowing this up front would lure people over to jump on the boat, which causes a feedback look as the network size grows.




Most people don't understand what money is and how it is used.  In order to understand what Bitcoin is, you must first understand what money is, and what properties make a good money vs a bad one.  Almost everyone gets this wrong which is why they can't she the future and how clear it is regarding bitcoin.

It might drop, but then it would rise.  There is no scenario in which Bitcoin is not worth $1 million dollars each....eventually.


At any given time 100% of the money is under someone's mattress.
I largely agree with you though, I think that is why fiat has beaten gold--2% loss per year is less than the pain-in-the-ass that gold + cost of securing it is.  Fiat beat gold in the market, and would do so again.  Also the supply of gold is increasing as well, especially when the price goes up and people start mining like crazy.  This is not the case with Bitcoin.

Yes it does. 
I think you have a fundamentally flawed understanding of monetary economics.  There *is* benefit to an economy when someone hoards money under a mattress.  I understand you do not see how this makes an economy better, but I tried to give you some examples.
You seem to think an economy in which people spend money and no one hoards it would be healthier and more productive than one that does.  This is not true, but I don't think I'm able to correct your thinking; people are just very stubborn about their views on money even though most people don't seem to have a clue.
I have come to realize I am among an extremely small number of people who correctly understands money and therefore able to see the future of Bitcoin and the hyper-productive world economy it will create with clarity.  I'm sorry you don't.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:31:17


i would argue yes.  You have more economic power than you had before this occurrence.  Would a real estate investment company that does market research and successfully buys up property around where they expect a new mall or economic center is going to be built, paying a profit dividend to shareholders be considered "generating wealth"?  If not, why not?


That persons economic power has increased, ergo wealth has been generated for him.  Without the existence of this person the previous owner would either not have been able to sell for the same price or would have had his or her capital encumbered for a longer period of time.


You would agree that economic power has value, correct?  If so, generating economic power is in itself creating something of value.  Sometimes saving capital when everyone else is being overly reckless is providing a sorely needed benefit.








In simple economic terms there is no profit difference in reducing expenses and whatever you are trying to call "wealth generation".  If you reduce an expense by having a barrel of cash, you have necessarily become more profitable.  I don't know what is so difficult about this to understand and wonder if you are just intellectually dishonest.  Either way, if you can't understand how having a barrel of money can lead to higher profitability, I don't know that I can help you.  Some people just like being ignorant.

You need to understand the importance of the word "never".  When in the history of humanity has money sat in a value that remains accessible but persists **NEVER** being used.  If it truly is never used, that is one thing.  If it sits unused for a long time waiting for an opportunity for its holder to spend it, that is a very different situation.


If the coins are sold, demand is reduced by the amount equal to the person holding 100k BTC but was previously unwilling to sell.  Obviously this would impact DEMAND, but not supply.


You need to do some thinking on this question for yourself.  The resources are out there.  Try to come up with an answer and let me know if you have more specific questions.


Suppose you are a doctor with medical malpractice liability insurance that you pay $300/month for.  Now suppose that you save $250,000.  You may then be able to demonstrate sufficient financial health to self-insure and opt out of the malpractice liability insurance requirement.  This is an example where by money hoarded or not "changing hands" has produced a quantifiable economic gain for the holder.
You're welcome.

In terms of purchasing power, which is what matters, your current wages drop year to year if they remain nominally the same.  If your wages fall in nominal terms but increase in purchasing power, that is all that matters.  Who cares about the nominal amount?

In the last 30 days what is the average cash balance you've held?  You don't have to answer but what I am getting at here is do your have an emergency fund? 
If you do it allows you to withstand disruptions like a car breakdown or medical expenses without falling into disaster.  If you were fully invested you would have to liquidate assets to cover the expense.
But you have cash so you don't.  Cash allows people to remaining agnostic and uncommitted to absorb such disruptions but also to take and valance of opportunities that come up.
This is true for the individual but it is also true at the corperate level as well.  The reasons GM and many banks became insolvent in 2008 was because of lack of cash.  If you're fully invested selling assets to cover expenses becomes a nasty feedback loop.
What many people don't get is that this is also true on the larger still societal level.  A society with cash savers can better absorb disruption and heal quicker.
The reason people sit on cash is to someday use it, and when assets prices start to fall they move in.  They buy up foreclosures, loan to businesses that are stable but having a liquidity crisis, etc.  Savers are the emergency fund of an economy and 2008 is an example of what can happen when there are not enough capital reserves left uncommitted

This is a question I had when I first discovered Bitcoin.
Money is market that favors a natural monopoly.  If you look at examples of money and how people use it, a society will always tend to favor one currency.  This is because there is no benefit to having competing currencies and there is an opportunity cost for holding currency at the expense of others.  That is, whatever amount you own in gold is that much less that you can own in silver.
You may be thinking that Gold and Silver are examples of two currencies co-existing in the same market equilibrium, but this is not the case.  The value of all gold is worth about 96% of the gold/silver market leaving only 4% for silver.  Of that 4%, some of that is due to silver's non-monetary value.  I suspect the remaining value is largely due to gold's inability to handle small transactions creating a niche market for silver. 
As to how I know Bitcoin won't be taking over, the network effect(S)-and plural because there are MANY are very strong.  Most notably Bitcoin has more demand and willingness to hoard it (liquidity).  For another currency to take over, would require economic consensus to shift, and consensus is not an easy thing to change.  Imagine it as a very very very large wall.
This wall *can* be scaled if a money has superior monetary properties, as is currently the case with Bitcoin gaining vs US Dollars and Gold, but in the absence of LARGE advantage in monetary properties, it is impossible to overcome the network lead Bitcoin has.
You might as well ask how do we know an Elvis impersonator won't  overtake the original in terms of popularity

Because they could not corroborated on the level that would require it such a society to exist.  Before bitcoin, conditions were such that the state would naturally arise and oppress the people.  With Bitcoin, individuals can control their money and protect it from the state.  This kills the state.
Bitcoin will allow true capitalism that is state resistant.

I suspect the remaining value is largely due to gold's inability to handle small transactions creating a niche market for silver.
In short, the currency with the best monetary properties will compete against all other currencies until it becomes a de facto monopoly due to the feedback loop caused when money becomes more and more useful as it gains value.


I'm not sure why merchant acceptance matters.  Eventually merchants will have to accept Bitcoin because they will have no choice, but right now plenty of people are willing to accept inferior currencies.  Have you heard of Grisham's law?  It basically says bad money drives out good.  If you have a situation where there are two currencies--one that is inflationary loses value over time (bad) and one that is deflationary (good), we would expect the deflationary money to be pulled out of circulation as people have a higher preference for hoarding this currency than the bad one. 
As I see it there is (almost) no reason for anyone to purchase things with Bitcoin as long as merchants will accept dollars and other shitty currency.


Look at price chart.  If you look closely you will see Bitcoin rapidly gaining market share and squeezing out competitors (if you correctly understand and define money).


It is good to know there are some things that are so self-evident they are obvious to both of us.  Unfortunately, money and economics are not yet among those things.


Who cares?  I don't think transactions per second is very important at least on the base layer.  This can easily be done 2nd layer as is being done by Lizzy "Lightning" Stark.  As far as I know dollars cannot be exchanged at 600 transactions per second without this being handled on a 2nd layer built on top of the currency.  


I probably pay more taxes than you.  Fortunately you can pay taxes with shitty currencies which I have no interest holding long term.  I am opposed to compulsory taxation, but what are you going to do?
Eventually Bitcoin will constrain government's size to the point where individuals have much more power.  Also, the funding for governments will have to come through taxation, and that will impose fiduciary responsibility upon those governments.  I think it will be a lot more willingness to pay taxes voluntarily after bitcoin destroys big government as 1) the amount will be reasonable, and 2) those taxes will not go toward things I am not super opposed to, such as war.   


Why would you want to spend something as valuable as Bitcoin when people will accept dollars for coffee instead?  Eventually they won't, but as long as they do--drink up!!


Can you do an ELI5 for those whom you insult as "dumbasses"?
Sure.  Demand for bitcoin will continue to rise as it has done so since it was created.  Speculative attacks will begin against these weaker currencies, and their controlling central banks will not be able to raise interest rates high or quickly enough to stop their underlying currencies from losing value.
This will push the purchasing power of bitcoin up dramatically.  With demand going up liquidity and stability increase, while the demand and liquidity for shitty currencies begin to decrease.
You should note Thiers' law which states good money drives out bad:

Look at what happens in places like Venezuela when the government currency becomes worthless.

I think this shows how one incorrect assumption can lead someone so far astray.   In any case, the market is is treating Roger appropriately with BCH now worth less than 0.1 Bitcoin and I'm sure his economic power has greatly decreased as a result to the point of being nearly irrelevant.

The things you mention are negative, not positive.   I do not want a money that can be melted or worn as jewelry.  These things are distractions from a currency's function as money. 
Bitcoin has better monetary properties than gold without the undesirable non-monetary uses.
* Easier to secure
* Easier to transport
* More limited and more known supply
* Easier to authenticate/more difficult to counterfeit
* Easier record-keeping and payment clearing
It's a better money, yo.  And you can expect market prices to reflect this once the market figures this out.

Bitcoin will not just replace every part of the Fiat market, but also the Store of Value market.  It will replace fiat, gold, silver, and a large portion of certain bonds.  It will compete against real estate and some equities.
In addition to this, Bitcoin will make the size of the pie larger by greatly reducing inefficiency in the economy.  Right now about 14% of the economy's value is sucked up and wasted by the finance sector.

We need a common definition of inflation.
To answer your question, yes printing 500 trillion would cause an instant spike in monetary inflation.
The only reason to print 500 trillion and put it in a vault is to someday use it.  If you put it in a hypothetical vault that can never be accessed it would be the same as destroying the 500T.  
If the market knew of the 500T then it would in theory instantly adjust to the new supply, but if that 500T is being held in a vault demand has also increased.  That is some entity is demanding the 500T enough to hold it instead of exchanging it for the resources it could by.  The extent of this new demand is unknown to the market.  Will the 500t controller keep the 500T held in a vault for 1000 years or 1 day?
If the 500t creation is unknown to the market they do not have impact until the corropsinding demand starts to slip (those new dollars are sold).  But monetary inflation has still occurred regardless, and a prudent investor may seek to exit the dollar market.

It is simple really.  People do not spend much time thinking about currency or the nature of money--it is a topic that is neglected as most people just go about their day accepting (and holding) dollars to store value in.  They do this because it works, but they do not know why it works.

Somewhere there is some fool proclaiming they are a TA stock market genius because they "were right".  Suviorship bias is a thing, Yo!


Congrats on knowing the difference.  I do not consider price inflation to be inflation.  The naming here is really annoying to me, and intellectually dishonest IMO.  Regarding supply inflation, I think you should view Bitcoin NOT as dis-inflationary but rather deflationary, as in the supply is decreasing, not that the rate of increase is slowing.  In other words, the supply of bitcoin IS fixed (less those that are lost), but not all of them are yet claimed.
See [here for a better explaination](
then you are arguing that "any moron should be able to see that Bitcoin will go up in price" which is not at all true, and a point of massive dispute (and if it were so obvious, we would see effectively-immediate hyperbitcoinization as a result). Most people don't believe that Bitcoin is going to continue rising in price (despite its supply growth curve) and this is absolutely a niche opinion right now. Of course, most people don't have "a correct understanding of monetary economics" either, but that brings us to yet another point: such a thing probably does not objectively exist, anyway.
A correct understanding of monetary economics would be a cohesive explanation of what money's function is and what attributes make one currency better than another, as well as an ability to predict what the outcome of currency competition in a market.
As to hyperbitcoinization, this does NOT depend on people realizing Bitcoin is superior and coming to the correctly conclusion; aslo I would argue hyperbitcoinization IS happening right now--it is a process that will take some time.
You on the other hand, seem to be a clown that makes a bunch of price predictions, and because of survivor bias think that price action validates your stated reasons, *even though you are not able to show causality*
You remind me of [this asshole]( who predicted the stock market crash of 1929, but whose understanding of the reasons WHY were....a bit off.


I predict it is very likely we will see prices north of $100k within the next 4 years BECAUSE OF THE TRANSIT OF MERCURY.  When this happens, I will come back to and make absurd proclamations bragging about how right I am. 
 &gt;Not only is that a ridiculous conclusion in the first place and basically just childish hyperbole, but you have no idea what my financial situation is like and I have no intention of being baited by an obvious troll into disclosing it anyway.
Like I said, these predictions are publicly verifiable for anyone who cares to check (or even ask), but instead of curiosity or recognition I am more often met with crude and ignorant attempts at derision, of which you're an excellent example.
  Learn survivor-ship bias, lets ye make yourself look like a fool worthy of derision.

No one is going to eat at that restaurant because the wait is too long.  People will only eat there if it stops being so crowded.
PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE IM GETTING TIRED OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN THIS:
**Demand for currency is NOT caused by how frequently or how eagerly people give up that currency for some good or service**
You should go back and look at examples where you two currencies competing with each other.  There are many examples of this when some 3rd or 2nd world nation's currency starts to lose value and another superior currency disappears from circulation.
Here are two facts you need to understand.  They seem contradictory but they are not.  I will write an article explaining why when I get a chance.
[Good money drives out bad money](
[Bad money drives out good money](
But just real quick, the 2nd world currency does not drop in circulation as it loses value--in fact it *increases* in circulation while the superior currency *seems* to disappear.

@_date: 2017-05-02 16:15:36
I suggest that your economic analysis of inflation is incorrect.  We can all agree that monetary inflation is an increase in the supply of a money, but the supply of Bitcoin is not expanding—it is 21 M (less lost coins).  The coins that have not already been mined exist and we know what their quantity is so we should treat them as such.  This is similar to a land grab of areas that are known to exist, but have not yet been claimed.  Or think of those still-to-be-mined bitcoins as bitcoins as part of the supply because their existence is known and priced in by the market.  This is different than traditional fiat monetary inflation or even that of gold, which involves the expansion of the amount of money known to the market.

Oh boy.  You fundamentally do not understand money.  
Money has an opportunity cost, unlike social networks.  A person can have a myspace account while also having a facebook account.  A person cannot own Bitcoin and also dollars in the sense that they are mutually exclusive.  That is for every dollar or bitcoin a person owns, he must necessarily own less of the other.  
You are also misunderstanding what it means to use money.  A person does not use money when they buy something; that is when they STOP using money.  
Money is a ledger that accounts for deferred consumption.  A person begins using money when he accepts it and continues using it while holding.  The moment he buys something he exits that ledger and is no longer using money.

People save money.  That they do this shows there must be a benefit to doing so.  Look at economies with high savings rates vs low.  The idea that money sitting under the mattress is not of current benefit is just wrong and does not align with what we would expect to see.

Well you are simply wrong.  Bitcoin and Gold compete against each other when it comes to money.  As a result of network effects, there will be a feedback loop in where the bigger a currency gets the better monetary properties it has.  Once bitcoin eats into gold's market share of the money arena, gold's liquidity will drop and Bitcoin's will rise.
If you don't believe me look how gold became the *only* PM that is used as money.  Now before you ask about Ag, I will remind you that the value of gold makes up 96% of the combined value of gold and silver, and the only reason silver had that 4% is because it was too difficult to divide gold up into pieces small enough for small transations

Monopoly taught me so much about money.
Somehow all the paper money was lost and we ended up playing with a sheet of notebook paper that maintained the player balances--a spreadsheet of sorts.  It worked better than the actual money that came with the game.  
Money is a ledger--that is all it is, and currencies compete among each other.  The problem is there is a tremendous incentive to alter or manipulate the ledgers unfairly and some ledgers have special legal privilege that allow the maintainers of the ledger to fuck other people over.
Then in 2009 a new ledger appeared.  A perfect incorruptible, omnipresent, and immortal ledger.  There should be no question how this plays out if you understand economics because you will know the better currency will win.
When you play monopoly with a shared spreadsheet you don't have to argue about who the banker is or worry that the banker is cheating because you have an open ledger and can see all transactions.

I suggest that your economic analysis of inflation is incorrect.  We can all agree that monetary inflation is an increase in the supply of a money, but the supply of Bitcoin is not expanding—it is 21 M (less lost coins).  The coins that have not already been mined exist and we know what their quantity is so we should treat them as such.  This is similar to a land grab of areas that are known to exist, but have not yet been claimed.  Or think of those still-to-be-mined bitcoins as bitcoins as part of the supply because their existence is known and priced in by the market.  This is different than traditional fiat monetary inflation or even that of gold, which involves the expansion of the amount of money known to the market.

Okay so we have a situation where your expected outcome is not matching up with actual results.  Perhaps you should check your underlying premise that "If no one spends it, it will lose value".

I would expect those items to revert to their value as a commodity that is due to their material properties.   This is very low relative to current price for "precious metals" because they currently have a monetary premium associated with them because of their usefullness as money.  Imo this usefullness is no more as there is a new competitor in the market with far superior properties.

You can make a good argument that Bitcoin's strict supply limit makes it extremely inelastic with respect to price.
You cannot definitively say "When we break the previous all-time-high there will be an energy and momentum that could carry Bitcoin into the $5,000 - $10,000 range; and extremely quickly."   
This is just mere speculation on your part.  Bitcoin could go up to the previous ATH and then stay there, or collapse back, or whatever.  You are trying to use this technical analysis charting bullshit that is just so absurd.  Of course people try to divine future price by looking at charts all the time; they're all equally stupid.

Very few people gt it when it comes to Bitcoin, or even money in general for that matter.  Money is a ledger for tracking and quantifying reciprocal altruism.  Currency such as dollars or gold are just tokens that attempt to keep track of their respective ledgers.  Bitcoin is a far better ledger.
The reason people think a currency has to be "backed by" something is because in the past that was the only way to keep the ledger from being expanded and abused by those controlling it.  It was a check or countermeasure against monetary expansion that is no longer needed.

I would like to suggest to you that you do not understand money's function in a society or why it becomes valuable.  Only when you understand why seashells, gold, dollars, Yap stones, etc were used as money can you understand why Bitcoin is better than all of them, but when you gain this understanding the future will be very clear to you.


Consider: What is the value of a money that costs *nothing* to create?  If you look at currencies that rose to prominence in the past they are always something that required effort to produce or obtain.


Can you stop for a minute and consider how utterly asinine that argument is?  I don't blame you as this is the kind of nonsense that gets thrown about.  First, money existed long before people were encumbered by a "debt" they allegedly owe to a government.  Secondly, this would just beg the question as to why government wants the money--to pay some larger government, perhaps?  This is circular reasoning.  In reality government spews out more money than it demands, which actually lowers the value of the currency.  I would suggest you consider the *only* reason dollars have value is because people and institutions hold them (and that government is not a net holder).


Why hold gold?  Why hold those slips of paper when you play monopoly with your family?  The reason is the same as to hold bitcoin.  Consider that money is really a way to keep score, or to track reciprocal altruism.  Think of it as a ledger for tracking favors--because that is all money really is.  The gold, the dollars, the seashells, the monopoly money, they are all just tokens that track score on a ledger.  
The value of money is its usefulness and reliability as a ledger.  The fiat ledger can be edited by governments on a whim, the gold ledger is difficult to secure/store/transport, but now there is a new competitor with a new set of monetary properties.  This new competitor will compete in the currency marketplace until it destroys all other currencies.

Your risk analysis is wrong.  Your home will retain its utility regardless of what happens.
Gold and Silver have been tried and true stores of value that have withstood the test of time for 5000 years. 
The thing is for those 5000 years, gold/silver did not have to compete with Bitcoin.  Gold had the best monetary properties.  Gold now has new competition in the form of Bitcoin.  Bitcion's properties are demonstrably superior to Gold and therefore you can know with almost absolute certainty that Bitcoin will supplant gold's position as a store of value.  In short, your gold is now useless because Bitcoin now exists, though the rest of the world will take some time to figure this out

The market for a store of value, which is all a currency really is, is market that favors a natural monopoly.  The nature of money is such that if you have two currencies competing in a free market, one will grow at the expense of the other(s) until there is only one.

OH MY GOD do not get me started on US Bank.  I now have 4 bank accounts and I love all of them, but my experience with US Bank made me understand why so many people hate their banks.  I really felt like they were trying to jew me out of my money by all manner of fuckery.  
First they offered me $100 to set up an account with them and maintain at least 1000$ balance for 12 months, so I signed up....but then they explain that I have to have some sort of bullshit where I have to transfer at least $25/month from checking to saving, for god-knows-what reason, and if I didn't then my account wouldn't have any activity and I would get it by a $12.50 fee.  But the cow that set up my account said she could set up an automatic transfer so I wouldn't have to worry.  4 months later I noticed there were 4 $12.50 charges on my account because bank cow didn't set it up right.
So I raised all manner of hell and made them refund the money and set it up correctly.  Then they did it again, and this time they were not willing to refund the charges.  So I demanded to speak to the bank president and made it clear I would file a complaint with every state and regulator agency and sue them in small claims court for the $12.50.   I got my goddamn $12.50 back.  As soon as the 12 month period ended I closed my account and literally told them to fuck off.
Also they gave me some sort of debit card that had a Cartoon Pig that promoted SAVING.  I'm a GROWN-ASS MAN and you're going to give me a debit card with a mother fucking cartoon pig on it so I can look like some 12 year old saving his allowance.  Fuck you.  Fuck you and fuck your cartoon pig and your shitty spam marketing gimmicks.  
I seriously love my banks now, but feel an intense anger whenever I drive by a US bank building or see anything about them.  I hope someone turns their stupid cartoon pig into bacon.

Did you read the article?  It explains why inflation is only a thing because the supply increase is unknown and continues increasing.  Sure if you a holder dumps 1M coins on the market, that has a short term impact, more so because the demand has *decreased* than supply has increased, which....it hasn't really.  There is still the same supply in existence (both mined and unmined) before and after the sale.


You're really going out on a limb there with those wacky predictions!  How could anyone have known these very obvious things would occur!?  The only one I didn't also "predict" is the *timing* of segwit adoption, which was very much dependent on the decisions of a few people whose thinking you could not have fully known, so on this case your "prediction" was dependent upon the choices of ONE person.  Even though we predicted the same things, I didn't go on an Attention-Getter proclaiming myself as an economic soothsayer on an internet message board.


That is *NOT ENOUGH* and that you think it would be sufficient reveals profound ignorance about scientific rigor.  It MAY suggest you have a good understanding of economics, but does not prove causality.  For that, you would need to start isolating variables and statistically normalization and things you probably don't even know how to do. 


How can you think the number of people who disagreed with you is in any way relevant?  This is BITCOIN, the vast majority does not understand what is going on here (hyperbitcoinization) so of course they are going to be very very wrong.  That you are right on some (what I would consider) obvious outcomes does NOT mean you are right about the underlying causes of them, especially considering you admit there are many variables.  For example if the halvening was every 10 years instead, I think we would have still seen a similar rise in bitcoin price, due to its superior monetary properties. 


DID YOU SEE WHAT THE TRANSIT OF VENUS DID FOR THE PRICE OF BITCOIN??


Literally predicted the same thing as you regarding Fraudtoshi and BCrash, and Segwit adoption (eventually), as well as the general price rise and emergence of alt coins.
Nonetheless some fun questions:
Which will fall to Bitcoin first, gold or fiat?  When?
What is the max percentage of Bitcoin's value an altcoin will ever reach?  Why?
What will be the price of bitcoin 3 months after it is banned by a major government vs price before ban?  Why?
How will governments try to kill Bitcoin when they start taking the threat seriously?
Where will we first see bitcoin be the de facto currency used by an economy?  (even I dont know the answer to this one)
When will Etherum lose 2nd place in terms of crypto marketcap?

The mechanism for tracking private property does have problems.  Also I do see some problem with how certain types of private property came to be owned--land for example.  This is an ideological problem I struggled with when I first became an anarcho capitalist.  I think it is a legitimate concern as it does not make since for the first person to claim ownership over something to have it.
That said, the evidence I have seen points to it not mattering much how private property originated, just that private property rights are respected.  I am speaking mostly of the extensive work by Hernando de Soto, but we can also see many examples of this.
Obligatorily I'm not racist but...
Indians are the worst people in America.  What I mean by this is not that they are racially or genetically inferior, but that they are by far the worst demographic by any metric; they have the highest rates of alcohol and drug addiction, by far the most extreme poverty and income disparity in their communities.  The worst health--they're fatter than Mississippi, and the worst education.  Why is this?
It is because many Indians have different rules than the rest of us when it comes to private property rights.  Indians, who live on reservations by-in-large cannot mortgage or sell their homes like you or I can.  Their land is collectively "owned" by the community, and this results in a shitty standard of living for everyone except those at the top--the ones with the political power.  It is really quite embarrassing that we allow this in America.  Of course we can compare them to the Indians who have exited that system of communal property ownership and see they are much more successful, so we can know it is not a racial or cultural issue.
De Soto does a far more extensive comparison of similar societies that handled property rights privately vs collectively and it is quite clear the impact is dramatic.  I recall a documentary that also talks on this topic--i can find it if you are interested.
So to summarize, yes there are problems with the origin and tracking of private property rights, but technical considerations aside, respecting private property rights provides tremendous economic advantage over societies that do not.

Goliath is heavily armored and well equipped to fight other giants, but his expensive weapons are complteley ineffective against the small and nimble David, in fact the more Goliath swings his sword the more energy he used up; Goliath literally has nothing he can do.  He does have a big ass vulnerability for which our Bitcoin David is well equipped to exploit.

Do not jump down this intellectual abyss by trying to see reason in the actions of gold-loving dinosaurs.
The arguments for gold are completely absurd and are the result people who do not understand monetary issues down to first principles.  They therefore say things like "gold has a entrenzik value" and "gold has withstood the *test of thyme*" and other laughable nonsense.
If you understand *why* gold had monetary value in the first place you can easily conclude why it lost to fiat and why it is now completely useless because a vastly superior money now exists that beats both gold *and* fiat--Bitcoin.

Why do people use shitty banks?  I honestly do not get this.  I had a US Bank account--because they offered $100 if I maintained a $1000 deposit for a year.   
I intended to keep them as I needed a bank, but they were huge asshats.  So I took their $100 and went to a much better online bank that I absolutely love.  They are responsive and don't try to dick me over like so many banks seem to do to their customers.  There are also credit unions. 
I now have 3 bank and 1 CU account and I am happy with all of them but if they even thought about pulling any of the shit these other banks do I would grief them then leave.

Bitcoins are generated by miners finding new blocks.  A block is currently found on average every 10 minutes.  Every 4 years the amount of Bitcoins that come with a new block are dropped by 50% every four years.  It started out as 50/block and is currently 25 per block, tomorrow it will be 12.5 bitcoins per new block.
A lot of people speculate how this will impact price but I dont think anyone really knows.  There is not really any examples of when a supply of something that was truly inelastic was known in advance.  What you can know is that after tomorrow, bitcoins will be harder to generate.

Bitcoin is valuable because noobs (new people) are continuing to store their value in this superior currency.

Absolutely.  It could slowly move up and down and get there over the next two years.  Or it could go up suddenly to the ATH and collapse back.  I don't know **and you don't know either**
 Do you not believe breaking the all time high would create an energy and enthusiasm throughout the community? Where were you in 2013?
I was right here with people losing their mind about momentum and price.  There was a lot of energy and enthusiasm in 12/13, but it didn't propel the price--in fact the price crashed pretty hard for 2 years and we are still less than half where we were.
People are already frothing with enthusiasm over the tiny jump we just had.  Will this cause the price to go up further?  You cannot make that statement based on the available evidence.  If you could, you could know when bubbles would rise, to what height, and when they would stop rising and you would be very rich.

If you study monetary history and look at the process of monetization it is always volatile.  
Bitcoin can be worth a "Lambo" one year and a high end bicycle the next during its moneization stage.  Once it takes over the world economy price volatility will decrease and prices will then change with market demand (as it should), but until we get there it's going to be a wild ride

Markets, and market prices, are not rigid and never changing.  I want a currency that *does not lose value via monetary inflation*.  As a side benefit to this, I see a currency that dynamically adjusts in price to market conditions vastly superior to one where a central authority creates new units (that is used for its own benefit--as inflation does not happen informally) in some attempt to keep prices what they were in the past.
Suppose due to technology and increased productivity the cost of goods and services (in terms of time and resources) falls--should I not expect to pay less for those products?  I should if the currency is not inflationary, but these economic gains are stolen by the central authority via seignorage.
Ultimately a currency that does a better job of adjusting prices to a changing market does a better job of *price signaling* which more efficiently and quickly communicates market demand allowing for a more efficient use of resources to meet market demand.

This is how a blithering idiot thinks money works.  If no one held dollars, dollars would have no value.  People hold cash for many many reasons.
It increases your resistance to unexpected economic disruptions.  It positions you well to act quickly on opportunities, and it allows you to remain agnostic and uncommitted to investments.
A company or person that has no cash reserves is at great risk that unexpected cost will cause more damage than they would to someone sitting on some cash.

That's what a dumbass thinks a currency needs.  These are more observed behavior of how people treat money rather than internal monetary properties.  Flooz can be a good medium of exchange and monopoly money is a useful UOA.
There are properties that make something very well suited to be used as a currency and these properties show up time and time again throughout history. 
If a currency has these underlying monetary properties (and has them to a better degree than the competing currencies do) then that currency will *always* rise to the top, dominate other currencies and be used as a SOV/MOE/UOA.


You should 100% check out Saifdean Ammos's book The Bitcoin Standard, but here are a few examples.
When economies using Seashells came into contact with economies using gold.
When economies using glass beads came into contact with economies using gold.
in the late 1800s when there were economies using silver and ones using gold.
I would also argue that gold lost to fiat when fiat was simulated to be a harder money than gold by Paul Volker in the early 1980s.
These examples involve gold, because most instances of a soft money getting stomped by a hard money were actually gold replacing a shitty money, but there are others.
When a shitty 3rd world country prints too much money and their economy dollarizes like Equador or Zimbabee.  US dollars are a harder money than whatever bullshit currency, so it takes over.
Lastly you should look up the Rai stones that the people of Yap used as money.  These are SHIT for MOE, because they are literally heavy AF stones, and yet that was their money until modern humans arrived and could easily produce large stones, which made the Rai stones soft money.
Bitcoin is the hardest money humanity has ever known or ever will know.  It is literally cheaper to go harvest asteroids to increase the supply of gold than it is to increase the supply of bitcoin beyond 21 million.
If anyone understands this and looks at bitcoin and the other currencies, they would know with absolute certainty how this plays out--with bitcoin sitting on top of the hyperinflated corpses of every other currency.
There is no future in which Bitcoin does not take over and crush all other (softer) currencies.

Economies grow through savings.  The idea that economic growth can only happen via debt is asinine.
You are correct that borrowing for unproductive ventures or for current consumption is going to be far more costly, but consider that this is a good thing. 
What if instead of consumer loans--which divert resources to consumption loans were restricted to those business ventures that can demonstrate a high likelihood of a positive risk-adjusted return.  That is, imagine you're a bank or other lender; you would be very cautious about loaning out your capital, but if the opportunity is good enough and has a high likelihood of success, you would have incentive to invest or loan for such a venture.
Not only will an economy grow faster with a non-inflationary currency because there will be a preference for high quality investment and an aversion to malinvestment and consumption, there will be less waste and a higher savings rate.  Many ignorant economists will say a high savings rate is bad because it is unused capital, but this is wrong.
A high savings rate provides much more cushion for unplanned economic disruption.  This is true for you at the individual level--say you lose your job or your house burns down and you have sufficient cash reserves--you are not required to liquidate your investments and an absorb the shock.  But this is also true on the scale of a company or an entire economy as a whole. 
It is savings (or deferred consumption), not debt, that causes an economy to grow

This is how you evaluate non-monetary instruments but this is not how value gold for example.  In order to answer the question of Bitcoin’s value you must first understand monetary economics.  You need to understand why certain currencies become the dominate money of an economy and you need to understand the underlying and common properties successful currencies have.  At this point you may ask some idiot economist what properties a successful currency has and he may retort something like 1) used as a store of value 2) medium of exchange, 3) unit of account, and 4) stable.  If he is an especially stupid economist he may add something like 5) backed by the full faith and credit of government.
This is like asking someone what makes a successful restaurant and having them responding that it needs to be very busy and have extremely long wait times.  The internal monetary properties a currency has is important, all of the things listed above are external properties that relate to how people interact with the currency.  If you look at monetary history you will see many examples of currencies competing and it should become clear to you what properties winning currencies have.  
One of the most important of these monetary properties is a currency’s resistance to expansion.  Let us define a money whose supply is easily increased as a “soft money” and a currency whose supply is difficult to increase as “hard money”.  When you have hard money and soft money competing, the hard money will always win out.  You may object to this and say “But what about Gresham’s law, which states bad money drives out good?”  It is true that if you have a currency that maintains or grows in value in competition with one that loses value over time, the deflationary currency will be “driven out of circulation”.  A good example of this is how pre-1964 silver coins are driven out of circulation, but what is really happening here is people are preferring to hold the higher quality money and choosing to spend the shitty soft money.  Over time the soft currency’s value is driven to zero while people choose to hoard the hard money.
Bitcoin is a harder money than any other currency—that is, it would be more costly to increase the supply of Bitcoins by 50% over the next 10 years than it would be to increase the supply of gold (or any other currency) by 50%.  Once you understand these very clear and consistent rules of monetary economics, it will become clear to you that Bitcoin is a hard money competing against vastly inferior soft currencies and the end result—which is constant with the current trend we have seen since Bitcoin was created is complete and total Bitcoin domination of the global economy.  


A currency that has interest rates artificially set and supply easily increased by government decree is poorly position to compete against a currency that is immune from government meddling. 


You understand that Bitcoin is a superior currency and therefore will continue to gain market share in the natural monopoly that is the money market until it is the supreme dominate global money.


As long as you can buy Bitcoins with dollars, you’re getting a good deal.  There’s only 21 million of them and the supply of dollars is only going to increase.

If you want to understand currency and what people use money for, you need to take a step back and look at the entire process--take a look at your own interactions with currency.
You mention the currency being spent as the function, but this is only a part of the total function of currency.
First you accept a currency, then you hold it for some time (t) until you then exit the currency.  The holding of the currency until you want to spend it is critically important to the function of money.
Money is a sociological behavior where by a society or economy accounts for time-delayed consumption and currency should be seen as an accounting scheme of which spending (or exiting the currency) is only one part.
Gold is not valuable because people spend it.

I would argue that it is a 100% certainty that bitcoin will replace fiat, because it is a superior currency to fiat.
You really should look at the history of money and understand it before you put any money in Bitcoin or advise other people to do so.  Once you do understand how currencies with different monetary properties compete with one another, Bitcoin becomes less of a "bet" and more of a known and completely predictable outcome.

Or look at technology.  There is no question I will be able to buy a better TV/phone/laptop/robotic sex doll/etc for cheaper than today, and yet people still buy these things.  People favor consuming in the present rather than deferred consumption, thus these things balance out in the market.

I understand that, but if you go with that definition you have to put a huge asterisk because that that is vastly different from the m. inflation of other currencies.  For example, if people knew what the real m. inflation rate of the USD would fall to account for that unclaimed future supply--which would be damn near zero given that the supply is really infinite.
The article is very good and made me think of m. inflation differently.  I do think it is correct, as the market should account for the unmined bitcoins as unclaimed but existing supply.  However...
in the year following each halvening the price of bitcoin has grown substantially.  If this happens again in 2020-21, I will have to consider that most market participants are not accurately accounting the unmined supply as existing supply (unclaimed though) and is rather functioning off the "circulating supply" as you say.  IF this is the case--which should not be if the market is rational, then the next halvening is going to be the first time that Bitcoin has a lower m. inflation rate than all other currencies in existence including gold.  If that is the case, I expect it will be the end for those weaker currencies

Having an asset sit idle is not a good way to maximize the amount of profit that can be extracted from it.
A person owning an asset who wants to gain as much bitcoin as possible should either use the asset to directly earn bitcoin with it, sell it for bitcoin, or rent it out for bitcoin.  That is, the person is incitivized to use it for its maximum utility.


Because idling a resource is wasteful.  Rent it out to someone who can make it profitable if you cannot....or sell it.   You don't necessarily earn a profit from sitting idle either.  Balance is achieved.  Basically the maximum amount you can earn by keeping your capital idle is limited by how the rest of the economy goes.  
Your currency will keep (or grow) its value in terms of monetary inflation/deflation, but there is another factor that is market fluctuation.  If you are keeping your currency idle while everyone else in the economy is using their currency more productively you will lose purchasing power relative to them.


The wealthy would only remain wealthy if they produced more than they consume.  If they consume more than they consume more than their bitcoin hoard diminishes.  The purchasing power of that bitcoin may very well increase, but relative to other bitcoin holders they will be losing economic power.  By contrast a serf who saves his bitcoin and produces more than he consumes will accumulate bitcoin over time.  
An equilibrium will be reached

An economy with a deflationary currency is going to be one that rewards productive behavior and capital use *more* than one with an inflationary currency.
Additionally it punishes malinvestment and consumption *more* and lowers the time preference of individuals and companies, which leads to more efficient use of resources.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:48:53

This is wonderful news for Bitcoin.  The Chinese government is saying you can sell Bitcion now, but you cannot deposit new funds to buy Bitcoin.
They went on to say that if and when this happens, people will still be able to withdraw their money from Chinese exchanges, they just won’t be able to deposit new funds.
Basically they are encouraging people to sell bitcoin but not buy it.  They are trying to force capital where they want it to go.  But capital does not go where the China government wants it to go--capital goes where it wants to go.

GDP is an aggregate number that makes no distinction for the quality or productivity of the economic behavior.  If I spend 10M to build a factory this increases GDP by 10M, if I spend 10M on coke and hookers, this increases GDP by 10M.  The former is productive behavior that will likely lead to a more prosperous future; the later is a destructive consumption of resources that leaves the economy in worse shape than it was before the consumption (resources and time were consumed that could have otherwise been used productively).
You are correct that saving instead of spending will decrease GDP, but an economy does not grow simply by undirected use of capital.  In other words, an economy is not going to do better if people start consuming more than it would if people were consuming fewer resources.  It is far more important in how those resources are used.  If they are used productively as in high quality investments, deferred consumption, and general low time preference behavior, the economy is going to be using resources and capital much more efficiently.  GDP may decrease but if you think GDP growth is an adequate measure of the growth of an economy you are way off on understanding economic systems.  


Well they don't need to be lent.  You could save up, and go in with some other investors on a business venture without borrowing.  Lending could still occur, but the bar will have been shifted higher. That is, you better be able to present a good plan that shows the risk-adjusted return is worthy of financing.  Car loans and most student loans are not going to cut it---which I would argue is a good thing.  What if instead of spending money on worthless degrees the economy directed capital only to projects that could produce a decent ROI?

Then they go forward and draw all sorts of dumbass conclusions from the constraints this label puts on their manufactured definition of money.
If you want to understand money, you need to look at what people ACTUALLY do with it.  You need to look at what currencies emerge as the dominate money in many economic situations.  You need to look at what properties winning currencies have.
You need to also look at what happens when an existing currency has a new currency competitor enter into the market.  You need to understand which one wins and why and how that process of demonitzation of one currency and monitzation of the new currency takes place. 
If you do this, you will conclude that hard money always wins when it competes with a softer money.  This happens time and time again, and it always plays out the same way.  You will also see that Bitcoin is the hardest money that has ever existed and possibly the hardest money that is possible.  You may then correctly conclude that Bitcoin will necessarily overtake and destroy the value of all other currencies.
If you do not realize this, then you are failing to understand how money works and the history of competing currencies.
You are wrong about your base assumptions of what money is and what makes it valuable.  Money is sociological behavior--it is an accounting scheme for "keeping score" between people.  It is a shared spreadsheet. 
Gold, Yap stones, dollars, etc, are all just tokens that are part of that ledger used to keep track of it, and they are all very shitty at their job.  The better spreadsheet always **always** wins, and Bitcoin is the best spreadsheet.  It's also immortal.

Price changes occur for two reasons:
1- Changes in market conditions (includes productivity increases, supply shortages, demand, etc, etc)
2- Changes in monetary supply.
Malicious or unintelligent economist often use the term *inflation* to mean *price inflation* or the sum of both 1 &amp; 2.  This term is meaningless and useless as far as I am concerned as it jumbles these two very different things together, I think perhaps in an attempt to confuse or distract people.

You're a sad little person who does not understand economics and is lacking the mental capacity to understand the simple concept I tried to pour into your tiny shot-glass sized brain.
The not-yet mined coins already exist and are known to the market, they are just not yet claimed so calling this transition of a coin from unclaimed to claim status an increase in the bitcoin supply is not quite accurate. 
I know you have a little website that incorrectly states the mining process increases the supply of bitcoins but this is not accurate.  It is more like a land-grab of an existing and known supply.  If you don't get this that's too fucking bad.  You can just be a sad no-coiner until Bitcoin takes over.  You are ignorant and I think it is fitting that you should miss out on the Bitcoinization of the world economy.

Most people are especially ignorant and spew things on which they know nothing about.  This is especially true on so I think it makes sense to call them out as being ignorant and talking way out of their depth on subjects they know nothing about.
You did the correct thing by going to the actual source law and I respect that because that is how we stop being ignorant and become more knowledgeable and something I try to do as well.
here is what the actual law (18 USC 333) says:


The intent portion is critical here, which you left out.  I will admit when I posted my earlier message I mistakenly thought the statute said it required intent to defraud, but that is not the case.  Nonetheless, there have been cases where people have cut or defaced currency as for art or other purpose and their was a case on the matter where (going off memory again) it was ruled such actions do not meet the intent test.  I will try to find the actual case(s).  In any case this is why people are able to do this in practice and why no one is ever charged with these laws with the exception of counterfeiters and fraudsters.

You may have noticed I have explained things in a curious manner to several people in this sub and elsewhere.
Economics, specifically monetary economics, is an area where most people are heavily entrenched in their bad and asinine ideas about money.  That is annoying itself but they are also really conddsneding about it and strawman the fuck out of Austrian (correct) ideas on economics.  Go look at r/buttcoin or /economics or /investing or /personal finance.  Or look at how they come over to /bitcoin to mock us like an astrologist mocking an astrophysicist.
If someone is sincere I'll try to point them into seeing money correctly, but most are Keynesian ass clowns and I will tell those people they are retarded and need to fuck off.

* If anything I think this was MORE of a risk until recently. We just saw that Bitcoin can take a fork to the heart and not even slow down.  As for altcoins, you can logically conclude that a currency with larger network has huge advantages over a similar one with a smaller network (less liquidity, etc).  You can then conclude that because of this feedback loop once a currency gets a lead over others it will retain its dominance unless another currency offers something very substantial to the market to overcome such a large economic moat.  Also, if CC  were to get replaced by CC  any rational holders of CC  should immediately sell because they have no way have knowing CC  would not be supplanted by CC 
Also see the article "The problem with altcoins"


If the dollar doesn't collapse, then it will still collapse just much more slowly.  The supply of dollars is going to continue to increase as long as they have value, and if the eventual supply of dollars is infinite then the eventual price is going to be zero.  


That kind of happened in 2008.  If this happens and a miracle save is pulled off then there will eventually be a time when the government minders are not able to save the dollar with their Keynesian voodoo.  Also, if the Keynesians are right, it is STILL better for an individual to own a deflationary currency than an inflationary one.


Their ability to restrict and  control drugs does note bode well for their ability to restrict something that can be invisible, perfectly secured, and teleported instantly.  I guess they can try, but I think it will only make demand for bitcoin to go up. 


I think the government you're imagining exists is way more powerful and competent than the ones that actually exist.  Good luck trying to prove possession on something that can disappear and reappear at will or be stored in people's brains.


This would require nation to own or buy a substantial amount of Bitcoin

What Peter Schiff needs to understand is that IF gold were a better money than the US Dollar--it would have *already* replaced the USD as a result of market forces.
It would seem that the pain-in-the-ass that is using gold as a currency is so great, that losing ~3% per year is actually LESS of a pain-in-the-ass.  That is, while gold may be a better Store of Value, it is a really shitty Medium of Exchange, and on the balance, USD wins out.
Bitcoin, IMO, will replace both, as it is a better SoV than gold AND a better MoE than USD.

Bitcoin is no a deflationary currency.  There is a fixed qty and therefore there are no inflation/deflation forces going on. Prices will go down, but that is because the amount of resources needed to produce X good or Y service decreases.  This should be expected as technology advances and manufacturing processes become more efficient.
When people lose coins forever that is deflation but that is not intrinsic to BTC.

Q: What places the ceiling and the floor on the value of Bitcoin?  
A: The Market
Btw, this is true for gold and fiat as well.  It *is* the market that sets the value for both of these as well. 
You claim I can make something pretty out of gold.  Well what the fuck am I going to do with something shiny and pretty?  It's a goddamn rock.
As for fiat, market forces set those values to, and though they take a little longer to do so because of government trying to prop them up, fiat currencies almost always go to zero.  If you have a currency whose value is underpinned by the promises of a government, especially one that is &gt;10 T in debt, you should probably get the hell out of that currency.
TL;DR Values are determined by the market forces, not some alternative theoretical use or by governmental decrees.

Even if he were to guarantee would increase in value, there is no guarantee the person holding the money would live long enough to use it.  If you get hit by a bus you've experienced a 100% loss.
Even with a deflationary currency, someone who only accumulates money will live his entire life as if he were poor and die with a tremendous amount of money.  What's the point of that?  It does not sound appealing to me.
I would think it would instead be prudent for someone will spend very little when they are young with increasing amounts as they get older.
