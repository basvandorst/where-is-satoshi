Be aware of people who privately reach out to help you with this.  There are individuals who seek out those looking to claim forked coins with a view of stealing their underline bitcoin.
If you haven’t already, before you start this adventure ensure that bitcoin is moved to a fresh wallet outside of this private key.
With regards to the error, try installing the latest version of Python3 and using that instead of the system python that you appear to be using.

Did you use the newer python binary to run it, you might need to be implicit be name?

If you run python on its own, do you see the version?  The error sounds like an old version of python that’s being used.
Have you downloaded and installed the latest python3?  If on Windows you may also benefit from a reboot for it to pick up any path changes.
Running python3 on its own should give you the version

Blimey, congratulations.  Buy yourself a Trezor wallet, I recommend that you don’t get a ledger, I have both and the Trezor is superior in my opinion.
Generate the seed, making multiple copies, use the 25th passphrase advanced option and take note of the receive address that you have when using this process.
Wipe the Trezor multiple times and test the restore, using the different copies of the seed and the 25th passphrase.  In all instances, you should get back to the same wallet (same receiving address).
Store the copies of the seed in safe locations.  It’s imperative that you remember the 25th word otherwise your funds will be lost.  If you need too, write down some clues that are enough to remind  you but, without giving the passphrase away to a stranger.  Store this somewhere else.
When you are confident with the use of the Trezor wallet and that your seed/passphrase combo restores as expected, transfer to your new wallet.  If it was me, I would do multiple transfers rather than 1 bulk even though technically it is safe.  It will give you a new receive address on the Trezor if you do multiple sends but you can use the original one you sent too again (albeit at a small cost to privacy, it would be clear to see that a single address holds a lot of coins).
Some other tips.  When using the Trezor, always make sure it’s https, if it’s not, do not proceed.  You will never ever be asked for your seeds in order, if something tries to ask you for these in order it’s a red flag.  During a restore the device will ask you for the seeds in a random order.  The newer Trezor has the added benefit that you can enter the seed on the device rather than on the computer.
Good luck and happy hodling.

Ahh okay, unfortunately you’ve got a bit of a dilemma here ... anyone performing the un-encryption could steal your funds.  Do you know the public address for the funds?
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:41:44
If you buy the newer Trezor model it uses a 12 word seed, so the 25th passphrase that I mentioned is a 13th passphrase on this model
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:28:03
Will check.  Is your wallet encrypted?
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:20:05
I wouldn’t try a repair on this yourself, if, there is as much as 8 or more bitcoin.  Seek professional help.
What’s the make of the drive, and model?
Is the wallet on the drive encrypted?
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:51:18
See my other comment about the Trezor, I recommend in your case, given the amounts that you’re talking about, I think you should buy 2 of them.  Set it up on one and then restore the same seed to the other.
Then, with the correct passphrase you should be able to access the same wallet on both.
When it comes to upgrades, upgrade one of them, verify that the funds are still visible, then, upgrade the other one.
Will give you some extra peace of mind

This is awesome news!  Congratulations.
Now go and buy yourself a Trezor, set it up a with 24 word seed (store multiple copies) and a 25th passcode (that this time there’s no hope of there ever being ambiguity).
Then, enjoy your bitcoin.

Buy yourself a trezor wallet, generate the seed and use the optional password.  Wipe and restore the device multiple times and check you always get the same wallet address.
Store the seed in multiple safe locations, keep your optional password to yourself and those you can trust.
When happy, move a small amount off to the wallet, verify all is okay, move the rest.
Good luck!  Fortune favours the brave

I don’t find it funny, regardless of amounts, these individuals are the lowest of the low.  Sorry for your loss.  At some point, most people in life get scammed and it’s a hard lesson.
Going forward, be suspicious of people you don’t know, trust should be earned.  Also, the good old saying, if it sounds to good to be true it probably is.

Like many in this thread, not sure if I believe it.  OP, any proof you can provide?  Transactions showing some of the higher transfers that you make reference too?
On what to do... I made mistakes with alt's in a similar fashion, albeit, with thousands, not a sum in the millions.  
I personally recommend that you bite the bullet and switch back to bitcoin (as most alt's convert to bitcoin).  Then, from there split accordingly
60% Bitcoin
30% Ethereum
10% NEO
Then, hold for a set amount of time, 5 years ... 10 years etc.  I think with patience you may be fortunate to recoup your original sum
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:03:17
I did this, back when Bitcoin was around $200 (post gox), gave a Bitcoin.  I did a paperwallet at the time and set a passphrase that I knew the couple would be able to workout.  I put it in a sealed envelope in a card and told them to open it on their 10 year anniversary.
To this day they don’t know what it is and it’s a regular talking point.
Worth noting, I still gave a wedding gift in case it went to nothing.
If I was doing it again, I’d instead give a 12/24 word seed with the passphrase set.

Given the high value involved, if the hard drive I would be wanting a backup as a priority, if it can be removed easily, do so.  Given it’s an old laptop it’s probably a mechanical drive so I recommend, cloning it to a larger ssd (just needs to be larger for the clone to work)
You can buy a hard drive cloner on amazon for about 30 bucks, pay extra attention to the source (your laptop hard drive) and the target (the new drive), get this the wrong way round and you potentially erase the drive.
Once you have a clone, store the original somewhere safe.
Buy yourself a hardware wallet, either a trezor or a ledger.  Setup a wallet with a 25th seed, store your seeds safely.  Test that you can recover the wallet on the hardware device before committing.
On a new laptop with a fresh install, download and configure the bitcoin.org wallet, let it fully sync to the network.
Forget all networks and ensure it’s offline, then, connect the drive to the laptop (you can use the cloner to do this).  Browse the disk and find the wallet.dat file, copy that over the new one on the new laptop.  When you start the wallet hopefully you should see your coins in the wallet.
I would then do offline transactions from your laptop to the address of your new hardware wallet, copying the transactions on a brand new usb drive between the new (offline) laptop and another computer that you will use to broadcast.
This way, your coins are never online and at risk for theft.

Buy yourself a Trezor hardware wallet, setup a seed and with it, use a 25th password that only you know.  Store the seed in multiple places.  Wipe the device, and try to recover it multiple times.  Each time, you should get the same receiving address.
Once you’re happy with the process, transfer from your uncles wallet to the Trezor.
Then, start looking into the good advice you’ve had on this thread.
When dealing with a sum like this, spending $150 on a Trezor wallet is trivial, given, the amount of safety it gives you.

Glad to help.  They are brilliant and really take away power from a potential scammer.  You have to physically press the keys and confirm with the led screen, the actions you want to take.  The private key, is never on a computer with this, the device signs what it needs to do with the key and transfers back and forth, signed messages only.
Some other tips that will serve you well -
1.  The 25th seed is an advanced option allowing you to use your own password, it doesn’t do it unless you go into advanced settings.  Any different 25th word results in a completely different wallet.  Lose your 25th seed, you lose your funds!  It’s great as it prevents someone stealing your funds, if they found your 24 seed words.
2.  As before, always create wallet, store seeds safely, check receiving address with 25th seed, wipe device, test recovery - Before using the device.
3.  Always ensure that the Trezor page is using https, if it is not, treat it as a red flag and don’t go any further until it’s resolved.
4.  When recovering the Trezor, tells you via the LED screen, the order of the seed to enter into wallet ui.  It will always be in a random order and it will always be the Trezor specifying the order.  If, you ever get a scenario where the web wallet is dictating the order, treat as a red flag.
The devices are brilliant.  Points 4 and 5 relate to a BGP network attack that took place where the Trezor web wallet traffic was redirected to a rogue server. Https didn’t work, the page was grammatically incorrect and it was asking for the seeds on the web page.  Unfortunately, it fooled some people but, if you follow the advice above you’ll be safe, should such a scenario every happen again.

Passguardian can be downloaded as a single html file, split the seed into multiple parts, store the part alongside the standalone passguardian html file, include with it instructions, also a reference to the system that it was being run on at the time, i.e. Mac OS X High Sierra, MacBook Pro 2017, Sierra browser.  You could .. even make an image of the system in some way, anything that might help someone in the future (for example on a Mac, this could be done with super duper ... if you do use imaging software be sure to also include that in the archive).
Store these on M-Disc recordables, rather than USB drives.
In the future, someone could try running the html file in a modern browser... if it doesn’t work, they have a reference there to a system which was known to work at the time.  Arguably, they may not be able to do this themselves but they would have context for getting help.

You should try recovering the password yourself.  It’s not as difficult as it sounds to try it.  I did it for a friend and successfully recovered his wallet.
I recommend Ubuntu with this - 
Read through the docs and try it at first with variations of your everyday passwords.
If you have no such luck, try getting some dictionary lists, and run it through with the dictionary lists with it just using a single line per attempt (rather than it trying every combination of words in the list)
Good luck
