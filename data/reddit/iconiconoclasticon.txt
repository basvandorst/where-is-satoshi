So there is no correlation between political system and transparency and corruption? Now this is denial at an astronomical scale.
Communism and dictatorship are shit corrupt to the core. Democracy is the best bet. It's also where innovation thrives.

Communist countries are bad for Bitcoin in the long run. They simply do not have a thriving democracy to allow cryptocurrencies to thrive. Their rulings are knee-jerk, abrupt and uncertain.

Coinbase messed up my name's spelling for Bank Transfers too. I sent a mail asking them to correct it...been more than a month. No response.
I regularly do bank transfers to them through Revolut and it works flawlessly though. I can't stop raving about Revolut's conversion rates (Pounds to Euros), which are perfect interbank transfer rates.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:55:21
The problem with SKorean exchanges is that they were charging a premium of 20% over the actual price of cryptocurrencies. Indian exchanges are no different. This obviously leads to money laundering and therein lies the problem. The government had no option but to step in. I just hope they don't impose a blanket ban on all exchanges.
It was the greed of SKorean exchanges that will cause their downfall. Let this be a lesson for exchanges the world over.

UK/EU residents can try Revolut. I exchange between Pounds &amp; Euros regularly and the exchange rates are perfect. I then send my Euros to Coinbase. Works perfectly each time.
Revolut is opening in the US too.

I have been suggesting this idea for years. People in the charity sector, at least in the UK, seem to have no enthusiasm for new ideas to seek donations using new ideas. Bitcoin is as painless as it can get. There is no investment required, little-no cost overhead, complete transparency and the money doesn't need to be accessed immediately (so no need for exotic things like Lightning).
Fund raising people need to be educated.

Being from India myself, I know the feeling. Things move at a snail's pace. ICICI is one of India's best and most efficient private banks. Imagine doing the same transaction with a public bank like UCO or PNB.
Delays are not really delays there, they're just the normal way of working. India is also a socialist country, the government wants absolute control over everything, especially money. This culture defines the way in which institutions are allowed to work, the end result being that you are dis-empowered and totally at the mercy of the government.
Why did India effectively cut-off Bitcoins? Obviously because it was a direct attack on its very lifeline - finance. Bitcoin cuts out the bureaucracy and empowers you directly. Can you imagine a greater nightmare for the Indian establishment?

@_date: 2019-06-07 08:44:09
Being from India, I am hardly surprised. India is a socialist country. It wants to have strict control over its finances. The Indian Rupee is not even fully convertible for fear that if fully convertible, people would quickly sell their Rupees for USD and the Indian currency would devalue in no time. People have little faith in the Indian Rupee and inflation in India is incredibly difficult to control.  
The laws in India are excruciatingly archaic. Even getting a SIM card draws a crazy degree of paranoia. There are practically no privacy laws and for most things, you need to give out all your sensitive information.  
Bitcoin would challenge all this to the point where the government would be helpless.

Google needs to compensate its engineers and keep its servers running in order to serve us. It needs to know us first.
Governments, at least in the West, ensure rights. Want to see what happens when this isn't the case? Visit Somalia, Saudi Arabia or North Korea.
Banks take our money and give it back to us when we swipe our cards or visit the ATM. They haven't been very honest, I must agree.
Corporations build the infrastructure needed for complex jobs to be made possible. How do you think Apple happened? If yet to come across a freelancer who has come close to producing anything remotely like an iPhone accessible to millions of people worldwide.

I agree. The Indian economy remains strongly rooted in its socialist foundation. The government tries hard to protect its market, import barriers and many, bureaucratic hurdles are many and any technological novelty is viewed with suspicion.
There is also no social benefit system to take care of people who cannot support themselves financially. People are on their own and they know it. This is what makes them financially more responsible knowing there's no support. When I see countless undeserving people living on benefits in the West because they couldn't care less, I can see the perks of the Indian habit to save and seldom be in debt. Most Indians can't even imagine spending money that they haven't even earned.

@_date: 2018-03-14 16:17:20
Money has no intrinsic value and yet it does...simply because the government dictates it. Who gives governments this authority? The people themselves. People in effect are regulating governments that regulate money and its value. People are driven by economic realities of life.
Bitcoin is a radical development in the creation of money that was initially largely unregulated. The temporary regulatory vacuum allowed it to thrive as long as its impact on the populace was negligible. But for a larger financial footprint, Bitcoin indeed needs to be characterized at least partly like conventional money. This is where the regulators have to step in.

Wall Street stinks of unsustainable greed. I am increasingly of the opinion that only Bitcoin can cut these monster bankers to size.

Money needs to be regulated. Period. Like it or not, the masses will never adopt a currency that is not regulated or recognized. You need the government on your side if you want Bitcoin to succeed. Grow up and realize that Bitcoin cannot exist on an ideology alone. It needs pragmatism and recognition, both of which can come only when it works with regulators. The Winklevoss brothers have done the right thing.

I would like to allay all fears arising from India giving Bitcoin the cold shoulder. India won't ban Bitcoin. More importantly, India is largely irrelevant.
As Bitcoin is made more and more accessible to users via consumer products like Square and Robinhood and as Lightning Network makes Bitcoin a viable payment option, the bull run will begin. And this time it will be a long one.

Completely agree. ShitCoins are a hazard to the crypto ecosystem. If every Tom, Dick and Harry keeps minting a shitcoin at the drop of a hat, the genuine coins will never gain credibility.

Fiat currency didn't happen overnight. Financial regulations exist for a reason. Cryptos cannot work independently without any regulation. They will work in tandem with fiat and have to comply with a framework.
The shakeup BitCoin is currently experiencing was inevitable. Sooner or later the world's attention was bound to be attracted. Most countries would be in no position to know how to respond to it and will try their best to put the lid on the can. Some more receptive countries will see opportunity and frame laws to absorb cryptos into society.

There's a whole mechanism called democracy. Financial regulators weren't produced overnight by an autocrat simply to satiate his whims and fancies. They were produced out of social/economic need for a mechanism to regulate money.
Of course you were living under a rock and these ideas may seem alien. If you find the idea of regulation revolting and unacceptable, might I suggest you spawn a new private altcoin and never transact with it. The regulators will be only too happy to leave you alone with your toy money.

I support banning the use of credit cards to buy cryptos. Credit money is not your money. If it's not your money, the bank has every right to deny you the privilege of buying cryptos. I don't see how can someone have the moral authority to crib over banks safeguarding their finances.
I live in the UK after moving from India. While in India, I used debit cards 95% of the time. The remaining 5% I used credit.
In UK, I've never even bothered with credit cards. It's actually a chronic problem in the West for people to live on credit beyond their means. This is how they fall into debt with no viable means of repayment.
The rule is simple: only use your own money to buy cryptos.

I'm not sure the bank closed your account because you invested in Bitcoin. I don't think the RBI directive tells banks to close accounts of people who transact in Bitcoins.
However, assuming that your allegation is true, this is unacceptable. Indian banks can be very bureaucratic and slow in reacting to consumer complaints. But knowing that it is Citibank, I don't think the bank itself is to blame for what it has done.

When the merchant accepts card payment, for every $100 he is sent, he actually gets only $97. The rest is taken by the sender's and receiver's banks and the payment processor (Mastercard/Visa).
When the same merchant accepts via Bitcoin, for ever $100, he receives the full $100. Add to that, there is no need to subscribe to a payment processor who charges a monthly flat fee.
The merchant would be happy to be set free from expensive payment processors.
60% seems like a conservative estimate.

Just the kind of news we didn't need the the moment. Learn your lessons: Do not keep your bitcoins in an exchange. Use your own Bitcoin wallet, preferably a multisig wallet.

Thank you. That was a very good answer.

Shitcoins aren't necessarily useless. They are random experiments (mostly trivial) that might generate a useful result occasionally without risking the entire Bitcoin community.
It's hard to justify the existence of most shitcoins though.

Excellent fit.

No. But that's no excuse for such exorbitant fees.

Contrary to what most people here would believe, I think it's a good move.

UK banks are actually pretty robust. The fleet of challenger app-only banks are brilliant. It's the EU-forced split of Lloyds TSB that has caused problems because of poor software development.

Bitcoin is just a transaction enabler. If the person using it is intent upon bad things, Bitcoin can/will do bad things. Just like any currency. You can use a knife to chop onions or people's head. Don't blame the knife if you are ISIS.

That's my plan too!

Market manipulation could be the death knell of Bitcoin. We definitely need the help from Nasdaq.

Bitcoin will not get the kind of push that a corporate could have given it. If Bitcoin is people powered, maybe people can also power the push it required to be entrenched into the public psyche. I think this could be a grassroot level global movement by the people to inform more people to join the revolution.

BCash will fork again on 15th-May. The pump may be in anticipation of it.

Totally agree. Roger Ver and his team of shady friends caused the BCH infighting. It made the whole crypto market plummet overnight. That fellow should be held responsible for a lot of headaches. It also highlighted how a few greedy people can become a major liability to cryptocurrency.

Good idea.
Thank you.

I'm very sceptical over the claims. Miners look for the cheapest source of energy available. Do you think all/most of that is renewable? Even if they were, aren't they robbing others of renewable energy then?  
I love Bitcoin. But this kind of unabashed enthusiasm would make us simply delusional.

If you live in UK, these exchanges are really a relic from the 80s. App-only banks like Starling, Revolut and Monzo give you the perfect exchange-rate and they don't charge a commission. I've used Monzo in India while my wife regularly uses it in the US. Works flawlessly every time.  
I see an ICE outlet at Waterloo Station on my way to work and feel sorry for this anachronistic institution. Their days are numbered.

The faster you climb, the faster you fall.  
I hope the current rise in Bitcoin price is slow and steady, not a reckless sprint bound to crash.

I think a healthy mix of belief and skepticism is required for any new system. I am glad you have a democratic mechanism in place where such debates are public and open to scrutiny. You're lucky democracy is so robust in your country.
It's a far cry from India, when some high-ranking bureaucrats and hillbilly politicians meet behind closed doors and unilaterally decide to outrightly ban crypto simply because they don't understand it. No consultation, no research and no interest.

Maybe Bitcoin is Hindu. It has countless lives. It can be killed, only to be born again.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:54:03
India. That's one paranoid country. I should know. I am from India, living in UK.India is a socialist country with strict control over its money. The Indian Rupee isn't even fully convertible. Bitcoin Exchanges have already been banned by the government and now they are introducing a bill that will outlaw cryptos outright.

What about people who use their desktops to join mining pools? I'm sure that would make a very substantial amount.
