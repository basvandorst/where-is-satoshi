i see you unscrupulous defending everything to do with cointrader.net in this thread and else where on and the thread active in concerning their business practice. I guess this is just a shill account for your company to use when ever anyone posts something you don't like, especially since i see you post alot on Canadian bitcoin topics.

seems like the only reason the cointrader.net guys are charging such a high fee is so they can create there own arbitrage opportunity across exchanges

looking at the cointrader.net order-book it doesn't have alot of sell orders. Seems like if the idea takes off there exchange will fail to meet the demand needed, what would happen then?

lol but how much did you loose like $1
The problem is you, how many times do people have to be told not to leave coins in exchanges where they dont control the private keys

im sure you have to provide some identification to zebrapay it cant be a completely anonymous transaction as fiat bitcoin otherwise it would never get allowed
