I never understood the hard-on for inflation, I mean, I get why they think that inflation means a growing economy, but it's symptom. It's like saying, "Hey when I exercise, I sweat a lot!" then focusing your efforts in hanging out in a sauna to get your target amount of sweat. 
Also, how is it so good that everything becomes more expensive for people year over year?

My questions were more rhetorical, questioning the theory behind it (yes, I have studied econ before). Have you considered not responding like a pretentious jerk when people ask questions on the internet? FFS, anyone can answer "read a book" when people ask about anything.

Well aware of that, but I'm just wondering who is buying during a nearly vertical move. I guess it's people dogpiling on the rocketship.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:21:03
Who is buying at these prices??
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:55:50
Amagi has been my go-to source for PM's. I pay with bitcoin, and then rebuy the bitcoin I spent. This way I avoid the credit card and wire transfer fees. All I pay in fees is 1% to buy bitcoin from Coinbase.

Alright Latvia! I just spent the last year there, and I'm wondering what the local population is feeling these days after switching to the Euro during the winter. Maybe there's some growing sentiment to get into BTC?

Gotta build the fence higher to keep the tax cows in.

I keep some on Coinbase, encrypted paper wallets, and a small amount in blockchain.info wallet.

With ACH being a such slow process to debit money from accounts, have you considered an e-checking technology to replace the use of ACH to buy/sell Bitcoin from Coinbase accounts? It would make it much faster for consumers and probably save you money on fees.

I live in Beijing and have never seen a Bitcoin logo in the wild or even heard any local speak of it.

If we visit sub $400 I'll be buying BTC in multiples of 3 instead of 1's and 2's!

I've been seeing a lot of Bitcoin tipping on Before it seemed only a handful of us on there liked BTC. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:45:22
Funny you mention Coinbase, their customer service, and the sloth-like speed of ACH transactions. I just messaged Coinbase customer service the other day suggesting they adopt an e-checking technology that is much faster and cheaper than ACH, fully compliant with the Check-21 Act, and is still very secure. I mentioned how this would help reduce the friction between USD and BTC in the US. I actually got a response, mainly a thanks for the suggestion, but we'll see if they actually look into it.

Could be irrelavent, but they did sign on with MyEcheck in November to accept e-checks as a payment option. MyEcheck is supposed to be rolling out their apps in January.

They add up. So yes. Thanks !

Since the news is out, is it not already priced in? Or is there a ton of money waiting to fill Coinbase's orderbook? I'd love for it to go to the moon, but I'm not sure it will on this news alone. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:06:07
Like when eBay's Braintree announced that they would be using bitcoin, or when Dell started accepting bitcoin, or when Microsoft started accepting bitcoin?

I heard you have to kill somebody to get in the bitcoin gang. "Blood in, blood out" as they say.

Thanks! Will collect when I get home.

Nicely done. My initial investment was the same dollar amount but only half the bitcoins!

I hope you enjoy the ride. I wish I had gotten in at these levels. By the time I decided to pull the trigger on Bitcoin, it had reached $500 (last November). It's been a wild year to say the least.

I find this extremely hard to believe. Either that or I'm completely heartless.

Then they're not authentic. They use MD5 hashes as checksums to prove they are the original, unadultered documents that they received.

Thanks for the response. I know a lot of it comes from experience and self-directed learning, but I figured learning CS/programming/security fundamentals will be very helpful as a launchpad for me. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:27:28
There's absolutely no evidence to back that, plus, wikileaks has released a lot of information on the Russian Federation as well. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:54:21
Let's say for instance nobody is selling, for some strange reason. People will start bidding higher to get sellers to budge until somebody finally parts ways with their bitcoin. That's the price discovery mechanism at work. If nobody sells for any price, then it's literally priceless. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:03:30
Feels an awful lot like late 2013. Hope you've got patience.
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:27:17
Funny thing about feelings... they're pretty subjective. Price action looks and feels to me a lot like December 2013, hanging on hope that the rally will continue. It's slower this time, sure. I don't have a position right now, but hope I'm wrong anyway.

Sold a few months ago around $750. The FOMO is real, but meh, I'm not jumping on the train this time. Good luck HODLERS

My thoughts on the value of Bitcoin changed drastically when I started asking enthusiasts when the last time the *spent* Bitcoin on anything. The vast majority in my opinion are hodlers and traders with an extremely small minority of people who actually *use* it. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:42:02
Thanks! Any idea how to get your hands on the USD after its been converted? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:05:24
Sounds very interesting. The site doesn't say much about access. For instance,  if she holds USD "cloud money" will she be able to spend it as USD in America?

Makes sense. Thanks!

I actually subscribe to Chris Duane, and while I agree with a lot he says about the global economy (I'm a bit of a silver/gold bug, too) I think he's dead wrong about Bitcoin. It's disappointing but also a good reminder not to blindly trust everything a person says just because you with them on a few things. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:13:44
Just entertaining the idea.
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:50:26
I can't imagine a time in recent history (last few thousand years) where gold was not considered valuable. I can, however, point to numerous paper currencies and financial instruments that have become utterly worthless. I think I'll hold my gold, silver, bitcoins, stocks, and cash with equal reverence for the time being. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 15:52:26
Wouldn't the opposite happen? If people needed to rely on bitcoin, gold, silver for daily spending the demand would skyrocket. Very few people own any of those assets, so where would they get them? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:43:42
What? He bought BTC when it was worth $600 each. He didn't buy $600 worth of BTC.

I hate to see people lose their shirts, but having roughed the 2-3 year long bear market, selling out at about $750 to buy equipment to start a small business, then watching the whole thing explode up to $5,000... yeah I kind of feel good watching it go down for once.

As somebody who completely missed the train ride past $800, please keep going lower. I want back aboard. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:54:47
It has nothing to so with other people's misfortune, honestly. Good news for me is that I've gotten enough profit from my little business to cover about half what I would have made if I had just hodled longer.

I think it's more likely they decided to auction off the rest of the coins because the price is going up, not the other way around.
