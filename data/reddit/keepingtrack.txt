No they don't. Author is a moron. It takes a lot of money to deal with precious metals. Whether that be testing and verification, weighing, eventually re-refining if not just taking metals from an approved sources list. Sitting on them if the value drops and other long-term market games. Not so much with bitcoin.

yep, in the states it's $2k if it's suspicious. and 10k regardless -- and it goes to the IRS, DHS and others care of the BSA, PA and regulations.

In the US they're already MSBs. It won't mean much until the IRS and Homeland Security step in. Even numismatic coin and bullion dealers must register with FinCen because of the BSA and Patriot Act.

Because hype is what backs and drives Bitcoin.

Yes there is for insecure wallets, like oldschool brain wallets. And if you just focus on brainwallets the numbers go up dramatically. Check against hash required to use key phrase and voila.

You mean 22k.

Was that me? If so, I'll sign. NVM, not my post history.

This is stupid and gives the miners control.

What you said is that you don't trust investment in core because their financiers who have years and years of experience in financial investments yet you support douchebag, loudmouth trolls whose experience is Mom's-basement programming courses, putting together computers and ordering mining gear.

Hi Mark, I had an account, and I still have the e-mail address, what's the process for me to contact the trustee to find out if I have coins/cash value to recover? I found some old e-mails from Mt Gox and I'm interested in doing whatever is possible to file a claim. I don't even remember what was in my account.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:38:06
Where should we keep watch at?
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:16:07
Thanks man. Do you or does anyone else have access to a DB so I don't file a claim blindly? I have access to my old e-mail addy, and a copy of an e-mail from MTGox, so I know I had an account, but I can't for the life of me remember my balance.

Any MSB is only required to report suspicious activity over 2k, or transactions over 10k. If they're reporting your shit as if it were 1099 income they should be sued. It's stored value, so no sales tax, it's not a collectible, so there's no IRS tax that needs to be taken out of it, only gains once you transfer it into cash, and just the gains.

I'll trade someone my gunbot for the cash to do it
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:10:16
Because it's only intrinsic value is electronic. Derp.

Excuse me mods, gentlemen, ladies but I have to let you know -- hell has officially frozen over.

Eh, BFL's a scam. Look at how much the difficulty has gone up. The climate isn't the same as when the majority ordered their products and generally they've been out to make money, barely deliver, give notice that they can and will screw you while doing it. If any other business did this they'd be fucked and for the most part the only people getting fucked is the buyers. I hope someone files a class action lawsuit -- agreements like theirs and their failures add up to a good case.

All survey answers are right. If you survey 5,000 people on online forums, the answers you get are true for all US consumers. Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-08-24 19:04:09
The people who bought, bought like 1-2 years ago and are still waiting. It's not so much a "don't buy from them" situation --it's a "they bought and are still waiting / being fucked" by them situation.
