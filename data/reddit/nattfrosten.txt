The affordable ones have fake diamonds, and we all know that it's important that people die for the shininess, ladies get mad otherwise.

As far as I'm aware, it's been licensed to operate as a bank by the french government, [info here]( 
Oh, seems like it's "only" a PSP, but that still should give it some legitimacy.
@_date: 2012-11-26 02:02:25
Yeah, but since it seem like it was supposed to be an economy using a small group of friends, they could all promise not to do it, and trust each other, but I guess yours is safer ^^
@_date: 2012-12-15 13:54:12
Might be worth it to mention  which has been given bank-status. Might give some legitimacy.

It's pretty funny that Tung=heavy, and sten=rock in sweden.
Tungsten= heavy rock.

Oh, I see. I must admit I do not have extensive knowledge in this area, thanks for the correction.
@_date: 2012-12-18 20:17:01
Try to find one for sale on silkroad xD
@_date: 2012-06-18 10:46:58
Please grow up.
@_date: 2012-11-26 14:20:44
Oh, okay then :)

Use satoshis? 100 millionth of a bitcoin.
That way, you can get one bitcoin, split it endlessly, and use that :)
@_date: 2012-11-26 14:20:27
I had no idea :o Where does this fee go to?
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:15:25
Also, the likelihood of it getting frozen is a tad smaller
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:21:37
Poor Moe :c

The killer pretend to kill himself in a highly diabolical plan! 
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:15:49
WELL FUCK IT I GUESS I'M INVESTING -.-
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:22:51
They can control bitcoin, which is bad, because bitcoins are supposed to be uncontrollable :)
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:15:57
You mean at restaurants? I'm not really sure they'd accept that.
@_date: 2013-02-15 00:17:59
Not, if we just could connect the bitcointip bot to this somehow xD
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:16:10
(as in converting parts of my actively used income into bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-03-04 13:50:43
Free candy probably.
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:38:48
A pleasure doing business with you :)
@_date: 2013-10-20 17:09:42
NSA has banned bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-11 15:51:54
Well, meanwhile anyone who's interested can just turn to me :)
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:04:44
Yeah, it's probably not due to silkroad being shut down
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:38:29
Lol, checked out bitcointrade, to no avail
@_date: 2013-02-23 01:48:45
No, it's "Lucifer, our lord", bunch of heretics.
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:34:30
I'd never pay/accept cash for a meal with a friend, but I'm sure it's a good idea with some modifications :)
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:56:48
Sure thing, I had to remove you from my friends though, since it'd get filled pretty quickly otherwise. Also tell your friends etc :)
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:15:43
Sure I can, how many coins did you have in mind?
edit: just add me on steam, let's not spam this thread down \^^
@_date: 2013-02-12 01:19:30
Whereever people who use bitcoins can see your post? xD
@_date: 2013-08-14 18:56:00
