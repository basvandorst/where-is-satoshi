I wish you'd just told them to fuck off and paid a pittance to the collection agency after several iterations of them slashing the debt until it hit a fraction of the original figure. Fuck paypal
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:01:23
The quality of threads is close to hitting rock-bottom.
What the fuck is this shit
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:48:06
This Circle delirium is getting out of hand.

Hahaha I love the background image on [your website](
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:59:23
Wow, I thought you were making a decent point through sarcasm when I read the title, but it turns out you just added another thread to the long list of useless and hysteric Circle threads and thoroughly and obliviously insulted yourself.
Like seriously, you didn't even make a point. Just "omg i &lt;3 curcle ne1 els??"
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:07:10
Accept defeat, you're beginning to look mighty stupid
@_date: 2014-09-15 04:52:07
Do you guys think Circle will let me blow them?
@_date: 2014-08-15 08:11:26
Thanks for the work you're doing! Are there plans to have the mixing and other services run in a decentralized manner at some point, and not through Unsystem servers?
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:13:38
OpenBazaar is a tool. What you're concerned about will take social effort and evolution to change.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:25:41
O-one whole internet?
@_date: 2014-07-12 07:14:37
Sounds like he wants bitcoin to succumb to government regulation and become some bullshit  castrated mainstream currency. Fuck that
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:35:01
i-is this what we've been waiting for?

@_date: 2014-08-03 23:01:37
Any particular reason you posted this to @_date: 2014-07-03 20:53:37
Superfluous convenience, in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-08-03 11:22:39
You're confusing a principle with a shitty entity that claims to follow/enable it.

Time is a stubborn bastion of the old guard in all matters. their job is to downplay revolutionary ideas and keep a firm grip on the creative imaginations of the masses
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:35:21
Because people want pretty all-in-one packages so that they can continue sitting on their fat asses and succumb to the same lack of principles and laziness that leads to and breeds fiat economies
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:58:22
Is this sub turning into fucking tier shit? Gold for this dumb shit? Are you insane?

Are you seriously suggesting they could start buying Iranian oil with Bitcoin? This sub is getting seriously delusional

Going off on a tangent here, how easy is it to infect a Linux-based system with a keylogger or screen capture sort of trojan?

Take a minute to remove your bitcoin blinders and consider the sheer trade volume of that market and the instability of bitcoin value
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:38:45
Hah! He fell for it 
@_date: 2014-09-14 23:31:41
Ask Circle. There are enough shitty Circle threads in this sub, thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-01 11:48:03
Google can fuck off to the trashcan of history
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:14:32
The paradigm continues towards its end-game. Not to worry, though, decentralized and anonymous Bitcoin 2.0 services will lead the future (in this case, Storj will allow for no-holds-barred file hosting and sharing).
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:32:45
Fuck off to thanks
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:42:05


Stopped stroking it there.

@_date: 2015-01-01 17:19:31
middle school tier comebacks? really?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:49:20
No. I don't think very many people actually speak the way they write. I reflected and wrote concisely rather than in a longer conversational prose
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:29:58

someone should have a bot spam that form with bullshit

i cringe so hard at these reddit tropes that feign incisiveness but are just the most basic observations possible regarding human motivation.
@_date: 2015-01-29 07:59:57
Way to reinforce reddit's image as a junkyard for the shittiest maymays on the internet. Literally worse than 9fag
And your comeback is a month overdue so its effectiveness is questionable at best
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:54:20
that's nice kid
update tomorow
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:49:21
Seriously? Unashamed corporate cock sucking? Zero substance in this post. This sub is going to shit
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:59:02
Exactly, why would Russia want to use a currency that is currently so unstable?

i have no clue what the fuck you just asked, yes i have a car and yes i heat my house. are you saying that these energy hogs could conceivably be used as heaters? when there's hundreds of them sitting side-by-side in a chinese warehouse somewhere? yea nice argument bro
@_date: 2015-07-04 20:43:02
Independent doesn't mean not having an opinion.
Edit: If you're referring to "With a NO we are not bidding farewell to Europe" - that is clearly marked as an editorial. What's important is that their biases don't hinder accurate and honest reporting. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:50:23
stop this pathetic whataboutism ffs. this sub's attitude toward criticism is defined by inertia and will be the death of bitcoin. anyhoo it's quite imperfect and a very early prototype imho
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:12:00
this is such a shitty maymay you lame fuck

The millionth iteration of a mediocre joke
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:45:26
lol is this what bitcoin fanbois do when faced with a legitimate concern?


@_date: 2015-07-27 12:46:55
irrelevant comparison. just because the bitcoin ecosystem is more energy efficient than the current banking system does not mean it is not still fundamentally flawed, especially when compared with other protocols for distributing tokens of value. 
o wait am i just being cast aside as a statist shill/buttcoin frequenter just because i dared to criticize bitcoin? is that why this comparison with banks came up?
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:22:50
what a waste of energy. is hogging natural resources and generating waste part of the noble philosophical foundation of bitcoin, the game-changer waiting in the shadows?
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:28:16
@_date: 2015-07-05 11:16:24
Fair enough. Let's see how their English reporting pans out over the long run.
