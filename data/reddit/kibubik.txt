Well, it's essentially the same thing, right?  I don't have to create any backups at all because all I need is a 12 word seed.  You need the physical paper wallets **plus** a password to those wallets.  The password and the seed are essentially equivalent, so I think this method is a bit stronger as it doesn't require anything else.

Hey, thank you for the reply.  To review:
(1) Should I be worried about this?  I send from my cold storage wallet occasionally and the program does not allow you to prevent sending from the same address, thus this clearly has occurred.  Am I right in saying that only a weak RNG would allow this attack?  How can I determine if my RNG was weak?
(2) I understand that this is playing it safe, but as I understand it, there have not been any successful attacks that would occur in a manner like this.  The malware would have to exist in the BIOS, right (in order to infect the USD boot)?
(3) &amp; (4) Understood.
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:51:14
Could you explain what you mean by this?
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:22:52
Yeah, I never actually hashed Electrum to check that it was the developer's original version.  I should have, but I think the Linux repo is trustworthy.  I mean, that's the whole point of the repo, right?
Regardless, I generated my seed, and I haven't had anything take from the wallet in the 6 months or so that I've used it, so I think I should be good.  Would you agree?
Hashing the software shouldn't make a difference for the signing of a transaction since the machine is offline.  You'd have to get pretty fancy to do any damage that way (some attack through the signing USB).  Might as well, but not a big threat.
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:52:12

The situation I have described below prevents against what you are describing.  I described a situation in which an OS never touches the internet.
1) Boot to a fresh OS, unconnected to internet
2) Load Electrum via USB stick
3) Create wallet using passphrase; store passphrase offline somehow (paper, memory, etc.)
There is no wallet.dat file to be intercepted.  The setup I described is the equivalent of an offline computer security-wise, I argue.

My only source is my own personal use of Electrum.  You can play with it yourself if you like.
I believe turning off change addresses will send remaining BTC back to the original sending address (because the program does not offer an input for a change address when you create a transaction with change addresses turned off).

What I know for certain based on my own personal use is that when bitcoins are sent from a "change address" (as labelled in the Electrum client), that same address can be used as the change address of this new transaction.  Does that make sense?

That is a solid response.  Thank you.  It's unfortunate to have to go to these lengths though.  I wish Electrum had this functionality built in.
If multiple unspent transactions are spent in the same transaction, there is not a risk, right?  In other words, if I have deposited to the same address multiple times, then spend the address's full balance at once, does this require one signature (and thus is safe) or multiple signatures (and thus is at risk)?

@_date: 2014-10-27 11:32:51
**Does my cold storage method have any vulnerabilities?**
Here is what I did to create my wallet:  
        • Boot into Ubuntu off USB drive using a non-persistent setup (i.e. it's a fresh copy every boot).  Download Electrum through the Linux software repository (ensures the software is the developer's original version).  Transfer Electrum to a USB drive.  Reboot into fresh Ubuntu.  Don't connect to internet.  Load Electrum from USB drive.  Generate seed.  
How I withdraw:  
	• I keep a watch-only wallet on my day-to-day laptop and send to my public addresses as needed.  
	• When I need to spend, I generate an unsigned transaction on my watch-only wallet and save this to a just-formatted USB drive.  Then, I boot into a fresh copy of Linux Mint (ended up working better than Ubuntu with my current machine), keep it offline, connect USB drive with Electrum, load that, and enter seed.  I plug in the USB drive, sign the transaction, plug the USB drive back in my normal OS machine with the watch-only wallet, and broadcast the transaction.
I think this is as good as you can get, right?
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:07:31

Peter, let me know what you think of these.  They are all in the paragraph beginning, "In Section 3, we derive..." on page 2.


introduce two novel concepts called the mempool demand curve and the block space supply
curve, in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.
The comma between "curve" and "in": I think that you mean to create a pause before saying which sections this occurs in, but I believe technically there should not be a comma.


useful because it specifies the miner’s cost of producing a given quantity of block space; and
we suggest that the demand curve is useful because it represents the maximum fees that a
miner can claim versus the block size he might consider producing.
The semi-colon between "space" and "and": You'll want to either remove the word "and" or change the semi-colon to a comma.  Commas are used to separate clauses joined by coordinating conjunctions.

I guess our difference is that in the past three years people would generally be wrong about these assumptions, but in the lifetime of Bitcoin what you said is maybe true. I am talking about the last three years because that is when most people have become involved.

But you won't even be satisfied at 2 or 3. Even at 10 you said you'd still leave some in
The money isn't the problem here

Partially decentralized doesn't mean much though, does it?  If there is any centralization, it is centralized (i.e. dependent on one external group).
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:15:19
Got a link!?  That sounds very interesting.
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:13:59
Are there 2nd layer solutions that are still decentralized?
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:16:47
Nice work, guys.  Despite the decreased price and the controversy in the Bitcoin world of late, you appear to have kept an unwavering commitment to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:45:15
That doesn't make any sense.  Where does all this new money come from?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:43:17
Is your entire retirement fund in bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-03 21:07:27
Sounds like maybe 60% of your fund is in a Roth account and 40% is in btc.  Is that right?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:38:11
I think Ripple overtook once early on, no?

Why do you keep giving this guy dogecoin?  Is it to illustrate the point that it's a fun, light-hearted currency?
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:03:41
You are an ass
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:07:11
You've actually gotten it all wrong in fact.
He "risked" (a better phrase here might be "paid with") his time, the cost of electricity, and the cost of CPU time on all those computers (an opportunity cost: those CPU cycles were used for bitcoin and not something else).
I'm not sure where you get fiat from in this comment. No fiat is necessary if bitcoin is the currency.
Backing up your wallet is insurance against a lost wallet. Simple as that.

I bought at the same price as you. Don't worry about this. You need to ride this out for a long long time. PM me if you need a buddy in btc since it sounds like we are in the same spot.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:19:55
That's a great idea. Maybe you should make a post on that.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:17:06
Update us!
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:51:00
Damn, thanks man!  Yeah I actually mined a couple doge a week or so ago.  I have always wanted to try my hand at mining, not for the reward but just to do it.  So I mined doge for a couple hours on my laptop and ended up with about 19 doge haha!  It was a lot of fun.
Anyway, thanks for the tip.  You guys are too nice.  Speaks a lot about the dogecoin community.  Merry Christmas!

Based on what calculations?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:27:45
What is Satoshi Square?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:35:15
Whoa!! You sent me 1000!  Ha, thanks man, that was nice.  Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:30:58
Right, but their values were at least based on facts, assumptions, and calculations.

Magical internet money for every won!!!

Wait a minute, we chose bitcoin so that we could escape the control of banks.  Isn't this putting control back into a third party?


@_date: 2013-12-06 00:27:56
Ha! Me too. Sat in front of my comp watching that price and thinking, damn there's nothing I can do to get my hands on some.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:31:26
I'm in the US. Does that change your rec?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:26:56
I haven't used gox or Kraken. What would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:21:35
Is part of the purpose of dogecoin that they are essentially worthless in per coin measurement so you can just throw them around like play money?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:18:42
Also curious.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:51:05
That's not an issue at all though. With what is your money in the bank insured? Money. It's not a problem.

On reddit, people are wary to support others' self-interest.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:08:58
Told my roommate about it and linked him here!
