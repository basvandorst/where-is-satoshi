Hehe thanks for the answer man. I think I might drop in 200 as soon as I can and just trade it in and out over time

Nah, I had my best friends brother acting as a used car salesman to everyone about it since launch. I dabbled in mining for awhile but it didn't stick

Ya see that's sort of where im at , I want to for the chance to get on this ship and actually have some assets to help move me forward in life. But it just as a layman it feels like the Bitcoin ship has sorta sailed for the average Joe

Question, with country like SK starting to regulate cryptos, by announcing a future ban on anonymous trading, how significant of a negative effect could these regulations have on the price of Cryptos like Bitcoin? And what is the likelyness of Bitcoin being able rise again as it has in the passed. I'm new to all this but aware it's somewhat of a meme for newbies to ask but I'm curious. Would it be possible for Bitcoin to drop back down to -1000 levels due to regulation and rise again? Or would such a drastic crash be something Bitcoin couldn't bounce back from to be crypto juggernaut it is currently?
I only ask because I would like to buy BTC but it just feels like I missed the ship. And I want to catch the next wave... I'm just hoping there's another wave. 
I mined for a couple weeks in 2015 and that's now worth about 200 and I can't even get it because my wallet code won't work :(
Edit:It was an honest question y'all and I'm just looking for openions. Please don't downvote.
Thank you all so much for your feedback and answering my questions to the best of your ability, I'm going for it!!
