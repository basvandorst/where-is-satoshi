You could just take out $50 worth and then not care at all if that's your logic of only being out $50 :P.

There needs to start being insurance of bitcoins. It is a bit more difficult for users to internalizes the costs and risk of bitcoins given the technological barriers to managing the safe keeping of the coins and perhaps unfamiliarity of the act of 'simply' having a secured system. 
Given that there is FDIC insurance and bank backed protections such as in credit cards, I would not be surprised in some firms pop up to secure and insurance bitcoin assets.

You should read The Economist more often. The articles are generally very good for anything that you are not an expert on. Meaning, they will provide you with good, generally reasonable, analysis that will give you a firm grasp of the fundamental aspects of a topic.

You could pose the same question to unregulated forms of insurance in other markets. There is of course an element of trust and reputation as with many forms of business.
I don't necessarily have an answer to the mechanics of it all, just that because there is valid insurable interest and apparently much risk and uncertainty right now with the bitcoins, I just wouldn't find it surprising if firms start to offer such services.

Thanks. I understand what you wrote. My background is in economics as well as accounting. 
My belief that there will be a emergence of insurance for bitcoins is not so much because the FDIC is sound provider of insurance. Of course the Fed can produce more money to cheapen the cost of insuring failed banks. 
Insurance is valuable for bitcoins because parties have insurable interest, as with most any asset. I think it is underscored even more given the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of potential users regarding the currency, in how to 'protect' their assets. 
Insurance could mean paying someone to help you secure your bitcoin wallet. Or even a firewall, etc. But I would not be surprised if firms come to market to provide guarantees as well when safeguarding your bitcoin wallet.

I found your explanation to them to be definitionally amusing.
