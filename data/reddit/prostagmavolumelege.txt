Oh then we agree on the same principles. I don't know why anyone would store their bitcoin with a bank though, a consequence of bitcoin is that a bank is not required. And any significant amount of wealth would definitely not be stored in a bank in fear of being frozen out of your own account by what ever regulation or government intervention. I guess it could happen if it was given a chance but there would be no bailing out of banks if crypto was stolen from them or they were unable to match the IOU's. And that risk alone should be persuasive enough not to store significant bitcoin on a bank or exchange (mtgox). Mtgox is a historical reminder of why people should not keep their wealth on a bank/exchange.
So in that case I guess it could happen, But I suspect it would crumble away very quickly. With bitcoin it's easier to become your own bank than to trust someone else to hold it for you.

The fact btc is borderless, doesn't require armed manpower security like a physical asset such as gold does, and the immunity from being frozen/confiscated from governments and political purposes is one of the biggest advantages of cryptocurtency. I recall some Russian bank accounts were frozen like a year ago with significant wealth.

I am a merchant. I accept bitcoin as payment. 
You are a person who has taken a loan from the bank which has issued you with a "bitcoin" from fractional reserve banking they have created. You come to my shop to buy a sofa for 1 bitcoin. When it comes to transaction time your payment would be rejected as the only bitcoin the blockchain can accept are those created by the blockchain and non other than the blockchain through mining of those blocks, that is an unbreakable rule set in stone. The banks cannot create bitcoin as there will only ever be 21million bitcoin. Even when you put lightning into effect this is not possible.
Yes the only way I can see this loan working is if the bank holds 1 bitcoin and issues loans of another altcoin at a ratio of 1:10, but that would require merchants accepting this altcoin on the banks blockchain. And in that case the best case scenario is this altcoin would be worth 1/10th of a bitcoin.
Edit: the bitcoin the blockchain creates all have a transaction history that trails down to the very block they were created. And it will all (once all 21m btc are mined) tally to 21million, not even a fraction more or less. Nothing else is accepted on the blockchain.
Edit2: if the bank in this scenario give you something that isn't acceptable on the blockchain, it's not bitcoin.
Edit3: just re-read your initial comment. That's not fractional reserve banking, FRB is that the bank can fabricate money based on the money that is deposited in them and loan them out (unless I'm mistaken). And everyone is able to use the money collectively thus increasing the circulating supply. You can't use bitcoin in the same manner.

So so need trezor and ledger to pull out more wallets esp for iota cardan o &gt;_&gt;

Just a quick read through (getting a little budy atm) the people still used banks for the gold backed bit caught my eye. Back then it would have been better security wise to gave a centralized agency to protect your gold as to keep the gold at your own home would require significant armed man power and security which incur costs. I now can keep billions safe on a hardware wallet for my use anytime and I know it can never be confensgated/seized by the government as its (bitcoin) borderless and even if I lost my hardware wallet I can still recover it without that armed man power. Plus these is no longer any physical resemblance of my wealth like physical gold would.
Those who aren't tech savvy are an issue however to deal with and I can't think of a way to get around it without a centralized option.

Hey, some people just don't make the connection some times. The question had not crossed my mind but if it did I wouldn't have assumed that would be the answer.

Normally I'd say transfer to gdax then withdraw from there as it comes the fee. But I'm not sure if they have a minimum amount of btc you need to withdraw
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:45:32
Lets say this occured. Because the coin they loan out to people can't be used as a transaction on the btc blockchain. It would be rejected as a currency. And certainly wouldn't have the same value as 1bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:21:33
I agree with you but it's still some ways better. For one fractional reserve banking will have met it's match.

There's no point in going for cloud based mining. 
Buying bitcoin using an exchange would be fairly easy. Put in a limit buy order that doesn't fill in right away and you pay very little to no fees (GDAX).
Buy as much as you are comfortable with losing.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:54:54
Did you send bitcoin to a bitcoin address or to a usd wallet address?
If I remember correctly (or i might just be pulling this out me arse) if you send to a fiat currency address on coinbase it will automatically convert the BTC to it's fiat equivalent. Sounds like you might have sent it to the USD wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:14:59
Yup, however it's still a possibility if BTC stalls due to enough miners going to the fork (if I understand correctly). Only time will tell.

@_date: 2017-08-17 22:58:25
I see what you mean. Yes currently it is easier to use banks and it may seem as if there are no fees attached with sending money to friends etc, however there is a price you pay and it's a very big price. Fractional reserve banking. Every $1/£1 you deposit allows the bank to lend around £9/$9 to other people, lowering the value of your money. It's not free. That's the cost you pay and it's a massive one. I think the point I'm trying to make is it's expensive and people don't realise the cost.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:04:05
My take is that either BTC will lower is price and become the "free money" and the new 2x will initially drop in price and then become strong. Or BTC will become stronger and 2x becoming the free money
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:33:55
Probaberly buy some from coinbase, put on 2fa to keep your account safe until you learn about hardware wallets to absolutely make sure your BTC are safe.

I can't tell what you're saying.
If you sent to the same address to the business twice from your same address then you could probaberly print out the transaction record and send it to them as proof you sent twice. 
They said only one was received  so they can't acknowledge one transaction without acknowledging the other.

GDAX (it's basically coinbase) if you put a sell that doesn't instantly sell, you pay no fees and only the buyer does. Same the other way round.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:28:12
What's the incentive of this?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:10
Even better, add in your fiat currency to coinbase and transfer it to "gdax" their exchange, where you can buy btc directly as as long as you're the maker of the trade you don't pay any fees, what so ever 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:33:44

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:55:32
For clarity these are only trades within an exchange so these transactions on the exchange between "takers" and "makers" are off chain. The only person the exchange associate fees are going to is the company you are using. When you buy btc from coinbase (or any other exchange) the % fee only goes to coinbase. When you make transaction *between wallets* that incurs a transaction fee that goes to the miners.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:32:17
Ledger, can't recommend it enough.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:24:31
Sure. Coinbase is not only a place where you can buy and store bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum, but coinbase also owns an cryptocurtency exchange called "GDAX" I.e. two sides of the same coin. If you hold $10/£/€ On coinbase, you can transfer it to the flip side GDAX. On GDAX you manually make trades on the exchange and if someone accepts your trade you pay no fees, they do. Let's make a scenario.
I put $10 On coinbase, then transfer it to GDAX. I now have $10 on GDAX. On GDAX there is someone selling btc for $11 (orange colour) And someone buying btc for $9 green colour) On the order book. You come in and add in a trade to the order book and have to wait 1 minute befor someone comes along and accepts your trade. As they accepted your trade they are classed as the "taker" and pay taker fees. And as you are classed as the "maker" you pay nil. From this point on you have 1btc on GDAX. You can transfer this 1btc into the coinbase side of things for free (remember it's two sides of the same coin). Or you can withdraw from GDAX to your own personal wallet for FREE, GDAX/Coinbase cover your transaction fee from GDAX.
If things aren't making sence go to GDAX.com and watch the exchange and re-read the scenario I wrote and it should make sence (hopefully).

@_date: 2017-11-28 22:39:05
Yes and No. If you do a "market" buy then it's exactly the same speed as coinbase, just with lower fees (0.25% for the average person). To get nil fees, the method you use to get the trade going must be longer than the going rate. This can be as short as 1 second.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:11:20
Transactions have fees. The fees will be the incentive then. By then bitcoin price should be significantly higher so the tx fee would be appropriate.

Remember bitcoin, bitcoin is doing good, it's one way. Make over $2k+ worth of trade and get BTC. If only I thought of doing this 4 years ago. O well.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:47:23
Yea the coinbase addresses change every now and then but all the addresses are all linked to the guys account. If he sent to any one of them he'll get his BTC when it confirms. What fees did you set?
