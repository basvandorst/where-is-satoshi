How to answer a nonsensical question? Bitcoin IS traceable already, so it can not BECOME so. And criminals mostly stick to fiat.

I don't "think" anything about what will happen. I actually write that I'm not sure what's going on. But it's a fact that governments since the crisis of 2008 have printed massive amounts of money. And as the article describes even want to raise inflation - and yet can't manage. Who knows what will happen if they manage to "shock taxpayers" enough.
@_date: 2016-08-30 16:20:28


Not so sure about this part. Because that's what they're doing to the extreme in the last decade - and yet it had little impact. It's a strangely ignored fact that goes counter the basic explanations of how money works.
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:58:18
How does that work though? If you make transactions, then AFAIK it creates new change addresses. How can I get those when I use the original mnemonic?  
And I guess I can make subaccounts and name them in Mycelium? ...same question then.

That can't be legal.  
By that logic they can just do a 40% haircut and prop up their profits a bit. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:22:14
I don't quite get why everyone (in the interview specifically) swallows the haircut so willfully. Would that be a typical procedure in any other business?  
Ignoring that they're not blameless: Why decide this right away, before they even figure out what happened? Why would BitGo get off the hook if they're at fault? And now the shadiness of pushing purely business losses on the clients too, just because they can't check the books. That can't be legal. Seems all a big mess... 
But nice example of privatizing profit and socializing loss.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:40:41
50% of the alts are just promises, so don't scale at all yet. Most of the rest are unused except for speculation. Always makes me laugh if the next tiny alt is promising 10.000 transactions per second, while they'll never get 20 a day. They nearly all would scale much worse (the Ether devs are aware and open about this, just nobody listens).
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:24:54
Well, they were somehow willing and able to implement many other protocols (Ether &amp; BCash). And promised instant Segwit2x support. I don't see how Segwit then could take so long.   
Do they at least have batching now?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:40:36
The core devs never declared 2MB blocks the devil or so... I think this divide of: "block increase vs zero block increase" is a bit manufactured (as you in fact seem to realize). Maybe intentionally as a divide and conquer tactic, or organically due to the human bias to divide things in simple black and white groups.  
As I understand it, the core devs argued that Segwit would be the first important step - it should be tested thoroughly. That it was just a soft fork makes this step easier  - and then more would be built on top of it.  
The other side was "no Segwit, and 8MB blocks right away". And there you have the big difference.   
Later came the so-called consensus of "2MB Segwit right away" ... but it was like pushed late into the discussion by some bankers and with a very short deadline, with no inclusion of the core devs (they say they were uninvited from the talks). This was not a wise way of working, and personally I think it was a red herring to get exactly your reaction "see, not even 2MB is OK for them". 
Either way, how it worked out proved the core devs right: 2x was a disaster in the making, but luckily stopped, and 8MB was riddled with tech trouble too. With the coming LN, the non-Segwit version will be left behind.
From my view LN looks already more promising now that I thought (was rather skeptical so far). And other improvements like Schnorr signatures will help further. A block increase to 2MB is absolutely possible if the devs have enough time for testing. I 100% agree with the conservative approach with security. Bitcoin can't afford repeated experimental hard-forks like the alts can. That's exactly what makes Bitcoin the dominating store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:49:06
No, not the trades. But they don't use techniques to tone down their withdrawal and deposit transactions - e.g. with batching which would combine several into one.  
As for the fees ... well if people pay them, they can ask for it. It's not like they have a problem finding more costumers. Might as well raise them some more.   
And to be fair to them: They get soo many more clients at this time, that it must be a nightmare to maintain and keep everything secure. Let alone deal with support. Scaling up staff isn't done over night. So other issues might be on the backburner.

Each time my parents hear about bitcoin they it's only because it crashed. It's strange.

Great pick for no.1 - it's the mantra of the moment: I consider roughly 80% of all coins at this point either scams/misleading or absurdly overvalued.    
To pick a random example: You can make a company to help others make invoicing easier... but that's not a half-a billion dollar business from day one. But even the blatant scams like Bitconnect just keep on going.    
I see it as a "rising tides lifting all boats" thing. A low tide will be coming, and we'll see which boats can actually go handle the real sea. Especially for all these ICOs it'll be a sad picture - Ethereum will take some damage if the expected 95% of those sink.     
I expect a bloodbath in 2018.

Dunno man, unless "power-users" only includes programmers, then I disagree. I started dabbling in Linux these weeks, and the barrier is still huge. I have the impression that unless you have a programmer sitting next to you, that can explain you what's going on, you'll need an immense amount of time to get anything working.  
And a ton of quite basic programs have no Linux version or equivalent. As an 2d and 3d artist that hates Windows with a burning passion, I'm still stuck with it. :/

You're not wrong. On the other hand: It will be another domino that will keep the system falling deeper and deeper. The volume doesn't seem that low if it's actually one trillion. 
The system has no buffer anymore - nor do the citizens individually. The highly praised recovery has left especially millennials with even emptier pockets than before. Let them now lose their low-wage jobs, and they're completely screwed. They can't even take credit anymore to survive.

By now I'm just waiting to see what happens when all the scams and noob coins collapse - which I consider to be 80% of the market. I hope the good ones don't take too much damage in the process. 2018 is gonna be ugly.

Gaslighting. Either you're doing it - or you fell for it. Seriously: We **KNOW** that the Trump team met with Russians in Trump Tower on the direct promise to get Russia's government support. It's literally written in emails that Trump Jr. himself released. We **KNOW** he also had twitter DM conversations with Wikileaks. We also know for sure that there were **hundreds** of further contacts with Russians. Which were all hidden from public until the press or FBI found out. 
Now there might be a difference on opinion on whether you think it's OK to get foreign election help and have secret meetings. Maybe you also think Trump himself didn't know (though that's delusional). But that's it: Russia definitely had a campaign to influence the election.It's a fact - and pointing it out isn't gaslighting.
There was no "mountain of process crime committed by law enforcement, judiciary and Mr. Obama." though. That's bullshit - but just reconfirms what I already said where you get your news from.


Dumbest strawman ever. Nobody wants open borders. You're gaslighting again.
Get off those white nationalist web sites.


That's an opinion. And a different vision on the future. Nothing to do with gaslighting. Maybe you need to look up the term?
Besides: Free health care is a thing in most of Europe. Again: Who are you trying to kid here? Do you think nobody knows that?


"The squelching of speech." WTF does that even mean? How is that any remote example of gaslighting?   
We literally had as example someone saying that there was no financial crime with fiat. **THAT** is gaslighting.

I'm not aware of a technical solution - short of giving them more room for spam. They push the costs on their consumers, and the general Bitcoin users.

Or do you feel like putting someone down? Not even that makes much sense though. Alts are down now, but diversification was a great tactic in the long run. If you pick the right projects, they still are.  
It's also besides the point: a complex balanced ecosystem of currencies is beneficial. Whether I personally made profit or not.  
If it was really a "there should be only one currency" world, then by that logic we should all just stick to the dollar.

Wow, the amount of lies in this short post. Impressive!


The most obvious one - everyone can check in 5 seconds. The vote ended 52 to 48. That's anything but "absolutely clear". Additionally it was based on false promises and a false choice (as most voters didn't know it could be a no-deal, and what that would mean).
In a new referendum the result would like more clear - last polls I found say 46 (leave) to 54 (stay).


Again an easily checkable fact: Britain is trailing in GDP growth vs. nearly all EU nations for a while now - despite the falling Pound that should've helped. Even the oh-so-terrible Greece will likely do better in 2019.  
With the absolutely incapable government you got yourself, it certainly won't get any better.

And I think it's dumb to cheer for that. That's like cheering for humans to wipe all other species off the planet - yay "Human dominance reached 100% today!".
**Having a diverse ecosystem is a good thing!** It leads to competition, stability, innovation. You can see the same in the economy. Do we cheer for monopolies? It's true for cultures also. Or are we relieved when another indigenous culture is wiped out? 
Generally the (zoomed out) trendline still holds: Bitcoin dominance is falling. And if any other complex system is an indication, it will fall much more, and that will make the cryptocurrency ecosystem resilient to attacks. If it wasn't for governments actively squashing competing currencies by force, national currencies would have a plethora of competing currencies. We would be in a better place.
And it's hypocritical. When the BTC dominance fell from 87% to 37% in a matter of weeks, no threads about these relevant news were allowed here. "Because it relates to alts." But now somehow there is a new thread for every 2% it goes up.

Because the blockchain grows much faster. That's what is meant with "scaling".

Because by definition you have to lock BTC into LN, and then get it out again. So you have to make two transactions at least. So not sure how this thing will help at the end. Maybe you can lock in LN, do tons of transactions and get it out? How long can you leave them? Do you have to make sure the receiver has the same LN contract ...  
Like I'm saying, I don't want to dismiss it. But there are just lots of issues I have not seen clear answers for.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:26:25


To the opposite though - altcoiners made money, right? Dominance is at 64%, and it used to be at 100%.


I disagree, and so does Andreas Antonopoulos btw - the currency is essential. 


Maybe it could turn out that way. But it's not a given fact. For currencies historically it hasn't been true. There are hundreds if not thousands around the world - and if governments wouldn't threaten violence against new ones, we would have many more.  
Switching from one blockchain to another is simple (and will get seamless over time). I see no reason for a lock-in.


We will see. Microtransactions might go that way with Lightning. But there will always be different use cases. Once Bitcoin is private for example, you might want one that isn't. There is also room for permissioned chains, for local use cases and other things we can't even think of yet.


I don't see side-chains working well. They need mining so have the problem of possibly becoming insecure. Also, adding features and layers to Bitcoin takes decades so far, so there is enough room for alts that can iterate much faster. Again - this is a good thing. Bitcoin devs can take advantage of the lessons learned.

Anyone remember when the same was going on with 21inc? Some strange company that got billions from VC funds for revolutionizing... mining or putting bitcoin into IoT or something.. nobody knew - but there was a daily vague hype post. For all I know it's completely dead.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:42:32


But they're putting $12 Billion into a pre-alpha software. That's insane.  
And just from my view: If they can't manage a simple send button via a centralized server, I have some doubts they'll get the most complex decentralized network ever working. But we'll see.

You might think the harm is worth the price, but you can't pretend there is no harm. Especially exchanges can massively manipulate the market - do this with well timed shorting or buying of alts and they multiply their money on the backs of small investors. Continue this forward and they'll get more and more powerful and can control the whole market... price, usage, public opinion and eventually also the mining. 
What's the point then? Additionally Bitcoin will lose it's appeal if inequality is even much worse than in the current financial system. And we know for a fact that high inequality harms society.

If you hand me some old vase or so, and I go to a market and sell it as fast as I can get rid of it, do I this legitimize it? No. I don't care, and if at all I lower it's value. That's it. 
Trezor has to decide where they draw the line. Obviously they want to provide the service their costumers desire - and free money is gonna make 'em happy. They don't support diamond, so clearly they have already drawn any line - surely they look at effort and security.
BTW. You get 10 bitcoin diamond per bitcoin.  So $350 ... which is nearly 3% extra. That's significant no matter how much bitcoin you have. On other investments you can be happy to get that return in a year. Let alone as random bonus.

Because they have bad ratings, so they have to pay a lot of debt.  
I was giving the example of Argentina, but the list is endless: A lot of countries do everything by the book, and the market still punishes them. There was no specific trigger of Argentina doing something bad currently, it's that EMs are now squeezed because of the dollar. 


Yeah, it's not specifically about the size.






Because they don't have access. They would if they could (and do if they have the chance).

While this is great for people interested in tech details, I really miss a simple video that just concentrates on the use. I've seen now several vids and articles that do this Alice and Bob spiel, and I understand none of it. My brain isn't made for this. Would I even need to know? It's not like I could verify or help program it.
I just want to know how it practically works. So far, if I understood these right, it seems unusable. There have to be blockchain-transactions by each participant to start a channel. So that's already a big investment - currently $10 per person. Certainly not useful for buying a coffee or two. And then the channels need to be closed ever so often? More fees?
So in the real world use: could I just lock a small amount of bitcoin, and use it for multiple merchants and other users? Let's say for several months, to do hundreds of transactions? Do I have to join several pools, or can they connect their hubs?   
I suppose this will only solve bitcoins problems if the ratio of blockchain transactions to lightning transactions is right. Something like 1:500 to make it economical to do everyday purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:33:02
Was considering to downvote you - just to put you on a downward spiral of paranoia.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:18:39
[Readable version]( 
1. If you’re asking which crypto coin(s) you should own, I ask back “why do you want to own crypto coins?”
2. If you answer “To get rich quick.” my answer is “Any coins, but you can also get poor quick too, because it’s just gambling.”
3. But if you answer “Because I want to own a piece of a potential future where I can control my money and send it anywhere, anytime; to know that it can't be taken from me; to know that is secured by math; and to know that it can't be undermined by politicians or businessmen.”
4. then my answer is simple: “Bitcoin.”
5. I liken what is going on now to a space race. There are competing factions playing in this race. Some (very few actually) are genuinely trying to build spacefaring technology.
6. Others see the rush of dollars and are out to make a quick buck. They care not about whether they destroy one of the genuine builders’ efforts.
7. Those of us who study this space all know there can be no global decentralized currency on a blockchain alone.
8. We know we will need continued research and development to build this tech to meet global volume and speed requirements.
9. We all know that there is now also a hype of global scale, covered by the global media, about fortunes being made in very short times.
10. But even though bitcoin is valued very highly today, it does not have to be valued highly today to achieve the long term goals it is actually working towards.
11. While one thousand other coins battle it out to be a winner of the dead end on-chain-only, highly centralized, highly vulnerable crypto coin-du-jour race,…
12. slow and steady progress on bitcoin, based in a scientific approach to development, and ignoring false marketing claims of other coins, is what will lead to a realization of the vision of secure internet money at global scale.
13. Bitcoin is where the principles of this goal are and where the developers are.
14. It moves more slowly because it moves with scientific method and in the direction of its long term goal.
15. It moves forward even while it is attacked from all around by outsiders and alt-coins that don’t have any long term future prospects.
16. It moves steadily towards the goals of the project – global, reliable currency at global scale, for everyone.
17. Bitcoin’s participants and contributors know that there is no shortcut.
18. Shortcuts like a press release or interview with the media are not high quality, bug free, secure software.
19. A hastily developed fork of bitcoin is not itself high quality, secure or bug free and it certainly isn’t continuing to be developed with bitcoin’s standards.
20. Bitcoin, however, is genuine open source software developed by hundreds of collaborators; all participating in extensive peer review and testing; developing the state of the art in this technology
21. and doing so with the highest standards of maintaining uptime and security towards realizing the goal of money you can trust that cannot be corrupted...
22. Money that won’t depreciate to serve the short term interest of a politician or powerful cartel.
23. Money whose traits don’t change suddenly at the whim of a developer or businessman’s panic attack.
24. Money that when you possess it, you and only you control it.
25. So I ask again, “why do you want to own crypto coins?”
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:20:25


It needs to be done right and securely. But many services did it already, so it's not too big of a barrier.  
Most exchanges let the user pay the fee, so they don't care much... and to be fair, they have a ton of work to do with the user explosion anyways.
* Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to? 
Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on other factors.   
At the end, I don't expect the mempool to ever be empty. If transactions are cheap, their use will go up again.
* What determines fees, to begin with?
It's per byte of information. And then it's just a market mechanism: miners will prefer higher fee transactions if the blocks are full.  
Intentional spam can be a factor here.
* Are non-Segwit addresses still able to be created, or are all addresses moving forward going to be Segwit?
Addresses don't move. Coins move. So far the wallets also support generating of the old format also... I suppose at some point that will phase out. But its not necessary.

That's interesting. I was always wondering why they don't put time on log in charts. It would easily enable you to see short term and long term trends at the same time.   
It's not a lot of data points (just two-and a half peaks) to really say it's a repeating pattern.
I think you're right with your complex system comparison. But as such, Bitcoin is mostly psychologically driven. It's possibly only a locally stable pattern that could drastically change or reverse in case of a critical event/tipping point.

And why exactly is a proof of work system needed? Proof of Stake seems to work fine - and doesn't have the energy needs. PoW was necessary for distribution, but that part of it will run out. 
Also I'm always skeptical of these "green energy will be used". It's not really fixing the problem. It creates demand, and thus raises the price for others. It can indeed be useful for down-times, but else it is still adding to the carbon footprint.

Ether by design though creates much more transactions in normal operation - so it's not easily comparable to bitcoin. And it's not like they haven't run into congestion issues. They just have decided to fix it with more centralization - as it is now much trickier to run a node with complete history for Ether.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:18:25
NXT is running since more than four years now without any security breach. Obviously it's not the scale of Bitcoin, and more audits should be done - but it has a billion dollar market cap, so would have been a ripe target if there was a security flaw.  
Additionally, it's system is fairly simple and straightforward. It's really just your stake that decides how often you can forge a block.

Can someone confirm that this is correct: With $10 million, one could easily drive the costs to $100 per Bitcoin transaction - for days on end. If you time that right, and buy Bitcoin shorts or BCash before, you can (if you have Whale-sized funds) make 100s of millions out of this ... continue ad infinitum.
Seems to me just a question of time until it's done, if it isn't already - and looks like a flaw in Bitcoin's design.

To what do you compare the value then? Did silver lose the value against currencies? Typically you would compare it to "goods and services" ... hence "inflation". 
I would think that if silver lost vs. inflation, then their losses would compound. So vs. goods and services the loss of the pound would be much higher.

Mycelium fell a bit out of favor after they messed up fees and then added ads in their wallet.

I think you should more clearly describe what you're claiming. How exactly are they manipulating?   
If banks can just control the price, sure they would do it. But the first question is: how? Just shorting futures isn't per-se an answer - that trade would only go in one direction, and Bitcoin is currently way way too small to actually let big hedge-fonts make meaningful trades. Additionally, someone has to pay the other side of the trade.  
The next part is that they would all have to conspire together to make this work. The next part is that it would be much more profitable to manipulate the price up, if they can. And the next part is that Zerohedge is absolutely in no way any sort of reliable source.

Ok, that describes the technical side of it. But it doesn't get into my question of how that is remotely like the physical piece of art. That's why I think that claim is misleading (maybe misleading yourself).
   
Reading your quote literally, then yeah - it's as easy to make a sell transaction. But that doesn't make sense as claim, because selling unsigned digital copies is even easier. But it's not as easy to convince someone of that value. All you're saying is that it will have extra value because the artist proclaimed that these 100 perfectly equal digital copies have some sentimental value compared to all other equal copies. Blockchain lovers might buy into that for fun - but I highly doubt any art market or public will find that enough.   
Let's even just assume there is a second equal service to yours, where the artist sells another 100 copies. How does the buyer know which registered batch of copies is of more value?

That is the bias I meant - you make a difference between free coins you got (and didn't sell) and coins you bought. But mathematically it's the same.

I don't get it. So you "limit" the digital copy... by saying only 100 are proper?  Anyone else who gets a hand on the digital file has exactly the same thing - except for your decision that it's over the limit?   
Ascribe.io seems handy for proving you're the creator... and selling licensing. But I can't really see how their claim of "selling digital property is as easy as selling a physical piece of art" makes any sense. I don't think the public would ever buy into that.

Really not sure what you're talking about (and why people praise it as factual). First off: That currencies lose value is stated every day in all main stream economic news outlets. It's called inflation. Nobody thinks it doesn't matter.  
It's also crazy to say no one holds currencies. People do it all the time, in huge amounts (in Germany alone, it's about **4.5 TRILLION** Euro). In many countries even in cash. Most people do not hold stocks for example, and it's only recently that the general population even participates in the stock market (and participation is actually falling). That people own cars and homes changes nothing here. It's of course a bit backwards anyways - people flee into other investments **because** they know fiat value is deflating. 


I really don't get why it's repeated all the time. Who cares if academics or have a different specific definition? Here for the discussion it doesn't matter. This makes it just a word game. What if I price something in Bitcoin? Is it suddenly a currency? (Arguably alts **are** priced in BTC). What do statements like "the Pound is worth 1.16 US Dollar" mean... is the pound now thanks to that sentence no currency anymore either?   
It's also mathematically meaningless. Whether I say "one Bitcoin is worth $100" or "$100 is worth one Bitcoin" is exactly equivalent. Again, it's just word order. For all I personally care: I do pay more importance to my net worth in Bitcoin. Does that mean for me the Dollar is no currency anymore?
It's just a question of time anyways. Let's wait until the first country does switch to Bitcoin. It would make a lot of sense to me, assuming tech like the Lighting Network fixes the every-day usability. Argentina and other EM markets get currently hammered on their currencies, although they did no major mistake on their own - it's mostly driven by USD shortages. Irans rial is crushed because the US can block them out of financial markets. One of these (maybe a smaller country) will do the switch one day, and become independent. And should that work, then other countries will join one after another when the inevitable hyperinflation hits. That itself might change the USD shortage into an oversupply - leading to hyperinflation there, and then maybe we will price all remaining currencies vs. Bitcoin. Who knows - but either way it's unproductive to block even thinking about this because "Bitcoin isn't a currency" according to some economic textbook definition.
If at all, one should question why OP picked silver as a comparison here. What makes silver special? One should pick inflation - which is a comparison to a basket of "goods and services". And versus that, for all I see (and I would appreciate if someone can double check my calculation), [the pound lost 99.9995 % of it's value](

I agree with every word he says.  And I like the calm demeanor. It's all expected marked behavior (though ideally the exchange should have waited for the books to fill).  
At the end it's positive that Coinbase **finally** allows their clients to sell BCash, and expect it to lower their price in the longer term. 
Must say, I would be poised as costumer that they lost me so much bitcoin by implementing so late.  
And I hope their interface is clear to not sucker noobs into accidentally thinking they're buying bitcoin.

So far not - but if it would be me, and I would notice that I can't access ANY of the money I supposedly owned... neither via ATMs, nor even online transactions, then I would be very curious to learn about the only working alternative.  We just have to get the word out there.  
Yes, the situation right now doesn't lend itself for a run into Bitcoin. But it's a perfect teaching moment.

If they have the choice. But the countries we're talking about are not able to create currencies that the markets or their own people trust in. Any currency Venezuela dreams up now, will likely die within the year (see Petrodollar). The population might make the decision for them.
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:11:37
They had other issues though - like locked up banks and limits on how much money you're allowed to take from your ATM. Next to it, in Cyprus, the government downright confiscated money out of accounts to pay taxes.  
So yeah, it's not inflation ... but you would have been safer with Bitcoin in those situations.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:34:08


It doesn't solve it - not at all. It's obvious that it just delays it. I mean, come on: Anyone who read the minimum about this knows that the goal of coffee-sized transaction will not be achieved by just scaling the blocks, unless you want to end up with a network of like 5 nodes.
The demand is high - and even if Bitcoin adopts bigger blocks now (let's say 2MB), they'll be full in no time. It is a route they'll have to (and the core devs said they're willing) to go. But it's a mere temporary bandaid.
It's just a technical problem that hasn't been solved yet. So far no alt coin that is already deployed has a solution - typically they scale magnitudes worse (Dash is literally just suggesting 100MB blocks), but simply don't have the same use yet.    
Ardor has a side-chain like setup that starts January, that should be a big step, but we'll have to see if that works. And then there are things like Ioata's tangle, that might completely do away with the issue, but I consider it far off - possibly years.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:24:55
If you mean the distribution there, then keep in mind that big holders are exchanges or pools. Meaning it's many holders, not one. Which also solves your minimum for forging: you can lease to a pool if you don't have enough (though anyways the barrier is below $100) currently.   
Yeh, not sure if it's exciting - not enough users do it. The reward is indeed low. But that would change if the price goes up. And you protect your holdings, which is certainly worth the tiny effort to start a node, which could even run on a little RaspberryPi with a solar pad.   
Also: it means there is no inflation.

They can't switch though. If I see it correctly, BCH is at 8% difficulty of Bitcoin. If it drops too low (let's say to 1%) because Bitmain switches, any small pool could attack BCH - destroying the value of their huge holdings. They can't change the mining-algo either.

Impossible to know for sure. But just by logic: It halved the incoming supply - if demand stayed the same, then the price would rise. And the graph seems to not contradict that at least.  
Anyways, it would be strange to assume a supply drop from 12 to 6 would have the same effect than from 50 to 25.
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:28:50


Bitmain, mostly.  
That's why I'm not even sure they bought BCash. Considering that there was a bug in the algo that allowed for highly sped up mining for several periods, they might have just raked in the coins. Additionally they have the AsicBoost advantage.
The profit they claimed was also huge. Where did all those billions go? Maybe they have a lot of cash at hand?

@_date: 2018-08-25 20:38:24
I haven't yet seen evidence of how Bitmain accumulated all the BCH. My suspicion is that their hands were tied as soon as they wanted to support the coin (to defend covert AsicBoost ... which was rational, since it was their cash-cow). They were forced to mine it, because else the coin would have been instantly attacked or got stuck. Due to the broken algorithm that would periodically pay outsized mining rewards, they received huge amounts of BCH. At the same time, they couldn't sell - else all other miners would have stopped mining either. To finance all this, they sold their Bitcoin. 
In a roundabout way they exchanged their Bitcoin for BCH. The difference is that it wasn't a choice to buy it directly. They probably preferred to diversify, but they had no exit. They still don't - and I'm surprised that the market doesn't punish them harder. Because it's very predictable that they'll have to dump at some point.
Would be interesting to know if that adds up. I haven't seen exact numbers how high the BCH rewards were in these spurt periods.

Without any plan? Just with hope that it might maybe work out?
No, I don't think that is a great idea. And funny enough: Most people wont, so you want to force them to follow you into the unknown?
Then again - it's not like there is no history to learn from. We have some evidence what free markets do. For example to the environment. The free market evangelists just like to ignore that.  The situation is bad as it is. Risking to make it worse is not an option if we want humanity to survive.


I don't have to ask myself. Because I never claimed that.


Well I didn't ask for perfection. I asked for one single try even - something based on history/evidence. We need something better than "lets pull everything down, and hope it will all self-assemble into something better".


That value judgement is nonsense, and you know it. We cannot use consent for everything. Just take one obvious example: Children. You have to force them to go to the doctor or not cross the street without looking. Even if they scream and cry. Because they don't know better, and they would die otherwise.

Your argument is the same old Nothing at Stake stuff, that has been debunked since ages, but is still repeated in every thread when when the letters NXT are mentioned.
Sorry, that's why I get bit bored arguing this same old tale again and again.






Ok, right. It's still a far cry from 30% - and it will sink as more exchanges come online. Just as Dgex stake fell, because it's not the only exchange anymore. 
Dgex can not make blockchain decisions based on their past stake.


But what you fail to explain is how they can simply "present" their chain and be believed - unless they have the biggest stake. That's why it's called Proof Of Stake.


Again: Mintpal had 30% of all coins - at that very moment. Meaning: it could have (or maybe did) achieved 51% of the forging stake. And then it had the power to replace the chain.

It depends on the country. If you think about it, the connection to GDP is a bit arbitrary. Japan has easily enough income to pay the debt back - and at the current low rates it makes sense to borrow.

What specifically is the idea of BCH? Supposedly it was about more transactions space so that you could by the good old "crypto coffee".  
Now think about this ... did that ever even make sense? Why then not use Litecoin which has even more room for transactions than BCH. Many alts are even much much better on that front. The fix of BCH would have not allowed that - 8MB is not nearly enough.  
The second possible argument was that Segwit won't work - well, it does, and now you have 4MB effective transaction space. Oh, and then it was "Lightning Network won't work". Well, it does too. And it allows you buy your crypto coffee for even less fees than BCH.
Considering that the core devs were proven right, and the BCH devs wrong. And that that the BCH devs screwed up the mining algo, we can now also conclude that technically Bitcoin has the better development, thus better tech.
In conclusion:  
- The idea wasn't serious or thought out in the first place.  
- ... it's completely destroyed at this point.  
Why should anyone even hold on to this? Whatever this is about - it's BS to claim it was ever about the technology.

Right now bitcoin's price changes buy that percentage anyways on each given day, so it doesn't have any big effect yet. But should the price become more stable (as one would predict if more adoption happens), then it means bitcoin is better for "parking" your wealth than fiat... as it inflates away slower.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:20:16


There might be problems with the prediction - but this point is nearly by definition not the breaking point. Because the mining is always in relation to the existing bitcoins. If we ever reach 100k then the market cap would be so crazy high, that $2.5 mio won't change much.
It isn't even much money in the first place if we assume a sizable part of world trade is done in bitcoin. If I remember right the US wars of the last 10 years cost a multitude of 2.5 million bucks per 10 minutes.
I don't know about the 100k, I doubt we'll get there anytime soon. But one thing to keep in mind (that I've read recently here on reddit): if for example amazon would want to trade mostly in bitcoin, then the price would have to rise by necessity. Else there wouldn't be enough cap to trade all the goods.

It's not even remotely the same. If I buy the real Mona Lisa, I have the work that the artist worked on. It's three dimensional, it has paint thickness that I wont have in prints and it has a unique history. It's resolution is infinite - because well - it's the real thing.
None of that is true for your digital copy. Mine is exactly the same as yours - there is no way to differentiate. There is nothing special about it except for your word that you consider it "one of 100". That would be in that instance the only added value. 
Maybe that's good for speculators, but not good for someone who buys it for the art.
Even for pure speculators (which I would see as a very different thing) it's questionable. I don't even think the trust element is gone - for all I know, you can register it on other platforms. You can still sell additional "limited" prints and whatnot, effectively watering down the value.

Depends on many factors - you don't have to stick to my example numbers. If you sell only one thing, lets say a house, then even a 40% drop in 15 minutes would be enough to break your business.

Good that you spell it out then. At least the common pretense that it's against their leaders is gone then.
By your logic btw it is then illegal and falls then under the definition of terrorism: To hurt the general population to create chaos and regime change.
It's also immoral. And pretty clearly not a good way to get positive change - as starving a population and threatening the country never really worked. 


How about agreeing to the nuclear free zone that Iran proposed. Easy. Just that the US and Israel decline, because they want to keep their bombs in the region.
Besides, the sanctions are much older than the nuclear bomb scare.


It wouldn't be a threat if it's for self defense - which they obviously would need, since they are under constant threats from the other side. 


I think it's pretty clear from the last lets say 50 years, that the US is the threat, not Iran (I believe they haven't attacked anyone in the last 200 years).
This is btw. also the polled opinion in all surrounding countries ... because they have the direct experience.

Not sure what exactly I have to explain. Proof-Of-Stake makes the basic concept clear. I told you that you can run alternative chains, but with no stake, there is no gain to make. You have a 720 Blocks window for attack - then you have to begin anew.  
That's all.
If you're interested in details and formulas - read the whitepaper, which is extensive and well readable. It addresses "nothing at stake" in the last version I checked.


I have yet to see any consistent outline of an attack that does not necessitate 50% of the stake. At which point it is a known attack - and one that is next to impossible to pull through.  
There might be "Jokers" out there that only want destruction - but certainly that investment of likely tens of millions of dollars is a hurdle.
The plan is to implement Transparent Forging this year, which raises the stake to 90%.

No, in a PoS scheme everyone gets richer the same way. I don't know why people have such a problem understanding percentages - but that's how they work.
In fact in the PoS scheme of NXT for example, the earnings are 0.5%. Which is a laughable amount, and makes nobody rich. It's simply chump change for supporting nodes.

Yeah, I'm kinda repeatedly trying to make that point to people... so maybe I'm wrong (since I don't get much reaction to it) but: I don't see what makes this IPO so different from other schemes. Why is this one commonly praised, while others are viciously derided?
Thinking here: Premines by the developers. Hated by everyone, but same thing unless I'm missing something - the initial devs just take a huge chunk of funding for themselves (on the back of first investors).
Or small IPO's like NXT: Original dev takes basically nothing, but the tiny group of initial investors do the distribution, gaining much of the income.
At the end - to me it kinda sounds all the same. In fact Ether directly takes 100% (judging by the current amount actually more than 150%) of the initial cap for themselves - since we can assume the price will not rise much, rather fall on real release.
Other cryptos work on smart contracts too - they have half a year at least to beat Ether to the punch. What then?

Unless they make it specifically a contest by contesting the name "Bitcoin".
I'm surprised so many people don't get what is simple: Alts are OK. Forks are OK. BCash was an attack though. Not OK! 
They tried to steal the mining with some trickery. They tried to discredit the original developers. They tried to attack the tech by proclaiming that Segwit and LN won't work. And after all this failed, they're now still trying to attack the image and branding of Bitcoin - downright stealing it by stealing the name/website/twitter-handle and even offering to buy moderators on They try to even take over the founder, by pretending Wright is Satoshi (abusing the fact that Satoshi can't fight back). But at least that makes it easy to see how delusional they are - because everyone with two brain cells can deduct that that's not remotely believable.

Depends what we mean with "as of late". I was surprised that the Gox debacle has not led to a deeper crash. But since several weeks we know they're gone for good - the price stayed stable. So I don't see why those old news should press it down now suddenly again.
In fact that 30% of the funds have been "found" is good news compared to them being in hand of some criminal whale.

I got an email the other day about a survey for research into bitcoin, because I run a webshop in NL that accepts Bitcoin/alts.
Most questions were specifically about whether I would like it if my bank would handle my bitcoin, and if I would switch to their service depending on what they offer.
It wasn't from a bank... rather from a university, but made me thinking that there might be more behind it.

I'm an avid reader of Taleb - and I have the impression the people that throw around the "antifragile" word, are not. Bitcoin has not proven to be antifragile. A 5 year data set is also too small to make any such via positiva judgement.    
And I doubt it is at it's current state. As we see it shows a resistance to evolve, due to lack of paid developers and fear of change.
If at all, then the crypto environment is antifragile - it has much more properties that are similar to other systems. For example that any one currency can die, and others can take it's place.    
Problem is, if Bitcoin dies, it deals a major blow to all cryptos.

If a bank is not safe enough (supposedly a deposit box, as btw. Antonopoulos uses too) , then you can attack him for anything.

I really think you should take a look at the whitepaper. Your attack was described as "history attack". 
What you're planning is:     
-buy 200 million NXT     
-split them across lots let's say 100 addresses     
-wait one full day (so they become forging balances)     
-sell them again     
-set up 100 nodes     
-now you need to edit the timestamps in your blockchain, because a day old blockchain won't be accepted     
-hope your chain get's picked up     
Now I think that could be an attack vector (the one for which EC is to be the safeguard). But it's hardly free or easy. You risk losing your massive investment.     
I'll check in the nxtforum how much blockchain editing is even possible - if not, then it won't work at all.

Seriously, it's great that you've all read the blurb from Taleb's books. But get a grip. 
Bitcoin as in the currency can't be argued to be antifragile in a meaningful sense. We could rather talk about it being the turkey somewhere before thanksgiving. 
Having not even 5 years of proper use behind it (data), Taleb would never agree to pull out such predictions. And he would put it into extremistan - which means it's prone to massive shocks.
Now about bitcoin in small case - and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there we could argue about antifragility. Then again, that still relies on that the core idea/code has no weak point.


They don't enhance its antifragility - but its resiliency.

That is a confusing point to bring up. It turns the former argument on it's head. It is then the investments that make the people rich - not the PoS currency.
Plus: We have that issue with any currency (unless inflation is higher than investment returns).
 


If you have 0 $, then you get 0 interest. Again, that is not wealth distribution. 


Sure - but the question was if PoS makes it worse. I argue it makes it better since it is bitcoin's PoW that allows investments that outperform the deflationary currency (see your point above).

I disagree. The indicators do well. GDP and such. But since they contain the financial sector - which is not useful for anyone, those numbers mean less and less.

If Bitcoin goes down, then all cryptos will suffer massively. We should all work to protect the whole ecosystem of them if we want them to succeed.


That makes no sense to. The miners also become richer. Exponentially so, as expensive gear outmines many smaller investments. The PoS miners just grow their stake linearly - everyone the same.

Point taken. But those alternatives must include Point of Stake algorithms. There are several proposed or implemented in alts (as in Peercoin). 
Or possibly less energy intensive Proof of Work schemes (no idea if those exist). I mean, there must be setups possible that do not demand that waste. 
Should bitcoin be more ecological than established banking, then they are terrible also. It still means to take up other alternatives if at all possible. If we want to save the climate, then standstill is not enough - we have to drastically reduce emissions.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:03:42
Agreed. You can mitigate the risk with many small transactions or whatnot. It's just that his blanket statement is wrong.
If you have one transaction that your business depends on, then the tiniest risk is significant. And with the short data range, I don't think anything meaningful can be said about how the tails look. I would even doubt we can already conclude the volatility is sinking.

And the turkey predicts will get fatter and fatter until the end of time - since he got food every day so far.


Which I didn't claim. The point though is that Bitcoin can break. And since it's a single interconnected system, damage will spread extremely.
Bitcoin has many features that Taleb is warning of generally.
The comparison with airplanes is quite good. If one crashes (irreparably) they fix the next ones. That's not possible with Bitcoin. Possibly with other cryptos - though there it might not be possible if for example the proof-of-work idea is flawed.
Time will tell - after 50 years maybe one could say with some confidence.
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:50:11
I dunno - I find all those claims so obvious that they don't need backing up (at least not if it's not a scientific paper).
Let me just take the first, because I have a personal aversion to stating obvious things. I think the rest falls in the same vein:
"Bitcoins are not just good money, they are the best money. The Bitcoin network has the best monetary policy and the best brand."
Bitcoins can only compete because of better monetary policy. It's the major selling point - it's what 99% of this reddit is about. If you make a list of bitcoin properties versus typical fiat policies, nobody in their right mind would pick fiat.
Fiat has historical use/experience behind it, plus perfect adoption, plus the banker establishment, plus governments with armies. That is huge.
That Bitcoin came so far is because it has superior monetary properties.
So if you don't know that, and neither the properties then I guess you fall in the category of people the article describes as "you should just read more".

I think this is just envy driven. It's the same pattern when no-coiners hate on Bitcoin.

But only cheering when they go down, but being silent when they go up is hypocritical.  
Alts have their place. And everyone should be happy if there is a good ecosystem of cryptocurrencies - this makes the system more resilient.

(Actually there were deflationary periods in Britain in the 1800s, and as far as I've read, they were no big problem).
I would also doubt your "prophecy" part. Deflationary money let's me rest assured that I'll have wealth in the future. Inflation makes that a struggle.
One might even take more financial risks, knowing that the pension won't inflate away under your feet.

The mining?
The returns are not linear to the investments - they are exponential. The bigger and more expensive the miner, the more returns you get per $ investment. Thus the rich get richer.  
Someone wrote the number recently that $100 investment of proper mining gear can outmine $100.000 of normal laptops.

Too many "ifs" there to tell. If we assume that the money is gone for good, then a lost key would be the best option for the bitcoin network. And a hack might still be better than the option that the (US?) government can just take whatever it likes and keep it. That means they can control the network at some point. Separate hackers might not be.
Again: I like none of the options.
Lost keys that might be recovered (as Mark hinted they're still hoping for solutions) might be the best of all worlds.




So how is that a better option? Sounds horrific.




I agree - but that's just speculation. There must be some law someone knows.
Actually btw. Britain has such gagging orders that even forbid you to hint at that you're gagged. It's crazy - if China does that the West would ridicule them.
It's totally absurd that we don't even know if it's the US or Japan meddling there - or none of them. 


They moved in with elite squads and helicopters. We're living in a mad world.
But yeah overall: It's hard to say anything specific. But bitcoin might get saver against hackers. Fighting against all governments seems much harder. If they can act that way, that would be really bad for bitcoin.

You are misinformed. 
The clustering is used in "extraordinary cases". Most of the time the longest chain rule applies - just as with bitcoin.
You also ignored my "it's not even implemented". Which means it can't even be used always - it can only once it's in the code.
Also btw - the user decides which clusters to trust.


The real effects PoS has:  
- No 51% attacks (basically making them near impossible, plus with the planned Transparent Forging feature raising it to 91%).   
- No 16 gallons of gas burned for every mined unit of the currency.   
- More people support the network/transactions, since it is easier.
 


How is it not? There is no centralization.

On another note: Can't those massive pools just switch currency? So if this massive amount of mining power would just switch to LTC, it could take it over in a heart beat. Even more so with any small alt.
If that doesn't already destroy all confidence in crypto, then it could use the massive earnings to attack BTC at the end again.
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:26:04

You missed the point where 0.5% interest of PoS is no good investment at all. So this already makes your arguments void.
Secondly its absurd to blame PoS for the utility of money. That dynamic works be the returns from PoW, PoS, or any other investment.
Not that I even fully agree - there are also instances where a little money for the poor has much utility than the same percentage for the rich. But anyways - it doesn't matter for the topic.
I digress about your mining logic - one of us just doesn't get it apparently.
To me all your points get moot by the simple logic that higher investments have much higher returns than low investments. It trumps all other arguments.
That at some point Bitcoin mining will not be profitable anymore will end the spiral - ok. But that's just a new problem coming up for PoW.

I'm not arguing that fake chains are possible. I'm arguing that anyone would accept them. First of all you chain is old, so the time stamps wont be accepted. You need to tweak that and then what you need for your attack is a huge network of forging nodes that use your chain, so that you have even a chance to forge a block so as to create a fork. And for that you need a stake and you have about one minute.
EC is a fallback if there are too few nodes.

If you can't, then I don't see how you can attack.


But we had this already, didn't we? If you now only fool the new nodes, then you can't take over the network. And that was your plan.     
In the timeframe you have, you'll be lucky if there is one new node coming online.     
You need to fool the 260 or so currently active nodes. And they have no interest in accepting your bad chain.
Secondly - can't a new node not also look at the timestamps? If they get two offers for blockchains, can't they just simply pick the newer chain (so not your several month old one), then there is no problem in the first place.

You can read a discussion about this here: 
And from this  :
"Nxt has 2 types of checkpoints - fixed and rolling ones.
There r 2 fixed checkpoints:   
1st one at the height when Transparent Forging was activated. We need it coz previous blocks contain an intentionally injected flaw and can be easily rewritten.   
2nd checkpoint was added when Nxt switched to 8 decimal places after the point (satoshis). I don't know why it was added, it's related to core development process and doesn't influence Nxt security, we can live without it.
Rolling checkpoints r generated by every node. Actually it's not checkpoints, a node just ignores blockchain reorgs deeper than 720 blocks from the top block. We need this trick to get rid of a possible attack that was described in the original Nxt thread by Cunicula. Later, when we completely implement Transparent Forging, we'll remove this code coz TF provides much better protection."

I think it's a beautiful theory, that fits the Occam's razor principle. Because all other explanations have huge gaps or conflicting logic. Neither "government took it" nor "hackers used the malleability" added really up. But if he took it back then, and just lied all the way through to today, then everything falls into place.

You're moving the topic. You suggested what Satoshi thought back then - and I disagree with your reading. It stands to reason that Satoshi did foresee farms - but not these huge pools.
I personally find it odd to talk about working self-regulation, when in fact Ghash had to be pulled kicking and screaming from when they reach 50%. Took a month or so. And then we have this issue every couple of months again.
That attacking two pools at the same time would be tough is not a very strong argument.

Should ring some alarm bells if all he is saying is bringing up cheers. There are obvious holes in his story. 
The rich for example already don't want to pay taxes. If they don't even have to give the little we force them to, then how exactly will we finance our society? Yes, it's not nice to force people to do something (or trick them via inflation). That doesn't solve the problem that they are unwilling to do otherwise.
This Obamacare bashing is nonsense too. Government provided healthcare has the best outcomes. He has to provide a better solution before dissing the only one that has been proven to work. The US privatized system was way worse then the now mostly-privatized one (and it's still worse than single-payer).
The most obvious hole in the "government is the devil" story, is that government and taxes is what enabled all the basics that bitcoin relies on. Computers, the Internet - all this comes from government research.

I don't even question your standards. It's just that by now you jumped from one extreme (to state outdated  information as fact repeatedly) - to the other where you don't trust the users, the developers or even the released source code.  
Do your standards only apply to others?
If you find independent analysis, I would be interested to read it. I am not aware of it. I don't even know what you mean with "notable independent party" - but I'm no expert, just a normal user. You can also test yourself - it doesn't seem all that hard. 






Satoshi had this privilege too. And he used it.  
By the way: AFAIR the NXT creator (BCNext) did not keep the BTC he got. I can't find a link though.






It's as verified as it can get considering we're dealing with hard to trace ownership.
You can follow the distribution here: 






Ok. "The requirement to have equipment doesn't mean it's not impartial. Everyone's equipment is treated the same by the protocol."  
Problem: Not everyone has the same equipment. Or the funds and means to acquire equal equipment. So obviously the outcome is unequal. The winning miners will make more money - racing even further away from the others - potentially exponential.  
So the PoW process is not impartial - as it relies on resources. In fact it's perpetuating inequality.






You keep moving the goal post. Now it has to be an outsider of NXT, who has to be credible and obviously an expert - but can't write too complicated language.

Somebody could get it - wait 10 years, and then attack it, no?


Here comes another thing that I get conflicting answers about when looking it up/asking: Can a wallet become outdated and unusable?
If I (or a thief) have an old wallet. But I did transactions from that address with another copy of that wallet, then what happens to the old one?
If that doesn't do it - how do I make it intentionally invalid? Is the only way to start a new wallet with completely fresh addresses?
This whole thing is tricky, because having no backup is also not a good solution. There has to be something reliable and convenient when using the wallet every day.

Stop repeating your "you need trust" line a hundred times. It makes no sense. My node trusts the current stake. That's the point.
If what you're saying now is: Dgex could have attack the chain in the past. Then maybe. I even doubt it - because 100 million NXT is still not close to 51%, especially not back then when more investors had incentive to forge.
Even if we assume it was possible: By the same token I could say "Bitcoin was weak in it's first three month". Probably any old computer farm could have taken the network over. 
Obviously it would be nonsense to now claim that as proof Bitcoin is doomed. Things changed - there are more smaller pools now. As with NXT - there are more smaller stakeholders now. Networks have to grow before being reasonably decentralized.

Good piece. Very logical - good ideas in there.
But I'm kinda left with the question: Why didn't it happen yet?
And isn't capital control (which you mention as option for governments) an possibly effective tool? I think it basically works for the Argentine Peso - you can't sell it anywhere, so how are you supposed to make an earning with selling Bitcoin?

I think his argument for Bitcoin being hard to displace is wrong. Companies that got investments for Bitcoin infrastructure could switch to other currencies fairly easily. The tech behind the alts is most often not fundamentally different.
It's more a question of the network effect. BTC is established among users.

You're missing also (besides that there was potential information about him), that it's not easy to sell 50 million NXT. No exchange has the liquidity - and the price would have tanked for months - so that the $400k right now are not a bad deal at all.  
Also: Bter started again calling for a new reorg. That was another pressure point, because he had to risk it all.
If they know who he is, then he is in trouble - I don't think Bter would have to stick to any deal. They were blackmailed, and can rightfully chase him still. So all he can do then is maybe hide the BTC, go to prison for a couple years, and then use the cash when he gets out... or so.    
Still, people would chase him till the end of time.

That's true. But getting 51% via buying is basically impossible - and would be stupid if you then crash the currency.
Now pooling might work, but it is rather easy to move out of a pool. There is no incentive to stay in a bigger pool (from a certain threshold on).

I don't get it - China is now 7% of the exchange market, why do people still freak out about this?  
My guess is this has not much to do with China at the end. Next week they swim back from their ban again - and guess what - the price wont rise the same way. Meanwhile all the news from established investors moving in doesn't do anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:12:35
Well, it's also a bad common practice in politics to attack more on on style than on substance.
That's your first half - the other is about facts that might be twisted, but don't change the outcome. How does it matter if China stifled or ended trading? What matters here is that it made people sell a lot. Doesn't make sense to call it a lie.
Neither does it matter for the argument if half a billion or one billion is the loss at the very end. At some point it was actually a billion - and in a couple months it might again be a billion.
For the CoinLab allegation, a reference was provided. So we know the claim existed.


You conveniently leave out that it was 750.000 BTC missing. That is very hard to believe. Especially if it is claimed to be through repeated small malleability attacks. 
I would also call all this speculation. But at this point we don't have much else to go on. As far as guessing goes, this one is the most convincing.

I don't have that entrepreneur-peer-group that you seem to have. So though some of stresses you describe sound familiar, others seem foreign. If I would have four friends trying (and more thinking about) killing themselves, I sure would get depressed too.
I won't be telling you anything new but: Entrepreneurship is not the end of all things - many people strive for completely different goals. Live a good live, have friends, maybe even spiritual goals - or just create for fun (music &amp; art). And many people are not even in the spot to be able to worry about such higher goals (which is not always for the worse). Maybe it would be good to actively try to break out of the peer-group - get more influences from other life styles.

I call BS on this (as on pretty much any other point).
There are a hundred ways that the alts and Bitcoin benefit each other. Just to name one: The alts can innovate where Bitcoin can't. Any proven innovation can then be incorporated into Bitcoin.
Secondly, if all that were true, then Bitcoin would have no chance against established Fiat currencies. Just think of the network effect it has to overcome - and the limited resources.   
The truth is: Different currencies have different use cases.
And anyways: Prices don't rise parallel to the money invested. So there are way more complicated dynamics than you put it there.

Yeah, the situation is quite different. We have precedent that it won't spell doom for Bitcoin - and now there are lots of alternative markets out there.

We're seeing the promises of the Internet slipping away, because we've letting it become shackles by the NSA instead of a tool for freedom.

Yes: Supply and demand, I would say. Maybe some people are able to buy the Bitcoin and keep them - but by definition the Remittance leads to a bigger flow into the country then out.
Think of you being a local bitcoin trader. So you buy Bitcoin with what? Local currencies? Who is supposed to take this off of ya, you can't sell it at an exchange.

So.... how?
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:18:27
I don't get it - why would the amount of Bitcoin usage tell us the price? Is there really such a direct correlation?
For all I see, the price is decided on, by the exchanges. So it's just people saying "oh I'm willing to pay X $ for that". Usage would only very indirectly influence that, no? When I get BTC for daily usage (or if a merchant gets them for buying) would that even typically go through an exchange?
Looking at the unpredictability of the exchange rates: My guess would be that psychology and gambles play a much bigger role in the price at the moment than any fundamentals.

Your analysis might be ok. But your conclusion has nothing to do with the result. Who cares if it's a 94% chance of the price moves only 1% or less? That doesn't make it an "insignificant risk" - it's the tails that matter. If there is a 0.001 % chance that the price moves 90% within 15 minutes, then it's a huge risk to a business.

True. I'm reading now extensively about Bitcoin since two months. And I'm still confused by the safety part. How are average non-techy people supposed to use this?
I don't get even how this guy lost his coins. Isn't the backup encrypted?
And even the people here in the thread seem to not know if the blockchain wallet needs 2FA or just one password... I find their site anyways severely lacking easily accessible information.
This general situation has to be fixed - else it will just get worse if the value rises.

I think everyone who goes to use bitcoin will profit from this. The question was though if it will distribute the wealth down to the bottom. If someone poor buys bitcoins and uses them for goods, then he wont profit as much as a millionaire who buys with 100k into it as a long term hedge.
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:18:58


It's an empty slogan. Nobody can even know what it means, because no one ever even lived by "Traditional Republican values".
I mean - what tradition? The good old days were severely racist. I'm sure you don't keep that tradition. You apparently are not keeping the Christian tradition. And no one ever gave the "fiscally responsible" idea even a shot.
Go ahead: Name me the year of the tradition you follow. And the actual points. Because you only listed empty phrases that no one ever lived by. "Bearing arms" is btw. not a value in the first place.
If you found some actually half way consistent system of values, great - you're probably the only one. Hence: In no way could I have known what you meant. And hence: Unicorn.
@_date: 2014-04-23 09:07:47
Nonsense. There are lots of things you can invest in that give you more than 1% per year profit. It would be stupid in that scenario to hoard everything in this currency.
Secondly - the poor would also earn 1%. So where is the wealth transfer?
In such a system the inequality would sink over time, since the shareholders have to sell for incoming new adopters.
To the contrary, it is the mining system of Bitcoin that allows the rich to invest their earnings and then outperform the average person. A simple old laptop, while costing maybe 1% of a professional mining rig, will not create 1% of the mining results of the rig.

I like this article about it:
And I'm getting frustrated by the hostility towards alt-coins. It's creating these in-groups: each group has to love their own coin - and any innovation from other groups must be bad...

Most innovations I can think of came from the middle class. Which is not surprising when one considers that innovation always needs some investment and room for risk, that the poorest of the poor can't afford. 
For one, all that is said, was (and is) true of the internet. Although by now, few would contest that the poor profit of this invention as well. Information was democratized. 
Think of mobile phones - communication was democratized. 
Bitcoin will do that for transactions.
The price is already a non-issue. And the hardware barrier will get lower. I can't wait for the SMS transactions Antonopoulos mentions sometimes. That will be huge for the unprivileged.

Of course not. 
Some countries DO pay for child care and time-off for parents. And rightly so.
Your view is taking no context in account. Property doesn't come out of nothing - it is in part created by society. Property doesn't have value out of nothing - what value would it have if society would break apart? And most property actually "does things" - affecting society and the environment.   
It is entirely just and rational to have a tax on property so as to sustain society, make sure there is a future so that property keeps value - and to mitigate harm done by some property.
@_date: 2014-06-14 11:27:35


Ok - I indeed don't get that point. Wouldn't you then just look at which chain has the most coins forging? Which is where the name "Proof of Stake" comes from, no?
Which is exactly why a stake can only start forging after 1440 confirmed blocks.

I don't ask you to trust anyone. The problem is that you make false claims - and at the same time ask of others to perfectly prove any claims they make.






So it is that way. You can just trust yourself - and that's basis enough to tell it to anyone like a truth. Other people can then have go and check if it's not maybe just made up.


Well, again you place theory over outcome.
Satoshi profited way way more from his clear advantage in information.
 






Which is exactly what I said.






You just don't mind the problem. To my eyes is clearly an issue there if the rich profit exponentially more.


You refer to impartiality in a very narrow theoretical/academic sense that just doesn't apply much to the real world.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:18:15


Don't play dumb. I was bring a specific examples: Like a small child that wants to run on the street. You would yank it back by force. Similarly you would not let your child resist getting a vaccine if there is danger it would die otherwise - and you would hold it's arm against it's will if necessary.


You didn't restrict it to institutional violence. And anyways you still argued against my point.
If you want to talk insulting, then I feel like it if you either ignore or never read any basic thoughts about anarchism. These questions have been talked about a lot. There are lots of examples where institutional violence is necessary (at least if we don't talk about an utopia 300 years ahead). 
Do I really have to bring obvious and well known examples like the police?


I don't agree. There are clearly instances where children act stupid and an amount of force is moral - in fact an obligation. If we can't even agree on such basic obvious points, it's hard to discuss. And I would see it as further example that you're talking about a fairy tale. 
 






I actually appreciate that you as the first here answer to specific points - but again, I must think you play stupid if you pretend the only way of force is with a gun. Please think about why Apple suppliers have to install "anti-suicide-nets" at their facilities.

Sure - but the question was "could it be stopped". Fractional reserves couldn't be stopped with real money, because asking everyone to hold the real cash was impossible. Besides, fiat could be printed.

Well, the random-word approach was not picked because it gives better protection. But because it's much easier to remember - you can't leave out that part of it.
So for a brain wallet they are much more practical - and in fact it is much easier to get more characters in there than lets say 30.
Your other points are correct - but still mathematically not an issue. If I pick from common words, then if I string just enough together, the entropy is still super high, since the base is much higher than picking out of 26 letters.
Actually (since this started about NXT), I got the new NXT client today, and they have just added lots of safeguards now to prevent mistakes. They give advice, warnings, good defaults - including a password generator. 
Users can of course still make mistakes and such. I think it's a valid concern.

I talked to someone from China, who is in Bitcoin, and she's convinced that the government will soon crush anything Bitcoin related over there.  
China's influence on the price is underestimated by most still I think. If this fear is the general sentiment in China, then that would explain the slow decline.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:17:16


I really doubt that is the best option.
If the government can just take a a million bitcoin because it feels like it - whereas 99.999% of the users did nothing wrong, then we're screwed.
Who stops them from just seizing all coinbase assets? Or whatever other service they feel like?
Isn't the story of bitcoin being above the government falling apart then?
Besides: I dunno about gagging orders in Japan. Can they gag them so much that they can't even say they are gagged? It doesn't add up - that would make it even more of a huge government overreach. 
Even the Kim Dotcom story didn't work that way - and that was more serious for all I know.

Well yes, but vast majority of the network does know what the current stake is. You might end up on a fork - but only because one node falters, doesn't mean the whole network is busted. 


Lot's of things. You can read them in the whitepaper.
Current stake for one has a time stamp. There is also a next forger, so the next forged block will be the current stake. Which is why you can't just come on with one node an your fake chain.
That's why your reasoning about Mintpal was wrong. You claimed it proved your "history attack" - while in reality it was a possible "current stake attack" (besides dooming Vericoin's exchange rate forever).
I mean here is to state the obvious: If really all I need is a copy of an old chain to destroy the network - then why didn't it happen yet?
I'm sure you could even get a nice bounty if you can execute your attack on testnet. Or just do the attack, which could make you rich also - better do it now, so the harm is limited (and nobody gets rich before you).

I've read as much about it as I can comprehend as non-programmer. The nxt devs say the "nothing at stake" problem doesn't exist there. The stake is at stake. So far there has been no successful attack - despite no.3 in market cap.
Though, I cannot render a final judgement on this topic.
The incentives in PoS generally are better: You don't have to worry about protecting hardware investments. You only want to protect your currency investment. Even loosing out on fees is no big issue - they are very small rewards anyways.

Skilled? How can you say that still? Gox was problem-ridden all the way through. The whole thing was a hack - and stayed that way until the end - when it crashed horribly.
If we assume that there was a hacker doing this, then this Mark was extremely unskilled for not even detecting it for years. Let alone fixing the problems.
If we assume that Mark was the hacker, then he was obviously doing a bad job at that too. People noticed back then, and looking at the data it's amateurish at best.
There is no scenario where Mark comes out as "actually skilled hacker".

It just takes time to develop all this. For the transfer times maybe alts will be the solution. Litecoin and derived alts are already faster. And 2.0 alts like Nxt can be basically instant).
The "it's your fault" comments about Gox are annoying I'm sure, but they have a core of truth. That's not mutually exclusive with that just as with transactions the exchange problem is worked on. The suggested solutions, like proving the holdings sound aweosme - and I think that's the innovation that even goes beyond what banks do. Let alone if we really get decentralized exchanges.

Always find it funny when that is used as argument. It's totally circular: Gold is only valued as jewelry because its valuable.
There are tons of alternatives for gold - even some that look indistinguishable (not that jewelry has to be yellow for some magical reason).
In reality gold has little intrinsic value - all it has is scarcity and consensus.

I don't see this as assault. Just as a failure to understand bitcoin.
Dunno where I've heard it (maybe from one of the bankers that did an AMA here), but I found it logical that many bankers see bitcoin as a chance. While it is a risk to them, they can bring a lot to it and gain a lot from it.
Mostly I think whats going on is just what happened in many professions before. The innovators came from outside, and the insiders were not able to understand whats going on - because they knew too much about the old system.

NXT is open source.

It's not stated as negative about those people. It's stated as fact about the current state of affairs.
That current state is a outcome of a process. And if you're thinking it just happened to be randomly 8 old white guys ending up on top of the chain, then you're delusional. Or you could also think white guys are just superior.

Just a thought: NXT is actually planned to be a basis for alts on top of it (not so much a traded currency itself). It will have instant transactions soon. 
That might be a handy route to go, using the tech while saving the hassle to develop an own alt.

@_date: 2014-08-19 19:02:48


Yes the checkpoint is moving. And no: You can't just create your own chain. 


First google hit: 


So your plan is:
* Pick one person.
* Make some deal with them.
* Somehow isolate them on on the network, so they only see your node(s) &gt; goes on your fork
* Send them fake-NXT - but get some goods from them.
I'll check back with the nxt experts/devs of what they think about the attack.
I think this special case is what "economic clustering" is for - if nodes are missing, certain nodes get higher priority.


How does PoW recover?


TaPoS - as in TransactionsAsProofOfStake? I dind't talk about that, and don't know much.
Maybe you mix it up with Transparent Forging (which I mentioned) - which is a deterministic process. It should deal with the issues you mentioned, but since it's only a plan, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:46:13
Really there must be some dynamic that creates this pattern of people dealing with these with massive sums like I wouldn't even handle a 10 dollar bill.
I remember some hacks - like the BTER one, where they had everything (worth of a couple million dollars) in hot-wallets and used the same passwords across all systems. Or this guy with 1000 BTC, saving the password in plain text on drop box.  
Maybe it's because they're crazy risk-takers in the first place?

You're not reading what I write. It doesn't help you to mine several chains.  
"Nothing at Stake" does not apply to NXT. The stake is at stake.


With your theory it should basically be free and easy. So you're saying then there is zero motive to do that easy attack?
Again, if you have a consistent idea, go apply for a bounty.
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:50:03


You don't prevent forging of multiple chains. But again - you miss that we're talking about "Proof of Stake". If you don't have 50% of the stake on your side, what's the point of supporting different chains? 
For any attack like this you also btw. only have the 720 blocks. So if it didn't work, you have to start fresh after halfa a day.  
Notice also that you're destroying or own holdings if you constantly attack NXT.


What? Are you suggesting to spend on one fork, and then jump to another? Your spending would be gone then. 
But let's say I'm missing some hidden logic there, in that this would make any sense: Go ahead and do it. Either double spend and get rich - or if you prefer ask for a bounty to pull it of on test-net.   
The chain has not successfully being attacked so far.

Hm, if he thought he can get back only through the commissions, then you have good point.
I suppose that would have been unrealistic anyways (does someone here know how high the percentage was, and thus how long it would have taken?). 
But maybe he hoped to buy back quick through loans or investments. Then the quick spike made it impossible.

B: I understand that he is legally in hot water, maybe guilty, partly in a gray zone. But simply: I don't have to believe in someones complete innocence to think he should get a good defense.     
Without a good lawyer he stands no chance - and will be made into an example. That's why this support for him is the right thing. And because this is new ground it might benefit the whole bitcoin system.


You miss my point. You don't have to say he's guilty - all you have to do is to repeat those claims and thereby help the government in spreading doubts and character attacks.

I thought the microtransactions idea was awesome. So I'm happy crypto will solve it - just give it two years and it will be better and more anonymous that what flatter did.
@_date: 2014-10-08 13:33:41
Quite badly researched article. First and foremost: Even Gavin Andresen as bitcoin dev said that micropayments will likely never work with the bitcoin blockchain. So if at all, it would have to be some alt-chain or side-chain or whatever.
Secondly - there is flattr... a microtransaction service for supporting web content. It had all it needed for all I see. It didn't work out. I think that should at least be addressed - why did people not feel it worth using, and why should that change now?  (I thought it was great, but gave up on it)

Yeah, I mean it's a young crypto - lots is changing every day. 
I asked in the NXT forum to make sure I give you 100% accurate information. This is what I got confirmed by one of the devs:
Nxt is open source since early March. The public bitbucket repository (   is always updated with the source of every public release, at the time of the release. The full source is even always included in the release package itself, and can be recompiled by the end user by just running the included compile.sh (or win_compile.sh) script.


Yes, sucky but no way around it with pure PoS. Compared with Bitcoin though, the original creator did not keep a stake.






Well, it's based on knowledge and equipment really. The first that know of a coin can outmine everyone. And once you have a mining farm you have an advantage that is hard to overtake.
For a average person mining bitcoin is basically out of reach.






That's what I mean with theory and reality. In academic theory it was impartial. In reality it totally wasn't and will never fully be. With new coins it's always worse - also because huge mining operations exist now.
 






Yeah, they still have it AFAIK. NXT doesn't but hasn't been successfully attacked. The developers say you need 51% of the active stake (the forging stake) to begin an attack. The "transparent forging" feature that is currently in development will bring this figure up to 91%.
Which makes any such attack much less possible than for example a attack via mining. Because it would be unaffordable.

Fantastic. Guess it took only two months until Falkvinge was proven right about the ridicules laws the gatekeepers will cook up.
Really liked his first comparison with the book the most.  
Financial industries will lose their gatekeepers privilege - but even more so: the people will also start understanding how finance works when they can handle their money themselves. I.e. if people see that a currency that can't simply be printed still works, then they'll never go back believing the old tales.
Incidentally - the reason for banning bookprinting was in a way valid: It was widely used for "bad/frivolous" means. Pornographic content were the first big successes. The same way they will use valid concerns today, to hide their real intention.  
The thing with the blockchain is that it gives even more direct power than books give knowledge. Early investors will be rich, thus instantly more powerful. It wouldn't surprise me if the fight by the elites against that would be even stronger than back then against books. Scary.

Google never had that. The + worked in other search engines, in google it used to be automatic: any word you type is in the results. Which, like I said, is what gave IMO it the edge.

I think it doesn't. You can't simply pick some old time stamp and decide that's now the current chain - unless you have 51% of the ''currently'' active stake. Dgex does not nearly have enough at the moment.
The NXT chain is locked after about 1 day, meaning there is no way back.

Is there in all seriousness no possible solution via code?
That's hard to believe. Has someone even tried to start a discussion about solutions?    
To somehow limit bundling of hash-power for example?
Or: I know that current Proof Of Stake solutions are questioned by the Bitcoiners... but still, with the amount knowledge and coding prowess in that group it should be possible to come up with a working PoS scheme and use it for transaction verification.

You would make easily 5% in any other normal investment. So anyone who would put their money in such a PoS coin would be an idiot, and would in fact get poorer. How does that not destroy your whole point?
     
.    
     






Thats absurd. If you find a principle that can take it into account - be my guest. You can create an super successful alt-currency. 
     
.    






Sigh. See above - you're basically attacking any and all investments.
Anyways: If I give 1 more dollar to a starving child that had only 1 dollar before, it has higher utility than the second million for a millionaire. Then again it's crazy to then conclude PoS is good. 
     
.    






If I would see any logic in your statements I would change my opinion. 
     
.    


And I clearly and logically countered that by stating that the higher returns would just get re-invested. Which perpetuates - and speeds up the cycle.
The only argument you have against that, is that in the far future mining won't work anymore.
Until that very point the problem is worse in PoW, and at that point, PoW will have a new problem.
Why do I even have to explain that? It's a well known issue.
     
.    






I said it's illogical to **me**. There might be some higher logic that I'm not able to grasp.
Digress means, I give up - that mining conversation had ended its utility.

Wow, fantastic research!

* All exchanges should make this data public. That would go a big way to prevent such blatant manipulation.
* People who do Trading Analysis should really reconsider what "patterns" they have been analyzing all last year. Hard to imagine that anything reliable comes from such rotten data.
* I suppose we can forget any major moon rallies, since they were artificial?
* then again, the current rate seems even more positive considering that.

only 99 addresses hold more than 10,000 bitcoins. and slightly over 10,000 addresses hold 93% of all bitcoins are held by ~200,000 addresses
Are some words missing in this sentence? I can't quite make sense of it.
I am surprised though, it doesn't seem too bad if I read the chart right. Only one account has over 100k BTC and only a 100 have more than 10k? The inequality in the US-Dollar world is much higher.
Then again - most big hodlers would split their addresses up, so its not an accurate measure.

Hm, that's interesting - so could it be that since the shorting seems to only recently getting popular again, that this explains the long BTC depression?  
Meaning also, that the people who depress the price also made the commitment to buy again. The more shorters the more the price has to go up?

I've got this checked in the nxtforum, so that the experts could confirm:


You can't actually. Also, no block will be accepted if it is 720 blocks behind the current height. Which makes your attack pretty much impossible - and most definitely unprofitable.
And (as you said), you can't edit the blockchain either.


The effort. You have to operate 250 separate nodes, on separate IPs, using a large amount of stake, to defeat forging probability across your "network" and generate lots of consecutive blocks... and do it all with higher cumulative difficulty than everyone else before 720 blocks pass and make your attempt totally invalid.


Considering above facts - you need both: fake stake, but not older than 20 hours, plus nodes.

Depends on how he sells, right?
If he sold them to someone in a back room deal, then no one would know of it. The market price would be unaffected. The other party could slowly sell.
Downside: Someone would know of it... and it's a lot of money.
He could also have sold them to people on his own platform. Since Gox typically grew, he had demand and that at the highest market price.
Though I don't know if that was enough to get rid of all of them - or quick enough.
That's why I think he mixed: Sold some to friends, likely most on his exchange - and some on other exchanges.

I didn't say they will kill it now. I said they'll add the possibility if they can.
The other part you write is true, and it doesn't contradict what I said. But neither we or they really know where bitcoin will go. My bet is that they want to be future safe. The US does everything it can to get control of oil - even start wars. It does everything to control currencies - so they will not let bitcoin self-control without a fight. I mean, that's what the elites are about, right? Control.

Not sure what you mean by that. My point was that this proves that Wall Street is mightily volatile.
Also I'm not saying we should ban Wall Street. Obviously thats not possible. But we have to change the ecosystem so that we're ready for them moving in. I.e. update the blockchain code. Bitcoin and the alts are not there - not by a long shot. As you can see with the current massive Litecoin manipulation. 
I find it a bit odd that people cheer now for Wall Street joining. While before everyone cheered for Bitcoin as way to evade their manipulations.
@_date: 2014-05-18 16:49:47


Really don't like this argument - it's just not thought through. Clearly it's worse with mining: Wealthy miners get exponentially richer not just linearly. Then they can buy more coins, and so control the money supply. 
Also, I think a proof of stake coin would be a stupid investment for anyone. It's like 1% typically interest per year. Invest in any stock or bond, and you outpace that by a magnitude.  
Or obviously: any crypto is way way more volatile than this 1% over a year. You might just loose 90% or win 90% - no matter if what kind.


Is that a fact? Power reduction is outpacing the rise in difficulty?
Also I doubt the idea that Bitcoin will have no bureaucrats or rich people wasting money.

True. And personally I'm also frustrated by the attitude here towards other crypto. 
Sure - everyone likes his home team, especially if you have money invested in it. So do I, and I'm well aware than I'm biased (as I'm using NXT mostly). That's why I'm not expecting that people would impartially research all alternatives - it's just not realistic. But seriously: Why vote everything down that even mentions other cryptos exist? Even any services that support alts next to bitcoin. Let alone any mention that an alt might have found an improvement for any specific problem.
The true enemy is the corrupt fiat system! The differences between the alts are negligible in comparison.  
Bitcoin will also learn from the experiments of the alts. And nobody can assume that Bitcoin as it is now, is the end of all means.   
Cryptos can and will coexist - exchanging between them in decentralized ways will become trivial and seamless. There is no reason to build fences in our minds.

A typical mistake to ignore the fat tails. As bad as the speculators may be, they are not killing Bitcoin. But if your trust in GHash is misplaced, they can just shut the whole thing down. And they can decide which code updates will be accepted. Which gives them crucial power over the whole system.

But it's the investment OUTSIDE the currency that is the problem. Not the hoarding. So PoS does not create the issue.
Are you even reading the thread you're replying to?




I must think you're either trolling or your logical thinking is challenged.


The result is not the same.  
PoS: No redistribution. Everyone gets 1% more, and everyone loses 1% because of value loss (due to the fact that everyone gains 1%. It's called inflation).  
PoW: Redistribution to the wealthy. Since they can afford a higher percentage of returns via mining. While the poor lose value via inflation due to newly created coins (and flat-rate transaction fees). 
@_date: 2015-05-24 10:43:26
Well, I see their problem: They can't use Bitcoin as-is, because Bitcoin itself doesn't (and according to Gavin never will) support Microtransactions. The mining is necessary, so that via some trick they say they can do, the reward can be spread across devices.
Not sure how that works - e.g. how a device that didn't mine a block yet can spend without the blockchain. And if that's how they do it - via complex workarounds that don't use normal transactions - then I don't see why they use Bitcoin in the first place. Looks so far like a terrible hack, just to have the word "Bitcoin" and "IoT" both in their business plan, because it's hip with VCs right now.

They don't make all their money because they have smart people (though it helps) - they make it mainly because the game is rigged. Because they get free money from the government. Because they have access that normal people don't. And because they can scam everyone without any punishment.

You're setting a high bar for information - considering that you're spreading completely unverified and outdated information about five times just in this one thread. Where did you cite any source?  
"Many people said" is the Fox-news way of arguing.
Anyways: Knock yourself out. It shouldn't exactly be hard to verify. Download the current client - as it includes the source code. Then compile it - and look if it's the same result as the precompiled one. Voilà.


And it's not the NXT-creator's fault that only a few people were willing to join the IPO.  
Either way, you're right with what you say - but you're not getting my point. I would say: You're theory oriented and I'm result oriented. 
If by all indicators the inequality seems worse in Bitcoin than in NXT, then I don't care if the theory said it should be better in Bitcoin.


Do I even have to point out the obvious flaw in this argument?


There has been some:   
So far the NXT has proven to be robust - I consider that also an independent verifier.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:10:24


Are you sure your information is up to date? The delayed release was only on the beginning - they changed that a month or two ago.


It does change it, in that it's not "mining" in any way.  
"Impartial mining" is a nice theory - doesn't exist in the real world though. Especially not with the new alts: they are nearly all substantially mined in the first days. Maybe it was with Bitcoin and Litecoin - since they were so early that it took years to get attention. But I have doubts. We know that Satoshi has a massive Bitcoin stake. How was that "impartial"?
That IPO's are a problem is something we can agree on. But it's a problem all coins have. Again, NXT's distribution is better than Bitcoin's - so reality trumps theory for all I care.


That's not something I have any expertise in. But why do you think do PoS coins work then? Did no one care to attack them?

That aside: That claim is only true in the abstract. As soon as you look at reality it never turns out to hold any water. Mostly its the white politicians screaming that - turns out, they never work now. And since they're mostly born millionaires, they never had to before.

That's how it works in NXT - and though it was counterintuitve for me - I now think its a safer system after reading a lot (it removes some steps, so makes it less fragile). A long passphrase is unbreakable.
But people with a normal wallet might pick bad passwords (or not even set one up), and once someone gets access to the the wallet, they can bruteforce it easily.  
Or they lose the file completely, and then it's also retrievable.

I think the whole setup is flawed (including in your link). If you're in the hand of people who will torture and kill you with no qualms, then you are already in a losing position. Secondly the link seems to consider only a single hidden volume.
The setup is doubly-flawed since they apparently are willing to torture you to death... but then if they find no hidden volume they let you go. Well, if you have that terror regime and they apparently had enough reasons to think you're a dissident and torture you, then they won't let you go anyways.
Let's think more realistically though: The US won't torture millions of people to death. The point of the whole exercise is that they basically have no proof - and not even a reasonable suspicion that you have hidden keys/volumes. In the game theory setup from your link they would have to torture everyone to death... which is why it's not a strategy that would work (or could be set up in any halfway legal way).

I just can make no sense of it. It seems psychotic - he is so competent and beloved that people buy shares of a company that they have no idea of, just because his name appears somewhere. At the same time he must be incompetent or an evil schemer for not knowing the inner details of their management (which even employees in the same room didn't figure).

Yeah, that's the trick I'm referring to. But how do the workers send transactions back? Sounds to me like they need a second ledger.
And the question remains why they don't just put a mining farm up and then send the rewards to the chips - would be more cost effective and would save the asic part.   
I must really miss a crucial part of the puzzle - but so far no one mentioned it.

It's laughable because values does imply that there is any kind of consistency behind it... or that anyone follows it. 
But you know:   


...except when it comes to the military - then there is no funding limit. Oh, and capital punishment - totally fine for government to have the power to kill citizens.


Except when it comes to oil companies. They have to have their share of subsidies... as do farm corporations. Of course corporations also should grow as big as they like fully inhibited.
They can also buy and rape common goods - like the environment. 


For white people.  
....so they can defeat the goverment, which at the same time they support to give billions of military budgets to.


Sure. Do I even need to point out who ran up the budgets?  
Also of course - Republicans stop anything like education and social safety, food stamps, environmental protection and anything like that, which would be fiscally responsible because it would save future costs... those are bad.
And the best when we get to the Christian values they babble about every day - while supporting wars, torture, killing prisoners... wanting to bear arms, and sucking up to rich people and kicking the poor.

Thanks - an interesting talk.
But doesn't address my points either.
 Let me be clear: I agree government creates problems. But what is ignored by all these talks is that government also solves problems. If you remove government you also have to provide replacements for the positive sides of government (and taxation).
Health care works best with single payer. That's what the evidence says. Come up (and prove) that you have a better solution. Science works best with government funding (computers, internet, airplanes).
Government is needed to stop corporations from destroying the environment. Taxes and such are needed for police and law, which enable our modern society ... the list goes on. Defense might even be included.
That bitcoin would just make this all better without any planning, is magical thinking.

Only tens of thousands of bucks per bitcoin? That would be your middle ground?
I would call that super successful. I think very few see Bitcoin as replacing all currencies anywhere in the next 20 years - a coexistence is much more logical.
But - I do not see it just standing at the current level. There is no small Facebook around. Those network based services either become huge or tiny.
Bitcoin (or what comes from it) will never die, but I see something like "either tens of thousands" or "around 20 bucks" as a dichotomy that makes sense.

But you trust the code. The code is vetted by a third party. You also trust your computer. It's made and the OS programmed by third parties... so is your router. The list is endless.
The very idea of Blockchain.info is in the first place that you actually don't trust them with your private key. So the "everyone has been warning" line is a bit silly - because it has less third party involvement than other alternatives - and has been recommended as such.
The usage of the blockchain btw. wasn't even the issue. Blockchain.info uses it too. It was the interface towards it.

How would a trustless and decentralized USD-BTC exchange even work technically? I don't see it.


Didn't know Counterparty had it already. Would be curious too.  
[NXT has a trustless decentralized BTC-NXT (and LTC-NXT) exchange]( - more alts are in the works. It's beta still, but works already quite smooth - did some forth and back - surprisingly simple to use.    
+ Advantage: BTC deposits/withdrawals are as fast as transactions allow - I think most exchanges can't keep up with that.   
- Biggest problem: IMO the transaction times of several minutes, which means order setting and cancelling is much slower than one is used to. Interface is different too.   
Might take some time, but instant transactions are in development, as is a better interface. And one company thinks about offering NXT-asset &lt;&gt; fiat exchange. But I don't think that part can be trustless (and it's not decentralized then).
Seeing how promising this is. I think those exchanges will soon sprout up left and right.

In fact, other platforms could start trading that share right away - whether Overstock likes it or not. Just look at NXT's multigateway: They're trading BTC. In the same vein they or anyone else can just issue an Overstock-gateway.    
Bitshares has a 10 second block time I believe - so people might prefer that.

You just underestimate what's going on here.
We know for sure: Silk Road is threatening the business model of the police state and the massive agencies. [Because they rely on the War on Drugs]( We also know from past examples that they are willing to put up nasty fights to protect their power and funding. 
We also know that they are going full on against Ulbricht - gaining evidence illegally and most likely cooking up murder charges.
We also know that they have this social-media attack program.
So now the only part of speculation here is: Did they use the program here in this case?   
It seems nearly absurd to think they didn't.

To me it sounds like you're just throwing words around. No stake-grinding or nothing-at-stake attack has been done. They are not profitable - i.e. nothing-at-stake would only work if you actually would put incredible amounts of money at risk. POS works safely - you're free to prove otherwise.   
The article you linked mostly talks about mining new coins. But Bitcoin is getting close to done with that anyways. Then it's a moot point. Which is exactly true about the "....all of these early-adopters become ultra-rich" - well, that's true for Bitcoin then. So are the rest of the issues mentioned. If for example he counts all cryptos as the same blockchain by his logic - and that marketing is the new POW, then Bitcoin by all means will also have to spend on marketing....
I dunno, that article just sounds confused - the thousand brackets and terrible punctuation don't help.
Do I think Bitcoin should become POS? No, there is strength in the diversity of cryptos. It won't happen anyways if already the small Segwit fix makes everyone's head explode.

May I ask: are those coins actually coins with value (as in Bitcoins or such)? Because then things get weird. 
Some content providers i.e. musicians I would love to tip with money. But in my interactions with friends - when I want to thumb-up their opinion for example - I don't want money to play a role. It really feels awkward (corrupting in a sense) that we would push money around to each other then.
If those coins are mere tokens, then its different. Then I would call them differently. The name "Coinflow" really suggests not a social network - but a content rewarding network to me.

Vericoins problems are unique (for it being such a young currency). There is no 30% stake of NXT in one place (the biggest stake is 0.5% on Bter). I dare say: Any currency would collapse if one guy suddenly manages to steal 30% of it. That includes Bitcoin.
And yes, POS has a 51% of stake vulnerability. That's been known since the start. You're not describing anything new. Well Bitcoin has a 51% mining vulnerability - and that threshold was reached before.
So is Bitcoin now a "currency built on trust"? Better sell right now.
A feature planned for later this year will make NXT 91% safe against stake attacks.

If you talk about the "just create your own blockchain in seconds" - it is not as easy as you make it sound. There is encryption going on. And the whole blockchain has to be consistent. So maybe the NSA and such can - but you most likely cannot.  
Also again, you only have half a day window - if your chain is different beyond block distance of 720, then your target would deny your block.
Similar is your network attack that I broke up in the steps. The answers from the NXTers so far (no dev though) is that if you have the capabilities to isolate a single target on the network, then you probably don't need the money anyways - all you can steal some goods you bought basically (comparable to your 25BTC calculation - you would need a real big catch to make it worth it).

It's better than trusting 1 server. From then on it's just a question of numbers - should BTC multisigs allow more servers, then at some point "decentralized" is appropriate.


Go ahead. The more solutions the merrier.  
I would assume that the multisig limitation is a barrier for this too. And you will need an additional blockchain - either an alt/metacoin or side-chain.

I don't follow much of that logic. Nations don't join because they speculate on Bitcoin winnings - they join for usability. 
Earlier adopters will have higher risk, the price is the trade-off for that.   
Late joiners don't get "BTC at much higher cost" - the price will be stable as by your definition. So they'll just exchange one currency to the other.

I'm just getting annoyed to see all those 40 threads ___after___ it's all falling apart anyways. How about warning before?
Where are the threads about Ripple and Stellar for example? To me the only difference is that they don't promise a $20 floor. Else: They're both 95% premined. They're manipulating the supply to be on top of Coinmarketcap. They're completely centralized (see [Stellar simply switching to a single server]( when they were attacked). They're flaunting [big names]( and [banks]( to pretend legitimacy. Yet just as paycoin they repeatedly get [positive coverage]( from the news outlets.

But it's called "fractional" because you don't just move the money around - you multiply it. So you get 10 bucks from A - and give B a 1000.

I agree. People concentrate way too much on the coins - also for other alts. They're simple a necessity to run a blockchain.
Though for Ether it makes the IPO tricky. The team labels it basically as donation - while obviously many investors speculate on the value of the coins. Since they're merely spam-protections for the scripts to run, there is no high drive for them to get valuable.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:43:11




If you don't like what they offer, then you can't just state it as fact that they don't offer anything to anyone. That's either arrogance (that your opinion is the sole truth or only your needs matter) or it's trolling.

I really wonder how effective it is though. This coin has now been sitting for a good while on top of Coinmarketcap - and I noticed zero threads on It seems to be always the same: Before a scam breaks, only a few speak up and are easily drowned by fanboys or doubts. Afterwards you see the 20 postings pop up here. I think that's not the proper and useful balance.  
If the cryptospace wants to work without government regulation, then it has to evolve proper warning systems - including consequences.  
Neo&amp;Bee and Gox come to mind who were able to pull their scams for months if not years. Since the community can't ban them, then at least they should have had long been delisted from all markets and sites when they didn't adhere to proper norms.  
In my eyes Ripple &amp; Stellar don't either, and it's just a longer-term manipulation that is waiting to implode on people. Complaining afterwards will be of little help.

Adding a question here: When they would put in "buy back if it rises to 400", are those shorters guaranteed to get it at that price? I can imagine that when a squeeze would happen, the supply could just vanish - and they'll have to buy at 1000.   
(those are just example numbers ^:) )
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:28:55
Thanks! Couldn't that make Bitfinex a fractional reserve? If people put in $400 in the system to buy back, but then the price rises too fast, they could just say "screw it" and leave the platform.  
If the price rises 100% it's clearly smarter to not pay up. Below that users might have just gambled, and don't have any additional funds.

Did you look even look at the top PoS coins? There is tons of stuff going on. The NXT Asset Exchange for example is thriving, 3rd party apps using the chain are sprouting up - and a coin creation system is released in a week. Clearly they're building an economy. Just as with bitcoin that gains value because it offers functionality.
Also absurd to say "there is no motivation to either hold or trade PoS coins" ... while your exact critique was that people hold and trade.


What mechanic? There is no interest in many PoS coins.  
They are released - and initial holders have more. Just like in Bitcoin for the majority of coins now. And for stocks like MS. Nobody complains about Bill Gates having initial stock - then holding and selling when the price is high.
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:56:22


You're either lying or you're willfully ignorant. Again: If you don't like whats offered (faster transactions, colored tokens, coin-issuing-systems, encrypted blockchain-messaging, less blockchain bloat, distributed exchanges, alternative DNS, decentralized file storage, pegged assets, server-less decentralized marketplaces) - then that's fine. If you conclude that only what you like matters, then you're arrogant.




You must be joking - what is this nonsense? After 2 minutes I already found 3 false claims. Just because it's a pdf it doesn't make it any smarter than a blog. If it pretends to be a "paper", then it should provide at least some basic references.
(I'll refer you again to Buterin's blog if you want to read from someone who knows what he's talking about)




1: Yes they _will_ use Bitcoin - which is a speculative token.   
2: In fact, they don't exist yet - and we don't know if they will work out - so again you're demanding that everyone sits still and waits until this one experiment maybe works out?    
3: Considering that - we have yet to see if they won't even have different values to Bitcoin. Depending on the locking mechanism, and the services the chains offer, that might be possible. If it's possible it will happen..

Stop trolling me please.




Well, then that would settle the discussion - it's exactly my point.




By using an additional block-chain.




I'm talking about creating new different currencies on top of another.




That makes no sense. They are perfect examples of what distributed unalterable records are for. Even 5 seconds of thinking would make that clear: the difference to "transactions" is trivial.
That Bitcoin didn't manage to provide any of this after 5 years is the best proof that the outside innovation is necessary.   
Btw: I forgot to list one extremely promising innovation with smart contracts.




1 - Blackcoin doesn't use the PPC mechnaism of centralized time-stamps
2 - NXT is not close source since a looong time (if the writer would at least try to cite refrences, he would have found out in 1 google search)
3 - These currencies and others do achieve distributed consensus
4 - The stake grinding (usually called nothing-at-stake) has been researched by proper math PhDs - including actual math and simulations. They found that existing PoS algo's are resistant: 
And just adding 5 - more as a obvious logical problem: That there was an attack on NXT once a year ago doesn't proof that it doesn't work. By that same logic Bitcoin doesn't work, because it was successfully attacked in its early years.


Funny, in your last sentence before you're accusing me of "just making an unfalsifiable claim".  
At least Buterin states facts, sources and math - and doesn't just ramble personal opinions like in the PDF you sent me.


See above.


 
So in response to me explaining why that PDF is wrong, and badly researched you give me a page with links to that same PDF (and more by the same writer) and say "read this"? Thanks.

For trading between cryptocurrencies, there is the distributed exchange [Multigateway]( With this, there is no single point of failure. 
At the moment it's three independent companies that have servers which all have to agree on the withdrawals/deposits. It uses the NXT Asset Exchange then for the trading between currencies - so that part is fully decentralized.
Again, it's nothing to store your life savings in. And it's still pretty early (just moved out of Beta I believe). But it's the move in the right direction - already better than trusting one owner/company. ~~Once NXT gets multisig~~* the amount of servers can go up - so something like 90 of 100 agree or so.
I hope more services like that sprout up. Just fiat exchanging I imagine will never be decentralized.
**Edit:** I was told it's actually BTC that needs to allow multisig above 3 addresses - then it is possible. Though a reply below suggests even more ways this will move to full decentralization.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:38:15
I'm just learning this now too - since there is this other mining operation collapsing: LtcGear. People have still hopes to get their money back - but it's slowly getting ridicules with zero information and daily delays for a month now.  
Nevermind, but the part I really noticed is how huuuuge this community is. Several threads about this on a forum fill up at 10 pages a day or so. Mining is massive - and it promised some astounding amounts of returns. It does seem insulated though - I never noticed this big community before.
The thing I wonder is how they could support a coin price. Litecoin seems to only rely on miners, as I see no other use case. But miners would sell all the time, no?
The other amazing part is the price floor. There seems to be something specific about this group of people that they think this is realistic - to buy low, with the guarantee that the other guy buys higher, essentially gifting you his money. That makes zero sense in my book.

Either way, if you say there is an option preventing the pooling problem then I can accept that (even if I just don't fully grasp it).
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:00:13


I can't make sense of that. If the costs are lower, there is less pressure to sell. And why are they "back" when they're new?


Also don't quite see it. What exactly is the good part about driving the price down. All these manipulation theories seem to always ignore that most businesses (especially miners) would profit much more if they could manipulate the price upwards.

This blog entry by Vitalik Buterin should be interesting to you: 
I read it as blistering take-down against Counterparty and Sidechains (veiled in tech jargon). Then again, I'm strongly biased - their approaches never made much sense to me. Counterparty takes disadvantages of Bitcoin, sprinkles on their own coin - which for proper usability you have to get anyways. I call it a PR stunt - Vitalik used "slight cognitive network effect".
With Sidechains I still have problems to grasp it fully - but the more I read the stranger it sounds. You have to trust that the chain will get properly mined anyways so that you can get your coins back. It all just gets complicated to use - and adds security issues to Bitcoin.
Why not straight up like Ethereum? Exchange to it, and use a coin perfectly customized for it's purpose. While using Bitcoin for what Bitcoin is made. At some point exchanging between such currencies will be seamless or even invisible to users anyways. Compare it to the internet: users don't need to care anymore if they're using an email protocol or html or whatnot. They have one browser window.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:12:35
Yeah, I think actual fiat will just never be possible - because you need banks in between somewhere. Pegged assets would be an option to allow speculation at least... but I'm skeptical that those will work long term. Governments tried those before and always failed.

@_date: 2017-02-18 11:12:57
The biggest issue in Bitcoin is the mining. The worlds ecosystems are on the verge of collapse, and we want to just burn more stuff so that we can transfer money? It seems crazy. It's already huge amounts and will get exponentially worse if the adoption rises.  
Additionally mining is also scarily centralized. Two pools colluding already being a risk - it looks like an ignored elephant standing in the room. For all I see, how the dynamics are set up, it will just get worse. And recently I've learned that mining hardware production is even more so - you don't play nice to the hardware makers and adopt their opinions, then they'll just not give you access to become a miner.  
And then we have the blockchain growth issue... on which the politics around the development (including soap-opera-style personal attacks here in this sub) seem to crush any hope that the bigger issues can be approached.
Right now I'm still mostly betting on Bitcoin though - I have hope left. The issue Bitcoin tackles is just too important.   
But I don't like how the article words it all in with "us" and "ours" vs. "them" and "theirs". Cryptos can and should work together. There are black sheep on both sides, but also idealists who all dream to make finance decentralized.
I see no problem with several currencies existing at the same time anyways. It works fine right now - switching is already easy and possible in decentralized ways. That will just get easier over time, to the point where you might not even know that you switched currency for another use-case.   
And since the article also does some price speculation: The overwhelming dominance of Bitcoin means even small spill-overs will be a huge boost for the alts. They are the breeding ground for innovation - that will give chances for big rises... and in turn, the gained insights help Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:47:39

You're switching topics again. The fact stands - POS suffers not or less from inflation.

Vitalik said though, that Ether can be well implemented as sidechain. 
Even though I always think dreams can be sold so much easier than the real thing (why trailers are often better than finished movies) - I'm also not sure it's vapor. There are other alts that have SmartContracts already running their test blockchains. Counterparty also said they can copy it. So why not Ether? They have then the PR power on their side to become market leader.

Hard to say for sure - because it's not clear how it will be implemented and picked up. Should the chains be merge-mined, then that should mean miners will prefer pools, raising the 51% attack problem.  
Now if they don't merge-mine, then either they leave the main-chain - weakening Bitcoin. Or ignore the side-chains... making them an easy target (defeating the whole idea).
All of it adds complexity and blockchain-downloads. Which are risks in themselves.

It's incorrect though. For one: Counterparty doesn't need you to buy it's coin, you can trade in Bitcoin.
I would also disagree that you have to "worry" about price fluctuations of Counterparty or NXT. Reddit would be valued as what Reddit is worth - you can just as well calculate that in BTC or $. It's all just math, and you can already buy NXT assets via Bitcoin too anyways.
Proof Of Stake is btw. also not mentioned as possible Altcoin scheme. Which makes a ton more sense than mining - because obviously they would not give the shares to miners but to whoever buys the shares (or does whatever reddit activity they want).

Even better with gold, where you additionally different measuring systems.
Add in the roller-coaster meme for every time Bitcoin jumps a percent up or down, and there is not much actual content left on this sub.

So then it about adds up. 10 years is likely not what he planned for. Add the running costs of the exchange, and it would have been even more. With the half-legality of it (or maybe even illegality), it would have been hard to have this in the books so long. And with dwindling market share it became less likely to work.
At some of the crashes people wanted their BTC. The price made a buyback impossible, and once the crowd picked up on the missing coins, it avalanched and it was quickly game over.

I don't really understand how the quote of Szabo explains the issue away. He just says that it seems strange to an engineer ... but not why that engineer would be wrong.   
I see Proof of Stake as a good alternative. Several cryptos show that it's safe... Ethereum probably will be be a big step to make Bitcoiners look more seriously at it. It would allow people to run full nodes on Rasperry Pis.  
It needs tweaks and maybe alternative ways to go about it - but the core concept is promising.

What if it was a community (majority of miners or stakeholders) decision?
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:37:17


I still don't get what you mean here. You just wrote yourself that the system would have gone broke without a bailout. That would be a 100% loss, which is obviously more than anything that happened on bitcoin.


One thing litecoin did was changing the mining so that it's not as easy to dominate the market. They also did stuff to prevent certain minitransactions to make manipulation harder.
Just as example that it is possible to change the system to make it resiliant.
So what exactly has to be changed to prevent someone from buying in with 20 billion dollar and destroying the markets? I don't know. But I'm quite sure there is a risk.
Just look at Litecoin. I don't know if the common story is true - but they say a whale keeps the price at 24 since nearly a week. 
Even if it isn't directly true - the constant fear of whales shows there is something going on, that can harm confidence.
And for now, as far as I understand: If more people join, the whales will just get bigger. Since their holdings grow in value. No?


Do they have to adhere to these regulations with bitcoin? Or aren't those about stocks and such?


 
Yeah "everyone" is an exaggeration. But even now I hear Max Keiser ranting about silver or whatnot being manipulated by Wall Street. It's definitely often took up as argument to go to bitcoin.
Another one was that it's democratic - well if whales get bigger and own the majority of the currency, then it's not democratic.

Well, it should work when everyone independently works for their self-interest. But just as with bitcoin mining: If someone has 51% of the pool, then this doesn't work anymore.  
So if only 9% of all Ether are staking, then the person with 5% can double-spend.  
At least that is how things are standing now. There are proposed solutions ('transparent forging') that would get the needed stake up to 91%. But it's theory at the moment.

You're countering your own point. If you don't need on-chain transactions, you don't need to care about miners.

Well, maybe ... but it makes transacting bitcoins a shit experience.  
You put in a normal fee, and your transaction stays stuck because segwit is blocked by antpool. Since the pool gets bigger, the fees rise... and your transactions stays stuck. Add in some other random factors - and it might be stuck for days (had this happen). And if you're really unlucky the fees are permanently high and the pool stays big, and your transaction is stuck forever (you might be able to replace-by-fee, but only if you have the right wallet for it).
This isn't an average-Joe compatible process. I pray that LN fixes this - and gets some adoption by exchanges/merchants.

But if I understand the article right, then he says that courts don't accept statements like "the code is the contract" (he mocks that idea). They care for what was intended by both parties. So the DAO would have had to provide due diligence. And stepping forward would be risky for the thief. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 11:00:06

That doesn't make much sense. At the core: Why should OTC sellers be willing to give away their coins for cheap? They don't have unlimited supply, so they would want to make most of it.
And why should the market be manipulated down only? The OTC traders would have tons of money after some trades, and surely would rather manipulate the market upwards - and they would have a much easier time doing so, given that they would want to buy anyways. Any outsider that wants to get in, wouldn't have the BTC to manipulate down (their goal would be to get more in the first place).
But in the end: If someone is buying outside of exchanges... that also means someone was willing to sell and that's neither on exchanges. Maybe the 1% are desperate to get in, but then miners are desperate to sell. It would equal out. Else, if one side is not under pressure, they could just stall trading, and make the other side use exchanges (pushing the price in the direction favorable to them).
Also I dislike this constant "as I predicted"... even from the article it seems clear that there were just tons of predictions, and some of them turned out right, while others were far off.

Andreas Antonopoulos explains it well. Small and corrupt countries like Venezuela have trouble enforcing bans - nobody cares about laws in the first place. The US could do it, but since the Government acts more lawful, they won't ban so quickly.  
We'll see how it goes. I'm sure they'll try at some point. If they manage, then it will be huge hurdle for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:13:36
Their systems for transactions are extremely complicated, archaic and insecure. Because how do you make sure someone at some bank doesn't just create money? So internal blockchains would simplify the whole thing. Though I'm sure they're not very interested in Bitcoin itself, for the reasons you mention. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 12:50:43
I don't understand how one of his core reasons is that the dollar will get stronger... while exports to the US will slow down. These seem to me at odds against another. A stronger dollar means they'll import more as it's cheaper.  
And I'm not convinced that tariffs will do a lot in the short to mid term. As we've seen with Britain: A country can't just switch back to be a production powerhouse quickly.

Certainly if you add up the remaining holdings of him and all his employees and inner circle and of the actual company, then they still have a huge percentage of the market.

Quoting you here: "if Bitcoin was doing 2% of the global transaction volume, why would you mine Bitcoin instead of the (far more profitable) competition? Where would Bitcoin's security come from then?"
So you connected mining to the topic. If Ethereum is POS, then obviously no miners can switch, making your question nonsensical.
 






How is that an answer? I described the current state of affairs. The tech Buterin suggested to fix the issue (he clearly recognizes) is wishful thinking at this point.


Whole other discussion. But for one, Satoshi didn't talk about POS - I would think that full nodes are important in that system.

I dunno - I'm surprised how many people were willing to put huge sums into this currency and even more this DAO. At the beginning it was even just promises.

It's a question of how fast though. If the blockchain grows much quicker than the storage, then there's a problem. AFAIK all cryptocurrencies have this problem - the alts much more so than Bitcoin. Currencies like Ether cannot work at scale with their current tech. Not sure about Monero.

Was thinking the same when reading the $1000 threads on the other subs: Everyone tells their sob stories about how they failed to buy last time. But no one said "but I'm going in now".  
There is no way $1k is the endpoint. Bitcoin will either crash and die, or $1k will become another funny anecdote about how insanely low the price used to be.
@_date: 2016-06-18 10:37:40


Actually no. [Here is a fantastic write up on this in the light of the DAO](   ).
In short: You can't just put anything you like into a contract. Courts generally side with what could reasonably expected from an investment.
Which puts the DAO is in a especially tough space. They specifically said: *"The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code [...]. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO’s code."*  
So now they either break that promise with a rollback - and have to admit that in fact reasonable expectation is what matters.  
Or they don't roll back and broke the reasonable expectation of due diligence. So users might actually be able to sue them.
So I'm not 100% sure, but I think a stop of withdrawals on exchanges is OK. A rollback is a step too far though - because as you say the hacker just did what the code allowed. And that's what the whole Ether promise is based upon.
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:52:47

If LN works, then 3 tps might be enough for quite a while. Most day to day transactions should be totally fine on LN even if some trust is temporarily involved.   
Two things to remember here: The block limit will certainly be raised at some point if the hardware has caught up. And secondly, bitcoin was never able to scale for everyone to buy coffee... not even with 50 MB blocks or whatever. So second layers were always gonna happen.

In 2016, Ethereum was a much better investment.  
2013 was probably NXT. Or Litecoin (which outperformed BTC a lot).
Which means they (and most certainly other alts) were worse in 2014.
And Andreas A. said the other day that the Argentine Peso was worse also.

Yes, that sounds little. But if you have that growth rate, then you'll have the whole bitcoin supply within the month. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:23:51
Until they figured out the situation, they had to stop the possibility of the hacker cashing out. So while I see the big problem with this path - there is also a good moral reason for it. And a practical one: We (meaning all of us in the crypto space) have to start punishing the hackers. They get away with far too much. In all big hacking cases I can remember - even the half a billion one on Mt.GOX - we don't even know who was behind it. That's unsustainable.
While I'm at it: I find it very disappointing that frontpage is filled with Ethereum bashing now, while any positive alt-news were always instantly deleted or down-voted.

It will destroy their ability to create lots of money out of thin air. There is no doubt in my mind that at some point they will realize that, and come down hard (Andreas Antonopoulos said so also). We can only hope we're far ahead by then.

Seems shitty advice though. You would have to take serious security measures for Coinbase also. And as people typically do, they'll just get lazy and leave the coins on the exchange forever.

Do you have links about that? I think governments would prefer a bit inflation right now, so why would they fudge the numbers?
@_date: 2017-01-26 00:12:48


Possibly. The law states that you're not allowed to withdraw certain amounts of money, because it looks suspicious. That's what they got Dennis Hastert for. He used it as hush money - but that itself isn't illegal. Him using cash was.  
Again: My point is that he wanted privacy, but that was not OK. The government had no further burden of proof.


One case doesn't dismiss my point. The law is different per different state.  
And even then, it seems the article says the direct opposite of what you claim. Quote: "The laws are made now such that anybody that has cash seized from 'em, the burden of proof shifts over to the person whose money is seized to prove that it's legitimate money."
In one case they describe, all the evidence the cops provided was "it smelled like weed".

@_date: 2017-08-27 10:21:48
Correct - that's why I didn't put it as top priority. But it's a barrier if you aim for as many nodes as possible. Some want to have 8MB blocks or remove the limit altogether, and then it would be a real issue.
Incidentally, it's one of the Achilles heels of Monero and Ethereum, should they keep up rising transactions volumes. There is no blockchain solution for "buying your coffee" yet, and we'll have yet to see how well LN will work. So maybe there isn't one.

Depends on how the crisis unfolds. If it's a fiat currency crisis, then wealth I'll definitely flee to bitcoin.  
In last crisis, fiat was surprisingly stable considering that they started printing like mad. But who knows what will happen next time. Once the stone gets rolling downhill, it'll become an avalanche especially because of bitcoin. And the gov will try to stop that.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:08:26
And that leads to problems - as they already had some weeks ago. They can raise the gas limit, but that essentially equals Bitcoin raising the block-size. You're trading off transaction-count with centralization. An additional issue is that Ether can't just wait and postpone a solution. Since their transaction stack is linear, having a waiting list for transactions will break applications (e.g. exchanges).

You make sensible points. But I still think that comparing the aggregate value of two entities is the best way to go about it. It takes all the minor points and kinda averages then out.
If you would look at details like transaction value it would actually get more confusing. I bet bitcoin has much higher aggregate transactions, despite having a much lower number of transactions. Because you could move a couple of millions easily, but would rather avoid lots'a small transactions.   
And we have little indication what are actual transactions between people in bitcoin, since you can just move them between your own wallets. And so on...

* Greenadress: not in full control (you'll have lost your BCash for example)
* Coinbase: not in control.
* Blockchain.info: had security issues over time
* Mycelium: bad user experience... and (when I tested) lack of security features.
* Copay/Bitpay: Will split to Segwit2x-coin

I once went through all Bitcoin predictions on tradingview - took me ages. I would have expected a good percentage of them being right just by chance. Turned out: Nearly all were massively wrong. Probably because the predictions are mostly too specific ("goes up first, then down 50% a month later" or so), which leaves too many possibilities for it to go another way.  
There were one or two correct... but the same person always made more predictions then that all turned out false.

And we don't even know yet if mining will work sustainably in a long timeframe. The blockchain concept will stay. But it would be unusual if it's first implementation was the final one.

Why? Clearly demand didn't change. It's the supply that 'disappeared'. 
Your idea makes no sense anyways. There are only two forms of lost coins: The ones where we know for sure they were burned or such. Those would be already priced in by definition - since "we know for sure".  
The other ones would be "coins possibly or likely lost". But those we can't remove for sure. And they are also partly priced in anyways: If Satoshi's coins (considered lost, since Satoshi is not expected to sell) would start to move, then the price would crash massively.

Not sure I get what you're saying. Since Ethereum is becoming POS, mining will not matter to it anyways.   
Also, unless "sharding" (I think that what it was called) is implemented, Ethereum is not scalable at all. The blockchain will just get massively huge and grow many times faster than Bitcoin's. As of yet, I assume it's just a name with a big promise - I have not seen any specification of how it will achieve that.  
I see reasons for Ethereum to exist - but it is not as store of value like Bitcoin.
Also not really agreeing on Counterparty. It in essence used it's own coin anyways. It was never purely bitcoin.

That scenario is not so directly comparable to now. If Bitcoin reached that high value, then it has proven itself much more than now - so why would anyone move back fully?

And yet, there was no significant wave from Greece into Bitcoin. They even had a much easier opportunity than the poor countries in crisis right now, like Venezuela.

I don't get the idea that the network weakens because of the price. People that run nodes don't do so because of the price. And the hashrate fluctuation doesn't weaken Bitcoin unless it's super sudden.
I'm also very skeptical about this "price manipulation" talk. Somehow it always comes up when the price is down... and the idea is that Wall St. and Co want to "buy cheap". But while it makes sense that they think long term... they're still competing with each other. And if one is in, then it would make much more sense to manipulate upwards. To make profit and make it harder for the competition to join.
It's nice that Wall St., the banks, the media and the governments are much more supportive to crypto than I would have ever expected. But they all clearly still don't understand what Bitcoin is... they don't know what's coming.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:21:20
Here is mine: The hedge fund news of yesterday. That a first fund moves in, is a huge confirmation for the idea behind Bitcoin. And now the greed will kick in: This small fund will want more, since it apparently already paid of so well. And the others don't want to fall behind or miss out. Not gonna need to explain that even a fraction of their worth moving in would be absolutely crazy.
Add in that we got confirmation that the Trump administration will be friendly to Bitcoin, and we have the stuff for a minor jump. Which in turn will cause media attention.  
So I'm pretty hopeful for the coming months.

And while you're right to point out that ETF's can short, I doubt that the people that didn't care so far about bitcoin will now start learning and then short it to zero. It doesn't add up.

I hear this talking point from prominent economists too - but to me it sounds nonsensical. It doesn't assign any value you could measure, nor would it prevent inflation to make your dollar to inflate close to zero. 
And it's already moot, as you can pay your taxes and such with bitcoin in some states. It's now bitcoin suddenly inherently worthy?
Same with the "gold is useful for deco or industry". Gold would have 0.1% of the value of that's all there is. And it's probably liked for jewelry precisely because it's precious.  
Gold is rare, practical and can't be produced by other means than mining. That's why it has it's value ... that works since thousands of years.


It would be huge markets if they would switch, and it would add up. Next in line is Turkey and maybe Iran. And it would be a reinforcing cycle. The more countries use it, the more sense it makes for others to switch (like with the dollar currently).

Hydro is not especially green. They also release a lot of greenhouse gases.


I find this whole discussion greenwashing. If Bitcoin uses renewable energy, it still means it could have been used for other purposes. Like for example we might soon have to start sequestering carbon. That takes energy - and could be a great candidate for using up over-capacity of renewables. Well, now it would have to compete with Bitcoin mines. 
It might be all worth it if Bitcoin actually replaces the rotten financial system that destroys the world. But for all I understand, the biggest problem the mining solved was the distribution. The mining reward will run out anyways. Then it's only fees that pay miners, and at the current pace in the coming decades, these will not be enough to sustain the current mining model. Proof of Stake is much more green - and is now working securely in the wild for five years.  
So why not use the knowhow of the Bitcoin devs to take a good look at PoS - and if possible apply it to Bitcoin? And changes are inevitable anyways. We should get ahead of the issue and not wait until Bitcoin's sustainability becomes a huge issue (also inevitably).

Good point.


I'm not sure it helps you to locally run the randomizer. The problem is that the blockchain needs to choose you as next block creator - so you need to be in control of the chain already.
Other chains handle that differently.


Yes. It would bolster my case if PoS had been around even longer. Though it had some checkpoints in its system, making it not purely PoS at the time.

1) Nothing-at-Stake is IMO a buzzword. The [hurdles are so high]( - that basically 50% of the currency owners have to attack the coin they own. 
We also have a 5 year track record of no one being able to pull this off. 
2) I don't know what you mean with more incentive to collude... I think there is less as compared to miners. Miners don't necessarily have Bitcoin at risk when doing a 51% attack. In PoS, attackers would attack themselves.
3) The distribution in Bitcoin has already happened in our scenario. So for BTC it wouldn't be an issue.
There might be more risks. But so far no one has really looked into this for Bitcoin. Ethereum might be able to switch to it, as they plan - so that should give further assurance of it's safety. 
Either way - the energy waste problem won't go away. It will get worse, in that Bitcoin will need more energy and that it'll get harder and harder to justify it as the climate heats up. 


PoS was invented after PoW. And I think PoW was necessary for distribution (as you mention). But that one is 90% done.

There are a good bit of of problems with it though. For one - you're basically surveilled for all your purchases. Additionally, there are fees.

Yeah, I agree - it's just another downside to BCash, and it would just create a lot of headaches in the future if it would take over. Surely they now also have a huge chunk of the coins itself - making it more centralized for mining **and** distribution.
I sure enjoy to have some price gains, but I would prefer it slower and more steady - and that the newcomers have time to adjust, learn and not panic.

Exactly! The more cryptos with value we have, the better. It makes the whole space anti-fragile.
I'm in alts, and personally think bitcoin is in technical trouble it'll have a hard time to get out of (the mining much more than the fees). But I want bitcoin to succeed alongside the others.  
That's what makes BCH different - they tried to attack and destroy bitcoin. Harm the users, manipulate the discussion and steal the name. The community should make clear that such behavior is unacceptable in crypto.

Again though, if you just have a personal feeling about it, don't state it as truth. You pretty clearly have no evidence.   
And trusting Ross's words on this is laughable. The has lied a lot. If you believe him, the he isn't even DPR.
Beside that I would take anything he said very skeptically, it doesn't matter much what he believed, or if I agree. But what he did was against the law. He broke it. He profited from breaking it. There's zero question that it fits the definition "criminal".   
By your logic it's a stretch to call a murderer a criminal, as long as the murderer thought killing people is fine.

That seems like an awfully hard comparison to make. How many people take part in this? And how much oil is burned per person? And how much utility do they get out of this?
 
Every 10 minutes the [Bitcoin blockchain burns through 250 barrels of oil]( Yep, full barrels, with 160 liters per barrel that makes 40.000 liters per block. A block has around 2000 transactions. So per transaction 20 liters of oil get burned ... that's literally one user transacting to one other user.  
So does a baseball game burn 20 liters per two persons watching? That's probably not remotely needed even for the people in the stadium. Let alone for running a TV set for two hours - for that[ it's roughly 0.025 liters](
Seems to me that Bitcoin is way way way more wasteful per participant than Baseball. And I don't think it's sustainable with the current tech. If the price goes 10 times up, the mining will likely too - it's just insane to burn that much. Especially considering that Proof of Stake works securely so far without any of that.

I dunno if it's centrally coordinated, but here's definitely something going on. So many accounts (often just weeks or days old) arguing for BCH out of nowhere. Maybe just brigading.
And prices don't move for no reason - least of all with this magnitude. Someone is buying. If it's manipulation, then there's a good chance it'll backfire and cost more than it brings.  
That needs bitcoiners to stay calm. A lot of noobs will get burned in the process.

Obviously I used liters of oil as measurement - I didn't say that directly oil is burned.
 


Some proof would be necessary for your claim, as I don't think that adds up. The cost of energy will always tend to roughly equal the block reward (minus cost for mining gear). If energy comes at zero cost, then that would just mean more energy would be bought for the remaining money. 


We will see. Right now more and more fossil fuels are burned every year. So if Bitcoin uses the solar part of it, then that just means everyone else has to use more of the fossil fuels.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:32:12
They might want to (and gold bugs say this since 30 years), but in reality the opposite is happening. Russia's and China's currencies lost traction in international transfers, and the Dollar keeps expanding its dominance. Only the Euro is maybe a contender.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:37:29
Ether's flippening would have been an annoyance to bitcoin maximalists, but Bitcoin would have stayed around the top coins and even maybe come back.   
The BCH flippening was meant to destroy one coin. Bitcoin would now be a fraction worth, and slowly drop away like BCH will.   
And the user confidence would be severely harmed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:51:16
Which would mean they would help raise the price now.  
Sure, by now we know that there isn't a level they won't stoop to if necessary - but this seems like a risky tactic. If they dump on the falling price, they lose money.  
And should enough miners stay on Bitcoin, then their tactic fails and all they get is less income. 
They could short Bitcoin though... I wonder if that could be something to observe. Are there sudden spikes in shorts before these attacks?
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:33:47
But enforceability is part of it. You want to be able to stop profiting from it. But if you allow the defense of 'maybe I got it for free', then it its next to impossible to stop demand.
Not that I consider 'well the child was harmed anyways already, might as well enjoy the result now' an awfully convincing point to make.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:28:22
Well, they generally don't have a good consensus on what they want. I've read often enough that they think LN is vaporware. Then I had discussions with some that say LN can just work on ~~BitcoinGold~~ BitcoinCash, no problem - it'll come. And some, as you say, don't want it.
But none of it does matter - their core argument is that they can handle the coffee transactions, and Bitcoin can't. If LN works then that is out of the window.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:53:05
Their difficulty is also jumping around like mad - it's one of the reasons why miners suddenly switched to BCH causing massive amounts of blocks, and typically they leave two days later, leading to a stall. That's not a system a business wants to rely on.  
Now they wanna do a hardfork to fix the issue... good luck. But I don't think it inspires confidence in anyone.

LN might take a while I suppose. Not sure how much room Segwit will give, since the growth of Bitcoin use is still exponential. 
Two questions (risky, I know, but I hope a rational discussion is possible):  
- I saw some research that faster blocks could be better for the network. So might it be smarter to do 5 minute blocks instead of 2MB?   
- I assume there will be a time when the mempool will just stay full - with hundreds of thousands of transactions. Are there serious downsides to this (apart of mere inconvenience for users).

That's the argument they are going for in their sub, but I don't buy it. 
I mean, this is really the simplest smart contract one can imagine. Multisig could be explained in one line of dummy-code. And yet even one of the creators of Ethereum can't manage to make it bug free. And that after they had a big breach already - so they must have went over the code a hundred times.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the problem might be worse if you used exchange addresses. So you would have to pay the fee for each one. Depending on how you used bitcoin, you might have to transact ten or more of them for one payment.
As of now though, it's still pretty cheap compared to other services. PayPal and such take percentages, so they quickly get pricier with big purchases. And fees for remittances are just atrocious.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:32:48
Sometimes I wonder how helpful it is to complain about an issue that has no solution.  
There is no blockchain out there at this moment that is decentralized and could handle the demand of bitcoin. And it's utterly hopeless if you want daily transactions for the whole world. ... And ~~everyone~~ everyone rational, including the devs, are painfully aware of it by now.
We should talk in solutions. I personally have no problem with centralized sub layers. Why should visa not allow to top up your card with BTC? Or just use banks with a grocery account. My actual savings would still be save from inflation and a banking crisis.

The one-sided censorship was a key mistake that exasperated the situation. I don't know how to solve it, but too much of the bitcoin information centers are in to few hand of control. Not only are the two biggest community hubs in a single hand, but also the news pages are owned by a few actors with a clear agenda (which often means promoting certain alts).

That's the part I'm doubting. If BCH falls, they'll have to get out - else they'll lose a lot of doe. Surely they have funds to manipulate markets a bit - but it's a cost, and not 100% control.

Great reply - and I agree with your point. In a way I just wanted to highlight how tricky it is to simply compare it to such a thing like a Baseball game.  
Bitcoin also had the specific issue of distribution. Which wasn't possible back then to solve with POS. On the other hand: then environmental impact is an issue, and that's where simply saying "well it was useful" or comparing it to a volcano doesn't work.

I personally consider none of the current top coins a good investment with the exception of Bitcoin.

Pick the right smaller coins on their way up, and it's much easier to multiply an investment.

Because only Bitcoin really has to deal with so many transactions. Especially the direct clones like Litecoin would have the same technical problem - but just no one uses them anyways.   
BCash simply decided to not care about block size - so it'll have less full nodes, until at some point only banks can afford to run one. Of course, even then it'll not reach Visa-numbers of transactions anyways. It's all just a sham.
Ethereum is similar in that it just ignores block size. Only it's worse, because the underlying system necessarily needs many more transactions and much bigger ones. That's why they promise to create other solutions like sharding and Plasma. Those are years off though. Blockchain size issues will come to hurt it - it's only a question of time.  
Monero sits in a even worse spot - their transactions are 100 times the size of Bitcoin. And no scaling solution in sight.
Now there are some currencies that address the issue: Iota works completely different. Supposedly without fees at all - and no blockchain in the first place. It's not running yet though - so we'll have to see. Lisk suggests to use sub-chains. There are not much details known - again, unclear if and when it'll be done. Ardor is similar - it uses "child-chains". These are apart from the main-chain so there is no bloat. The Beta-network runs now - it works with hiccups. Full launch is in January.

It just seems like an insane system. I know that this is how it works, but I still don't get how it makes sense... It's just a crazy loop of more and more money coming out of nothing.
For one, I don't get why banks should ever care about the quality of credit they hand out. It's mostly free money for them anyways. And they would want to create that as much as possible.
And I wonder how solid the system is that keeps track of all this. Who is to say that some bank or institution isn't just inventing money on their servers? It's just numbers.

Just to be a bit contrarian: So creating works of art and valuable information is now worth less. Since it can be copied without limitations.
Money - mere numbers - now become worth even more. And all I have to do is have a lot - then (in the case of blockchain money) it will just become more valuable. Nobody can take it away, neither by taxation or inflation.

Sure, but if they sell once the market is going down, they get less than they would have before. Mining (as far as I understand) doesn't have a huge profit margin - so they would potentially operate at a loss.


I fear though that they have deep pockets. Bitcoin is rising faster than Ver can waste his money on useless manipulation efforts. So this will just keep going.  
And we're not talking enough about the possibility of shorting. They might fill their coffers more each time they can make people panic. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:49:46


What makes it weird is taking annual costs and compare them to daily use.
Your whole write-up falls apart anyways, because this is not just about right now - it's about the future. If we reach Visa-like transactions, then the price would have to be magnitudes higher just by necessity. And then mining would match that price. So massive amounts of energy would be burned. Hence: Unsustainable.
I wonder if there are any examples of items other than bitcoin where value is burned just to prove the value of the item. It sounds a bit crazy. It's not quite like a baker that uses energy necessary to produce a bread - it's more like he burns a dollar each hour so people trust the bread is worthy.
It might be worth it to get rid of the corrupt banking system for now. But it's not sustainable. We can't afford to destroy the environment in exchange. Bitcoin has to look into alternatives.

Sure, but I didn't make an absolute claim (as in "artists get nothing"), but a relative one ("artists get less now"). So the trend is in that way - and I don't think it's necessarily good.

I find the pump so irrational ... Even if one would be just opportunistic, and not care about the [deeper underpinnings of Bitcoin]( and rather just about price - BCash is just not a good bet.
- BCash is at the most just a short term fix for the transaction issue. All this stuff about buying coffee or doing groceries wouldn't work there either.
-  [Visa-scale won't happen]( They need the Lightning network for that... which is the part they purposely fight and made harder by denying Segwit. 
- Next we see that their first code change led to a complete disaster in difficulty - I mean, it seemed to help them now to disrupt Bitcoin, but it just means they'll stall themselves soon again. It's unreliable.  
This Monday already the big issue that led to the scare will have mostly gone away.
- Exactly the problem they chastise Bitcoin for now (slow blocks) is the thing that happens repeatedly on BCash.
- To fix that, they plan to hard fork on Sunday (as far as I read, didn't look into it in detail). Again, not really confidence inspiring. 
- They plan to throw out the core programmers - the ones who in a huge part built the whole successful network they got their wealth from in the first place. How does that make any sense?
- Their team is a joke in comparison.
- They literally promote Craig Wright, the criminally convicted scammer as Satoshi Nakamoto. Just out of spite. I mean... how is that not a sure path to doom?   
... and does anyone even think this toxic behavior of their top guys will subside once they've won?
- Even just price-wise: The higher the price, the higher the incentive for Bitcoiners to sell. Once Coinbase finally unlock their client's wallets, it'll be a major dump.
Literally all I could think of as their advantage is the potential of more transactions in the short term ... if people would actually use it.

The replies to him have a point. There are a ton of alts that I don't buy, and not particularity like the idea of. But I love that there is competition and so many ideas - it doesn't bother me, I just stay out of those. This time the one currency deliberately harms the workings, price and identity of the other.    
They try to take over the name/symbol/good image. They hog the domain and put their spin on there. Most likely they finance spam on the blockchain and in the community (of the second we have proof). They fight with strange tricks to take over the miners - thus knowingly disrupt the transactions of the original chain. In the process they quickly inflate the supply of their coin, which they can dump on buyers. They copy the code with a minor "fix" and thus essentially throw the core programmers out. It's not OK - and I'm disappointed that Buterin would even congratulate them on this. How many newcomers will get burned here? Will that help the space?   
And to add insult to injury, their community seriously calls a convicted criminal Satoshi Nakamoto.
This is not another alt. This is not competition on the merits. This is an attack.

Meh, dunno. How is this different than the altcoins so far? Why is Litecoin not such an attack? Or Doge? They all watered down Bitcoin more or less. Why should now the next fork suddenly kill all bitcoin applications over night?   
In fact, the same is true for traditional currencies. Did it kill gold when silver was picked up as valuable good? 
If BCash could have managed a flipping, then maybe we would be talking. The risk is not fully gone. But other than that, the currency will slowly fade - just like Litecoin and Doge do. Maybe faster, since it seems particularly useless.

Yes. There are two problems though. First, chains like ethereum will definitely outpace moore's law. And even in a best case scenario, it'll not allow us Visa-like amounts of transactions. [Andreas Antonopoulos explains it well](
Secondly, hard drive space is probably not the worst issue. It's bandwidth. Imagine sending a 1GB block every 10 seconds around the globe, for the whole network to validate. Even the speed of light becomes an issue - and that isn't fixable.

Free market doesn't mean sabotaging competitors. They didn't just make a chain and let users decide - which I would be 100% fine with. They tried to destroy the mining safety and transactions on Bitcoin. They also try to steal the name. All this is harming the users of the other coin.

I'm starting to think it's to manipulate Litecoin vs. Bitcoin. If they bought a ton of LTC before offering this friendly agreement to support Segwit there, then they're making an absolute killing. Remember that big out-of-the-blue upwards jump LTC made three weeks ago (before the announcement)?  
Now they can just keep torpedoing Bitcoin - maybe make it unusable so that Litecoin overtakes Bitcoin. If not, they can also just start selling Litecoin - even short it - and let Bitcoin get Segwit. Boom, doubled the income. Rinse and repeat. They have the markets in their hands. Probably way more profitable than mining. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:54:22


I don't get it - why would you own and hold coins that you consider junk and shifty money? I think it's the same with Roger Ver: if he thinks BTC is broken, fine, then put up and move out. Let the market know - only that way the market will reach a conclusion.

If you kept 1000 dollar since 10 years ago, they lost about 20% of their value. That's neither an unusual thing to do, nor is that loss negligible.

Sorry for the delayed answer - quite some material to go through for a little reddit reply. But I appreciate your effort, learning a lot here.




Ok, so that means there was a replication at young age, but much smaller than the original study had.


Which to me means that it didn't replicate past age 15. Unless I'm misreading, that's close to what the vox article said.


Right. You can't distinguish it. Then we could only use logic: Is it likely that this inhibition has an effect 20 years later on success? No, and shouldn't be assumed, as the study doesn't prove that unusual claim. The willpower effect has in general been fallen out of favor in studies. It's much more likely that it's a wealth effect.
I don't understand enough about statistics to judge your point that a longer time would have changed all this. Maybe you're right. But since the effect was lower the longer the time was, it seems counter intuitive that the effect would come back again with longer time.
But yeah, you're correct - it wasn't a full "no replication".

The most simple answer - and yet again so blatantly obvious that I think you must be kidding - is Bitcoin. You can buy it with alts.  
You can of course buy stuff in some webshops. And you can buy (with specific alts) into investments or contracts.   
But I dunno even what the question is supposed to prove - it's not as if Bitcoin is used a lot for buying stuff in shops. That's not it's core function.

I am all for less drama and hate the personal attacks. But covert ASICBoost is an attack on the mining consensus.

And therein lies the problem with using these low fees. There can be a slow block, and maybe generally more usage, and boom, you're on the bottom of the pool.  
If you're really lucky, the fees rise more - and your transaction won't get confirmed for weeks. Possibly perpetually stuck. Even main stream wallets don't always support "replace by fee" ... so you can't unstuck it. Maybe with a big effort you can? Anyways, it's not a system that can be reliably used for payments.
Once the pool is full, fees don't rise gradually - they can rise explosively. In a matter of days we could be back at the crazy high fee situation.
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:39:56


id argue that neither is particularly malicious.
Even if I would buy this logic (which I don't), the whole blocking of Segwit and all the toxic threats of splitting the chain came because they secretly wanted to protect ASICBoost. It makes sense for their bottom line - but to call that "not malicious" is absurd.

It didn't replicate the effect - in the shorter time scale it was very much reduced due to controls. In the long scale, the effect completely failed to show.   
You're underestimating the problem with the correlations. If family background is the cause for both the delayed gratification and the later success ... then clearly the original idea of the causation is unproven - and in fact unlikely.


I don't see how your point could apply. They specifically point out that even after 20 seconds the effect goes away. So the remaining minutes (7 or 15) wouldn't make a difference.

Typically altcoins are very small communities that communicate in one location. Hardforks happen relatively often (and softforks all the time), and are not very controversial for several reasons:
- issues are easily discussed beforehand.
- the users trust the developers. 
- forks are often simply necessary for development.
- the values are mostly not *that* high that it makes everyone go crazy.
None of these points apply to Bitcoin, so it would be hard to draw conclusions from what happens at the alts.
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:44:41
I don't get the problem - maybe someone can explain it to me. The users of the nodes still have the decision. It's just that the miners here met up with the devs to make a proposition. It's the same as bitcoin devs getting together making code that nodes then can decide to use or not.  
And what's the alternative? If no subset of a community can come together to draft proposals, then there can't be any governance, only chaos.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:35:41
To be honest - it's a lesson I take from this. The idea that Bitcoin could be this apolitical unicorn - this totally trustless organization where everyone is perfectly selfish and yet everything works out perfectly, just didn't turn out to be true.  
Things are always more complicated - and not all elements can be predicted (i.e. covert algorithms, a mining gear monopoly, irrational actors). 
At the end - politics exist in bitcoin. And the actors should have a minimum of goodwill for the whole - except for only their bottom line. Bad actors have to be policed in some way.  
Indeed, some alts (like Ether) have embraced a more "adjust it if it feels necessary" approach. Although it's yet to be seen how far it can carry them once the sums on the line are as big as in bitcoin.
"Trust minimization" seems a good term for it: math and game theory can do a lot - but it can't do it all.

Most people that care about crypto wouldn't touch it - since it's actually not a decentralized cryptocurrency, but rather a digital currency.

This sounds like an absurd belief. Of course there should be a level playing field - else one party will outcompete all others and you have a centralized system. The antithesis to Bitcoin.   
The word "cheating" is morally loaded, which is unnecessary - we can boil it down to technical aspects. If the properties of the current code lead to centralization, then the code has to be adjusted. No one can expect that it all just works perfectly without changes from day one.

That Bitcoin is not correlated - or possibly counter-correlated to stocks is huge though, if it holds. It would make it the holy grail for hedge funds, who need to seek assets that stabilize their overall portfolio. Even better if it's a safe haven in case of a crisis.

I would be careful with this. I think people misjudge the problem, because the graphs look gradual. The thing is though, that as soon as the limit is hit, everything will go haywire again - and fees will quickly explode. 
I'm fully with the Segwit/LN path, and hope (esp. LN) solves this, but we shouldn't downplay the problem. If another price run-up happens, the transaction count will go up. It's a hard ceiling and no wiggle room.

In fact fiat does have some properties of a slot machine. If you play often and long enough, you **know** that you'll lose money.
Also: taking debt to invest is a normal move most serious investors/institutions do. It's just that you should make sure you're not completely ruined if one or two investments fail.

I see no indicators that that is true. The BCash fork made much more waves and had dedicated support. And we got over it. The disastrous handling of the tech of BCash also weakens trust in the 2X fork.  
Right now there is no full blocks that drive demand to fork. The code of 2X has still not been finalized and vetted from what I see... and no core devs stand behind it. There is no reason to not wait a year or so and test Segwit in the wild, and **then** consider 2MB blocks.
I was scared about the BCash fork. I'm not concerned at all about 2X.

Or go with the simple explanation: Putin and his crooks just figured out that they can wash money with crypto.  
Remember that the guy from BTC-E supposedly did that for $4 billion. That didn't happen without Russian top level involvement. And mining is an even better way to channel money from their natural resources into foreign bank accounts.

I think they're in deep trouble, and can only recommend removing all holdings there (well, if they let you).  
They have now since one and a half months blocked all ARDOR withdrawals. Fixing this should take their tech guy under an hour (they just need to update the wallet). They must be in significant other trouble that they aren't able or willing to do this. At least grips incompetent, as AFAIK it's not the only locked coin there.

Can you be more specific? Because I would say it does address it by stating that no images would fit into OP_Return. It's 80bytes, so it would maybe fit one link. But then the link stores the content, not the blockchain. From your quote it seems like they even mostly talk about links that refer to links that then store (maybe) the illicit data.
Then again... the problem can at least theoretically exist. And even more so on alts like Ether that could easily store enough data for images.

They can't ban physics though.   
It is just physical reality that a bitcoin can be stored in a number of bits that can't be identified as such. In fact, I can store it in my brain... with the actual coins residing on the net. I can even hand you a signed transaction on a piece of paper, that you can then activate somewhere else (I know it's possible with alts, I assume it's with Bitcoin too).

Well, that assumes Germany has that much and just doesn't want it anymore. In that case it shouldn't affect the price since there's a seller for the buyer.

I mean, OP is horribly written - so I don't get it either.
But to call 2X a Trojan horse makes sense. It proclaims just to want more space for transactions - but it is really a takeover by miners and bankers. Less and less ordinary users could run a node - and by design the miners would now define the way forward. If they win this fight, then their power is proven by itself.     
The strongest and most organized opposition they face is from the original core developers. The 2Xers stated the goal to get rid of them openly in a podcast once - but it is by now anyways an obvious. Firstly by moving the repository from their control - and secondly by making them quit (as most of them said they would if 2x would become Bitcoin). 
That they now all along funded a new coin - that then fixes the problem of the many forks... that they themselves initiate all the time... is just the icing on the cake.    
Nevermind that most of these big pocket investors have their hands in Ether all along, and have been using their clout to pump it to great profit already. It's no coincidence that Coinbase supports Ether and that Coindesk pumps it all the time.  
And how I know the irrationality of the crypto traders by now - these bankers will make a killing with their new Metronome coin once again.
It's all a fucking mess. I wish we could just stop this nonsense.    
But too much money is involved. It will only get worse.

A poor young person having no choice in school limits their freedom.  If financial circumstances coerce me into working some job I don't like, then that's limiting my freedom. If I'm sick and I get no treatment, it's limiting my freedom... massively so: If I'm bedridden, I have no freedom of even moving. If I die I have the ultimate limitation of freedom.    
All these libertarians apparently don't care about - they only care about the freedom to not pay taxes.

My tactic has been to select a few and then learn a lot about them. Maybe even just one or two once you have confidence that they are real projects and not scams. You will miss tons and tons of alts that explode in price - but it's just not possible to keep up with all, and I prefer the route of not risking losses.  
Once you're very knowledgeable on a project, you will have an advantage on the market - because most traders have no clue what they are buying.

Economists didn't know before it happened. And likely wouldn't be able to tell now - since it won't be the exact same scheme. The quality of debt is low and falling. It's a time bomb. And there is certainly fraud going on somewhere ... though it's by definition hidden while it's happening.

This is getting seriously silly. Somehow the hackers had access to everything Mark Karpeles ever touched: reddit/blog/business-accounts.

Mark notices none of it - but at the same time lies and cooks up silly cover stories (malleability anyone?). Once someone on Reddit tracks 200k Bitcoin back to Karpeles, he announces that he just recovered them. Phew, that was close.  
The hackers are from the same country... likely from inside his company.
Yes, clearly, it must have been some mystical ninja-masterminds - hiding in Mark's room - that stole from the poor guy who btw. was in Japan because he was hiding of fraud charges in his home country.

If most citizens already live on debt themselves, because wages are to low to survive, then I think raising taxes or inflation **is** an existential threat.  
Interesting discussion. I'm reading a ton about the economy recently (thanks bitcoin for infecting me), but despite searching I have yet to see an explanation what happens on a global debt default.

Yeah, that makes no sense. If I am forced to make decisions because of the threat of starving to death, then that perfectly fits your first sentence. It's that contradiction that I men, that kinda makes the rest fall apart.
Let's add that your "right of property" relies on power and coercion and limiting freedom too. Obviously. Your "based on use" doesn't change it much, except that you need even more government power to judge and enforce those laws.
Even ignoring that: So you wanna create some software so that everyone so can track everyone else, to know what they're doing - to ~~force~~ oh, sorry: persuade them to donate, under threat of social repercussions. That is then the utopian dream of a free society? Again, completely self-contradicting. And highly unrealistic - and not a shred of evidence that it could work. To the contrary.

Let's phrase it different: The government forbids crossing the street on a red light. If I am disobedient, then yes, they can punish me. If they would decide to empty 50 machine guns on me, and then kill my whole family, then - even if I disobeyed the law, and even if they find some legal justification - they're still to blame for my death and it's outrageous that they act like that.
Basically nobody denied that some punishment would have been in order for Aaron. That's why what you talk about, is another topic.
It just grinds my gears how these discussions always go. Someone says something reasonable and measured (in this case talking about "partial blame") - then someone voices an over the top counter, painting things in black and white (which on next to no topic ever makes sense). That person keeps on pretending to care about the topic and about a proper discussion... while in the end it turns out didn't even care enough to read up on basic facts about the story. At then it will all fracture into off-topic discussions about some details... just because no one could ever say "no you were right".

True. Though I think this project does not fit the crowdfunding pattern - namely an idealist cause that VC would never get behind. I might be wrong, but this thing just rings some alarm bells for me.


Maybe we should find a new term here - like Crowd-investing. And keep the Crowd-funding term for things like Kickstarter, where you get nothing except some unchanging reward. I think those are quite different animals. The promise of returns and profit is a much bigger one - and more alluring.   
And just as with Ether I find it questionable.  They apparently sell Factom-coins, but at the same time say from the start that those will not be worth much, and will be under capital control by the business.   
$1 a million times to scam would still be too much.
 


VC firms are able to do proper vetting. The crowd is not.


 
I'm skeptical about this idea of diversification. At least: It has it's limits. The alts are a good example where many people lost a lot of money, because there are too many coins by now, and if you invest in 100, then at least one of them has to give more than 100 times the return. That has not happened to any coin last year I think.
So basically: A VC firm has a higher chance of success, since they can sieve out the obvious scams. If the crowd has for example a ten times higher failure rate when investing, then it might just mean they make a big loss on average.  
 


I don't find that enough of an argument to invest in everything. That's just the lure.


Which doesn't make much sense to me. It's a bait and switch. [Buterin wrote about it pretty nicely]( ... they need their own coin, so at the end it's another alt, and the "based on bitcoin" is just an argument to sell to bitcoin maximalists. 
I say it straight up: This thing has the marks of a scam (and sadly, we've seen a lot of those in crypto to learn the signs). Again I might be wrong. But extra caution should be taken.

When bitcoin was falling from 90% to 40% in a short time, posts about it were forbidden here... because it relates to alts. When it goes from 40% to 45%, we have big celebration threads.  
It's a silly double standard, that will lead to an information imbalance and blindness to facts and important developments. 
Seems to me that this barely breaks the bigger trend. Well have to wait longer to call that. Until then, the more reasonable assumption is that the crypto market will be much more diverse and decentralised... which is a good thing.

That weakens your case. Either it matters, or it doesn't. 2% is a lot - 10 years and you lost about 20% of your wealth. In the 1970s the US had 15% inflation. There is no reason to think it won't come back or possibly go higher. Once it's going, the government can do little but protest about it - we've seen this endless times throughout history.


I think this fact is more esoteric than meaningful. I suppose we have to agree to disagree on this.




10% of production is used, correct? So for 90% of gold there would be no demand. So the price wouldn't just drop to 10% - it would drop much much lower. And that's not even considering that there are possibly millions of tons out there, that then would get dumped.  
At this point, the industrial use plays very little role for the price discovery. If you hoard gold in the thought that it's safe because some industry might use it, then that would be an absolutely terrible investment decision. 


I disagree yet again. If gold would lie on every corner, like pebbles do, then it wouldn't be any status symbol. 




What better options? Most people in Turkey have internet - as far as I know in Venezuela too. But they don't have access to dollars - they pay a major premium for it.   
Turks like gold. But in usability it doesn't hold a candle to BTC. Gold can be faked. It can be easily robbed or confiscated - because you have to essentially store it at your house or take it to the market. You can't easily transfer it - and international use is near impossible. 




You very much overestimate the power of governments. Venezuela and Co. already forbid people to use dollars - and it doesn't stop the desperate from switching. I know governments pretend they have the power - but once inflation sets in, they're helpless. Look at Argentina, Russia, or the Weimar Republic. The people will make their own choice.   
Again, just look at the Dollar: You can use it pretty much everywhere in the world. In most places it will give you a price premium. And why? Because everyone knows it's used everywhere. It's circular. And I don't see why Bitcoin shouldn't get into the same self-reinforcing spiral.

Clearly it is already a barrier now as it is. It takes days to download the chain - not many users will do that. Now you want to 8fold the issue. With that it would also outpace the growth of harddrive capacity - AFAIK it's roughly on par right now.   
The bigger issue anyways is probably bandwidth. Many areas have worse net (possibly sit behind government firewalls) - again limiting the access to maybe only the top industrialized countries. The speed of light is not tweakable. And it gets quite complicated to figure out what happens if nodes cannot sync.   
All these questions need time to get figured out. The idea is not to stay with 1MB blocks forever. But the code of 2x is rushed.

It's all about percentages. $100 investment in crypto would be possible to put at risk for most people living without much in savings. That would have netted nearly $3000 now. If the advice came earlier even $10 would have netted hundreds of thousands now. It's absolutely reasonable to risk $10.

It's just a false equivalency. Sure, you can't do chargebacks - but that means you can easier be defrauded by merchants.

Next to "these coins never existed" this version is the best possible outcome for the Bitcoin price (and conversely the worst if you are a Gox-victim with some hope left).
At least 300.000 BTC, but likely 650.000 BTC, were long absorbed by the market - so are not a threat of being dumped.    
If I get this right, it even means the demand for Bitcoin was much higher than we thought. 650.000 BTC were effectively sold twice - once on Gox and then once back out on other exchanges.

Hard to say what exactly drove the price. It was always a back and forth between China and Gox. I think at least Gox's Willy-bot would not have been able to drive the price that high on it's own. And the bot also sold coins.
  
So overall I think that 650k duplicated Bitcoins would have a much bigger downwards pressure, than the upwards pressure the manipulation created through some timely buys.

Love how they have around 5 slides about how they get money - and no slide about where the money went.   
$5M burned, and as far as I know, actual developers got what... maybe 5%? Where are the other 95%?
The proposed goal of developer funding valid though. If their solution is seen as too centralized, then some better solution has to be found. I see this as a real challenge... maybe the development is the Achilles heel for Bitcoin (or any other coin), since someone has to be willing to do the work and someone has to make decisions.

- People didn't care much in the beginning when Bitcoin was worth next to nothing.
- People lose stuff - like the one famous guy accidentally dumping his harddrive with 7,500 coins in a landfill. 
- One could also accidentally send it to wrong addresses, that no one has access to. Especially possible in the beginning when the tech was less user friendly - e.g. the handling of change addresses (worth reading up on).
- Some people might die and not pass on their holdings.
- There is also dust - which means really small transactions that are hard to transact back.

That doesn't contradict what he said.   
That it was "improperly" seems to be your personal opinion. And is beside the point.


Again, not sure why you repeat what no one contested.




They had him convicted for running a criminal enterprise. Guilty of 7 charges and for at least 30 years behind bars. I'm not a prosecutor... but I can imagine that they didn't feel the need to stretch the case further after all that.


Not sure what any of it has to do with empathy. He stated the facts of the case. You seem to ignore that the hit-man hiring has clear evidence behind it. They have his own writing.   
I wanted to defend this guy too in the beginning - but once you read those details the case is pretty clear, and to claim that he did nothing but "heal the world by selling drugs to the opressed" is ill informed.   
How about empathy for the people he tried to get murdered.

I don't get why the first full implementation of POS is never mentioned (in a "complete guide" nonetheless) - especially since the Ether proposal is inspired by it. NXT runs without any hitch for nearly 5 years (and since 3 months as scalable version as ARDOR).
Additionally there are old tropes that just annoy me. 'The rich get richer' just makes no sense whatsoever... and any mathematician/engineer should see that instantly: you get earnings in percentage of your stake. So unless some other system is used, everyone gets rewards exactly equally. ... 
Similarly with "nothing at stake" ... I guess this one needs more than high school math, but anyways, it is even in theory next to impossible because of high costs and risks, and has not succeeded in the real world (again, there are hundreds of millions for the taking since 5 years).  
 I don't think the attack makes much sense anyways - you would have to trick most of the major stake holders, so that they hand over old keys in a short amount of time. Maybe possible if they're all dumb or don't care to lose.

But isn't all this true then for CounterParty?
And if CP's claim is true, then isn't the crowd funding promise fulfilled as there will be a working smart contract platform? 


What reason is that? And why do other alts, that have comparable block-times not count as evidence? 
And - though I don't know if you argue for CP here - how is their smart contract system supposed to work with 10min block times. That sounds absurd.  
I think it's just another bait and switch, like with their "bitcoin" trading platform, that only properly works with XCP.
Finally, there is also BURST. Which is supposedly running already a smart contract system. I havn't looked into it. But if some small coin can manage, then I don't see why Ether with their $15M funding shouln't be too.

Nobody seems to invest the time to really read up and test the alts they buy. Sort of understandable, since there are 800 of them. But it will cause a lot of hurt in the longer term - I am 100% convinced the alt-bubble will burst within the next months.   
There are great alts with excellent tech out there, that are not on the top of the list already. Pick two or three of those - and stick to them, ignoring the coins that just rise because of speculation. You won't get these 1000% returns in a week, but the upside is huge if you give it time.

It's a bit late in the night to dig for links... but I mean, it's common knowledge that Monero and Co are used on darknets. As such - it's commerce.   
But why is only shopping important? I don't see why speculation and investment is not a valid use for a cryptocurrency. 
Either way, the alts have lots of transactions. Their blocks don't fill up.... because they don't have limits as Bitcoin has. And they just tend to have much more blocks. I.e. NXT has one every minute - and at it's peak had [10.000 transactions per day]( That's not nearly as much as Bitcoin - but NXT is only valued a fraction of Bitcoin (below of how much it was used).
Ethereum has [100k transactions per day]( Did you even bother to google that? How then can you say it's empty? That's half the amount of transactions that Bitcoin has (and again, as per usage it's undervalued).   
Now consider that there are 800 alts, and you get the picture.
So I dunno where you're even going. Why should I care about ATMs? I use bitcoin for buying stuff and never bothered with ATMs - they are obsolete. Though I know that many of the Bitcoin ones support alts (just since I am more informed on NXT - I've seen those, but I'm sure more popular coins are more often supported).
To conclude: Bitcoin is dominant - and rightly so. But Altcoins have great fundamentals also. At least some of them.

Not sure what your point is. If everyone could just get Euro/Dollar, then they would have long done so. But they typically can't - so Bitcoin might become a more viable option. Especially since storage is safer.    
The other thing is that, as with the Ruble, there is only one direction. There will not be a substantial regain of value. Bitcoin though, has that option.

Most alts that use alternative algorithms have much more data to store. It's obvious with Ethereum, which stores whole sets of code and their verification. Their blockchains won't just scale to a bit more size than Bitcoin (which essentially just stores transaction data), but exponentially more. So whatever issue Bitcoin has, the alts will have them much much more.   
Exceptions to this are as of now just in planning or testing stages (Ardor, Ioata, Ethereum's Sharding). Who knows if those will actually solve the issue. The lightning network might solve it for Bitcoin.

I dunno what's going on - but it can't be rational. I think Ether is worth *something*, but not a 3rd of Bitcoin - that's just crazy.    
People seem to get desperate to find more new alts to throw money at. I expected this to bubble to pop for a while, but somehow it just keeps going up. I suspect it'll take some specific event to make it all crash. I sold my gains already, so let's see on how much I lose out on.

If the internet breaks down, with practically all essential government services... if they have no fuel/heating and starve to death... I just kinda think that gold won't be the thing people will worry about either.   
I feel little urge to prepare myself for the total apocalypse. Most of use will be goners in no time. I rather prepare for a long stretched out depression - the much more realistic scenario in comparison.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:28:08
But that's just being stuck to the semantics and fully missing the point. Yeah sure, they're not literally fired... and yeah sure, they can work on whatever they want.
Fact is though: It would completely [ignore the advice of essentially all top contributors to Bitcoin so far.]( It would mean switching to code they don't support - and using the code of another team. And I would not be surprised if many would stop contributing afterwards.   
For all intends and purposes, it's pretty close to a firing. Users and miners have the right of course. The question is if that is really a wise path.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:24:13
The "locking up" was such a blatant attempt at pumping. They were like "we want to make it all trustless for our users". And then you read ... they lock supply up for one month at the time. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I would agree with all of that. The cream of the crypto-crop works in Bitcoin so far. And the alts are necessarily faster moving. Nonetheless they have gathered quite some experience now and have top people in their ranks too. As Andreas said, the more value they gather they more they will be stress tested. I would predict that Ethereum has some tough testing ahead.

Take a little bit of freedom (money) of some who have a lot. And give a lot of freedom (choice of occupation and life fulfillment) to everyone.   
The same would apply to health care, base salary and food for the poor. This would vastly enhance freedom ... but libertarians are exactly against it. In general they prefer having people be forced to work for corporations.  
They are not about freedom.

LTC likely will - since there is not much else to offer. But most of the rest have completely different code bases and don't care about Segwit.   
Though most alts will run into much worse scaling problems. Might take a while for people to notice.

So what, you don't like the label "racist" so instead of changing your racist beliefs you want to change what the term means? You straight-up declared that one ethnic group has genes that give them better intelligence. That is the definition of racism - so just stand by it.  
No science supports your racist claim by the way. Most of what you came up here are old memes, going through supremacist circles since decades. Maybe you should start looking into other corners of the internet.  
That you then want to define "racist" as anyone who doesn't want to believe in a white (and Asian) superior intelligence is just topping it all off with a nice bit of bizarreness.

It's still impressive to experience. The percentages are the same, but in total numbers the amount of money sloshing around right now must be enormous.  
Besides, a strong percentage growth can't be kept up forever. What happened in the last weeks still boggles my mind.
@_date: 2016-05-29 07:52:34
If someone is soo cocky about how many times he was right... that's when I get skeptical. Even if it's true: predictions like this are mostly luck - and luck tends to run out. 
I don't see the governments acting so fast - their bureaucracies typically take decades to react to new developments. Then there is the block limit - which will become a bigger problem with more success. As will general blockchain bloat. And miner centralization.  
There is a lot of room for unpredictable crashes.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:40:55


But not even fast enough for Bitcoin. Hence the fuzz about scaling since years.  
Now consider Ether is 10 times worse at least - meaning it outpaces HD gains. Buterin is well aware - see "sharding".
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:00:21
Because people are suffering?   
I find it rather disgusting that the countries that are to blame to a big degree (the US and Britain) are the ones making the most fuzz and do the *least* to help alleviate the outcome.   
All these fears are overblown anyways. We've seen it dozen of times with each wave of immigrants. Germany was in panic over Italians coming in - now everyone loves their Icecream and Pizza shops. There are problems. And there will be more problems. But at the end Germany will profit, since the population is falling. Young workers are desperately needed - especially in health care.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:04:39
I'm expecting a big drop... but not sure this is it yet. Considering most of them got higher just around 500% in the last half year, then a 20% drop is just a little breather.

Unless there is one party interested in stopping a development, and got powerful enough to do so.
If Bitmain uses ASICboost, then the status quo is good for them and will consolidate their mining power.  
2x would then be a great way to distract and split the community. It's a win for them - either they block Segwit, or manage to get rid of the core devs.

Fully agree here. There are such laws - but they won't bust your door with 7 coppers just to ask you if you know where your money went. Something more nefarious must have been going on here.

Looks like a set of moving averages at different intervals. When the current price is higher than the averages, they turn green (since it's good that the price is moving up faster). When the price is below, the averages turn red (since it's bad that the price is under-performing the averages).

They can do whatever they want - but that doesn't make their bank-coin a crypto currency. It shouldn't be listed on Coinmarketcap - else they should also add Paypal.  
Listing them like a crypto is legitimizing scams. To protect noobs, exchanges should also remove XRP.  
Just my opinion. One day that thing will implode, and the repuation of all cryptos will suffer.
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:31:28
You have to move in to speculate with XRP. Since there is still a flow of new people coming in, the price goes up. But you don't get anything of value (it's not like anyone is saving up XRP for their kids) - you just hope to move in and out at the right moments.   
As such it's a pyramid scheme. It will end at some point and most late comers will be in a world of hurt.

I find it sad and concerning that the financial gangsters seem to right now adopt Bitcoin quicker than the masses do. They have the advantage of funding too.  
If they manage to get their foot in the door, the infrastructure will be held by select private corporations, and they will set the rules. We might lose Bitcoin like we're just giving away the Internet: Seemingly open, but in reality more and more in the hands of a few private giants like facebook and google.
@_date: 2015-03-13 11:44:12
You misunderstand me (I didn't formulate clearly) - but with the ICO I meant Ethereum. They got crowdfunding - and they delivered a smart contract system. Even if that's on Counterparty now, that should be fine, as the goal is reached.   
Find it strange that people call Ether vaporware, if the point here is that it actually works.
Not sure what you mean with "calculate the necessary expenditure of coins". Are you referring to the 10 min block times?  
What I reasoned with that, is that you probably can't just have one block alone do the smart contract. If that's correct, and you need several confirmations, then we can assume roughly an hour for one time running of the code? That would make many of the advertised use-cases absurd. Like the famous "unlock your rental car" example.
Sn811 said that "there is a reason why Bitcoin has a 10-minute block-time" ... by the same token though, there is a reason why Ether aims at a a 10-second one.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:08:12


I didn't say that. I said the lobbying system is corrupt. And I specifically talked about the US.   
Yes, there are shades of gray - but the US is far away from that. If I can give millions to one candidate - even in direct gifts or in donations to his campaigns, and get things in return, then that's corruption. 
Look at the details of McDonnell - he and his family got direct personal gifts in the hundreds of thousands. He frickin waived around the rolex and drove in the ferrari of his sugar daddy. All he got, was a slap on the wrist because he was sloppy on some technicalities. Most what he did was legal.  
So that's what happens on the most open blatant cases...
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:17:24










And that's why you would want Bitcoin or Dollars and not Hyrvnia. Because the Hyrvnia certainly won't go up - neither the Ruble you mention. Those never go up more than an occasional small bounce after major losses. That's why the old people mentioned in the article get it - they know this from experience.   
Same for the Venezuelan Bolivar, the Argentinean Peso....
Also - arbitrary dates (like the new year you picked) don't mean automatically it's representative. It roughly coincided with Bitcoins peak. The more you extend the time-frame, the less noisy the result becomes.


Well yeah. But please read the article, for what it was actually about.

That's why in discussions about these topics I have often the impression people talk more to themselves than to me. Like how 60% of the long posts you write are about how great you work - it feels like you're going through some issues about your work ethic or justifying something to yourself.
Woman are not inherently more lazy or unable. You even agree. But then they all magically turn out to be so ... and it's somehow unfair to ask what leads to the lack of motivation and to remove those factors.

Nor would the police raid your place for the tax office to ask. It just all doesn't add up.

I speculate that it happens in Bitcoin. But it's not speculation that governments acts that way.

It's the same in your bitcoin example. I can clone bitcoin and can use BTC-two as miner fee. Which is exactly how Litecoin (and most alts) work.
is probably correct that it won't matter much (unless you hold XCP). But it's just a factual difference.

So well - this will probably get downvoted to oblivion - but... when you ask for a bitcoin 2.0, that has no mining and where you have "one coin one vote"... aren't you describing Proof of Stake systems? Nxt has a voting system with the next version (others might have it already, dunno). And there is no foundation with any power.
More as comment, I find some of your assumptions strange. Why if the government invented tools, can't others use them better? It's like a hammer: the hammer-inventor doesn't necessarily know or apply all it's uses.   
Secondly - your idea to teach WallStreet that the state is not its friend sounds absurd. WallStreets earnings over the last 50 decades came exclusively from bail-outs. They know very well that they need the state so they can exist.

Bitcoin had its moments when it was overvalued - and corrected then. I am 100% sure most of the alts are overvalued now. Ether is not useless or anything - but there is no way in hell that it has a third of the actual use/value than Bitcoin. And coins like Ripple and Stellar are just bad jokes waiting to blow up. I don't think they can even be called a cryptocurrency.
The question is just how long the irrationality can last - usually it takes longer than one can imagine.

I only know of the stolen Nxt - and Bter took all of the losses and paid back. They raised fees for Nxt for a while.
Bter also helped out before when hackers moved stolen Nxt to their exchange.

By now pretty much all exchanges had been hacked once... I've heard about five hacks the last weekend alone.

There has been an [bter update on weibo]( (edit: says it in short in english on their website too) - which automatic translation turns to: "


We have already made a report on the morning of February 15, 2015 to the local police station and be entertained. We will cooperate with the police investigation to recover stolen coins. Meanwhile, we are here to recover stolen 7170 reward 720BTC coins. In order to ensure the safety of other funds, we have taken technical measures to stop trading and close all virtual currency online wallet, to make further checks. At the same time, we plan to arrange for CNY and extracting other virtual currency, which can reduce worry. We apologize for the damage caused to the user, as of now, bit has been running for almost two years now. With everyone together through the ups and downs of the bitcoin. Accompany you to look at a variety of rise of the currency's decline. Please be assured that we will not run away, we will take responsibility for users to recover the stolen coins."
So If I read it right: 7170 BTC stolen. Police informed. 720BTC reward for helping. Withdrawal of other coins will be enabled soon.
Must say - they're one resilient exchange if the weather this storm too (after the stolen Nxt).

It was a (very well) educated guess, based on leaked data. So not "known" per-se. And lot's of details were/are unkown.

You don't know that - you're again just assuming.  
That's exactly what I propose: Going and asking. If all else is equal (and studies show that woman are equally mentally capable also), then the outcome should be equal. It is not.
I don't even know why a n of 1 study should be awfully helpful here. "Oh it worked for one person, so clearly it will work for everyone"?


See, that's why these discussions hit my nerve a bit. Why do I even have to explain you the most obvious things? It feels like a waste of time. So here we go: Obviously you don't have to "physically assault" some one to harm them.  
You have no clue what social biases affected your personality and strife - because no one has that ability of introspection. How might it have changed your attitude that in general boys are considered more techy? How did it change you that boys have a plethora of praised role models of their own gender in tech? Or that the tech online community is not making bad jokes about your gender all the time?
Either way - the point would stand: The bitcoin community has a problem (lacking 50% of the target group). Woman have a problem (if we take as true that bitcoin will be a major revolution of the coming years).


Still not convinced your stereotypes are very ... ehm ... progressive. Even more so the implications they make: Woman are just weak? Woman are just lazy slobs? Woman only care about fashion?

He seems to be aware of the risks - but acts as if it wouldn't be bad. All his examples end kinda with "well they get their BTS, so all is alright". But that's the whole problem: BTS would be worthless. What do you do then with the "redeemed" BTS you have? Panic-sell? You will get 1 cent for you "dollar". 
Looking at his numbers, it seems more likely than I expected. 67% in a couple of days will happen.

We know some reasons why woman didn't launch the crypto effort: it's because they're not in tech and finance. So already they didn't start in a level playing field. 
Further we know that in both areas there were actual concerted efforts in history to keep woman out - and there are biases that still make it hard for them to join. I do not see why we should accept the outcome and just keep the bad status quo.  
Your arguing is similar to the people saying black people are just lazy, because they earn less. Completely ignoring that a full history created the cicumstances... which take an effort from all sides to resolve.
You make a whole lotta other assumptions - whereas we don't even know why the interest is so low.
Lastly you ignore that we actually might benefit from group B. They might bring different skills, different perspectives - that's one reason why diversity is a bonus not a problem... and obviously they are 50% of the user base. 
Consider your group A having shovels to dig a well, while group B has nothing but a stone bound around their ankles. And consider that removing the stone and handing out shovels might help Group A also to dig a bigger well together. Group A doesn't have to do it - but it's worth the price.

Not sure if it's true about the back and forth between bitcoin and the alts. The [overall trend]( is in direction of the alts - with only short term swings back. Right now we're close to Bitcoin going below the 50% market share.   
I think typically people make a lot of money with Bitcoin, and then look into alts for even more gains. At the end they care probably most about getting more Bitcoin. But they will rarely move back fully.
As for the scaling, there are some alts on the horizon that offer solutions. One is Iota (which supposedly will work very differently, so I don't really understand it) and Ardor (which exists as test version, and will scale at a fraction of the amount of other cryptos).

And l'd be down with your statement, but they'll mix all these things up to make all bitcoin activity look shady.   
I think already the $4 billion number hints at that. Where does it come from? It only adds up if they call all BTC-E users money launderers.  
You'll hear it in the mainstream soon enough: 'Bitcoin exchanges are just for money laundering.'  
They abuse legitimate causes like that. Like when the U.S. was attacked by a Saudi living in Afghanistan, and they used that to invade Iraq. Most Americans believed Iraq was involved in 9/11.

Was more of a general observation. I rarely get why some posts on reddit get downvoted.


I dunno - sure it's always complicated if you go into the details, but that men are dominant in our culture is hard to talk away. It's now maybe less obvious - but in our history it's 100% crystal clear. To think it's now magically over is wishful thinking. Just like every generation declares that racism ended - and we now look back and say that all earlier generations were blatantly racist. 
Reading this thread here it becomes harder and harder to say that there is no misogyny going on.

Maybe because you're not explaining it well. It can't be really all about the smile, right? Because you woudln't accept Syrians if they would just smile more.
It's also pretty clear that you wouldn't be happy about "almost any nationality" if you then list only rich white nations. Why not use 2 million Kenyans as example? Hm - maybe it was rather more about the amount then? And how different they are from you?

Segwit2x seemed to have little reason to exist, other than preventing BIP148. Out of thin air it created the argument of "why not wait for this other Segwit option".  
I consider it a stalling technique, with [the additional benefit ]( to establish a repository that the current core devs are not willing to participate on. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise, by showing a path how the users are still in the driving seat - and not some corporations that secretly met in some room in New York City (was it close to Wall Street?)   
And what will the core devs do then? Leave? Create another Bitcoin - or new coin? Either way there won't be smooth sailing.

You're leaving out the crucial part: it's backed by BTS. Not by fiat.

But it's not. If BTS collapses more than 2 (or 3) times (or BTC rises), then no one will pay back.
 


The idea to have 200% collateral is certainly not new. We didn't need BitUSD to come up with that.  Neither does it need blockchains.

It's not just about believing claims - you should test their software. If you find no use for it, don't buy it.   
I know it takes a ton of time, but else you're bound to make bad decisions. It's really comparable to the stock market. One shouldn't just buy ton's of stocks from random companies one knows nothing about. Sure, some people get rich that way - buying and selling penny stocks. But most get burned in the long run.

If some noob thought that an exchange is a sort of wallet, then I can understand it. Getting the grip of it is tough. But if you're in so deep, then you had to be aware of this - including how shady BTC-E is. There's not a lot of room for excuses.

I wouldn't be sure. First it will create uncertainty. If it goes back to users (either Gox or BTC-E) it might equal itself out. But it could mean the government has their hands on another huge cache of coin. And they might dump it.  
One of those situations where (when also keeping Alphabay and Co in mind), the market seems strangely stable considering all the open questions. Probably huge drops coming the next weeks.

For one: It's expensive, so I expect more than indie-graphics. And also: My point that it looked better in the versions a year ago.  
Thirdly, it's not new: Spore did it. And better as far as I see .... still wasn't the most awesome game, since just randomizing thousands of planets is actually pretty boring.  
It can be done well, still curious to see reviews, but so far I don't see the innovations that solve the Spore issues.

Ehhm, no.   
You can't compare Bitcoin banking to fiat banking. In Bitcoin you don't have a state-backed guarantee that you'll get (most of) your funds back if there is a bankruptcy. 
No one should keep coins at a Bitcoin bank unless it's for a transaction. And if you can't handle setting up a simple wallet at some of the providers, then you should just not touch Bitcoin yet.

That's not really a solution for scaling. The problem is that if demand for transactions gets as high as in in Bitcoin, then both Ether's and Monero's blockchains will be 10 to 100 times bigger.

Yes exactly - free-er. Not free.


Great, then I'll talk to myself. Here is what I say:  
- It's absurd to say that "everyone" is more prosper now.  
- Germany is quite far from a free market.  
- You can't just interpolate from "it got more free and prospered" to "if it's fully free it's even better". It's like downing someone who asked for a glass of water. 


Also depends on you definition of invisible hand. The one used now is basically the opposite of what Adam Smith had in mind. See - that's how mythical those things have become.  
As for the "Markets are efficient" - we know very well they aren't. That's science vs. libertarian campaign speeches.

We clearly disagree on the problem. And that affects the solution.

Ok, my grammar is bad - but even when re-reading I can't figure where I promoted affirmative action.


Maybe you can explain what you mean by that. I would be curious about solutions. As for myself: Apart from cutting out the sexism (that we see in this reddit disscussion for example) and also doing an outreach, I don't have specific suggestions yet.

People apparently just read into my text whatever they like. How about replying to things I've actually said?


Which brings us to a point I actually made: You're not willing to adopt to the needs of others. If you're shaping the Bitcoin environment, it by simple logic means you're excluding these groups.  
Now in your comment you're turning them into a flat stereotype. But the principle works just as well in lesser cases - of needs you might not even know of, because you don't interact with them. The environment is shaped to your needs - and forgets or ignores others needs. There is no conspiracy needed to create a hostile environment.

I think the government could very effectively attack mining. See drugs: While trading goes on, the growing had been basically eradicated in the US. Mining would be similar - it needs big energy inputs, that can be detected. Once the mining is low, the government can easily take 51% (even just using the confiscated gear, let alone some NSA tech).

You're just uninformed. Alts are used a lot for commerce. They used to have many times more transactions compared to Bitcoin if you adjust them to the market-cap. So they were more used than they were given credit for (this probably changed with the recent boom).

It's strange how people seem to think the Bitcoin environment is nothing but the core formula. Obviously there are 100s of services around it - there are interfaces, and there are communities. To assume all those are just neutral is absurd.  
I would even think to say that the "core math is absolutely neutral" is strange. It's a process designed for specific function. In that it has assumptions in there what functions are important and which aren't.

Let's not pretend anyone of us is some magical oracle. None of us knows what exactly is going on. And nothing that happens is entirely for one single reason alone.

Only if the assumption is true that the difficulty will adjust. But as far as I know we're not even close to the amount of miners needed. Until then, if we take the $1 price the article suggests, then mining the chain would mean a huge loss. The energy bill will be equal than the old high bitcoin price. 
Until the adjustment we might have one block a day (as written by OP). Seems to me that would mean the chain is less worth to traders - it's an unusable chain. Being useless for two weeks seems a long time.

What a ridiculous argument. So by that logic you should accept the state torturing you because the torturers they hired are not getting paid a lot. Just be nice, they're just doing what they're told?
I'm personally convinced the TSA procedures are 90% about putting people in place. Showing them who is boss, and who has to follow ridiculous orders. The more absurd and illogical the orders are, the better: "follow all your items.... I'll now take one item through the screen ... you are not allowed to follow". Or just think of those "are you a terrorist", "do you carry a nuclear bomb" questions you have to fill out in the travel forms. You get trained to follow orders.   
Even in the exchange above it is clear that most of this is about accepting authority. Nearly none of it is about security.
Incidentally the TSA agents get screened too: Who is willing to abuse people without speaking up. Only way to keep your minimum wage job... who is best at it gets a chance to step up in the hierarchy.

I disagree with most of this.
- Bitcoins main problem are the fees right now, not lack of innovation. There is tons of stuff happening around bitcoin - fees are stifling it.
- I have yet to see proof that the innovation of Ethereum has to happen in smart contracts. Why does all computation have to run on there, and not just the data storage and verification? This is creating more problems (scaling is a much worse issue for Ether) than it solves.
- Out of experience with former ICO bubbles, I doubt that many of the current ones will result in anything. If for 100% of all ICO investment only 1% value is created, then lots of value is destroyed. This will become a huge problem (even if it's 5% or so at the end).
- Why is the Ether bubble even an issue for Bitcoin? Who cares. If there are two big cryptos, then it's in fact a good thing - it makes the ecosystem more anti-fragile. Let's hope there will be three or four.

Really depends on the amount. $1k  ... maaaaybe. But 170k would be far far above the limit that I would store on an internet connected machine. That's a life-changing amount (would be for me at least). Consider also that bitcoin might do another 10x. Then you have millions stored on possibly compromised tech. An office fire or break-in would have also be a total loss.   
And storing the key on the cloud (as OP apparently tried) is even worse.
Proper hardware solutions are cheap, even compared to $1k.

They say that several people made millions in the crash. I suppose the whale that started the whole show did also - this was a massive sell order. Must have been for huge profit.   
So if all that will be reimbursed, we're looking at several million bucks ... maybe 5 or more?
That won't be a rounding error to anyone. 
They say all worked fine according to the rules. So they dish out millions as present to users (of which they have more than they can handle anyways)? That smells very fishy.   
It would be unwise management of company funds - and set a real hazardous precedent. Can users that set bad orders now all demand reimbursements?

I think this could be huge if it stays a pattern. Right now nearly **all** other asset classes are dropping.

Just guessing here, but exchanges have usually a single (or limited amount) of accounts they use. Like one hot-wallet to deal with all users. If one transaction in them gets stuck, and that would mean they can't do any other transactions anymore, then that would make it impossible for them to function.
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:09:57
As much as I agree with what you say, one major issue I have is that all of that was foreseeable since years.  
We all saw the fact that the Chinese miners were dominating and growing even stronger. We knew that ASICs were a bottleneck giving manufactures even more power. This was ignored. Now we sow the storm because of this complacency.
May I add: the system to settle such disputes also just seems terribly inadequate. We now have about 5 scenarios of what will happen to Bitcoin in August. And no one seems to have any  certainty where it'll go (or all sides are equally certain they'll win).   
That can't be the system how the global currency will be run.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:33:07
On paper Blockchain.info is OK - since you will have access even if they go bankrupt. In practice though they have been unreliable. Switching to a better wallet should be preferred, especially since technical turmoil is looming.  
I don't really see why it needs to be a hardware wallet. It makes no difference as long as Bip148, is supported.
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:13:46

Ok, good explanation, makes sense.   
I would say though: These other suggestions seem to have little progress, and seem actually rather unlikely at this point. UASF is a way to stop the stalemate. A stalemate that possibly benefits malevolent miners - who have then an interest to drag this out forever.
Edit: Actually... thinking about it more, it seems a rather strange argument you make. So you don't argue that BIP148 is bad or risky in any way. It's only because miners don't want it that it becomes risky. Miners that then claim they'll activate it later.   
So why are the miners then causing the disruption?
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:53:12
But how does that translate to 'Ethereum scales better'? Bitcoin can also move to expensive servers.   
Also it's the trajectory that's the issue. If the chain has to move to special hardware now, then once it's mass-used, it'll be affordable only for a few big institutions.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:19:32
I find this extremely frustrating. I'm reading extensively about Bitcoin every day - and yet this stuff is way too complicated to understand. At the end I have no clue what will happen - one day on r/Bitcoin it seems BIP148 will go through without a hitch, the next day everyone seems to agree it will be a non starter, and at most disrupt everything. Will all investors get screwed for the next couple years again?   
All I can say: The wider public can never trust a system that is run like this. Maybe decentralization just doesn't work - and what's left over will be altcoins that are controlled by Goldman Sachs bankers. I hate it - maybe the FUD is just getting to me - but that's where it seems to be heading.

I mean... you're not wrong. No single short war has caused as much harm to the whole world at one time. But I'm not sure if it says all that much. It could just mean technology made war more international. Before wars were merely local - in stone age times even just between little tribes - and still the amount of violent deaths was probably higher. As someone pointed out below: The mongols killed much more percent of the world population.
And consider that the war hardly made an impact on population growth. The world population absolutely exploded in the same time frame. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:53:38

Serious question: did you think before writing this? Is it just a reflex?
I mean... I'm OK with proper arguments that touching people's genitals will prevent bombs on planes - if that's the case. It's worth the trade-off.  
But how is "flying is a privilege" even an argument? Can they just rape people randomly, because if you don't enjoy that then don't fly? Can other things be denied to me like that... can let's say book shops now say to customers they choose: "let us touch your genitals, else you can't buy books".   
Because ... you know ... buying books is a privilege, not a right.  
I don't think it works like that - not legally, and especially not morally.

I've read good arguments for and against bigger blocks. But I haven't come across any against Segwit. What's the problem? Short term it's essentially a doubling of the block size - and in the long term it'll allow the Lightning network, so will fix the transaction bottleneck.  
Sidechains seem far far off.

Fantastic analogy. Just a shame the talk didn't go then into what it means for the current race - like how much of a chance will BIP148 have. Seems like a tough order.   
But one thing is clear: If miners (or any other group) gets the full control over the recipe, then the whole system has failed.

There are exactly two: they use ASICboost, or they do not.  
One assumes that they invested big sums of money to develop and build this into their hardware, and then don't use it. The other scenario assumes they do what they made this for.  
To call the second one a conspiracy is a total misnomer.


You must have missed the 'covert' in 'covert ASICboost'. We have no hard evidence because it's designed that way. We do have good hints though that it is indeed used.

Vitalik and the Foundation has cashed out a lot  - and has been open about it. It would be stupid and highly irresponsible if they would have only kept Ether - any crash would have destroyed their business.

Guessing 's point here: If  indeed "all Ethereum wallets are down" on several exchanges because of scaling issues... then it's not scaling better.

@_date: 2017-06-17 14:17:08
So the chains will split from the same point on (August 1st in that case). Meaning all earlier transactions are the same. If one chain is the clear accepted winner, then everyone will use that one, and there are no problems.   
If not, then things get complicated for users. Exchanges might often allow trading of both with clear labeling (and some announced that). Bad wallets might lead to issues when one user thinks they send on chain A, but really do on chain B. Let's hope that doesn't happen.

Yeah, but that is a bit circular. Miners don't want it because it's creates uncertainty - and it only creates uncertainty because miners don't want it. Notably they quickly came up with a scheme how they want it later.  
That leads me to think that the 2x proposal it's only a stall tactic, that creates a counter-argument out of thin air where there was none before. And by extension, they won't go through with 2x either when it's closer ... they'll come up with a new reason to push it. I'll set RemindMe! in 4 months, let's see if I was wrong.


It's some bankers getting together secretly in the middle of the night, to craft up some policy that the rest will have to accept. That's why I have a bad gut reaction to it. Wasn't that the thing Bitcoin was made against? And wouldn't it be in their interest to further evaporate the power of users to resist?

I've experienced the same in NXT - so I should have seen it coming. For a while most new ICOs were on NXT, which drove the price up. It's not even just that the companies will then hold - it's also just that Ether will be stuck in ordering books and such - slimming down the supply.   
NXT was exploding back then - but then a lot of bad stuff happened. Some hacks (on exchanges not NXT itself), which shook the price. And then most ICO's turned to dust. Maybe one or two of a hundred turned into something (NEM comes to mind). At the end it turned people off and they rightfully lost their trust in the ICOs. At the end it wasn't good for NXT either - it took the focus from the tech, and tarnished the image.
It's the same ingredients, but all turned up to 11: much more money. Worse codebase. A central authority. And the will to change the blockchain if the outcome isn't favorable. 
I won't feel bad for missing out on the earnings. You can't know when this will explode - might be 5 years, might have been yesterday. But I personally can not imagine this not ending in tears.

But why is it risky? Only because miners don't like it. While they are saying they will like it in the future in some proposal they are working on.

You say it like it's some kind of religious belief that just comes down to personal convictions. But this is as much a hard number-problem as it gets. So if you can't prove what you claim, then it's wrong.   
Here are the facts so far:  
- Ethereum by definition has much more transactions - because it does much more stuff, and by it's own aim supports infinite kinds of transactions.    
- Ethereum is much much younger than Bitcoin, and already has a bigger chain.   
- Extrapolating this means that without major innovations the problem will get much worse much faster than with Bitcoin

Could someone explain what's the difference between BIP141 and BIP148? For all I know, they both mean Segwit.

Boring is a good description. When the price fell in 2014, it was exciting. Crazy news each day - like when they found Satoshi, or when people where camping in front of Gox. Repeated huge heists. Now the most exciting thing is idiots doing an dumb hash-war nobody should give a shit about anyways.
   
Also back then it felt like it made sense that the price should go down after the China ban and the biggest exchange collapsing. But now? It doesn't even add up. Bitcoin is in a vastly better position than even last year. A correction made sense... but a 80% drop? No way. That makes it more annoying than the other crashes. And not even the memes are as good as they used to be.

Yea.

What is economic majority? It would have to be coin holders, that also run nodes or miners. Firstly, a huge chunk of that would be the Ether Foundation itself. All the rest run nodes mostly on "auto-update". In essence there is no possible majority that could diverge from Buterin's wishes. At the most you'll get an Ether-Classic-V2 or so.

If we're bashing alts, then we should also mention their innovation: Ardor is specifically developed (since more than a year) to tackle scaling.
Here is a [calculation comparing Ardor's blockchain size to Nxt](

What do you mean with "recent"? Because Bitfinex wasn't long ago.

Exists already for crypto to crypto. But vs. fiat it won't be possible - you'll need a bank there somewhere.

Once you own any substantial sum in anything, you'll quickly learn all you can about it. I have trust in that motivator.

Somehow I would be fine with $20k.  
The situation around bitcoin is **way** better tough than two years ago. No community split. BCH dead. And institutions moving in. If we repeat 2017 hype, the bubble will go to $40k.

That argument always struck me as strange. Gold and silver have very limited real world use. 
But Gold is dealt at $1200 - it may have $20 intrinsic value if it's lucky. So roughly 99% imagined value.
If I add the fact that you typically don't deal in gold in the market, only about the promise of gold (don't think bankers often push around wheelbarrows all that often), then the difference to cryptocurrencies seems evens smaller.

Yeh it's considered a good wallet. If you buy Bitcoins now, it'll end up on both chains. August 1 May be a critical date to be careful around when transacting. Well have to see.

According to the [wiki list]( that is a top post here now, none of the Bitcoin developers support it.  
...that thing doesn't even have a full technical proposal yet.

Do I understand that right that they will pocket all rewards as long as it's private? And only later (at what point?) allow other miners to join?   
Sounds too bizarre to be correct.

I find it amazing that even for the most distant event - no matter how obviously horrible - and how clearly history made a judgement on, there is still at least one guy on the internet defending it.

Better link (by the actual institute): 
They say they asked 1000 of their online members - of which they have 140.000+. The group is representative of the online population according to their research.
Besides what it says in the headline, it adds that 33% of the Dutch people know what a bitcoin is (43% of men, and about 25% of woman), and a further 41% heard about it, but don't know what it is exactly. 
A bit surprising to me: 18 to 24 year olds know less about it than 25 to 34 year olds.
3% expect that the current monetary system will be replaced by Bitcoin. While about 25% think it will never be used generally.
Social media in the Netherlands is very active about the coin - mostly positive, and mostly about the swings in exchange rates.
Two personal cents: Dutch people I know, are very interested. I was surprised that people even know well how the rate is. Then again, the Dutch get this trading knowledge with their mothers milk :D

Lol, they seem to be seriously math challenged in the video. "Bitcoin can fall 200 to 300%"
and "the chance is 1 in 7000 ... and even that possibility is a slim one"

Anything illegal stopping on bitcoin I would count as good thing in the long run. It raises the trust of the general population.
Thats what you want, if you're not only caring about moment to moment speculation.
