my dad is 73 and used to work in silicon valley in the 70's, when i told him about Bitcoin a few years ago he told me straight away it's good because it's easy to move (which i didn't realize, i was just into the Anarchic thing), and wanted to move all his money out of the US with it, but i told him not to because it was too volatile LOL.
I noticed he checks the price a lot on his phone.
My mom is 72 age and knows nothing about tech, she's quit spiritual, but when i told her about Bitcoin she wanted some because she said she wants to be part of the future and sees this is where the future is going. She says it will take 50 years+ to get there.

i thought it was silly and well, misinformation, that in the movie you have to go to some weirdos criminal to get cash for bitcoin
Also, "I don't give a fuck about that Occupy Aron Swartz bullshit" f*** you to :)
