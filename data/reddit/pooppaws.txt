I am new to bitcoins so forgive me if I am wrong, but why would the USA government allow these cards to be sold? I just can't see how they would allow wal-mart to carry these is stores in America. I hope I am wrong, let me know.

Haha. Damn. Didnt even think of that. They say half of bitcoin transactions are gambling... I bet the other half are for silk road.

Exactly. Think of it this way, if difficulty falls and makes it profitable then more people will start mining raising the difficulty. When it gets raised to the point of not being profitable then people will slow down or stop till it reaches break even point.

If you sell them then yes, if you don't and the price drops then it doesn't really make a difference.
