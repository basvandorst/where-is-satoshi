Buy goods and services with crypto and the value of those goods and services is transferred to the crypto you used to pay for them. The process creates real economic value and stabilizes the price
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:02:06
Exactly. I was one of those idiots who thought that bitcoin is not real enough when it was under ten cents and even up to 40 bucks and just wouldn't invest thinking that's not real only to be devastated when it reached nearly 1300. Didn't even feel like mining back in 2009/10 because it took too long for the wallet to sync. Ridiculous, looking back. Would have been the easiest mega gain ever and that's the lesson right there

You don't have to believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is merely the start of crypto. Crypto is bound to grow because of blockchain development and real world integration. Owning btc or eth means you're ready to invest into blockchain before big things happen. Look at the market caps of the top 20 coins. There's a reason investors are holding

Not fictitious. It's selling the same Bitcoin to multiple parties and safekeeping it for them �� �� buy more cheaper �� rinse and repeat. Like whales, except it's regulated and insured, whatever that means

This is good as it increases adoption. But ⚠ Look up "off chain rehypothecation". See "How Commingling And Rehypothecation Affect Bitcoin" on Investopedia

Back in 2013 this would be exactly right. Now a 6K coin is too risky for most people which is why institutional money is a necessity. If you look at the btc market cap you can see that 250B need to go into btc alone for the btc price to get back to just 20K. For the whole crypto market to recover and make solid gains you need an investment of at least 3/4 trillion usd
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:35:22
Once you've made crazy gains you cash in. It just happened (again) this past Dec/Jan/Feb. It's normal

Because btc has to go above 12,000
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:44:53
Stable like Fiat at 10% annual inflation?
For "stability" you have Fiat and traditional investing
Crypto/btc has to grow for the blockchain industry to grow and develop and vice versa. If btc is stable altcoins sink and the market/industry with it. Crypto is only a store of value if there's widespread use for goods and services. Without it it's going nowhere
