Except in this case the McDonalds desperately wants to be named Burger King and gets offended when you call it Maccie D's.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:32:49
Yeah Bcash is a hard fork and SW is a soft fork, after which the original chain ceased existing.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:52:35
Doesn't even reach the top 75.
@_date: 2019-07-26 09:53:07
It also isn't a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:59:39
The future of cryptocurrency relies on mainstream adoption.
This is bigger than just "investing," we are trying to build the economy of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:39:35
There is no legal basis for banning those kinds of transactions. I want bitcoin, you want thing, let's trade. They cannot legally ban you from trading like that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:01:00
I meant unstable as in price, not unstable as in tech
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:57:05
It 100% is unstable. And it most certainly is a threat to the economy. Just how it is supposed to be. Just how we like it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:28:00
That would cause REAL confusion due to there being roughly a million coins that should be named shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:31:23
Hey man that could be Bitcoin Gold or Diamond or some other bitcoin shitfork.
@_date: 2019-03-03 20:46:35
I'm from South Africa, can confirm it was a thing here in the early 2000s.
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:59:48
The same can be said for money in a bank account, tbh. Or most assets, really.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:21:10
One does not simply mine a block on a blockchain with BTC difficulty but a fraction of the BTC hashrate.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:31:37
FORK IS OFFICIAL...now they just actually need to mine a block :D
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:07:37
Mining is useless if nobody puts transactions on your network.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:29:04
I was using Blockchair but it seems to be dead now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:06:55
Where do you use gold to buy food? 
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:22:37
If it ain't a security it is MUUUUUUUUUUUUUCH less regulated, basically.
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:29:47
Well if you want to move money via Bitcoin, you first need to use that money to buy bitcoin, and the receiver on the other side needs to sell it, considering we do not yet live in a world where it is feasible to use cryptocurrency for day-to-day use or even for storing your money.
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:19:52
Yeah I don't think we've had a non-pool block in a very long time.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:23:24
I'm fully with you that Bitcoin will be money. I'm just saying we ain't there yet. Money needs a stable price. Money needs near-universal acceptance at point of payment.
I'm not saying it's never going to happen, hell I'm reasonably certain it will, I'm just saying that today, 12 August 2019, we ain't there yet.
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:42:39
LOL or even better you run the client on your PC for shits and giggles and on your first hash you get a block :D
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:48:44
Dragonslayer conspiracy more like dragonfeeder amirite.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:45:52
History is filled with failed currencies and governments.
You know what never fails? Math.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:57:38
:D :D :D :D
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:11:22
Dude the real whales are coming.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:45:04
It is backed by the world's only superpower. We are the superpower. The people.
Fuck government control of money, basically.
@_date: 2019-02-04 09:57:06
Alegal means the government hasn't recognized it but also hasn't outright banned it. Unknown means the person who made the map has no clue what the bitcoin rules are in that country.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:30:00
Well, I guess that's why he kept saying "on-chain." He knows there are off-chain second layer solutions, but the point here was looking at the on-chain goals of the two.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:21:57
Well I'm sure Luno is pocketing a nice share, but also people are running scared from the junk status thing today ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:56:42
That is if the B2X even has any value to sell for.  I'm thinking (and hoping) that it will be DOA.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:36:13


How well does it work? I've been considering it, but these crypto debit cards worry me ever so slightly.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:01:03
A big banker that actually understands value. Damn.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:41:59
It's almost as if bitcoin works exactly as intended when it isn't under attack by a malicious altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:31:57
Anyone who bought XRP? :D
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:00:41
Well consider Bitcoin as more of a part of an investment portfolio than a 100% wealth store, so everyone would have much less BTC than their total wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:13:53
Well it would make sense that they could perhaps do something like that.
What would be interesting is if by such a point it has evolved to a level where you could just pay your mortgage or buy commodities directly with BTC instead of using USD as a middleground
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:57:08
oh man I really hope you are right, needs to buy myself some cheap bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:49:31
If you understand how BTC works you know giving out the public address is not dangerous at all. The only thing someone can do with that is give you more money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:42:43
I mean, BTC is currently using like 0.15% of the world's electricity. It uses more electricity per year than all of Ireland, and a bunch of other small countries as well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:54:55
They want to see the public address to confirm the authenticity of the story.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:11:24
Honestly, I think it's a terrible idea.  The mainstream market is confused enough as it is, when they see their investments changing name and others with the same name popping up it is just going to get confusing and put them off of it, further delaying the mainstream adoption of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:45:00
Well one assumption you make here is that USD is the only currency.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:23
Quoting random stats is what I do best ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
Didn't mean anything else by it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:48:13
Which they do already anyway.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:28:53
Except all his bitcoins are still where he left them.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:10:18
Lol troll
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:20:11
I refer you to the last entry which is the internet.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:40:28
Are you saying for cryptocurrencies to live Bitcoin needs to die?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:53:42
Guys please. If he was trying to crash the market he would drop 180k of Bitcoin at like 1K.
He's clearly just trying to recover the money, spreading it out over a long time to limit the impact on the market.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:23:53
2x hard fork if it even happens.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:55:03
Look it might be a bubble but if it is it still has a lot of growing to do before it bursts.  10x at least.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:52:20
Well at least Roger isn't trying to claim to be Satoshi
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:43:59
People have been saying that since it was $100.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:58:37
Community consensus. More than 50% of the network uses the main Bitcoin network and calls it real bitcoin and thusly it is. Somewhere next month we'll see if what 'real' bitcoin is changes.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:18:43
China coming in to make BTC mining profitable for the common folk again :D.  If Jihan gets kicked off BTC mining just imagine the sheer difficulty drop.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:59:31
There is still mining, but the reward comes from transactions fees only, not new release from mining.
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:58:06
Still curious, on the entirely BTC one, is your income stipulated in BTC or in fiat? I guess it's feasible to do it straight up in BTC right now, but if more volatility returns it could be quite expensive for either you or the company paying you.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:53:00
It's essentially a high-risk high-reward investment at the moment, not really a currency, despite what people would have you believe.
If one day BTC or some other crypto becomes mainstream enough to actually be a viable sort of global currency, the stability will surely follow as it's value will become more concrete.  Right now the value is driven by demand for the BTC itself, when it becomes a viable currency the value will be driven by the things you can buy with it.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:15:25
It's no more of a Ponzi scheme than the current financial system of the world.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:58:16
So like, if the stock market crashes what happens in crypto? Will people run to here?
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:45:30
You understand that this confirmation was basically "Yes, yes I am Satoshi".
They don't ask for any real proof, because that is not their purpose.
There is only one irrefutable way for him to prove that he is Satoshi, and he has thus far been unable to do that.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:08:31
I vote to name it BitcoinStupid.
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:47:34
I believe to get access to this you need to drive to a physical copyright office office.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:01:44
That is heavily dependant on what the market does :D
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:28:20
You still pay a shitload in miners fees and have to hang around until it  confirms.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:24:11
It's almost as if when more people use it the network fills up.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:11:06
That's not Ethereum itself, but one pool with a big hashrate majority (basically the Jihan of the Eth world) decided to mess with order by mining empty blocks and shit to get themselves in the front of the line for the ICO.
