If you prefer bitcoin as cash rather than a store of value then you should be getting out of bitcoin into bitcoin cash or hoping that segwit2x succeeds, because there is no way for bitcoin to become a widespread currency with its current transaction fees and slow confirmation times.
And there's nothing wrong with that, in fact I think it's the correct choice if you actually believe in bitcoin's value as a currency, which I think you do.

You are basing your opinion on a couple instances of anecdotal evidence whereas the article i told you to read has over 100 pieces of documented evidence that makes it glaringly obvious that censorship is occurring. I don't see how anyone who reads it can still claim there is no censorship.
Your logic is the same as me claiming that because my grandfather who smokes 3 packs a day lived to be 100 years old and never caught lung cancer, tobacco doesn't cause lung cancer.

Not true at all, majority of people believes a block size increase is needed. Majority however does not believe it should be done like it is in segwit2x, which is with the community split and a weak development team.
The reason you do not see anyone going against the arbitrary 1mb limit anymore on this subreddit is because the vast majority of people who go against it get banned or censored.

Satoshi's vision as stated in the white paper is that consensus be reached with a vote using CPU power. You are the one misrepresenting bitcoin. The whitepaper states what bitcoin is, and you must understand that when you are coming in. So if it is clearly stated that consensus is to be reached with cpu power, then that is what it is. No twitter polls or reddit votes.
You are the one misrepresenting Satoshi. Satoshi does not use the word "community" a single time in the white paper. So by saying you agree with him and then acting like your definition is the correct one when his is different, that is complete bs.
People act like decentralized means they have a vote in everything. Since when does every internet user vote on changes to the internet protocol? This isnt a political vote. It's a vote made by those who are supporting the bitcoin network as was decided from its inception.

And if I wanna send litecoin they will get it instant and it will cost 1 cent, same with bitcoin cash. See how it is so much more practical? I dont think everyone who wants to send crypto to a friend is willing to go through that painful process.

Am I on r/bitcoin right now? It's crazy to see someone this sensible here.

Well first I think it's hilarious that you somehow expect me to know every post you've made on the lightning network like you're some kind of twitter celebrity.
Second it is very obvious that lightning network isnt going to magically fix all of bitcoin's issues. Sure, maybe it will speed it up a bit and lower fees a bit as well. But they will still be very high and still nowhere near as fast as other cryptocurrencies.
People will eventually realize that first mover advantage isn't everything and that there are much better cryptocurrencies than bitcoin out there. That is, if people keep trying to prevent a block size increase forever.

Agreed, completely blew his point lol

What a load of horseshit. Segwit adoption is down 33%, and fees and transaction times are still garbage. I cannot send $10 of bitcoin to a friend without losing 20% of it, how is that low? Do you feel no shame in spouting such lies? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:05:02
Except it is. Otherwise why would transaction fees and confirmation times be so high when they weren't? And funnily enough these issues would disappear with gradual block size increases like Satoshi said. It's almost like one side is trying to improve bitcoin while the other side is pointlessly limiting its potential...

It's good. They are sticking to the whitepaper's definition of consensus and not making up their own like other exchanges and NO2X people.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:25:11
No one is atracking you. They are making bitcoin better. If Segwit2x wins you will not have lost money, in fact you will have lower transaction fees and better confirmation times. I don't understand why anyone would see it as an attack.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:06:28
Please tell me where in the white paper the word "community" is used. Bitcoin consensus is decided through CPU power. That is the rule. Your arbitrary definition of consensus is irrelevant. Not to mention your 85% is literally pulled out of your ass because unlike the CPU vote which counts what everyone is mining at a specific time to determine their position, you are using random reddit community observations that are completely subjective.

No the actually correct decision would be to name btc b1x and 2X as b2x and let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:48:16
I accept whatever coinbase decides because I can't change it. I'm just stating what I think. So no its not in much pain
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:01:34
Because B2X is meant to be a network upgrade, that is why it doesn't have replay protection. No one says they want to buy B2X because if all goes well B2X will become Bitcoin itself. Ethereum has done this 5 times now, with the latest one considerably decreasing the difficulty.
The ones who are misinformed are the ones who oppose 2X. A network upgrade is not a bad thing, and neither is a block size increase. How long will btc keep a 1mb limit for no reason? Until the transaction fees are so high you need $10 minimum to send a single satoshi? The limit is the equivalent of a PS3 using a PS2 8MB memory card and thinking it wont make a difference.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:22:41
But signaling isn't being used for the upgrade, it is just a signal of what they will supposedly vote for. If I signal NYA and keep mining B1X I wont be supporting NYA even though I signalled it. It will be decided with CPU power, as is written in the whitepaper.

Are you saying people aren't censored on this subreddit? Please search "r/bitcoin censorship history" and read the Medium post by John Blocke. There is a very well documented history of censorship on this subreddit and you are living in a bubble if you think otherwise.
