Does the delay have anything to do with not using two factor authentication?

Some savants just effortlessly know the right nonce...

.mp4 are not 100% save either. If there is a security flaw in the decoder, even video files with valid extensions can include malware.

I don't buy that  virtue signalling morals and politics bullshit. There's no reason to use anything else, all that counts is if the service works for you as expected.
If you find something better, sure use that, but don't change to something worse for you, because of emotions.

Never use any website for this, if you can do it on your device with a program you trust. 
Websites and Domains could be manipulated by nefarious people at any time. 
If you absolutely have to, at least scan the code and compare it with the original value.   
If you need to scan it multiple times, save the image to your own device first, so it doesn't get changed in between uses. Changes in QR codes can be very hard to notice.
I just realized this sounds too much like DIY or at least use protection...

Can you please elaborate on what the mess is and what should be improved?

I am aware this is so please don't kill me reddit. I am just sharing my personal view, which might be wrong and biased. If so, please educate me.
I not an expert on Ethereum, but I see it more as an evolving Infrastructure, that is still in heavy development. A high risk project, that might bring rewards in a few years. I agree that there is some messiness to the development process, but that's can easily happen when software gets developed open source, especially if the project is a moving target. Ethereum gets developed based on ongoing research. It's easier to have no mess, if there is a clear path to reach the goal from the beginning.
Proof of stake is a big deal, if it can replace or augment PoW without relevant downsides. It would be a lot more compelling to stake ether, than do "pointless" hash calculations that require a lot of energy, and are only worth doing in conditions with dirt cheap electricity.
Plasma and Sharding for scaling are work in progress. Some plasma implementations apparently already work.
Decentralized Exchanges are a good purpose already.
If one wanted to build a Platform to sell actual ownership of digital assets, like music, games or videos, that can be traded, and won't die when one company goes insolvent, Ethereum could be a goof platform. 
No need for Netflix, Spotify, Steam, if you can publish your content yourself, and get payed easily, minus the cost of hosting it on the network, available for as long as some interested party pays the fees or archives it.
I find these possibilities way more promising to provide actual value long term than other Blockchains.

Which aspects you consider misconceptions, and based on what information?
To me it doesn't matter what Ethereum is now, it matters what potential it has, based on its goals.
It might not be worth discussing though, as there's no way of knowing what the situation will be like in 2-3 years. Ambitious projects can fail a lot easier than simple ones, but the also have potential to be revolutionary. There's no innovation without someone doing things, while some people think he's crazy spending time doing what they can not envision. I'm not saying that Ethereum is magically great, but they are at least working on something that could be immensely useful.
To me this is not about Ethereum vs. Bitcoin either. It's okay to have different things for different needs, and as you say, Bitcoin could evolve into something more too, if they have that as a goal.
There's something good about crypto in general already though. A lot of people learned about asymmetric cryptography, who wouldn't have cared otherwise. And it has brought people together to develop something new. 
I do not worry about Shitcoins. When programming became widely available in the 80s with the first popular home computers, there was a lot of shitty programming too, by people trying what they can achieve.
Same when the Web became popular in the 90s, and "everyone" built their own Website for no good reason..
Same with Kickstarter a couple years ago. Among good ones there were a lot of shit projects trying something out. Altcoins are not much different.
Without trying, we can't know what is possible, so I consider it valuable.

He might not understand the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, and assume there's just one "password" for everyone, not realizing that would require an honor system.

The optimist would say, it can only go down a couple $1000, but it can go up trillions!!!
