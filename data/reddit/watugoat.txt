@_date: 2017-09-11 08:31:18
I was just quoting the article in link
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:59:22
What is a step by step process of buying and storing your first bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:10:45
£835, I think the whales will play around a bit more and then re buy and hold until all the plankton buys more to push the bitcoin worth up again, the whales will then do the same again and sell up and pretty much kill off bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:26:11
What bird laid the orange egg?

@_date: 2017-09-11 21:29:28
Yes the buy price is higher than the sell price
@_date: 2017-09-12 07:38:46
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:01:34

@_date: 2017-09-09 17:07:45
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:54:12
