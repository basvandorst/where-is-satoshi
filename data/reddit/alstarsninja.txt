The halting problem states that u cannot be sure when a turing complete program will terminate or in other worda end its execution.
This problem is solved by a workaround witch is that a smart contract cannot run forever because it needs Gas for executing.
Joke of a jargon feature? Did not get that
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:31:21
Because f statistics :p

Not only the nonce affects the hash but also the transactions they chose to include in the block.
The time stamp also affects the block's hash and that changes every second
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:49:43
And the dialogue just got started :p ( in my opinion )
I can see your point of view
I believe that bitcoin is not technologicly superior compared to some altcoins but it is battle hardened and it has a very interesting community (interesting is the word i use because i cant find a verb to describe it)
Lost myself in the conversation but i can conclude on this, its bigger that all of us :D
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:21:01
Aaaand you are getting down oted time to buy alts
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:26:59
Even if bitcoin become the defacto currency, will everyone be involved in issuance and control?
If the answer is no what do you have to say to those that dont?
Try not to answer like the ones you are trying to overthrow..
I myself cant handle this question
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:30:03
And im here thinking...Do they give out loans?
Edit: If yes at what rate? :p
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:15:10
I dont want to unsub though.. I dont want bitcoin to become a purist only thing..
Bitcoin does not solve all problems and we have to understand that.Thinking that will make u blind to the ghing going wrong about it..
I got into this thing because i believe no System is perfect and none ever will..There is aleays room to grow
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:18:25
When then
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:27:18
That was a good dialogue btw
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:40:52
Then they invented really smart solutions that were ahead of their time to dolvr that
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:41:30
Not central though
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:19:44
Many altcoins dont want to replace bitcoin.. They just aspire to do something different.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:46:25
They upvoted u too
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:29:11
I believe that there is a possibility that 14k is going to be a local top for quite some time :D
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:10:03
Glad u asked did not answer this question even to myself..
I suppose that so called shitcoiners respect Bitcoin and then its a range of accepted "shitcoins" and everything after that is a "real shitcoin :p"
I learned something myself answering ur question
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:21:54
Is it time to buy alts yet?
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:14:19
Hey, Dont feed the trolls pls

@_date: 2019-07-10 18:26:05
Im in this game for aproc the same time.. I share the same thougts.
But i cant be sure for anything ;D
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:29:55
And still it has to be accepted by the nodes.. :D
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:21:53
This applies to bitcoin compared to the banking system my friend ;D
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:17:57

I myself forget the big picture sometimes cheers for ur reply.
Not everyone can be a miner but everyone can participate in the voting scheme which is the node implementation you chose to run on your pc
  
They could try to coerse the people then..
Anyhow its a step in the right direction.. This internet dialogue helped me set some things str8 cheers again
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:30:45
One of his movies show you a market of criminals that use their own tokens to communicate value and work for incentives provided by smart contracts.. Thats atleast what i got out of the second movie
@_date: 2019-11-08 02:19:12
Yes because you can do everything on bitcoin just like you can do anything in assembly and C
Edit: sarcastic.. assembly and C are programing languages
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:21:37
And bitcoin's smart contracts wont or you dont want Smart contracts in general?
@_date: 2019-11-08 02:22:47
I hope that one day people buy not for any ROI but simply because of a superior and safer asset. Bitcoin with no strings attached
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:53:05
No botcoin does not make you a bank... No goverment will bail you out be carefull people just know this
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:15:31
And keep a backup to just know that they did notnlose them
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:24:14
People trying to make fun of OP...
You dont even know his age or invested amount...
He might have nothing in stocks and very little in fiat but a value of a couple of hundred dollars in bitcoin.
He might also be young with not much to lose
Yall making assumptions about the OP..
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:25:39

It is very easy to prove that u are satoshi if u really are.. just sign a message e.g "I Craig at \[time and date\] just signed this message with satoshis key"
This guy is just noise.If u are satoshi sign with the keys or fuck off dont wanna spend any more time with ur shit
  
Where is the proof that makes u believe he is satoshi?
