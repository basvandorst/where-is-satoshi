No, it literally is impossible. Transactions are verified by a P2P network, so you can't just duplicate bitcoins because your phony transaction record won't be verified.

What clients or services would you recommend I use to purchase BTC? Mount Gox?

Why would somebody accept a transaction with 0 confirmations?

Alright, I want to jump on board the bitcoin train now.  How would I get started with opening an account?

That may true in the short term, but in the long term, the market has always grown as the economy naturally grows due to productivity increases/technological advances.  Since OP is 30, he can invest long term and not worry about short term market corrections.
That said, it would of course be better to buy in during a downward market correction.

Honestly, commodities like gold, gems, silver, etc., have very little objective value beyond their shininess and the ease of their use in decoration and jewelry.

So what? Just because the mafia exists and collects "protection money" for several generations doesn't mean that it's morally justified.  Actually, it only increases the magnitude of the moral crime.

This is such an absurd principle.  If someone else forces a system that I don't want upon me and spends my money to do it, it isn't my moral responsibility.  You can't justify control of others by saying that they failed to fight back.
