Ross Ulbricht tried to kill people. The family hiding Anne Frank did not. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:56:45
No. It's not. It is immoral to commit adultery. It is not however illegal. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:53:16
Pretty much. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:34:40


You do realize that BP's meddling didn't work, right? 
They control governments through bribery, extortion, violence, etc. They make them overthrow presidents, invade countries, or anything they need to happen.
No US president was overthrown by a corporation. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:23:21
It's called vigilantism. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 22:13:54


Nope. He was shot by a lunatic. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:21:51


Don't be so sure. 


And trying to murder six people. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:10:22


Entrapment is when the government makes you do something illegal. If Force broke into Ross Ulbricht's house, put a gun to Ross Ulbricht's head, and force him to hire a hitman that would be entrapment. Force did no such thing, Ross just decided to kill someone he suspected had stolen his funbux. That's not OK. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:23:14


Except the people he tried to murder. They'll probably be glad to see him go. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:33:27
Unless Force faked evidence, it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:19:37
The murder for hire was part of the charges. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:54:53


Nope. That was part of the enterprise. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:31:08


He also wanted one of the victims tortured. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 01:18:15


And trying to murder several people, which was part of the criminal gang charge. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:10:35


Of course, the darkies made an innocent white man try to commit mass murder. That's what happened. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:58:36
That was part of the criminal enterprise. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:26:30


No it doesn't, his crimes do not excuse Ulbricht's. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:33:50
They're allowed to do that in order to catch murderous psychopaths like Ross Ulbricht. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:33:05


They did not entrap Ulbricht. Nobody made him hire gangsters to torture someone to death. That was his choice. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:07:17


He didn't actually kill anyone. He couldn't get the death penalty. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:29:45


Nope. They were part of the conspiracy charge. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:02:48
Why? 
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:59:21


He was unsafely storing explosives in an apartment building. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:22:39
That was part of the criminal conspiracy charge. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 07:53:14


I doubt it. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:24:20
Ross, being a rich white boy with no sense of reality, forgot that there are millions of slaves in the world today. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:23:35
The state has a responsibility to protect its citizens. Psychos like Ulbricht need to be stopped. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:30:55


My neighbors don't have enough explosives to take my ass out by mistake. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:55:29


None of my neighbors, to my knowledge, have enough explosives next to their bed to blow my ass up. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:30:42


This idiot could have killed himself, postal employees, or his neighbors. Reckless endangerment is a crime for a reason. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:52:25
That doesn't matter. Ulbricht's criminality is not excused by the face that Force turned out to be a criminal himself. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:35:22


Probably not. 


I'd be an apologist if I were trying to justify Force's misdeeds. I am not. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:11:10
There's a lot of countries with slavery today. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:02:45


What "danger" am I in? 
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:10:08


The federal charges went first. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:10:48


Ross Ulbricht didn't. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:15:10
Yes, he was. They have the transcripts. He tried to have six people killed. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:26:37


He was hiring hitmen to murder people. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:10:44


How many are going to hire hitmen to kill people? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:07:41
You also would have thought Ross Ulbricht wasn't working in libraries and coffee shops. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:08:21
The FBI doesn't clock people with wrenches. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:06:15
Get real. The FBI doesn't kill white collar losers like Ulbricht. They send people like him to jail for long periods of time.
