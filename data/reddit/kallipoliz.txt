My argument was that it's way too volatile to be used as a currency. That's why users like steam dropped it. You compared it to gold which is also not a currency but a commodity.

Sounds like a bubble has formed

Why would I ever use this over dollars which costs nothing? I don’t see the advantage to bitcoin besides riding the pump.

It’s obviously not a currency but the top of the page says currency of the future. You guys seem divided on if it is or isn’t and the rest have no clue other than it’s going to go up to the moon.

It's way too volatile to be a store of value. It's a speculative asset.

lmfao what a thought out reply.

You should keep up on the news with your investments.

I can't even buy steam games with bitcoin.... currencies can't be volatile

For real.
When I buy something only with USD there are no fees and it's near instant. 
When I put my money in the bank I know that tomorrow it will still be the same amount and that in 5 years 10 years 20 years it will still have value.
When I go to the store and buying goods the prince doesn't change by the time I get to the cash register.

Outsider as well but interested in the subject. I agree with you like I would like to see this be successful but I'm afraid the recent success might be self-defeating.

That's the point though. They dropped it because it was too annoying of a currency. Can I walk into MC'ds with some gold and buy a big mac? No? Well, it's a shit currency then.

The difference between then and now is my grandparents didn’t know what bitcoin was then. Getting a wave of people throwing their money into something they don’t understand only happens once. There was only one big tech bubble.

They will go to less risky assets like bonds not bitcoin
