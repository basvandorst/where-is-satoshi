Invest what you can afford to lose, great advice in investments as always 500 bits

Great incentive! I will support you. 
Here is an indication of what kind of bandwidth a well connected node (average of 84 nodes connected) uses on a daily basis:

No question is a stupid question. 
But no, currently it is not possible to earn BTC with doing this.

1000 bits Thanks for helping build the infrastructure

The blockchain is indeed inside the appdata folder. To find out what's using so much space I'd recommend using windirstat.

And now you got more than one Bitcoin! 500 bits

Depending on your OS, you can limit the speed which bitcoind uses.
For windows you can use [NetLimiter](
For Linux I would recommend [using the build in TC](
Please bear in mind that this node was run 24/7 and did not lose connection over a significant amount of time. If you reboot your bitcoind node it will take some while before bandwidth usage starts picking up again

Seems SEPA transfers are working fine, just a little bit slower than normal due to the increase in cash flow.
I do not know about other international transfers

Please note that these chips STILL need to be assembled! Please dont just dive in to this project but read up on it first.
It is however, a very cool project

Excellent post! I was searching for software which did this kind of thing for days now.
I will and try to get this working in the next couple of weeks.
I'll gather some people which can help me out for setting up the infrastructure we'll be needing, including verification processing etc.
I've got several years experience in programming/developing high-scaleable   so it might be worth a shot.
Before you all shoot down the idea: I own my own company, which resides in the Netherlands, thus getting necessary -valid- paperwork, contracts and other necessities should't be that hard.
If anyone has any tips/suggestions to take into account please tell, as this will make the platform better.

hopefully in a few days I got some setup which works and you can tag me as "owns a btc exchange"
