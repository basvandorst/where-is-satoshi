Is that means that is not safe yet to import the private key into a BCC wallet?

I have an account with Huobi, and i can see my BCC there, but still can not trade
 with it... so i guess it will happen soon (if kraken supporting it)

Sorry, but I have another question for you; I will appreciate if you can explain or tell me where to look for the answer …. If I sent my BTC from one wallet to a new one (in block no’ 478564) are my BTC that now in the new wallet separated from the BCC chain? Or sould I do it only after the BCC/BCH will mine a block? And is it safe to import my old wallet private key into the BCC wallet?

So what is your suggestion, why not sell now, and buy again in day or two( before August 1) ?

Archaeal, thanks for your respond. But let me explain you how it looks like from a new person dealing with it...
Yes,I generated that address offline, and holding it on a USB , then I sent my BTC to that address. So far all good(I checked on blockchin.info, and could see it's all good) 
... then I just tried to see how can I use the BTC there, and I imported my privet key to blockchin wallet... from there I can send my BTC anywhere I want... but after sending BTC from the blockchin wallet I realized... my private key is already exposed ( fro example if I need to send some BTC elsewhere, I'm just signing in to blockchin wallet, and just send it... no additional requirement needed) at that point I freaked out.... generating a new address via bitaddres.org sent my BTC to the new address thinking that now, it's more safe for a long term saving, am I completely misunderstood?
