Good news I guess. I left about $150 I'm BTC on Coinbase during the fork. That's about $20 in BCH value currently and probably $0.20 come 2018.

Sell under the table.

Sure is a latte money...
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:01:38
I look forward to the upcoming BTC sale.

Okay good. I was beginning to think something was wrong. New to the game.
I'm at 15 after almost 19 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:49:51
The problem is that I feel like I spend more time waiting than I do buying.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:04:13
Were you expecting $785? If not, then yes. It's a scam. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:29:31
You can. I'll be more than happy to accept a donation in bitcoin from you.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:50:53
I tried that. The result is that you never buy because you're always waiting for it to go lower.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:20:44
You could be right, but I would only wait a max of a few days before making that decision.
The price you see now could be your dream purchase price in the next three years and laughable in five.

In the address bar.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:11:56
This is incorrect. The reason it's going down like this is because I bought in at $4627 an hour before the drop.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:45:18
That would be nice. I'd love to buy at that price.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:16:55
This is depressing because it shows me how much money I could've had if I actually followed through with my plan to put $20 a month towards Bitcoin starting in 2013.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:29:56
It's enough money.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:10:09
So, cheap coins until the news blows over? Sounds good to me.
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:36:20


I've had way too many "it'll nevers" come back and bite me in the ass. Go for it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:08:01
This is a thing? ... I'll be right back...
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:10:28
I was waiting for it to go to $1600 before I bought back in at that time. Next thing I know, it's $2500. Sucks for me.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:54:18
I missed the last $1800 sale. I'll be waiting. I'll probably see it hit $1900 and then skyrocket back to $3000. Leaving me like who did it and ran.
