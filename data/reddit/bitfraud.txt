What's the main hindrance?
People have to bid up artificially scarce units in order to get them. How does that make sense?

Maybe you should have kept that to yourself. Now Bitfinex will get a flood of degenerates requesting refunds.

A transaction costs roughly $5-8 currently and is 99% subsidized by the miner reward. This deranged subreddit wants a distributed network that someone else is suppose to pay for.

So under the "VC" era we've had apparent billions in investment and the result is what exactly?
Bitcoin remains more difficult to get in 2015 than a few years ago when Bitinstant was in operation. 
The price has gone nowhere but down during the entire VC era. 
Let's start talking reality here.

I thought we are suppose to throw penny shavings at each other.

Adress what I said not your own delusions. It's time to say that venture capital has been a disaster for this space producing nothing but highly restricted exchange services.

The norm in this ecosystem for a failing business is to first rob yourself and than claim to be hacked. We've seen this pattern over and over again.

Satoshi original vision for bitcoin is long dead. Anyone remember 1 CPU 1 Vote? Now it's 1 guy owning 1000 garbage ASICs.

Prices measured in bitcoin have increased by 200% over the last 12 months.
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:29:39
Yea it's easy if you already have bitcoin. Getting bitcoin is the huge hassle. So the barrier is massive, hence no mass adoption. When will this subreddit understand this concept?
@_date: 2015-09-10 21:09:30
Is the word bitcoin being eliminated from peoples vocabulary?

Finney was the first user to recognize the pump and dump nature of bitcoin when he listed the payout potential. Hal Finney's messages with Satoshi prove that bitcoin was setup as a get rich quick scheme from the get go.

Bitcoin lost 30% of it's value in August during major economic turmoil so your claims are bogus.
Can you name a government currency that erased 1/3rd of it's purchasing power in the same time frame?

Bitcoin taxes bagholders.

Counting wallets is like counting website clicks during the dotcom era.
Counting transaction value is irrelevant because if I have 1000 BTC in an adress and send someone 1 BTC, it counts that I sent all 1000 even though 999 are returned to me. So $230k is counted as being sent even though I only sent $230. 
There is no way $50million a day of BTC is being transacted when major exchanges do not even have a few million on their order books.

So far nearly every single bitcoin company has been a scam. There is not one entity in this toxic ecosystem that is not without a lengthy list of problems.
Banks are being cautious because of the unsavory reputation projected by this space. Let's call a spade a spade. This community is the very definition of moral degeneracy.

Bitcoin ATM's have been a total failure world wide. Why is the Bern location any different?
Last year this subreddit promised us that the entire world would be awash in Bitcoin Atms. Today most have been exposed as scams.

By their own admission, Bitpay requires a perpetually rising price in order to stay in business. They sell into rallies to pay for expenses. A really risky business model.

Beware of bitcoiners bearing gifts.

Let the invisible hand sort it out.

You wanted to engage in usury and ended up losing.

Bitcoin lost 1/3rd of it's value in the month of August alone.

This subreddit was actively defending Karpeles as a victim right up until the end.

Why is nobody talking about the near stagnant userbase?

Respectable like a gambling kingpin?

If my local economy collapses why would I go and trade goods I need to survive for useless bitcoins? Bitcoin requires a sophisticated economy in order to work. Look at where bitcoin has been adopted and it's all first world rich societies.
@_date: 2015-09-14 11:42:22
It's an impossibility because of the artificial scarcity of bitcoin. Hoarded coins prevent large scale adoption from occurring.

How is Gavin considered an expert when he has a long list of never-ending blunders?
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:58:45
Is this the clever story part? Long ramble with no answer to the statement I made.
@_date: 2015-09-07 10:36:57
Tell me what are they suppose to do with the bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:33:12
Yes. It is a sophisticated wealth transfer scheme cloaked with a clever back story.

Yea after I hand all my info over to shady startups that exist one day and are gone the next.
Bitcoin was *easier* to obtain 4 years ago. That is fact. You could walk into any Walmart and have bitcoins on your cellphone before you got back to your car.
There aren't 100k merchants accepting Bitcoin, they are accepting dollars through Bitpay. When Bitpay closes down that "merchant adoption" will evaporate as well. 
I am observing what is going on. The price has declined 80% from a pump and dump. Bitcoin has no use cases outside of illegal activities. None of the promises touted by this subreddit have materialized. Censorship is the defacto norm here as the ecosystem continues falling apart.
