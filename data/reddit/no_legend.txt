No, the best way to buy bitcoin is as much as you can afford at the lowest possible price.

No, when bitcoin falls in price the purchasing power of the dollar and most other fiat currencies don’t also go down.

You will regret selling it in 1 year.

The general consensus on volatility is that as time moves on, bitcoin will become more stable and less volatile. My question is, will we see a bitcoin that offers a ROI compatible to what we see in an index fund approx 7% year over year, incentivizing individuals to save money in bitcoin, or will it be a stable asset similar to Gold where it maintains essentially the same purchasing power over time?

As a method of payment, yes, but as a long term store of value, it seems much better than a savings account.

But bitcoin is a deflationary asset.  Even more so than gold, so it makes no sense to spend it. It even incentives lending and benefits the debt holders since what you get paid back to you will be worth more than when you lent it. If you borrow or spend it, you will be in a much worse position than if you had just held onto it and not borrowed.

In the short term, sure.
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:56:28
Why would you spend something that will only go up in value drastically?
@_date: 2019-04-21 00:55:57
No they're not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:02:23
Seems like a waste to me, bitcoin is a great store of value, but not a great currency.

Why would you pay for something using a deflationary currency?  The bitcoin you paid for rent or groceries in 2011 is worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars today.

9K is a big milestone.  Probably a lot of profit taking and breaking even at that price.  Almost 3x your money if you bought at the 2018 low, which wasn't that long ago. We will retest today. If not, very soon.

Probably 2-3 more bubbles. Each increasing adoption further.

Its return is still much larger than any savings account, and better than an index fund. I don’t know why anyone would use a savings account at this point.

No.  Unless you're buying or selling, where you store your coins has no effect on price.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:32:30
Why not?

Bitcoin can still replace banks and disrupt the system without ever being fully adopted as a currency. It just needs to be easy to exchange for local currency.
