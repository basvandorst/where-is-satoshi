Realization is when you liquidate or exchange the asset for goods or services. Since the asset value is being exchanged for value in another asset, it's just a like-kind exchange and not a taxable recognition.
If you bought in at $1k and now BCC and BTC are worth $2k, and you have 1 of each after the split, then your basis would still only be $1k and you'd pay $3k liquidation to fiat or if you paid for goods or services with a fair market value of $4k then you'd still pay short or long term cap gains of $3k.
The split will also be long term cap gains if you've held the base asset for &gt; 1 yr.

It is probably taxed the same way as M&amp;A arbitrage. You'll pay cap gains on subordinated assets, so the full $2300, but a basis of $300 will be applied to the new asset (BCC).
Unsold BTC will of course keep the same basis as before ($1,000).

I have a question.
Basically, we have 2.5 days for nodes to signal BIP-91, afterwhich they will begin rejecting non segwit blocks, assuming BIP91 stays above 51% signal.
Where do the economic incentives line up? Miners are primarily measuring ROI on BTC yield to a fiat currency (for the time being). Miners are running a business, and are commercial operations.
Given that consideration and the fact that many of these pools rely on asicboost, - wouldn't the economic incentive lie on reneging on segwit?
Or does the economic effect of reneging and the likelihood of a chain split disincentivize them from reneging?
I guess, from the miners perspective does P% * (loss of ROI from asicboost) &lt; P2% * (loss in BTC/fiat rate from chain split)? Or not...
Pardon the ignorance in advance.
