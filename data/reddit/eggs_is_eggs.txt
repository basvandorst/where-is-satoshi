Experts say that bitcoin will hit $10000000000k by next week. Buy y'all!
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:24:06
So if you are never selling then what's the point of owning bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:36:44
It's called opportunity cost.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:32:55
They were probably saying the same thing about you when you were bragging about how you made tons of money by buying fake money and HODLing.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:07:08
Of course. That's the natural growth of bitcoin. It's supposed to moon and make us all rich quick. So the quicker, the better.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:35:11
HODLer tears are a deflationary currency so they should go to the MOON by 2022. I predict $100k/oz.

I would invest in a pubic hair based currency.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:20:26
No, to bottle up the tears of HODLers and sell them. The lower that BTC goes, the more tears they produce. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:08:53

How is bitcoin going to be the money of the people if rich people like the Winklevoss Twins and the Big Banks are so involved? Doesn't seem like it will ever happen.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:59:47
Why do people say this? Hardly anyone bought before the bubble. That's why there was a bubble because everyone started buying at that time. Far more wealth has been destroyed by bitcoin than gained because people bought high and either sold lower or are currently bag holding.

@_date: 2018-06-29 19:51:16
It's a buy below $500
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:09:28
Don't worry that bitcoin is this low. They can just do more forks. Bitcoin Gold, bitcoin silver, bitcoin platinum, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin kryptonite, bitcoin yourmom. There are an infinite number of bitcoins they can make so it's all good. 
$5k bitcoin * 4 versions of it = $20k, so it's back to an ALL TIME HIGH. Yea baby!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:04:10

It's not free. You pay fees to the miners to process your transactions. Remember when fees were &gt;$50 per transaction?

But what about the people who bought at 20k in every other country?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:04:15
HODL is a scam spread by the traders to get the sheeple to not sell their bitcoins so that the traders and whales can make all the money.

Nope just keep HODLing. I mean if it's a popular meme on the internet, it can't be wrong!
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:07:29
if you're not memeing then you're doing it wrong. it's like tinkerbell in peter pan, if you believe enough and meme enough it will go up. people just haven't been memeing enough and that's why it's at $8k.

@_date: 2018-03-09 00:57:07
Here's my prediction: $6k by march, then 9k in september, then for the next 18 months it will be in a holding pattern between $10-12k, in August of 2019 it will form another bubble and go to $35k, crash back to $5k in the next 3 months and then go to the MOON after that starting in December of 2021, topping out at $85k by March 14, 2025.
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:09:56
Maybe it will drop to 1 cent? The bounce will be really huge. Maybe to $1 billion?

Only 11 more months until Chinese new year 2019! Just keep HODLing boys!!!
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:34:53
I predict a long term bear market for bitcoin. No new money is coming in after the bubble has burst and bitcoin still has little practical value as currency due to high fees and slow transactions. Plus, there are more and better alt coins every day. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:57:10
So the inflation rate of bitcoin will go down, but it will still be an inflationary currency.

Yeah like 20 btc can buy you a lambo. Check with your local dealer.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:58:57
Just stay in the bitcoin bubble and you'll hear that bitcoin and blockchain will change the world and never go outside that bubble.

Isn't the breakeven mark for profitability for miners at ~$5k? What happens if it goes below that? Will some stop mining? Mine and hodl?

Hey guys have you ever seen that episode of Dragon Ball Z and Goku's power level is really high and Vegeta measures it and he says "it's over 9000" and then Nappa says "what that's impossible?"
It's a really cool episode and reminds me of what is currently going on with the price of bitcoin. Of course the price does fluctuate and so it may go above or below 9000 again at any time but for the time being the price of bitcoin is similar to the situation of that episode of Dragon Ball Z.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:03:59
No he's implying that he will only buy when it goes up, thus the time-tested buy high, sell low strategy which is guaranteed to make lots of profits.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:18:26
20k soon
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:49:35
I just bought a lambo with all my profits. Thanks for the pump guys!
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:00:22
Warren Buffet also said that the crypto bubble will end in tears.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:40:24
WRONG. Bitcoin is supposed to be a get rich quick scheme. If I'm not getting rich quickly then what's the point? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:18:24
1 bitcoin is still 1 bitcoin. Fiat currency is worthless so who cares how much it's worth in USD.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:25:24
Today has been a great day for all the USD hodlers out there. It's up vs. stocks, up vs crypto, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:15:22
NOBODY = 35 people
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:46:33
yeah but even with the subsidized electricity i heard the breakeven price was ~$5k
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:44:46
thank you. someone gets it. there is a grand CONSPIRACY against bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:15:51
It's going to change the world dude. HODLGANG
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:19:32
We did it boys! Back to the moon now!
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:13:02
An industrial conglomerate in China will go bankrupt which will trigger a domino effect of bad debts and business failures across the world. All that money will plow into cryptos until that bubble bursts.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:09:34
It's a conspiracy by the globalist, banker cuck new world order people. Just HODL and it'll go back up.
@_date: 2018-07-11 17:01:24
My mom predicts that it will go up to $1.5 million within the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:24:18
just HODL and meme it up. It's like Tinkerbell from the Peter Pan play. If everyone just believes hard enough, it'll go back up to $20k
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:50:18
HODL. never sell
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:03:28
So what about all the "expert" predictions that bitcoin will go to $25k or $60k this year?
Anyway the idea that "the experts are all wrong" is the idiocy that gave us Donald Trump as president. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:10:13
This just in: People who stand to profit by the value of bitcoin going up predict that the value of bitcoin will go up.
@_date: 2018-07-08 10:40:58
30,000 yen is about $270, not $1k. The previous limit was 10,000 yen (~$90).
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:11:33
It could get much better than this.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:27:51
Let's abolish the banks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Money is safer in crypto!!
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:19:55
Bitcoin is not a real currency until the price going down is beneficial for some people. Right now everyone is rooting for the price to go up...so they can sell it to the greater fool. But with a real currency, prices changes benefit people both ways because people actually use it for transactions. It's still nothing more than a speculative beanie baby or baseball card.
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:05:31
Why would you keep HODLing a depreciating asset? Sell and put it in equities or bonds or something that will appreciate in value.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:47:56
So they're all just middlemen sucking value and efficiency out of the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:55:05
So which meme is going to make my magic internet money go up again? HODL isn't working, talking about lambos and to the moon isn't working, and neither is complaining about FUD and Chinese new Year. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:19:08
...or they're trying to create demand (aka PUMP) and profit from it (aka DUMP). 
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:05:24
Bitcoin is created out of thin air. And you can fork it infinite times and create an infinite number of other cryptos because it's open source. Where is the value in that?
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:35:03
I'll stick with the game of banking. I didn't lose 75% of the value of my money in the last 6 months. And I can spend the money in my bank at any retailer. And my bank wasn't hacked and my money wasn't stolen. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:22:42
That's the worst reason to hold. Sell and put that money into something that will make you money.
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:07:03
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:24:26
Cool story bro
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:10:09
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:09:06
Now we know who's making money in bitcoin: the exchanges
It's like when I used to play poker. Regardless of who wins or loses, the casino always makes a profit off of the rake (the fees that poker players pay).
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:51:44
Get rekt Winkle-douche twins. Zuckerberg 4ever!!!
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:56:06
So it's an electronic beanie baby.
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:56:28
I'm going all in on Bitcoin. $100k in 2021 guaranteed!
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:57:53
This guy and Tom Lee are the biggest jokes in the finance community.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:56:55
Anything that will perform better than your current investment.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:10:49
People speculate because other people speculate.
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:41:55

@_date: 2018-12-22 04:00:09
We did it boys! GGWP
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:45:24
zomg you got me. I am an employee of Goldman Sachs who is trying to spread FUD on sites like reddit, youtube, pornhub, etc. to drive down the price so we can buy them on the cheap before the price moons. GGWP
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:27:45
It's true tho. 1 doge is still 1 doge.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:32:36
Exactly. This is 100% confirmed a recovery. Gonna hit a new ATH in 2019.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:39:43
Hey cuz how you doing? I'm also related to mark twain. Not kidding either. See you at the next family reunion.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:30:50
No the true bottom is after tax refunds.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:09:18
Yeah I agree. I touched the market and the texture of it told me that we hit the bottom at 3200. That's how much it FELT like the bottom. And when I say "felt like the bottom" I mean it mathematically, epistologically was the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:25:57
we did it boys. the power of your memes made it go up 5%. gg nocoiners
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:06:46
we're back baby!
HODL HODL HODHL DOHOD HLD
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:31:32
Please tag me after he tags you in one of his posts. I love people making fun of the delusion.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:36:02
Why does he want free crypto to be taxed? Free is free. Don't tax free things.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:08:49
Get your tin foil hats ready...it's a CONSPIRACY
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:12:35
EZ game. sell at 3.6k, buy at 3.2k, print money, repeat
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:45:26
I knew it was a good idea to buy at $3.2k
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:39:43
I think bitcoin was worse than all of those.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:24:36
hodl boys we gonna get through this
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:44:10
I ignored it when it hit $20k. :(
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:06:51
Let's get the pump going boyssss!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:44:05
HODL boys we still at the top.
Nothing stops this train.
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:31:56

@_date: 2018-12-24 21:24:42
BUY NOW
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:41:55
LOL you had a bad day today? That's a lot of negativity in one post.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:09:41
Don't get greedy
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:49:15
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:13:16
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:15:02
No I'm saying I physically touched the market. I assume when you said "felt" you meant in a metaphorical sense? I meant in a literal sense. 
And you are correct that it's the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:45:01
KEEP IT UP BOYS
up almost 20% in 2 days. 
gg nocoiners
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:29:27
Yeah bitcoin would be at $50k if it weren't for FUD like this. We see through your tricks, OP.
Just HODL
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:09:38

@_date: 2018-12-24 22:39:16
I'm a member of the 1,000,000,000,000,000 club because I own 1 satoshi.
