I have bought all my drugs in USD. Completely untraceable. 
 Guess how much i spent on drugs and alcohol last year? Well it isn't on a public ledger so you won't fucking know.

Bitcoin still works regardless of the price.

The price is down yeah, but the technology that is bitcoin still works.

You should just buy bitcoin instead. No worrying about setting up equipment,  no electrical costs, no questioning whether the company will ship your miner(s) in a timely enough fashion to make the ROI.

I bought my first 50$ of btc right before Mt. Gox went under. It was frustrating watching my btc lose value while stuck in ACH bank transfer limbo. However i believe in the blockchain tech that is bitcoin, and there will be good times in the future.
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:10:39
Any proof? What was the address you deleted the keys to?

Yes despite millions being invested by VC companies, bitcoin is dead.
Lol glad your shorts are doing well
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:17:54
Hey congrats on learning about bitcoin and it's uses. Just remember don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and use strong passwords, enable 2FA, make sure you run virus/malware scans frequently, and also, Enable 2FA and strong passwords at the very least.
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:19:27

I had 1.5 btc worth about a month ago, sold for dental bills, now i have about 0.49 as of now. These cheap bits are a steal.

Congrats! Please take time to read up on btc when you can, but be sure to enable 2fa on any accounts, make sure you backup private keys you control + encryption, and enjoy the ride my friend. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:53:29
It's amazing that I can literally see all this happening in realtime. Good work, I will be donating some BTC here soon

I seem to be having an issue with looking up the "Hash details", when you show the TX hash. It pulls up an "illegal character : at 5 error dialog whenever i pull up the "hash" link. Address link work fine though.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:45:07
I wouldn't recommend maxing your cards to put into bitcoin, but regardless, make sure to enable 2 factor authorization on all your accounts, and back up any wallet addresses you have. make backups, and use strong passwords.
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:42:07
That makes the rest of the bitcoins more scarce.

Throwback from when exactly?
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:47:55
Your grandpa should research more into bitcoin if he want's to buy 100k's worth but doesn't know where to get it.
does your grandpa know about bitcoin security, wallet encryption, BIP38 encryption, offline wallets, etc? if he doesn't then it is certainly not a good idea whatsoever. It would suck major balls to get 100k worth of coin just to have it stolen by some malware or virus on the regular home pc.
