Unlike with gold or actual paper currency, bitcoin is infinitely divisible and still practical for trade.
There will always be enough to go around.

The main use of a money is as a store of value, its use as a medium of exchange is secondary. 
This isn't a dilemma, if you believe Bitcoin would hold its value longer then you're better off spending the dollars.

Perhaps I wasn't clear, but this point sums up my view "...criticizes 'human rightism' approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law..."
"Skewed" implies no intentionality only causality, the intentions of free healthcare and the effects diverge.


In your opinion, a footballer's contribution to society is greater than a teachers, I simply pointed out that society disagrees. How much it disagrees is a function of the difference between a footballer's income and teacher's income.

I agree with you, its not always better to rent but it is less risky.
Imagine you start off with enough money to buy a house. You could buy a house right now and spend all your capital or you could rent a house and spend a smaller amount every month investing the rest of the money. Now how would you choose?
If you believe the house you're buying will appreciate faster than the amount you invest (say in bitcoins) apart from the amount you spend in rent you're better off buying the house. On the other hand if the investment does better than the house (again less the rent) you'd be better off renting.
You also have to consider time value, money tomorrow is worth less than money today. In order to see just how much you're spending you need to discount all future rents to today (net present value). 
There are times when buying a house is a great investment, but just like any other investment its risky and requires an understanding of the people in the area, potential future development, laws and how they'll change apart from the engineering of the house itself.
Houses are also illiquid, you can't sell part of a house, and need maintenance since they deteriorate over time. It's also difficult to hedge your bets and difficult to buy 2 half houses.
The other issue is the time scale of the investment, you're not making a 2 or 5 year bet but a 10-20 year one. The further out it is, the harder it is to predict.
These are some of the reasons I prefer renting to buying.
On the getting old argument, if the choice is between having a house and no other investments or not having any investments, then yes, having the house is better. Nowhere near the best but better.

"Banksters" are compensated in a market heavily skewed against savers (inflation, wealth tax) and funded by a central bank.
To put that into perspective, what services would a bitcoin bank offer? How would it earn a profit?
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:56:37
The real issue is maturity transformation, if you lend money to the bank for time T, you shouldn't be able to pull it out before that. The fact that you can necessitates a lender of last resort.
[moldbug]( has a great explanation.

The only reason to take a loan is if you feel you could generate more value than the time value of the money you borrow.
I could imagine buying an inefficient factory or a piece of arable land land. I can't see the benefits of buying a house.

How would you measure higher societal value? What you believe is just and fair? Society chooses to pay footballers and not teachers.
Taxes and subsidies are forced redistribution by definition, neither is voluntary, and modifying incentives will change the way people interact i.e. skewed markets.
"Basic human rights" are laws chosen by a society and shouldn't be scrutinised by a separate set of ethics. (i.e. not just the fuzzies) and are very much a political issue.

What Peter doesn't get is that Bitcoin, like gold, is it's own counterparty. If you own bitcoin, you own it irrevocably unless you choose to give it to someone else.
Any centralised currency, whatever it is "backed" by will need more trust to hold it than just holding bitcoin.
Combine that with the fact that it is globally accessible, globally transferrable, and incredibly low cost to keep secure and you've got something which disrupts 5000 years of financial history.

You speak as if a separate entity got genetically lucky? Wouldn't that entity just not exist. Its not like a roulette wheel where you happen to land on the good looking rich square before you're born.

As I said long bets, but wow, landlord's mortgages! That is one crazy amount of debt.

Its time value actually, the hardware companies want their doughnuts (goods) now while the miners don't mind more doughnut over time.
The "correct" price of a mining rig is the NPV (net present value) of all bitcoins mined discounted to today. If it's lower than the cost of the mining rig its not worth it.

But you also take the risk that the housing market will stay that way (or improve), if the rents fall you're stuck with paying the same mortgage either way. Or what if you want to leave the city, thats a lot harder with a mortgage to pay off.
Even worse is if interest rates rise and your mortgage payments rise with them. You end up with a lot of debt you can't pay off because the price of your house hasn't changed.

Mencius Moldbug's theory of money (BTM) is the best I've heard. He's bearish on bitcoin but not for any technical reasons.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:00:43
It doesn't concern me, bitcoin's future price will depend on its use as a store of value, and whether its current price is driven by public opinion is irrelevant.
Sure Richard Branson is using it as an advertisement as are some of the merchants who recently began accepting it. But why does that matter?

Bitcoin mining isn't artificial employment or work for the sake of work. Miners provide a service, auditing transactions, for which they are compensated. Transaction fees are not largess.
Keynes recommended employing people to perform tasks no one required, funded by the state. His goal was charity under the guise of employment.
@_date: 2013-11-02 12:21:54
But why would they, or even why should they? Houses are illiquid and low revenue generating assets. 
Imo, people buy houses because they are a government subsidised store of value and in some countries the only option.
@_date: 2013-10-13 02:38:14
Moldbug's bubble theory of money seems to explain it the best 
@_date: 2013-09-27 08:43:12
Perhaps, but is this what the stakeholders signed up for? Maturity transformation is the real problem 
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:29:47
I apologise, perhaps Keynes did have the best intentions in mind while proposing his theories.
The effects are a whole different matter. Income is an measure of value provided to society, all income is fuelled by someone else's need. By forcefully redistributing income you skew the market, sending the wrong signal to producers and consumers.
Tie that up with a political motive (votes for stuff) and you have a recipe for exploitation. Low interest rates, subsidies, healthcare, this is charity. I'm all for helping my fellow man but calling it better for the economy is horribly misleading
