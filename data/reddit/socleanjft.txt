I have been tinkering around with TAILS recently but the problem would lie in the electrum wallet being a 3rd party. If they have your private key, even if the program itself is offline, wouldn't they still have your information stored on their servers? I feel like that would be an amazing way to do BTC transactions as you would have a different IP and spoofed MAC every time. What have you found in your research?

I would say buy a better card and mine a different coin. Ive read about companies making mining-dedicated graphics cards. 
Probably something you could look into. My question is this, if I am a miner, can I charge my own rate to process my own transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:55:24
Yes. Or paper wallet

Go to blockchain.info (I don't trust links and neither should you!) type in your wallet ID in the search bar. This will show you all of your transactions and your wallet balance. 
You may need to do this from a computer and not a phone.

If it's an invalid address, the transaction won't complete. Check the Blockchain info for your wallet and try to view the transaction. If it goes through, which wouldn't make much sense due to the unlikelihood of a wallet address being THAT close to your intended address, then you're screwed. Check the Blockchain

Holy shit! I did not know that! Another reason to love TAILS.

Thanks everyone! I appreciate it!

Yes. I went from coinbase to paper and when and if I decide to sell I can do so from electrum or coinbase. I can do this by implementing a sweep in electrum or recieve in coinbase. 
To answer your question, yes, either way you will incur a miner's fee. Anytime you send, receive, spend, or transfer your precious bitties there will be a fee. Same applies for ETC and LTC. 
The whole "People running nodes and setting their fees" is above my head and a question better answered by those above my pay grade. Good luck!

TLDR on how to do this?
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:33:48
The objection I've seen is that USBs are notoriously unpredictable in relation to their reliability. 
A concern I had was that a piece of spyware could lay dormant and be triggered by the recognition of a USB device being inserted. 
I went the paper wallet route because I got sick of worrying about a coinsplit, which third party apps agree with BIP 148, spyware, etc. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:40:47
I have my private keys on a paper wallet. Completely offline. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:21:41
So, transferring coins to the hardware wallet, how does that protect the coins from the split? I honestly do not understand segwit, BIP, or the split in general. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:34:29
I also use coinbase and I've never waited more than an hour for my purchases to go through. I just hate the weekly limit thing despite the amount of personal information they have of mine. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 10:42:19
The only qualm I have with them was the lag on the buy/sell. For some reason if, let's say, BullshitcoinX was at .00045 and you manually type that price in, you may miss the window for that price even though the ticker still reflects it. 
The servers are overloaded and it's annoying but not malicious. In my experience, there is lag on all the tabs and any website function during crucial periods of price fluctuation. This is an indication, at least to me, that their security/servers NEED to be upgraded. 
Other than that, I've had no problems. Deposits and withdrawals always went through in a timely manner, the auto buy/sell function essentially bypasses the formerly mentioned problem (manually typing in price and dealing with server side lag), and the UI is relatively easy to navigate for a novice. 
Hope this helps!

How do you achieve "a)"? I have my coin in a cold wallet and I thought I could just spend coins using the "spend" side of the wallet. Did I miss something?
 I realize this post sounds like I'm being a smart-ass. I'm not. I'm genuinely frustrated/curious because every time I think I understand this shit, there's another boundary.

Thank you! I just assumed that I made some fatal error and my bitties were at risk. I appreciate you taking the time to explain!

1. How the hell do I get my private keys from Multibit HD? 
2. Does multibit or coinbase support segwit and BIP148? 
3. As I understand it, if a company supports the August 1 BIP, there will be two types of coins, 1 BIP and 1 Legacy. 
A. Is this (BIP making seemingly drastic changes) a regular thing to occur in the bitcoin world? 
B. Is this not a huge red flag indicator of extreme volatility? 
C. If I was a hodler who didn't keep up with the latest news and trends in bitcoin (only checking my account once a month or so) how would I know what to do when BIPs happen?

I doubt it would be a tax deductible donation. Trade coin in for cash and donate the cash, I'm sure they could actually use that. 
Maybe I'm paranoid, but you could always pull a member of the 501(c)(3) aside, explain bitcoin, put the coin on a paper wallet, and hand them the paper wallet. 
Unfortunately, the coin would be useless if they can't use it to pay for anything for the charity. The 990 form has a place for gifts and investments. The non-profit would need to talk to an attorney or an accountant about the ins and outs of where and how bitcoin fits in there. 
Cash, regardless of worth, is easy to count. Bitcoin, while I love it, would be a big pain in the ass come 990 time.
Edit: Grammar 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:03:45
I'm no accountant, but I don't think the 1099 is the form you'd need to worry about. Unless you've somehow incorporated independent contracting into your day trading.

Ahhh gotcha. Yea that's one thing I have yet to fully understand. How does something that is online have any impact on something offline? E.g. Cold storage spending. Wouldn't that involve a 3rd party having some control over my keys and ultimately defeat the paper wallet's entire purpose?
