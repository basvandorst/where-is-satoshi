No, I get that, I didn't take it as an attack. 


Pretty accurate. One of the founders was the son in law of Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of apartheid. One of the reasons they selected Orania to establish themselves rather than a more salubrious part of the country, was because they figured no-one else would want it. And so, they'd be left alone.

It's a strange community to be sure. I've visited several times. But they aren't militant - more Amish than David Koresh. I'd be interested to see how their digital currency fairs. The economist Dawie Roodt is one of the best minds in the field here, and he's preparing a thesis on Orania's experiment.

There's a group of businesses - hotels mostly - in Zanzibar that will begin accepting bitcoin. They held a conference on this subject about a month ago. Africa is ideal for cryptocurrency. Great mobile phone platforms and crappy formal banking with high fees. We're screaming for an alternative.

There are dealers in the country, and at least two trading platforms - BitMari, and Golix.io. Plus Whatsapp forums etc. So a vibrant Bitcoin community, although small.

Thanks for the explainer, it lays it out perfectly. Yes, the spread represents the risk. It doesn't matter how much US dollars you have in your account, the money can't be moved or withdrawn. Because Zimbabwe cannot print US dollars. They depend entirely on imported money. And since no-one is investing and the country's exports are falling, dollar supply is in acute shortage.

Zimbabwe uses the US dollar as their currency. The Zimbabwe dollar was dropped around 6-7 years ago. The US dollar is now their fiat currency.
