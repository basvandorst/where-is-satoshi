I would say the only difference would be limits.  I have been verifed on Circle and Coinbase for a little over a year now and i have a 10k DAILY buy/sell limit on Coinbase while on Circle I have a 3k WEEKLY limit.  
I have tried increasing my Circle limit and they wont allow it.  I could up my Coinbase limits even more but i dont feel like the extra verification and im not hitting my limit on there

Yea driver license works as a form of id for banks.  Also only some banks require ID for cash deposits

You can look up the transaction by searching your address on a block explorer like blockchain.info or blocktrail.com

Thats not good if the trade has been canceled.  It sounds like he all ready opened a dispute.  Did you upload pictures of the reciept?  Thats all you need to do to win the dispute.   Show evidence that the payment was made to the correct account and your golden
Contact the seller in the morning and see if he pays you.  If not submit a support ticket to localbitoins staff explaining the situation with pictures

Im a vendor on lbc and here are my thoughts.  It sounds like the seller your dealing with is a little paranoid.    Make sure you mark payment complete.  As long as you have done that the only way for the seller to cancel the trade is through a moderator dispute which can take up to 24 hours.
For tonight you have 2 options.  You can either wait until the morning and either receive the bitcoin or open a dispute if he dosent.  You could also open the dispute tonight but it will prob take up to 24 hours for it to settle so you wont be receiving the bitcoin any faster.   If it was me and the seller had a good rep I would probably just wait until the morning and leave negative feedback after the fact.  gl op

All banks have a slightly different cash deposit process but thier all pretty easy.  For BOA they have 2 different deposit slips one for instate the other out of state.  Take whichever one you need fill in the Name + account number + deposit amount
Once filled out hand it + cash to the teller.  BOA is one of the more strict banks and will ask you for ID on EVERY cash deposit.  Most large banks will ask you for ID while most smaller banks will not unless its a large deposit 3k+.  They wont ask you to explain a cash deposit unless you look real nervous/shady or its a lot of money

The miners just went through an unlucky stretch where they only mined 2 blocks in 2 hours.  It happens based off variance.  Just give it some time to even out

How do you figure?  According to the chart you posted Venezuelans were buying about 40 btc a week at an average price of $420 from January - April of this year.  
Since the start of August thier bitcoin volume has been over 240btc every week with an average btc price of $600-$750.   Thats a massive increase over a couple months.  Now take into account the average wage/purchasing power there has been plummeting there and it makes it even more impressive

Their both very solid wallets.  I have a trezor myself and love it

Im not saying that a small country like Venezuela is going to be driving the bitcoin markets but that there is very solid growth in the country. In particular when you factor in that bitcoin is ILLEGAL in Venezuela with local miners and vendors being jailed. 
 Your 34BTC per day is factoring in only localbitcoins data and only the exchanges that take place through thier escrow.  Im a vendor on lbc and i can tell you that 60% of my volume is off exchange
I just reread the original comment and i dont agree that btc is being used over USD but both are being used to circumvent the current system.  If you look at it in US dollars the bitcoin volume on LBC has 10x in 2016.  FACT

The USD can be cashed out via a linked bank account or paypal or kept in the coinbase account for future purchases
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:34:28
If your selling on coinbase they take 1.5% i believe.  You can transfer to GDAX and sell it there and only be charged .25% or 0% if you place a market order and its filled

Paxful.com is good for prepaid gift cards
Its like localbitcoins but more focused on gift cards and small purchases.  Just stick with the reputable vendors and you will be fine.  You should have bitcoins in under half an hour
@_date: 2016-10-15 02:03:37
Options vary based on where you live.  If your in the US i would recommend using localbitcoins and doing a cash deposit into another users bank account.  That would be the quickest way to get bitcoin and it would only be a 4-5% premium

From what i understand once Segwit2mb gets 80% hashing power that locks in segwit and it will be activated.  The 2mb portion would be activated at a later date.  I have heard 6 months but i dont know if thats locked in
