I'm not gonna argue basic economics with you. Have a good day.

??? I'm pretty sure all that stuff I can get for a few dollars that was a luxury only a couple generations ago me couldn't isn't exclusively made of paper. Would have to check though to be sure.


  
Why? Why take the risk and put in the work when I can just do nothing? They don't need to invest at all to make a profit.  
  


  
Nah, we still got it. And we will continue because [it]( [fucking]( [works](

Deflation is bad for the economy. That's a fact.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:37:07
In which way could a business depend on inflation? Deflation seems much more profitable to me, they don't have to invest anymore, they can just sit on their money and still make a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:45:48
That is simply not true. Every currency in the world is slightly inflationary or at least tries to be. Japan has  struggled with slight deflation for years, trying all sorts of things to achieve inflation. And so on.

Not sure I can agree. The only reason I as a wealthy man need a factory at all is to increase my wealth because if I did nothing it would decrease over time because of inflation. If the currency I hold is deflationary, however, I can just do nothing and my wealth will still increase.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:59:26
It would be heaven for the rich, the bourgeoisie, whatever you want to call them. Of course deflation fucking sucks, that's what I'm arguing here. Maybe work on your reading comprehension before telling me I don't know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:36:46
No. Lenders would make money off of deflation because the debts owed to them would increase over time. I'm curious as to how you think they benefit from inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:26:56
How so? Deflation leads to less spending. Less spending hurts the economy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:21:59
And that's good because...?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:53:50
Why would I increase production if no one's gonna buy my stuff. More demand leads to me increasing the prices to me making more money to me being able to afford more production to me being able to lower the prices again and hire more workers who in turn create more demand because they can buy stuff now because they have a job leads to more demand leads to more production and so on...  
Oh, btw: You can't argue economics with mathematics. And yes, you can just increase production without increasing L or K. It's called a loan.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:22:29
Companies and the rich will save as well. Why invest my money when I can just sit on it and still have it be worth more in a couple of years? Deflation is capitalist heaven, the rich get richer just by existing (the debts you owe them rise as well, mind you) and the poor get poorer because their debts rise and they can't profit off of the deflation because they have to spend their money to stay alive.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:57:03
See, but the only reason they keep their money invested is because it's not an asset because it's inflationary.

I dare you to post this in r/AskHistorians and have them validate its accuracy. You're romanticizing being dirt poor and frankly it's disgusting.

So what are you doing using reddit? What's stopping you from buying some land and living a farmer's life?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:10:58
'capitalists' have more money than people, yes? So they gain more through deflation. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:46:41
You increase your capital by increasing production, not by decreasing it.  
When fewer people are spending, of those 100 units 10 go unsold, so the company has to fire 10 of its 100 workers so these workers have to spend less, so now only 80 units are sold, and so on. When people spend more, there may be demand for 150 units, so the company invests in more efficient production and hires 20 new workers (spends its capital) who can now afford to buy more and so on. That's how the economy grows, by increasing consumption.

There is exactly zero evidence of there being electricity in any ancient culture. And why should the pyramids be full of soot but aren't? What are you trying to tell me here?
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:12:27
To what end? And no, that's not what I'm talking about. This is about slight deflation.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:25:50
Deflatation is bad for the economy. That's a fact.

Well you obviously know a hundred times more about this than this me. Idk, the idea that inflation is better than deflation just kind of logically makes sense to me, but maybe it wouldn't if I knew more about the subject, who knows. Also aside from all the logical stuff I just like to think that the people controlling our currencies know what they're doing and have a good reason to make it inflationary, but maybe that's just wishful thinking. Anyway, thank you for your time I guess. I really wasn't prepared to meet anyone on this sub who actually knows something about economics and certainly wasn't prepared for an argument with them.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:18:10
Why would saving boost the economy? What? Spending stimulates the economy.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:56:56
You mean the goverment? Which is elected by the people?  
Your first sentence is simply not true. Every currency in the world is slightly inflationary or at least tries to be. Japan has struggled with slight deflation for years, trying all sorts of things to achieve inflation. And so on. Why? From Wikipedia:

Isn't reddit a modern convenience? I thought you disliked those?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:26:46
We are just so far removed from deflation vs inflation that I don't know even know what we're arguing about anymore, that's why I'm rambling incoherently. Let's just leave it be, I probably don't know what I'm talking about anyways.  
One last thing though: I'm trying to argue using the bigger picture, meaning that when I say demand, I mean overall demand, not just demand for one specific product and so on.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:23


We're on the same side here. You should read all the comments in the chain before trying to argue with me.

Bitcoin is deflationary. The number of new Bitcoins is approaching zero, and it is only a matter of time until the rate of inflation can no longer keep up with the ever growing economic output.
