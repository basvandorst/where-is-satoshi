Can you cite a source for people arguing that a fork will result in bitcoin usability being severely impacted?

Interesting, I'm not aware of any extra regs for Arizona(doesn't mean there aren't).  
  
When did you stop selling on LBC?  Where you transferring to another wallet before selling on LBC or did you transfer from Coinbase directly?
@_date: 2015-08-08 15:03:11
Great.  Now people are going to say that accepting bitcoin has caused them to lose money because their ratio for people visiting the page versus buying a ticket has become inflated by rubber neckers.
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:41:09
You can use accepted methods and still do it wrong.  The only way you would be right here is if there was literally zero press about it and no one knew while the experiment was in progress.  But that didn't happen and instead you're here defending flawed results using flawed logic.   It would be funny if it wasn't sad.

When I like a company, I tell people about my experiences, I tell people why I like them.  When I don't like a company, I tell people about my experiences, I tell people why I don't like them.  This is not a conspiracy and I am not a coinbase employee.  I wish I was, can you imagine getting in on that?
  
Until Circle innovates in some way, I will continue to show loyalty to the brand that's served me best.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:23:53
If you actually delist it, that is a fair response and maybe I was a bit harsh.  Paycoin(Garza) has left a lot of us around here very pissed off.
  
EDIT: If bittrex sell price is .0001, why are you asking .04?  That is a far cry from 15%

That's not true, they always allow you to move your funds off of coinbase, they just won't let you do anything else and will lock your account after you have emptied it.

I'm not sure, I don't use Circle.  I use coinbase because they are more transparent, participate in the community and are constantly innovating.

Sorry for all of the questioning and accusations.  Just seeing Paycoin sends my spidey senses into overdrive.

You're the one being misleading.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:33:05
You should be clear here.  Is this a personal or merchant account with Coinbase?

It's the same on Android, I just tried it.  It tells you exactly when you can expect them to arrive.
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:38:19
That is weird.  I do a lot of business with coinbase and they have never asked me for an invoice.  Can you tell us what geographic area you live in so we can look at the regulatory environment there to help explain this?
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:05:52
All I see is you stirring up shit.  This is a non-issue because we all know that a fork will not make our bitcoins less usable.  
@_date: 2015-08-12 19:57:07
That's probably it then.  I think it's only an issue if you cross certain monetary thresholds(not sure what they are).  You probably crossed those thresholds and now they have to investigate(by law).  I'm betting that if you could prove that you were licensed to be an MSB, they would insist you move to a merchant account.  They are giving you the benefit of the doubt even though they are not saying much.  They're going to close your account if you do not respond adequately, we've seen it a bunch around here.
  
You can start using Circle.com but you need to change the way you move funds.  Always move them to wallets you control that can't be affiliated with a company and then spend them from there and always use new addresses.

Mozilla did the exact thing I described.  Started accepting bitcoin donations and received a bunch of press for it, press that included links to their bitcoin donation page.  So when their metric for page views versus donations was out of wack(due to all the press) they actually said that accepting bitcoin cost them donation money(probably to get even more press).

Absolutely not, Garza probably still holds most of it and he needs to pump it back up to dump it.  That's where exchangers like this guy come in.  ~~His exchange rate is way way above the competition too which makes it look even more suspect.~~(this wasn't true, I was piggybacking off another comment here without checking myself)

They're giving away free money, why wouldn't you sign up?  Unfortunately, they won't let me participate due to my account age.  I think it's pretty dumb to discriminate against new comers, I already don't want to participate now.
  
After interacting with their admins, it is clear this thing is gamed big time by those with access to resources.  Resources being aged accounts right now and IPs(for hashing(future solution)).   These people are either intentionally limiting competition or are idiots.

Regardless of whether or not this is Satoshi, this video is great for building perspective.  The Q&amp;A is a fun look back at history and reminds us of some of the early shortcomings and if you know a little bit about how bitcoin works, it's a small reminder that bitcoin really is just the beginning.
  
I don't have the will power to do it, but if there is a kind soul who does, a transcript of this would be great because the audio is very poor.

I don't think he's even telling the truth.  I can't find what he says anywhere on their app.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:42:02
It's probably more likely that it was a combination of activity and not just using Coinbase\Circle.  There are many many Coinbase users using BoA.
I use a credit union and they also offer business accounts, I would try a credit union over a big bank who doesn't need the customers.

That is the exact bullshit I am talking about.  Use your brain.
  
Not only did they base their "loss of revenue" on page views versus donations, not all visitors were presented with the bitcoin option, it was random.  So if you read an article that said Mozilla now accepted bitcoin donations and you went there looking for it, you might not see it the first time.
  
Whoever put that campaign together was either an idiot or a genius.  They got double the exposure for nothing.

Why do you think that deflation is bad?  With bitcoin, supply is not really an issue because we don't have to create more coins if we need more tokens, we can just make existing coins more divisible.  But a single coin is currently comprised of 100,000,000 spendable units so that i s a long way off, if ever.

There is no "real" symbol that has been approved and is commonly available in all operating systems.  The symbol coinbase uses is the symbol for the Thai currency called the Bhat.  It is available on all operating systems and can be reliably rendered, I assume that is why they use it.

People will still invest, profit will still be the main driver of investment.
  
I think your view of bitcoin is too singular, too focused on bitcoin as money and you are forgetting that bitcoin is more than money.  Bitcoin introduces not only the possibility that you can invest with bitcoin, but you can use the bitcoin technology to form companies where investors will have a direct voice into the course of the company.
  
Companies are very much like governments and will soon be more accountable for their actions because of bitcoin.  You will not only invest for profit, but because it gives you power, much more power than the current opaque structure of companies today.  There will be entirely decentralized companies that you will want to buy into.

There are various iterations of this all around the world.  The USA is an oppressive environment right now and that is one of the main drivers of adoption.  Look at the US and China, they both have strict regulations while the EU is not unified and is generally lax in regulating it.  The USA and China are the biggest consumers of bitcoin right now and this is a direct result of an oppressive financial environment that is highly technical(required for adoption).

If it is "It's wonderful, disruptive, everything. " then it will likely lead to change in many areas.
  


  
Something that is a currency and a technology is already a fundamental change to society and when it is formed like bitcoin it does excite the hierarchy and will likely lead to change.
