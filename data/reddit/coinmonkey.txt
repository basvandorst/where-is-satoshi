they're the smartest people on earth, for figuring out to their satisfaction that there is nothing after death, thus they are simply skipping to the end and bypassing all the horrible experiences that must be endured for the sake of occasional, fleeting moments of "happiness".
we can say they are dicks for leaving friends and family to grieve, but the people who are most upset are the gubmint employees who see their taxbase (thus funding, thus salaries, etc) shrinking.
the people we call "normal", the happy idiots, aren't burdened by more than an inkling of self-awareness. they just run their loops like good little puppies, thinking they are happy, unconcerned about possibly ruining other people's shit with their own negligence, excess, and lack of self-discipline. "just be yourself", even at the expense of others. "you deserve it", so fuck other people. "don't ever change" because you're already perfect. (when i say "you", i mean it metaphorically, as in the ego; i'm not referring to you specifically, *ButterflySammy*).
but don't worry, i'm the one who's wrong; i'm stupid for "thinking too much", for giving a shit about my fellow man. one day i'll get it. one day, i'll realize "it's all about me", and i'll become a happy puppy, running around pissing and shitting and chewing on things, not giving a rip about the messes i create. "someone else will take care of it." :-)

it depends. you don't pay taxes just for existing. you need to own land, make purchases (sales tax), etc... so if you are a couch surfer who only pays BTC for goods you will destroy (eg. food), then no, you can't be taxed, and you can probably dodge the census and other official stuff if you are skilled and have a network of people who won't sell you out.

this is compelling, but what's the incentive? at some point, the hoarded BTC is going to need to be part of a working system in order to have value/purpose/function.
is the NSA tasked by congress (or someone in charge) to simply control a significant quantity of a limited resource for "security" purposes? seems like quite an investment, but then again, the way the USA blows through money on death machines (eg. hellfire missile, $68K EACH), this might not be such a stretch.

it makes the most sense to invent the currency, grab a massive chunk of the first, "cheapest" (least competition when mining) coins, then wait and let the public's investment be the rising tide. once a stable price has been reached, the creator of the system has a hell of a lot of valuable boats.

sorry, it == life... life might be illusory (ie. the matrix, etc; i'm saying, never mind if it is... let's suppose reality is real).


initially, yes, but i believe this isn't strictly true; our choices about what to think direct our future thoughts. my experience confirms that if i focus on specific thought patterns, some of my future thoughts will originate from those patterns. by diligently directing my thoughts, i can make future-me "better", and i expect others to understand and do this as welll (by and large, they don't, IME; this is a major source of my discouragement with life, because i must suffer indirectly when they make bad choices).


sorry, it's not about who; it's about how i define my happiness. if i have a kidney stone, i can say i'm in agony (unhappy), or i can say the stone is reminding me i'm alive, which i like (happy). i feel that the latter is simply a rationalization to deny the reality (the pain). this is the self-delusion i'm referring to. i define my happiness by my mood, and it's difficult to choose a good mood when something unpleasant is happening to me (not impossible, but very difficult). i know that if other things can distract me, i can often 'forget' to feel bad, though.


now that you know, you would ask, i suppose. i would not. i would decline, absolutely, without even the slightest feeling of self-doubt (it is, in fact, the singular thing about which i don't have some doubt). this would entail my never-having-been, of course (the reason i don't kill myself is that it would make others unhappy, and i'm a people-pleaser by nature). i'm not in this for myself; i'm just doing the best i can to get through it without bringing suffering to others (which i must admit i fail at quite a lot, but i'm trying).


There is nothing to be done with pain except experience it - I say this as someone who has experienced pain.
okay, appreciated, but i have two problems: it seems that there are always new ripples being created, so the pond will never actually be still. second, it seems that no one should be bothered by pain (just "ride it out", so to speak), nor should we be bothered that others are in pain. my mind balks at that idea. i feel obligated by something within me (probably my parents brainwashing in my younger days) to help those who are in pain, or at least avoid increasing it.
i tried the *mu* thing. i don't know if i'm doing it right. i can't not think of anything while counting, because the counting itself is a kind of thinking. but i can ignore the counting; i tried a few times, and eventually became unaware of everything, like my brain defocused, because next thing i remember is hitting 31; i can only assume i actually counted the full 30, and completely without intention, my brain seems to have decided to "snap me out of it". i could feel myself actually counting the 31 halfway through it, and then i immediately regained the memory of having started a count; it felt like when i wake up with my alarm clock (sudden awareness). i don't remember what i did with my eyes, but i think they were open (i thought initially it would be a distraction, but i guess not). but i'm not any happier now; i'm only aware that i just wasted some of my lifespan doing absolutely nothing (!). doh! :-z
i've heard about this counting and detachment stuff from various sources, but what is it supposed to achieve? 
anyway, i really do appreciate your input, particularly because it's done voluntarily out of personal interest. thanks, and best wishes to you. :-)

HORSESHIT. most people consume too much TV, movies, video games, porn, booze, cigs, weed, and other "entertainment".
if people would give up SOME of this time/money to instead invest in personal development (eg. reading non-fiction books that teach them things like how an economy works), they would be paid back by the universe immeasurably.

hmm, to clarify, i was using "you" to represent the ego (anyone's); that which makes one distinguishable from others, rather than you specifically. the correct subject, "one", sounds awkward in current english. slogans like "just be oneself" and "one deserves it" aren't really used by anyone, so they sound weird. thus i'm using "you" as a metaphor for the ego; it would sound even weirder to say "one's ego deserves it" or "just be one's ego". :-D
perhaps you don't believe in ego, or even that people are real, and making choices (based on your apple-tree illustration).


this sounds like a complete disavowment of all personal responsibility.


it might be illusory, but i choose whether or not to participate in a dance; life, however, was foisted upon me. is there nothing you don't want to participate in? if you were taken hostage, would you decline to leave if given the chance, because you could just "redefine" the situation as something that makes you happy?
we are animals, driven by urges; we feel pain, and seek to avoid it. this fact clashes with the idea of "defining one's own happiness", but i have noticed that most people seem to have an herculean capacity for self-delusion.

this was the first wart i identified with the system when i first learned about it: to avoid the potential for "conspiracy", it requires a substantial number of early adopters who all start mining at the same time at the system's inception.
if satoshi and friends did significant mining\* before presenting the system to the unwashed masses, a lot of interested-but-naive people would still help pump the system full of "value", and by the time they figure it out, it's too late -- they are invested, so they can't abandon the system to "punish" the creators.

sorry dude, but what you're describing is a stagnancy. the ultra-rich are already doing that with existing fiat money (notice i say "money" not "currency") in their offshore accounts. if you want something to be a currency, it needs to be moving. the best thing to do with a bitcoin is to spend it, and get it going 'round and 'round. if it can't do that, it's doomed anyway.

that's most significant. BTC is still WAY FAR from the level of convenience and trustability it needs in order to be adopted by the masses. ease-of-use alone is a killer. until nearly disposable (cost-wise) wallets are as resilient and easy to carry as an actual wallet full of paper/plastic fiat, it's gonna stay niche.
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:22:44
kickstarter et al guarantee nothing either. it's not about that.
my point was that you can say, and prove, that you contributed, plus the money can't be "lost in transit" (ie. ganked).
lost cash is lost; paypal can steal your funding, and you can't do anything. BTC solves these particular problems. it doesn't solve everything.
@_date: 2013-08-01 13:45:54
1) people are scared of new things, ESPECIALLY when they involve one's livelihood (income/money). the untrained human mind typically responds to fear with anger when "flight" is not possible (and it isn't in this case).
2) open source, yes, but honestly, how many people do you think can ACTUALLY appreciate the bitcoin code? i use linux, but in doing so, i am being SUPER trusting of a bunch of nerds who wrote the code; i am free to look at it, but have i/will i ever audit the entire kernel i'm using to be sure there are no backdoors? bitcoin is like that, but with YOUR FUCKING MONEY. sorry, but you can't just say "trust me" to the average person. 
3) people are dicks.
4) no, seriously, most people are terrible. i've only been around for 35+ years, but i've seen enough. "people. what a bunch of bastards." :-I 'nuff said.
@_date: 2013-08-20 13:23:10
for one, it's safer/easier to give BTC as cash than fiat as cash (it's traceable and also can't be "lost in transit").

@_date: 2013-08-01 18:34:17


granted. ... ;-)


okay, stop for a moment. here's the problem: "greater interest in ownership among the general population" has some major snags, particularly that most people don't have the slightest clue how bitcoin works, while they understand how paper money works (it's backed by gubmint; you simply hand it over to spend it; he who is holding it, owns it; etc). most people are going to be afraid of it far more than interested in it; i've tried... people say "security?"; mention 'blockchain' and their eyes glaze over. how can you convince them of security unless they are willing to open their minds? it must be clear that much of traditional economic thinking cannot simply be applied to bitcoin.


but, like the stock market, people who are simply trying to make money from nothing (buy, hold, rise, sell) are gonna play the game of "if i can hold out just a bit longer, i'll be the ultimate winner", and then everyone waits for everyone else -- stagnation. people have to spend it to make other people believe in spending it.


buying anything possible with BTC in preference to existing value systems seems effective (you can get PCs, food, and actual useful stuff already). people with a lot of BTC can simply spread it around gift-wise, to get new people hooked. give your grandson a birthday gift of 5 BTC (with an explanation), etc. sure, he might blow it on video games (humble bundle you mentioned, etc), or something "stupid", but... it's creating circulation. people will squander their money no matter what form it takes. :-D
ultimately, there's nothing that can really be done, except educating the public; the system will grow naturally, and if it's any good, it WILL catch on. the hoarders who held to the bitter end WILL get their rewards, but before that happens, they are contributing to the delay (bit of a paradox, that) of the system catching on, because it is supposed to be used as currency. long-term storage of any kind of money is kind of stupid; money's very purpose is a common value exchange.
probably the crux, though, is government acceptance for taxation; that completes the business loop.
