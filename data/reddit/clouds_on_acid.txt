?? dropping?  It just went up $100 in the last few minutes lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:43
I'm betting it goes back up, but who cares as long as more and more people keep getting interested in it, that will be what breaks Bitcoin free of the institutions!

Solar power, it's the future and it's coming (slowly)

lookin' to get to Mars

Nice catch! I was taking a shower when it hit 19k, but I probably wouldn't have even known to sell
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:42:02
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BUY MORE BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:49
but don't you know Bitcoin only crashes upwards? /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:22
Nobody knows, but in my (short) experience, it has always caught up to its peak. No idea when it will dip, nor how low it will go
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:42
Honestly I keep hearing dip, but I only see gains lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:39
A MILLION IN '17!

Not bad if he bought before litecoin jumped a lot! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:37
That's actually really sweet
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:38
FOMO to the max, my friend sold at 11k and waited for a dip and now he's sad, but let's be real, nobody knows what will happen. I suggest you put a limit in, as dips will come and go quick, and just keep track of the price, you could get lucky with a massive dip due to futures coming!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:24:30
Yeah, you have to have the funds already available (in USD or whatever FIAT currency), and then you click the "Limit" button (next to "Market"), and just put what limit you would buy it at, let's say 10k. Then if it hits 10k, it will buy all available Bitcoin at that price until the order is fulfilled, or it rises again. Useful since the China market starts around 5pm PST and ends very late.

Probably this, there's no accountability for exchanges unfortunately, but I'm hoping it was just due to the load and not some nefarious reasons
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:49
Honestly , I don't blame them , and it's easy to transfer BTC to USD anyway. Once BTC stabalizes I can imagine more and more companies will adopt it
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:27:00
I bet it has to do with futures opening up next week, either by big players looking to short it, or it's genuine interest by tons of new investors. Really only the exchanges and the players would know what's up
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:46
what did you invest at? It's up 25% since yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:47:37
Fuckin' Ross had to go hard and start calling for hits on random dudes...and go to the same coffee shop every week to login...and live in America

Buy from Gemini, transfer to Gdax, sell, repeat...INFINITE MONEY
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:27

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:34:00
SELL THE HOUSE, SELL THE CAR, SELL THE KIDS, THEN THE WIFE...BITCOIN FOR LIFEEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:03:14
Wow, can you tell me more with your crystal ball oh wise one?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:42
I had some addy yesterday and could not stop watching the markets, gonna lay off the meds today, my heart cant take it lmao
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:01
I shoulda banged that ho
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:01
Well aren't you the optimist today ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:05:11
I bought at 7k, 8k, and 10k, all which were about all time highs, and I don't regret it, I doubt they'll regret it either
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:47
a billion
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:23
He's not even that great at his stock predictions lol, he just used his show to hype up stocks, which creates investors. He's more like a salesman
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:43
Contact your bank and tell them what happened, they may be able to recover your cash by contacting Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:08
ONE MILLION HERE WE COME
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:00
Honestly, there's been no point when Bitcoin reached a new high and didn't get right back up, this is just companies pumping/dumping to take the newbs money, at which point they will buy right back in
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:27:13
well he was smart enough to understand mobile phones before most others, at the very least everyone seems to grasp that blockchain is important
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:53:16
hahaha I think he did not ;)
