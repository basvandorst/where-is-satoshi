Greed is a core component of Bitcoin's business model (built in scarcity, increasing difficulty, etc...). While good for early adoption (it's cheap, durable and people will want some later. Let's hoard!) I think it is not that great for the future.

I don't understand how people using MTGox would have lost 30% of their value : the price can differ from one exchange to another, even widely so. There is no central trading platform, only a bunch of satellites with different users etc.. Of course the price tend to be uniformed but it doesn't mean in any way that 70$ is the correct price, and it might jump to 120 as soon as MTGox reopens.

Old. Also, no one pays in cash here, we are a credit card country, which makes life hard for waiters as they rarely get decent tip from French. This is an attempt to curb money laundering, and will affect foreign visitors less as the limit will be 10 000 for non-nationals versus 15 000 right now.

I actually own a company which does business in Laos, so yes, a few times, and not just in the touristy parts. People there mostly know how to phone and text, and smartphone use is non existent outside of "big" cities (big is a euphemism, as Laos has less than 7 million inhabitants and its capital, Vientiane, around 800 000). 
The value of Bitcoin here is mostly to entrepreneurs like me who need a fast way to get some money in or out of the country, but even for this, the hourly fluctuations combined with the absence of local Bitcoin seller make it impractical.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:40:44
What about coin laundry/mixing services? Wouldn't it negate all those issues for the thief and render the coins neutral again? Those services exist for non-legal reasons mostly, so they would probably not care about the provenance?

They took a risk which is mitigated by their wealth. As any reasonable human should do, especially with risk-heavy investments such as Bitcoin. Never analyse investments as net worth, but more as % of disposable income. (Also, loosing 11m$ is a harsh pill to swallow for anyone, even the richest people)

Gold can be divided as much as needed (though the ounce is used as the common unit of measure, but we could count it in atoms if we wanted, which is what satoshis are for Bitcoin). There is a finite quantity of gold (on our planet, let's not jump to hyperspace just yet, and even then, there is most probably a finite albeit huge quantity of gold in the Universe). Bitcoin was designed as a gold-like commodity, and, according to your definition, there is an infinite quantity of gold. Which there isn't. So maybe you are wrong?

Except you are seeing this from a perspective which is maybe not the most accurate one: Bitcoin can and will probably disappear. Until then, companies will ride the wave, and wait for the next (and probably more lasting) trend in cryptocurrency to jump ship.

Actually, I think it has been done. In France, Leboncoin.fr is used by lots of people instead of ebay, because our culture is geared toward direct sales, not auctions. eBay is used here when we need stuff from other countries. However there are lots of differences between the two services. Note that this site is a French version of the Swedish Blocket.se and that it has 31 equivalents in other countries. Leboncoin is the 7th most visited website according to Alexa, while ebay.fr is n°13.

Like most of the art : rich people commissioning articles. It is already happening in a way, with people (pardon the French centrism, but I take examples I know better) like Xavier Niel who bought 1/3 of Le Monde because he is insanely rich and doesn't really care if the newspaper makes shittons of money. He also launched a free CS school recently, on his own money as well, equipped with 1000 imacs and every thing. I wouldn't be surprised if other rich people decided to do the same. Maybe even some bitcoin billionaires :D
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:49:44
It's not dead yet, it's in flux. I wouldn't be surprised if it made a comeback in a few years, after a few whistleblowing articles are shown to be just that: whistleblowing.

So, will the release of this book include some Bitcoin related chapters? I preordered it so I'll let you know. If so, it means CEOs all over the world will read about it soon, and probably care. If not, well, sad panda will be sad.

You say that forgetting that Bitcoin is a worldwide (web) commodity/currency. Western Union could try to force some rulings, but it would not have that many effects outside of the US, which are probably not the biggest market for WU+BTC anyway. Remember Bitcoin is not grounded in any territory, unlike goldmines or reserves, so it is far harder to act on it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:58:32
It is still a lot, considering how well regarded gold is as an invesment. But this is of course a very short term view of something which could look like a simple dent in the charts in a few months.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:02:00
The price doesn't factor in though, it could cost 0$ and still be used to mine BTC.

You are missing what I'm saying. Yes, the network is decentralized, but as soon as some companies/entities starts managing your Bitcoins in your place, you are in fact preparing the ground for some sort of oligopoly or monopoly. 
Right now, Blockchain is in fact really a bank among other things, storing the blockchain and your Bitcoins for you. Which means they could destroy your money with the flip of the switch (and not just yours). 
2 days ago, I've read here that they weren't using open source code anymore (haven't followed the evolution since). That means you don't know how the stuff on their site runs. It could integrate a keylogger, do some nasty stuff, block your account or forbid you to send coins to some specific adress, etc...
So yes, everytime you use blockchain wallets (or anyone else's really), you are giving away the power of Bitcoin. 
And you give one entity more power over your wealth. This is centralization.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:24:04
I do the same, but I think it will happen. Their will be a "socialist" Bitcoin, and it will be a huge success, even more so than Bitcoin, probably because it will encourage spending instead of hoarding. Hell, the guy who'll invent it might even get a Nobel prize. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 07:26:45
The price in USD might be uniformly priced (which isnot even always the case), but for other currencies, it might vary a lot as not a lot of people might be selling. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:52:28
Not really, I only own bitcoins (and 2 litecoin cents, I don't think that really counts). But I am certainly not the only one saying that, though the characteristics of Bitcoin are very interesting, they might probably end up in history books in the next 10 years. We might only be preparing the real revolution. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 12:30:35
I'd love it if a country would accept bitcoin, as it would decorrelate it from the USD (not totally of course, but I always feel it's used as a proxy currency when it could be much more).

Amazon's currency project is a good example of this. Also, a medium/large country using its own blockchain (or something similar) could be a huge competitor.

We sadly don't count for a lot of the user base at airbnb, so they probably have weeks to think it through and choose to implement it (or not). They are probably aware about the BTC addition to 9flats already, as I suppose they have an intel/PR/marketing division doing its job. Time will tell anyway.

It is still not the same IMO. Bitcoin will probably not survive the test of time and Western Union will ride the trend until they don't need to. Then another (WU backed maybe? Who knows!) crypto currency will appear, it will be superior to Bitcoin, and WU will jump ship. Business as usual.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:50:41

@_date: 2013-05-11 10:19:09
Ok I was reading all the stuff about the Offshoreleaks, and doing the small test on cbcnews.ca, I couldn't help but notice that Bitcoin is probably a far better way to transfer wealth than most of the possibilities cited. The only thing lacking is a true bank in an offshore paradise.
@_date: 2013-03-09 10:04:34
Actually, I have :D (Lao PDR). Even though the Chinese distrust their government, having a figure of authority backing something always makes most of the population accept it.

Awesome. Another question : why don't you price your fee in BTC ? It will soon be 0.05 BTC, and as it is a small sum should not be affected by intraday volatility (not too much anyway).

I'm glad I applied and verified a while ago even though I had not made a purchase until recently.

Seems like it only happened because the thief was not careful enough. I suppose he will be increasingly more cautious, he might even find and read about his "assailants" and their tactics beforehand. The bitcoin world is still small.
Edit : from the second link (comments) 


Their page describes the system in place, basically consists of a couple of wallets. You send into wallet a, and then they send you new coins in a few batches from wallet b, at which point, they transfer the coins from wallet a to wallet b. at least how they describe it, it's not tumbling at all, just returning coins to you that you didn't have in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:30:57
Came here to say this. I completely agree with him that bitcoin is more of an asset (intangible but no less real) than a currency, but his point while comparing it to gold is that it is historically more commonly used than bitcoin. Well let's wait 3 or 4 millenia and check back then ok?
@_date: 2013-02-24 21:52:52
That could go in my TIL. Thanks for the correction.
@_date: 2013-03-04 11:16:31
Do we have statistics on the first time purchase of Bitcoiners on MTGox in USD? That could help us (loosely) predict the price evolution I think.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:24:48
Some people seem to be forgetting that and concentrate only on the "commodity" and not on the "currency" part. Hence those runs to the bank. At some point I hope the steam reverses, but until then we will have to live through this every now and then.
So yes, it seems important to remind people 1BTC=1BTC, and that the dollar value is something else entirely.

The thing is, whistleblowing is not new. It just became easier because the web is a nice tool, but French journals like Le Canard Enchainé were here long before that, and do mostly the same job (and practically don't use the web). Long form journalism, and investigation journalism, are on the rise after hitting an all time low because people forgot they liked reading in depth stuff, but remembered it after most news sites became glorified blogs. I think investigative journalism is a market in need of a new business model, or maybe something more akin to "art" where blogging/traditionnal reporting and whisteblowing became the "trade".
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:32:44

I fear there is a strong defamation campaign against Labcoin. I am of course worried about the small investment I made in it, but the shear number of threads calling it a scam vs. the threads about investments (spoiler alert: almost none, either positive or negative.) feel like massive propaganda.
