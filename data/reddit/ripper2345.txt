I'll copy the question I wrote on [AngelList](


Can you share some info on Joystream the company?
One business model is releasing an open source client with a small pre-configured donation to joystream, which the users can opt out of. I haven't worked out the numbers, but I get a sense that JS style tech can be huge, and if it is, then even a tiny donation from each user can add up.

Yeah, privacy concerns are an issue, especially with a company like ours, with a completely public expense ledger. However we believe the transparency is worth it. There is a balance that is required between privacy and transparency.
Hopefully soon technologies like ZeroCash will let us eliminate some of these privacy concerns.
The privacy concerns for "Normal" companies that don't have publicly exposed expense ledgers should be much less concerning.

Answer me this: how do you choose and **remember** a strong password?
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:20:47
1. POS/DOPS - this may be a bit "off topic", but I'll give my personal answer - I personally like Proof of Stake, read about DPOS a bit but haven't got into the technicals. I think exploring other mechanisms except SHA256 proof of work to secure the network is essential. It's obvious to me that Bitcoin must evolve or eventually be replaced, and altcoins are a great place to experiment with that process of evolution. The thing that a lot of people miss is that for most altcoins, if they become a major competitor to Bitcoin, Bitcoin can always copy-paste the code/features that make that altcoin standout. I'm still in favor of funding/investing in altcoins because More Power to Crypto.
2) We've seen a literal explosion of altcoins, and it's become really hard to distinguish the real innovation from the fluff. I don't think that any altcoin warrants a keynote position in a conference ... they're interesting as a talk or a panel, or a few, but certainly not keynote.
3. Bitcoin is not seen as associated / disassociated with any country - it's a neutral phenomenon, more neutral than even the internet. People divide into a few camps: The Bitcoin geeks who "see the light" and want to join in in any way or form, the Suspicious who think of the myriad ways Bitcoin can be used and abused to circumvent things like taxes or AML, and people who still unfortunately don't give it much attention, or just don't know a lot. 
We're here to eliminate the third group by giving them knowledge and explaining the relevance and importance of Bitcoin, and hopefully selling people in the second group to focus on the advantages rather than the shortcomings.
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:15:35
So instead of encrypted wallet, they used a brain wallet.
Brain wallets are less secure than encrypted wallets.
Nobody can remember the passphrase, so they store it.
Therefore, an attacker only needs to access your stored passphrase.
Instead of requiring both the encrypted wallet and your password.

Right, I should probablly stop since there are more secure, better alternatives ... however none with the combination of reputation, operations running time (time in existence), convenience and client side security.

@_date: 2014-09-22 19:33:14
Again, the GBA is acting more on the community/regulation/knowledge building - unlike the Bitcoin Foundation, we do not fund core development and not necessarily fully understand all the technical implications. So each of us may have an opinion on technical matters, but it's just a personal opinion.
Now to the question at hand - I **personally** highly trust both Gavin and Peter Todd, and what's amusing is they seem to be at a conflict on some of these core issues. So the best answer I could give you is probably "I don't know, but I trust that open discussion between the geniuses that are working on Bitcoin Core will get it right".
I worked with for a while, and I know has a really powerful way of thinking about these game-theoretical situations and he has a tendency to see things that other people miss. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:17:37
Also regarding the price - just don't worry about it. Pick your long-term strategy and stick with it, don't worry about short-term trends or fluctuations.
I believe it's impossible to know who or what is affecting the price ... such is the nature of complex systems. Read [A Random Walk Down Wall Street]( if you haven't already, it's a great book.

I think you may be misunderstanding.
Three partners join up with an idea to build a startup. One has a toy proof of concept project he built with some traction, the other has a network of VC connections, the third is a gifted designer.
How much do they get?
**Before funding ... zero!**
Paychecks, by definition, start when there is funding to starting paying (sometimes even later). This is what enturepenuers and founders know.
We are looking for a true enturepenuer and founder. There is no other way.
The Mastercoin Foundation will not be retaining any equity in the new company - it essentially starts from scratch, but rathrer with some resources, network, user base and team in place. If you believe in the vision, it really is a terrific opportunity!

We are in constant contact with the Foundation, and some but not all of our member organizations are also Foundation chapters. We certainly do not challenge them ... more people and organizations promoting Bitcoin - the better!
The GBA doesn't need a lot of funding because by design it doesn't do much on a global level - most of the work is done by the local organizations, each with their own funding mechanisms. The GBA's purpose is to coordinate and build bridges of communications between the different orgs and the community.

As individuals some of us are in contact with some developers, but nothing organized.

I personally have worked with Peter Todd in the context of Mastercoin, and I'm guessing Anthony Di Iorio as one of the founders of Ethereum has probablly had his share of contact with the devs.

Also, I would like to take this chance to call out for a formal or informal “Greek Bitcoin Organization”.  It doesn’t have to be formally incorporated anywhere, but surely there is a group of people who care deeply about Bitcoin in Greece. If so, we want to connect with you and see how we can help.
Our member organizations span [local organizations]( including Argentina, Canada, Israel, The Netherlands, Australia, Ireland, Japan, and more. We don’t charge anything to join, this organization is merely a network of national groups aimed at exchanging information, supporting and learning from each other.
You can be in touch with me personally here on reddit, or at ron  Let me know if there’s anything you need.
Good luck!

Two answers:
1. Fundamentals. The market will, sooner or later, understand the fundamentals. Bitcoin is not here to be bought and sold for a quick buck, it's here for the end game - world dominance.
2. Lots of good vibe lately. $30 has been shown to be possible in the past, although briefly. Lots of things going down soon: Mining reward drop, London convention, multisig. And the big question mark - will BS&amp;T default? All of these are pushing the economy up.

I personally don't equate "lawful" with "moral". So, to me, it's perfectly moral to live in whatever state you wish, and not pay taxes ... if you want to feel you're "doing your part", donate to charity or to specific causes.
Taxes are global, and fund things that I might not approve. I know the argument "what if nobody paid taxes" ... but that is just an argument from practicality, not morality.
Would it be immoral to live in China, Iran or other states that repress freedom of speech, minorities, etc... and not pay taxes? Some might argue **it would be immoral to pay taxes** in those countries, if you could easily and safely avoid it.

I have at least one or two friends who heard about Bitcoin, "wanted to invest", but never got around to doing it.

I do hold &amp; buy BTC, but that doesn't mean I should convert all my fiat to BTC. It makes sense for me to keep USD at Mt. Gox, to prepare for:
1. If it drops low enough (8-9), I'll buy some more.

For someone who needs to first convert his native currency to USD, then transfer to Mt. Gox (paying unknown conversion + wire fees) - my way is better.

You did read the "encrypt with a strong password before uploading to Dropbox" bit, right?
I am **not** trolling. When you use a webhost with a master key to your data, you are not ultimately responsible for it, but you rely on their security practices and trusting their employees. When you use a VM that you fully own, like Amazon EC2, you take responsibility.
The same kind of attack simply could not have happened on EC2, because there is no way for Amazon to "lose the password" because *there is no password*.
The next person to call me a troll had better explain how the same kind of attack could have happened on an EC2 instance.

The key features of this proposal are:
+ Requests for payment (Invoices) are tied to authenticated identities
using the only widely-deployed identity authentication system we have
right now (X.509 certificates signed by root certificate authorities)
+ Invoices include a user-friendly description of what the payment is for
+ Payments include where refunds should be sent
+ At the end of the payment process, the customer holds a
cryptographically signed Receipt that can be used as proof-of-payment
if there is any dispute with the merchant.

After a long period of not doing anything with my coins, I actually wanted to use my wallet to tip [LadyBytes]( when I found out my password didn't work.
Then I rememberd that I changed my password recently, and stored it on my Keepass. I searched my keepass database for "bitcoin", and didn't find anything, although I was sure I stored my password there.
After a few days, I had the brilliant idea of searching for "wallet" in my Keepass instead of "bitocoin" ... and there was the missing pass.

It's been discussed before (don't have a link off the top of my head). 
Naive miners might imagine "hmm, why don't I just tweak the software not to lower my block reward ... what's the harm in that?"
Of course it won't work, because the whole "early adopter thing" going on right now hinges on the limitation on the number of Bitcoin. I think there will be such a fork (just look at all the alts today ... someone will make that fork), but it won't attract sufficient support and hash power.

If I follow this argument, then 0 miners will be mining for the first n minutes. So the difficulty will be 0, and any transaction is enough incentive for another miner to mine, and he can produce a block in 0 time.

The argument  is trying to make is that because miners won't mine "as much", average time between blocks will be more than 10 minutes. Let's assume for sake of discussion that it's 20 minutes.
If it's consistent at 20 minutes per block for a long time, the difficulty will keep dropping in each 2016-block cycle. This process will continue until it's easy enough for miners to pick up the slack and find blocks faster than one per 10 minute. The process is self-adjusting.

Proof of working is finding an x such that f(x) = 0.
There are many solutions to this equation (many different blocks that can be mined).
If you want to "forge history" and mine a different block than the official chain, you need to work again to find a different x for which f(x)=0.
If you just want to copy history, then you're not "hacking the blockchain". You can use the official x that was already published, but you will have to include all transactions in it, so you can't double spend anything in x.
If you want to double-spend/reverse a recent transaction, you only have to find the solution for recent f() functions ... however, if the transaction you're trying to reverse happened 100 confirmations(=blocks) ago, you'd have to find new solutions to these hundred different f() functions. Every new f() function depends on the previous ones, so you can't just fix that one function 100 blocks again, you have to rewrite the entire history from it to present day.

Suppose you're conducting a business deal that could net you $100,000 in cash, but could also not close at all. Let's say the chance is 50% each.
Also, let's suppose you don't really have much use right now for $100,000, but $50,000 would do nicely. Essentially, you would like to keep the same expected value, but change the probability distribution of your net worth.
If you make a lot of small bets on peerbet, you can change your wealth distribution (and now, for the first time, without any impact on your expected wealth). You can't get any distribution you want, but you might be able to shape a distribution that's more to your likiing than a flat binary 50%: 0, 50%: $100,000.

As I wrote in my updated post - I missed RAM monitoring, which is harder but still possible.
So the only "completely" safe route for a serious Bitcoin business is:
1. Use your own physical machine.
2. Architect your system correctly (e.g. don't rely on database data to be correct unless its signed by a secure key).
3. Hire a top notch whitehat to audit your system (without giving him your keys / DB snapshot like Mt. Gox did back in June/July).
Yeah, the above costs a bit more than $40 :)
Still I insist that if you're just starting out / can't yet afford dedicated serves, an EC2 instance is more secured than a shared host.

I guess it's true, if you have root access to the host machine, you can always real the RAM directly. Still, it makes such attacks more complicated (I believe you'll need root machine access to launch a successful attack) ... but for true security you need a stand alone physical machine.

I wrote above that this does not address flaws in the application tier. Of course you need up-to-date OS, Apache, SQL and other software.
The key issue I was trying to address was the Linode attack - in this case, regardless of any patches on the system, a weakness in Linode or an inside job let to someone getting the root password on the system.
This should not be possible. For a server that holds 46,703 BTC, relying on your web host's security practices is negligent.
I wish all victims of the hacking only the best, and I'm not saying I would have done better myself ... just that it's their responsibility, not Linode's, and that better security can be achieved relatively easy.
EC2 is not perfect, but it seems safer than Linode.

Bitcoin also uses web technologies (blockchain.info/wallet) and enjoys other unrelated developments (LevelDB being integrated into bitcoin-qt). It's not being developed in isolation.

The column often has "investment tips" of various kinds, so I kind of expected Bitcoin to be analyzed as a bad/good investment. The actual piece was, IMO, just a *very* subtle intro to Bitcoin, without even going into the question of whether to invest in it or not, ... maybe the author doesn't know a lot about it at this stage.

It might give you a false sense that you'll get a meaningful amount of BTC. It might be more work than it's worth (making sure your GPU does't overheat, that the miner is running all the time, that you don't end up on the wrong fork of the chain due to stuff like [P2SH]( that your GPU won't break down due to running 24/7 ...).
@_date: 2012-01-12 08:52:37
Well, that's an interesting attack vector.
Still, vending machine cannot rely on miners not being selfish ... even if current miners are not, and prioritize transactions by time and not by fee.
This means that when vending machines actually become popular enough to attack, they might have to use green addresses or some other technique to protect against double spends. Perhaps you'll just have a "micropayment app" that requires a user account, so they would be able to blacklist cheaters.
@_date: 2012-04-05 15:25:54
From the thread:


It's just a problem for miners who didn't upgrade. 
Note that it's not a chain that is 35 blocks long that was orphaned in a huge 51% style attack ... just 35 different blocks mined by old miners that keep trying to include this invalid transaction and getting overriden by the majority of the network that have already upgraded to 0.6.

Hard drive encryption is necessary, otherwise the host running your VM can easily get your wallet. This mandates that all access to the machine is only via SSH.
It's harder (not impossible) to do a memory snapshot and get the decrypted wallet. You do have a point there though - I guess the only way to true security is running your own physical server.
Still, you'd need a much more elaborate hack to steal funds from a VM, than from a shared hosting provider.

I'm invested with both hashking and Patrick Harnett.
Patrick offers "solid" 1% weekly returns. This is [why I trust him]( I realize in the real world 1% is nowhere near solid, but this is Bitcoin, and it's different. This is the most solid investment compared to the others you can find on the forums.
Regarding hashking, I've been with him for a couple of months now, and made good money on sub-2% weekly interest. Most of the funds I have with him are insured by a private 3rd party ... if hashking defaults, the 3rd party pays me back my original investment.
As to how they make money - it's very simple, they lend it out to others ... nothing mysterious about that. Both are responsible to protect you from 3rd party defaults (in the non-BS&amp;T account).

1. This is only ever relevant around difficulty adjustments, that don't happen frequently.
2. The adjustment in the attacker's fork depends on the time it took to him find the blocks. If he finds blocks faster than the real network for some reason (luck) before the diff adjustment, he'll have to compensate for it after the adjustment.
tl;dr - for all intents and purposes, we can assume the attacker's difficulty is identical to the legit chain.

In theory, yes.
But in practice, if Gavin can't get a strong majority, he won't proceed with the current proposal. What's more interesting is a possible chain split at the end of the year, when the block reward halves ... I imagine some miners might want to make Bitcoin' with a never-decreasing block reward.
I sincerely doubt they will succeed.

[I asked how to decode the messages]( if their site goes offline - this is a good point that should be clarified.
It does not waste space - they are playing by the protocol rules. They are providing a unique service - the ability to publish a message in a global, super persistent way that can never be taken down. All that's missing is an open source message decoder.

C because the current protocol version doesn't allow it to be "infinitely divided". I think it should be a B, because we've already seen how the protocol can be changed if needed, and there's nothing inherent in Bitcoin protocol to prevent us from adding a few more zeros.
Also, in Offline Transactions it should also get a B, because you can generate an offline signature on a transaction today, not just exchange physical coins/notes.
Gratis Transactions - why a D instead of a C? D implies the author feels tx fees will be "too large for comfort".

What Gavin says and does is great, really.
Still I haven't heard a proposal such as this (not separate keys required to use a wallet, but separate wallets with configurable policies). If it can be implemented without any protocol changes, all the best, but if it requires a small backward compatible protocol change, why not?
Until now I thought such services (limiting expense from a wallet) could only be provided by trusted 3rd parties i.e. online wallets - but if the protocol changes to support this, you won't need to trust anyone to setup self limits.

Smart ideas like this is one of the reason I think Bitcoin is way undervalued right now, and has a bright future.
I would bet that 99% of the people who traded or ever heard of Bitcoin aren't aware of its huge potential beyond just a "dumb set of hashes that can be traded for money".
So, I think the market simply doesn't know enough about Bitcoin, and it takes a long time for this knowledge to spread to the general populace.
Since prices reflect market knowledge, this means there is currently a large delay between creating ideas and these ideas being discovered by the market and incorporated into their evaluation of Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin protocol is flexible. Nobody can prove that it "can adjust to anything a future rival might bring", but in practice - if there's a really compelling feature in another currency, the protocol can be changed.
Bug fixes were implemented in the past, protocol changes would be implemented in the same way, if deemed necessary by the dev team and by at least 51% of the miners.

GLBSE to Wall Street is like Bitcoin to USD*. There will be GLBSE related scams, just like there are Bitcoin related scams - it's much easier "scamming" when no guarantees are needed for trading.
Still, even though individual stocks in GLBSE might be poorly managed or just scams, GLBSE itself it a genius idea. It enables real world business to do an IPO and get actual dollars (by selling the Bitcoin they provide).
If some smallish business, that isn't large enough for a full blown IPO, but is large enough to be recognized and trusted, were to do an IPO on GLBSE, wouldn't you consider buying in if the price was right?
* except that GLBSE isn't distributed itself. GLBSE itself could turn out to be a scam someday, though I highly doubt it, while Bitcoin itself simply cannot be a scam since there is no central "scammer".

How about ... buy Bitcoin so you could be rich?
Some people may frown upon this, but IMO Bitcoin is still in the early adopter phase. If it really succeeds, anyone that buys now will have &gt; X100 on his investment. Yes, people who bought in 6-12 months ago will be richer than you, but it's still in your best interest to invest now (if you think Bitcoin will succeed), because in another 6-12 months it will be more expensive than it is now.

Heh, I'm laughing already at the first bullet - it claims Bitcoin is more secure than Paypal.
This is simply not true, not now anyway. With Bitcoin, a single maelware can steal your $500,000 wallet. With Paypal, being reversible, audited and insured, if your password is leaked or cracked they will catch it sooner or later, and at least some (most) of your money will be safe.
Bitcoin will be truly successful when enough "Paypal twins" that operate in Bitcoin come to life. The general public needs this kind of security, even if a few "hackers" can keep their wallet on this linux PC behind 3 firewalls, protected by a 20 character password.

Miners aren't the only show in town. If a majority of users / exchanges / bitcoin developers / miners agree that this adjustment is for the good of all, then miners will not be able to succesfully fork the chain, because the official client will reject their chain.

First, I'm not affiliated with the coin, I'm just a future early adopter. I didn't design it.
Second, I've used the argument "there will only be 21,000,000 BTC, ever" to explain to people why they should buy in now, while it's cheap. It's a bit difficult if not impossible giving a similar motivation for an infinitely increasing coin. I think a crypto currency has to have a built-in strong motivator for early adopters.

1. Remember you can ask specific question at bitcoin.stackexchange.com.
2. Namecoin is indeed different, but you now should be able to merge-mine both Bitcoin and Namecoin using the same GPU power. Use a pool that supports merged mining.
3. Keep in mind that mining will always be just barely profitible given the current BTC/NMC/USD rates. The market adjusts.
So, mine if you can get cheap electricity/hardware, or you believe the value of the coins you're mining is likely to appreciate. Or, you can always just buy some in the latter case.

You don't connect to random untrusted servers.

You send queries to N servers and accept majority vote. The only way something can go wrong is if more than N/2 of the servers are evil ... which is not likely to happen, as they'll have much more to lose than you if they're caught (this protocol will be used for "relatively small transactions", when compared to say Mt.

Seems like a proposal to consider Bitcoin legal by the US Gov.
Removing legal-tender status from U.S. Treasury coins and Federal Reserve notes generally, as Section 2 of the Act does, essentially broadens the gold-clause exception to allow contractual obligations to specify payment in, or indexed to, any medium that is an alternative to Treasury coins and Federal Reserve notes.
It opens the competition not just to private checks and banknotes, but also to gold units, silver units, units of foreign currency, Consumer Price Index bundles, wholesale commodity bundles, Bitcoins, and whatever else a lender and a borrower might agree upon.  If they prefer a unit for denominating their debt contract other than the Fed or Treasury dollar, they would be free to write a specifically enforceable contract in the unit of their choice.

Interesting point. What about in four years?
In four years, the block reward will halve for the first time, making it twice as much more profitable to mine before the jump than after it (except the market will anticipate this and adjust beforehand).
This jump actually gives a strong incentive to start mining long before that happens.
I'm not 100% my arguments here are valid, it's more an intuition on my part that fixed-supply coins benefit early adopters more than infinite supply ... it may be wrong.
The amount of TBX vs BTC incentive isn't calculated just by the percentage of growth, but is affected by absolute volumes as well. If I buy 21,000 BTC, then I know I own 0.001 of the theoretical worth of "BTC world". If I buy X TBX, I have to adjust it by the year, and I need a much larger X to own 0.001 of "TBX world" - so I value TBX less than BTC or LiteCoin.
Regardless, TBX is really not a good example because of the 7+ million pre-mined coins, so let's switch to FBX instead. I value TBX a lot less because I keep fearing it's a pump-and-dump.

Ah, I found the reason in the about page: 
Some wallet services work similarly to Bitventory, but they seem to share a critical flaw: they use Javascript cryptography.
Javascript is inherently poor from a security perspective. There's no easy way to verify that the code you're running is what should be running.
What other browser-based wallets do you know? (

1. Remember you can ask specific question at bitcoin.stackexchange.com.
2. Namecoin is indeed different, but you now should be able to merge-mine both Bitcoin and Namecoin using the same GPU power. Use a pool that supports merged mining.
3. Keep in mind that mining will always be just barely profitible given the current BTC/NMC/USD rates. The market adjusts.
So, mine if you can get cheap electricity/hardware, or you believe the value of the coins you're mining is likely to appreciate. Or, you can always just buy some in the latter case.

Yes, this is the idea, you nailed it!
Mastercoin to Bitcoin is like HTTP over IP.

By building on top of it we are able to move at lightning speed and provide solutions for the multitudes of companies and individuals desperate for such solutions (Smart Property is our top priority feature after the distributed exchange itself).

Until the recipient claims his bitcoins, when you "unarchive" the address (step 5), you get full control of the address.
One caveat that I didn't think of - I guess that he theoretically can control this address as well. So perhaps step 6.5 should be "make a specific tx to move the specific bitcoins stored in the unarchived address to a new address that only you control".

Up until now, I always wondered. I got a Yubikey from Mt. Gox a long time a go, and knew that My Wallet supported them, but was kind of afraid to reuse the same Yubikey, fearing it might compromise some of my security.
Now that I've read the OP I understand that associating a single Yubikey with multiple doesn't compromise the original account's security.
One caveat - I ordered my Yubikey from Mt. Gox, not directly from Yubico. If Mt. Gox somehow knows the Yubikey's private key, and I now associate it also with My Wallet, then Mt. Gox will have the power to impersonate one of my two auth factors.
I do not believe that Mt. Gox ever got my private key from Yubico when they ordered the Yubikeys from them (can anyone testify how this works?) In anycase, the worst that can happen is what I just described, but not the reverse - My Wallet (or anyone hacking into it) will never gain any benefit from this association that might help him break into my Mt. Gox account.

I just completed our first full time hire (will be announced soon), we have two more hires almost done, and two more open positions that should be done within 4-6 days. So if I'm successful then we just hired our first five employees within a week. Show me one startup company that does that ... and hires good people.
We're growing and scaling the organization.

Can you describe the flow you intended with more details? How does user registration &amp; authentication go, how does voting go, how are votes validated?
Perhaps even before the flow, it would be useful to describe the requirements you have from these flows.
Either the system has a centralized server/database, or it doesn't. I assume that it would, because most if not all websites have such centralized databases.
If the database has any user credentials that can be used to sign votes, then if it's compromised the votes can be faked.
If these votes aren't stored in the database, then a user would have to copy-paste them somehow (perhaps using a chrome extension as a convenience place to hold the certificates).
In any case, I think that you're missing out on a lot of KISS. I would start with a user/pass system, and possibly add more complicated systems later if really needed. The system can eventually support multiple authentication schemes, perhaps where only the "users with stronger authentication" allowed to vote.
I haven't tried CIYAMOpen myself.

You should of course not keep the users' password, just a strong bcrypt hash of them + salted. After you do that, it's as secure as PGP, assuming you enforce a strong password policy.
If you want to be able to prove that users voted in a particular way, you have to let them PGP-sign the vote on the client side - they won't send you the private PGP keys anyways (and it's insecure if they do).
On the other hand, you'll scare off anyone who's not a crypto-nerd from ever using your site.

Have you completely missed [this thread](
I'd love to talk about it with you sometime (email me at ron.gross but your behavior thus far has not been reasonable, and so I thought locking might indeed be required. I will be very glad to talk things through, we can start doing so via email or a bitcointalk thread, whichever you prefer.
In any case, your behavior in the wiki of constantly reverting edits which you do not agree with and rewriting articles without any support will not be tolerated. I much rather we come to a consensus about the proper way to decide these things rather than locking articles - locking is a lousy "solution".

Well, you know what I mean. I still need them because Bitcoin is volatile and the entire world hasn't converted yet ... but I'm needing them less and less every month that passes.
I'm attending 3 wedding this month, 3 of them accept Bitcoin checks as presents! (I made sure to clear it with them prior)

It does't appear to be locked - I can edit it.
In order to edit the wiki, [you need to donate a certain amount of Bitcoins](

Really? Entirely?
What's your buyback point?

I'm just too paranoid for that.
