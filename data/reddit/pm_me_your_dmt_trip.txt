How many millions of lives have been ruined by drug arrests and ridiculous lengths of incarceration. He reduced the harm that the drug war was causing. Yes I'm sure some people died from taking drugs received from SR1 but the overall tone of SR1 was about harm reduction. Reduce the amount of arrests for non-violent crime, reduce the amount of violence from doing drug deals in person, increase the purity of drugs, and have a centralized source of information on which dealers are scams and which are legit. He did an enormous amount of good and made the drug community (which would have existed anyway) a much safer place.
People die from taking drugs,  but more often than not it is a result of not having enough information about what they are taking (reagent test kits) or how to safely take it (not with alcohol, set and setting). SR1 did a world of good to inform people and connect them with harm reduction sources.

There was the armory on sr1. It was real. I purused the listings quite a bit.

Why do you want the armory listings to all be scams? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:39:49
Because they were fabricated smear campaigns to destroy to the public image of Ross.

The armory was a failed section of SR1. It was real and tried to sell guns  . I still am for Ross being freed. He didn't kill anyone. He's a hero

I agree he was a greedy fool but he started something great. Scams occur a lot more often in the real world than they do on the dnm because reputation matters so much to an online profile. I think Ross started something great and the next iterations of it will be even better. The future markets will solve the issues his had. There will be decentralized trust less platforms with anonymous trades and a self regulating market place. I mainly say "he's a hero" because the opposition so loudly condemns him. I haven't seen any solid evidence of him planning any assassinations and think his biggest fault is the same fault every libertarian has. They are selfish. His selfishness started something great though and in the next decade we will have markets that don't benefit a centralized entity that can get arrested. Distributed, anonymous, trust-less, and impossible to disrupt at a central location. Look at Open Bazaar. It's the future of trade.
Also, Escobar killed tens of thousands. Come on. Ross hasn't had a single body turn up. Ross saved more lives by providing clean drugs on a safe platform. If you weren't an idiot you could manage not getting scammed on the DNM. It really wasn't that hard, especially when multi-sig transactions were integrated. Ross started something that will lead to better versions of SR1 and for that my friend he is still a hero.

Simple solution. Legalize all drugs then regulate them as you please. Not joking.
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:27:30
I never purchased any but the listings were definitely there. You made it seem like that guns were off limits on DNM
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:50:12
Not true. He saved lives by giveing people access to safer cleaner drugs. He's a hero. He reduced suffering&amp;  death of all the drug deals gone wrong in the streets by taking away the streets. He's a hero

Bitcoin has gained/lossed +- 10% in a single day thousands of times. This is nothing new in the crypto space. You'll find that a lot of people here don't even blink at 10% losses overnight since a lot of people are gonna hold for 5+ years minimum. All crypto are massively speculative and very manipulated. If you want do daytrade to make a larger stack good luck. Most people have found that doing nothing makes them more money. Past performance doesn't predict the future though

I'm skeptical too but I'm sure there are ways of shipping firearms so they aren't detected. Use a decoy that is made of similar density metal and wraps around the disassembled parts. I bet some of them were real. I remember some of the armory listings encouraging escrow. It's basically impossible to scam without FE. Plus people could ship domestic and avoid customs. I wasn't for the armory at all, I just think it's false to say that no guns were ever sold on SR1. You seem kind of sour about it's existence or even the mention of it.
