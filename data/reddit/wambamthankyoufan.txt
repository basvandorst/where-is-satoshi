You're right.  Fans overload in a viscous fluid, which they were not designed for.  Fans take up more real estate in very expensive dielectric fluid, use 3-5 amps (2-4 in air). Since the fans draw power from the controller board, that's an extra load on the cheaply built Bitmain controller which can barely handle it's own power usage. IMHO.  Plus, the fans interfere with the natural convection flow of the oil.  We replaced our fans long ago. [ Our system is similar but we use two stage cooling: oil to water, water to air.  Convection currents cause oil to rise from bottom of tank to top, drawing off the heat from the Antminers as it rises.  As the oil gets hotter, the faster it rises.  When the hot oil reaches the top of the tank it overflows into and through a heat exchanger plumbed with chilled water.  The water draws off the heat from the oil and is circulated through a water pump back to a chiller located outside the building.  The cooled oil is pumped back to the bottom of the Antminer tank.  No external oil plumbing is used as the oil is fully contained within the system.

We run our water through a chiller outside.  Took all our fans off, convection flow works better without the fans which interfere.  [  Fan simulators and DIY Kits to replace fans on all Antminers including S9

We got rid of all our fans: takes up space (dielectric fluid is expensive), uses 3-4 amps for each unit, they fail sooner (loads the fan motor), interferes with the natural convection currents.
