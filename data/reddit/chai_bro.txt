When people are close to retirement bonds are usually a good idea. If he had a few percent of his portfolio in bitcoin sure it could be fun but crypto is volatile and people generally look for something not volatile around retirement age.

I don't know how much money Bezos had when he started Amazon, but he definitely risked everything by quitting his high paying wall street gig, moving to Seattle, and selling books online out of a garage. I guess if he failed, he could have gone right back to Wall street. But, he was probably at least a little nervous.

Fun story. If I had started working just a year ago and bought in to bitcoin while making regularly defined contributions to 401k i too would have a greatly valuation in bitcoin. Instead, I chose to go to grad school, now I just have a bunch of debt. It is a bold strategy Cotton, we will see how it works out.

bitcoin.org would be one place to start. FYI if you are on the reddit app the three little dots on the top right are where the community info is listed.

You can buy any fraction you want. Check the sidebar, it has information on how to get started. Obviously you should only risk what you are willing to see go on a roller coaster and not touch for a while. Inform yourself more than just seeing the wild price movements and saying man I gotta get in on a dip so I can become bitcoin wealthy.

That would be like a 1/1000th of a cent of gold
There is .005 mol of gold in a gram and thats (4.3632557e+15) atoms. Then 100 mil/ (4.3632557e+15) is 2.29e-8. 2.29e-8 *$40*1$/100 cents for about 0.009. Disclaimer: I failed gen chem but passed it the second time
