What investment strategies are there for cryptos? It's a whole new game. No one has even the faintest clue of how it'll end up. Projection models? You can forget about it. No one has a handle on the underlying fundamentals.

even if all the seeders adopt this, free market conditions will force the prices down so much. think about the people with seedboxes that can output terabytes of data for cheap. it wouldn't really be worth it to most ordinary users.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:28:17
while I believe that this is a fantastic idea, I find it hard to believe that this demographic of users will pay for any kind of leeching.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:00:32
Jfc, thank god I only bought $100 a few days back. That was at $300. Half its value now. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:14:11
This is unbelievable. Bought in just a short while back at 165 and I watched it just spike to 210.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:28:34
I dunno about "literally 0" but I think there would be very few people. It is way too volatile to the point where a single day's fluctuation could result in thousands gone. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:22:03
I use coinbase. I don't think it's sketchy at all? Unless there's something I'm totally oblivious to.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:24:07
I'm not too sure on all the details but in the past oh, I don't know, 30ish hours, the price has tanked really really hard. Volatility is high, jumping up and down 20-40% in just mere hours, so it's got everyone in a frenzy.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:30:06
I picked up some when it bottomed out at like 160ish yesterday

If you're putting a significant portion of what you can invest into bitcoin, I don't care if you have the means to do it, it is still not a very smart thing to do. Now if you want to call it a gamble instead, well, then yes, that is your decision to make. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:19:58
Have you told anyone about your bitcoins? Because from what I'm reading, it sounds like someone knew you were holding onto a lot of them. That might be a good place to start. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:33:50
It's still interesting to see how different events shape the movements of bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2016-06-26 18:21:01
Why is he not allowed to use it? You're free to suggest that leaving coins on an exchange is not the safest practice but don't go around acting like Coinbase is a fraud.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:58:46
Good luck getting higher bitcoin adoption rates with a $25 transaction fee..
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:31:50
No just because you buy at 1000 doesn't mean it'll be sold to you at 1000.
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:45:06


$230 increase (30%+) in a month isn't fast enough to be a bubble? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:08:52
Within the next week. I think it'll break through $1000 but won't go much higher than that.
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:34:14
You think it is shady that companies require you to prove who you are before you're allowed to exchange for bitcoin? Its the same thing with any other online brokerage or bank. When you deal with money you need to prove who you are.
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:57:45
Can't tell if you're serious but you're extrapolating from 2 data points. It ended around $750 in 2013 and $300 in 2014.

I use Excel extensively, especially at work. Once you get past the basic stuff, nothing else can keep up with Excel. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:46:15
Realistically real estate (especially in a good area) is a much better investment than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 05:22:05
That's shit reasoning. Where's your proof? 
@_date: 2016-09-14 15:30:44
Its really sad how anyone who believes in science is now considered a "big pharma supporter" by anti vaxxers. Vaccines have saved hundreds of millions of lives. In many first world countries there are now dozens of deadly diseases that have been eradicated. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:25:15
Same reason why you wouldn't go around telling people how much you have in your other investments...
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:15:03
There's no way nvidia would do that even if it were possible. They're raking in so much money off of the crypto hype.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:27:23
You say you know how to trade but you're gambling away your money on penny stocks. Stocks are in a roaring bull market and you managed to lose money. AMD and HMNY are up significantly YTD. It takes significant skill to be this bad.
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:05:44
Is there any way to sell to the site at this 8% rate? Seems like all the buy offers are at 25%. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 10:12:56
Yes, since everything else is fluctuating too. I think your confusion stems from not fixing your reference point, or "counter currency."
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:23:08
Go read the news about the decline in value of the pound?
You're comparing two different currencies whose values fluctuate, and recently, in different directions. The exchange rate to BTC will change accordingly.
If a currency loses value then you need more of it to exchange to another one. That's why it is more expensive to buy BTC as the pound weakens. Does this answer your question?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:23:04
The price is correcting. Really has less to do with your weekend theory and more to do with the fact that the recent rally is finally coming to an end.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:19:04
The price is massively correcting itself now. Might take some time before we reach $2800 again.
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:35:29
Well at least he gives a solid reason for having Messenger separate from Facebook. Look at what happened with Foursquare and Swarm. So unnecessary.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:35:45
Well Venmo isn't instant either. Banks are a long way off from having instant transactions. No one can get around that. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:03:02
I'm pretty sure you can get driven to base camp, so the only level of fitness you need would probably be getting into a car. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:31:13
It has been a very exciting last few hours on coinbase exchange ;)
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:09:25
True. But if your intention is to plant a bitcoin flag at base camp, take a picture, and leave, then acclimatizing shouldn't be a big problem.
@_date: 2015-03-17 07:15:35
I always have a few checks lying around. Never know when you're gonna need them. You can get way more than 100 checks for $11. Stick to the plainer ones. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:25:48
You can do that already with a lot of different services, ie Paypal.
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:37:51
I think it's really awesome that bitcoin is gaining legitimacy with so many different groups of people. It's little things like this that really demonstrate how bitcoin is ready to take center stage.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:27:33
Maybe not 80% but the fact that it's so far away from 50% means that there are definitely other forces at play here, like speculation.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:44:28
It works the same way with venmo too. If your friend pays you, and you want to withdraw the balance to your checking account, it takes a few business days.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:36:55
Hi :) first time dropping in. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:22:26
Couldn't you use a new address for the sake of this one time purchase?
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:52:31
Are we at the moon yet?? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:04:11
But the price has slowly increased to where it is now in anticipation of the event.
