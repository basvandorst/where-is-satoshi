Maybe 5 (?) years ago, I saw a thread on Fatwallet about mining Bitcoin. It was profitable back when I saw it, but I never got around to building a mining rig. (And I will forever kick myself for it.) I bought BTC a couple months ago, and it's doing well so far. I am a HODLer, but I am also a noob. 
My question is this: if I want to set up a node for Lightning, what is the best way to do this? I have a 1TB usb drive sitting around and my work laptop is idle more than its not (nights/weekends/when I'm OOO). Should I set up a node on there? Use a raspberry pi? How do I get it set up? Where do I start? I don't want to install something and have to redo it all in a month. I'm looking for a quasi-set-it-and-forget-it type solution.

And when you buy enough bitcoin, you will have billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars!

Is there any benefit to being an early adopter (other than giving back to the network)?

The blockchain technology has significant application outside of cryptocurrencies. It is - by far - more impactful than just the currency itself.

Right - it's a *really good ledger* that's helpful to provide a definitive chain of transactions. It has the potential to completely destabilize (for the better) the industry I'm in - online media/advertising - which is notorious for fraud and trust issues. This is a multi-billion dollar industry that will see many more billions of dollars if we can utilize an immutable, trustworthy, decentralized ledger that can help solve problems that have plagued the industry for years.

Well specific to AdTech, there's this:  
...but for other examples of application (and some ways that it's powerful), you might want to check out some of these lectures:

Then he used his (literally) amazing market acumen to execute a collar trade and kept billions of dollars most people would have lost. He is a very smart businessman and just saying “anyone could have come up with that” takes a lot away from the reality of his intelligence.

Uh oh... hard fork.

You mine in a pool. ASIC equipment has decent ROI. I've been using Avalon 741s and they're pretty rock solid/cheap.
