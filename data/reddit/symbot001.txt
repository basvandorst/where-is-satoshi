I'd classify Pyramining as a bad investment, not a scam.  Money is lost either way, I suppose.

I live in Sweden and use Kraken. It is easy to open an account and you can make deposits in Euro from your SEK denominated account using SEPA transfer.
I also tried safello and can confirm that it is easy. But I believe their fees are higher than Kraken.

I use Handelsbanken and SEPA transfers seem to be free for me. If there is a fee they have hidden it where I don't see it!

That's not a troll post.

I disagree.
Confidence in the two forks will be expressed by willingness to run nodes, buy the tokens on exchanges, and use them as a store of value and in commerce.  If the two forks duplicate each other in terms of utility then one will out-compete the other and take over most of the value.  But if the two forks have different forms of utility (which I think they will!) then both can thrive.

Because "PayPal 2.0" will not be a clone of current PayPal.  It will be permissionless, borderless and based on a deflationary token.  And, I was an early investor in PayPal 2.0, so I would like to see it succeed.  PayPal 2.0 is exciting!

Thanks for the suggestion...  I actually listened to that podcast a couple weeks ago!
I did not listen to it again, but I don't remember getting the impression that Gavin did not value decentralization...  I did get the impression that he thinks we need to balance different goals, think about potential trade-offs that will impact things we value, and act pragmatically.
Gavin seems convinced that we should raise the blocksizelimit now to encourage adoption and mitigate risks associated with other scaling solutions.  That seems like a very sensible plan to me!

I voted  and 
1 is the current set of miners firing the Core developers.
4 is the Core developers firing the current set of miners.
In this scenario, hodlers and Bitcoin dreamers like me get PayPal 2.0 *and* a slice of whatever version of decentralized money utopia the Core guys can create.
That's a win-win.

This site is a 'dropship' front that advertises cheap products shipped direct from China.  I had no idea this kind of thing existed before now. 
And it is run by who got advice about how to drive sales with deceptive tactics from right here on Reddit!
So it is a scam.  Not the worst kind of scam since you get a product that you might have purchased anyway.  But still a scam since the website is full of deceptive tricks that drive you to into the purchase, and you wind up paying too much for Chinese plastic.
Props to for figuring it all out in his thread.

How about an ebay-like auction site, but only for digital goods? Artists could upload low-quality samples of digital art (think pictures and ringtones) then auction off 1 or 10 or 100 high quality 'originals'. Automate the process so everything happens in real time and auction winners get near instant gratification for bidding aggressively.  
This idea probably works best for amateur porn...
