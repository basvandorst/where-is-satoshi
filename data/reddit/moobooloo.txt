I've gotten gold and btrash. Where can I exchange the other shite?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:34:21
This is just wild.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:30:54
Lay off the gangja ��
Is bcash losing market share daily?
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:36:05
What bad news
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:48:01
He needs mental health help. He can't be serious.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:17:17
Keep up the Lords work. 
Is there real time graphs?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:10
This isn’t right. Does anybody have any fucking clue whatsoever what the fuck fuck fuck fuck is happening?????!
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:37:53
It isn’t bitcoin. Sell that crap. If someone creates a fake dollar it doesn’t make it a dollar. The real dollar is still the only dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:37:43
Ah I see. Thank you. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:23:08
Comical isn't it
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:01
I say so too
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:38:37
That link says 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:51
Thanks roger! You scam artist. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:36
Enron 
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:34:12
Why is Bch failing?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:01:17
Yeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaa cowboys
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:12:37
Fantastic 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:23:21
Right, so we need a more even distribution among the public and not whales?
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:16:21
Oh I’m not fucked at the moment. I got in at about £30. So I kinda just ended up here. I’m finding it very interesting. I wouldn’t get a Lamborghini anyway ��
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:10:40
Brilliant. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:22:15
Surely most of the transactions are currently traders? Potentially trading between each other.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:00:03
Or am I talking bullshit ��? Just makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:00:58
It’s Sunday. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:46:36
Sure. I’m feeling more positive personally. If someone had told you we would be at this point from its initial release, you would have assumed an underlying mental illness. However it has happened. I don’t think it can be stopped. Just the fact we’re discussing it says something. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:21:45
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:11:22
You promised. Kinda. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:31:44
He needs to stop. He is going to have an entire sub dedicated to him soon. Cringe. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:21:47
Which dip? ✌️
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:09:02
That’s what annoys me too. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:19:16
I have to admit. The energy situation does bother me. The solution is renewables, though. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:16:51
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:28:33
I can't figure out if this is true or not...
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:12:23
How do you feel? Curious. Not sure how I would be in all honesty. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:26:25
At the moment it feels to someone like myself with a basic understanding of finance/economics that this is the wild west. I feel, personally, that if the SEC regulate this market it would bring more stability. The point of the SEC is to attempt to regulate and control these markets and stop fraud etc, so why wouldn't they want to start the regulation process? I would have thought they would be actively attempting to avoid the wild west situation we seem to have currently?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:23:43
Good news at the moment. It isn’t rejected. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 12:03:57
I had an airdrop on that shit too. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:29:18
just checked my pockets - empty. :-)
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:32:55
So we're fucked in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-08-05 11:31:51
Do you invest in bcrash?
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:29:00
Just don’t bother is the true answer. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 23:03:06
I don't understand what is going on? Is there a back story you can link me to?
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:30:53
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-08-19 11:37:04
Yeah looks bad. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:34:27
That would be nice sure.
But fuck living in Manhattan. I visited for 1 week and the pace of life is way too much. Each to their own I guess!
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:17:40
Great comment. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:53:01
Sarcasm? Can’t tell ��
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:21:11
Right, so by the size of the market it will stabilise by shear size? With public companies I would assume their shares don't move 'around' as much as bitcoin, thus their prices being more stable - I understanding it isn't a stock, but I'm pointing out that bitcoin has a 'larger' market than some small company public shares?
I'm still learning about economics and finance so keep calm!
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:20:53
Well yeah. Kinda of like buying apple or google now.  The big gains are over. If you thought like that you may as-well sit in bed all day and give up. You’ve missed all sorts. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:38:11
No shame. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:02:12
Is this complete market manipulation? How can this be stopped in the long run? Generally curious. How do we stablise the price? Thanks
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:33:16
You’re wasted here. You should short it. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 06:35:31
We're waiting for your achievements to be listed...
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:38:28
Just play games on them.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:34:06
What does this mean?!
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:11:05
Roger wishes he comes close to Andreas, the little turd.
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:10:04
But why?
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:22:52
Kinda my thought.
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:25:47
@_date: 2019-10-27 10:09:31
No one will admit to being his parent.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:29:21
Trezor are great devices. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:24
Didn’t mean to sound heavy sorry. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:31
Hero. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:42
These brain wizards are half the issue we’ve had over 30 years. Financial bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:22:44
Not sure. It could be if the main sites go down there is a rush to the smaller exchanges who can’t cope. Thus they go offline too. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:07
Yawn. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:46:42
It seems remotely odd all exchanges are down. Some sort of dos attack?
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:31:08
Crypto just feels like a mess at the moment. Disheartening.
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:23:52
Can you explain whats going on? Been busy with work so not much reddit ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:49:19
Can't wait for it to hit 0. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:28:44
Sounds good to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:21:35
Can just see roger secretly wondering what the fuck he has done. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:42:49
Some of this must be related to the shit show over btrash. These guys are bad news for crypto currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:20:09
Bitcoin jesus dumping his bshit on his disciples. His disciples must be thinking this quietly. Quietly wondering and deep thought - was I correct in thinking roger could replace the real bitcoin - am I retarded? Do I just fancy Rogers cock or do I dig his currency? Confused. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:37:48
Just put in what you can afford and feel comfortable with :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:40:31
Yeah. Great site and never had any problems. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:39:21
Start with Wikipedia - 
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:22:43
How many is usual ��?
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:26:58
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:01:58
I have downloaded the blockchain (fully) as of yesterday on a high speed connection. Does anyone want me to make this available to download? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:43:57
Which alts do you buy and also where do you buy these alts?
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:07:28
This sounds far fetched.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:11:20
Quit talking crap.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:35:29
I've only seen the bitcoin-cli binary. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:14:20
Trezor is fantastic. I'm from the UK and it took about 5 days if I remember. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:42:49
The days of the super cheap bitcoins or CPU mining bitcoin is finished. These are the 'bitcoin mill/billionaire' stories you hear. Forget it. Just join in to the level you feel comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:12:47
Have done - all setup. Bitnodes shows my node is reachable :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:55:51
I have spare computer with an old graphics card. I don't use this machine anymore. Is it worth joining in even just to help? Not bothered about losing money.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:53:56
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:05:28
Great post. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:42:57
I was about $30.00. That was all I could afford at the time.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:00:31
I'll be setting up tonight!
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:13:11
Yeah bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:56:45
Could you explain this a little more? I've been Googling and don't quite understand. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:55:07
I'm confused. I understand you can see the pdfs. But what does this content mean?
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:54:57
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:13:57
I'll send you $1 in bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:10:55
I'll give you $1 ��
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:44:24
I laughed at your honesty :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:46:10
Bitcoin is holding value because human beings are agreeing to its value. We're deciding it stores value to us. Other might not believe it does.
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:18:46
No man its one dollar I'll just give you it. Get you started with bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:46:20
My man
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:10:59
Oh. So current non crypto etfs manipulators want a bitcoin etf to play with?
Thanks for the reply 
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:10:20
Jesus would be nothing without god.
