@_date: 2017-12-13 16:32:16
I've spent thousands at overstock. Come on eBay it's time for you to take our magic internet money
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:04:41
I literally want to buy a piece of art with btc. Been trying all week. I'll pm you my email so you can send me pics and prices and if I likee I buyee
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:49:43
I didn't see it.  Where?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:53:49
How are you not banned?  I just used bitc to buy thousands worth of stuff on overstock and paid nothing for it
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:24:32
I used it to great success for Christmas shopping and my New Years resolution is to use it for all food travel and retail expenses

You're getting warmer. When people invest in things they cannot afford those same people end up in bad life situations and then end up forced to sell. At that time they sell at a loss and their bad behavior brings down the price of the asset. When this happens, responsible people that invested thinking they were getting value for the price get burned along with the bad actors. Therefore, stakeholders in investments have a responsibility to responsible honest investors to sell assets when they become overvalued in order to prevent bad actors from profiting. So by me selling today I am punishing the guy who mortgaged his house to buy bitcoin and saving the value of the coin for the responsible guy who is in it because he wants btc to become his primary pure stateless banklrss money that he can use in his life. By the same logic, I invest more in assets I believe are wrongly shorted by manipulators looking to cause panic. That punishes the big banker who doesn't actually believe the project is bad but thinks he can make a quick buck scaring people. That's what the big short and it's writers didn't understand. The irresponsible investor and the manipulative banker are superficially varied manifestations of the same thing. And they are both to be fought.

I think the way overstock works is they have some type of deal with coinbase where the transactions are done off the chain. I also bought that satoshi paper wallet art the guy in showed me the same way. Seriously buy something on overstock using your coinbase wallet and you will see for yourself that I gave you an accurate descriptor of the process
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:09:06
I don't want it to tank but I'd like it to spend a year or so at similar prices to what it is now to get rid of the people taking out loans to buy bitcoin and get rich quick people. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:20:28
Not on coinbase for a $10 purchase. People like you are insufferable. Wtf why would you assume that a $10 purchase is the average purchase price and thus commanding the same fee. ?  You can't be implying that. Is this what fud is
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:19:54
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:35:15
Nope the spending must start now. So go spend some btc on something you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:20:50
You've got it backwards. We have to start spending now to force adoption. Remember kids, if you don't spend your bitcoin bcash wins
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:57:01
Nah. We just have to start spending the stuff so businesses adopt it and we avert the bubble
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:28:52
Overstock takes it for no fees and transactions are instant.egift takes it and you can therefore use it for food and Uber. Expedia takes it so you can go on that trip. Now stop being scared and think of that thing you want. Yes that one. That one right there. Now go buy that. This is how we fight the bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:02:01
No sir. Just apparently the first person on this sub who has figured out that the only way we force adoption is by buying stuff. So buy yourself something awesome for Christmas I know I did.

except that it cuts the fiat money out which is itself a huge deal look dude i mostly agree with everything people say about the current state of bitcoin transactions but I've got a nice reserve tucker away of quite a few cryptos that I'm never going to touch and now it's time for me to implement a fiat free life. In my opinion doing this will drive the improved technology by forcing vendors to adopt bitcoin and implement all the tech we need to make it work. The big block small block debate feels to me like Microsoft v apple. Both sides are valid and have a place at the table The big blocks will work better for implementing quickly and cheaply (Ms computers) and the small blocks will be more secure, use weird workarounds to stay smaller and generally hold value better (apple). The nice thing about being a free person and consumer is where there is competition and both sides are full of good people fighting like animals for what they believe you can just invest in both sides.

Dumb money around our best shot ever at freedom is lethal. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:11:58
Just started doing this myself and I'll share my own reasons. People that spend all the money they have and whose money and productivity are broke and poor. People who constantly pour money into investments merely in order to make money from the investment and not because they have a rational belief in the underlying utility of the investment create bubbles. It is only those who both invest in as well as make use of the creation itself that ensure its value. Therefore everyone who owns bitcoin should be spending it and saving it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:18:32
See I utterly disagree with you. I am doing a 3 month almost full adoption experiment. I can't use it for my rent phone bill insurance or to fund my 401k but I can use it to buy cvs gift cards and in My city that means I can buy groceries. I can also buy Uber gift cards with it so I can use it for transportation. There is a beautiful understated restaurant that accepts it. Through Expedia I can travel get hotels and rent cars and through overstock I can get clothing gifts and some tech as well as going to newegg for tech. I know my form of adoption is crude but my day to day life will be as that of a free man for the first time ever and I could not be more excited. And this is what must begin if the project is to work. We must circulate it in order to force adoption and then those who do not adopt will lose their businesses. Holding it forever will not make the great dream a reality.

When this is your commercial
You know that you have attracted dumb money. We need the price to drop and stay down for a bit to get rid of some of the bad investors while they finish work on lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:36
Why do you do this? I just looked at the fee and it's 99 cents 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:39:59
This is good. Coinbase has done a lot for us and helped many people into the crypto space. I am happy to take them at their word. Now what about bitpay?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:59:16
The only way it gets there is if you guys start spending and force adoption so buy yourself some nice stuff for the holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:59:38
Shiiittt just kidding my boys about to lose a sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:45:18
I'm gonna be honest guys. I sold a good bit as well. Not because I've lost hope in the project but because I think the price jumps have attracted people spending more than they can reasonably afford. In fact I'm going to try for full adoption in my personal life for a couple of months all retail at overstock all travel through Expedia and buying gift cards for cvs groceries. I think it's going to work and I'm going to love it.  Bitcoin works as an investment in better money but you can't live in it or eat it. I'm the housing crisis in the us people with average incomes had properties they were intending to flip with mortgages they couldn't afford. Ultimately it hurt us a lot and the price of housing did drop. But it wasn't the end of property purchases in the us any more than the tech bubble ended the Nasdaq. It's just that I read stories about people going homeless or mortgaging their homes to buy bitcoin and they don't seem to share my desire to adopt it and that makes me want to take the price down a notch. The sooner bitcoin dissociated itself from irresponsible behavior the better. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:13:15
Dear Ebay: we have money for you. Come take it. I literally tried to contact your customer service to tell you this. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:20:08
Nervous is better than deluded. Listen to that part of you that is telling you your behavior is dangerous. It is. Prioritizing crypto over your home improvement is not peak bubble behavior but think about the housing crisis. People were taking loans for second and third homes while they still had mortgages. Taking out a loan for crypto when your home needs repairs is similarly problematic. If you don't want to get burned by a bubble or be the cause of a bubble, adopt more conservative behavior. If this thing blows up people such as yourself not listening to their inner voices wil be to blame. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:16:41
Not at all. I'm talking about the people taking out high interest loans and mortgaging houses who have no idea why this is a better system and just want to cash out for more money. These are the people who cause bubbles and anyone who loves bitcoin does not want them anywhere close to this system. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:11:57

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:43:31
Idk I just know that when I placed my overstock order the same price listed on the invoice was what came out of my wallet and it was instant. I think you guys need to spend less time with your eyes on the chain and more time doing transactions with the businesses that have adopted btc and less time staring at the chain I think you're will find that the quality of experience of using bitcoin in its real world form is travel through Expedia retail through overstock and food and transportation through egift you will find the experience significantly better that what is described by some terrified sense of groupthink running through this place. Seriously. I have provided falsifiable evidence  that btc works in the day to day life and you can buy stuff with it. Stop being tunnnwl visioned and go buy on overstock. It actually works so well 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:48:22
I'm not going to send you my receipts for my Christmas shopping. The claims I made are easily falsifiable by anyone who actually has bitcoin coinbase and lives in a country that has overstock. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:01:34
The fact that you took out a loan to make this investment should make you nervous. I suspect it does and this is why you replied to me. This is absolutely bubble type behavior. As a crypto investor it definitely makes me nervous. I hope you have paid back the loan and maybe another conservative behavior such as cashing out some of your profits as well as the money to cover your capital gains taxes ensuring that you actually are living within your means first and foremost. The kind of people that need to take out loans to buy bitcoin are the exact people that make smart investors want to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:22:43
All I got was a coinbase invoice id and an invoice. Maybe overstock does some kind of off the chain stuff?  At any rate go buy something on overstock with your coinbase wallet you will ha e the same experience. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:23:01
And you are dead wrong. The only way you force adoption is by using the businesses who adopt this forcing their competitors to follow. Now go buy yourself something nice
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:04:23
Well if what you're telling me is I'm going to have to pay capital gains what I'd tell you is im ok with that. I'm taking it live brother. I can afford to pay the taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:33:38
This guy took out a loan to buy btc instead of doing needed home improvement.  Please don't upvote this. This behavior brings no value to bitcoin and risks harm to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:22
And I'm telling you that I'm ok even paying my income tax rate. Time to make it real. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:25:25
So we're clear this is not my view. My view is that sellers have a job to police prices and sell if the price exceeds the value. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:20:20
Maybe so maybe so

I prefer individual consciousness but in essence, absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:07:54
Yes. i want the price to go down so I sold.  Not all but a good chunk.  That's why people sell when they think that there is money in an investment that brings negative value. That's also why sellers shouldn't scare you. Selling is a very important part of any market. Bitcoin has positive value as a new way of life but it is as destructive as any other asset when people are spending more on it than they can afford. And when investors see evidence this is happening, selling is a duty for the sake of the integrity of the asset. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:23:58
Yes to me this is the biggest point just holding is actually a bigger risk than spending. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:49:03
All the ones I want are sold out feelsbadman. Very nice tho
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:24:24
And everybody else should too. This doesn't mean stop holding but money only works if it's both a store of value and something you can spend. And the more you spend at overstock the faster we get Amazon 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:42:19
Dude reading your story makes smart people want to sell. You bring no value to the project.

Apartheid was a compromise you never should have made. The world treated you like colonizers when in fact you were just people that wanted to run your society with a bunch of foreign laborers while not being consumed by them. The only thing you did wrong was the decision before apartheid. Romans used to lose their citizenship when they married barbarians. Nobody who knows history doesn’t understand what actually happened with apartheid. Btc gave you a 20x last year. You could have used it to leave. Now you have to get out by other means because of the cashies. But you have to leave. It’s not in us.

Where there are no ownership rights there is no ownership. He doesn’t own anything. No South African does. The choice is fight a genocidal fight in which your goal is to kill every invading man woman and child until the enemy completely capitulates or leave. The capacity that turned South Africa from nothing into a prosperous nation that created the issue in the first place still belongs to him and his people. Leaving the land will not revive the dead virtue that gave the land value.
