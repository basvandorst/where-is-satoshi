This is what happens when you dump bcash for Bitcoin.

What does that even mean?

The lack of meme support levels is frightening.

Hardly an attack on anyone.  It's a brief summary of the ridiculous drama.

Segwit (softfork) = upgrade  
2x hardfork (lacking consensus, CEOs pushing it) = attack.

Odds are high they will list any shitcoin that will generate fees.

That's the point.  Fungibility is broken in Bitcoin and needs to be improved.  Spy services like Jeff Garzik's Bloq need to be obsoleted.

We don't.

CEOs naturally think they're in control.

It's ok.  There's an app for that.

Consensus is measured through users, businesses, developers, miners through various polling methods, but nothing is 100%.  There's an overall market sentiment, that you can get a feel for once you're in bitcoin long enough, but everything is still subjective..   For a BTC hardfork to be successful, it needs ALL stakeholders to be on board. 
2x hardfork is DOA, because the developers and community is against it.

Microsoft sucks at social networking, so instead of trying to create another social network to compete with the likes of Facebook, they're creating a technology stack that deprecates Facebook.... and essentially every 3rd party identity provider.    
Blockchain is used to anchor the DID records, so that instead of asking facebook.com/user/SatoshisGardener for user details you'll be able to crawl the blockchain and find all the pointers (kind of like DNS records) to everyones identity "buckets".   It's like a global phonebook.  Oh, and your keys control control your identity, instead of some 3rd party.

BTC is out of government control.  It's also global, so everyone in the world can now opt-out of their nation states reckless money printing and growing piles of debt.

So true.

This is how you Bitcoin!
