SegWit is a compromise. SegWit is a block size increase. SegWit will reduce fees. SegWit will enable Lightning which let's users transact instantly. SegWit will do all of this AS A SOFT FORK which is OPT-IN. Users have a CHOICE with soft forks.
HARD FORKS ARE FOR AUTOCRATS AND DICTATORS.

i can see from your comment you don't know how bitcoin operates. nodes enforce rules. miners only order transactions. if a miner generates blocks that dont follow the rules, the nodes invalid that block and the newly generated coins (AKA they lose money)

THE COURT: Are you presently under the influence of any drug or medication?
THE DEFENDANT: I've been taking cold medicine.
THE COURT: All right. Does the cold medicine affect your ability to understand what you're doing right now?
THE DEFENDANT: It might impair my ability to determine that. I feel pretty miserable. I have the flu currently.
THE COURT: Would it be better to do this a different day?
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to do this today.
THE COURT: Again, I don't want to have a problem later because on reflection you don't believe you understood what you were doing. Does the medicine you take affect your judgment to the extent that you don't understand the questions I'm asking you?
THE DEFENDANT: I don't think so, Your Honor.
THE COURT: All right. Does it affect your understanding of the importance of this particular proceeding?
THE DEFENDANT: I hope not, Your Honor. I'm sure my mental capacity isn't, you know, up to par compared to how it would be normally.
THE COURT: Well, I want to be clear here that if you have any doubt about your ability to comprehend and understand what's taking place we should -- we should do it another time.This is truly a case of haste makes waste. If you plead guilty today and decide two weeks from now that I really didn't mean to do that and if it hadn't been for that medicine I wouldn't have, it's going to be a very messy thing for everybody concerned especially for you. So if you have any question in your mind about your ability to think clearly this morning, I will continue this to another day.
THE DEFENDANT: In all honesty I think that that might upset, you know, two of the attorneys present and I'm willing to sign today.
THE COURT: But, you see, I appreciate your concern for them, but if sometime in the future you have buyer's remorse about this plea agreement, to be very blunt about it, and you say, "I didn't understand what was happening and I didn't knowingly and intelligently give up my rights and I didn't understand the consequence of my plea," then that would have to be litigated. I don't want to create a situation where that's going to occur. So I have to ask you again if you have any doubt about your ability mentally to proceed this morning, then we should proceed at a different time.
THE DEFENDANT: I'm prepared to sign today. I feel I can do so knowingly and intelligently.

Which one? Bitcoin.com? Bitcoin.com was purchased for millions of dollars a couple years ago. Bitcoin.com has links to illegal gambling in it. Bitcoin.com has a mining pool which mined a rejected Bitcoin block which lost the pool roughly $15,000. Bitcoin.com uses deceptive marketing. Roger Ver owns Bitcoin.com and decided to put illegal gambling on it, the deceptive marketing, and he made the choice which resulted in losing money.
