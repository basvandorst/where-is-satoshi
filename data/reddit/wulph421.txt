I'm trying to wrap my head around it so explain like I'm 5! I'm still very new to all this. I have a decent understanding (at least i think) from all the reading and video watching I've done over the past 6 months, but I want to hear what you guys with more experience have to say.
Basically, I understand why some mining pools are trying to break off if SegWit2x doesn't make it to 2x, but what does that mean for the original BTC and do you think if there is a hard fork, will Bitcoin Cash climb over the next few years like bitcoin has? Thanks to all you beautiful people!

That's what i thought but i wasn't sure. Thank you. I was reading it and was thinking how i could finesse it hahaha but then i saw 'you will receive your coins AFTER your activities.'
