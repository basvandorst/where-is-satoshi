Got a 50er sat unconfirmed for nearly a week now, unconfirmed txs going up. It won't be a few days ��

In 3 weeks it should be rejected and available to resend from the destination. Check the destination and attempt a resend. As others have said, check the mempool stats to send with a realistic fee, it will probably be lower than 70 s/b now.

How do you see pending transactions above a fee?

Check the transaction on blockhain.info. It will have the date that you sent the transaction on. You state 3 weeks above, is that not a fact? Transactions should never last beyond 2 weeks.

1) Sweep the wallet into coinimi as bcash/btg.
2) shapeshift/changelly into BTC
3) Send BTC back to a new paper wallet

Sorry part 2 is meant to mean that. Amalgamation of forked coins with your BTC, ready to send back to a new paper wallet.

C=M is likely to represent the Last Modified field (column = modified maybe)
O=A is ordered by ascending, click on the Last Modified column header and it changes to O=D, which is descending.

Thanks for a VERY informative reply.

This is what I was looking for. I see lots of hate for alts on here but with little to no reason given. Your response clears things up so thanks!
