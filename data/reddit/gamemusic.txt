Thank you for that

Then why use the hash when a spend immediately makes the key non quantum safe anyway?
The owner of that address obviously should make another private key according to how I understand you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:29:00
So convenience instead of security

" a unique address should be used for each transaction"
"It also only functions by accident, not by design, so cannot be depended on to work reliably."
Every sentence is against this
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:51:58
Not according to wiki
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:25:41
"Once you spend it, you should spend everything to **new addresses** because of that distant possibility."
Should say private key according to how I understand you.

Unfortunately, we have to make a few upgrades to our support and backend systems to handle the increased traffic and load.  As such, we have halted new user registrations for the time being.

**if btc goes down 40-50% from 15,000, even if it rebounds intraday!**
Flash crash
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:13:51
Then back to the original question.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:30:57
Why is a new address sufficient as opposed to private key?

'reverse the position' is translated as sell BTC 1 dev ABOVE
buy BTC 1 dev below
automatically buy if 3 dev below and sell if 3 dev above
Do I understand?

I saw a lot of Bittrex animosity on reddit.
Is Bittrex better than advertised?
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:08:59
Can anyone explain to a noob?
Will this let bitcoin be store and litecoin currency until the bitcoin transaction speed is addressed?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:08:21
same issue with that and actually nervous a complete paper wallet may be too technically demanding for now
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:27:58
what is node decentralization?

So the transaction is still slow, but you have potentially a personal chain for every person that gradually distributes the money?
As described this sounds best for repeat customers.  Essentially a subwallet dedicated to a particular pair.
The revolutionary part is potential series connection of the pairs?

Not an option yet... maybe after purchase
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:45:32
but any rebuttal to arguments of his?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:38
Link that please
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:45:10
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:43:45
i want to see arguments on veracity
fud can be truth
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:11:04
so basically this is why investments go regulated

what is the actual thing japan did?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:22:22
what is fud

Can litecoin theoretically handle say a billion transactions per day as would be expected of a mainstream currency?
Can bitcoin theoretically ever implement the sweeping changes necessary to match it?
I ask not for transaction capability myself but if bitcoin theoretically in the future could be a true currency.
