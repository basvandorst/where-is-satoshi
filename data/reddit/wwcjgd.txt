The moment I saw darknet markets switching from BTC I knew it no longer served any function. Lol "store of value".

What do you mean? 1Gig blocks have been tested, 8mb are plenty big for the time being. It could be 5 more years before BTC is ready for actual large scale consumer adoption. It is not a band-aid. It is a literal fix for the current fee problem. Sharding, LN, increased block sizes are all pieces of what will be a multiple solution process for scaling these networks. The whole block size debate makes absolutely zero sense now that it's no longer about philosophy. I'm not advocating on-chain everything. It's just the devs could fix the issues BTC is currently facing with a one time small block size increase and it strikes me as odd they refuse to do so.

BTC and any crypto has use without mass adoption. Do you really consider 900k unique BTC addresses as mass adoption? I think we both agree that no crypto atm is worthless. The point however is that LN will not solve any of the issues BTC is having right now WITHOUT mass adoption. People keep posting on here hoping, praying, believing that the moment the devs release LN somehow BTC will be back to how it was before, and even better, but that is not even close to the case.
And I would certainly never assert you are an idiot, but cryptocurrency is not about beliefs, or my team vs. your team which it has devolved into since the fork. As it stands now though BCH, and many other alts, are a superior coin with better functionality. Why do you believe that is going to change anytime soon? The reason BTC is so high right now aside price discovery is also because every major exchange pegs alts to BTC. When that changes and BTC still has not innovated look out below.

It's a question of adoption though, right? I really do hope this is all temporary, but even when LN is released it will not do squat to help alleviate fees until there is widespread adoption. I mean, after 4 months only 10% of tx are with segwit  I fear it will be the same with LN.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:17:53
Seriously, segwit adoption has taken a sharp spike down...

"The design outlines a lightweight client that does not need the full block chain.  In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification.  The lightweight client can send and receive transactions, it just can't generate blocks.  It does not need to trust a node to verify payments, it can still verify them itself.
The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed.  For now, everyone just runs a full network node.
I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less.  It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in.  The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.
At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN."

Sucks when millennials have to keep voting in people from the greediest generation in American history.

I mean if you can name any use cases for bitcoin outside of minor merchant adoption (now going backwards due to fees) or darknet markets (now not feasible due to fees) I would be happy to hear them. This shit was supposed to change the world and bring simple financial tools to people all over the world for almost no cost and with no central authority. Sorry, aside from it being a store of value and main street's new trading toy I've been more than happy to cash out and take a break for now.
Strange, I kept accumulating bitcoin over the years because I was hoping for this exact scenario i.e. BTC going to the moon. However, now that it has happened I want nothing to do with it. Have sold a large majority of my crypto$ and will just enjoy the profits. I have friends now buying in hand over foot despite hearing me talk about it for last 5 years who the moment I begin discussing the actual tech or even the simplest of topics with such as hardware wallets their eyes glaze over. This shit is way WAY over hyped and priced atm. Hopefully the value will come back down to reality for what it offers. Really wish we could just fast forward 6months to a year in this space and get this wallstreet price discovery bs over with.

I agree that it's difficult to address the ways in which that action is being stopped. One way that I feel is ostensible is how social norms and stereotypes portrayed by media and our government propogate a certain wave length of thinking. There is such a fine line that an individual in America needs to tread in-order to appear non-radical and I feel those innate forces continuously make people feel as if the way things are going now is alright. I don't know if I would even call myself a socialist, but it's frustrating when I see people bashing an economic philosophy that goes against the ingrained thought of ultra-wealthy groups not being the best decision makers for the much larger groups below them. There is a really good book by David Rothkopf called **Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making** that talks about what I'm trying to get at. I'm not an anarchist and I believe there should be a government and that its role should be to make society as good for all groups of people as possible. I don't feel that is currently happening.

Missing the word "with" in the first sentence. Sounds like a great service.

The issue with this thinking is that a government can be anything we want it to be. It does not have to be based on the single definition that you just outlined. And people can argue human nature all they want, but human nature is capable of evolution and change, and that more-so than ever as technology and human experience become more and more entwined. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:43:41
My allegiance is to human beings. Robots and software can be used in conjunction with policy that makes quality of life better for everyone. In an ideal society people do not have to work to obtain the necessities of life.
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:00:22
Because socialists support strong unions and workers rights. Both of which America no longer has. Even if the government gives more money to corporations in a socialist environment that money is going to the people and not the ultra-wealthy. Hope that is food for thought.

You do realize that most people support BCH because it is much closer to what BTC used to be, right? Not to buy coffee, but low fees and quick confirmation times. LN does not solve anything without large amounts of adoption, and there are other methods of tackling scalability such as sharding. Making the blocks 8mb, 32mb etc. certainly can be a part of that puzzle too. Bitcoin has essentially been broken for the past month and those issues will not change anytime soon.
But sure keep telling yourself the reason BCH has a 30B marketcap is cus' people want to buy coffee.

 Just listen and think about what is being proposed by bitcoin. It is a completely new technology and it will change the way people save and bank their money. You're desire to be enlightened is up to you to search the internet, not for me to spend hours finding ways to prove it's worth. Bitcoin is much more than a means of purchasing goods or holding wealth.

It's still nice to hear people who can articulate those ideas AND make it digestible to the average person. He is using his fame to spread messages that one would not necessarily hear via mainstream sources. I don't worship the guy, but I don't hate on him for doing his thing, either.

Thank you for the reply. I keep my coins on a trezor and am just having a hard time conceptualizing what will need to be done to make sure I don't mess anything up. I have no doubt there will be more information as this whole situation progresses.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:38:28
Can you explain how this works to me? Does it just mean that my original BTC wallet will be able to send a copy of the balance to an XT wallet therefore creating two sets? Would the fork invalidate trezors at first?
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:33:08
Are you really asserting that mainstream thought is a reflection of objective reality?
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:43:38
Except you can move 7k easily for a 10dollar fee in an hour to an hour in a half. Heck, I just moved 800 dollars for 8 bucks and it was confirmed within like 10minutes.

I was going to write a longer post, but suffice it to say I totally agree with everything you wrote. Cheers to the future of crypto :).
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:08:15
I'm not denying the fees suck compared to what they were within the last few years. I just still consider BTC the gold standard and long term I still believe it to be the way to go. 
Honestly, I just bought some BCH for smaller transactions until BTC is fixed and it is insane how much cheaper the fees are. The "high" fee on trezor is half a cent to send my full balance.

Always a fun infograph to look at:  (scroll to the bottom for a shock. I at least was shocked by how small the cube of solid gold made from all the gold ever mined is.)
I would rep Apmex as  but  is also a good vendor and even accepts bitcoin with a discount.
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:27:08
Just  because it cannot with current tech does not mean it couldn't in the future. Just don't become blind to the idea that bitcoin may not always be around.
And I say this as someone who not only owns some bitcoin but am an advocate thereof.

Big money has the advantage of a larger influence over how the market moves. In terms of the regulation being "suggested", I think you misunderstood what he/she wrote. I don't seem to see anywhere in the text a suggestion for regulation.
