Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I remember a proof of concept site that had this a while back. It started mining as soon as you visited the page, CPU usage was immediately pegged at 100%. If that ends up being the future, then I'm siding with the judge and hope this kind of thing doesn't get out of hand. 
What they effectively accomplish is generating money at the expense of the visitor. That's much worse than the ads we have now

I believe with 2 5830s in a pool you should be getting like .6 - .8 btc a day
EDIT: difficulty just jumped up, you'll get about half that now =(

I think you're a little late on namecoin to be honest. People moved there when the difficulty was low and made a quick buck then moved out when the price went to 0.06. At 0.06, the profits between namecoin and bitcoin mining were relatively close. Difficulty went up and the price is now high: 0.034 and low: 0.018 T_T
EDIT: I should clarify that the difficulty went up after the initial rush to it but will actually be decreasing next update to reflect the exodus of miners after it was no longer profitable.

That might be until you start losing money by mining. I'm more concerned about how long it will be until the money I generate just isn't worth the hassle

We're not curing cancer here buddy, if there's no money in it for people they won't do it. You think having it only stay profitable for those with personal datacenters is a better idea?

unlike a lot of altcoins, people actually use dogecoin to buy stuff

"premined scam coin" is a funny punchline

Give you the only important part of my social security number? No thanks

Just a matter of time before I get an email saying there's been a data breach. Besides, they can verify my identity another way, that's just lazy on coinbase's part.
