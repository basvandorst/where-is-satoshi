I see your point, but it also show you have not been exposed to counties outside the US: there are many counties in Europe that have higher per capita earnings then some states on the US and are ruled by politicians with strict monetary links to large economic groups ... and I assure you that in europe we have lots of computers an criptocurrency awareness is vastly superior that the US. 
Like I said, no one is forced to use bitcoins. If you dont find it appealing and if topics I've mentions are of no consequence to you, as an unsubscribe button on the top left, feel free to use it!

thx :)

i'm awfully sorry sr, but, there there as been a theft of stuff, mostly due to stuff being malleable, you see? 
So now I will be holding on to all your renaming stuff ... just until the court says so of course.
For further inquiry you can reach me at the Pacific island I just bought. Your inquires may take some time to answer since all the staff is busy writing the new constitution, witch is centered around the concept of "no extraditions no mater what"!

Ghash - Giga (10^9) hash, usaly means ghps, gigahash PER SECOND ... simply put is a measure of how fast your hardware is mining. 
 p2pool, BTC guild - Usualy mining is done in pools, groups of users trying to solve a block. BTCGuild and p2ppool are two examples of such pools.
hashing - this is what you do when you try to solve a block. You try to solve a mathematical problem called hash or rather you try to solve what is the value that generates a given hash.
 51% attack, mining centralization - if at one time one entity controls 50% of the blocks that are being generated by all the miners in the world it can launch an attack that will allow him to spend 1coin in multiple places, by doing blockchain forking. Mining centralization may lead to a 51% atack.
hope this helps :)
PS -also ... see ero79's link it will help you allot I think

Agree, but if it is proven that there is intention to profit while harming their clients that might be illegal,  in my humble and law ignorant opinion.

Thank you indeed. For you contribution for us all in the most altruist manner any one can ask for. 
And thank you for showing me that  the work of a  simple person can make a change that influences the entire wold ... not by being a corrupt politician or a greedy businessman, but instead for using intelligence and hard work.
We stand in your debt!

Thank you Tyler! 
I'm not a user of this particular  extension but I do use chrome daily and it is very good to know you guys keep an eye out for problems specific to the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:26:35
And who exactly will they attack? bitcoin is not a country, it does not have headquarters, you can not get a complete list of persons who use it and even if they do ... it will be hard to get those people to give them up, even if they use the wrench method!
@_date: 2014-05-29 12:17:21
That is freaking amazing!
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:11:05
My approach would be to compare everything with the fiat system ... and explore the advantages of btc over fiat : 
* who "owns" the money 
* how is new money "created"
* how do you keep the money  (ie, wallets)
* banks vs be your own bank
* how do you make an internet purchase (addresses)
* how do you make an physical purchase (QR codes)
* how exchanges work
And then ... if you have the right crowd ...  a little of more advance stuff:
* the public ledger concept
* hashes, public-key cryptography and Merkle trees (if they are hardcore :P )
* double spending 
* anonymity and money laundry 
* wallet security best practices 
* mining 
* advance use: prof of publish, Namecoin, etc
and end up with light stuff:
* satoshi nakamoto
* altcoins
* the devs and the community 
* some projects: hardware wallet, tipbot, etc
* the site, the wiki &amp; irc
 
hope this helps :)

I'm glad you feel safe with a federal assurance!
I'm not an US citizen and have no knowledge of how things operate across the pond. What I can say is that my government is corrupt and acts in the best interests of the large monetary groups that back there political party. They gladly steal money from bank accounts, reduce old people pensions and increase taxes all to bail out a bank that is of interest to them. 
May be US is different, politicians are altruist and act in the best interest of the people who elected them, maybe political party don't receive large sums of money from private companies and when politicians step down from their offices they wont go to work for them in high management positions. 
I don't trust mtgox or any other exchange with my btc for any substantial amounts or for any extended period of time. Unfortunately, similarly to banks and fiat I still need exchanges and I use them, I just use them carefully and minimize my exposure when possible.

I mean bank vault ... i will edit ... 
Where I came from (Portugal, europe), most bank vaults are on basements! 
I assumed it was standard practice, at least to my untrained eye it seems far more secure.
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:45:17
... aka scare tactics!
Basically its how media and politicians fuck with our heads.
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:02:40
don't get me wrong I love BTC far more for its meaning then for its value, I'm no bean counter!
But, "mathematically proof" its sort of hard,  at most a statistical proof and event that you would have to make up lots of stuff to try to achieve any sort of demonstration!

It gives one the ability to stop the dependency on state issued money that the root of many other evils: banks and predatory debt  among others. 
If your ok with:
* having the goverments of several countries control how much the money you have is worth, or
* paying the banks for "keeping" your money safe, or
*  paying fees to money transfer company to move cash between countries or pay for goods and services 
Than maybe bitcoin is not for you ... just ignore if it bothers you.
But know that the things I mentions can be fight back and there are many people doing it, not only the developers. But all of it was born from satoshi brain, and for that I am grateful.

I like Gavin, he's a nice guy! And I think he does a good job, as a programmer/architect as well as an ambassador for BTC.  
But I dislike dictators, and there for I believe this is a pretty good system, Gavin can publish what he thinks best (and I do trust his judgement, he knows more about the btc network/blockchain then me) and all the miners "vote" if its ok by upgrading their nodes to the new release or not. 
If the day comes where he his coerced into doing something harmful for the btc community some one will call it out and we can collectively act and force a bitcoind code fork and place it on good hands. 
For now if he says that, larger blocks that will increase in time,  is the way to go ... I say go for it. And I thanks Gavin and all the other developers for their work in improving the scalability.

How about two papers in two safes? preferably geographically separated: different cities. redundancy rules!
Also, as previously stated laminate the paper. And as an extra step (expecialy if it is a basement safe, eg bank safe) keep every thing in a tupperware of some sort

I meant really big crash ... over 25% so I'm talking about the last november and and this last one (early february) ... the rest are just market variation and I dont think they can be put the blame on a single party (IMHO). 
@_date: 2014-01-30 10:32:01
Well he might know someone with the private key and ask them to sign it ... not knowing the key him self. I guess he may be "forced" to sign in front of a trusted party.

* Banks vaults are usually in basements
* Basements are prone to flooding
Suggestion: keep your paper wallets inside a water proof container, probably something like a tupperware.
