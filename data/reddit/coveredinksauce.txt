I've got 1 btc here for the first bitcoin satellite 
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:24:23
Price quietly jumps 80%.  Then falls 8%. Then jumps 14%. Then falls 12%. Then jumps 10%....
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:31:52
If you want, I can make it easy on you.  Just send me a check and I'll get you all set up.  Actually....cash only.

Buy! Buy! Buy!

Yea but my s5 gets over 24 hours of battery life and is lightning fast.  I'm sure even if everyone  that had the malware had an s2, it would be pretty good for them considering the numbers.
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:51:55
Got it on my first try!
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:17:45
Well fuck me running.  Touche kind sir.

It's not just that, but it seams like most polls are like this.  Should read "34% of Britons surveyed believe that bitcoin is the currency of the future"
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:19:23
I feel as if everyone values their product much more than it's actually worth on that website..
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:03:00
Curious, In theory, should Bitcoin go up now?
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:57:05
Kudos

Is there any reason to not be logged in all the time?  I believe I've been logged in for roughly 2 weeks now.
@_date: 2014-07-20 04:41:08
Seriously, who?
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:11:17
Someone post the link for the lazy

I feel like it normally takes me 3 days tops.  Hours is stretchin it though.
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:25:49
Sell! Sell! Sell!
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:49:11
This is exactly how I feel too.
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:41:50
I get mine instantly. You have to set up instant buy which takes maybe 3 days, but that's just for security measures. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:08:07
"This is actually good news"
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:26:07
I was considering putting all of my 3 btc into the vault until I saw the picture on coinbase that showed them having 715 btc in their vault.  I'm poor.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:50:21
I have that same remote and mine is for a strip of LED lights.  Mine have been running continuously for about a year now with no problems.
but yea. bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:07:43
Do you really think it will be worth less?
I feel you, but just wondering.
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:29:50

@_date: 2014-09-29 17:45:43
What is the difference between circle and coinbase?
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:11:20
Feels good to finally be int the 2% of something.
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:31:44
I thought "oh boy 10 btc"
I quit after the first line
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:27:36
Just got my first tenth BTC.  Just testing the waters
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:28:33
Is there any reason for them to not go to it though? Like do they lose anything if BTC goes bottom up?
