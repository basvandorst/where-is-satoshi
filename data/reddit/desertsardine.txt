He didn’t invest 1/2 his savings, he invested all and lost half!!!

Why would you post your name on reddit, especially when talking about large sums of money?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:15:45
What’s a minor European country?
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:16:25
I honestly think the majority of the people on here hoping for “lambos” have invested $100... 
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:27:53
Not everyone has to pay tax...

This is my fantasy, to buy a house with only bitcoins... and plant tulips everywhere!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:39:45
I’ll buy another if it dips back to anywhere close to 5k
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:25:45
I’d just sell 50% now and hodl the rest. 750kUSD plus what you already have could set you up nicely for semi-retirement through passive investments. I don’t think I have the stomach to sit on so many gains without realizing it. But congrats anyhow

Bought one coin on Friday for 9700usd. Made 3 grand in 5 days!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:43:05
I get it but when it was 1k people probably hadn’t amassed a fortune big enough to change their lives... at a certain point greed may blind many
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:51
only time will tell!

It's nothing to do with the British, it's to do with the fact that half of the world sits behind GMT, half sits in front... So it makes sense to set the standard as GMT. Otherwise you get folks in Asia having to wait till early evening till they can comment on the daily thread... It's not like this over at r/cryptocurrency and most other global subs.

Correct me if i'm wrong but cars still need a physical key inside it to start (just not physically inserted)?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:32:17
classy, have an upvote
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:47:36
Why sell?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:34:52
me :(
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:13:37
If we're a truly global currency then it should be GMT
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:47:18
Yup that’s what I said
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:40:01
I can’t wait to be in “profit” again!
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:50:18
Even though I'm new to this game, I'm glad for this dip that at least it shakes out all these idiots who thought they were investment geniuses and that their crypto buys would make them a millionaire by next week... We were all warned that this shit is volatile, we were all warned it would crash (and then recover), how are people so fucking narrow minded and short sighted? Like 3 people I know have bought bitcoin, most people don't have a clue what blockchain is, how can you possibly think this is even remotely over... I only wish there was a crypto sub where you had to submit a maturity test to get in! There should be a rule that if you sell your position you can't post. Rant over.

Why does this thread only come up around 10am GMT?
That's 7pm in Korea by the time they can comment on the daily thread....
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:35:29
I’m not going to say anymore after this but it’s disingenuous to say we have many time zones so we will put it at -10 UTC (midnight in Hawaii) as a best scenario, the vast majority of the world sit closer to UTC as a median. That’s like saying majority of people like the temperature to be read in Celsius so we  will put it in Fahrenheit as a compromise (not a great example)... anyhow the mods explained majority of the traffic to the sub comes from US and Europe so in that case it’s fine and I concede, I’m just personally annoyed to have to wait till 2pm everyday to comment on a daily thread (I don’t want to comment on yesterday’s thread in the mornings even though it may still be active cause it seems psychologically backwards). I just wonder how many of our Asian / Ozzy bros feel the same... maybe it’s just me. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:21:24
I said it should be GMT which is the worlds Median time...
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:05:00
The new buyers we see on reddit / 4chan / discord don't mean anything in the grand scheme of things... It's institutional money that will save bitcoin. I'm seeing more and more wealth advisors advise people to put 5% of their holdings in crypto, I'm seeing people get into crypto ETFs. Look it may crash further but I really don't believe the show is over, not even intermission yet.
edit: The more I read these subs I realise that the vast majority of people on here commenting about the state of the market have less than 1k USD invested...The future of bitcoin or any alt will not be determined by reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:16:25
Maybe this is something the mods can fix... I'm at +4GMT but I can only imagine how irritating it is in NZ at +12, it's practically 8th of February when they're allowed to comment on the daily thread for the 7th...
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:26:52
Unless you’re a kid, not really 
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:21:27
It's already Feb 8th in 90% of the world including Eastern US / South America and we're still commenting on 7th Febs daily thread... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:24:59
Nah man, I believe it because I can look at a chart. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:57:07
I don't but I do know it has every other time and that we are far from mainstream...
