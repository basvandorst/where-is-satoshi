You must have lots of friends. Just not on Reddit.

Wow, you are a real piece of shit! I think I speak for most when I say "Fuck you with a flanged mace".

You're making lots of friends on here already. I'm just giving some feedback that would help people view the Bitcoin community in a better, more serious, light. Polarizing comments like yours aren't very welcoming to outsiders. Judging from the recent comments you've made on this site, this is a pattern.

Just skimming the bill it almost looks like they want to categorize Bitcoin as a viable investment and therefore taxable. If I understand this correctly then I would not be okay with that bill. Regulation will only bring more problems given Bitcoin was never meant to be regulated by the government but to regulate itself within the community and developers. That is, IF, I understand correctly.

Nothing like that but it defeats the purpose of having a VPN if you can still be identified. Thank you.

"TO THE MOON" "Bitcoin worth 10k by 2017!"
Anyone who takes Bitcoin seriously or anyone seriously considering Bitcoin will be put off by this kind of speculation. Hard to take a currency seriously when the most vocal people in the community are trolls, memers and internet lawyers/investors. Aside from all of that, the technology is worth more than Bitcoin itself.

I'm sure the majority see it as a joke but when outsiders see this they don't get the (inside) reference. It just makes them raise an eyebrow and discourages them from putting their money into the market. Of course they may have already made a mistake by taking anything said on Reddit seriously but I'd like to think that Reddit is a good place to read about topics and what people think about such topics.

This is correct, unless the company agrees to pay the balance of their ad campaign periodically by having the publisher invoice them then they should be pre-paid. Honestly though, paying for internet ad space is a waste of money these days. The click-through rate is awful, fraud is rampant and other methods of advertising work much better than even targeted ads online. Just my opinion though.

You definitely know nothing about investing if you think all investing is gambling.

It's not backed by anything but what someone will pay you for it. That's the free market.
