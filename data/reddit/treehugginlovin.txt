Tell that to someone in Zimbabwe carrying around trillion dollar bills that can't buy anything. Ever heard of purchasing power?

Don't buy at the top of a bubble. Learned my lesson. Buying Bitcoin in the next week... accumulate now, sell at top

It’s not speculative it is history. Rate cuts follow rate pauses. The bubble they created after 2008 is deflating they’ll have no choice but to cut rates when the recession hits. The yield curve is 50% inverted. A yield curve inversion has proceeded every recession. The Fed will not raise rates in a recession that would be economic suicide.

Bitcoin is money! Sound money.

They are going to 0% The Fed no longer sees any rate hikes in 2019. They’ve paused hikes since December 2018. Rate pauses proceed rate cuts. They are going to 0% heck maybe even negative.

It is a speculative asset class at the moment fueled by human psychology. Human psychology fuels bubbles. Learn this and Bitcoin doesn't lose value. Buy low, sell high!

Feels good to buy Bitcoin at $4K I will not be the 95%

It is trading algorithms in Asia that are behind the bcash rise. Zerohedge wrote an article on it. An institutional investor would never put money into Bash.

It's eerie to use that name ....

Are any of the people complaining about him posting a picture of his daughter parents themselves? I'm a mother and I think it is fine when responsibly done. People post pictures of their kids all the time it is not a big deal. He's not posting her school address or anything  sensative like that.

Nah, our government is delaying it again. At this rate it will be legal by 2020 if the government keeps delaying it. Right now it is medically legal but recreationally nope.

His reddit name is Luka Magnotta- Luka was a murder in Canada who killed a man and broadcasted it live on the internet. I am not sure how to feel about this ...
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:41:20
But the last name "Magnotta" how common is that ...

He's not an expert

Ownership. Google about cryptocurrency wallets. I recommend that every newbie understands wallets before purchasing crypto. It is not your  Bitcoin if you don’t own the private keys. Right now that Bitcoin &amp; Eth belong to coinbase.
