you only need 1 bitcoin if it takes off.. I've bought and used many but I have 1 physical BTC and 1 GBTC that I hodl till the end.. If it happens the way satoshi describe 1 is all we'll need.

there is no competitor to bitcoin... bitcoin has the biggest fucking moat in the history of moats.

it use to be great at this.. I've been hodling and mined myself since bitcoin was less than $1... I could send transactions fairly fast for a reasonable fee. My question is where is the value in the platform if i can't even do what it fundamentally was built to do? Why is it a 4k coin?
I haven't touched my coins or bothered with a BTC transaction in over a year.. I just don't see where the value is coming from when i can't even perform the basic function of bitcoin.

best answer yet.. this seems like a problem.. or a feature? i guess it depends which team you're on.

I'm angry because I love bitcoin and own a lot.. I use to make a lot of these small transactions.. Bitcoin was advertised as the savior of micro transactions on the internet and its not able to perform that function in even the slightest way.. unless you're sending very large transactions there's no point.. I've been hodling since about $48 and haven't sold since... but this 4.2k price with a fundamentally broken network seems well fake.
I'm just not so sure anymore when I attempt to use it, and it literally doesn't work for small transactions. I'll be completely honest, I quit looking at bitcoin about a year ago and haven't really kept up to date w/ it like I should have been probably.

Low fee? I paid almost 1/9th of my transaction in fee's.. 50 cents on $9 is now a "low fee" its a low fee in todays broken bitcoin platform... You can no longer do low cost micro transactions with bitcoin.. that's what is broken... should i have paid $3 on a $9 transfer to get it processed? That's fucking broken and if you think that's ok you're a fucking moron.

so now bitcoin is only good for cars or houses? What happened to saving journalism as we know it? And uh empowering content creators, and all that fluff?
