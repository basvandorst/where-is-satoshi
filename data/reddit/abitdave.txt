The keys are created by a secure trusted third party.  Each address created is loaded with a small amount from my address.  Anyone who tries to create a look-a-like can simply check the source if a payment was received from my address.  The private keys matching the public keys is taken care of by the secure printing company.

I agree, but the use of sites like bitaddress requires a level trust for those not fluent in code or cryptography. You could explain the whole process step by step but there is still a possibility of the keys being stolen or compromised no matter how good you are at security.  Granted the process I follow has a risk which is infinitesimally small but no matter what way you look at it a level of trust is required.  We can only take steps to minimize the risk but it's impossible to create a 100% secure paper wallet.  A bit off the beaten track now but I appreciate your feedback. =)

Thanks for that! my bad for writing "1 satoshi" which is why i wrote "a minimal amount" in the step by step process.  The reason for this is that each wallet will be loaded with a minimal amount from my address which I will make public.  For anyone trying to create a replica, you can easily scan the public key and see if a transaction has been made by my address to verify its authenticity.

Bitcoin does not rely on trusted third parties, however, bitcoin can through applications on top of the Bitcoin network.

Yes, they are great and I've one of these myself.  This idea is to provide a simplistic entry level to Bitcoin with practically no effort on their part and at a fraction of the cost.  No one would, or should, trust a paper wallet from anyone unless they can provide sufficient security guarantees which I think this idea can fulfill.  This is certainly not for anyone here, but the for the general public I think it can work.

Not sure why the length of my account has anything to do with the idea.  The reason i'm not exactly forthcoming with company details as of yet is to keep this for my launch at which time their credibility can be assessed.  Based on the information i've provided any suggestions would be welcome.

Good point. I would argue, however, the obtaining of bitcoins is a lot easier using something like localbitcoins or an atm where a simple scan is all that is required.  I'm based in the UK, having spoken with a solicitor he cannot see any potential difficulties I could run in to and has given it the go-ahead, should I proceed.

So reputation and established credibility along with the highest standard of accreditation is not enough?  I'm a tad confused by this, is there a way to generate private keys that does not rely on trust for an individual who does not read code or have a full understanding of cryptography?

Using a trusted third party accredited by ISO standards whom have been established for years which will then sign off on the process removes the necessity for placing trust in me. Cheers though!

UK, solicitor has given the go-ahead should I decided to proceed.

Thanks for that, some great points to think about.  The company is audited by the ISO and are happy to sign off on the printing process.  This places liability equally on their shoulders should there be any breaches of security.  Given their high reputation and clientele ranging from banks and massive corporations along with almost 100 years experience, would you not agree this to be sufficient to place trust in them?  All wallets are also mailed from the printing location.

The secure printing company sign off on the process -  They have been in the business for almost 100 years, audited by the ISO and will sign off confirming the process which will be available online.  They also mail all wallets from their location.  Would you still say that this not sufficient?  If not, why? cheers

Each address loaded will be shown on the blockchain.  Good idea though, i'll simply have a link to the transactions made from my address on the blockchain.  Each batch printed will also be recorded on the BC on the day of printing.
