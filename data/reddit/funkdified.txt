Or ~100x base-model 2018 MBPs using current BTC exchange rate.

Depends on the users IP and number of viewed articles etc

Something like this

Pretty sure this is just a creative way for a non-uber driver to get random BTC tips from Reddit users

Could do Spotify style and pay WSJ .00007 cents per read

Slippery slope to undoing net neutrality imho

Seems like the first step toward turning the internet into a subscription based service like Netflix. Not a fan ...

I was only hoping to start a discussion on the following. Rather than trying to convince retailers to sell in bitcoin, why not attack it at a grassroots level, and start pushing the acceptability of bitcoin into the public domain through online auctions? I do realize that people are already auctioning cars in BTC  ... but I'm using a mainstream website (here in NZ) to put the idea out there.. Now all I need is for some local rag to write up an article about my auction drawing attention, etc etc... and away we go.

Honestly... I am not looking for bitcoin tips or trades... just legitimate advise from honest traders. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:27:13
Yeah, good point. I will change that

Also, I could not find any policies on trademe that specifically state a ban on cryptos

The price difference for a slightly better keyboard, and improved battery life was about 1500 USD. I can carry my charging cable around for that sort of change. Besides, my dual boot Mint Linux and Windows 8 setup is ideal for development (linux) and design (windows)... I have everything I need, and don't feel trapped by iOS

Re: sarcasm, was referring to your last statement. Actually pretty funny. For rate, I would give a better price in BTC than NZD.. Only because I believe the value is low right now.
EDIT to auction: "If you do pay me in bitcoin, I'll give you a 5% discount."

Selling bitcoin and taking payment for items in bitcoin are two different things! I like your sarcasm though. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:01:05
Seriously ...

Look closer... at the bottom of the ad under "Payment details"

I got a 4th gen i7 and 256 gb ssd ultrabook with 15.6" 1080p matte screen from the Microsoft store for 800 USD. This was 6 months ago. Vizio thin and light. Fantastic machine
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:25:45
Cool .. works like a charm

This kind of community support certainly doesn't increase the demand of the bitcoin... You'd think it'd be in the investors interest to help people looking to buy BTC on the market.
