bitcoin is the first of its kind, so yeah its rare for it to be the absolute cryptocurrencie, as technology will evolve and there will be better ways soon or later.
@_date: 2014-06-08 20:35:16
Interesting. So it put bitcoin  in a very diferent class of risk investment, you cant just withdraw in the last minutes.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:19:53
I agree.

Nobel Prize is in most cases (except for Barack Obama) given to scientific challenging or game change inventions or thoughts. All the ones you mentioned are only the remix of previous inventions thus having no real scientific value at all.

Uhm, you can have a wallet for a corporation, so no, if walmart would take bitcoins they would have one wallet for the local walmart, or even on wallet for cashier in case they needed more control.
as for taxes, the prices would have built in taxes.

Sincerely I think this is a good opportunity to see how doable and what would happen at 51% with all the news coverage many powerful people with no much to lose will buy miner hardware just to see how it is. And some of those people are really, really rich.

I don't know! This is something that need to be developed, i don't have that kind of strategy on my mindo to just spit it all here. We have to figure it out.
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:26:24
People forget that BTC is money, and it should be used for your best interest.
@_date: 2014-05-29 10:23:25
 harsh encryption is just a lot of keys, and the fact that the bitcoin algorithm don't let you delete content, how would netvend delete content with copyrights protection for example?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:27:04
seriously? try to explain it to your mum, almost nobody can really get it
@_date: 2014-06-12 12:22:32
How much fee? Just out of curiosity
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:08:46
I didnt say that BTC is worth of a Nobel Prize either. But it could deserve one in economy if it is able to survive longevity and create further positive change in global economy.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:12:32
It would be laborious but if the target was worth it, you could take control over his PC and  if you know he would backup the phone on the PC, you could have a setup to root it next time he connects the USB.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:27:40
Short answer, no.
They will only be entering a market which has the same kind of competition as any other. Their fees and services would have to be good enough so people would use PayPal instead of other services, in the short run it would have much impact since the average Joe would learn about BTC but in the long run it will have no impact in the BTC overall system.

This is a very clear pattern, thanks.

I have been searching about social networks that share this kind of anonymous ideal, and I will point two things one good for you guys and other kind of very bad.
First the good news, based on the readings I have done on many of the social networks that claim to be open source, their major problem is that if the network don't have many users, since many of then are non profit organizations, they rapidly run out of funds so they became without further support and likely die, they don't have any way to monetize, and since it is only one more social network developers lose interest for work free on something that is only a copy of twitter but free software and without ads. The good for you is that the money (or bitcoins) is already the key thing in your system and is built to it from scratch! On that you are probably the first to create a anonymous social network who can monetize without ads, congratulations!
The bad news, been a centralized system you will soon run into criminal activities, when those activities reach law enforcement knowledge you will be obligated to take those activities out and ban it, or close the entire network. even with crypto it is possible to law enforcement to want those keys to investigate, so there you got a big problem, if you can't delete or ban or control the criminal activities government will shut your server down! that's the problem with the central server idea, and also that in theory you won't be able to delete content if you use the bitcoin technology. .
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:24:24
well it sounds very good, maybe they do have everything covered, keep up the nice work, i want to write something to it but i don't know python only java, js or php
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:15:03
Haha! Isn't great that you can just give real money to people by typing a quantity in a forum? That kind of stuff makes BTC such a breakthrough!
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:47:04
yes, that is a problem, but even if it is encrypted the words spread that this service is sharing illegal content, and since it moves money law enforcement can ask to see what is happen, so even encrypted information can raise concern, but that is my over precautions point of view, I don't think anybody would be stupid enough, but it can happen and is bad to anybody involved, but I don't think something like that would happen so soon, it take ages for this services to go to law enforcement ears, so until then we can come up with a solution. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:59:04
Actually there is not much difference, because if your device is from a known brand, it can easily be "hacked" or even rooted from remote, devices with more unknown sources, like some Chinese ones are more likely to be safe since the drivers for it aren't available, and a generic ADB will most likely not work.
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:35:03
That is probably the case where even banks are still thinking and taking small steps. As bitcoin wont be a direct threat but it will sure give people other option that never existed before. 
When people argue about a free life we end up talking about how we cant be free because of banks. There was never another option. This can slowly change the status quo, and in some time not as a direct threat since banks have the financial power to take a chunk of BTC. But a threat in the mind. This seed is far more dangerous in society, just look at how we changed since the first smartphone.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:30:21
I understand the concept, but some things have to be done for the good of others and for the long run. Having a consensus in society can be healthier in projects that expect to survive longevity.
@_date: 2014-07-10 07:30:42
thats a very unhelpful comment on if the video is any interesting to you, but yeah who doesn't like a pretty face anyway. And hey look! There are pretty girls talking about bitcoin, isn't it somehow good... 
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:14:09
I'm looking to buy at today's price, the way bitcoin was built and the success it is having, there is no way it will stop at 700$ we are only at 12m bitcoins, there is a hell of  ride to go, and prices will just get crazy by demand that is being created, so much good new etc, the thing is, anyone that has at least 2BTC will be  a millionaire in 5 to 7  years due to adoptability by big companies and how easy it will be to use bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:46:21
yeah that is my point, since it will be easy to setup a server and since it is a commercial and social application, taking down one server by law enforcement means that people who made deposits will lose their money and thus making Netvend untrustworthy. And people who put copyright content or criminal content will most likely encrypt it, its not very difficult to understand my point in the very first post.
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:27:49
I agree in many things, mostly that  the major benefit for BTC is that dont matter how much you have you can go anywhere with it.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:03:50
My post is exactly on the contrary idea of given power to the minority, what I was trying to say is that, some kind of system have to exist,  so we can still have protection under law. A decentralized system of voting, where everyone has the same power, based on a non trust digital system, eliminating the need for thirty party control, I don't understand where my comment approves the need for leaders or nominations. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:05:59
W0000t? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:14:26
BTC is money. And a kind of money that have no frontier. It is very profitable to bankers the fact it can be sent anywhere any time, and with close to no tax. Its paradise for some kind of transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-30 00:29:29
...the solution to delete or hide content that are copyright protected so you don't need to shut down your server? you really mislead my point. and the only reason TOR is not pursued by law is that they are created by the US government as stated in their website and second because they are a NPO, even TBO who is also a NPO is taking down every time they have to use a new domain,  do you think a service who is based in the use of crypt-currencies will not be investigated? .......
you clearly don't understand law and government at all, if this application want to scale it will be a thing to think about.
@_date: 2014-05-29 00:31:15
well that is how a developer will see it, but lawyers and judges will only see a service that can't provide the crypto keys they need, so they will target the service directly as it always happen.
@_date: 2014-06-06 13:19:14
I agree too. The demand is the most price driving factor.
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:40:40
This is so thrilling! Im just a 'js/php and others' webdev kind guy myself and I'm not a crypto genius like yourself but I can tell that in the past years of social networking this is one of the most exciting ideas I have seen on the internets. Seriously, even that it still in development and don't have a user friendly interface yet I can think of a billion ways it can work. I have a project on some kind of social features that might work just great on top of Netvend, the fact that I will only be paying for the amount of data that i actually use on the server to develop on top of Netvend is also something that makes me very amazed to embrace the project! And many opportunities can come from it receive instant feedback from community in form of real income, I will get into Python very soon so I can try some code on top of that! 
The only things is that I'm a bitcoin newbie hahaha Lets see how it will workout!
I will be following it very close, expect some code of my, not for this contest, but very soon! I wish you guys the most excellent!
 
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:22:59
Makes no sense to boycott. They will keep finding BTC and can still self support at this point.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:56:07
Its not t up to satoshi. BTC is open source decentralized, the only way a new code can be accepted is if majority of miners start using it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:15:49
The only reason someone would do a 51% is to actually put in danger the Bitcoin businesses as a whole, losing his money in the process due to low prices of BTC, only people interested in doing it are banks or Intel agencies.
