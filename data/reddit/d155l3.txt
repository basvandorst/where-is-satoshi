The fact that bitcoin transactions use so much electricity due to miners, plus insane transaction fees ($100+ the other day) means that there cant be a mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. If its lucky, it will stay as a sort of digital gold and store of value as it is now.
It blows my mind that BTC use cases are declining, yet its value is rising due to network effect alone.

Good post and I agree overall. I definitely believe that crypto will overtake gold in future. But in order to get there we need real world use cases, and I don't believe Bitcoin itself will never get there.

Transaction fees spiked over $100 a cople of days ago. The network is barely usable.

I don't believe Andreas had a solid argument about bitcoin power consumption apart from, other industries use more power. He didn't address the main issue which is to do with miners profiteering at the expense of everyone else, and the per transaction power consumption is off of the charts.
Imo there is a really fundamental problem with the system and it was never designed to run at the scale we are seeing today without radical overhaul.

Thank you for this! Extremely useful
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:21:16
Perfect,  thanks all for the info
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:43:30
Awesome thank you for the links, greatly appreciated.

I assume it's /s

I've ordered my ledger wallet so fingers crossed coinbase will hold up until it arrives :)
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:27:06
My coin is currently sat in Coinbase and I understand I should move it on ASAP.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:36:16
How long will we be waiting though? And if prices are likely going to be affected, why aren't people selling now so they can rebuy when the price bounces back with the renewed confidence in the currency having overcome this obstacle

I expect the term altcoin will not really mean much and die out in a  post-bitcoin era. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:19:52
I decided to go for the nano

Feeling dumb that my bitcoin longs are in euros... 
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:49:48
Their total holdings are €3.5 billion so its still a huge amount if you're correct about the 0.03%.

Bad question to ask in r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 12:49:59
I have done this, but it has taken them some time to get back to me. No reply from them so I thought I would post here.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:26:24
 Just look for the coins that are gaining the most adoption. There aren't many, and btc isn't one of them. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 12:52:34
Hmm this is good to know.. I have been using BitBargain and have found it very easy, if always slightly expensive. 
I'm looking to purchase a few coins however so maybe worth the extra headache getting started. Paying one £10 charge to your bank but then saving £10 per coin going forwards, surely thats not too bad?
@_date: 2015-11-11 18:21:49
Oh fair play must be the android app then. Under settings and account options i simply don't get the verification option... quite annoying 
@_date: 2015-11-11 15:32:33
Did you do the ID part through the app or the main website? 
@_date: 2016-05-18 07:44:44
LOL. things that will not happen

Funny thing is that if you took their advice you'd have probably tripled your money at least
