Agreed. It still blows my mind when people don’t understand stock splits and think the company is giving free money away suddenly.

An understanding of how markets work. And Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-17 12:24:17
Hey hey heyyyyyyyy
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:59:24
No but you can use it to buy beets!
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:30:57
But the money that gets worn out gets replaced by the Fed, not lost completely.
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:17:54
What’s happening
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:17:32
You can’t predict whether Bitcoin will go back up based on past data — that’s a fallacy. Same goes for stocks. You can try to find patterns, but short of seasonal trends (which markets already account for in the price), it just doesn’t work.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:25:12
And also actually spending Bitcoin instead of hoarding it! It’s not being treated like a currency, it’s being treated like an investment vehicle. If it isn’t highly liquid and isn’t being spent, we’ll never get to the point you mentioned.
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:15:37
Because most people who post here saying they’re buying the dip aren’t actually buying the dip.
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:15:28
Except that they could trade it for another crypto or fiat currency at a moment’s notice, so they can afford for it to fail
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:38:53
Yeah, except advertising reaches the average consumer and gets them interested in crypto — which increases demand and drives the price up, right?
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:22:16
No because folks are not right. If it was that predictable, nobody would make any money because everybody would be making money.
@_date: 2018-03-07 02:17:02
That’s a lot of animals there.
@_date: 2018-03-16 23:29:44
Be careful, I have a friend in Germany who was robbed of $4k doing that after successfully doing it for a while.
Just meet in a very public place.
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:26:32
I thought what you wrote was interesting and thoughtful; thanks for taking the time to write it.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:53:32
Like with a gun
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:09:54
What if.. we're all Satoshi, man
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:31:23
HEY HEY HEEEEEEEEYYYY
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:50:52
Did you just quote Buzz Lightyear?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:02:36
That’s not irony! It’s all market economics baby.
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:00:33
$4k in cash — they definitely could’ve done that, but I don’t think it was a Bitcoin-savvy thief. Just a regular one looking for the cash. This was 2-3 years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:25:38


No you don’t. The Dow, and stock market in general, is overvalued and a correction is due (it got one today, and probably more tomorrow), but a “major correction” will be bad for you — for your job, your family, your friends. Put Bitcoin aside for a minute and think about that; a correction in Bitcoin is bad for you, but a big correction in the Dow will be bad for all of those around you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:07:36
It will definitely affect your country’s stock market.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:37
No you're not.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:14:07
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:33:00
They should’ve done that to begin with — without it, anyone could file for that trademark and demand that Electrum stop using the mark. This is exactly what happened to RetroPie, except that the guy who registered it hasn’t demanded that RetroPie stop using it (yet); probably because it’s in his best interest to not demand that. Anyways, always protect your marks!
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:51:31
Ok good to hear!
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:35:07
Tell them about the future of cryptocurrency of course!
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:47:16
Hey, I can pay my mortgage with those “fake dollars”. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:06:38
And very full of BBQ.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:08:13
But what about the quarter waxing and waning Fibonacci seashells?
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:48:02
Very true! :) But the Electrum devs would incur legal fees to prove prior use, right?
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:25:27
Right, well, "nonexistent money" or not, a big portion of it is paid off and I end up with land and some nice buildings that have gone up a lot in value.

    Citation needed
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:40:34
It has meaning to its current value.
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:07:05
Wouldn’t it be better if it went up instead of down though?
