that happened to me today as well. took about a hour to get my coin
@_date: 2016-04-16 13:25:55
ha, yes, I mean coinbase.com
@_date: 2016-04-16 19:07:31
I move my coins onto my trezor immediately after I buy them. I have 100usd of bitcoin on CB for my Shift card. That's it
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:53:01
Didn't this affect UQUID as well
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:26:58
Can't buy the dip every day
@_date: 2016-04-25 14:01:25
I thought attempting bitwage at my job. is it hard what exactly needs to happen?
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:39:34
How do they handle for new addresses and thing like that. Are the buy rates pretty decent?
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:57:55
Not really, it's been hanging tight 
@_date: 2016-04-16 13:26:59
I'm not sure how else to acquire bitcoin don't worry though I only have 100dollar worth of bitcoin on there. I move all my stuff off into a trezor
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:32:00
Oh wow, awesome. I didn't think it was that easy Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:11:55
This every one my FB that bought their first 50usd of bitcoin in the last few months
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:19:26
So forget about Japan then?
@_date: 2016-04-16 13:25:28
Thats what got me. I had extra money and I was like fuck it I"m going to buy another coin. I pressed send and they asked me Where I work at, what do I do and Why am I buy bitcoin. I'm like wtf is this
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:25:25
I put money, I know its a pump and dump but I can make a lil money off of it at least. I'll just put the profits back into btc and keep the orginal 4k and maybe put it somewhere else. I bought in 
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:52:02
Where is I figured I've would have seen him at least once or twice in the past few days
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:36:10
...but I've been talking to bitcoin / cryptocurrency experts from around the world though
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:18:59
I don't know about all that but I bought some dip this morning
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:06:07
They doubled charged me 2x and later took out 10usd for a new shift card that I never received. fcuk Coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:06:01
Pretty funny
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:16:22
Have you tried Delta? I used Blockfolio but Delta seems to have way more exchanges
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:33:32
All this new uneducated money coming in is killing it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:09:24
With out a doubt. I have friend that's in crypto and he has the weakest hand ever. Every time it goes down, the sky is falling. The he sells btc into some other crypto. Then it fails and he just bounces around. I'm like dude, just chill. Let btc do its thing. These things happen in everymarket
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:16:46
I love my trezor. I want to get a Model T but....
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:07:59
I was listening to some Salsa and Bachata music video and I saw this ad and I got really mad. I actually listened to his whole spiel. It donned on me this is the 'The only thing I love more than these cars are my books' guys. Can we just buy his ad space out and replace w/ Andreas A short. This guy just tryes to profits on the people that don't actually know whats going on and what in on crypto. It's @_date: 2017-12-01 16:18:03
I wish I could do that. I got denied for bitwage :(
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:53:50
I've been glued since bitcoin hit 1k, the second time
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:59:27
I can't run a full node. I'm always on the road :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:26:16
Use Authy. It accepts its own 2fa and Googles.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:56:21
Hide the pain
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:57:28
Yes but Delta doesn't have downtime issues like blockfolio. Can't add transactions, charts or process are off. Not to mention Delta has for more thing pairs and exchanges to pull from
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:14:46
I've been advocating for Btc on my fb for like years. Ever since it crossed about 8k, I've seen a huge uptick. I have people that I hadn't spoken to in a long time asking me how to get started, word is out
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:10:56
I don't know who youre carrier is but maybe you can buy a chip where you are and get your old number and use that. Idk, it's a possibility
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:18:28
Google hangouts, it ties to your number over web
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:31:37
I put away anywhere from 20 to 35%. Its paying dividends
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:11:36
I'm sure you've seen the ads before
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:51:58
Speaking of cold side, I had a limit purchase order last night. I need to get my coins off gemini
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:51:53
You very well could be right. But I did it so long I don't really remember. You can still try though
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:38:13
Didn't budge
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:51
I was thinking the same fucking thing. I was happy but I'm like this isn't normal or healthy. Th is odd. I don't knwo whats going on exactly but I'm skeptical myself
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:00:59
Blockfolio is garbage. Delta is the way to go
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:22
HaHa suckers, I gave up on CB  a long time ago
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:30:21
with 5 dollas
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:39:27
Who buys all these alt-coins. I only ever heard of 3 of them
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:01:40
Which isn't hardly enough yet
@_date: 2018-08-27 19:33:05
What exactly is happening in this bitmain saga?
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:04:06
You'll just go crazy
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:50:14
Not until I get TO THA MOON!
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:23:51
Doesn't this defeat the purpose of crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:23:51
I prefer coinlib.io
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:26:19
Great post. It answered most of my questions.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:00:37
I live in Dallas, this good news
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:38:02
Thank you, I never would have done that on my own
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:50:51
How you determine the cost of goods or services int btc with out comparing it to another major currrency?
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:03:01
I can't get this right for shit [sigh]

+$.50 verify
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:47:02
Overkill right, for &lt; 500. At at like 5~10k yea but sheesh
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:57:59
How am I worrying, I'm really curious. Like if I wanted to buy something small like eggs or milk. Damn
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:27:37
This works fine, I have a recurring payment of 100usd every pay period and no issues
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:09:51
Its really not worth the hassle for a small amount imo
@_date: 2014-03-15 14:04:49
If it's online there is no way to truly know it is clean. That's the problem
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:54:49
Whats wrong with coinbase? Just because I don't want to buy a mining machine. Coinbase I can simply by my coins and move them some where else
@_date: 2014-03-14 15:20:54
Thanks, I was looking at this yesterday but there wasn't anything i'd buy just in general. I don't want to just spend them for the sake of spending them
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:40:50
Where do I go to scan the public side of my wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:16:01
Thats what I'm asking. Where is the setting, I'm sure what it is I'm looking for
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:30:18
can't. stop. laughing
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:51:19
....Muthafuckin' dogecoins!

Worked for me
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:31:31
Don't keep your btcs on the exchange. Get your funds then move'em somewhere else
@_date: 2014-12-29 17:15:53
I want to move to Ecuador, I'm actually here now. Ecuador has banned bitcoin in favor of creating is own crypto. I read a bit of what was said and it really seemed to say you can't use it for business.
I want to start a small business here, would I be breaking the ban if I accept dollars and then later converted them to bitcoin? Thoughts
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:55:09
I love you @_date: 2014-04-14 19:01:07
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:34:18
I never thought about it that way before
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:45:40
A while back I considered moving there, man. I feel for you bro. Where in the states had you thought about moving to in the states?
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:21:22
I've had CB for 2 year and for all this year to my Trezor? Is there some way that my address can get into the mix that'll get me in trouble
@_date: 2014-01-11 15:55:12
Woudn't that make bitcoin un-usable long term because eventually there will be no more?
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:48:52
+.5usd verify. You're right, practice makes perfect. I need an offline comp and a dumb printer. The plans are in the works but not implemented ye
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:57:21
I don't know whats going on
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:34:03
I'm still mad about that, all mine are Master. Honestly having instabuy is irrelevant so long as you get the coins at current market value, which they do
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:08:28
Thanks for the easy explanation. $5
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:25:55
It was a weird angle and after the 2nd try it read. Nice watch too
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:54:31
I might have to take you up on that :D
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:14:48
Well I wish it would have dipped BEFORE I bought, not after
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:58:41
I'd like to do this since I'm trying to learn spanish
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:05:09
can we stop these if bitcoin goes &lt; x, I'll do y please
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:53:02
I have a trezor connected to Mycelium. How does mycelium know what address to check if the private keys aren't ever sent from the trezor?
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:56:05
Did it work?
@_date: 2016-03-16 18:46:37
Love my trezor
@_date: 2016-03-17 21:43:28
No, right now its a 'read only' thing but seeing as how my coinbase is already linked to buy bitcoins from that account it's helpful
@_date: 2016-03-17 20:07:19
I already linked my account to Coinbase, it's pretty cool
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:31:43
really trying to delegitimize us huh
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:35:26
I guess you lost me. I used real words so how am illiterate?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:15:05
I didn't, Winkdex auto refreshes every minute or so. Just got lucky 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:51:11
I blame Insanoflex
@_date: 2016-03-16 19:08:56
This is interesting news and I bank w/ USAA. I just finished linking my accounts. Pretty damn cool..Only pity is I move my BTC off as soon as I buy it to my trezor
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:02:15
Another good reason to own bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:25:06

@_date: 2018-06-23 18:41:16
This quote is retarded and taken so far out of context it doesn't make any sense sometimes
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:18:26
...speaking of, where is ToThemMoonMan guy?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:22:15
I used for all of a few days before heading to gemini
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:03:39
Been hodling steady for 2.5 years, No fear here. I woke up this morning laughing at whats going on and bought more
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:42:06
Wait until you get to the point where you are making 10000+ when the market moves
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:45:48
I've done some alt research and the only one that catches my eye is IOTA. I've put money in that but the rest of them I really don't care for
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:55:27
Yea man its weird. Since really getting into I was reading really trying to learning it. It's interesting. I'm not worried about correction. One is for sure about due, but I've been there for a while. Like he first big dip back in Oct 2014
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:47:10
I hate coinbase becasue they screwed me out of quite a bit of money . The last time Got a shiftcard becasue my other one was compromised. They charged me but never sent it. That was the last straw for me
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:40:10
@_date: 2015-07-11 16:05:56
C'mon, I'm just messing around. reddit be serious though
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:39:11
Right now it's still simpler to tie it to bank to get fiat right?
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:35:36
I'd love it if Hipmunk accepted BTC, but yea we still need a lot adaptation first
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:52:19
I sent them the coin no personal info or anything, it was great
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:33:30
Then don't worry about buying one, if it's not worth the investment for you. simple
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:44:08
To use an exchange, to convert btc to currency

"I downvoted the changetip bot"
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:34:49
I didn't' want to come across as bragging but it was 1300
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:55:22
I wish btc was legal in Ecuador
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:02:07
I'll there whit you soon brother
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:23:08
This crash isn't that bad. Cheap coins again, best time to buy
@_date: 2015-07-13 01:40:33
I don't think I can agree with you. I bought multi city tickets to Colombia and Ecuador and I payed 1300. Which sounds pretty regular regardless of the carrier
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:10:04
I did the verification. But there is no need to verify for 618 dollars. It was 1.22 and 1.49 or so. It was until after the initial verification that I got charged w/ 618. but there were no pending charges for coin in my account
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:17:10
I didn't know you had Moon Rockets too
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:51:10
Hodler from the beginning
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:49:28
I'll agree w/ you in that it far more equal now than previous.
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:14:53
If you're white you can
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:51:28
My CC was expiring and I added a new one and this happened. I should have checked the link closer or something. I honestly don't know 
@_date: 2017-04-15 12:41:15
no it wasn't. I made no purchases in that amount on that day @ all. All my purchases from coin base just say 'coinbase' Also I don't live in the UK, Coinbase is based out of Cali here stateside
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:58:26
Thanks. I also need to step away from it. Let the dust settle a bit
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:01:04
I love to be optimistic too about btc and crypto as a whole but things haven't' been looking to good for the last 3 months
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:49:56
No more..please
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:05:02
Where can I find the form in Turbo Tax, its' 8949 right 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:53:34
Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:49:47
Can we stop, please
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:39:15
It is part investment / risk. Its not a problem, it's reality
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:38:35
Unfortunatly I don't know how to read this chart
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:30:40
Not saying I'm angry but  seeing your investment go down still sucks
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:36:17
I'm putting in closer to 30% and it working out greatly so far
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:51:23
I use WinkDex
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:33:41
You don't just want to block and unblock everything. You need to find the offenders and block them one by one. Esp if it's a site you frequent often
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:24:36
No, it's not hard
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:11:21
yea but umatrix blocks js and pretty much every page uses js. Whether you use react, angular or any other js libraries. Which makes practically all websites usless
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:40:29
I still put money in every paycheck regardless of price. I took out some to buy stuff I want but primary I hodl
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:57:33
Very hard, I feel the same way
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:25:19
What happened to you after they rolled back? I know they why but I  never talked to some who was affected by it
@_date: 2016-10-20 20:16:07
Thanks, I was rather lost about OneCoin
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:21:59
Doesn't appear we're going to the moon today
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:04:10
It has a high learning curve though
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:41:36
@_date: 2015-11-12 11:29:55
That's not what I was implying
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:23:04
This for the 10th time
@_date: 2015-11-11 20:28:29
Knowledge is power. In theses situations, it'd be good to know what exactly you're dealing with.
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:11:40
Maybe a .5 btc for sure not 12 though
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:07:53
I know those feels. I buy .5 coins a week. I invest in bitcoin. I hope it pays out well in the long run
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:40:28
A few bits more to 21. muhaha
@_date: 2015-03-14 21:52:36
I'm at 6 coins right now, I'll be @ 21 very soon I I think
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:38:40
Ouch sorry to hear that. 
My previous was 15k less than what I make now. It also sucked becasue it was ASP.net,VB, an over normalized DB w/ 400+ tables and Peter fucking Blum controls. House of horrors it was
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:45:06
I can do something like this using google maps, but I would like a picture w/ the image location data to verify if it's correct. If the reddit wants
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:25:25
and how!
@_date: 2015-03-25 12:52:43
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:52:19
Always remember your 'AAB's
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:25:22
It appears that's my only option atm. I do have Coinbase but yy check is higher than the max I'm allowed to buy 
@_date: 2015-03-28 16:04:41
I have my 6 so far
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:02:28
OHH, yea they aren't awesome about it, usually done in a few days, when it's least convenient for you. it's like 4/5 day wait just like if you didn't have a CC
@_date: 2015-03-02 13:49:44
I use trezor. i don't know much about the ledger. The biggest downfall w/ paper is making sure your computer is virus / malware free. To restore paper same difference and also you can't sign coins or anything. Trezor you can still send and receive coins but to receive coins you just need the trezor present which is awesome imo
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:40:46
I use CheapAir and BTCtrip often. I do find that CheapAir is usually cheaper but they don't have the flights on certain carriers you may want
@_date: 2015-03-02 14:48:04
I love you to the moon guy!!
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:46:16
It's only been 2 hours. 
I personally thought the price was a bit high for a bumper sticker though
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:43:11
What's a market whale? I have a good idea but I'm not 100%
@_date: 2016-10-18 17:33:35
So why don't they offer bitcoin as a payment option for starters
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:53:12
No man, I can handle 3rd normal, but they were using those super highly 4th and 5th normal forms. Just getting Names associated with phone number was 5 joins. not bullshiting
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:50:33
Well i have my CoinBase aaccount 100% verified and the only fee I ever see is they do charge roughly [1%] ( of the total amount of the transaction

Why do you people say the OneCoin is a scheme? I don't follow other coins, just btc. So I'm 'out of the loop'
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:47:15
No it wasn't sarcasm. The problem is I don't know cpp and don't really want to learn it but I really want to get into bitcoin / fintech.  I think it'd be a lot of fun. The other issue is I can't freaky think of what kind of project I could work on but a block explorer would be a nice day way of getting in to it I think
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:17:57
Dev here, you gotta find place that'll let you make your own creative choices. My previous job was like that. Where I'm at now is far from that
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:47:35
Are these official and been endorsed by ? :)
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:28:55
When is this coming Stateside?!
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:21:40
Buy the coins then immediately move them to an offline wallet. No one should keep their coins online
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:14:01
It's ok, not bad
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:07:18
6 coins
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:17:55
Is that thing even armed at that point? Don't weapons like that has a minimum distance or rotation before they are armed
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:43:42
I use coinbase and then transfer them over to my trezor
@_date: 2015-03-03 13:25:18
I honestly don't think they are that expensive. Especially if you're going to hold any decent amount of Bitcoin. 120 ain't bad
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:10:00
Stop watching the screen so hard, really
@_date: 2016-05-18 15:57:26
My instanta-buy. i'll pass on BTC Jam ha
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:16:33
I'm based out of the US
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:58:43
Here's a lil something to get you going
@_date: 2016-05-16 12:37:44
How would you determine the value of something in btc if you don't the dollar amount?
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:37:49
Would you go as far as to say he'd get 'roasted'
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:22:56
How do 0 confirmations work and why would a business use use it?
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:12:44
really like you Jerseys, I'd like to buy international though :(
@_date: 2016-05-23 11:28:53
Thanks, I'm going to check it out more. It kind of looks like Craigslist
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:40:52
That's a great idea. I want to get into more fintech but wasn't sure how. I can write a block explorer and take it from there. Wonderful idea!
@_date: 2015-03-23 12:54:59
Referring to Coinbase.com, how come I can instantly buy bitcoin but I can't instantly sell it?
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:47:03
I actually went to H &amp; R block and told them I invest in BTC and I made some money off of it. The guy looked at me kind of crazy and said that there isn't anyway to track it moved right on
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:04:19
I liked the pricce when it was lower, since I could buy more btc 
@_date: 2015-03-29 13:42:39
I don't have G's like that ha
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:22:06
I enjoy it there, fun place to me
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:52:27
We're about in the same boat, I'm sitting on 4.5 BTC. I do set some coin aside for just for fun btc spending but I'm saving it. Safe and sound in my trezor
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:17:26
I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:18:37
I'm pretty sad they banned Bitcoin but there still ways around if you have the means at least. I'd like to transact business there in bitcoin but also not break any laws. it's kind of a downer
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:30:44
I don't think I'd trust Holytransaction.com w/ a single satoshi
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:19:42
I've been using and loving my trezor for a while now
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:47:10
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:06:14
Excuse me sir, I worked my ass of for that .34BTC
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:19:31
I bet you will lol
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:11:35
Makes sense
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:58:39
use gyft, buy a amazon / Gamestio giftcard via btc and boom
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:57:22
or Argentina
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:17:35
1) I'm a developer and I'm really would like to start developing for bitcoin, how can I get started?
2) is there a place I can find more detailed look about the block chain and how it works
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:43:17
Whats the point of signaling to signal? Why not just signal?
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:30:44
I keep only a little bit on CB. The shift card is the best for traveling but all my real coin is on my trezor for sure
@_date: 2016-07-08 18:54:52
I'm still using blockchillin, that's my fav
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:20:24
I never knew how to read candle sticks graphs. very informative
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:31:13
My friends invest in Eth becasue it was cheap and gaining pretty well. He was 'late' to bitcoin I guess you cold say. It was already 2500 when he decided to get into crypto. He tried to get me into but I just don't know what I'd do w/ it. No one accepts it as far as I know the only thing you can do is use it to buy btc *shrug*
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:16:55
Can't you just make a wallet w/ a passphrase and move your coins into the pass phrased address?
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:58:20
I think so. I made a 400 purchase and that's what showed up as well
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:12:43
Stopped reading after 'forte'
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:33:16
Jesus, I knew they had went up in price but not by that much. I got mine like a few years ago though
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:52:57
I googled it as well but I couldn't make heads or tails of it. 600 dollars on top of a 400 dollar purchase wtf
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:14:07
Its been low use becasue I have a system now and I use it to mostly hodl. It may use it once every 2~3 months tops
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:10:07
Thanks for the resources!
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:36:06
Why do you decide to keep your coins on an Exchange? as soon as I buy coin I move them to a hw immediately 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:23:40
It' doesn't' bother me, buy the dip. I like it...to some degree
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:51:38
I feel like my money is just gone
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:54:28
Coinbase offers a high value accounts. Could look into that and give that a try. Also gemini doesn't have a limit to it's wire, but most banks have limits to wires
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:32:59
Fine for me
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:55:16
I'm more on the Microsoft side of things but I can do some java as well
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:13:00
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:03:19
I disputed the last time that happened as well then my account was blocked. I'm trying not to jump to a conclusion I paid the 400 so 600 for any fee is ludacris
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:27:02
What other reading would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:44:20
we got JGW over here
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:46:55
Clearly this guy is pretty radical but the links are far more scarier. "The Christian guide to TORTURING your children" da fuq
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:40:52
I'm a seasoned developer, how can I get in on this?
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:13:30
...Developer here, you can also learn the status codes: 
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:36:53

That's a good idea
