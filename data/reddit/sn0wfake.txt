My understanding of all of this is limited but for the Tether is really crash the market wouldn't their holdings have to be like 5%? 
I'm thinking in terms of a run on the banks... If they had say 50% of what they make out, wouldn't it be unlikely that everyone would instantly want to cash out? Our banks actually hold less than that and everything works just fine.
Also I was  under the impression it was the exchanges  giving Tether the cash so they could use tether on their sites?

I 100% agree with the manipulation and bot part. Makes me sick that rich people found another way to steal money from the little people in the tool that was meant to free us from them.
Guess this is why we should all buy and hodl as you never know who you are selling to.

Im tempted to buy, waiting to hear more news from Binance.
Which is where my coins are and they are all fine by the way.

THe current dip.....
I sold at 11700 because e had been in a bull market for over a week and we ate half of the Wall stack holding us back from 12k 
I am now looking to rebuy in at the lowest price I think it will go. 
Usually the lower the better but I in my mind I don't want it to go too low are the large january correction as I don't want it to scare off new blood to the market. 
 like to think the people manipulating the market price(whales) think like this too and therefore the bottom should not be lower than 10200 slow and steady rise. or a flash crash to 9900 followed by a flash rise to 10200
p.s i am as usually rather drunk right now

What I don't  understand  is  how the market can drop so   much when indian accounts for like 1% of the market......

The way I see it, alot have people have lost money and people want that money back.
If bitcoin went back down to 2k there would be a  fuck load of people suddenly thinking shit that is damn  CHEAP! and  then we start going up for a few weeks. people start saying bitcoin is BACK more people  come and well
you know the rest.
I expect this  cycle to happen over  and over until there is  enough money in the  market to stop the large fluctuations 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:54:00
It will come back. I have complete faith. There is SO much money just waiting on the side lines to get into the market. They just want to come in so low they know they won't lose. Thus all the manipulation of the market. 
But for now, its going down
Oh and when i say down I mean overall in next 9 days maybe. Short up from this point then people will take profit and then down

Makes sense. I live in not one of the nicest places in London and most people i get stuff off own bitcoins. Apparently its less tempting for people to try rob them when buying large amounts of their products with cash.

I've been burnt too many times to buy in now.
I was waiting for 5.8 - 6k and missed the pump :*(
Buying in now and suffering another 1k drop would force me out the window of my apartment
