I know many people don't care for Coinbase for various reasons, but I'm slightly new (3 months) to BTC and altcoins and have never had an issue. I could do without their fees, but I also don't exchange much. Runs smoothly for me and I'm happy.

How much did that astrology degree run?

You will find all the answers you need here as we are all astrologists.

Yes, be shitty and not helpful. That's a solid approach.

Examples?

Mine is steady running on Windows 7 as well. Although we apparently have no plans to upgrade. It's a smaller company but we do about $50-$80k a week in services. Our owner/operator is convinced that 1) Every single Windows update is the cause of a slower connection. We actually had to take the time and uninstall 10 and revert back to 7. And 2) "Apple isn't getting MY money". I feel for you. I do.

For someone who is fairly new to BTC, is Coinbase what you would recommend for the hard fork? Or are other wallets offering to split the coins as well? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:39:02
I use it as a wallet right now, eventually I was wanting to use a platform that I felt comfortable buying, selling and storing
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:13:57
Probably not unfortunately. Secure your crypto properly next go around and always remember BTC is a risk that will eventually pay off, but a risk nonetheless.

I was actually genuinely curious. I'm not a snob when it comes to who uses which, but this surprises me. The GM police force doesn't, however lol

Yeah my bad, I made a mistake. Just send it on back.

No argument there. Like I said, I've had nothing but smooth sailing with Coinbase. But if you're going to strive to be  in this market then you have to put 110% into all areas of your services. And I don't think we've seen that. I'm sure we will eventually though, they're a pretty decent team.

True. But I would think with their fees alone that they would be able to afford better resources whether it be new staff, programmers or even a more advanced customer service. They've been steady eddy for me but I see a lot of people aren't so lucky.
