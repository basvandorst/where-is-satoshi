Uh, i see know. English is not my mother tongue as you can probably guess...
So why am I talking gobbledygook? I am by no means an economy expert, just a studend interested in Bitcoin. I just think that the points i mentioned are not really talked about in this community. You cannot take to much out of this "Analysis", as the conclusion is that noone knows what while happen as this is a new and therfore unknown technology. But i also mentioned that bitcoin has not too much on its site for it staying the  currency.
Correct me please if you think different, would love it! As i said i am a layman, so while i might be smart the things i mention in this post might not be.

Edited. Hope it is better now, i just wanted the individual arguments to be kept apart. Anything to say to the content behind the once atrocious formatting?

German 18 yo student. But as i am young, i might also just be in the late kid phase xD
I wrote a school newspaper article in 6th grade, that makes me a journalist, doesn't it?

Mixed sources. I do not remember the exact ones, but some arguments in economy magazines, reddit posts and some ideas/conclusions i conducted myself.
Tbh. i am not a economy expert, just a student interested in economy and Bitcoin. Therefore: **Do not trust me** haha. I am trying to get to know different factors/ pro and contra arguments for Bitcoins future. I greatly enjoy getting to know new aspects by different people. But i think there is a lot of pure bullshit in the Bitcoin discussion on both sides. Most people just do not realize that Bitcoins future cant be predicted and that a rise and a crash can both happen as no one can predict the future just by analyzing shit that happened before.

*Scheiße(i think that's what you intended)
Kids my age/my community have no clue of Bitcoin and economics/stock markets. So that is not going to help me.
"discuss it with kids your age"(=You are not old enough to understand it yet/You do not know anything) is not what comes to mind when someone says "I'll be nice".
Instead you could try to be nice the right way. If you have enough time(You are very active on Reddit, so probably you have), what would be way more fitting, nice and helping would be to correct me and my errors in reasoning rather than just repetitively saying that i am misinformed, wrong or to young to understand it. That would help me, your answer did not contain any real content.
Not saying that i am not misinformed(I guess that I am), just criticizing your way of answering.

So I am not helping??? ;(
Tried to tell the world my opinion and give another view to the topic that nearly never gets mentioned

I am 12th Gymansium(~high school in germany).
Well yeah... You are probably in the right with your point. But "real" "scientific" facts can not really be said when predicting economics, right? I am still relatively new to economics, hope that is an excuse. Just wanted to counteract that "BTC to the moon"-Euphoria
But don't some things in my post still have good aspects? Bitcoin is still not capable of being a good currency, so why should it a atm mostly unuseful currency be worth anything? If Bitcoin is mainly used as an Investment, that also shifts the public view of it and also does not help it to be used more as a currency, when news/media talk about BTC as an investment, not a currency. And there are also not to many reasons why BTC will be the leading currency. If there is a cryptocurrency that is a great currency and also gets lots of attention why shouldn't it replace Bitcoin?
Or am I still misunderstanding alot of things?

I am sorry. But at least I also use it to buy some onions online...
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:46:06
Haha. I told them that i can give them a paper wallet, they wanted me to manage the BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:40:18
 Well I will hold her BTC on my Hardware wallet, she said that she might cashout around Christmas...
**and NO, I am a nice grandson! I have never in my life even asked my grandparents for money, I would never scam them &lt;3**
