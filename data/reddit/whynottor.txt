Bill of materials:

Total cost: $32.20
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:12:54
In my experience, you need as much error correction as you can get - the Bitcoin logo consumes that redundancy.
The background of a bill doesn't *look* busy, but the [eurions]( and the colored silk fibers tend to throw off QR readers.
Please do try it though!  If you resized it so that it could fit it in some bill whitespace, it might work.  Very smexy.

    4. release results to the world, so others can learn from it.
[Open source warfare](
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:59:24
There is, but the [eurions]( seem to mess with most (phone-based) scanning algos.
I'm trying for as few passes as possible - white ink then black would be counter to that design spec, unless there are cheap stamp technologies I am ignorant of.

Take out the tampon and get some perspective.

Didn't realize there would be so many ~~lazy~~ interested parties [in this](
If someone wants to copy it over to imgur for me, I'll update the link.
A pre-inked stamp of this would run ~45$ (converted to BTC at order time, natch).  I'm working on S&amp;H - we'll start with just the USA at this point.
I'll do an initial run (availability: mid-April) if there's interest.
Comments on design / price / etc are welcome.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:59:46
Don't might - DO.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:17:33
It took awhile to perfect - I'd hate for someone trying to replicate this to waste as much time as I did.  :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:35:18
That is a cogent counter, and merited.
OTOH - this exactly markets to the people like me, who are neither fickle nor emotional about these sorts of things.
There are a lot of market segments in Bitcoin - and being decentralized we don't have to appeal to them all all the time.

@_date: 2013-05-09 02:12:52
The QR code will not resolve on a 1$ USD note - background is too busy.  Have not tried other inks.
Even a 5$ is questionable, but I'm still experimenting...
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:03:29
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:00:00
So do it your way.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:54:11
I actually gifted it to a friend with a worthy project instead.  :)
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:04:08
Irrelevant and redundant.
@_date: 2013-05-09 16:10:39
Two, and a jig to keep them oriented properly.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:35:48
That would work exactly once.
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:02:16
Doesn't work via tor, but thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:24:13
* create a stamp-through jig so orientation is standardized and clears any foreground ink
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:16:41
I will consider this, should there be more interest.

Other operating notes:
* use HIGHEST LEVEL of QR code checksum - it's difficult to get this to scan properly as it is

@_date: 2013-05-09 02:14:13
That's funny, because this is only done on the reverse side.  Most people don't even flip a 20$ over, I've noticed.
Still spends like a regular bill.
Most vending machines will still take it as well - they evidently only test identifiers on the front.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:27:28

You didn't get me.

You act like when you deal in cash it's for aesthetic reasons.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:52:46
Traditionally, yes - but they will scan in any orientation.
There are some that scan better due to the bill's background printing - I'm still experimenting with that.
@_date: 2013-05-09 14:51:12

@_date: 2013-05-09 04:23:00
Original tests included that - scaling issues made it a PITA and not cost-effective.
The QR added a touch of mystery I found piquant, with a smooth edelweiss finish.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:09:52
Please do!  Turn the error-correction way up, pre-treat, and make a jig.  Can't stress that enough.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:11:47
Hadn't thought of that.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:17:36


Well, it took a bit more effort than that.  I learned some things about printing technology.  That's worth something to me.
There are no statues of critics - how are you advancing the cause?
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:52:26
The QR code acts as a kind of shibboleth then, doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:44:24
Google "custom stamps" - these can be ordered online for ~$14.
I'd rather disseminate the idea than the product.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:48:33
I understand that.
That's not my demographic.
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:13:49
Uploaded it as an image.
The QR is ~~also rubber~~ laser engraved - they're finicky so make it as large as you can (within allowable whitespace on the bill), with as much error correction as you can.
Edit: actually holding stamps in hand now.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:19:18
Don't forget writing the FAQ so other people can do it and cover my tracks.  That's a thing.  ;)

12.7mm X 76mm for the text.
25mm square for the QR code.
Edit: borked a dimension.
@_date: 2013-05-09 12:47:51
I considered this, or an URL shortener, but figured that might draw unnecessary heat.
It's not about me, or metrics.  ;)
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:07:13
No offense, but you are insanely overpaid - this took me less than 15 minutes to design / order, plus a week shipping.  ;)
