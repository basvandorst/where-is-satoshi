The most serious work on the matter so far.
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:51:10
I agree. But how is their decision done exactly? what is their thresholds/algorithm?
They are causing to the blocks to be full, so that most users will use extra fees...
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:15:08
This is because the network is busy and the blocks are full - u need the send a bigger fee.
Soon the fees will increase significantly and not all the wallets are adjusted. A real mess.

I really like this post.
I worked for a hardware company. They sold the prototype/dev board at about ten thousand dollar, and the production board at 10 dollars. It is a regular thing.
@_date: 2015-12-08 04:32:47
a very bad idea. You take a good thing in Bitcoin and remove it to support more transactions instead of doing the obvious.
This is what happens when you are afraid of hard forks. Bitcoin will be abandoned by the community.  
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:28:04
There are other cloud mining services, which are part of the community.
Please use them.

These technologies can ruin bitcoin:
It makes Bitcoin non-fungible.
A money that is not fungible is a bad form of money.
If you need licenses please use fiat over banks and not bitcoin.
Please stop using these licenses - or our bitcoins will worth nothing.

I don't understand why it spammed the thread?
Because of the changetip messages?
It looks to me like a reddit problem not yours.
Maybe they should just have  a small icon instead of just showing the actual comment.
@_date: 2014-06-14 06:24:44
thank you so much!

where is the payment protocol?

I am not speaking about big-brother government stuff - why not saying the same about GHASH?
We as a community need to demand it from the exchanges the same way we did it with GHASH.
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:05:11
they didn't dealt with in a way that satisfy the community!
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:30:19
Hi - I just wanted to say: "thank you very much for being what you are - very good friends of the bitcoin community!"  
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:38:57
Bitcoin is like the money you know, only better (taken from Meni Rosenfeld). 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:56:59
Bitcoin is not ready yet for the masses - that is true. But if you mine at CEX.IO - it will never be.
Leave the evil and join the good my friend. 
Bitcoin belongs to the entire human race and not to GHASH/CEX.
We must teach everyone a lesson - if  you try to take over bitcoin you will pay.

price manipulation attack by some entity who wishes o destroy bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:25:43
you are so right!
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:26:42
First of all - where is your apologies?
You are the attack we are all afraid of. No one should have more than 30%. You should find yourself another business that is not threatening the Bitcoin community. its as simple as that. 
If you will go any further than 30% - no one will hold bitcoins you fools!
Now you are trying to meet with other players in order to centralize mining?
Go home - sleep on your nose and be ashamed of yourself.
Your success == Bitcoin is gone forever.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:03:18
The harm goes directly to you! You can't escape it.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:40:28
Good answer
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:48:43
They should listen to vitalik buterin, he knows a thing or two
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:52:54
You are so right. I was thinking to drop my holdings if they take over, but decided to fight until the end. Bitcoin belongs to the community and not to central authoroties!!!
People, please, please dont mine at ghash. Dont buy cex.io contracts. We can fight them back. They will lose their investments. We will win our loved bitcoins. This is an hour of a test to bitcoin. We must prove that we are better than monkeys.
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:50:36
Yes - evil!
Those who try to take over bitcoin are nothing else then the dark forces of humanity.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:37:11
+1. IMHO it is the most important invention of our lifetime.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:21:50
The fact is they are doing this now
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:05:34
Mining more than 33% says exactly that - the pool is too greedy. no pool should pass this ratio.
read more in:
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:22:33
The last 24 hours they are over 43%
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:06:25
You are doing a very bad thing - you make Bitcoin a centralized currency. This is very bad. It will make it's price go to 0.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:26:16
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:49:24
51% attack last week by ghash. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:16:16
The community - the same way we do it with mining pools.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:31:17
@_date: 2014-08-30 10:29:56
sorry -you are right - appologies
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:55:25
Great answer
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:39:18
Very well explained. We as a community must make sure that the price will go to 0 if a malicious pool like Ghash.IO  will succeed to take over. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:40:28
Good answer
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:21:06
They will decide if you can spend your bitcoins or not. In your case it is probably not
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:52:20
You guys are awesome! Thank you so much.
As far as I concern - you are the bitcoin foundation.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:26:11
GHASH/CEXIO issue. people don't stupid you know
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:53:38
its their fault - they should stop accepting more members and collect mining fees.
The price will crash because of their behaviour.
No more than 33%.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:47:36
They are going to change the name of bitcoin to ghash.io coin
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:49:58
I know that they sell a great product. But exceeding 33% is not good for for you and the rest of us. Hamburgers are very tasty - will you eat them every day, all day???
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:15:48
I am not speaking about big-brother government stuff - why not saying the same about GHASH?
We as a community need to demand it from the exchanges the same way we did it with GHASH.
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:13:53
I think they are waiting to such posts and lower their rating!
They decided to attack the network.
They are hostile.
@_date: 2015-05-01 14:11:35
He doesn't know what he is talking about. even a small country can destroy bitcoin for the moment.
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:17:31
yes - when they will reach 50% and stay there more than a week - i am going to sell.
no one wants ghash.io coins. We want bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:55:47
They are attacking. This is a direct attack against bitcoin. Bitcoin must remain decentralized ans neutral! The price is dropping because of ghash.io
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:50:05
We are all sure that this has a good taste, so does hamburgers. Hamburgers can kill you.
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:26:00
Those who doesn't want price stability are Bitcoin enemies.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:26:58
Because they are not doing what they said they will do. That is why
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:29:30
He said that more than 24 hours ago. Where is the message?
Maybe the message is that they are now officially took the Bitcoin network hostage.
They don't have a good reputation in honoring what they say. 6 months ago they promised to allow CEX.io customers to mine in whatever pool they like. 
 
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:16:27
They will drop the bitcoin price to 0.
They are hostile.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:35:36
So why do you care about this?
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:37:34
Linux is the most popular OS today - did you hear on Android???
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:11:44
I did the same. Sold 50% of the fiat I invested in bitcoins. I think this is the most responsible action to do.
I never sold a bitcoin before. Even when I knew a crash will happen (Gox, CN), since I don't believe in short rate trading. I thought I will hold my bitcoins until 1 will equal 1 Million dollars.
I don't think it is possible to get there if we will have censored mining. Bitcoin is all about trusting the network and not individuals.
I am considering selling the rest of my bitcoins. I will probably sell them in 2 months from now, if the problem remains.
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:17:03
They didn't took Vitalik Buterin advise. Don't expect everyone to like them. getting more than 50% of the compute power is a very bad thing - it looks like they passed it/going to pass it.
@_date: 2014-08-30 10:30:08
i got confused - sorry
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:34:19
not him, he didn't signed using PGP.
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:43:51
downvote this comment - it will just cause bad rep.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:02:30
let's see. from here to the moon its X KM - i would say we night lose tons of money, if people won't be able to send BTC like they used to, if  they will need to change default transaction fees.
This is bad reputation.
