Lightning network is a "bitcoin secure" way to exchange amounts "off network".  You still have to process a settling transaction to finalise periodically.  But this allows the current amount of transactions being processed to correspond to thousands more individual payments, rather than the 1 to 1 we have today.

I feel at this stage it still got longer to run.   A few selloffs tested but got eaten up by demand flowing in.    A lot of new holders are light though... beyond the next few weeks I suspect even a tailing off of stupendous growth will be enough to spook them.  Would exaggerate any large selloff taking place at that point.  So... might get in the ~~$15k~~ $17-18k region before people start coming to their senses and having doubts.   Decent chance at that point something popping.   No idea if it would come down below today's value... probably a lot of big holders in the wings looking to buy up any dip.    Perhaps means less volatility going forward.   Would expect a lot of jitters when futures are launching..

I've held for a long time.  I've noted down over the last week when I would have bought and sold if I was actively trying to time it.   Got it wrong (or rather less right) than I thought I would, most of the time.   A small additional confirmation for me those feelings are strong and deceptive. 
Make a long term plan, a cap of what you'll buy in each week.  Take some fun in timing the buys (if you're long term hold), but don't attempt to time or feel bad for missing, the dips.

Read their fees page, 0.39% fee might apply on deposit and withdrawals - can't recall but still very good.  From 17/12/2017 only the same flat deposit and withdrawal fees, no percentage fees, transaction fee on exchange at 0.3%.

No matter which way it goes next there'll be a whole ton of people saying "I told you so".
If you're a long term believer best bet probably to spread your purchase in slots over a period of time.   Maybe you'll buy a dip, maybe you won't.   But you won't entirely purchase right ahead of a long dip either..

BREAKING: Madegascar bans bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:51:23
The technology behind it suits it (quite uniquely) as a safe store of wealth similar to gold.    This hasn't been much adopted yet but significant moves are underway to enable it (e.g. approval of exchange traded funds allowing traditional investors worth billions easy access to bitcoin).  Regardless of what price bitcoin is at, the process of large investments buying in will drive it up.  The speculation in the price is a lot of jostling around how likely that investment is, and when, and how much.   It's quite reasonably possible that the amount of investor capital flowing in over the next 5 years will dwarf the speculative capital already there.
Or it's a bit like.. say you were the first discoverer of gold.  And found a ton of it, and found that it was the only source accessible for a long while.  You persuade your friends it's good as a currency (hard to copy, can't invent from thin air) and you exchange bars of it for a dollar each.   Let's say more people find out about the possibilities of how gold is unique and bars starts to go for $10 each.   Then people realise that if wealthy people buy it up to store their large wealth in it will drive the price up to $100,000 or more.   So in anticipation of that your friends and other "early adopters" find it can exchange for $10,000.  
That's roughly what's happening with bitcoin.  Except in the rich people have just appointed regulators and created financial products to make it easier to buy your gold (/bitcoin).
So the speculation has decent foundation...

As there's a fixed amount of bitcoin...additional adoption will push the price up.   Because it's highly divisible there isn't really any practical limit to this.   Speculators who are piling in now are doing so in anticipation of institutional investors adopting bitcoin.   What _that_ happens, then hundred of milllions or billions of dollar will pour into bitcoin over the years.   That will drive the price higher and increase the dollar holding of anyone who buys in about now.   Also to some extent, the use of bitcoin for transactions is steadily growing (but not as quickly as the price).  There are also very promising technologies that will sit on top of bitcoin / the blockchain that solidify the whole technology.
That's speaking to the fundementals.   There's a good deal of the current price that's fluff.   Driven up by people fearing missing out.   They aren't strong holders and a big sell off by anyone looking to lock in profit might scare them enough to shed their holding and flee back to dollars.   If that happens too quickly, or on the back of slightly negative news it could cause a cascade as people panic sell and start talking about "it was too good to be true" etc.
I think the former will certainly happen (institutional investment) and the latter to some degree (selloff - this might even be triggered in 2018 by slower than expected growth - too many people thinking "this is it! - we're at the top of the crest before it goes down").  Price going up quickly = lots of short-term thinking being introduced.  But long term I think the value of bitcoin is sound.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:31:40
instead of buying in one moment, you split the amount you want to invest and buy at intervals over a period of time without looking at the price.   This has the effect of "averaging" the price you bought at over the whole period you were buying in intervals.     So if you buy using 10% of your money each day, then after 10 days you'll have bought in at the average price over those 10 days.    This is used as a guard against unpredictable rises and falls.    It's massivley tempting to buy all in on day 1 for fear of missing out.   But believe me, almost vertical climbs are exactly what markets look like before a moment of doubt and a fall of 20-30% or more.   I'm not saying that's what's going to happen (no one knows) but it's a good reason to spread the period over which you buy in.

Totally supply and demand.
Bitcoin is not "nothing".  It's a fixed supply digital asset that's decentralised and not under anyone's control.  It "fixes" problems that other stores of wealth don't.  For that reason it's attractive to own some.  Some want to buy things internationally with it, some expect it to grow more because of its fundemental attractiveness to big asset managers, some are buying because others are buying (speculation).
So the price is part based on fundemental analysis and part fluff.  The thing is though, that fairly reasonable (in my view) fundemental analysis would put a coin as eventually worth $100,000+.   Quite highly likely there'll be some big ups and downs on the way though.

Many of the arguments for holding gold apply to bitcoin.  Except you can spend or send bitcoin internationally for trivial fees.   The number of places that accept it as payment will only increase for now.   Therefore it's utility as an international payment and transfer mechanism will likely only increase.

The service verifies the seller and holds their bitcoins in escrow until your payment reaches them.  With a bank account using Faster Payments (i.e. most of the major ones), you could have your hands on  bitcoins in about 10 / 20 minutes.
Tends to trade at quite a margin about the spot price on the exchange though (a price for all this convenience).  But shouldn't matter too much to you if you're in for the long haul.
