I believe so.


Yes bitcointalk.org really got hacked by "The Hole Seekers". The message about the FBI "seizing" (lol) bitcoin is obviously joke.

Please share your infinite knowledge of Bitcoin and humour.

Credit to [bbbbbubble]( for the link.

You don't need to do **฿75₥** or **Ł75₥**, that just looks weird. Just use **75₥ BTC**. This is similar to how you would say **75¢ USD** or **75¢ CAD**.

Thanks for the link. I posted [this]( so we can continue the discussion there.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:53:10
I would, but your account is brand new so you have no credibility. If anyone with an established account wants to make me the same deal, PM me.

Can someone please summarize who these people are, what this is, and what it means? I'd like to read the whole thing, but at the moment I don't have the background to understand any of it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:34:13
Thanks for that. I read through most of the leak (including the part you commented), and it's pretty chilling. Do you know if anything has/will come out of this? I'm pretty scared of the senate hearing coming up and all this talk of bitcoin control/corruption.

OP! Use [this link]( so it IGNORES Gox in its price calculations!!!

If he/she hadn't said this I'm sure it would be a lot worse:

When they can still be bribed :p
jk, that's an awesome way of spreading the word.
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:37:54
Oh come on, why does the majority of the tech community always have to rip on anyone who knows slightly less than they do? I thought this was a fine report considering they don't spend hours every day following bitcoin/silk road/etc news and like you or I might.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:47:14
Sorry. +$1 USD
That will be worth a lot one day
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:20:32
I didn't know. Would it please you if I deleted this thread?
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:15:49
Can't help but agree with you on this one... This is some tier truth.
@_date: 2013-11-02 19:24:21
You don't have to type that "m slash thing" unless you want to be technical. On Reddit you might write "I have 10c", but on a banking website they might write "you have 10¢".
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:04:14
Not sure if this is getting downvoted because people think I'm serious...
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:22:24
Yes actually we do. There is currently no good way of addressing a single human independent of gender. In the past it would have just been "guy", but that's changed. Many people are resorting to "they", but that's actually plural and isn't grammatically correct.
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:13:21
In my opinion, the most [terrifying comment](
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:53:18
That's not what he said. He said "are we going to be living in a world where there's several different **types** of currency?". That's a fine question, and he clearly did some research (more than most reporters) and knew about alt coins, which IS a concern for people just getting into bitcoin.
Edit: *knew

I've been saying millibits for a long time.
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:50:12
It says so when you try to visit the subreddit.








@_date: 2013-11-24 03:23:11
Yeah, as far as I know, they're not liable as long as the person says they are over whatever age is required.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:33:04
I'm also wondering where the origin is.
