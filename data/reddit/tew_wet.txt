They also put asbestos in their baby powder and when it was revealed that asbestos was highly cancerous they decided it would be better to leave the asbestos in the powder and try to cover it up.

@_date: 2019-11-24 18:41:58
You should be grabbing satoshis and the goal of the game is to finally get one bit coin. And then when you do your character busts a  fat nut.
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:57:13
It'll be back up. This time of year people tend to sell more.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:34:50

We know these roads. In fact we built these roads.
@_date: 2019-11-17 01:12:10
WHY DO MY EYES HURT

@_date: 2019-10-25 16:47:43
That's not true. It should be just as safe as a personal wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:58:01
And its back over again
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:52:49

Why didnt i buy when it hit $3500. Oh pepehands. Ive only ever bought in at right below 10k.
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:33:20
If the world ever hopes to improve we have to get these terrible people out of power. Why are leaders driven to be so corrupt?
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:51:35
Yeah i wish
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:38:12
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:40:39

@_date: 2019-08-28 03:50:49
Just wait til bitcoin hits the 20k mark and keeps rising. You won't mind those memes then
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:57:24
Oh yes you will
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:02:59
BITCOIN IS A LIE. WE'RE ALL CHASING THAT FIRST BIG PEAK BUT IT WILL NEVER COME AGAIN. ��
@_date: 2019-10-21 19:12:35
Also 300 aint crap in the grand scheme of things. There's probably more than 300 people doing this in any major city.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:39:11
Whats coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:01:31
I must be doing it right then
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:38:45
I watched that documentary on McAfee. Dude has lived a crazy life.
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:46:06
A singular currency will never exist. Would be nice but aint gonna happen on this planet.
@_date: 2019-10-05 02:32:27
Teach me. I know something about block chains.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:29:40
Oh shit that's coming up. Ill just do no shave November instead ��
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:09:05
If that happens I'll buss a nut
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:08:04

@_date: 2019-06-29 21:47:15
Waiting for 2k. Pepehands
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:58:02
I bought it at 10k before it fell all the way down.  Fml
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:40:58
I never thought about that but using art to launder money seems like a great idea.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:54:14
Even with inflation ill take that
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:02:07
@_date: 2019-12-08 04:03:50
Do you honestly believe bitcoin would ever replace banks. I just dont see it
@_date: 2019-12-23 14:33:17
I noticed the typo right away and was like hmmmmmmmmm
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:11:54
Up, down, up down, up,  down. Pick one btc
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:55:06
I use coinbase. User friendly, easy to get started and buy, online wallet. I know a lot of these guys are paranoid and use their own electronic wallet but i dont think it's completely necessary.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:20:56
You mean 3k ��
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:24:00
I WANT TO BELIEVE
@_date: 2019-09-12 03:40:14
You're either getting paid by Elon to write stuff like this or you just really want a Tesla.
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:40:43
Is it a new unreleased character or something?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:34:02
Im holding for at least under 8k
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:34:06
I don't have google on my computer
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:31:47
What is bakkt
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:53:19
Yeah but bitcoin coudbe down 50% tomorrow or up, hopefully.
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:31:35
Ive never heard of this? Whats this reward?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:20:23
But how soft will this boner get is the question
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:00:17
200 iq
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:28:21
Maybe when I'm old and gray I'll have doubled my investment.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:42:06
Dats rite mane.
@_date: 2019-09-14 04:35:57
I guess i really dont understand mining then. I thought miners are the ones who processed bitcoin transactions and got satoshi from that.
