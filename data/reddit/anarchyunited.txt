There were many comments made about bitcoin and cryptos in general during that hearing.

Considering the statements made during the congressional hearing on Libra it is safe to say that this is the position of most the government.

Because a compromise is an in between between two sides. Just getting what you want without giving them anything is not a compromise.

Use the calculations for something useful like primecoin or maybe a proof of storage system that uses the storage for another purpose simultaneously.

Woah guys I'm no fan of politicians but this isn't good PR for Bitcoin.

No it's clearly not
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:36:21
A different method could provide the same value without the cost. Essentially yes for the current market right now there isn't waste, but there are steps we can take to make Bitcoin overall more valuable by reducing the costs.

Segregated witness is the shittiest way to make the lightning network possible we should switch to Flexible Transactions instead.

He has a point though Bitcoin companies are shit at marketing. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:34:35
I think Bitcoin needs to start considering other options than POW like proof of storage, burn, stake, or a hybrid of some of these.

Nope this is purely do to the fact that we have a 1MB cap on bitcoin.

Hard forking is not centralization. I have been around the ethereum Reddit and almost everyone seems to want a hard fork. Hard forking at this point is decentralized consensus.

So basically there is no technical advantage between a FT based LN or a segwit based LN.

How will people lose their funds in a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-01-24 15:38:07
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:30:13
Is there a technical reason that they prefer segwit, and if so please explain, or do they just support it for political reasons. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:03:45
Using the lightning network as an argument against BU and in favor of segwit makes no sense because if we go with BU Flexible Transaction will be implemented which will also allow the LN and FT will allow the lightning network without all of the technical baggage that comes with segwit.

Segwit is not a superior upgrade path it is a technical nightmare compared to FT.

The cause is obvious it’s the recovery that is interesting. It’s the recovery that defies modern economic thought.
Side Note: Do you always go on irrelevant tangents when asked a question? Do you think it makes you look smart? Do you realize it really only serves to avoid the point?

@_date: 2019-10-29 01:50:23
Do you not even understand what your tangent was? It wasn’t explaining the cause of the recession it was going on about Germany and Hitler. 
As for the 1920 recession the question posed is simple. Why did we recover from 1920 so much faster than 1929 when in 1920 we cut spending and let interest rates normalize? (The opposite of Keynesian theory) It’s important to note that the recessions were of similar severity.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:30:56
You make the claim that money printing is not responsible for our economic problems. It is and the video I linked shows why that is the case. If you can’t watch the whole thing start at 29:20.

Well it cancels out the security that they are holding which is also on the balance sheet.

Can you at least attempt an argument?
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:04:46
Please enlighten me
@_date: 2019-10-29 03:37:08
I can’t believe this needs to be explained to you. Let’s trace the relevance! You made a condescending comment about some guys opinion on monetary theory supposedly because it’s not his field. Someone replied to your comment and you reaffirmed your point. I played along with your appeal to authority and gave you a link to a video(which you have still not watched) from somebody who is an expert in the relevant field to see if that would satisfy you. (The point of this was to show that your problem with the opinion wasn’t actually who it was coming from) The reason this video is specifically relevant is because the 1920 recession poses challenging questions for your side of the monetary debate. You then replied to the topic of the video and in the first paragraph talked about the causes of the 1920 recession which doesn’t address the videos concerns but at least does add context to the topic. Then in the second paragraph you decided to share some speculation about how debt repayments caused hitler which is completely irrelevant to monetary theory. Do you understand now? 
Now onto your answer. Well England didn’t recover with America and France, but let’s pretend they did for the sake of your argument. Are you saying that the direction of monetary policy doesn’t matter as long as it’s coordinated? If stimulus is what gets economies out of recession how did they manage to get out of recession doing the exact opposite? Why would it matter if they coordinate on the supposedly wrong policy? 
Debt overhang really? How could you possibly determine if a company is actually in a debt overhang. If they actually did have a profitable venture why would investors not give them money? Why would banks not lend to them wouldn’t that just make the current lenders worse off if they didn’t find these supposedly profitable ventures. The reality is that many companies that supposedly suffer from debt overhang are just products of fed fueled speculation that never had a chance at profit in the first place and were only able to survive because of easy money monetary policies that allowed their creation. The banks and investors are wise not to continue giving these institutions money in a recession. But instead of starving these unproductive companies from capital Keynesians feed them in the name of keeping unemployment low. 
If you actually want to understand the recovery watch the video. If you are short on time skip to 29:20 and watch from there.

I’m pretty sure the repo agreement is counted as an asset on the balance sheet. So no, this is very relevant.

Well no it actually wasn't the most efficient way. If you study economics you would understand that forcing the slaves to spend their time doing that represents an opportunity cost to society.
