1. Write the latest Raspbian image to an SD card and boot it.  
2. Write the latest \[ whatever OS you want to use \] to a USB drive and plug it into the Pi.  
3. Run blkid to determine the PARTUUID of the USB drive.  
4. Edit /boot/cmdline.txt and change root=PARTUUID=xxxxxxxx to match the PARTUUID of the USB drive.  
5. Reboot. The Pi should be running from the USB drive.  
If you ever need to boot from a different USB drive or from the SD card, it's necessary to FIRST mount the boot partition of the SD card (/dev/mmcblk0p1) and edit the boot partition's cmdline.txt so that root=PARTUUID=xxxxxxxx matches the device you wish to boot from.  
PS. found this here [ .... I think this is how i did it.

AFAIK you need a BTC node to run a lightning node. At the moment only a full node because it just finished syncing so I havent set up the LN node yet.
