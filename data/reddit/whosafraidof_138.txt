Literally the reason why I bought bitcoins. Didn't care much about cryptocurrency at the time, but seeing the crash, I knew I had to buy in. Follow the same principle for stock trading on big cap stocks - hasn't failed me yet.

Any downsides and/or upsides to using this? How fast is verification and ACH? Is this the right URL?

Those are my stock investments, not crypto investments. His argument was that stock investments go up 2% a year, while I'm saying he's an idiot. I'm also saying that diversification is important in any "investing". And that everyone's risk tolerance is different.

When I deposited on the 22nd of December, it took them 10 days to get the funds in. So yeah.. Keep waiting.

My portfolio is up 25% from two years in the game. What 2% are you talking about? 
I'm also invested in BTC and altcoins as well. Why the need to shit on other investments? 
We're all just trying to increase the value of our money. Some people are risk averse, some people diversify more. There is 0 need to shit on other types of investments thinking you are holier than thou. Makes you look close minded.

The point isn't whether it's possible to get 25%, or whether it's high, or low, or whatever. It's his idiotic statement of it being 2%.

The PHP code stored in the DB tells itself to write to itself. It's like fractal/recursive programming. You don't know about this? Pleb. /s
