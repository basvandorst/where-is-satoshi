Isn’t ’segwit’ (addresses starting with 3) a newer protocol than ’native segwit’ (bc1 addresses)? Why do people say you should create a native segwit wallet then? Which is newer/cheaper/more efficient?
Which is better to choose?

the daily discussion thread in this sub is always dead
nobody discusses shit
go discuss stuff you people
wtf are you doing
need stuff to read, bored af

But that was before Bitcoin was brought into the mainstream.
You can’t compare two time periods which are completely different on a macro level.
Anyway, I hope as much as you that I am wrong about all this. Like I said, I’m holding in my Ledger for the next few years regardless.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:59:53
but technology moves so fast
who is to say crypto as a whole won't get replaced by something even more novel and brilliant within in the next couple years
it's hard to keep up with the pace of technological innovation
think about the phone you used 10 years ago and compare it to the iPhone 11 pro
I know this seems unrelated to crypto, but it is a possibility that some new concept comes out for payments/store of value/or whatever which renders crypto and BTC completely worthless
I hope I'm wrong. I just bought a ledger a month ago and planned to hold all my BTC for a long time

Is BTC and crypto as a whole running out of steam?
Seems like nobody gives a fuck about this stuff anymore and we've been in a downtrend ever since the pump earlier this year. I hope 2020 is better.

I’m no TA expert, but doesn’t the 1 year chart just look like a steady descent to 0 ever since the 2019 12k pump. Just small bumps along the way (like last month) but a clear and strong downtrend.
Scared for my BTC going into 2020 tbh. Who knows where it will stop.
And I just bought a ledger last month and stowed away all my  BTC safely to hold for a few years ��
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:37:50


Exactly. I agree completely.
@_date: 2019-11-01 21:21:07
So which is the best to choose for my wallet? Native segwit(bc1) or segwit?
@_date: 2019-11-15 04:21:21
what the fuck
@_date: 2019-11-01 22:40:22
Thanks! But why is it called ‘native’ if bc1 is newer?
@_date: 2019-11-02 08:11:49
I really think the

then it's game over
the credits play and all our wallets get liquidated

What’s the most active BTC subreddit? Serious question.
This place is dead as fuck. Nobody discusses shit here.

I just tried logging into Binance after a long time and it worked even though I'm in the US. How come it let me?  I thought they disabled it for all US customers?
I mean, it didn't even give me a message saying your account is closed or anything. In fact it still shows my small 2 dollar balance.
Anyone know how this is possible?

Is it safe to order a ledger nano s from Amazon if it says that the seller is Ledger?
Like 100% safe?

Why hold BTC over ETH?
Looking for reasons why BTC is a better long term hold than ETH.
@_date: 2019-10-27 04:44:09
why is this thread dead today
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:48:41
Things changed so quickly in under 12 hours lol
I remember falling asleep last night sad af that BTC didn't rebound and I was sure we were heading to $6k
OUT OF NO WHERE $10K WTF

The requirement used to be there for older firmwares. Now it's not required anymore.
This will clear up the confusion:
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:06:15
That's not how markets work. You can't just choose a price to buy at unless it's less than the market price, in which case it's a limit order.

Why do you need your recovery phrase when you do a firmware upgrade for your ledger nano s? Shouldn't your pin be enough?
I thought you only need the recovery phrase if you lose or destroy the device and want access to the funds on a new device?
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:15:58
BTC, the KING
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:56:12
yes, but that's not the reason why it is required.
I want to know why exactly the phrase is required.

No offense to bitcoin, but I and many of my peers unironically love fiat and the sense of security it provides ��
Banks make me feel like my money is safe and insured in case I ever get hacked ��
I think the price of BTC is going down because people are all realizing this. Banks and fiat will never die due to their stable nature. Also, the boomers ���� won’t ever let it die ��
BTC ��
