Oki. Maybe I will test cex.io in the near future with not too much money :D
I agree that reports there are not conclusive and mostly revolve around hard procedure to get confirmed. Hopefully this site is legit and I won't have problems with withdrawals.

According to this pic, the theft happened on 2 or 3 occasions before the final theft.

Up to you.
After I read comments on site  I changed my mind about depositing bitcoins there. 25$ higher price for bitcoin is not worth risking problems.

He was not asking for documents. He was asking for evidence. That kroter guy is just stupid as ****. IQ 80 or lower.

Where is your proof for such accusations?
I have received ETC to my bitfinex account when withdrawing ETH from BTC-e. Unfortunately I realized that after btc-e wallet was already emptied (bitfinex added ETC when btc-e wallet was already empty for days. But they still added etc coins to my account).
Kraken exchange complained that if they followed ETH foundation recommendations, they would lose their ETC as well. Btc-e lost them following eth fundation recommendation. Eth developers are to blame for creating unnecessary fork without providing protection from replay "attacks".

I assume they didn't have as many ETHs in their hot wallet as btc-e had. Also coinbase has withdrawal limits while btc-e has virtually no withdrawal limit (one could create another account to be able to withdraw additional 10k eths, which was daily limit).
As a confirmed user I can only withdraw 3000$ worth of coins daily on coinbase. On the other hand I would be able to withdraw ~120k$ worth of ETH's a day without even creating another account on btc-e.
Basically - better cold wallet practice and withdrawal limits in place can save exchanges from huge losses.

Yes, I got 2 withdrawals out, another 2 are now waiting to be processed. But I am waiting already 2 hours for them to be processed.

It is better than nothing. I still have half of bitcoins on bitfinex. Hoping to get them out asap. :)

Bitfinex still holds 2 of the 3 keys and 2 keys are enough to create transaction. But I would still like to lock my 11 bitcoins I sent after the hack and before they made the hack public.

Yes. And this is very bad because both companies proved that they are incompetent. Bitfinex would need competent staff, not kindergarten.
They don't even disclose with which law enforcement offices they are working. Maybe there is no such office.

Cool. Btc-e lost around 500k ETC. Thats why those dumps happened at 0.0008 and 0.0007btc/etc prices. (500k is my assumption and not some official figure - their wallet has/had around 500k ETH/ETC's)

They brought that blog page back, but updated that the information on is no longer valid, because insurance ended in Jan 2016.

A lot of bad reviews for site cex.io. People complain about having their funds stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:32:53
BFX still owes me 36% that they took from me. Nowhere did I agree with conversion of my bitcoins and USD to BFX coins. BFX are just joke coins.

He wasn't actually bitching about the coin. He was bitching about response of Vitalik and the dev team. And he was 100% right. Because of incompetent ETH developer team, btc-e and other exchanges lost many etc coins. Fork happened to bail out a few DAO owners. DAO was a scheme to make ETH price rise even faster. There should be no bailout. DAO should never exist, it was terrible idea. 
But whatever. At least we have ETC now, which is better coin than overpriced ETH. 
On the other hand, Bitfinex should do what they were telling us they are doing - keep 99.5% of coins out of hot wallets. My loses on Bitfinex are big but I have to agree with his sentiment. Hard fork and eth dev response was terrible. They knew about replay attack but didn't want to fix it, neither did they give proper instructions to exchanges.

How will that help me get my money out?
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:44:42
There should be no haircut. They should just limit withdrawals to % of intended haircut and then pay the rest over time through fees they generate.
They should also use cold wallet and not being idiots they are having 100% of their coin balance in hot wallet.
They should let all future deposits to be withdrawn with no limits, but current deposits should be limited. This or something close to this proposal is the only way Bitfinex will be able to continue.

Yes, something must be wrong with their calculation. Maybe they didn't include 39coweGgC8CPZ6hYL1BBEfc1zqbSfHsprW in their calculations. Bitfinex has to explain themselves or redo calculations. They should also cover some of the losses from their profits in the past.

Nope, our money is still locked there.
