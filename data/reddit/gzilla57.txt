Or we could just make it so wallets don't rely on shitty UX.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:31
This is a current problem with cryptos. 
I'm not worried about Robinhood locking me out. 
If we could address this, would be better for everybody. 
Of course it is risky, it shouldn't be. Or no where near as much as it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:52:22
I don't get how $1500 seems reasonable but $15000 doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:48:16
Yeah that's why I said "if nothing else" because I knew I was probably leaving something out. Thanks for filling in the gaps. 
Good point, but can you explain further. 
How could arbitrage work if the futures are all fiat backed? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:12
Joe said today he will be on again soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:21:26
You didn't read it all. He said he sold. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:34:44
He's actually not. You're just a pompous ass hat. 
Congratulations. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:16:23


Yeah the quantity (USD) is constant. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:06:45
Driving on public roads and writing with your public education their bub? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:23
FYI will be on again soon according to Rogan. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:27:43
No worries! No need to apologize, just trying to explain in detail. 
It looks like iOS is the only platform it isn't on. TIL.  Hopefully you have a computer you could use? 
Or someone will suggest an iPhone alternative I'm sure. Must be asked pretty often on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:41:57


Well I'll stop you there, I can't prove it because I can't afford a lawyer cuz they took my shit  


As determined by them


Pretty sure you only have to declare it when you realize gains. 


@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:57
Explain? 
Unless they create their own and convince others to use it also?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:01:48
Of course it's not an investment plan. It could be a $30 Lego kit (if it was something you wanted) and it's still an  amazing thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:12:10
Electrum is the app
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:39:23


Because I do not know how to prove that in a court of law. Of course not literally all property. But perhaps most of the disposable bit. 


True, but who wins in a he-said-she-said with a cop?


Right, so currently if I bought btc in 2014 and never sold it, I can hide it all I want until I convert to USD. This law would make that illegal. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:28:47
Not necessarily.
Futures can be used to hedge against the risk of actually owning btc leading to more investment
People in btc as speculator's might pull out to put money in futures instead leading to prices going down
People who own a lot of BTC could open short positions and sell off
Futures could make insitutuonal investors see more potential/legitimacy in btc and lead to a spike. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:46:48
It is free.
It is not a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is a physical device like a USB drive. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:11:21
Possibly. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:24:35
Not sure what you're asking. 
Blockchain is a technology and how Bitcoin works. 
Electrum is an app, which helps you create a personal wallet for storing Bitcoin. There are other ways to create a wallet, electrum is just a commonly recommended and easy to use method. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:52:52
Wait come back I edited and added a question lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:49:42
On this blessed day 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:23:40




Yes and No. They will flow into the future market, but in theory this will also legitimize the BTC market also leading to an influx. Futures can also be used to hedge risk in the actual market. 


Yes you are wrong, if nothing else the futures markets will have a pyschological effect on Crypto holders, and can also lead people to pull out of BTC into the futures markets instead. 
Certainly no one can predict what happens in reality. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:03:25
Lol gotcha. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:25:21
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:51:45
They are named after companies though...
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:47:14
He will spend and donate it anywhere that takes crypto. 
Well not all of it. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:28:10
It was a joke about how they will also dissapear in a way that seems crazy at some point. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:35:17
What's an iPad?
Edit: "Did you mean iPad?" Or something. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:39:49
Saying "I want world peace" has that effect to some degree. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 00:04:31
That's the point. The protocol has uses outside of strictly finance. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 01:50:26
Yup I'm sure that's still the case. He was even matching the donations but I'm not sure if that still applies. 
He also either just had or is about to have the guy from that charity on the podcast. He mentioned it on the recent andreas podcast
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:21:07


Part I hadn't thought of. Obviously. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:59:51
That's not how economics works. Of course it would be better if everyone else just tipped everyone all the time. But just saying that won't make it happen. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:49:37
Right but now whoever stole them has way more than before. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 20:07:14
Aww, you think you're better than him because you reject objective value. Cute. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:01:07
"Whirled...not twisted."
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:27:53
He didn't ask them "please give me the option to pay with bitcoin" he asked if they had that option available because the circumstances led him to believe that might be the case. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:24:55
Its current utility and value or it's potential utility and value?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:50:33
Don't worry they aren't allowed on Reddit. Wait no. 


@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:46
These will exist for btc. 
[EDIT - FINE](
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:51:10
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:05:56
The difference is that nothing about what makes block chain an innovation on par with the internet is specific to Bitcoin or gives any reason for Bitcoin to succeed vs a coin that doesn't exist yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:28:44
[Ok I fixed it now](
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:14:12
Or just people that take their money out of coin and into betting on the coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:13:29
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:12:35
That's not what futures means 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:58:50
Was just joking around. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:20:41
That is true. 
Neither you or anyone else will be doing that this month, and if you are you won't be taking my money to invest. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:22:29
