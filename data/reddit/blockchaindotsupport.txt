Try 1 million.

I'm curious to learn about his methods. Is it straight up bruteforcing or what?

You absolutely cannot trust **any** leaders in the space.
Fixed it for ya ��

Of course not I write programmable money code.   What Proof of Work or as it's called in academic circles, Nakamoto consensus, did by defining something digital in terms of something physical is immeasurable. I'm 99% sure Hal was 1/xth of Satoshi.
RIP Hal you beautiful bastard.

You still require KYC though right?

My body is ready for 1 Satoshi = 1 USD.

My theory is that there would be a point where 50 to 100 Satoshi will get you a gram of gold and that's about the same it would cost in terms of fiat USD. It'll be a result of both BTC deflating and USD inflating.

Use bisq or hodlhodl my dude

I'd like to live in a world where things are priced in sats. That's unlikely anytime soon so I'll take 1 sat = ~1 USD.
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:26:39
lol that's great. I don't see how this is progress though.

I'm sorry for your loss but not your keys not your coins is the way my dude.
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:43:36
My man, keeping their BTC cold. 
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:39:49
Can confirm. Also with all that PMC bank bullshit going on and govt banning all crypto, I'm pretty sure it'll just accelerate the whole thing.

I prefer Satoshi.

I'll say it: Fuck Taxes. Only the middle class/working class people pay taxes because TDS. The rich find ways using their money, power and influence to pay the lowest amount possible. The poor can't pay taxes. I don't give a fuck about taxes until governments start acting like a DAO and are actually accountable for the public money they lose.
Satoshi wouldn't have agreed. The point is not to convert BTC to fiat INR/USD, the point is to put the power of value creation into an algorithm insted of some crooked banks.

It was about time I started distributing propaganda posters.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:05:26
I understand the brute forcing nature of it, but if Satoshi had the key, would he/they be able to spend these bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:16:12
How is it proven that the coins are unrecoverable? Couldn't there theoretically be a private key associated with that address?
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:17:11
But does Satoshi own the private key?
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:13:13
Still begs the question, why would someone send satoshis to Genesis address? Why now?
