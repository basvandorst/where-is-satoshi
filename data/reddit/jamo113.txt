i want to buy a BMW with my BTC !!!
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:10:22
scan the public key with Blockchain.info mobile app as a watch address. attempt to send BTC from the watch address
you will be prompted to scan the private key to send the BTC.

i bought in at $50 as $100 seemed like the price it was heading for

ok, so what is the correct method to spend from a paper wallet ?
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:02:23
localbitcoins is an escrow service so they will probably need to approve the transfer manually before it enters the blockchain

nice work man, im going to follow suite with a clothing line
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:05:05
yes there was, i was around from $40 right through to $120 there was heaps of hype and it was gaining $10-15 per day over the week
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:50:39
well thats a valid concern but it has not been a problem surprisingly
what astounds me is that bitaddress and likes do not regenerate duplicate  keys (that are already in use) its bound to happen one day 
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:52:29
buy more BTC :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:41:50
talk to a mod... there is a post like yours every single day but nothing is done about it.. have fun policing it

very good but what guarantee is there that you are not caching  each print job ? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:43:13
i guess the miners need to cover their costs so they will be offloading the coins for either fiat or other services
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:21:24
you may have some luck with brute force by loading the e-book into the brute force dictionary, i would seek professional help though, its worth a $1500 recovery fee for sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:38:02
price goes up up up until someone wants to exchange for gov backed fiat or goods and services

Buy shit
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:58:50
don't buy into litecoin at double digits!! only buy in at the single digits.... 
im calling $100 absolute cealing for litecoin.. there is no infrastructure for it 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:06:12

the old change address issue.. this is an issue especially for the mums and dads...
Id like to know if i have 20 BTC in a paper wallet address, and i send 1 BTC somewhere from the paper wallet spend QR, which address will the change go to?  
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:08:27
i have 2 friends with $40k plus sitting on Gox that they cannot get out...
maybe this is a move to get more retailers on board and keep the speculators away ?
Id rather just trade back for BTC and withdraw BTC then go buy a BMW with said BTC
