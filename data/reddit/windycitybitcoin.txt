I would assume some type of commercial enterprise. 
E.g. Providing services or goods to consumers = a business.
Acquiring bitcoins for purposes of spending them on goods and services and/or investments != not a business. 
Admittedly, this is only conjecture though. It is an unknown landscape we are walking.

Well, the primary thing is that this is not an ATM. It is not attached to a user's deposit account. It is a kiosk that operates more like a vending machine except that you can sell the merchandise as well as buy it. 
FinCEN has ruled that bitcoin is NOT a currency, therefore the regulations are going to be a little different. 
But, to be honest this is a novel situation and I cannot give firm answers at this point. We'll find out eventually what the State is going to do!

Hi! We're actually currently discussing this with regulatory officials. One of our goals is to engage in an open dialogue to make sure that all licensing is effective. 
The Company Line is that this is not an ATM and should therefore not be required to submit to those stringent licensing requirements. I do plan on keeping up to date with our state regulatory and licensing requirements. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:07:47
Correct. We will only be licensed in IL for this kiosk (and hopefully more!). 
The ultimate goal is to be successful with this kiosk and then move to other locations in IL before moving to other states. We'll see what happens!

Switch to Chase. When I set up our business account the banker knew what bitcoin was and when they had to call someone to figure out what industry to put my business in (we're operating Robocoin kiosks) the person on the phone knew what bitcoin was and didn't blink an eye.
Was set up with no problems in about an hour. 
Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:14:01
Of course. We are planning on being very proactive with all regulations. Will involve an increase in the operational costs, but I would rather be compliant.

Right now I'm waiting on some final investment so I am okay right now. Shoot me an email at chicagobitcoin and I'll keep you in the loop if it looks like we need another round of financing. 
I am actually looking for a graphic designer to help me with a logo. I was thinking of a .2 bounty for it. Let me know if you're interested. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:00:47
Both. We will register with FinCEN as a MSB as well as some unknown State licensing. There will likely be County and Municipal licensing required as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:49:27
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:13:22
Thanks! I'm hopeful as well!
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:10:59
Goal is March 2014. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:05:46
That is definitely my  spot after the Loop right now. I feel that the culture there would be a better fit for Bitcoin right now, although I like the accessibility of the Loop for people from the outlying suburbs. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:32:30
Thanks. Our fingers are crossed that it will be a smooth process.
No, there are not. I know someone is trying to get one started in Boston, but I have not heard about any others. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:32:06
Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:11:56
Well, we'll see here shortly if that is the case although I doubt it. It is likely that there will be a bond requirement, although I do not see that as being prohibitive. The transactions are limited to $3k per person each day which satisfies KYC and FinCEN regulations. 
What I think is a key factor is that we do not hold customer money. We will provide bitcoin for cash in an instaneous transaction. Typically, in the money transmitter space, you are required to have a hefty bond secondary to holding of customer money for "x" amount of time. Windy City Bitcoin will purchase bitcoin with our own capital and then sell it to our users. The transaction is instant with no holding of consumer funds.

Agreed.  I worry as that location is very small.  It might integer with their coffee business.... 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:57:29
No. None are up in the US yet. :) There is substantial risk but we are not without options. If the regulatory environment becomes too difficult or prohibitive we can sell the kiosk on the secondary market or install it in a friendlier city. 
Fortune favors the bold. :) That being said we're fairly confident we have the ability and tools to see this to fruition. 
I do appreciate your concerns though and kind words. We do have a twitter available, albeit it is not active. twitter.com/windycitybtc.

No. See the FinCEN guidance here: 
In sum, users who send and use bitcoins do not need to be registered, however, exchanges do. A user is defined as: 
A person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services. 
An exchange is:
A person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. 
So, under this definition, he is definitely a Money Services Business. Whereas this sounds terrible, he can easily register as an MSB and then comply with the requirements, that although arduous, are more time consuming. Hey may want to limit his transaction size to under $10k, but it is doable. 
To your question regarding whether or not sending a bitcoin to or from another user requires an MSB registration, I would posit that it doesn't secondary to the verbiage, "An exchanger is a person *engaged as a business* . . . . If you're not engaged as a business you should be alright.

That would be awesome. It would be great to start a Chicago Bitcoin community here. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:02:36
Not at the moment, however feel free to email me at chicagobitcoin and I'll keep your information on file should we decide to do another round of financing. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:22:55
Awesome idea! I'll look into this. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:31:17
Exactly. I like the word "kiosk". It is our company policy not to use the term "ATM" for those specific reasons. :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:26:32
I am looking into this as well as I live in the Loop and I do like that location. The difficulty is placement of the kiosk. I want it easily accessible for everyone, ideally with a place to hang out and talk about bitcoin. 
Luckily I have some contacts there and will be looking into it. :) 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:49:51
Beat me to the punch Thanks for the post. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:18:49
Hi Cab000se! 
A response to your points:
1. Based upon the success of the other kiosk I think we'll be okay with this. Further, the reasoning for such measures is to ensure that we comply with KYC regulations and limits set by FinCEN as a money services business. I also think people will enjoy the technology as it will keep their transaction safe and legal.
2. We're working on this and so far, so good. There is a capital and time requirement for any business, this is just the same thing. 
3. Robocoin has actually reduced their fee per transaction to only 33% of each transaction fee. It is not for maintenance, but instead for the licensure of their proprietary software that effectuates the bitcoin/cash transaction. As far as your infographic, I was able to negotiate with Robocoin and resolve any and all questions I had with the contract. They were a pleasure to work with and had no problem changing the contract to terms we were comfortable with. 
4. There is always the risk for this, however, I feel it is unlikely. Hopefully by being one of the first to provide this type of service we can liaison with the government and teach them about bitcoin in a way to forestall prohibitory regulation. 
Thanks for your kind words! If you have any other questions I'd love to respond to them.

Thanks! Regulatory and licensing. This is a completely novel venture and the State is not sure how it should be licensed. We're currently in discussions with the Dept. of Finance and their legal department to determine how the business should be classified. 
And that is just at the State level. Compliance with FinCEN regulations are going to be a big part of what we do. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:37:05
I have not heard anything. I just processed a coinbase transaction with this account so we'll see what happens. I was open and obvious about my bitcoin business. 
Thank you for the warning though!
