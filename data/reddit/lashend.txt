Thanks a lot for this how-to. I did exactly as you suggested – slowly, slowly - 
1.	I went to bitaddress.org, “Single Address” tab, generated a few trial Bitcoin addresses. For each one: 
2.	I recorded the Bitcoin Address and the Private Key. 
3.	I went over to the Wallet Details tab. 
4.	I entered the Private Key from Step 2. 
5.	It generated an associated Bitcoin Address; Bitcoin Address Compressed; 2 different Public Keys; and 4 different Private Keys.  It says the key formats are WIF, WIFC, HEX, B64, B6, MINI, BIP38
6.	(I tried to download Mycellium so I could do exactly as you’re doing, but I see that there’s no desktop version.)
7.	So instead I went to Electrum. (I tried to download Mycelium, but there’s no desktop app.) I think I find the task to import a private key that you’re talking about. I did a little internetting, and I think this is called a Sweep in Electrum: 


In Electrum 2.0, you cannot import private keys in a wallet that has a seed. You should sweep them instead.
Sweeping private keys means to send all the bitcoins they control to an existing address in your wallet. The private keys you sweep do not become a part of your wallet. Instead, all the bitcoins they control are sent to an address that has been deterministically generated from your wallet seed.
To sweep private keys go to Wallet menu -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Sweep. Enter the private keys in the appropriate field. Leave the ‘Address’ field unchanged. That is the destination address and it’ll be from your existing electrum wallet.
(These are steps 8,9,10 ... I don't know to make it look right ...) 
8.	So in Electrum I went to Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Sweep &gt; And I entered the private key from the trial bitcoin address I generated in Step 2. It seems to accept the address (it un-grays the Sweep button, which is the Enter or Next button). 
9.	It seems to “run,” and then it gives a pop-up message: ““No inputs found. Note that inputs need to be confirmed.” I think this is saying that there are no bitcoins associated with that wallet (?), which makes sense, since this is the trial one I just created. 
10.	Now I think it’s going to be the moment of truth, and I repeat the process. When I enter what I think is my private key (the 36/32-character string beginning with 5), it does not un-gray/un-lock the “Sweep” (next, proceed) button, and I can’t proceed. 
Damn. This makes me think that the 36/32-character MyWallet string that I have is not in fact the private key … 
Am I at a dead end? Any last-ditch efforts at this point, or do I give up? 
THANK YOU!

Just want to say thank you again for your help in getting this far. I think I might have made some progress, and I'll come back as soon as I hear from Coinbase. I wrote a summary of what I've tried and where I am now:  
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:52:01
Ok! I’ve gotten into Blockchain.info and accessed my account. (I think.)  But I don’t see any funds in it. And I know I “left” some funds there back in 2012. From Blockchain’s dashboard,  I searched “All Bitcoin Wallets” for “All Transactions,” and it produced no results... Maybe this also suggests it wasn't what I used in 2012, since (I think?) I would have had to undertake at least two transactions - one to buy the bitcoins in the first place, and the second to issue the bitcoins to the author when I bought the book. (Right?)
Does this mean that whatever funds I had in there are no more and have disappeared?  Or does it mean that I was using some wallet other than Blockchain, and *that’s where the funds are? 
Thank you again very much for your helpfulness in walking me through these things. I really appreciate it. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:31:35
Wow, thank you to everyone here for your help in figuring this out. I think I’ve been able to make some progress. I’ll write an update here and then reply below, too. 
STATUS RIGHT NOW: Awaiting Verification from Coinbase.
Ok, I tried to put on my best detective hat and scoured my hard drives as best I could, following all the tips and clues everyone here gave me. Here’s the chronology I’ve been able to put together. (Note: The year was 2013, not 2012: Wrong header on “that” document – as I got into the detailed notes, I realized I was in 2013. The rest of my searches confirm the date range.) Here’s the chronology I found: 
I find the first references in my email and in my computer/storage-stored electronic files to **Ebookoid.net**. Using Ebookoid as a search seed, I find some files that that have some data associating them with ebookoid. I think these are the books I was able to download for free. The one I wanted required me to pay in bitcoin. So … 
I enrolled in **Coinbase** to be able to purchase the bitcoins. Aha! **This might be something**.  My first email search hit for “bitcoin” comes from Coinbase.com. 


Good news. You can now buy and sell more bitcoin on Coinbase.
We've raised your limits to the following:
Buy Limit:  	10.00 BTC per day
Sell Limit:  	50.00 BTC per day
You can view these limits at any time from the verifications page.
You can visit the buy page now to start a new purchase.
Thank you for choosing Coinbase!
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
I wrote an email to someone that I’m “waiting for confirmation” from Bitcoin. (Or is it coinbase?). Maybe you’ll enjoy my commentary of the moment:  


I find this in my notes: 


The Albala book gets created in the files of my computer. If I do a half-smart search on my Mac, I can find the PDF version I want with the Ebookoid reference; when I open up its basic More Info panel, I see this in the category “Where From”: (deleted)XXX
So: It begins to look like on 8/23/13, I received the confirmation I’d been waiting for of my “bitcoin” account, made my initial money input, and made my first purchase (to or via ebookoid.net) using bitcoins. But it turns out that when I’m talking about my “bitcoin account,” I’m really talking about my “Coinbase account,” where (it seems) I bought and stored the bitcoins. 
So, - Yes! - Searching for “coinbase” in my email, I find an email saying: 


On DATE, 2013 you purchased XXX BTC via bank transfer.
Those bitcoins are now available in your Coinbase account!
Thank you for the purchase.
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
And then I get another email saying: 


You can view this transaction at any time from your account.
Kind regards,
The Coinbase Team
So, doing a little math and checking out an online “what would it be worth” calculator, that would be … wow! So, uh, yeah, let’s keep going! Thanks for keeping me at it this long, everyone – I might have thrown in the towel otherwise. And, yeah, I’m going to owe something more than a thank you to all of you if we can get this figured out!! 
*8/25/13  ~ For your amusement only ~ I find this note: “FIND OUT: What is Google Hangout? Like Skype?”*
 
**NOW, TODAY – and CURRENT STATUS: AWAITING COINBASE VERIFICATION:**
I have gone to the Coinbase site and tried to log in. I see that my confirmation phone number is a long-dead overseas phone number that I had in action in – yep – August 2013. I updated my phone number, went through an ID-uploading verification process, and am now waiting for “up to 72 hours” for verification. I think I understand that Coinbase is a hybrid exchange/wallet. In my case, that makes sense: it looks like that’s where I bought it, and (I guess) that where I “deposited”/stored it. 
SO: I will come back with an update as soon as I hear back from Coinbase and get into my account and see if what I’m looking for is there. (Until then, I’ll be waiting with fingers crossed!)
**THANK YOU TO EVERYONE VERY MUCH, and I’ll be back as soon as I hear something.**

@_date: 2018-02-15 19:24:10
Thank you! I’ve tried doing this: I downloaded Electrum. I imported a wallet with “private keys or addresses”. I “accepts” when I enter the 32-character string (which I think is “my bitcoin address” and has 0 BTC); but it does not accept (won’t “open” the Next button) when I enter the 36-digit MyWallet ID (which is where I think the bitcoins should be). 
Can you identify what I’m doing wrong? Thank you very much for your help, again. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:29:31
Thanks. I went to bitref.com just like you said. 
When I enter the 34-char public key (the one beginning with 1), it accepts the entry and allows me to "Check." And - damn - it shows no transaction history. 
The only thing I can think of at this point is that I didn’t know what I was doing, created two different wallets (two different public keys/addresses) … and recorded the address (public key) for one of them (the one without the coins) … and the private key for the other (the one with the coins). ??
Am I at a dead end? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:20:44
I think I have the private key (the 36-char string), but I don't see how to enter it in Electrum. These are the steps I'm doing: 
File &gt; New/Restore
I think I want to make a new wallet, so I name it Wallet_1 and click Next.
What kind of wallet do you want to create? [It gives me four choices: 1. Standard Wallet. 2. Wallet with two-factor authentication. 3. Multi-signature wallet. 4. Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys.] 
I think I want to “Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys,” so that is what I choose. And I click Next. 
It tells me: “Enter a list of Bitcoin addresses 	(this will create a watching-only wallet), or a list of private keys. 
I enter what I think is the private key (the 36-char string, “MyWallet ID”). I want to click “Next” to proceed, but the Next button remains grayed out. 
So I think: Ok, maybe I enter the key later, and I enter the bitcoin address here. So I try the 32-digit string (this is “My Bitcoin Address”). Now it’s possible to click Next, and I do. 
It creates the wallet (or imports it?) and gives this pop up message: 
“This wallet is watching-only. This means you will not be able to spend Bitcoins with it. Make sure you own the seed phrase or the private keys, before you request Bitcoins to be sent to this wallet”
I say OK, and now I see an empty console. I’m looking at the “History” tab, and there is no data. 
I don’t see a way to enter the private key … 
Thank you very, very much… Very much, really! If I get this figured out, … 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:31:47
Thank you! And yes - I'm going to owe a lot people coins if I can manage to get this figured out! :) 
From some of the posts above it sounds to me that the 36-char string might be the private key. After seeing those, what do you think? 
Blockchain doesn't sound familliar, and I don't have anything in my historic notes about it. I went to the site and tried my login email and password, and it didn't work. When i submitted the "send me my password" button, it told me that it doesn't have my email on file. So I think I probably wasn't using blockchain. Shoot.
Thanks for the suggestion, in any case - it was worth a try!

@_date: 2018-02-15 16:20:14
Thanks for confirming that. Yes, it sounds like the string I have has the same formation: it's 36 characters with dashes, 32 without, numbers and lower-case letters. So this is the "MyWallet ID", right? Do I understand correctly (from a poster above) that I can "use" this ID if and only if I can track down the wallet.dat file that it's associated with? Or is there another way to "use" this ID to get at my account? Thank you again!
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:38:51
Thanks. I see. As you can tell – I’m over my head in experience, and I’m learning on the fly as I go along! 
I guess it’s safe to post the public key. (I wasn’t sure about that at first, but at this point I think I understand at least that much. 
I checked it in Bitref (suggested by another poster), and it shows no transaction history and no balance. 
Am I at a dead end, in your book? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:17:35
Thank you! I wrote the same thing above, and I'll redo it here - I'm grateful for your advice, thank you! 
I have a different computer now than I did in 2012. I do have an external hard driving housing what I could salvage from the 2012 computer’s hard drive when it died. I’ve done some searching there, too, for “wallet.dat,” and I don’t find it. Is there any way it might be on that drive and “difficult” to find? Or should a “wallet.dat” search be sufficient to locate it

Thank you! 
So, it sounds like the 36/32-character string is the “private key” of the wallet where, at least at some point in history, I had some bitcoins. I *think * I understand that that I must “apply” this private key in the presence of a wallet.dat file – in other words, the private key without the associated wallet.dat file is useless. (And, if I lost track of the wallet.dat, then it’s gone and done and that’s that? Do I understand that correctly? Is there any way I might recover the wallet.dat (which I guess I don’t have) with the private key (which I guess I do have)?

THanks for the cautionary tip! I'll be careful. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:55:17
Are you sure? I followed the link (thank you) and I read this : 
Nearly every 256-bit number is a valid ECDSA private key. Specifically, any 256-bit number from 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140 is a valid private key.

Thanks for your help!
It does start with a 5, and it does sound like it's a private key. 
I found the info in an old DOC file. I was finally getting around to purging some of my old research and writing files (as you can tell: it's not on computer science, that's for sure.). I came across a (Word) notes file from 2012 with a blurb I must have recorded as I was going through the process to buy the book I wanted to buy. (Evidently the author was only selling it via ebookoid.net, which only accepted bitcoins, so I looked into bitcoins, thought the idea was cool, and bought a few.) 
So, bottom line: it looks like I have a "single private key." Any way to "use" this to get at the coins? Or do I have to find that wallet.dat file first? If so, any suggestions for how I can find it? You sound like you know what you're talking about! Thank you again!
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:24:28
I found these on a post from 2014: 


This makes me think that at least we are thinking about “what I have at hand” in the right way: 
The 36-char string that begins with 5 is the private key. 
The 32-char string that begins with 1 is the public key. 
And, yes, if I check the Coins associated with it, I don’t see any. Whether or not I have the correct private key, I should at least be able to see how many coins are in it – Right? 
I think I’m at a dead end then? Damn. Do you agree? 
The only thing I can think of at this point is that I didn’t know what I was doing, created two different wallets (two different public keys/addresses) … and recorded the address (public key) for one of them (the one without the coins) … and the private key for the other (the one with the coins). ??
