It's ING
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:59:23
It is indeed but it supports USD euro and many other currencies so should be fine and 1% cashback in bitcoin is cool
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:44:57
I use all of them, including Wirex
@_date: 2019-03-26 23:42:42
It doesn't even have to do anything with crypto, I get such messages every month atleast few times and I can't use the banking services during that. I missed a payment deadline from my hosting provider bcos of this mess.

That's not the answer. Apart from being unable or helpless to stop bitcoin, I'm asking why would you allow the use of Bitcoin in a country run by you ?
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:21:07
Do you have any example in the history where govt gave away the control of something they truly own to its people  ?
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:05:54
Fair enough
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:05:14
Awesome find, thanks

It's actually pretty ok if you are not expecting OTF crypto to fiat conversion. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:25:10
I'm completely agree with you. What I'm trying to ask you is if it has ever happened before ?
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:31:12
I like that answer.
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:50:39
And doesn't support PLN so even pos transactions have 3% fee which makes it useless in here but if it supports your currency then it's pretty cool 
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:13:23
But how do you benefit as a Govt ? What is in for you when you can control the money.
@_date: 2019-03-27 09:27:16
I live in Poland dude, ING is as good as it gets 
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:17:14
I understand but as govt, why would you not fight it till the end. Why won't you make people's life hell who own bitcoins ?  I'm trying to understand why Govt will be fine one day if everyone uses Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:28:48
Why ?
@_date: 2019-12-29 11:30:05
I'm taking a train to Warsaw from Galleria Krakow today, almost thought of buying some more. I guess I'll visit Galleria Bronowice when Im back
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:15:00
Where in Krakow ?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:29:02
