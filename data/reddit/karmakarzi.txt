I guess she is really inspired by the Hugo Chavez school of economics.

It is true

Putin is seeing an opportunity to unseating USD as the main exchange currency, as long as his country does not have a severe enough capital flight problem.  The Chinese was thinking the same way too.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:36:52
Hmm the government will attempt to control that also.  The GFW is getting more and more sophisticated. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:34:55
Not until they outlaw mining also.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:33:20
A lot of people just withdraw and hold BTC and other cryptos.  So yes the Chinese still have much coin on their hands even after this drop.  My guess is ICOs won't fare as well.  Most of them will be gone.

Rich Chinese gobbling up stuff like hotels, movie chains and soccer teams out of government control.  A bad thing when China's foreign exchange reserve is shrinking.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:59:22
they need to bypass the Great Fire Wall which is becoming more sophisticated by the minutes.

Can't add more fiat to existing account.  But can still trade with funds already there.  That's why the volume is very low.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:53:31
just Chinese withdrawing BTC from exchanges.

Good points

Yes they have independent legal system as long as the Chinese central government decides not to interfere.  So it is a matter of severity of the problem.

The arbitrage has already been explored to a large degree.  Used to be a much larger difference.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:38:01
The difference is Zimbabwe does not have F-35s to back up its fiat. Still to hear this coming from someone associated with Bernie, who profess moral high grounds, is quite shocking.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:14:39
oh right.  Need some nap after all this craziness lol.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:34:06
Just remember the main purpose of the ban is to stop the outflow of capital, then think of the long term consequences.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:59:00
This is definitely different from the ICO ban a few days ago.  The Chinese authorities found the ICO ban not enough to stem the possible escape of capitals abroad, so this more severe measure has to be adopted.
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:01:37
Also want to add the current amount of capital flight through bitcoin is minimal compared to traditional means, but I guess they want to plug up the hole before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:23:53
ever hear something called the stampede effect?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:36:43
Many will attempt to bring the coins abroad.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:21:34
Not really.  Bitcoin mining will be state controlled.  Basically Bitcoin will become an export industry, just like toys.  The market will be subjected to the whim of the Chinese government.

Something tells me the correlation between people who frequent casinos and people who invest in crypto is pretty significant.
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:11:59
Yes China has threatened to close down exchanges before, but this time is real.  A few years back there was not such an urgency to stop capital flight.  So believe me this is not fake news.  Of course they won't kill the industry, they will simply semi-nationalize it.  After all it is another USD generating export industry.  Yeah they will attempt the unthinkable - controlling Bitcoin, or failing that, substitute it with its own crypto.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:22:34
Bitfinex has more or less normal volumes.  Does this mean most of the activities there now are from western traders?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:38:33

Chinese who arbitrage may not have credentials to do it on exchanges abroad.  Hence the premium on localbitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:24:37
It makes sense.  China is trying to utilize crypto to its own advantage (alt to USD) while minimizing its risks(money laundering and capital flight).  Whether it is going to be successful is wholly another matter.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:28:21
There are actually two pieces of sources in this article.  The first is quoted from a local official directly in charge of supervision of exchanges as saying "a total shutdown and exit from market in the near future".  The second piece is from NIFA as quoted in the Reuters article.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:10:55
You are on to something here.  Decentralization won't make or break bitcoin, adoption can.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:16:39
Long term wise I see technical issues more a problem for bitcoin growth.  The Chinese ban on exchanges will create a sizable short term dip though. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:15:49
Muahaha.  You don't know about Chinese government.  They don't care about their citizens because they will never rebel.  The only reason of the shutdown is to stop capital flight.
