Am i in court? LOL i actually heard it first on twitter,did some research and was amazed how awesome Bitcoin is,after seeing major company's already accepted it i was like "whoa why haven't i heard about it before" LOL i was actually pissed knowing Dell and Newegg is accepting it already LOL it could have been great paying my purchase with Bitcoin instead.
