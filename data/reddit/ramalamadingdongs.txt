I think OP mean mostly because Satoshi hold a lot of coin.  
  
If Roger Ver is arrested and coins get seized as property, there's no reason government would HOLD.  They'd liquidate it and that's what OP means by it.  
  
Isn't BTC the main entry between fiat and crypto?  
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:23:54
and all crypto has enjoyed the benefits of this because should this ever change, you'll have to compete security with actual military groups considering your currency a threat and willing to burn it all down to avoid you ever being trusted with running a competing ledger

My trip to Vegas was where I lost home BTC was more than a get rich quick scheme. ATMs there either limit you to $100 or don't work at all, and none process in less than an hour. My first wanted my license for $100 and took 3 hours because the support line wasnt answering. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:51:12
yea, it wasn't a 3 hour dot-matrix printout of the fiat.  after 3 hours of waiting for the transaction to get 6 confirmations, all five of those $20's came out in a single instant.

That might be the point of bitcoin but I'm not here to argue what's its ultimate goal was.  I'm here to debate how to get bitcoin to become a ledger that only the parties using it can control.  
  


   
It already takes a long time.  Doesn't BTC have a 33k transaction/day limit?  Doesn't matter if you trust 20% of miners, facebook proved we're all 5 degrees separated and if it takes two parties to perform a transaction we're now trusting 40% of the mining pool directly.  
  


  
A merchant would have multiple wallets but likely want to process it's own transactions.  Why would you buy something from a business and not trust their processors?   
  
People would likely build a list of processors by electing to adopt a business they frequent, friends, and the payroll from their employers.  
  
No different than giftcards IMO.  


   
You're convoluting this because visa isn't just another mastercard.  Both built similar but different systems.  It's the cardreaders that build support for which ever card they want and the merchant that chooses which they want to support, then which they want to accept.  And neither have their own currency they're a credit system.  
  
If you can separate the concept from the multitude of alternatives you're mushing into one, you should see that it's only slightly different than what we have now except it doesn't allow for wallets to outgrow competitors.  
  
Maybe this is exactly what will happen if it gets adopted but right now I think it's the hangup for why major corps don't adopt it

UGH,  I wrote like 4 sentences and you didn't even read the first one.  How would a merchant force you to use their miner if you aren't doing business with them?  
  
If you are doing business with them, how are you not doing what my first sentence read "use the miners both parties selected"?

Are you dense?  It was REGISTERED in 2008 in KN.  He's from there.  What are the chances?

Because what you own is the swift_number:account_number, that's the unique ID that they can't redistribute because it's associated with a spot on the ledger of what the bank owes you.  
  
I don't understand how you can claim that btc is a "value-preserving assets" when it increases in value because of limited quantity.  Gold gets cheaper as they mine more, if they stopped and said this is all the gold there is, it would increase in value despite not generating any.  
  
Copyrights aren't all "value-generating asset", I think you might be confusing a trademark?  A copyright could just be to protect something from being copied and devalued, which if crypto could have multiple copies of something supposedly unique it wouldn't be able to control a value.
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:09:22
You can own an account number at a bank, correct?  
  
Note they didn't say as "physical property" but it can be protected as intellectual property which copyright laws protect, which since bitcoin is copied from owner to owner and reassigned on the ledger, seems accurate.

anyone wonder how a near billionaire can recreate his platform, improve it, and not release his own crypto despite losing nearly a billion because it's centralized?

It was registered in KN, in 2008 by someone that knew about the paper before the world did.
What are the chances that a current KN citizen would own the domain publicly for an 'anonymous internet' ledger created in KN?

Remember JPMC was given 10 years immunity to short silver, because of Bear Stearns collapsing from doing it.  While shorting it JPMC went from holding 0oz to being the largest holder of physical silver in the world.

Confirmation that bitcoin.com was registered date (8/1/2008) was 3 months before publication (10/31/2008) in country of origin of by Roger Ver (KN).

There's almost zero crypto adopters that understand the need for internet to keep crypto's value.  I'd like for just one of them to show me a time they used this while camping or backpacking or just being off-grid for a while

There's two parties in a transaction.  You can add what ever elements you want to get what you want, but I clearly wrote the opposite of what you're inferring.   


  
Relevance?  You're just repeating what exists and clearly isn't perfect.  
  
I suggested a method to ensure miners don't consolidate.  My method would only let those miners with relationships to transacting parties earn into the system.  
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:12:30
Yea but has anyone here paid attention to Linux CoC drama?  
  
Adding 3rd parties to an open-source development is the step toward commercialization.  
  
Now that CoC is calling the shots, it's free to raise money and market or advertise itself.  "hey we've got an organization here, we need money to run, people need to be paid for their time" all the while it's only value is they control the developers DONATING their time.  
  
Congrats nix-devs, you've just enslaved the open-source project to corporations via CoC proxy.  All because the people that weren't donating ANYTHING positive to the project told you you weren't donating 'politically correctly'.  
  
Once CoC gets it's money it'll come for cryptos.

Until crypto offers a way to only let those trading hold coins and mine, mining will always consolidate and centralize.  The only way I see getting this to change is to let those performing the transaction choose the miner that processes the transaction.  
  
Ie: User 14 wants to buy from User 19, both show Users 4, 8, and 10 are common trusted processors and select those X to confirm the transaction and delegate to their designated processors to confirm their confirmations to the X-1.
@_date: 2018-10-26 12:27:35
any 3rd party wallets are fundamentally anti-btc but its not much different than putting your copyright in the hands of a trust
