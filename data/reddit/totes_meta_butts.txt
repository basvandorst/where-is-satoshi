Hey I was just searching for recent changetip threads and came across yours. Just to be sure, you are talking about the old bot right? the +one, not the new If so, that one was disabled a while ago. If I recall correctly it was run by You could try PM'ing him to ask, or if he has gold maybe he'll see this thread since I mentioned his name.

That's just not true and there are hundreds of people who can verify it was in fact posted by CyanideandMadness.

Nah dude you heard the man you're a drone, and this guy is living proof you can buy large amounts of LSD with Bitcoins. We all have our place in life, better off just accepting it.

If I'm a troll what does that make you? A sociopath? My posting history is quite tame compared to the vitriol you like to spread.

ITT Strangers on the internet get upset because no longer wants to invest in Bitcoin.

Idiocy isn't a fair term in this case. Maybe ignorance, but even then I wouldn't see that as a fault of theirs. Chances are they just don't give a shit about Bitcoin and only know what little they've heard from the media, so blame them.

I'm curious to know exactly how an anarchistic society would play out. Can you recommend any good books detailing this, or cite some historical examples for me to research?

I'll try to answer that one for you. Let me first say I don't doubt your sincerity in what you posted. I'm sure you're really excited about Bitcoins potential like most people around here. The thing is, like clockwork, posts like this get posted and voted to the top of front page anytime the price is in decline. They always mention how the price doesn't matter because "fundamentals". After seeing enough of them over the last couple years my brain just automatically puts them in the "feel-good, pump-post, buy more coinz" filing cabinet. I'd much rather see the price rise due to actual utility and widespread adoption (increase in demand) than to a sometimes irrational, faith-based desire of Bitcoiners to keep buying and hoarding coins no matter the price (decrease in supply). This class of "don't worry about the price" posts only serve to increase the latter. I'm sure someone will come along and call me a troll for answering you but it's my honest opinion. Hope that helps.

Interesting, this is the first I've heard of them doing this. At the very least, you should be allowed to withdraw whatever coins are in the account. Have you ever posted that message here to reddit?

You and I are on the same page there. I don't doubt the kid wrote the essay. I was one of the few who saw the video proof he posted on Youtube before deleting it. I can say with certainty that the child's handwriting matches that of the essay. For me though the teacher's comments were suspect, and the follow-up story was absolute fiction.

Some of the employees get paid through the changetip bot. This may or may not be accounted for in his source, if there is one.

You know what else is funny? I commented on a [days old thread]( a little before making the comment here. A dead two day old thread where I'm trying to be helpful and somehow got a downvote on it lol. Looks like someone just doesn't like when I talk about Changetip.
I'm sure if anyone wants to ask their new PR rep (Victoria?) she'd verify that she gets paid through changetip. I've seen the transactions myself on their site. I've got no problems with that but it does need to be accounted for if we're going to talk about the average tip.

If you have proof that he ever said this you should provide it [here]( as there seems to be some doubt amongst researchers.

You're not, by anyone's standards. You're a voice of reason here and this guy is just an angry extremist.
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:20:04
Did they preemptively ban you or you had an account and they took it away? If the latter, did they say anything to you or just shut it down? Were you able to withdraw your balance?

I'm liking the price on that [lambo]( 1 bitcoin. Quick somebody buy it before they realize their mistake and fix the price.

True, it's your money you can do with it as you wish. No one here can stop you. The way I see it though, it's like going to a public playground and throwing bread crumbs everywhere. It's your bread you can do what you want with it, just know that you're the reason pigeons are coming in and shitting on everything, and they'll keep coming back too.
