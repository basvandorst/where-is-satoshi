I now have insane cred at work and home for urging others to invest in July.

Frame the question this way, the national currency is deflating, what can i do?  Demand to be paid in bitcoin or tag your income to the REAL inflation rate.
Maybe you can estimate your budget in bitcoin for the coming year and buy futures for the whole year today.  For example, if you need 250 mBit a month to live buy a option contract for each month out.  Of course I don't know how small of a contract will be offered on the CME.
Anybody know?

Consider trying Angustora 1919, it's a fine rum.  Edit, Autocorrect hates my rum too.

This is a VERY big deal from the point of view of a business owner.  
Now imagine my business accepts payments in USD and buys in bitcoin.  This condition of my business is called "being naturally short bitcoin".
Purchasing a "call" for next month's bitcoin that will be needed for my raw materials becomes a known today.  So I don't have to raise my prices today to pay for expensive bitcoin next month, I have an option to buy next month at a price fixed today!
What if my business is naturally long bitcoin?  
This is a problem from the business owner's perspective too.  Running a business is full of complexities.  Tax law, employment law, fluctuating regulatory agencies, electrical and building codes... I don't have time to worry about avoiding the dip in currency markets to spend capital.
In this case I can buy a "put" and know about what kind of cash I'll get.  This let's me reduce my risk and push my margins a little lower if necessary.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange really improved the lives of the farmers it served and having BitCoin traded there will improve the currency for everyone.

Thanks for the compliment and you've made another excellent point.  The futures should directly correlate the demand for BitCoin without the risk of government policy.
I'm wondering, though, does that mean the future value of BitCoin will be the (Current BitCoin Value)x(ratio of current to future market share)/(1-reference currency deflation)?

Financial Times
Equities are returning too little in dividend payments, are almost entirely valued based on speculation, and have already priced in the Republican tax cut.  Bonds are also overvalued according to Greenspan.
You're comments lack logic, sources, or creativity.  They're bad and you should feel bad.

Many of the comments in your history are thoughtful, we all get a snarky comment from time to time.  Forget about it!
I agree that bonds are trading way above where they need to be, thus the Greenspan sentence in my reply.  I'm suggesting there's a link to Equities and Bonds being overvalued based on their future income streams.  I also think this is accelerating the evolution of Bitcoin right now. 
IMO the asset glut is due to a dirth of entrepreneurship and the 'recent' trend to create barriers to entry for a business rather than rise to meet competition.  I'll leave the above digression here...

For those of us watching the stock market, the consensus is that equity is experiencing a bubble at the same time.

I totally agree with your primary point.
