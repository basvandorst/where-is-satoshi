If you get 0.56, you are part of the 0.5% (but more accurate maybe 0.8% as it is exponential).

So now the real fight begins. If bitcoin and cryptocurrency market surpases the 1 trillion USD there will attacks from banks all over the world. This was just the begin.
BUT WE WILL SURVIVE! Truth always wins!

All of you mentioned are different decimal numbers. So all are needed, depending on the amount.
1 BTC = 1,000 mBTC = 100,000,000 satoshis.
2030 you will buy a house with in BTC. A car in mBTC. And daily coffee with satoshis. Thats the point.

If you have 1000 BTC of course you will support bitcoin value to get even more value from your 1000 BTC.
So whales are not interested in selling. They want BTC as a world currency to have a higher value for their own BTCs.

The term '21 million club' is every time in the news and already a well known term.
It is also a sign of trust you have invested an amount of your wealth in bitcoin, so you are a supporter of bitcoin. This is different when talking with people who have never used a wallet, but also post here in bitcoin for example or anywhere else.
It is the same reason why there are clubs for car owners, harvard absolvents and yes also 1 million usd clubs.
Not only promote bitcoin, but also to have really invested wealth in it and proof it, is complete different when it comes to talking about the topic.

When you really think about it, it's crazy. Seems we are just at the begin.

Some idea if you will make a next challenge:  
Instad giving 1 person 99%, split it up.
For example with the 310 BTC worth of more then 2m USD, you can give 20000 people 100 USD. Best would be to give people BTC who are not in crypto yet. So if they want to get their 100 USD they need to find out how to install a wallet. This would increase bitcoin adoption.
I don't know how you can do this. As target audience non-tech people would be funny. Send for example letters (not mail, real letters) to random 20000 people trough the world. I know this would be a lot of work, but this would really be awesome if the whole international media gets attention of it and the "whole world" is looking if they got 100 USD for free.  
For all who did not take their BTC (because ofc some letters would never be seen and so on), you can transfer the amount after 1 month and for all of them send new letters.
This could be a real worldwide hype for bitcoin. Imagine like a international worldwide sort of puzzle and seeking who got free bitcoins and how to install a wallet, how to transfer the BTC to another wallet (so they are save, because the people only have 1 month or you will send it to another person). Please do this :)))

Of course they do. Media told them nothing else. Media needs catchy headlines. Do you think someone would read about "there is a decentralizes network, we will explain it now in detail. So ..."

I don't like this case. Bitcoin and crypto is to take away the control of governments and banks. Now if you get wealthy, you need to explain how and offer all bitcoin addresses, all transfers and more? This means, they control you again if they want. If the government wants to find anything corrupt transfers, especially in crypto, they will. They just say "Sorry sir, this papers and crypto transfers does not prove it. There is no central authorization behind!". And you get in jail - case closed.

Ok I just laughed for a second. Then the red bear line had me again. Anyway thanks for the smile.

Selling his own house for bitcoin is really just stupid. This is a classic shilling instead care of the real benefits of bitcoin and crypto. This is why we are dumping even more.

Will be a lot of work to keep it updated with daily newer lows. But appreciate it.

Imagine he would have picked one of the other 99 people he asked and who took bitcoin. Not a very viral video ...

Paper wallets ARE the SAFEST if you use it in the right way. Please do not misslead people here!
One of the worst posts on reddit. Instead of telling how to make a good paper wallet and how safe it can be, this seems like an ad for exchanges or hardware wallets.
Stop missleading people.
