You seem like you're having a delightful time. I'm having a delightful time. You're making this long 
road trip (which I'm sure you could gather I'm on?) a little more entertaining.

Sheesh guy, go back to /v/

I mean, so we're clear here, I was referring to the "I'm an end user who doesn't give a shit about all of this cryptozoology cryptology stuff and I'd be fine with a mere 99....% real-world likelihood against the chance that all my money walks away or I get disappeared because I'm buying drugs in China or whatever and a backdoored build phoned home" case. Like it or not, the intersection between the set of people who have an interest in Bitcoin and people who could actually be arsed to learn PGP is fucking narrow. With widespread saturation comes lusers. Your WoT is great, sure. But that guy is not going to do it. His loss. I gave roughly the same advice when it comes to verifying signatures the Tails devs give.

You can, I guess, but that doesn't mean you should. You decide what's an acceptable risk. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:12:13
Yup, that's exactly it. Option 2 would be to skip creating the WoT, get the key, and verify its full fingerprint in several places, from several computers, at least once using Tor. If you always get the same signing key, you're probably fine. Probably.

Download a distribution of GPG for your platform, and download the certificate referenced in the OP link from several different computers in several different networks (ideally all over https, ideally at least once over Tor) to make sure they're all the same (this slightly mitigates the risk of MITM). 
Using your GPG install, import the Bitcoin core dev certificate, then check the signature that came with your Bitcoin package. How exactly this works will depend on your platform and the package you installed, and could best be described by its manual or some Google searches. You may need to acquaint yourself with your command line. 
If that seems too complicated, frankly, that's because it *is* too complicated for non-developers. If you do decide to set all of this up, it'll be a fun learning experience.

Buddy, I've got some bad news for you. The faith in Bitcoin that gives it in value, broadly, isn't from people who have a fucking clue what good practice is. People will let others hold tens of thousands of USD of their coins for *convenience*. And they lose their money every once in a while. Now I guess you're free to define "into Bitcoin" however you please, but there are users who exist, will move non-trivial amounts of money around, and will lose the money or otherwise get busted doing something dumb. You're free to do whatever you wish, of course, but I'm under the impression that more security is better than zero security. You seem to be under the impression everyone's security practice should approach the best known practice in avoiding threats from global adversaries; all or nothing. In that case, you'd be better off advocating suicide than WoTs. Can't get pwned if you're dead. I'll leave you to fundraise that mass-purchase of Flavor-Aid yourself. If not, go ahead, make it so easy to build a WoT client my grandmother could use it safely. 
The general technological public is bigger than /v/, homie.

You know your shit *and* you're unfamiliar with MITM attacks and gpg? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:05:05
Hahaha, the heck?! 
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:29:24
There's not an "attack" so much as there's suspicion that there will be one. The site there is insinuating that Chinese government attackers might modify the Bitcoin core binaries on their way between them and you. Check the signatures when you download crypto software like Bitcoin.

Making the things look cooler and more worthy of your $12 USD than they actually are. If such a dead-simple attack could foil the whole security model... 
@_date: 2012-12-05 00:17:19
Woo! Nice one!
@_date: 2015-03-28 02:04:25
I'll mod it if you want. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:55:49
Slow down there buddy! Tell us how you _really_ feel.

Solarized Dark is my daily driver color scheme at the moment.

Aw dammit! I missed the crash! Sucks for me...
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:53:20
Interesting. Can you give us a TL;DR on how this works?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:09:16
I'll sell you 1mbtc for 1.6 mbtc!

This is part of why I don't use green-on-black. Too cliché. There's way more visually ergonomic options available anyway.
