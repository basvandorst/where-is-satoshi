Aren't those coins actually worth a ton now as collector items?

Can you explain it please

I’m not sure about everything and I have no data that isn’t anecdotal. But from my experience in the market and the patterns I’ve used to buy and sell, prior to planned hard forks, people tend to mass buy bitcoin causing prices to rise. The intention is to have access to the coin prior to the fork so you get equal parts of both blockchain. That way even if you sell your bitcoin for a loss, you still have a profit from the forked coin. This makes the bitcoin value go up and down, a great time to sell and buy respectively if you know the pattern. It has worked for me in the past

Wait until 11/16 and I’m sure there will be a reflex drop

It’s nice to see someone taking the time to explain things to other users, even if it seems common knowledge.  Even for those of us who knew this, thanks for helping to keep this sub an open and friendly place by looking out for the other folks out there.

I'd be ok with that. Grab a couple more coins

Yea I'm pretty sure it's the same picture some dude posted of a local mom and pop shop.

This is the most useful thing I've seen on the topic in months.

It's been too long since I've seen one of these posts

I was on a thread on Reddit a few days ago giving praise/review for a wallet password recovery guy. The guy had a password written down, but either changed it slightly or wrote it wrong. He paid someone a 20% flat fee to crack the password using what passwords he thought it was and some program he coded. You have a shot!
