I guess bitpay is one of the biggest, but runs "only" on BTC and BCH. coinpayments is another service provider. and in the german and austrian area there are 2-3 service provider they - like bitpay - convert it directly to fiat. of course for a little fee. we will see how this plays out in the market.

sounds great. it's a niche right now, espacially if you're the only one in your area accepting it. in which country you're located? are you holding you btc you earn or do you convert it into fiat right away?

depends on the knowledge of the merchant. also it depends on the currency he/she would like to accept. And if the business is just online or offline. 
For example: Bitpay, Coinpayments, Bitkassa, CoinwayPay, Salamantex
if someone has other recommendations...just add it here

there are some service providers for that. of course it depends on the country your business is located.

good points. there are some service provider for that. In my opinion  will be the biggest gap for adoption. One the one hand merchants have to be educated about using crypto and on the other hand people have to use it. But i guess it's only a question of time.
