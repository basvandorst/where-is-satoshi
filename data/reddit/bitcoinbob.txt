Film festival screenings almost always take place before any sort of release.  One of the main functions of a festival is to get a distributor for a film.  The Rise and Rise got a distributor at it's first festival (Tribeca) and is screening at these other festivals for additional foreign distribution opportunities (as per the film's email list and social media posts).  I think this is a great move forward for the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Education for the masses.

This doc is set to explain Bitcoin in a way that the average person could understand a large part of its benefits, as well as serve as a way to show the "earlier years" of Bitcoin in the long run.  A slice of history which will likely look incredible and unbelievable in the not too distant future.

Also, if fraud becomes a serious problem, stores could start accepting from verified sources to save headaches.  Meaning that you would have an account with a Bitcoin wallet company and be able to pay out of that account which is verified through their app, etc.  That's a worst case scenario, and it's really not all that bad.  Still far cheaper than credit card fees on both sides, and everyone walks away with savings thanks to Bitcoin.

A Pennsylvania crew is making a documentary about Bitcoin and has been spreading the word locally as well!  Check out "The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"

This documentary will be the definitive source of information on the early years of Bitcoin, as well as a way to explain why it's so important and how it works to the average viewer.  Supporting this documentary will support BTC overall, because it will be teaching the masses about Bitcoin and it's importance to the global financial system.

Elon's main financial backers for his ventures (SpaceX and Tesla Motors included) are big Bitcoin enthusiast VC's.  It will only be a matter of time before that will be a reality.  And when I say big enthusiasts, I mean that they are dedicating quite a bit of their workload to supporting Bitcoin start-ups and ventures.  So rest assured, Elon does know about Bitcoin, and I would be willing to bet that you could buy a Tesla with Bitcoin right now if you really put some effort into it.
