which those parents have paid into...what you're really advocating is punishing parents, who don't want to send their kid to the school district assigned to them, by making them pay more to get school choice

The rate of illegal immigration is cyclical and dependent on whether the Mexican economy is good or not. The corrupt Mexican government likes the existence of illegal immigration bc it acts as a release valve to avoid the pressure of an uprising from the lower classes. Their govt allows and even assists their citizens to illegally immigrate by handing out instruction pamphlets on what to bring, the routes, and what to say to avoid being deported.

You sure about that? ISIS fighters travel to Iraq/Syria frm their hometowns in UK, Canada, Netherlands, US, Indonesia, etc...remind me which Indonesian towns were bombed by the US? Regardless, there's no justification for beheading journalists, burning people alive, raping little girls who are arab minorities, killing their fathers and brothers, and enslaving their mothers. Cry me a river for the guy who gives the excuse that he raped and killed an innocent person bc some other person supposedly killed his family. It's most definitely religion that makes them think they can rightfully commit atrocious acts towards innocent ppl (the execution methods are in the scripture and even Al Azhar academics refused to denounce ISIS' actions bc they would be denouncing Islam itself) and if you were familiar w/ the quran/hadiths, you'd know that they are trying to incite and carry out apocalyptic prophecies depicted in their scriptures.

It's expected that there'll be a lot of volatility on the way up. As long as it's rising sideways and up, and not parabolic, then it's unlikely to have huge crashes... there will be pullbacks though. Long term investors will hold through the storm, but traders love getting in the middle of it.

Someone kill me if they make a kardashian coin as another scheme to get richer.

Nope, just slowed the bullet down. I still think the EU won't last, at least the euro. The ECB continues to overextend itself w/ QE and buying up toxic assets all while lecturing the poorer members to go through austerity measures.

I think it's still bullish, but I'd rather not have it go parabolic. That's just going to scare people when they lose money buying it at the top.

I know right?! If you're going to rent space on a billboard, go all out and spell it. Even just using "M" instead of "mln" would be better.

Exactly, wasn't the FBI on record saying that having a public ledger would actually make it easier to catch criminals?
Anyways, it'll be the people in developing countries like my extended family who live in Honduras and SE Asia that will adopt the use of bitcoin... much better appreciating store of value. Plus they don't need to have the transition from a bank to using bitcoin...much like they didn't need a personal landline and the infrastructure required to call someone when cell phones became affordable and widely available.

Le Pen would have brought on the collapse of the EU faster, but Macron, Merkle, Juncker cannot save it...particularly the euro. It's a house of cards and the ECB it becoming dangerously overextended. Personally, I'm glad Macron won...it'll allow me to continue buying up bitcoin while it's still affordable for me.

Based on your chart, it's super cheap right now.

There's been increasingly less volatility since 2013...I could see a pullback of 30-50%. 75% seems unlikely at this point...but if it happens, I'm ready to scoop a bunch of them up :)

Isn't long term capital gains 0% for people earning ordinary income under ~37K? I remember reading about one guy retiring in his 30s after amassing a $2M portfolio. He earned some money on the side, but it was never over the 15% tax bracket, so any distributions he got out was not taxed at all. I'm not sure if there's a limit to that though.

Can ppl pls stop w/ this narrative that groups like ISIS are defending their "homeland." They're not. In ISIS' case, most are invaders coming from Europe, Canada, the US, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc and they are killing the people whose land that belongs to. These lands are also not islamic, which is what these terrorist groups want them to be. They are inhabited by ppl who are multiethnic and multi-religious. 
But yes, I agree it would help if the countries who control geopolitics wouldn't upend secular governments in MENA and exploit religious fundamentalism.
