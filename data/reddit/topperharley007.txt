It is so hilarious that you crypto fan boys / girls think you are so smart but in reality you are FUCKING stupid. If you EXCHANGE a capital asset for another capital asset (crypto for automobile and your technicality that it is going towards a lien won't protect you since the debt is collateralized by a physical automobile) you are still "exchanging" assets and the IRS is sooooo much smarter than you. So smart that in the instructions for form 8949 they cover "The sale or EXCHANGE OF A CAPITAL ASSET". Well before crypto people tried to skirt capital gains by exchanging assets for assets.

Hate to break it to you but there won't be a market clearing interest rate for loans because the opportunity cost for investors is 0% return (HODL) and the opportunity cost for borrowers will be less than 0% (deflation). So you end up with investors who will demand a minimum interest rate of 0% + risk appropriate real interest rate and borrowers will offer no more than -X% + risk appropriate real interest rate.

Banks don't print money out of thin air. Lets walk through the transactions where you find out it is other entities depositing loanable funds at a bank that increases money supply.
\- Saver deposits $100 at a bank. Cash (A) -100; Deposits (A) +100;
\- Bank receives savers $100 deposit. Cash at Fed (A) +10; Cash (A) +90; Customer Deposit (L) +100;
So far no money created. The saver's $100 in money was transfered to th bank.
\- Bank loans $90 to Company1. Cash (A) -90; Loans (A) + 90;
\- Company1. Cash (A) +90; Loan (L) +90;
Still no money created. $90 of the saver's money was transfered to Company1
\- Company1 uses loan to buy machinery from Company2. Cash (A) -90; Equipment (A) +90
\- Company2. Cash (A) +90; Inventory (A) -90;
Still no money created. $90 of the saver's money was transfered to Company2
\- Company2 creates money by depositing the $90 revenue at the bank. Cash (A) -90; Deposits (A) +90;
\- Bank. Cash at Fed (A) +9; Cash (A) + 81; Customer Deposit (L) + 90;
So here is where Company2 - an equipment manufacturer - increased the monetary base by depositing loanable funds at a bank. Company2 could have alternatively bought Treasury Bills / Paid Federal Taxes / Purchased Corporate Bonds / etc with its $90 proceeds from the equipment sale and the monetary base would not have increased.

Debt markets will collapse under crypto with a fixed supply. MV = PQ so if you can get the economy to grow under crypto you get deflation. This means the risk free rate of return is less than 0%. Crypto investors face the choice to HODL (with 0 carrying costs) or lend at a minimum of 0% + risk premium associated with the loan. Crypto borrowers will be willing to borrow at a maximum of risk free rate of return (say -2%) + risk premium associated with the loan. Mathematically speaking there will be no debt markets.

Interesting question. Given that I don't touch crypto it doesn't matter to me personally. If I was gambling on crypto I would consider myself lucky if I get out ahead and define the demise if I take a loss. I view the latter as the more likely outcome because I firmly view the PV of crypto in its current form is 0. The PV will be the terminal value once behavioral economics runs its course.
There is a possible success in all this, but it will not benefit the people actually buying crypto. Block chain is a useful technology, but the initial allocation is being done all wrong. Example: In the US (at least) real estate deeds are managed in arcane fashion - thank the Realtor lobby for this. There is finite land in the continental US and the government could go about building a block chain and assigning crypto to the current owners of land. Future transaction could be done and the realtor middle persons and public notaries will get screwed out of commissions they are collecting.

Further, borrowing / investing in debt instruments would not occur if such conditions were predictable because the risk free rate of return would be -75%. In other words just horde "currency" and do better.

"Then they have to fall back to FDIC is backed by the full faith and  credit of the US government..... which means the US will potentially  have to print money to cover this "
The FDIC fund did go negative during the last recession, so they do go to the Treasury to borrow money until future insurance premiums let them repay the debt. And guess what, we didn't have massive inflation. Why? Because while all you fools decry that lending money and taking it back as deposits increases the money supply, you fail to realize the loan write offs necessary for banks to be unable to pay back deposits DECREASES the money supply and would cause deflationary pressures \- the Fed knows this and has the tools to counteract such deflationary pressure.

Go back to your scare mongering link quoting the $544 trillion in notional derivatives. I quote from the graphic, "Collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps are two derivative types that are now infamous for their roles in the 2008 Financial Crisis.". Now take a guess what percentage of the $544 trillion are the OTC derivatives the misleading graphic cares to highlight? It would be a lot more honest to quote that figure since it really doesn't bother to talk about the other derivatives that make up the majority of the $544 trillion figure.
The fact of the matter is that the majority of the OTC derivatives are in short dated FX and Interest Rate products that get settled by making a present value payment for far less than 0.01&amp; notional. Counterparties require daily collateral posting if the PV moves away from $0. Further, your notional figure double counts derivatives by adding the longs and the shorts. So if I take a $1B position with you as my counterparty it counts as $2B gross notional.

"There are countries with negative rates on bonds, and people holding their currency in the bank need to pay the bank interest for the "privilege" of them holding their money."
Correct. Under the current monetary system it would cost you a significant amount of money to provide security for a few million/billion &lt;insert fiat currency&gt; so you can have negative rates for short periods, particularly if your fiat currency is being managed such that there is deflation. With crypto you eliminated the cost of securing currency so you have eliminated any possibility of negative interest rates.
"You can lend BTC right now on Bitfinex for a DAILY return of about 0.019% in BTC, that's a yearly return of close to 7%! And this is just for margin trading, imagine what the rate could be if someone wanted to borrow up BTC for a business loan"
You realize margin trading is a lot RISKIER than most business loans - I'm talking the multi billion IG Bonds / Loans that get issued daily. The yield on many business loans (by $ value) would not get issued because they are going to be break even at negative interest rates, which above I just pointed out will not exist.

What is the pro of a deflationary currency? Under what conditions will anyone be able to borrow money when the risk-free rate of return is negative?
There is certainly a one size fits all plan generically stated -
1)  Hold $X in a checking account so that you can pay your monthly bills - you will lose to inflation but you are paying the bank for the convenience of quick access to money in a secure location.
2)  Build an addition 2-8 times $X emergency fund that is invested either in online bank savings account, short-term bond mutual fund/ETF or in US Treasuries (will keep up with inflation in the long run)
3)  If you have access to a credit card get one with cash back rewards. Reduce your checking account to $Y for items that cannot be paid with a credit card - like rent in most cases - and float 0% interest borrowing on all other purchases while you hold the money in an account described in point 2 with a maturity a few days before the credit card bill is due.
4) Once 1-3 are complete then you get into more complicated long-term savings plans that are unique to the entities goals in life.

I was straightforward you just need to understand what interest rates are.
I am going to operate in a world where the human condition gets better, populations increase and the economy grows. This is the world we live in.
If you fix the money supply (the crypto's dream) you will end up with deflation - I think we can agree on that based on your comment. Whatever the rate of deflation is, let us say -2.5%, is the risk-free rate of return. No bank in their right mind will pay deposits better than -2.5% interest and no consumer in their right mind will make deposits for less than 0% interest. So the equilibrium is no deposits.
Beyond deposits, you can shut down the entire IG Corporate Bond/Loan sector with -2.5% deflation. A company that will borrow up to but no more than 2.49% real interest rate will not find a market because investors will sit on their currency and earn 0% nominal return instead.

And the value will never stabilize. The USD is a stable store of wealth in part because we have a market (US Treasuries) that allow one to trade a USD today for a computed amount of USD in the future. If you tried to do this with crypto - a naturally deflationary "currency" - the crytpo equivalent of a 4-week Treasury bill would perpetually have a negative yield. Such a market will never exist because it is superior to HODL.

Federal inheritance tax only kicks in when the deceased leaves behind more than $11.4 MILLION. If you leave behind less than that you owe $0 in federal inheritance taxes. That is a 0% tax rate. The 40% federal tax rate only applies on inheritance OVER $11.4 MILLION. So if your estate is $12 MILLION you pay 40% times ($12 MILLION - $11.4 MILLION) , so $24,000 or an average tax rate of 0.2%.

Except that doesn't solve the problem. Businesses have to prepare financial statements (and pay taxes) in local fiat currency. If you buy your inventory (COGS) on the first of the month and then do a sale on the 10th of the month there are two options:
1. Your sales price is fixed in local fiat currency. That means the Bitcoin price your consumer pays on a day to day basis changes - think if your monthly rent fluctuated up / down 20% every month because you save in a "currency" different from what the rental owner files taxes.
2. Your sales price is fixed in crypto. That means your inventory costs will be based on the crypto / local fiat rate from the first of the month while your revenue will be based on the rate th 10th of the month.

I get that BitPay is like Visa. But that has nothing to do with the problem I'm citing. Your response to my first post suggests you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a balance sheet and an income statement if your life depended on it. So let me try to be more explicit with some actual numbers and I'm going to pick a notoriously low margin business - Gas Stations (the petrol sales part of the business anyway; inside a gas station margins are huge).
\*using round numbers so I can do mental math
Monday the tanker makes a petrol delivery at the gas station. The business pays $3.00 / gallon. Crypto is 10 units per dollar that day. Tuesday Crypto moved 10% to 11 units per dollar. Now here are the gas stations options:
1. Current state. Only accept dollar. Only deal in dollar. Charge $3.03 a gallon retail. Earn $0.03 a gallon so long as you move your inventory and pay your taxes on that profit margin.
2. Business keeps internal state at current state only operating in dollar but accepts crypto through BitPay. Retail price is fixed at $3.03 to set profit margin. Consumer buying with crypto would have either paid $3.03 X 10 crypto units on Monday (30.3 crypto) but will now instead pay $3.03 X 11 crypto units on Tuesday (33.33 crypto). Under this condition crypto is not acting as a currency.
3. Business tries out crypto as currency for internal affairs. Uses BitPay to spend its crypto (30 units per gallon on Monday) and sets the retail price at the same markup from the other two examples at 30.3 units per gallon. For financial statements the gas station will show that its expense for buying the gas at $3.00 a gallon (by law it must produce financials / tax statements in local fiat) and for its Tuesday sale price it will show 30.3 units per gallon / 11 crypto per dollar or $2.75. So the gas station will show a loss of $0.25 per gallon even though it spent 30 units of crypto on inventory and sold the petrol for crypto for 30.3 units.
4. Any combination of managing inventory purchases in one currency and retail sales in another and combination of holding dollar or crypto on your balance sheet suffers from the issue with option 3.
The fluctuation of crypto / fiat cuts both ways when choosing option 3 or 4. A gasoline station is in the business of buying petrol and selling it, not watching its margins expand and disappear because of changes in a crypto / fiat rate.

Not really. If you are a gas station and you buy your inventory using Bitcoin on Day 1 when it is X USD / BTC, and you sell your inventory the subsequent days accepting BTC when it is 0.90 * X USD / BTC you can easily owe corporate taxes greater than your profit with what Ohio is offering.

"With bitcoin being deflationary and if demand only ever stayed the same with a growing or relative stable"
I understand that MV = PQ. I've forgotten more mathematical equations that model the economy than you have ever known. Deflationary "currencies" fail and will never be adopted. One major issue is  all debt markets will collapse under a deflationary currency. For example, the equilibrium real interest rate (that is the quoted nominal interest rate less inflation) for investment-grade corporate bonds is around 1%. If you fix your currency supply and the global real GDP grows at 2.5% that means you will experience -2.5% inflation (aka deflation). Thus, investment-grade corporates will only be willing to borrow at -2.5% + 1% = -1.5%. Problem is, no investor is going to lend money at -1.5% when you can HODL for a 0% return.
This disconnect will exist no matter what the equilibrium real interest rate for the debt product.

2)  You hold to maturity, figure out what the value of the futures contract is, contact your trading partner, make a cash payoff and tear up the contract with no effects on supply.
3) You hold to maturity, the short position goes to the physical market buys the underlying, delivers the underlying to the long who in turn makes cash payment based on the futures contract.
Going back to the original post I responded to, there is no 'conterfeiting' whatsoever. There is no effect on supply.

"Be your own bank"
So when you invest your assets you are going to do the credit evaluation on your own? You're going to be willing to enter into agreements such as you'll lend $X today and they will pay you back $Y per month for the next Z months and you will have no recourse to call the loan early BUT the borrower will have the opportunity to pay you back early?
And that doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what you are claiming you will start doing.

I see you don't understand the math you are up against so let me put it out there. Your fixed supply currency is deflationary, at about -3% a year is a good long run estimate. Borrowers will be willing to do so at -3% + the appropriate real interest rate. Lenders can HODL for 0% return so they will be willing to lend at 0% + the appropriate real interest rate. Absolutely no borrowing occurs.

Maybe you ought to go do some math. Take $100 investment from 1980 and compute how much money you would have if you had invested in rolling 3-month Treasury Bills between then and now. Take the amount of money you have now and use the rate of inflation to deflate it back to 1980 dollars. You might learn something then.
Also, I know my personal return on assets over several decades. Guess what, I beat inflation and then some because (and this is a secret only people working for the Deep State are aware of) asset prices over time account for expected inflation.

"higher potential to effect changes in many aspects of human life"
The best I can come up with is to completely destroy debt markets. Here is an example:
US IG Corporate Bonds trade at a real yield of about 1&amp; (100 bps). Real GDP is growing north of 2&amp; thus in a BTC world deflation is roughly 2&amp; thus the risk free rate of return is -2&amp; US IG Corporates will be willing to borrow at most -1&amp; No one will lend for less than 0&amp; as HODL is superior. Further, because lenders can HODL they will demand 0&amp; + 100bps to lend to IG Corporates. IG Corporate Bond market collapses.
You can replace US IG Corporate Bonds with any debt market and the whole thing collapses under crypto.

"Well according to some on here, credit would die under the Bitcoin standard which is good in their eyes"
Those are some of the dumbest people in the world. Case in point. Person A owes $1k rent in 2 days. Person A gets paid $2k in 5 days. Person A gets evicted if rent is not paid in 2 days. Person A should simply be evicted if they don't have $1k in liquid assets?
"But then, according them, under that system everything you would buy with credit would reduce in cost exponentially"
More of the same kind of stupid. It means that production of these goods/services will plummet. That is part of recessions, credit dries up and demand drops causing producers to reduce output.
One more obvious example. You just graduate from school and get your first job. This job requires that you drive yourself to work. You don't have $18k in liquid assets - it is your first job and you didn't win the sperm lottery and born into wealth so you have $0 in liquid assets so any price drop in cars does you no good. You either A) not take the job because you can't buy a car outright or B) you realize the ROI on borrowing money to buy a fixed asset that is an investment that should be depreciated over time and payoff the loan as if the benefit of the car is its ability to get you to work as make you money.

Treasury Bills are debt instruments sold by the US Treasury and accessible to anyone with $100 to invest. In the long run they pay interest to compensate for inflation - and since 1980 have provided a better return than holding gold. In the short run, the interest on US Treasuries may be above or below the rate of deflation depending on the current state of monetary policy.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:19:07
You need to revisit CAPM model. US T-bills are risk free. No reason they should yield more than inflation in the long run. Interest should only be taxed in excess of the interest that represents inflation, but the general population is too stupid to handle this. Case in point, the moron that thinks "Interest (on T-bills) is supposed to reward you for saving, not merely maintain your purchasing power".
FYI, rolling T-bills from 1980 to today gave you a better return than buying gold.

Let's be clear here. The US has setup a tax collection system where businesses are responsible for the physical transaction of tax payments to the government on behalf of households (employer income tax withholding, sales tax, phone / utility taxes, etc). So while the typical ignorant household - like your own - might not recognize the importance of fiat as the means to pay taxes there are entities that do recognize this importance. We call them businesses. And because of this businesses will stick with fiat.

So you are saying that EVERY business that has ever gone bankrupt was "irresponsible and greedy" with investor money? Just trying to understand how to apply this OPINION more generally.


So now everyone needs to be properly educated to underwrite loans - one of the primary functions of banks.


That is flat out false. Depositors prefer FDIC insurance to the alternative of doing their own financial analysis of several bank's quarterly financial reports to determine the yield they should demand for an overnight loan to a bank - the large banks wouldn't be hurt as much because you could look to the CP market - that is Commercial Paper if you are not familiar with banking lingo.
FDIC insurance means depositors don't need to accrue yield to compensate for default risk. The FDIC bears this risk. The FDIC and OCC employ financial professionals that can accurately assess bank balance sheets.

In wonkish circles that is referred to as rollback equilibrium. Now apply this theory to fiat money. Someone is offering me fiat currency in exchange for my services. I look X transactions in advance and see this fiat currency is being used by entity ABC to pay taxes so ABC doesn't go to jail, who got that fiat currency from a customer, who got that money from a bank who got that money from me.
