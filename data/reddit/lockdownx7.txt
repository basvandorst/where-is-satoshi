Whether it's feasible depends on the on-chain fees, and the transaction volume you're planning on working with. Opening a channel to make a couple of small transactions won't be worth it if the channel open fee overshadows that, so naturally you'd prefer to route around somewhere else, which centralized hubs facilitate.

LN is peer-to-peer by design, but unless the fees for opening/closing a channel drop down to a reasonable level, LN users will inevitably opt for having just 1 channel linked to a massive well-connected hub, rather than maintaining channels to everyone they regularly transact with. It'll look a lot more like a server-client model than a peer-to-peer network.

How does LN make exchanges obsolete?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:04:58
Malleability is fixed by making signatures not affect the transaction's ID. Segwit includes this fix, but only for Segwit transactions (because it was implemented as a soft fork). Non-Segwit transactions still have malleability issues, because to fix those, we'd need a hard fork.
In other words, we could have rolled the malleability fix and the block size increase to 2 MB into a single hard fork, and would have ended up with a much more usable Bitcoin that's fully ready for LN, with none of the convoluted garbage Segwit brings along with it. But the community was told that a hard fork and/or block size increase would somehow be the death of BTC, so here we are, with an implementation that delivers less usefulness to the protocol than we'd otherwise get, while still bringing the same problems as a block size increase.
As for ASICBoost, it does address that, but a much bigger concern is how centralized the mining is currently. Could be fixed with a PoW change (which incidentally would fix ASICBoost as well) but once again, an 'evil' hard fork is required so that's not gonna happen either.

Whether it's counted as 1/4 or not at all, it doesn't matter for his point, it's still a silly hack. The bytes are all stored anyway, so it essentially amounts to the same effect as increasing the block size, while being a lot more convoluted for absolutely no reason, and requiring software implementations to be updated to support it. 
The transaction bottleneck could have been eased up swiftly by simply increasing the block size to 2MB, with no action required by wallets/exchanges/etc, but we were somehow assured and convinced that Segwit would be a better solution, despite not being compatible with existing software, and taking up as much as 2 to 4 MB if 100% of the transactions in a block are using Segwit. Any risk of centralization we could have been exposed to by increasing the block size to 2 MB, we are already exposed to by having Segwit.

Amusingly, they have a surprisingly consistent record of calling the wrong shots, an investor wouldn't do too badly by just doing the opposite of what they say.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:00:49
Ah, alright. That was my first guess but I couldn't make sense of it, hence my asking.
So if inflation (in small amounts, like you say) indicates consumer demand for goods, and a government affects inflation via control of supply (i.e: printing money), doesn't that imply that if the inflation were to be bumped from 2% to 3%, consumer demand for goods would increase along with it?
Because that sounds wrong to me. The government doesn't have a magic lever to control how strongly I want to buy stuff, all it can do is control how much I value its money. Sure, making it less valuable could entice me to spend it more, but it could instead convince me to convert it to something that isn't bleeding value so profusely, like for example, another country's currency that has a lower inflation rate. If enough people opt for the latter, doesn't the end result effectively hurt the economy instead of stimulating it?
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:55:25


But only by reducing the value of my money, right? Does that actually continue working when enough people start pouring their money into stores of values that don't move the economy, or does that mean bad news for inflationary currencies over the longer term?


That may be so, but only to a certain extent. I think it'd be fantastic to live in a world where wealthier people spend more proportionally, causing wealth to get redistributed evenly, but the reality is billionaires of today have way more money than they could ever feasibly spend, and there's a reason why the rich are getting richer and the poor getting poorer.


Honestly, this sounds suspiciously like Trickle-down economics. It's all well and good to say inflation causes businesses to flourish, but literally no one I know has ever received a fatter pay check just because the company is performing well; those profits simply get funneled to the owners, not passed down. It makes sense that it works this way, too: my worth as an employee isn't based on how well the company is doing, but rather on how valuable it considers my labour. And that value has been steadily decreasing for years, not increasing like you're claiming. With automation right around the corner, it's only going to get much worse.
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:26:28
That doesn't really answer my question. Let me try an example:
- In a 2% inflation economy, you use your money to make investments with a return of 3% a year. (effectively a 1% return, considering inflation)
- In a 0% inflation economy, you use your money to make investments with a return of 1% a year. (effectively a 1% return)
You're saying one reduces incentive to use your money, while the other doesn't, despite both yielding better returns than just sitting on your money. Do you understand what I'm asking now?
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:48:29


How come it's apparently easy to keep it at around 2%, then? Aren't they just printing enough dollars so that things cost 2% more than they did last year? 


Well, I highly doubt you're saying that people would stop buying food and other products that improve their quality of life, just because their money isn't chipping away value every year. So, I believe that when you say spend, you're referring to things like investing. Which brings me to: why would people stop investing in a 0% inflation economy? If I have money available and investments give me a profitable return per year, how is that not incentive to spend?
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:45:41


Alright, that makes sense in a deflationary economy, but why does it apply to a 0% inflation economy? You're getting no benefit for having your cash sitting still in a pile, you still want to invest it to make money. The only difference I can see between a 2% and 0% inflation economy is that for the former, you want your investment returns to be higher than 2% a year, whereas for the latter, any percentage of returns is already a net positive. What am I missing here?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:43:36
I'd be quite happy to hear your explanation. I know why it's bad in an inflationary economy, I'm just not quite convinced those problems apply in a non-inflationary one.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:12:14


Well, that's what said as well. Frankly, it's concerning that the current economic model is apparently made so convoluted that it can't even be explained in layman terms, and citizens are expected to simply trust those in power that this is all entirely in their best interests. Any discussion about economic reform seems to invariably get shot down with "it's complicated", without ever offering a clear explanation of what tangible benefit one gets for having their savings chipped away by 2% every year.
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:23:01
To someone who admittedly knows little about the topic, could you explain why a currency with a 0% inflation rate causes hoarding? I understand it in regards to deflationary currencies, because you'll get more out of your money for buying something next year instead of today. But with 0% inflation, it's going to be the same price regardless, so what reason do people have to hold off instead of buying the things they need to improve their quality of life?
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:52:27


Of course not. Mostly because your example is ridiculous: The things I need a car for could most likely wait a day, and no currency would realistically have a consistent deflation rate of 100% per day.
Let's try a slightly more sane example though: $10,000 car today or $9,000 next year. Personally, I'd buy it today, the extra cost is very much worth the convenience factor, compared to having to make do without a car for a whole year.
Sure, I'd probably be a bit more mindful of what I throw my money at when said money isn't a hot potato of ever-decreasing value, but it's not like I'd stop spending it on things that improve my quality of life. In my eye, companies providing products/services that consumers truly want would be just fine.
Of course, I'm not an economist by any definition, and I realize there are very likely ramifications I haven't even considered. All I'm saying is, your particular argument for "deflation=bad, inflation=good" doesn't sound convincing at all.
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:14:50
I'm not seeing why that's a bad thing. Is it really so horrible that people no longer drown themselves in debt to buy a house? With a non-inflationary currency, you actually *can* save money effectively, since it's not pissing away 2% of its value every year, so loans aren't as much of a necessity. Sure, you'd still have the option to take a loan if you wanted to make a purchase you can't afford, but it wouldn't be incentivized like it is in an inflationary economy.
@_date: 2018-05-15 15:21:45


Yes, that was entirely my point. For example, String theory is an incredibly complex topic, yet it can still be explained in layman terms in a couple of minutes, so that even someone without a physics PhD can understand why it exists, and what it sets out to do. Yet apparently economics requires an intro course to answer one simple question. Are economics really more complex than theoretical physics now?
I'm sure you can see why I'd be skeptical, and inclined to assume you either don't know the answer, or the answer wouldn't support your side of the argument.

Wat. 
Kraken doesn't have a BTC/USDT pair. If you wanna buy BTC, you need to trade your tethers for real USD first by using their USDT/USD pair. When Tether implodes, the USDT/USD pair will go to zero and whoever is holding tether at the time will be shit out of luck.
With that said, I agree tether collapsing will wreck the markets, but it's not for the reason you're stating.

That's basically it, but you're describing going long, not short. Short is when you borrow someone's assets and sell them immediately with the intent of buying them back later at a lower price, taking the difference as profit.

Story of my life. Bought a bit of BTC when it dipped 2% earlier, took profit when it recovered, now I'm going *"oh... well how 'bout that..."* watching it rocket up. But, suppose I should be glad I wasn't shorting it, and still got a bit of profit out of it.

So if 70% of the hash rate agreed on a protocol change and started mining that chain, it wouldn't be BTC?
What makes it BTC if not the hashpower behind it, then? Admin access to the GitHub repo? ��
