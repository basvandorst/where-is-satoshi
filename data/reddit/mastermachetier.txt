So the work around I found was to find a VPN provider that does not log any info and has multiple users on the same ipaddress on top of that their payment system is separate from VPN so different username and password. Add to the fact I pay with bitcoin although I know now its traceable, but it does not directly tie my info to the billing account. Also all I am doing is torrenting I am not hacking anything or trying to find hitmen.

Is there a way to be fully hidden?

I use a local credit union and citizensbank. I was able to get citizensbank to work after calling them and telling them it wasn't fraudulent.  I see the transaction in the block chain. Out of curiosity how long till i should see it pop in my wallet ?

cool. In the future I should look at the cash app. I saw some posts on it recently and wasn't super sure it could be trusted.

That is my next attempt. Turns out my bank blocks bitcoin transaction as fraudulent by default. I am on the phone with them now trying to get it resolved. I am going through coinmama right now. Fingers crossed. I have literally been trying to get this shit resolved since this afternoon.
