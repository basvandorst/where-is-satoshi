This is really poor. 


There *are* other coins that do *exactly* what bitcoin does. They're worthless though because bitcoin was first. Not a myth.


I don't think I've heard anyone argue that but that to one side 


They didn't do a lot of rising last year.


The author concedes this is actually true! Not a myth.


This is also true surely? Their only value is their usefulness. Not a myth.


Don't think I've heard anyone argue that

As someone mentioned in an earlier post I think using the phrase 'World Wide Ledger' encapsulates possibly the most important aspect for newbies.

In seriousness though. If the goal for bitcoin is widespread consumer adoption, micropayments etc etc the article makes a pretty compelling case that a cartel of major powers (eg. USA, The EU, China, Japan etc.) could use legal muscle to get rid of it as soon as they felt significantly threatened by it (bear in mind a very large chunk of tax revenues come from financial services). It wouldn't even be that hard to sell to the public ("Bitcoin used by Terrorists and Paedophiles" etc etc). I sincerely hope that doesn't happen but as I say the article makes a compelling case and I haven't seen a decent argument as to why they couldn't or wouldn't.

Then you'll have no problem explaining how that is an 'anti-state reference'. Seems more anti-bank if anything
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:09:55
Yeah well that's like your opinion man

It's not so much the use of emotion I have a problem with (though I do have a problem with it!), it's more the tone of (blinkered) revolutionary hero. 
I agree bitcoin has potential to change a lot of things and am personally invested in it. On the other hand it seems equally likely that while the ideas it incorporates will stick around, bitcoin itself could dwindle to worthlessness. 
IMO if it is to be adopted it needs to be seen as a useful technology by the wider public - divorced from political ideology. Associations with anarchism and by extension 'anonymous', pirate bay, tor etc etc stir up bad connotations and make it easier to pigeonhole bitcoin as 'the currency of piracy/terrorism/paedophiles' etc.(I was responding to the point on "sound economics and the logic of market anarchism" and complaints of statism when I mentioned ancap - that may have been unfair).

Is that it? Seems a bit of a stretch
@_date: 2014-12-19 10:40:04
That is one tortured metaphor. Are you trying to draw parallels between bitcoin and humanism??
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:19:15
Oh dear
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:41:05
Well they could ban it couldn't they? While that wouldn't prevent people using it to transfer person to person it would stop legal purchases from legitimate firms surely?

"Stop worshiping the state"..."You're going to have to pick a side, whether you like it or not. "..."I'll wake you up at the next government intervention to distort and hamper the bitcoin market; just to once again say: "I told you so"."
All comes across IMO as self-aggrandising adolescent claptrap. Part of a wider worrying conspiracy theory / semi-religious trend in this sub that Bitcoin WILL change everything (it might) and any criticism of it must be either trolling or paid shilling. If we're looking for wider adoption by the general public, this self important attitude (including advocating 'ancap' for crying out loud) isn't really going to help.

Interesting. Without trying to be confrontational I'm not sure what your wider point is (if you have one - you might just be providing info). Satoshi's white paper certainly isn't anarchist. Conversely the internet (or Darpanet at least) was developed for the military. We don't need to share or advocate their philosophy to use the technology.
@_date: 2014-12-19 14:15:52




Any evidence on either of those claims? Genuinely interested.
@_date: 2014-12-19 11:09:00
I see what you're saying. We disagree (in particular about pirate bay being 'right' but we might not want to open that can of worms.) but I'm glad we can be civil about it.

Well inflation has a [very specific meaning]( in finance. Assuming you just meant that there are 11% more bitcoins than last year, why is that good? and what does 'show me a bank where you get this rates' mean in this context?
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:05:34
Heh heh. Poor OP. Inflation and constant price means the **exact opposite** of what he/she thinks.
