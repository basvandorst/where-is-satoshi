Yeah, i've tried them and that's basically still the story and localbitcoins is a rip off, price-wise.
Essentially, if you want to get your coins fast, anonymous and without someone knowing who you are: go to Serpicoin.com, they have a zero-verification policy on any order size.

There are plenty out there that will do the job, yet compleyepy throw your privacy out the window. Just what is the point of buying anonymous crypto if you have to register with your name and ID. Basically nakes your coins tainted IMO.
Coinbase used to allow quite a bit of coins to be bought before they would nail you with a verification process hat took days. Personally: go to Serpicoin.com, they are located in Switzerland and have a zero-verification policy, and they deliver within 24 hours.

If you like your identity exposed by verifying yourself and sending them all your information and documents that would make identity theft the logical easy next step, sure. Coinbase is awesome if you don't care about your privacy.
Personally, especially when it comes to money, it's nobodys business what i do financially. 
Again coinbase used to skip the verification process some times, not anymore. The only place you can buy crypto with your credit card without verification is Serpicoin.com.

Depending on your location, you may get a crap price or completely scammed. Just go to a european/swiss intermediary (why Swiss/EU you ask? because the US laws don't apply there) that will process your BTC/CC purchase without verification (coinbase.com and serpicoin.com come to mind)

a less complicated way is to pick a swiss/european intermediary such as serpicoin.com, or coinbase. both work, I believe serpicoin doesn't even check your ID. Hope it helps
