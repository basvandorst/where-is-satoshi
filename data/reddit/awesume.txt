How was it strong? Comparing one year performance of bitcoin with a diversified stock market index? As much as I believe in bitcoin, it's apples and oranges here. For example, everyone is pretty sure S&amp;P will continue to deliver it's 10% on average in the long term. With bitcoin we'll have to see.

The US inflation is not equal to USD inflation. The US exports inflation abroad by paying for imports in US dollars.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing to gain from ETH crashing. On the contrary, I still hold some ETH for speculation.
But it's simply amazing to me how delusionally hyped the eth space is for a platform with nearly no utility.

A database offers exactly the same guarantees as a centralized blockchain, only 100x cheaper, simpler and less hyped.

Why the hell would you need a freaking blockchain to do that. This is beyond stupid if true. Private blockchains make no sense.

I know how blockchains work. It's not fucking rocket science. Which is why it's obvious that private chains make no sense.
A blockchain **is** no more than a distributed, trustless database.
When a blockchain is controlled by a single entity, which is the case with a private chain, it is no more and no less immutable that any other database. 
FYI, international money transfers have worked just fine since a fucking hundred years ago. Without blockchains. They are just monopolized, therefore crappy for the most part.

Good for you man I'm thinking of doing exactly the same. Though I'm not sure exchanging if for Bitcoin is a good move right now.

Soon enough the US authorities will crack down on ETH's killer app -
 ICOs. Then we will realize it's true price potential LOL.
