Dollars aren't work.  The type of people that you describe providing work for dollars aren't the people with the dollars. The dollar has value because we agree that it does and we use it.

Taxes are a shitty part of life, and for thr most part they are outright theft. However, that is not why the dollar has value.  The top few people own the majority of the wealth and they aren't working for their money, it's the other way around.

I'm Canadian.  The US Dollar has value and I pay 0 American taxes.  the US Dollar has more value that local currency in many countries and they all pay no taxes to the US government.  By your logic, if taxation were to stop, the dollar would have no value.  If taxes went up, the value of a dollar would go up.

I live in Toronto and am in the same boat.  The fact that I'm allowed to own a house is because of capitalism.
You are confusing a lot of things with capitalism.  Capitalism isn't the relentless pursuit of wealth at all costs, capitalism is simply personal control of your wealth.  That's it.  I think we will find a lot to agree on when it comes to runaway corporate greed, poor housing regulations, crony capitalism, and lobbying. 
However, you are a capitalist.  You believe in having control over your own wealth and assets.  You are free to use your money as you see fit.  You have access to the free market.  You can choose which grocery store to shop at and that grocery store can choose what products to put on their shelves.  That is capitalism.  The problem that you and I gave when it comes to housing is both lack of regulation and too much regulation at the same time.

If Bitcoin was the currency of the world it wouldn't change in value since there wouldn't be much to value it against.  Other coins would change in relation to it.  
People could be paid in Bitcoin.  They could potentially be paid in other coins, or fiat that base their value on Bitcoin.

1) Keep it and pay taxes on the gains.
2) Very.... overall.  There will be dips and spikes.  It is still somewhat in it's infancy.  The swings can be pretty huge and you may have to wait it out. 
3) That is up to you.  The general rule is don't put in more than you are willing to lose.  
All-in-all I'd offer to take Bitcon, but take it at a premium.   Right now it is worth $11,500 USD, which is at an all time high.  Maybe say you will take 1 bitcoin at $10k or $10.5.  Odds are that this guy has been holding it for a long time and bought in at a much lower rate.  Hell, if he has been holding for a month he is killing it.  
If you take it, diversify.  Take some out in cash.  Leave some in BTC and start looking at the alt-coins.  
Really, as far as tax goes, as long as you don't put it on an exchange or turn it in to cash it never happened.  Not legally, but effectively.

If Bitcoin continues to increase in value at it's current rate it is better to hold.  If it stabilizes, it is best to pay off debt then buy back in.  If it tanks, you definitely would have been better off paying off debt.

Do you not want to own a house? Any thoughts on starting a business? Do you like Bitcoin? It is the free market in its purest form.  
Capitalsm is simply that trade is controlled by private entities.  That's it.  Would you prefer to trade Bitcoin on a single government controlled exchange where the government sets the rules like how much coin you can exchange and at what rates? No? You are a capitalist.  
Capitalsm has brought more people out of poverty than any other system in history.  It give people authority over their own property. 
You probably don't like crony capitalism. This is where the rich control the market not through the success of their business but their ability to exert power over government.

Let me fix that for you: The dotcom bubble was caused (from what I know) by mostly young people with little to no knowledge about the companies they were SPECULATING in, thus creating a bubble.
At least the companies that they were buying in to had some real value: They had assets, products, revenue....
Bitcoin at the moment is entirely speculative.  When people were backing RIM, the were speculating on the future success of blackberry.  There was a real value to RIM based on it's assets and sales.  The stock was inflated because of speculation.  Who could have know that the iphone would murder blackberry?
Bitcoin is different of course in many ways, but it's value is based more on speculation than it's value.  It doesn't have a lot of use right now, but I think it (or another crypto) will.  Others believe that too.  They speculate that it will have use and therefor value.

What if your ISP opens up a coin exchange and you are free to exchange within it.  That exchange charges 4% to load fiat and takes 3% of all transactions.  It blocks access to all other exchanges and blocks any encrypted traffic unless you pay an extra $20 per month to enable that "security feature"? You can also just pay another $20 per month to free up to 10 of your favorite sites from their block.

QuadrigaCX has better rates.  In either case you don't technically need a wallet.  You will get a wallet address with them to move money around.  Without a wallet you do not control the private keys so when there is a fork, it is up to the Exchange if they are going to support it.  Coinsquare did not support Bitcoin Gold for example.  
I'm looking for a better exchange too.  When I find the right one I will fund QuadrigaCX with Canadian, turn it in to Litecoin, then use Litecoin to get it on to another exchange quickly.  From there I can then convert again to something else.  I'll eat some fees, but neither Coinsquare, nor Quadriga are great for trading. They have just the most basic features and going to sleep can cause you to lose money.

Yes.  The easiest way would be to manipulate value by limiting access to exchanges.  If all of the USA suddenly had no access to online exchanges, that would stop the pumping of money from the US in to fiat.  
What if access to mining pools were blocked?
You could get around it by using a VPN, assuming that too isn't blocked.

It's relative.  I spend $15 on beer pretty regularly.  Not enough to keep a Lambo on the road, but I spend a fair amount.  A Lambo is about $200k.   A few weeks 
 ago that would have been 10 btc.  Today however, more than 20.   If you had bought 1000 btc when they were worth nothing, and you could cough up 10 of those for the car of your dreams then why not? If you had, you would be better off than holding your coin.  Lambos don't drop in value like a Chevy. 
People spend all sorts of money on shit that they don't need.  How much you spend depends on how much money you have and how much you want that thing.  There was definitely a time in my life when spending $15 on beer wasn't possible.

Just checked it out.  Current BTC:
1 BTC = 0.00 USD
must be some glitch.  
Their price is 7715 CAD, but with the current value of the Canadian dollar it should be about $7460 based on the US dollar value of $5985.  Is this normal to have a Canadian penalty like this?
I refreshed and got this rate:
1 BTC = 11775.78 USD
which doesn't fill me with confidence.

The rates today were shit compared to the others I was looking at.  I think if I am verified on a couple of exchanges I should have some options.  I don't plan to do a lot of trading until I know what I'm doing, or at least think I know what I'm doing.
