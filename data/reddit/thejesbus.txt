Whether LN on top of BTC works as a scaling solution depends on what your goals are:
* Do you want worldwide adoption? (e.g. hundreds of millions or billions of users)
* Do you want people to hold their own private keys? (instead of using only custodial wallets)
* Do you want the lightning network to be decentralized? (instead of most people connecting to a few major hub nodes)
* Do you want to keep the current BTC block size limit?
Every user needs to confirm at the very least 1 on-chain transaction to open their first channel. If the main chain can confirm 6 transactions per second, and you want to open 5 billion channels, it would take at least 5000000000 / 6 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = 26 years of full blocks just to get everyone started with only 1 channel. Even that is way too optimistic, because channels are being closed and re-opened and there's going to be other non-LN traffic on the main chain. This brings the bare minimum time required just to onboard all the lightning users well into the 100s of years.
If you want decentralization, every user will need to have multiple open channels. This brings the the onboarding time required close to or into the 1000s of years.
For these simple reasons it is absolutely impossible to reach all four goals listed above with LN+BTC. You have to choose:
* Not targeting global adoption
* Most people using custodial wallets instead of holding their own private keys
* A hub-and-spoke network topology
* Raising the block size limit

Haha xD
I saw about a hundred people there opening about 1 ticket every 5 seconds.
That's 20 SHA256^2 per second.
You need 700 billion of these rooms for one Antminer S9.
Now imagine an entire datacenter full of bitcoin miners...
The total bitcoin network consists of 175 quadrillion of these rooms

I'm sorry that happened to you!
Here's how I do it:
- Find a few well-known and widely trusted web pages that can generate hexadecimal private keys and convert hexadecimal private keys to addresses
- Download these pages
- Disconnect from the internet
- Open the pages in private browsing mode
- Generate a random hexadecimal private key
- Manually change a bunch of the digits of the private key. You can use dice, or just think of random numbers.
- Write the address &amp; private key on a piece of paper (double, triple &amp; quadruple check)
All the scripts should generate the same address when given the same private key. If one of them is fraudulent, you will immediately notice because it will generate a different address from the same private key.
Preferably: Make sure you don't have any viruses and no human or digital eyes are watching you.
Even more preferred: Use a cheap computer that will never connect to anything. (airgapped)

The various lightning devs really need to do something to proactively warn people. Of course, a proper backup solution is necessary. But before that, maybe some way to check whether the user is trying to broadcast old channel states. For example, simply ask the channel partner what the last state was.
Restoring from backup is a very normal thing when working with computers.
Your Minecraft server crashed? Restore from backup.
You accidentally deleted your database table? Restore from backup.
Your Windows installation got corrupted? Restore from a restore point. (which is basically a backup)
Yes, users should RTFM, but this is like selling a car and writing in the instruction manual that it will explode when making a left turn, even though all other cars only explode when making right turns. You should write that shit in big red letters on the steering wheel.

Because we're mostly libertarian. We don't see more government law &amp; regulation as the solution to problems created by government law &amp; regulation. (problems like the ISP monopolies)

Can you please boost my Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash transactions? Oh wait, never mind... xD

They've been having problems for sooo long now... They always say they're working on 'infrastructure upgrades'. Well I haven't noticed any change over the past few years. Orders not going through, withdrawals &amp; deposits disabled, site not accessible, site so slow that every click takes &gt; 10 seconds...
