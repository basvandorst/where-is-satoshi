If I remember correctly, you don't have to perform a backup during initial Mycelium install...it just prompts that you havent backed up...

Yeah, exactly...people want to have buying power but they don't want to go into debt.  Saying they *want* deferred payments in conflating the two.

Been happening to me too.
What does mean search?

No word?  Thanks for asking them.

Doesn't erase the value of this.  In places like Argentina, where there is enormous inflation, and Cyprus, where the government takes its people's money, the average human IS interested in controlling their own money.  Bitcoin becomes easier by the day for the layman to use.


First of all, there are other ways to get Bitcoin: friends, mine it, accept it as payment, etc.  Nonetheless, however you derive your money, that is a sunk cost, and has nothign to do with the cost of transferring it.  And the fee to send is optional, to incentivize miners to include your transaction sooner.  So I can send $1,000,000 for 10 cents if I want.  That is close enough to the definition of free to call it free.  I'm not lying to anyone bud.  


This is where I knew you're either an ignorant fool or brand new to Bitcoin.  Yes, it's volatile.  Because it's NEW!  Jesus Christ, how the hell do you think it should behave at this point?

I had this exact same problem with avast.  After reading about it here, I restored the quarantined files, reasonably  thinking that that would fix the problem but now when I try to start bitcoin-qt, I get this error:  "Incorrect or no genesis block found.  Wrong datadir for network?"
Anybody know a solution????

Most of us crypto-revolutionaries have no problem paying reasonable taxes.  Troll on.

@_date: 2014-04-07 07:15:56
Because you truly own your money.  You are your own bank.  You also are the medium of exchange, the protocol.  So you can send money to anyone, anywhere in the world for free.  Your money cannot be inflated away by a central bank printing money at will.  Your money cannot be confiscated at will either (Cyprus).  It removes geopolitical borders and puts money in control of the people!  In a time, where we hold less and less power, this is fundamentally important.  Icing on the cake is the speculative value and mining profits.  But please don't do as many do and confuse these as the true value.  The things I said first are the true value.  Moreover, Bitcoin is basically just a distributed ledger.  Bitcoin currency is the obvious application, but there are many things that are being built on top of the protocol which add value for the future: think: smart contracts, voting, decentralized stock and ownership exchange, etc.  It's a truly revolutionary thing where many amazing technologies coalesced.

Hey thanks!

Can't speak to their overall security, but FYI for everyone, there is a setting to require a secondary (vault) password AND two-factor IN ADDITION to this 4-digit PIN for login.  That's 3FA, actually better than most login requirements, but like I said, I'm just talking about login, not their overall security.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:27:36
Maybe this is what Satoshi's stash is earmarked for!

I missed that comment but looks like the person edited it out.  There is no president of Bitcoin, don't worry.  It's an inside joke about some dumb reporting.  There are a group of core developers but there is no central figure.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:40:53
If he really believes in Bitcoin, he should take a risk and associate it with Wikipedia.  Total win win
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:19:50
In addition to the 4-digit PIN, you can use 2FA AND long vault password.  Look into things more thoroughly before spreading FUD

Those are active or semi active users.  Guess what? When Bitcoin is regularly appearing in large pieces in the WSJ it is turning on a much larger audience than you suggest.

I thought Mycelium uses HD

Thanks buddy! Came here to suggest Erowid, but you astutely have already included it!
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:47:41
Well thank you for the outlier comment that will form the extreme end of opinions that most people would consider to be the wrong/sonsensical end of the spectrum!  
What other NASCENT phenomenon has SO MUCH cultural significance?  I think the combination of those who do know about Bitcoin and are fascinated by it combined with those who are just learning or don't know about Bitcoin make up a larger audience than you think.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:11:11
I feel like ultimately this stands in the way of merchant adoption and fear it could be harmful to the Bitcoin ecosystem.  It reduces demand for native acceptance.  Means more fees for the merchant not less and strengthens MasterCard's grasp. I really don't like that.  People will conflate the two technologies and associate Bitcoin with exorbitant fees.  Fills a hole, but doesn't utilize any of the true value of Bitcoin (as payment system) , i.e, decentralized personal banking.

Why is that self-evident?  That's the same as saying "so that the smallest unit is 10 nBTC".  What's the difference?  Why not .001 micro-bitcoins?

Not sure if you're right here.  First, why would Satoshi have wanted to relate the structure to the dollar?  And if and when Bitcoin takes over the world, the M1 money supply will be a lot more than $20 trillion.  Doesn't add up.
