No exchange I've ever used has let you choose the transfer fee and those ones that I have used typically charge 0.0005 BTC which is way more than is required, even if the mempool is full.

18 year olds still go and fight and die in wars now that are declared by people your age. 
No tertiary education required factory jobs exist anymore and if I could afford a block of land I'd build a house too. 
I wasn't asking for financial advice from internet strangers I was asking how to put a time lock on a Bitcoin. You're the one that instead of answering my question came in here just to be condescending.

You could try 'livingroomofsatoshi' look it up!
@_date: 2019-03-14 07:19:16
Yes but it's very easy for someone to scam you with PayPal.  
If you BUY Bitcoin with PayPal you're fine.  
But if you SELL Bitcoin with PayPal you can easily be scammed.   
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:23:11
Yeah sorry, I'm not sure where you're from so I can't really point you in the right direction. All I can suggest is you find an organisation similar to livingroom for your own country.

No you don't have to have a node to use lightning, just download a lightning wallet like Zap Desktop or Wallet of Satoshi on Android, load some BTC from your normal wallet and you're good to go.

Instead I'd having price goal, have thing goal. 
Sell Bitcoin when it can get you house, car, pay off loans. Whatever. 
Better than just setting arbitrary price target.

You'll have to go through the reset f2a process on each website you used them on.

Yeah *something* in it will break at some point, but the chance of that happening is so slim due to how different the drive train of an electric car is. Have you seen the [Tesla motor after a million miles](
As for affordability, Tesla's aren't exactly cheap to begin with so the people that are taking them in to be fixed can probably expect the price to be a higher than people taking in their 2007 Toyota Camry.  Again I am not really concerned with needing to repair my car because as far as what I could find, the only people repairing their Tesla's are people that have body damage. The cars come with an 8 year warranty (in Australia at least) and so again, besides any body damage (which will not be Tesla's fault) I probably won't be paying to have the car repaired.
As for cutting corners to achieve delivery, Tesla are building more factories around the world and are currently delivery [1000 cars a day](
Anyway dude, if you don't like it, fine don't buy one. But don't sensationalise the costs to repair to support your opinion.

Really? That's strange, what's your node I'll connect to you and then see if you can connect to me?
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:12:09
Well yes that's technically correct however when you install and use these wallets like Zap or Wallet of Satoshi you're connected to their nodes so you *can receive* lighting payments.

If you posted on Reddit about your panic FOMO bulk buy. Don't try day trading, you'll lose everything.

Good thing Tesla's are more reliable and have less moving parts than cars with an internal combustion engine.

Hey Jim! Thanks for your comment :) 
Yes unfourtunetly international shipping is really high which is why we haven't bothered, shipping of that quilt to you in the US would be $37.70 AUD :(
It's actually in stock, someone made a fake order. I've adjusted it back to normal levels if you're still interested in international post hit me up. Otherwise thanks for stopping by :)

 That price is in USD, then when you go to sell the USD for USDT to transfer out it is at such an inflated price the profit you've made from selling your original BTC is gone.  
  
Don't use this exchange, it's so shady.

I could tell from the way he spoke that it wasn't worth it, I've met lots of people like him you just get a eye for them eventually. The tangent he went on shortly was super racist and homophobic so I was right not to bother explaining Bitcoin further from the vibe I got from him initially.
As Satoshi once said: **"If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry"**

No it's not, Communism is stateless and industries are owned by the workers and the profits of their workplace shared amongst them equally.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:49:13
lol okay since you asked: He spoke about a lot of things, Muslims, Gays, Greenies (environmental and socially progressive political party in Australia)  The government in general, Bank Bail-In's and the best one of all was Communism.
So according to old mate that I met:
"Communism is where people get into positions of power and create monopolies for their own personal benefit. Communist don't want free market they want monopolies!"
I said you're mistaking "Communism with capitalism"
and then he said : "Is hat what they told you? Communists can not be trusted, look at what they did to Germany!! Look at Barack Obama told everyone that he was a Christian turns out he is a Communist Muslim from Kenya. Bob Katter and Pauline Hanson of the only honest politicians left that tell it the way it is. School teachers are all dumb and they train our kids to be Communist. They come out of school and they don't know anything! But not like how we had tech schools back in my day, see I came out of school and I didn't know anything either but I still got myself a job, paid in cash and bought my house and I did it all without being a greedy Communist"
Precedes to then tell me that he has four houses that he's trying to sell, but at least he isn't a 'Greedy Communist'

Maybe I will use C-lightning.
I've found that zap desktop doesn't currently work with BTC Pays version of lnd and I have to wait for an update to come from Zap. 
Or I could just use C-lightning now.
