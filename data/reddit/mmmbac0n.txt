Yes, USD to BTC. Any exchange would work. Just what ones have an app other than coinbase

Other than Coinbase, are there any other IOS exchanges?

I’m sorry if this comes off as ignorant, but what are the benefits to running a full node? Just to support the community?

Do you think that the actual implementation of the tech will increase adoption? Or the potential applications of the lightning network?

1. As far as I know, they can be linked if you login to the same wallet. (On most devices)
2. Not necessarily, but they are a little bit less safe because people can get into your phone through your 4 digit passcode, Face ID etc.. It’s a lot safer than Coinbase though. 
Good on you for looking to move away from exchanges. If one of these huge companies is hacked soon, A LOT of people will be hurting.

Remember, 
**COINBASE ONLY INSURES YOUR CASH AND DOES NOT INSURE YOUR CRYPTO** 
If your crypto is hacked there is literally nothing insuring it. You will not get your bitcoin back.

That’s good man. Always remember that Bitcoin is about decentralization. So don’t centralize your bitcoin. 
Good luck!

What exchange do you use that allows limit buys?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:05:33
I plan to use cold storage with my next big purchase, but currently i just use a personal wallet. You should be okay with that, depending on how much money you have. I don’t know much about Trezor though sorry.

Thank you!

Keep your bitcoin in a wallet and not on an exchange. Your keys, your money. Not your keys, not your money. 
I like mine on my phone, so i personally keep some amount on a mobile wallet. Just search the AppStore for those.
If you are purchasing a large amount and want it as safe as you can get it, put it in “cold storage” This means put it on a piece of hardware that you know for a FACT is not contaminated with viruses, and is not connected to the internet. 
Look at something in between, like a physical drive that is designed for bitcoin protection, if you’d like.
Good luck!

I’d love to see proof. I’d stand corrected.

I hold because all of my friends doubted that this would work.
