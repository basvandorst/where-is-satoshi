I'm sure by this point we can safely say Litecoin is not a scam.


and that is true for bitcoin too. Diversification makes you safer!

it is hard to say what is optimal. It depends on block propagation time which in turn depends on the network and the block size and other factors that can change with time.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:20:21
that is not entirely true. The aim is still to pay everybody back everything. The question is just on the timing/order of payouts.

I think you completely misunderstood my original post.
Firstly I was not talking about assets that Bob has left, but profits earned from a community run exchange. It would be like this: If 1$ is available, both get 50c. but if $10 is available, Alice gets 1 and I get 9. (as opposed to Alice gets one millionth of a cent and I get the rest).

yes awful. but a great twist :)

I've been posting and re-posting this on every ghash thread. I don't know why people are not making a bigger deal out of this.
ghash.io have done double spend attacks in the past. They are not honest players.

If we do take over the exchange, **how will bitcoins be paid back?** 
Here is a simplified scenario... I hope you understand the idea.
Let us assume a certain amount of profit has been made in the creditor run exchange.
**Version 1:** The profit is enough, say, to pay back every creditor 1 btc. Every creditor gets paid up to 1 btc, those who were owed less are paid back whatever they were owed and are now out.
**Version 2:** The profit is enough to pay back 5% of all btc owed. Every creditor gets 5% of their debts repaid. 
Personally I like version 1 because 
* the total number of creditors involved falls quickly until only the big-boys are left. (This is a practical consideration)
* For people who had low-btc deposits at MtGox, their losses are likely to reflect a higher portion of their wealth and the loss thus more painful and impact their quality of life much more than people with higher deposits (hundreds or thousands of BTC). Thus paying people back according to version 1 (i.e. weighing every creditor equally) as opposed to version 2 (i.e weighing every bitcoin owed equally) is preferable. (This is a social consideration)

Ha: 
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:19:40
no. I'd say I have a fair amount... not hundreds obviously, but well into double figures.
This is not only about me.

I was probably refering to bitcoiners on reddit and bitcointalk more than bitcoiners in general. I think they fear altcoins because it reminds us of a fundamental contradiction(?) at the heart of the bitcoin debate:
 **there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins but there is no limit on the number of cryptocoins.** 
Thus having a second crypto-coin successfully living alongside bitcoin would mean that the value of the global blockchain-based financial transaction system would be spread around more currency units than just the bitcoins, thus reducing their value. Thus people hoping to become filthy rich off of bitcoin must fight off any and all competition because the fiction 'crypto currency is valuable because the supply is limited to 21m' must be kept alive.

I think you've just touched upon the sore pont in this discussion. Bitcoiners don't want another protocol to succeed because they're worried about bitcoins losing value.
Relatedly. I claim there is great value in *not* using the bitcoin ledger in starting a new coin because the distribution of bitcoin is so extremely inegalitarian. This is political, not technical and we can argue over it; but here it is. I think the bitcoin distribution as it stands now is undesirable and I *hope* that eventually we will have a cryptocurrency ecosystem with a more homogeneous distribution of wealth.
This is early days yet. We have many competing protocols right now from Bitcoin to Litecoin all the way to Primecoin. There is no a-priori reason to chose the one that came first; even if it is currently the biggest. Indeed there are reasons not to choose it but nobody wants to hear about it on this thread, they just want to get rich the way the early adopters did and any mention of alternatives is a threat to be fought with FUD and vitriol. That is @_date: 2014-03-12 16:23:22
Also note, that in **Version 1** there will be an ever increasing number of stories of **people who got fully refunded by the community run exchange**. Surely that has to be good PR.
Further if you look at time-until-fully-reimbursed, in Version 1 everyone will be fully reimbursed sooner than in version 2 (with the exception of the person who is owed the most - this person will be fully reimbursed at the exact same time in both scenarios)

What are the chances of us finding out what actually happened and who knew what when?
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:51:21
What are the chances that the large mtgox bitcoin wallets recently seen moving on the blockchain will become available to creditors? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:03:31
it may be profitable.
withholding blocks to a pool results in a slightly lower payout than mining honestly, but this is only true within one difficulty period. By withholding blocks they are not allowing their hardware to contribute to the difficulty rising resulting in their hardware staying valuable longer.

ghash.io has done double spend attacks in the past. they are a bad player
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:34:52
I think you misunderstand the relationshipp between hash power and security.
If Litecoin and Bitcoin were at the same difficulty right now, Litecoin would be far more secure because it is so much harder to scale scrypt mining to indusctrial scale than to do the same for sha256.
That bitcoins hashrate is a lot higher is a function of bitcoin being more valuable and more widely used, but also because it is so easy (relatively speaking) to develop sha256 asic chips on an industrial scale.
Litecoin is secure because the resources needed to attack the network are prohibitively high. -- same is true for bitcoin.

Here is what I did to back up my codes from a rooted android.
I started a terminal emulator app (alternative adb shell from your pc) and then type
    su
(this will make you root)
    cd /data/user/0/com.google.android.apps.authenticator2/databases
(this puts you in the databases directory of the authenticator app)
    sqlite3 databases
(open database for SQL queries)
    select * from accounts;
(this outputs a bunch of text containing the keys you need.)
good luck.
PS I fount this method here:

Litecoin and bitcoin are very similar. I suspect if one moves strongly with respect to fiat currency, then so will the other. The question is then, what are you hedging against?
They have both survived "in the wild" for years now so we can assume there are no killer bugs in either of them. They both work well -- many here would argue that Litecoin works better/smoother and up to a point they are correct, but bitcoiners will counter that bitcoin is more widespread and is thus easier to use and spend and they have a point too.
The biggest technical difference between them is the mining algorithm and consequently the mining infrastructure surrounding the network. Now we must bear in mind that mining serves two distinct purposes. On the one hand (the ultimate purpose) is to process transactions and protect the ledger against double-spend attempts and on the other hand (the initial purpose) is to distribute coins to the population. Ideally one would one a widely distributed coin with a widely distributed mining infrastructure. I'd make two points here:
* Distribution: Litecoin is more (perhaps only a little more) evenly distributed than bitcoin -- this is due to the longer/later period in which GPU mining was a possibility. Litecoin does not have a mysterious Satoshi holding a motherlode of coins that could **severely** disrupt the network at any time. There is a higher proportion of litecoins yet to be mined than bitcoins and so distribution is more likely to get better -- even though mining is getting more centralised (see next point)
* Mining: 
**(1)** With the advent of ASICs mining has become industrial and more centralised - fewer larger actors fight for ever smaller marginal returns. The effect this has on distribution is not that bad because as margins shrink, miners have to sell more of their mined coins immediately to cover costs, and thus new coins seep onto the marketplace constantly and do not pile up in huge private hoards like they did in the early bitcoin days. Though this does at times depress the price of litecoins, I think that in the long run this is actually a good trend. **(2)** The other effect that ASIC's have is to protect the network from competing coins: what I mean is that a Litecoin ASIC is now and always will be a Litecoin ASIC and will process transactions for as long as possible. GPU miners were always more fickle, jumping from coin to coin as the market price varied. So even if a fancy new coin comes along, it will have to use a different proof-of-work algorithm and the litecoin network is unaffected. **(3)** This leaves us with the question of mining centralisation. This is an issue that plagues bitcoin and litcoin alike and while we have no silver bullet solution, it is an issue that is actively worked on by the community and by the Litecoin Association and the safe hashrate alliance.
And Finally: **Community**
 Many of us have gotten tired of the bitcoin fanboys; the militant anarcho-libertarians; the teenage fanboy advocacy; the endless flame wars. To me Litecoin seems more professional, more serious, more open minded, more welcoming. We'd gladly welcome you to the community should you choose to join us :)

no. he noticed the hack
"the attack was detected in hours but it was only announced today as we investigated and explored our options." - 
that other thing on the 4th was a second hack involving the api key in which users saw some fund leaving their accounts. But the big one happened back in October and he knew about it loooong before he shut down or made a posting.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:43:34
the fraud is: they noticed the hack, they knew they were insolvent and yet they kept up the appearance that everything was fine (fraud!).
They kept accepting new deposits on this website based on false appearance (fraud!). 
They took money deposited after the hack and used to to pay other people (theft!)
The *only* reasonable thing to do after you notice such a huge hack is to shut down immediately!

 40.3 btc!
I tried to move it out of inputs.io 2 days ago, but they had stopped transactions because of a flaw with the API keys. I spent the last two days reading a about security and cold storage.
