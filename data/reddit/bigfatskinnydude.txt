@_date: 2018-10-11 18:31:38
People have stop losses on exchanges to sell at certain prices when falling and the opposite when going up (usually by%, creating price movement) soooo its just a really fast domino effect.. once it goes it goes lol
@_date: 2018-10-03 00:40:22

If hyper inflation happens to the dollar everything goes down.. (some) countries use dollars as a backing to theirs even.. so it will be moon territory just not how everyone thought
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:57:19

That short dip was quick, this one is different.. could face a deathcross between the moving averages.. RSI suggests we bounce back in a few days but ya never know man
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:38:39

@_date: 2018-04-19 01:21:07
Never. Stay in ur bch bubble prick
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:52:59
I have enough to buy a BTC, but i dont think buy an entire one at this price is wise. If you mean middle class = 50k-75k annually. I mean the dollar cost average would be a good bet... I feel the price may stay at or above these prices for a long time too.. this next bull run man who knows how high itll get 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:51:53
r/btc was a cult like subredit against bitcoin, but there name means bitcoin. When I ventured over there I didnt expect that, I didnt know.. the posts after posts of bch this bch that, 'fuck lightning network' 'will never work'. Bch was the lesser of the fork for a reason, yet they hide under bitcoin trying to steal unknowing people from twitter, reddit, and i guess now from bitcoin.com.. idk man something is fucky with those guys
