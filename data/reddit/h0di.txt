Shoulda mentioned silk road cause that's been in the mainstream news, and also satoshi nakamoto
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:04:00
Check ya numbers there champ.
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:09:06
Another next big thing that won't happen from the contract welch
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:13:52
But I like changetip
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:53:30
I did not realize girls use bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-28 02:16:24
Because you've been to both? St Petersburg US is actually both a fun and beautiful city
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:15:52
I know its confusing me too
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:40:46
I read this and feel like I am neo in the matrix and you are morpheus
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:14:59
Gift the paper wallets in some alpaca socks with some jerky in there and they will see the value of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:32:23
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:16:27
Your calculator is boss
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:29:29
It sounds like you are having delusions of grandeur. That's a symptom of mental illness actually. People love bitcoin deeply and that's probably why others hate it/us.
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:35:54
I could see this if you each wore VR headset for Skype call so you can hand the bitcoins over in physical matters
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:10:08
Based on your username try local bitcoins maybe
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:26:46
Throw a few coins in weeklyponzi or superponzi and you should get that money back
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:13:02
You need to wach a lot of videos
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:55:35
Link is scrubbed but I'll check it out thanks
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:05:55
One word: buttcointrolls
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:15:10
Everybody buy paycoin quick pump is coming
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:26:52
The name ponzi is synonymous with scam but it shouldn't be. Ponzi that is not a scam is no different than dice or bitbet unless the ponzi breaks its own rules. I don't need provably fair just consistent
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:21:32
Price does not always go down, shorts get squeezed all the time. Shorting is not killing bitcoin it's just diverting value, albeit diminishing overall. Not enough capital to snap up supply is driving price down
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:24:55
Not scams, just don't bottom for all the other participants on top of you and you'll be ok, I've made btc
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:48:16
Then the next block gets mined
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:13:46
Hashtalk and bct now down, this is some epic shit going on right here
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:15:32
Moving his domain wouldn't give access to his Twitter though
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:00:50
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:25:18
Bitcoinland wants drama and conspiracy and it will be so
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:30:33
The down trend works in our favor in that sense. At some point coins get so cheap it will attract new money. Nevermind there are transfers to exchanges pending that will bring new fiat in the next day or two. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:06:59
FUD this has nothing to do with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:29:55
But I hate fb and the feeling is mutual
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:48:04
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:51:12
I sent a Half dozen emails from various addresses of mine. Will now changetip via twitter
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:59:46
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:02:09
You'd take it from a dog licking peanut butter off your sack don't lie
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:08:22
Thousands in fiat, gonna use a ponzi service to play with my few remaining btc
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:22:36
Problem is a lot of people are thinking but few have the guts to actually buy
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:20:42
Congrats nice one
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:08:00
I sold at 315. Bitcoin is a lead weight in the Caspian sea right now.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:09:35
How else would he host his darknet marketplace?
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:26:37
Your rationale is cringeworthy and suggests you have never had a girlfriend.  Surprisingly pushing old world stereotypes from a bitcoiner
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:19:37
You are a paranoid one now aren't you? Labeling a bunch of things you don't agree with as trolling shows you are a coward and can't defend your points on merit . You are everything that's wrong with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:19:09
Fidora bank? Sign me up, now just need a place for my Trilbys
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:57:56

I would like one sex please. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:48:38

Dat dude loves him some shekels
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:28:24
Pfft, slick duds for your round ball tournament shall never separate me from my hoodie and Jean shorts
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:46:33
Your a moron and a paid shill for the competition coinbase has been nothing but great for me.  Fuck off.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:12:55
Game changer OH YEAH!
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:48:42
But I am a bitcoiner and I'm going to tell them about it anyway
@_date: 2015-02-27 01:50:14
How about dank ones
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:20:58
Sounds racist
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:23:26
You sound like a pissy wejbag
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:03:21
Then after you are high, buy yer porn with Wankcoin
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:47:51

@_date: 2015-02-26 23:16:45
Old news brah
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:45:15
Title of article is not bad but great
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:13:13

@_date: 2015-02-06 20:46:40
Glorious odious ode so pro Nakamoto
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:13:43
Replenishing their stolen btc? Sounds like a reacharound to me
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:38:16
Hold on folks, this is huge
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:46:42
Pie gets smaller for miners so it had better go up in price
