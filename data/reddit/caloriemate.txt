those two addresses (1Enjoy and 1Sochi) have been sending out dust transactions to a bunch of users for a few days now. I don't think they ever get confirmed, though.

hey , do I need a coinkite debit card to pay, or can I pay with a phone app, for example?

Unless you can keep track of each coin (or set of coins) being bought and sold by moving them between wallets and using the blockchain as proof, I don't think you can (or should) use LIFO. 
re: securities, I believe your gains are realized when you sell your security for BTC, yes.

Wow, such graph

It follows the same model as debit/credit card transactions with a handheld terminal which many merchants use. Having that tight of an integration with all the different types of PoS systems seems unrealistic IMO.

that's unfortunate - I don't think it's recoverable, then.

Did TD give you any reason why your account is locked?
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:32:51
source? genuinely curious

Ouch, sounds like you got caught in their automatic fraud detection. I'll probably get sorted out, but it sure sounds painful.
Have you had successful e-transfers before? Or was this the first?
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:09:51
I'm quite surprised that you haven't reached any resolution yet, despite your numerous attempts on the phone and in person - TD is usually a lot better with customer service.

virtex will take you 2-3 weeks to get verified since they're swamped right now.
try vaultofsatoshi.com - you can get verified there quite quickly, but their prices are higher than virtex, and currently only deal in USD.

low-resource use -&gt; probably Electrum so that you don't need to download the entire blockchain.
