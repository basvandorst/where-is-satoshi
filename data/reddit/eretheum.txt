Bear Arms are a basic human right, or left depending which you prefer.

I disagree.

Cool story.

Look at the fee models.

They extorted an entity, that entity was the silk road not Ross Ulbricht.  Have you even read the transcripts?

Smaller block sizes forces layers be built on top of the protocol and 21 exists because of layers.  They appear to be trying to fill a consumer gap.  I would argue their stance on protocol changes is "proceed with caution".  Their stance could be either way, they can *be the good guy* if the block size stays small or they can *be the facilitator* if it grows.  Their relevance comes down to what they have to offer and that will determine their affect on bitcoin.

I recently read an article not sure where that outlined like 5 murders presented at the trial that led to his conviction.  How is that not proof?  And it was at trial, why didn't the defense argue their innocence?  It was pretty convincing to me.

He's right.  Government should stay out of religion but religious groups should have every right to try and represent themselves in any level of government.
  
Think of religion like guns.  The distance between both sides is huge, but both fall under rights granted to us in the constitution.  Right to bare arms, rights to freedom of voice and expression and so on.  He is right that people of similar beliefs should have the right to congregate together.

I don't think your ground is as high as mine.

Didn't this guy also try to whack people?

"Showing up" represents participation.  Bitcoin represents the future of money.  You can shape the future of money by participating.

Thanks for the dictionary response.  In practice the silk road was a business on the internet that had a hierarchy of privilege in its management structure and unprecedented flexibility through anonymity.  There is no excuse for the path Ulbricht took.  He had an unprecedented opportunity to be different.

There is plenty of time to try and convict him for murder for hire.  In fact it is easier now that his identity as DPR has been established by conviction resulting from a jury of peers.
  
They had to establish that he is DPR before they could argue he conspired to commit murder.  The argument "they didn't try him for it so he didn't do it" is not a very good argument against.  Especially in the face of everything we now know.

Acting to kill someone before they can do damage is pro-active and not self defense. 
  


  
There was no gun pointed at Ulbricht's head.  Ulbricht had every advantage in the cases we have seen.  He knew enough about peoples identity to put out murder hits on them but they did not know his.

It is not clear that anyone was in a position to harm Ross or know who he was.  Even the corrupt agents were still trying to lure him out into the open so they could arrest him.

Wow, just wow, since when is extortion the same as murder?  It is extremely unsettling when people in society believe that information is a weapon, because that is exactly what the governments of the world want you to believe so that you will have no problem with them trying to control it.
  
Ross Ulbricht was not being physically threatened, the people doing the threatening didn't even know his identity.  Ross left the high road when he issued hits for murder, regardless of whether those murders actually took place.

I hope he stays gone.

No impact.

That's a very narrow view of bitcoins utility and there is no guarantees that citi won't slowly ramp up fees.
