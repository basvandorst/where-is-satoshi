Yup... I've got the family wanting to borrow money. I have made a ton of money in crypto... but never once cashed out, so the money I did lend was earned from my six figure slave job... retiring in 2018... and not lending money to anybody since both loans were not paid back.

Bitcoin could easily allow more digits, yes? Well... i guess a Satoshi is 0.00000001, so that doesn’t ever change, but there could be further division if needed. Fractions of Satoshis.

Abolish all large governments. Decentralize to small geographic areas, use technology to replace many government functions. 
20% of all humans are governed by the psychopaths in China. USA gov rules over 360m. This is unacceptable and fucking stupid. Tired of dumb statists that prop this shit up. Dopes don’t grasp we already have no fly lists in America with no transparency, no due process.... but we’re free!!!! Ugh.
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:06:20
Hmmm... uneducated. Ok, I’ll make you look like the dolt you obviously are. Now that we have the ad hominem attacks  out of the way, here is the substance.
Birth certificates, real estate titles, vehicle registrations... just a few examples that can be done on a distributed ledger. All of these are currently done by government agencies.
Governments also issue currencies. Are you having trouble imaging a technology that can replace the old system? You’ve heard of crypto currency? Lol
Patent/copyrights. These can be vetted by the private sector and then stored on a blockchain.
Any entity such as a corporation can be defined and stores on a blockchain.
News reports have said that in the next ten to fifteen years, many adminstrative government jobs will be replaced by robots. So that is a step toward minimizing the size of current bloated bureaucracies.  
Election boards could largely be replaced and made more fair with blockchain tech.
The goal should be to decentralize governance. Take a clue from the Preamble in the DOI... abolish the federal government. With an educated populace (I will make an exclusion for you), we could easily have agreements between the states that agree to freedom to travel, trade, and choose residency in any state at any time with no permission required from any state authority. This would give us a superior form of democracy as it would give each person the option to opt out of a government by simply moving to a state that is more to your liking.... and nobody has to get all pissy about it like most dumb Americans do today. As it is now, we are under the thumb of the federal  government and the only option is to renounce, and even that is a difficult and expensive proposition.
So yea... fuck the federal government and fuck all the dumb, non-thinking  statists that don’t grasp what real liberty is.
If you care to reply, please do so with some substance. Tell me why none of this is possible. Tell me exactly why we need a federal government.... i can shoot down any argument, especially the defense argument, which is supposed to be one of the primary functions.

Ha.... i wasn’t going to say anything, but yea... it is possible that newer tech could improve upon what Bitcoin started. Despite Bitcoin’s massive network, the tps is not there, and when the traffic surges you can wind up in mempool hell for a few days if you don’t set your fee right. It’s all peachy when there isn’t much traffic. 
Nano is not yet proven secure yet.... needs time. Devs are pretty solid though, see what they have this year.

I can't speak for BAT, though I can say that Bitcoin is too slow as a currency in certain situations where you want an near instant confirmation. Imagine if you wanted to pay five cents to read an article... the page would give a dialog asking for payment, you would click ok and get a cookie once your payment is confirmed. With Bitcoin, that first confirm takes 10 minutes, and the fee is too high for small payments.

Humans need to regulate the size and scope of all governance. In the US, we need to decentralize. This starts by abolishing the federal government and having a peaceful agreement between the states. This agreement is a cultural tradition and would easily be accepted and respected. It is this; free travel, free trade, freedom to choose residency in any state at any time with no permission required from the state. In this scenario we would have a true choice in governance and create efficiencies as free markets tend to do.

There will be faster tech with as good or better security than Bitcoin. BCH was just 51% attacked (white hat, but nonetheless attacked), and it is essentially the same as Bitcoin in terms of technology. So, you could probably attack a coin like Nano with some something like a spam attack, but in general... Nano is way faster and feeless. And better tech will come along.
Remember all the fallen tech giants... the new crypto stands on the shoulders of Bitcoin.
At this point in time, Bitcoin is clearly the king in almost all ways... except speed and efficiency.

Help me out here. You have some Bitcoin, you see the price pump from $7k to $7.5k. You think it will pull back, so you move to USDT to try and buy back when the price dumps. But the price never dumps... you get left behind. What is your next move? Do you cash out to USD and call it a day, buy back less BTC than you had, or do you start shopping for alt coins in hopes of regaining your Satoshis?
