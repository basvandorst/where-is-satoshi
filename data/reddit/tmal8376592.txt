Huh?  What's 2x bailing out?


Is Bitcoin insecure at the moment?  If so, what do we need to do?  If not, when will it become insecure?


Why not?  Hard drives are very cheap compared to transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:11:54


Is there something in the TOS that would make them liable?  I can't find anything


Was that the reason?  Where did you see this?  It seemed to be solely because BCC had a lot more following and strength than most people (including myself) expected
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:47:44
Hmm, I did some looking earlier and found some useful info here: 
But I'm no expert.  I kind of had to approximate the volume weights a bit because no source provided it cleanly
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:05:29


Hmm, that's odd, where did this image come from then?  


Wasn't [that on Bitcoinocracy.com]( before bitcoin.com bought them?


Are there better measures out there that I'm missing?


Is there evidence of millions opposed to 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:31:00


Hmm but I thought node counts were how we counted the consensus against 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:54:09
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:15:36


Hmm, I usually think of competition as a good thing though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:16:14


When is that expected to happen and actually provide a benefit?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:40:48




Why couldn't we avoid this entirely with SPV trustlessly identifying the longest chain, and then trustlessly downloading the UTXO state via a UTXO commitment on that chain?


The alternative seems to be not allowing them to use it at all though?


At what point would this become bad?  If we were willing to pay 0.00x BTC per month for a node, how far could we scale?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:59:12


Oh... but doesn't segwit2x have Andresen, Garzik, Hoffman, and the developers at Bitpay, blockchain.info, Coinbase, Bitfury, etc?
I haven't seen very many issues so far but haven't been looking closely
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:28:25


So wait, if I sent a transaction to Coinbase from my full core node, what would happen?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:25:32
Are you saying Core is ok with losing &gt;50% of the merchant adoption that we worked so hard to build for the last 7 years?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:05:35


Wasn't BIP148 just 12% of the nodes at the time of 2x though?  And 0.3% of the hashrate?  I think Andreas Antonopoulos talked about this, like a blockade in the pacific ocean?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:11:47


Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:47:27
[Here]( is one place.  What is the question though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:17:10


Hm, wouldn't they represent a larger share of the economy though, thus supporting the economic majority idea?
And why are things without even a working website or active company like yogh, multibit, and bitcoinembassy on there?  I don't see things like that among the support column?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:16:43
Wait, isn't Mike Belshe a segwit2x supporter?
Damn these guys, they've infected everything good!
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:40:18
That's quite a lot of commits though, and goes right up until they released?
How do we measure code quality?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:14:04


Hmm, doesn't that seem bad though?  I don't know how many people will stick with us for 4 months with the chain being low-volume...


Hmm ok... But I only see slush there?  And one block, 480917, that isn't marked with a pool?
Hasn't someone split off from the agreement in our favor by now?


Hmm, ok, I'll take that then.  But it says only 265 answers?  That seems really low... And isn't Coinbase a 2x supporter?


Ah, good point.  But when did the 2x code get released?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:36:17
But what will Coinbase be using?  Did they say something about it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:23:55


Hmm, but in the example given by Maxwell, a non-signaling miner would have had to be larger than any signaling miner, and every miner &gt; 5% was signaling? And where did the bug come from in the first place if not Core's BIP91/BIP148?  What did I miss there?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:08:33


Isn't BTC1 segwit compatible?


If they were to link to Bitcoin Core, that seems even more likely - They could be rejecting the majority economic and miner consensus and be stuck on the lower value chain.  Is that incorrect?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:24:27
Right!  I run a node.  But won't BTC1 run nodes too?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:28:14


When was it proposed though?
And how much support did UASF have prior to March 7th, 2017?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:30:09
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:22:48


Yes?  What's negligent about recommending software that's compatible with both Bitpay and segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:33:47
Wait, they're creating a new altcoin that isn't segwit2x?  Did I miss something?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:50:10
If a company were on that list but didn't support it, wouldn't they say so?
And [doesn't this count]( from the CEO of coinbase?
Edit: Wrong link
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:29:12
Whoops, wrong link.  This one has it:




@_date: 2017-08-17 20:24:24


Hmm, but BCC doesn't have much transaction volume or real use, and even the miners supporting big blocks aren't mining for it yet, right?  And there's still 93% of miners signaling /NYA/ and updates on btc1?


It doesn't seem like the divorce has actually happened though... Is it not more like the angry teenager left for the afternoon?


I've seen several polls stating the opposite... Did I read something wrong? Where did you see this?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:16:56


How do bigger blocks do these things?  Fullnodes can use SPV+UTXO commitments trustlessly and miners spend nearly all their money on mining devices and facilities that aren't affected by blocksize?


Why wouldn't higher fees centralize the system?


But transaction fees are an even more essential part of using the financial system than full nodes, so wouldn't that drive the total cost of usage even higher and centralize it?


What does that have to do with bigger blocks?


How not?  A transaction can be settled for 150 bytes of data.  PayPal's login page alone is over 100kb of data that's an essential part of using that system?  Blockchains settle in 1 hour, wire transfers/CC's take 5-14 days to settle?


That's the only advantage?  What about being international?  Deflationary?  Pseudonymous?  Un-freezable?


But how far could we scale for $x cost per month?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:31:56
Hm, but Lightning appears to also be limited in that large transactions can't find a route to fit on it, and so have to go on-chain, right?  What happens in situations like where a retailer collects lots of small payments in lightning to pay a vendor on-chain, but that money isn't flowing back to the consumers' channels in lightning?  Wouldn't the consumers just have to close and reopen their lightning channels to refill them every month?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:20:05


How are they forcing anyone to do anything there?


Is there evidence that segwit2x doesn't have broad consensus?  I'd like to have correct information if I've been mislead
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:39:05


What happens when the nodes disagree?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:15:21


Has someone privately withdrawn?  How do we know?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:24:57


But won't the btc1 nodes and users accept those?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:41:30


Yeah?  I have questions, this whole thing is really confusing.  Is it bad to ask questions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:56:45


Right, but it looks like more than a simple majority of exchanges support it(by volume) plus 90% or so of the merchants that accept bitcoin through Bitpay and Coinbase...?  And companies with a lot of volume like Circle, Genesis Trading, Xapo, BitPesa/BitWala, right?
Is there some evidence that I haven't seen linked that 2x does not have the economic majority?


Whoa, Is someone talking about trying to do this?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:15:51
Don't politicians generally waffle depending on which subgroup they're talking to?  Could we find evidence of them flip-flopping like politicians do?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:29:44


Isn't that what btc1 is then?  So you agree it should happen as described by its supporters?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:31:48


How is it misleading?  The Core client won't be compatible with Bitpay's own services in 3 months.  They couldn't possibly recommend anything else
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:27:44
Well I found [this here]( The news company got it wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:53:19


Oh, that's something.  What's the attack vector?  Is there some game theory that explains the risks and how we know we're vulnerable?


btc1 has the same or lower quadratic hashing as Core though?  They limited tx size.


It seems like there has been disagreement about that from the beginning?  Even going back to the creator?


Ok, but if we can't accommodate coffee, what can we accommodate?  Where's the line drawn, and why?  What are the tradeoffs?


Ok, but gold seems to be very different from Bitcoin.  Does gold have competitors, or did it?  What's the history that provides each with their value?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:16:53
Ok, I'll check there.  Thanks for your answers!
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:59:44


It seems [like they were]( but refused to come?


Are there big-name / recognizable businesses that explicitly intend to reject the hardfork that I'm not aware of?  Who is against it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:12:10


Ok, Coinbase seems much the same, right?
So excluding Bitpay and Coinbase customers... What merchants do we have that accept Bitcoin today?


Right, but that's a list of companies who haven't taken a position on the issue, and it includes everything of any size.  What big one rejects 2x?


Isn't [Bobby Lee]( from BTCC?
And [these guys]( seem to be using it?
And Bitfury's Valery Vavilov who said "[We are also in the working group that is researching, building, reviewing and testing the upgrade](
Thanks for answering my questions, sorry for so many
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:44:41
Ah, I see. Thanks for the answers!
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:01:07
Only thing he didn't mention there is that the block at blockheight 494,784 must be &gt; 1mb.
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:32:25


Why not?  If people were willing to spend say 0.000x BTC per month on running a full node, how far could we scale?


Why?  And how do we know if we're centralized and vulnerable?


Really??  Can you link me to some of these?  I'd like to have the correct information if I've been mistaken


Can't fees also become too expensive for the average user?


How much would that cost per month for fullnodes?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:27:36
Not sure why this has been upvoted... The code is complete and deployed on miners today.  The code was released more than 3 weeks ago.  Many of the miners have confirmed on twitter that they're running segwit2x, in particular the pro-segwit miners BTCC and Bitfury.


The latest pull request from garzik formalizes the exact rule changes, and that was done before.  But regardless, the code is already done, so there's no need for "formalized discussions" or BIP's at this point.
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:29:10
Do the hodlers oppose 2x?  Wasn't there a website where people could vote with coin signatures so we could check?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:13:35


Was there some way Core was measuring the support to justify BIP8/BIP149?  Or anything that makes that seem like less of a coercive plan?
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:08:14
Where did you see evidence of that?  From everything I can find 2x has very wide support across the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:38:00


Then the Devs should have compromised like they said they were going to, long ago.  They didn't, so here we are.  They still aren't going to in 3 months, and so we'll have 3 coins for a little while.
Compromises prevent coin splits.  Refusing to compromise creates them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:50:11


Hmm, is there some reason why the minority chain wouldn't be the altcoin?


Why wouldn't the minority chain just add replay protection?  Especially if they are the ones requesting it?  Seems very easy for them to do.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:53:48


Why does that matter?  Shouldn't the minority chain be adding replay protection, or maybe both chains?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:46:12
Asking questions?  I just want clarity, this whole thing is confusing
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:54:12


Where did you read that?  From what I've seen, polls and many other things indicate wide support for segwit2x.  Is my info wrong?  Can you help me correct it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:28:45
I'm not sure what I'm looking at there?  You mean the 2 contributors?  Does that count all contributors or only those with commit access?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:08:48
So after segwit activates, problem will be solved?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:44:10


Yeah... it seems like they really want on-chain scaling.  And that's bad?


What happens if the users choose 2x though?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:00:44
A lot of other people seem to value Bitcoin for a lot of other reasons.  What about them?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:52:17


Could it just be that they didn't have a need to upgrade so soon?  Or do we know that number isn't going to rise?  Who is running those 160 nodes?


Several people have linked me to that list but I'm still confused... It lists Gemini and Vaultoro as non-supporters, but Vaultoro is listed as NYA?  And Gemini seems bound to follow the most PoW chain by their SEC filings...?
And why doesn't the list differentiate between "no comment" and "neutral" and "reject 2x?" Would be clearer if it did I think
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:24:33


No, [by default, it skips all validation to the known checkpoint](  How many people know about / care about / use that setting?  How's that any different from a trustless sync that uses SPV but consumes way less bandwidth?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:32:13


Is there a lawyer somewhere that has stated this to be true?  Wouldn't it be possible for a court to rule in their favor given the "withdraw your coins before Aug 1 if you want BCC" statements prior?


Didn't they actually sign the agreement to support segwit2x though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:41:45
So if the count of btc1 nodes on the network were to rise dramatically by November, what would that mean?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:45:43


So the fees will drop instantly in 7 days when segwit activates then?


Isn't [Bobby Lee BTCC]( or do I have someone else?  And Valery Vavilov from Bitfury who said "[We are also in the working group that is researching, building, reviewing and testing the upgrade](
And [these guys]( seem to be running it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:20:15


Very nearly the same thing was agreed to by 7 Core Devs in Feburary 2016 though?  And Garzik, Andresen, Bitpay, Coinbase, spondoolies... these are hardly nontechnical users?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:07:52


As far as I can tell, this is a result of Core Developers refusing to agree with what is otherwise a reasonable compromise between the two extremes, and has the majority of the businesses, exchanges, and miners on board... AFAIK Core was invited to the meeting, and it is very similar to the prior agreement which 7 prominent Core developers signed... Am I wrong there?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:32:56


Why isn't it best for the ecosystem?  What exactly is bad about it technically?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:17:57


Wait, why would they need to do that?


Huh?  Why wouldn't it be the chain that has both the economic majority and the most PoW?


Why wouldn't that logic apply to trying to call no2x "Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:23:13
You're fine.  Bitpay offers a wallet now?  I didn't know that
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:15:01


Isn't BTCC like the largest remaining pool that supported segwit though?  They're in China I think


What's he done?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:53:17


Where did you read that the exchanges don't support segwit2x?  From what I've found segwit2x has over 52% of support, and no2x has less than 1%?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:27:11


You feel like a compromise in a consensus system ridiculous?  Seems like it could actually hold the community together?


Wait, I'm confused.  BCC has something to do with segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:06:59
How old?  I have some S3's, but they seem pretty worthless compared to modern tech...
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:06:13


??? Really??  Can you link me to something about that?  I thought BIP141 was Bit 1 signaling?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:11:03


What was the bit4 signaling though?


How much do you mean by this?


Wouldn't the chain with both the economic majority and the most PoW be Bitcoin?  Why or why not?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:05:13


Hmm, that's true, but isn't it equally true that most users will follow the more usable chain?  If not, why not?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:52:25
Essentially it is the economic majority that has been brought up here for many months.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:46:56
So just to be clear, when segwit2x breaks consensus with an overwhelming majority and becomes the longest chain, the legacy chain will become an altcoin in your mind?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:56:47
And what if 94.3% of miners switch?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:45:38


How long until that can provide some relief for the average user?  And are there tradeoffs associated with those offchain transactions?


Hmm, wasn't segwit2mb proposed on March 7th and posted to bitcoin-dev on March 31?  Silbert's first tweet doesn't seem to be until 1.5 months after that?


Hmm, but why aren't the big block miners mining for BCH?  Do we know for sure that the supporters of 2x actually split off?  Before BCH did the bugfixers support 2x at all?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:42:10


What's the experience of the other teams then?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:26:02
Coinbase is an alternative
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:31:11


It seems like the community split, or was on the verge of a split, already, no?  Several companies said without segwit2x that they would back BCC, which I don't think anyone really wants...


Err, aren't compromises in a consensus system a good thing for consensus?


Seems like it would double the number of users that can adopt Bitcoin and give us breathing room for Lightning to build its network effects?  Or is that wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:25:43


Ah, I see it now.  Is it changing?  Who has said they will not follow the agreement and mine no2x for us?


How long would that be?  Isn't it every 2 weeks?  Or is it based on block count?


Oh, they're discussing that?  That'd be solid!  Where's the discussions on how that would go for us?


Wouldn't it have the exact same UTXO as the original chain?  What makes it a new coin and the old chain not an altcoin?  Who decides what is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:03:56






Ok, wait, if it isn't merchants, exchanges, or coin ownership, how could we possibly measure it?  What is it you mean by the economic majority then??


Garzik, Andresen, Ian Grigg, and Joseph Vaughn Perling are Bitcoin developers though?  And how does being a developer relate to the economic majority?


Wasn't BIP91 created in response to segwit2x as an effort towards compatibility?  So wouldn't that be the miners implementing segwit2x?


Why should the majority chain with what appears to be an economic majority rebrand or include replay protection?  Isn't that more appropriate for the minority?  Why or why not?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:31:01
Wouldn't people just attack them for how they wrote that post if they did that?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:37:11


The post was about upgrading for segwit.  If someone's already upgraded for segwit, would the post still be an issue?


But the one they linked is compatible with BitPay, and Core is not?  Why would they pick one that isn't compatible with their company/services in 3 months?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:05:50


Whoa, really?  Who has withdrawn?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:49:26


Right, but isn't segwit2x just basically segwit2mb which was proposed and signed over 18 months ago?


It seems like the cart moved no?  btc1 code is done and released, and signaled bit4 to activate segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:33:21


Oh?  What was the difference between segwit2mb proposed March 7th 2017 and segwit2x under Barry Silbert's agreement?


Ok... looking [here]( I see Hilliard, Todd, jacob-eliosoff, lichtamberg, Saicere, btcdrak, jlopp, greenaddress, 
and earonesty pushing for BIP91 compatibility.  Those are all either core developers or core supporters.  That makes it seem like the people who wanted segwit2x to be compatible were core/BIP148 people, not NYA signers... right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:37:03
Ah, ok. Thanks for the clarification and answers!
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:27:15
Ok. I propose measuring hashrate support based on what miners say they will do, and I propose measuring economic support based on exchange &amp; business Bitcoin volume, and on the votes of coins held in active addresses.
Any issues with that?  If so, what are the alternatives?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:27:18


Hmm, I'm not sure what meeting he's referring to there that was secret?  Segwit2mb was proposed on the 7th of March I think, and posted to bitcoin-core on the 31st of March.  Silbert didn't mention it until the 17th of may, 45 days later, and had people publicly responding with support, and the actual "meeting" took place on the 21st before the Consensus 2017 conference.  What meeting is Greg referring to that was secret or what proposal that didn't involve public input?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:08:16
Wait, Segwit isn't a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:11:46
Well, I'm no expert, but this shows that [every Chinese exchange]( is signed on - OKcoin(11%), BTCC(10%), Huobi(3%), BTER(1%), plus Coinbase (12%), Bitflyer(8%), shapeshift(1%), Bitex.la, ViaBTC, Bitso, OpenBazaar, and Vaultoro are signed on, so that's &gt;46% right there. Gemini(7%) must follow the most PoW chain per SEC filings, so that's 52% if 2x has more PoW.  OTC markets like Genesis Trading are signed on, and the biggest merchant payment providers are signed on(Bitpay, Coinbase), plus other economic drivers like Circle, BitPesa, BitWala, and Purse.io are all signed on.
I had to approximate volumes as there's no single site that has all of those listed, but [this was the clearest source]( followed by [this]( as the most comprehensive.  Is the information I found wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:29:49


Are there any that have said they won't follow through?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:10:26


No?  BCC was a rejection of segwit entirely and a distrust of 2x...


The big-block supporters would never have accepted segwit-only without 2x.  That was the compromise.  If 2x doesn't happen, they will leave to make BCC that much stronger.


How is the risk not originating from Core rejecting the compromise though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:00:27


I don't know for sure.  I counted something like 70 commits or so?  A lot more different names but I didn't get a count unless I did it by hand
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:44:22


This is true, and a good point.  Are there better ways we can measure this?


Curious, what are you referring to here?


Website says it is dead and no longer updated though?


It lists bitcoinembassy as .ca, and the website is not working?  Are they the same?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:07:32


When you want to buy stuff?


Wait, didn't Bitcoin spend the last several years working for many many hours a week trying to get businesses and merchants to accept Bitcoin across the entire world?


So what?  How long would it take Bitcoin to get to that point at previous growth levels?


Wait, if people are really using Bitcoin, how is that bloat?  That's what we wanted for all the last several years, right?


Still lets twice as many people adopt Bitcoin as can right now, right?  What's the cost of letting twice as many people use Bitcoin?


What's sacrosanct here?


I would say the challenge and beauty of Bitcoin would be making it work for everyone, everywhere, for whatever reasonable uses they have for it.  What's wrong with that goal?


How do more transactions take more energy??
And if the blocks are full and people are taking down Bitcoin donation links, isn't that keeping people from using Bitcoin?  Fees today are over $5 on average again, that seems high enough to keep a lot of potential users from using it...  And when will the transaction fee growth stop?  Could it reach $1000?


Wait, how many people can afford to open a million dollar channel on lightning?


Rai stones seemed to stop scaling around 10,000 people though... We already have far more than that...
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:29:34


How so?  BTC1 is compatible with segwit and locked it in.  If Bitpay were to do anything else, they'd be putting customers on a fork that isn't going to be compatible with their service in 3 months... right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:58:30


Hmm, but if 2x has the majority of the economy and miners, wouldn't 2x be Bitcoin then?  How would no2x be Bitcoin but 2x not?  What's the argument I'm missing?
Also, post-fork core wouldn't be compatible with Bitpay.  Why would Bitpay recommend something that won't be compatible with them??
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:54:54




FYI, this isn't true if the hub performs a huge default-en-masse attack and the victims can't get their transactions into blocks on time.  It also isn't true if a wealthy user does the same attack against the hubs.
And it also isn't true if a user goes offline in the middle of an unrelated transfer chain and isn't paying for someone else to watch the chain and close the channel on behalf of innocent offline user.  So there's at least 2 distinct ways where lightning puts a user's funds in jeopardy.
That, the opening/closing/refilling requirements, the routing problems with larger transactions, and the always-online requirements are going to seriously hurt lightning's adoption. Low adoption -&gt; no network effect -&gt; users go to altcoins for usability. :(

Hmm, I've seen upvotes and downvotes both for and against it.  Is there a better way to differentiate what % of the sub's users are for/against something?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:59:43


So merchants, right?  But don't like 90% of our merchants go through either Bitpay or Coinbase?


But listing certain names are removed and others are not... Why?  How are they deciding what is allowed and not?


Ok great, how do we measure the opposition?  Are there polls or something?


Really?  I've seen the list but I didn't see any major players who have explicitly stated they won't use segwit2x... What are the major players who reject it?


They seem to be stating they are running it though?  Are they lying?  Why would they lie about it?


But if they're on the wrong fork in the long term, the entire voice opposing runaway big blocks would vanish from Bitcoin...  That seems bad even for moderates?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:18:16


Oh, my bad... Where's the BIP for that?  And what's the timeline?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:29:58
I guess, how do we know that btc1 represents the potential loss of funds, but Core does not?  Is there something that's telling us the position of the economic majority?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:20:28


Hmm, what happens if the economic majority forks and we sell the coins on the winning fork though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:41:08


Right, but the checkpoint time buffer would solve that, right?  Wouldn't that be trustless?


A re-org is of little consequence?  Why are people so worried about 51% attacks then?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:33:39


If they don't follow the fork, they can't use Bitpay.  Using this logic, shouldn't the btc1 client already be on bitcoin.org with an explanation of what's happening?  Bitcoin.org seems to have more of a responsibility to the public than Bitpay??


Who are you saying gets to decide that though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:03:00
Hmm, is that list out of date or something?
And it doesn't seem like those are companies that do not support segwit2x, most of those seem neutral on the issue?  Are there large companies that will follow no2x?
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:54:16
If people were willing to spend $30 a month to run a node, how far could Bitcoin scale?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:55:25


How would segwit have activated without segwit2x though?  From what I saw BIP148 had less than 12% of nodes, 0.3% of miners, and didn't even have Core's support?  What did I miss there?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:42:50
Hmm, what big name supporters should I be looking for there?  I see some big names that don't seem to have stated either way on segwit2x, and some smaller companies that don't want it... Which are you meaning?
Also, is this list out of date or something? Vaultoro is listed as unopposed but they've signed the NYA. And Gemini is listed, but their SEC filings require them to follow the fork that has the most PoW. They list OKCoin and Huobi as needs clarification, but both of them signed the chinese roundtable supporting segwit2x... ?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:42:19
I don't, but why do they put /NYA/ in their blocks strings?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:37:40


Err, those are all run by businesses...


How would it stop functioning?


Why would they need to be hundreds of dollars though?  What would we gain by having them be so high?


But at hundreds of dollars per transaction, it would still only be usable by a very small proportion of the world's population, or even America's population... Wouldn't it be bad to exclude huge proportions of the world?


Thanks I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:05:38
Hmm, aren't over half of the exchanges by volume signers on segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:15:35


Well in open source when there's a dispute, the project just forks, hence Gentoo/Debian/RHEL/Ubuntu/Mint/Gnome/MATE/KDE/XFCE, etc... Right?
But Bitcoin is a bit different... Its a consensus system relying on agreement, right?  Or no, compromise still not more appropriate then?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:32:39


So it doesn't matter what people say at all?  Just ignore everyone and everything?


Right, but aren't consensus rules formed around maintaining a consensus - keeping everyone in the same system on the same page?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:22:12


How did they not do that?  BTC1 is compatible with segwit.  Post-hardfork, core won't be compatible with Bitpay anymore... right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:46:13


It seems [like they were]( but refused to come?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:47:25


Hmm, but hoarding Bitcoin would require it to have some sort of more intrinsic value.  Like for gold, there's thousands of years of history and even when it was being "adopted" it had few competitors.  Could that idea be wrong as applied to Bitcoin at age 8?


Hm, I could see the technology as being inevitable, you're right there... But would the technology being inevitable necessarily mean Bitcoin would be primary driver of that technology over the next 50 years?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:29:05
What if every exchange chooses to no longer be a Bitcoin exchange though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:32:39


Hmm, why are the numbers so different on that page between "enable weighting" and not?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:06:06
So once Segwit activates, problem solved?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:33:47
Why can't we have both though?  Higher throughput and can't be shut down by the government?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:11:12


Is the BIP process the only way?  In other FOSS projects, a disagreement like this would just fork the project, like Gnome/MATE/KDE/XFCE?
But I did find both the post and the BIP application process from Sergio Demian Lerner.  But they didn't get a BIP number?  Who is in charge of BIP numbers?  For that matter, people mention spoonnet... What BIP is that?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:06:13
I've read it, I don't recall seeing any major bugs or anything that core helped fix except for the peering problem that was kind of a non-issue?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:04:13
What do you propose to measure support?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:09:02


Its a Bitpay site and a Bitpay service... Wouldn't the main issue be about compatibility with Bitpay?


So if 2x has both the economic majority and the most PoW, that's Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:23:00


Really?  How do we know they've been using it?  Did someone do some statistical analysis on the blocks to show they're using it?


Whoa really?  That would show up on blockchain.info which records a first seen time and the block's time, right?  Where's some examples of these?


Hmm...  According to some estimates I've seen, Bitcoin has over 1.5 million users... But we only have 9k nodes?


Right, but then you can't be paid, and you have to close/reopen the channel to keep using it?  Is that better than just doing it on chain?


Did they say that?  Crazy! I didn't know
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:07:39


Doesn't the code activate a hardfork at block 494,784 though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:27:45


Define worked?  Bit4 preceded bit1?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:54:11


!!!  How would that happen, what do you mean??
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:36:06


Hmm, why do you think it is the current path of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:25:36


Good point.  But how fast will the original chain we're on get blocks after segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:52:21


Wait... From what I've seen, segwit was not on track to activate at all until segwit2x was announced...  Did I read the wrong charts/info there? Isn't that what is saying?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:48:32


Whoa, that's two transactions?  How many people can Bitcoin fit on-chain today if everyone had to do 2-3 transactions a month?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:41:43


What are they saying they are going to do?


1/10th as fast means 1/10th the transaction volume, right?  We're already maxxed today, how would losing 90% of transaction processing capabilities be usable?  And how long would this last?


True, good point.  But BTC1 nodes, merchants and exchanges would be validating their blocks and accepting it, right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:49:55
Ok, someone pinged him in one of my replies, maybe he'll respond
Genuinely curious here, just have questions
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:03:34


I'm asking questions because this is all very confusing... That's not ok?


What do you mean like me?  I'm asking how we know these things, they all seem very nebulous and hard to pin down.  There's a lot of people who have studied this a lot, right?  They must have some way of knowing, but what is that?
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:41:09
What did you remember?  Silbert's post was on the 17th of May; Meeting was on the 21st of May.  segwit2mb was proposed 7th of March.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:39:00


Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:51:06
On the other side of the fork, yes, but not on the BTC side.  Segwit isn't activated for another ~9 days, but even that won't provide any immediate relief as people need to begin using it and convert ~50 million utxo's into segwit utxo's.  Segwit2x will fix this issue, but isn't coming until November.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:50:53


Does Bitmain still have any relation to BCC?  Are they mining for it or contributing development time still?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:14:19


Hint: If you aren't paying for it, you're not a customer. You're the product being sold.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:37:56
Segwit didn't lower the fees?  Why are they lower?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:39:53


Hmm, ok, good answer, thanks.  So what are the technical arguments for 2x versus no2x?


Hmm, I haven't found anything indicating 90%... Where did you see this?  I'd like to have good information
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:41:56


Couldn't it just mean "lower total of node costs + transaction fee costs"?  That seems less subjective and much easier to objectively evaluate...


What's the centralization risk of bigger blocks?


So in 7 days, fees will drop back immediately?


When will that be usable by non-technical people though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:20:10


Well if there's a longer chain, couldn't that also be a 51% attack, which full nodes are still vulnerable to?
And if the SPV client gives a good buffer on the UTXO checkpoint, like 6 months, that buffer would give the SPV clients time to upgrade to select between two different forks?  Or no something wrong with that idea?
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:04:22


From what I've read and from some websites I use, Bitcoin donation links are coming down... and the average fee paid both today and for two weeks straight June was over $4...  Seems to be driving away users.  That's not a problem?


So on-chain transaction fees will drop very sharply in 7 days?


Wait, how is the blocksize a cryptographer problem?  It seems to be an economic and game theory problem?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:46:37
Transaction fees for reasonable inclusion are already back above $2.5 today.  Segwit2x is happening.
Price increases will not stay stable; Huge price spikes are always highly unstable and unpredictable.  We will probably see a price crash after it peaks, wherever that peak may be.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:22:26
Good timing!  It looks like Bitcoin Cash nearly doubled in price today
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:48:12


Wait, what?  What are you referring to here?  segwit2mb was first proposed more than 2 months before the silbert meeting, and 4 days before the meeting Silbert's twitter and a post in blew up with support of segwit2mb.  How did the closed door meeting decide anything?
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:26:32


Did people ever find suspicious transactions that back the claim of actual spam taking place?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:01:04




Wait, if they were to recommend installing no2x instead of 2x, couldn't the users find themselves accepting no2x tokens that are worth just 10% of the value?


What measurements have been proposed to do this?  What attempts has Core made at measuring this?
Also, from that some roundtable, where is the release with +2MB that was agreed upon, or its recommendations?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:25:31
Wait, I'm hearing conflicting things.  Segwit activates in about 7 days.  Average transaction fee today was back over $5... Will or won't fix our transaction fee problems be fixed in 7 days?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:59:20


Wasn't the NYA just segwit2mb, which was proposed on March 7th and emailed to the bitcoin-dev email list on March 31?  I thought even Silbert's tweets about it on the 17th of May called it segwit2mb as originally proposed?


Who was it that wanted to make it compatible, though?  Wouldn't that be something we could see on the github  comments from that day, and see which side those individuals are actually on though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:25:24


I'm really not sure, I'd like someone to explain it either way.  So much confusion.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:24:39
Sorry for asking questions
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:44:42
Ok, but what about from when it was forked until today?  How many committers and how many commits on each?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:07:58
Hmm, but BIP148 is dated March 12th, 2017 and the segwit2mb proposal first surfaced March 7th, 2017?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:18:26


Is there some reason Core can't just add replay protection and do this?  Wouldn't that give everyone what they want?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:42:57


Isn't that what they said they were going to do?  What happens if they actually follow through though?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:33:09


Wouldn't be it valid according to segwit2x nodes?  What would happen if I sent a payment to coinbase on the legacy chain?
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:35:28


Well that seems to agree with what I said... they were invited, and they did refuse to come.


I'm not sure how this was unethically conducted, maybe you could explain what nullc means there?  The invite for the meeting was made well in advance and declined publicly; The proposal used was a proposal that Sergio Demian Lerner made on the mailing list before the meeting, and very similar to a proposal that 7 core developers signed in 2016?
Other than nullc simply not agreeing with the compromise, where's the unethical part?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:14:27


It would double the number of people that can use Bitcoin though, right?  Why would that be bad?  Couldn't that double the price?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:08:16
I was referring to the businesses that seem to support segwit2x, not anything about miners.  There seems to be a lot of very big name businesses supporting it, and almost none opposed... no?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:55:47
Hmm, looks like ~34 million people, 12 months, 2.5 transactions a month - 1.02 Billion transactions a year?
So if segwit is 1.7x capacity times 2000 transactions per block, that's... Only 178 Million transactions a year?
That seems not good, even for just lightning... Someone must have a plan for this though?  California isn't even that big
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:28:40


Why not?  Other open source projects fork very frequently when there's a major dispute, they don't just stuff their complaints.  And Bitcoin is even different from that... Its more of a consensus system relying on mutual agreement, no?  Why would compromises not be appropriate for such a system?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:35:13


But to use those things, you have to use the main chain first, right?  And when are those things going to be usable for non-technical people?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:43:19


Ok, but isn't that waaayyyy better than nothing though?  Why would Bitcoin have a high value if it weren't usable?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:57:10


Didn't several members of Core sign an agreement that they would provide a recommendation and a release that included a 2mb hardfork though?  Did they do that somewhere?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:41:52


Oh... So in 7 days the problem will be resolved, at least for quite awhile?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:18:12


@_date: 2017-08-17 21:39:28


The one that seems to have the economic and PoW majority... right?
Wouldn't it be irresponsible for them to not recommend the client that they will be compatible with that is also backed by majorities?


Does that mean that it is the position of the mods that btc1 is malware?

@_date: 2017-08-17 22:30:09


Ok, but doesn't this also imply that they won't be resistant to switching either?


Doesn't it work for the users not following the debate by following the chain that frequently gets blocks?  How fast will the original chain we're on get blocks after 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:38:12
I believe overstock accepts BCC and Ethereum now, and Patrick Byrne has stated he wants to see increased speed and throughput on the bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:11:37


Aren't the majority of merchants (Bitpay and Coinbase) and most of the exchanges and major businesses supporting it too?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:57:50


It seems like a compromise in the debate... What makes it not simply a compromise in the debate?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:48:59


Just making sure I understand, Segwit2x is a centralized cartel?  What's the big goal they're colluding for and who leaked the info about it, did they get killed?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:12:56
Thanks for being honest, clear, and reasonable.  Better than most here. :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:14:41


Doesn't Bitcoin Core do that today?  There's a variable for syncing where transactions aren't checked below a certain hard-coded checkpoint?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:21:10


But transaction fees are still high today, and some websites are avoiding Bitcoin because of it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:19:32


Oh, a softfork can activate with a minority hashrate and force the majority to follow the tighter rules?  How does that work?


Is this hard-coded and can't change?  Or is this something that could change over time?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:31:52


But aren't they a huge part of the economic majority?  Isn't that what UASF was all about when it had 0.3% of miners and ~13% of nodes?
Is there some reason that the average nontechnical Bitcoin user wouldn't follow 2x if the main chain has trouble from lack of miners?


Err, I don't see big name supporters opposed there, just neutral names and a few smaller companies that oppose it... which one are you referring to?
Even among non-supporters, that can't be right... Vaultoro is listed as unopposed but they've signed the NYA.  And Gemini is listed, but their SEC filings require them to follow the fork that has the most PoW.  They list OKCoin and Huobi as needs clarification, but both of them signed the chinese roundtable supporting segwit2x.  Is the list out of date or something?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:34:14


I'm just referencing the total daily transaction fees versus total daily transaction counts on Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:18:42


Hmm, I wonder if that site is out of date?  Vaultoro is listed as unopposed but they've signed the NYA. And Gemini is listed, but their SEC filings require them to follow the fork that has the most PoW.
Also it doesn't seem to differentiate between "neutral" "no statements" or "opposed"?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:38:00


So if the number did increase, what would that mean?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:55:57


How did they determine that?  Is there some path the transactions were going through that indicated they were spam?  Or some other pattern?
And how is the community's opinion measured?


What I read about was if you go offline at the wrong time, someone else takes your bitcoins instead, even if you were just an intermediary.  During the chain of R disclosures described in the whitepaper

Hmm... I can't find that?  Only thing I could find [was this]( Do you mean the hardfork bit thing that was rejected as breaking SPV wallet compatibility unnecessarily?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:09:01


What was the bit 4 signaling then?

@_date: 2017-08-18 03:30:53


Which ones do without using Bitpay/Coinbase?










Oh, that's a relief.  Why did they say they are?  Where did you see that they aren't?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:52:10


This will only get worse as time goes on unless new people stop using Bitcoin, or blocksize increases happen as they are needed.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:39:30


So if the original chain survived with 1% of users and 1% of hashrate, that would be Bitcoin?  But that's not how people refer to ETC and ETH?
And what if someone started up an early version of Bitcoin today and mined with it?  Would that be Bitcoin?  Because there were several hardforks in the past (0.8.0, CVE-2010-5139, BIP 50).


Where did you see this?  I'm curious to know


I thought Copay was an android app that auto-updates?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:06:46


Didn't BIP148 refuse to put replay protection in?  Were they bad actors as well?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:23:07


Hmm, wait, Peter Todd said in 2013 that we couldn't allow the precedent of a blocksize increase?  And Maxwell has stated that the blocksize should never be increased.  Luke-Jr wants it decreased.  Where's the BIP that you're referring to for a blocksize increase?  104, 106, and 107 were all rejected.  103 and 105 seem like they aren't supported even by their authors anymore?  And the 7 Bitcoin core developers who signed the 2016 2mb increase agreement are now rejecting 2mb?  Something seems off about the trend, or is there something Core has done to support future blocksize increases that I don't know about?


Hm, lightning also seems to require users to be online and have a channel funded by the other side in order to receive money.  And requires them to find a watcher service to prevent from losing money if they go offline...  And what about the possibility of a default-en-masse attack using full blocks against innocent LN users?  Won't lightning have to compete with altcoins that don't have any of those restrictions/issues?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:33:58


How could this be though?  The mining device all use stratum, which doesn't include transaction data?


So if we were to be willing to pay something like $15 per month for a node, how far could we scale then?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:02:55
Hmm, yeah, other people have linked that to me, but I can't figure out if its just out of date or something?  It lists Gemini and Vaultoro non-supporters, but Vaultoro signed and Gemini's SEC filings require them to follow the most PoW chain?
And why doesn't the list differentiate between "no statements" and "neutral" and "reject 2x?" Seems confusing
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:35:05


Hmm, is that out of date?  It lists Vaultoro as not being a supporter but they signed?  And Gemini as not being a supporter, but the terms of their SEC filings require them to follow the most PoW chain?
And why doesn't the list differentiate between "no statements" and "neutral" and "reject 2x?"  Seems confusing

Is there some reason you wouldn't simply upgrade at the point you resume using it?  The fork will have no effect on people not using it.


Oh.  The legacy chain will be the most profitable chain?  How do we know that?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:31:25


What's the worst case?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:59:50


It says it was announced in March well in advance, and coinciding with a Bitcoin conference in New York, and that Adam Back(A HK agreement signer) formally declined to attend:
Where did you see otherwise?  I'd like to have correct info if I'm reading something wrong
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:08:55
So after segwit activates, problem will be solved?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:41:39


How could that be?  Segwit's biggest supporter by current hashrate was BTCC, Chinese?  And F2Pool supported it for a time, also much larger and Chinese...?


Hmm, when I saw it the business "support" on coin.dance was &lt;50% and even less if it was weighted?  And there was the manually conducted opinion poll that only got to 71%... Was 71% something Core was willing to create a coercive fork over?


Yeah, but P2SH wasn't contentious, was it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:49:03


Wait, they didn't?  They're listed as a supporter in many places... Where did they state they don't support segwit2x to correct the false information?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:01:49


Why would BTC1 have very few nodes?  And how quickly would either of those things change if they happened?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:24:29


Hmm, but large enough transactions can't find routes on lightning, right?  So doesn't that mean if people consolidate finances together, like a retailer consolidating payments to pay a vendor, that the customer's channels will become empty after paying retailers and they'll constantly have to refill them?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:37:59
More to that point, doesn't Bitcoin Core use SPV validation by default to skip signature validations on old transactions even today?  It checks block headers and other properties, but not tx signatures.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:09:38


How so?  Bitmain didn't run BCC, and ViaBTC kept 90+% of their miners on BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:24:23
It seems that many of the exchanges, maybe 51% or more, are either supporters of segwit2x or have stated they will follow the most PoW chain
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:04:38


Err, kinda?  Segwit2x is just Bitcoin with a bigger blocksize, i.e., lowering fees and increasing the number of people that can adopt Bitcoin, with the tradeoff that nodes will consume more bandwidth.


Blocks have been full for many months meaning Bitcoin's adoption has hit its limit.  Ethereum's price increase was in part a response to Bitcoin blocks being full with no progress on the scaling conflict.  Transaction fees are above $5 on average today for the second time (early June transaction fees were above $4 per tx on average for more than 2 weeks straight).


Already activated.  Segwit2x is very nearly the same as segwit/Bitcoin.


No, doesn't affect anything like that.
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:08:14
OkCoin?  Bitflyer?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:27:09
Why is it dishonest or unethical?  BTC1 is compatible with segwit exactly as they stated.
If they were to recommend the core client, their customers wouldn't even be able to use Bitpay in 3 months.  It seems like this was the only viable choice, no?  Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:46:01


But to validate transactions they would need to upgrade, right?  And Core wouldn't be compatible with Bitpay itself in 2 months ?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:06:35


BTC1 supports and enables segwit though, right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:49:26


I've seen several polls and lots of support going back months... Where did you get this information?  I'd like to correct my info if it is wrong
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:38:31


What does that have to do with BitPay being unethical?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:50:44
I'm not sure, but it seems like as much as 52% of the exchanges (by volume) support segwit2x right now, plus some that have stated they'll follow the most PoW chain...  Maybe someone will correct my info though...
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:42:35


Why wouldn't no2x trade at $200?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:20:04


Hmm that seems like a good thing to look at for information... Are Ethereum blocks full now?  How many transactions do they process a day, and what's the average fee paid?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:30:13


How is it a trick?  If they recommended anything else it wouldn't be compatible with their own service in 3 months.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:03:52


Ok, but it would be some evidence or something, right?  I've seen some polls and indicates of support... Is there evidence I've missed that there's very strong opposition to 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:31:04
So only a person who has worked on consensus logic before is qualified to work on it again?
Didn't Garzik work on classic and XT?  Didn't Andresen work on the consensus logic of Core?  Or have I been misinformed?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:22:12
Ah, thanks for the link.
I saw somewhere that Garzik said his intention was to address the blocksize portion - the most contentious part - last.  But thanks for correcting me. :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:35:04
Ok, well I'll just hodl on.  Thanks for answering my questions!
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:45:18
So the node count did it?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:28:51


Ok, but it wouldn't work at that point?  If the original chain has no miners?


Are you comparing the chance of the sun not spinning on its axis to the chance that 2x won't be the most profitable chain?  That's a pretty strong statement!


Even if all they are saying is about what they're going to do?  They can't speak about what they plan to do or support?


Ok, so how do we get a better idea of the 2x vs original chain's profitability?  Isn't that the economic consensus?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:34:36


What if they only got 5000 instead of tens of thousands?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:19:15
Hmm, well that's unfortunate, given how people have been talking about it for awhile...  Thanks for clarifying though!
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:55:14
Isn't BCH inflating itself like crazy?  Wouldn't that depress the price?
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:22:16


What are you talking about??


Which is why I'm asking questions?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:52:13


Hmm, wait... If that's occurring, couldn't that longest chain just be doing a 51% attack which nodes are already vulnerable to today?
And if it is a different rule change, if the trustless sync is using a UTXO commitment ~6 months back, that gives the author of the software 6 months to update the software and select the desired fork during the sync process... no?


That might be fine too, but maybe the above example is still trustless?


If more of the world's economy is adopting Bitcoin, couldn't there be more nodes instead of less?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:31:23


Ok, but the softfork would have been dependent on getting 51% of the hashrate... What I searched for showed them having only 0.3%?
And still, wouldn't it make more sense for the minority chain to add replay protection?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:30:09
I asked for info...
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:16:12


What makes it incompatible with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:20:17


Well I'm asking for any information at all to justify what you're saying?  There's information that disagrees; Is there also information that agrees?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:21:05


Someone said it had 60 companies across 22 different countries though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:46:02


Ok, but how much does it cost to run a mining pool?


How so?  It looks like a 1% pool has a revenue of about 2.6 million dollars a year... How much does it cost for them to improve their ratio of verification time to average block time versus bigger pools?


So a 1mb fullnode is consuming 5GB of data up+down?  Or what percentage of that is from the node specifically?  And I guess a bigger question, how much would your node consume if it weren't supporting historical syncing, which seems to be solvable trustlessly with UTXO commitments?
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:52:51
The one that I've seen is here:
This article talks about Brave Browser, Yours (network), and BitCart all leaving over the fees:
Jimmy Wales might even be heading in that direction:
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:39:23


Wait, hold on... What meeting is Greg Maxwell talking about there then?
The actual meeting as far as I can tell took place on the first day of the Consensus 2017 conference, [May 22]( with 9 signatures.  But Barry's tweet went out 5 days prior to that, and [scrolling through]( the history you can see the companies in agreement [building over time](
So when was the private meeting and when was core approached with the compiled statement he's referring to?  Even a month and a half prior to that, news websites had [picked up the proposal]( before anyone mentioned Barry, it was proposed on bitcoin-dev [7 days prior to that]( and the original proposal was [more than 60 days prior to Barry's tweet](
So when was the private meeting Greg is referring to, and the compiled statement they were approached with?  Even in the original reddit thread there are 4 or 5 major core devs responding, so they were aware of it, and [in the reddit thread]( about s2x it was widely approved of.  What's the unethical thing that I'm missing?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:58:57


Right, but that's talking about it as a medium of exchange... And you're talking about it as a store of value only that is less-usable for exchange?


Wouldn't Bitcoin have to compete with other identical mediums of exchange, nearly identical copies of its technology?  What if one of them were just a little bit better than Bitcoin in the long run?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:48:36
And none too soon!  Average transaction fees per day are almost back to $5!
Will Segwit fix the issue and drop fees back down quickly?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:26:49


Why is that bad?  Isn't that what we want?


Isn't the code is done and released?  Some miners like BTCC Bitfury and Bitmain said they're running it I think, how did they do that?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:56:31


They are?  But I thought all DCG companies supported segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:39:21


So the traders are the economic majority?  Wouldn't that mean BCC has nearly doubled in economic support today though, and that Ethereum has become a major threat to BTC?
And wouldn't that mean if &gt;50% of exchanges supported 2x it would be a real problem for us?


That list seems really odd though... Why doesn't it list Garzik or anyone else?  How did they determine who goes on the list and who doesn't?


Ok, that's good, but how can we measure that?  Isn't there something to look at?


Do we really have no clue though?  It's a lot of the exchanges, merchants, and 93% of the miners... Do we just ignore everything they say?  What if they're not lying?


If the rest of the ecosystem leaves us though, won't we lose money because our coins won't be worth as much?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:53:29


If they all left, and all the companies listed left, wouldn't that affect me?  I use some of those companies like coinbase and I've convinced some friends to sign up their business with Bitpay... :/
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:33:39


But isn't the arbitrary blocksize limit the thing creating the immediate problems?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:44:38


Well, isn't around 52% of the exchanges supporting it?  Not to mention huge volume businesses like Circle, Genesis Trading, Bitpay, etc.  Between Coinbase and Bitpay, that's over 90% of the merchants that accept Bitcoin today.  Isn't that the economic majority?  Or wasn't there some website where people could vote with their coins by signing a statement?  What did that say?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:33:47
Oh, they said that?  Where?!?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:07:24


Segwit2x appears to have the economic majority supporting it though, right?  Is there something indicating it doesn't?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:22:52
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:25:14
Agreed.  Upvote for reasonableness! :D
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:36:07


How do you know they aren't already doing that now?
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:01:21


Hmm, how long would that be if it were 10%?


Oh, that's good then.  Which ones?  Have they said they won't follow it?


Hmm, but the assertion of Peter Todd is that it isn't Bitcoin?  Do they have some way they're measuring the opinions of the users?
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:28:01


If you can't give good answers that actually address the issue, I'll talk to someone else.


But [what]( about [the]( actual [polls]( and the broad support among the [measurable]( entities like coins, businesses and blocks?
Surely there's some data that says the opposite of those?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:57:21
Lol.  If only you knew what it was like to have as many coins as I do...
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:44:56


I get my gun?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:45:56


Doesn't that mean usage is important?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:04:42


Hmm, but it seems like more than half the exchanges by volume support segwit2x, no?
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:32:07


Garzik didn't work on Bitcoin before?
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:10:57
Thanks, let me know
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:40:07
Bitcoin isn't supposed to be about lambo's...
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:56:20
Bitcoin does create a pretty strong censorship resistant system.  The funds can't be frozen, and payments can't be blacklisted like they did with Wikileaks a few years back.  The exchanges make for a weak point though.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:03:20


In foreign countries, these requirements are lower.  Much, much lower than using any Bitcoin exchange, which you have to do to convert the money, so this isn't an added requirement.


No they can't.  Transactions can't be reversed except by a chain re-org, which has nothing to do with where your node is.  How on earth are you imagining that they would stop you from transacting with ... anyone?


Uh, where did you hear this?  They absolutely cannot.  Just because you run a node somewhere doesn't mean you store your keys there.  If anything goes wrong, you shut down service with them and spin up a node in a foreign country.  SPV + light client connecting to your own node = completely trustless.


Same with your home, except they have multiple levels of redundant power and internet?


There's no trust added by running your own node in a datacenter.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:32:48


Weren't many people objecting to 2x calling itself "Bitcoin" if it happens to be worth more though?
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:36:05
It doesn't say they have 10,100,000 AML verified users.  That's almost certainly just 10,100,000 accounts; I'd be impressed if even 50% of those had passed AML verification.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:21:38


Do you have the mask diagrams for your CPU?  Did you verify the pinouts?
If not, you're trusting them.  And the motherboard manufacturer.  And windows if you use it, or Android if you use that.  And if you don't recompile linux from scratch - after verifying the code you downloaded - hoo boy!  [And even your keyboard](
Why are datacenters any different than that?
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:58:20
HSBC really seems like the worst bank of all of them though
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:53:23
Why is that necessarily bad?  There's a tremendous amount of competition among datacenters and cloud service providers
