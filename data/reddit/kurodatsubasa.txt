While I agree it would be too easy, making it a totally random IP address can be hardly called a puzzle unless there is some clever trick.

I placed an order 1 hour ago through API, and it was fine.

Congratulations to the winners! Well, a good excuse to not switch to Ledger since I was planning to probably get Trezor one day.

What a click bait. Not going to register/subscribe just for one article.

No, the 2 years is not the time it takes to download it, but how far behind is your stored blockchain on PC. Just give it a couple of hours depending on how fast your internet is.

Do you actually need to verify your identity? I only needed to add my bank details and credit card (if you want to instantly buy 100$ worth of bitcoins) to buy bitcoins from coinbase.

You can manage your Bitcoin Core wallet by importing your wallet.dat or private key to the bitcoin web wallet.
The most popular one probably would be blockchain.info.
However, you are free to look for other web wallets.

I think they are using SanDisk Cruzer 128GB USB 2.0 (Link to Amazon:  ).
They should have gone with SanDisk Ultra Fit one. It's much smaller and same capacity (Link to Amazon:  ).

You are probably right, but I am personally using Ultra Fit without any issues. I did have frequent disconnections in the beginning until I figured out that rpi was the source of a problem and fixed it easily.
Yeah, it seems to be overpriced. I can buy components by myself and configure rpi 2 with 32 gb micro sd, 128 flash drive, wifi adapter, and small touchscreen for about $180. 
If you are sure that you have forwaded the port, give it some time.

Pretty nice. I am planning to write a bitcoin ticker for Pebble too. Waiting for my Pebble Time Steel to arrive.
