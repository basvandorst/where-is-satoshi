I'm sure that wasn't 2k in shots. Dogs have medical problems too. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:01:57
You're still not addressing what would happen to all of the dogs that are currently being sold by breeders and pet stores. Kill a few for the greater good?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:58:17
What's a sell wall? Honest question
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:22:27
Ok? Plenty of people bought in at lower than 13K

To the newcomers: HODL
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:15:56
What if I told you not all purebred breeders are puppy mills?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:07:12
Right, because you never had the opportunity to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:15
These aren't stocks 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:58
Right, because everyone bought in at peak... And didn't buy the 11K dip. Gtfo.
U mad because Bitcoin didn't crash to zero as you expected?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:39
Great argument. What are you suggesting we do with the current mill and breeder dogs then? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:21:18
Lol what. 2deep4me
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:14:00
So she shouldn't have given a home to this dog? Let this one die for the sake of your argument?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:22:47
Lol lost money?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:03:03
I get the principal, it simply raises another moral/ethical dilemma for so-called animal lovers. You're punishing the innocent dogs that have already been bred.
It's simply saying have a bunch die so that more will live in the future.
Edit: removed extra word
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:03:15
My entire point is the "that sucks" part. It's an upfront cost for greater good downstream... That's an ethical dilemma when you're talking about animal lives. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:03:08
Lol. Bitcoin is up by several hundred percent over the past year. What a "bounce"
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:11:03
So in your view, all current puppies from non- mill breeders should go without a home, just to drive down demand? Your logic fails there.
Edit: someone downvoting, please explain how I'm wrong.

I think we should get to the root of the problem... People adopting or buying dogs that they can't take care of, leading to an abundance of pets in shelters.

Look at the year while you're at it...

*future hodls
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:23:23
There's been no better investment over the past year than Bitcoin. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:55:41
There's that *stinkin'* personality creeping up again!
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:17:51
No, I read it correctly. You're making excuses for character flaws, but it's not that big of a deal. If you don't mind sharing, what country are you from?
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:00:35
"I'm a jerk, but it's part of my *culture*!!"
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:30:07
It's fine, we forgive you.
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:20:36


That's a matter of opinion, certainly. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:15:58
Not illegal by any means. But the rapid microsecond trading advantages have always been a bit unsettling. Hard to see where the future lies in it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:49:02
You should read the biography then
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:09:16
Tired of all that winning yet?
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:18:02
Lol is fine. Sorry if it bothers your Trump agenda.
