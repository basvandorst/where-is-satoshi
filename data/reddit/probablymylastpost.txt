I used SteamLoader to buy over 1200 euro in games over the past week. There is a market. Also, it is my obligation to the people who run SteamLoader to mention that  is legit and a really good service!

Governments taking taxes from people equals theft, since they take money without the intention of giving it back... and you have no choice in it.
Governments expect all people to pay taxes, banks expect all people to pay off their debts. But governments can't pay off their debts, banks only poses a small amount of the money they keep. Governments and banks have the largests debts of all and they get away with it.
I don't want to support any government... I can't help being born here where they lay these rules on me. No one asked me whether I agreed to them, I just have to live with it. It's not how things should work.

I understand how it 'works' and I understand how I'm 'wrong'. Don't worry, you won't insult me, feel free to say anything. You know, about half of my salary goes to the government. Then, they charge 21% over everything I buy, 70% over gasoline. It's not my choice to pay for all this. The government uses my tax money for the wrong causes. Most of the money goes to companies lobbying. And with all the taxes the government takes, they still don't have enough money and need to borrow more. People in the government 'gamble' with our money but they don't lose their money: At the end of the month, they all get a paycheck... even if the haven't accomplished anything or, as it is now in The Netherlands, only made matters worse. Now, if they would use my tax money to take care of people who aren't lucky enough to have a job, a house or even food... I'd be okay with it. But they use money to pay other governments, banks, insurance companies...
They don't give (enough) back to the people who need it.
