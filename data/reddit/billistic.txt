Yes, he comes off crazy and weird but most brilliant people do.
He has a good point and we can all see it. Cyprus is in trouble with their currency and look what happened to the price of bitcoin.
That's how big Cyprus is. Imagine what happens when Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy start having to do some fancy footwork with their money.
Also, look at large banks like HSBC who need to launder money from drug scams they were running, they'll all be buying bitcoin too.
One big financial collapse in April could mean the American dollar going crazy and guess what happens then.

They're expensive, use your money to buy bitcoins when and if they go down. By the time you've mined a couple of coins you'll probably already have a ton of them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:48
It will be, I'm sure the gold that came from the first mines weren't easily accessible.

@_date: 2013-08-31 17:52:30
Yes. Buy now. Buy one Bitcoin for every kid in your family for Christmas. If you wait for Christmas the price will be higher because people will want to buy them as gifts.
Also Syria and WW3 might have started and the price would have really gone up.
Then Xmas comes and you go here you little shits, here's your fucking bitcoin, marry fucking christmas and they'll look at the value being upwards of 300 and they'll think you're the bestest person ever merry fucking christmas.
Then tell them not to spend it until they're like 50.

Usually vessels take humanity to a better place. Ships took people from England to greener pastures.
Sure ships sink here an there, you have a titanic from time to time but one the whole we move on up.
But the train ticket had gone from something given out to miners for mining to 250 a pop, that's most than most can afford so the train has left for them. It might return but they might not be THAT interested in it and miss out again.
I guess the point is bitcoin is the first open source digital currency on the planet.

I think this would only effect the price of bitcoin once the initial bitcoin shares had been bought. Then Winklevosses would have to get more coins and that's when the price will change.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:40:36
I've been loving bitcoinary, they have an escrow system and people are willing to take email money transfers you can send through your bank's online system.
@_date: 2013-09-03 22:09:07
Why not?
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:58:22
@_date: 2013-09-26 13:48:58
I meant people would buy bitcoins as a gift
@_date: 2013-08-31 03:50:42
I think it's because of Syria.
People like me were planning on buying some bitcoin and when the whole syria war machine started cranking up they decided they better get out and get their transactions out of the way before they were hiding under a stairway somewhere.
Besides, everyone here knows if shit hits the fan and world currencies start getting fucked we'll be unaffected and our bitcoins will be worth billions after WW3.
@_date: 2013-09-09 14:19:41
not sure why....
@_date: 2013-08-23 04:24:33
Alright, ya got a bank. When you make a transaction your bank gets behind you and goes "This guy did put 20 dollars here, what of it?" and people go well fuck the guy must have put 20 dollars there because the bank said so and banks don't lie and for this service banks take a little more money from you as a transaction fee to keep their infrastructure (house of cards) up and running.
So if we wanted to make an online currency we'd need some way to track transactions like a bank does but who's going to do this and to do it they're going to want something for their time and energy to watch transactions.
So Bitcoin works by taking the job of the bank of watching and keeping track of transactions and distributes that job to anyone who wants it.
The people that want that job are called miners. They watch transactions happen and verify that they do. For their effort they're given some bitcoins out of a big pool the miners get based on a 12 cent transaction fee that you pay every time you use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-31 17:05:26
Yeah but they get paid to do it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:33:50
And people can't understand why bitcoin is better than cash.

@_date: 2013-08-30 17:51:02
I did not know that. Good thing I asked! Thanks!
Well I figure if you give someone a bar of gold you should give them a total bar. So when they go to sell the coin one day (or use it) I want them to be able to use it as one whole bar. Are you saying it's hopeless because they might up the transfer fee in the future?

@_date: 2013-03-31 18:46:30
If your government one day said "Hey, shit's fucked up, we're going to grab money out of accounts to cover shit"
What would you do? You'd get your money out as fast as possible and try to put it in stuff that has value elsewhere.
Gold is expensive and you have to keep it on you, also in your area the price of gold would probably be skyrocketing and most people sold their gold to those gold buyers that sprung up everywhere.
So what do you do with your money?
Want evidence? Look at the price of Bitcoin.

Either that or the elite created bitcoin and they're the ones who have 50% of bitcoin that they say Satoshi holds and they want the world to move to one currency and that currency is bitcoin and eventually you'll have bitcoin wallet ids on RFID chips that you'll want to get injected because it's the safest way to hold your bitcoin inside your body. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:02:17
Yeah but dude.
MP3. Bitcoin is the MP3 of money.
I remember a time when Afrosquad had to take a desktop computer and rebuild it under his car seat and then plugged it in to the car's stereo and had to get a power converter so the car would power the computer so he could have a large MP3 collection playable in their car.
Now you get in your car with your iphone and connect to your car with bluetooth and play mp3s off your phone.
Today the music industry runs on MP3.
By the way, the MP3 was hampered by technology. When the MP3 came out there wasn't technology that would allow you to hold more than 7 songs in your pocket and that mp3 player cost 125 bucks. It wasn't cheaply possible to hold files on your person.
For Bitcoin, there is no hampering by technology. Thanks to MP3 having many files being available on your person is easily possible. Having a screen that displays QR codes is possible. We live in the information age now, did you think money was going to stay on paper? Nothing else really has.
Being on the ground floor of the beginning of digital currency will inevitably have it's benefits. You know how much pussy having a car that played 5000 songs would've gotten you at one time? Now girls wouldn't give a fuck.

Gradual transition to BTC would have happened if global markets weren't fucked.
Since Europe is in such shit and America not far off I can easily see how BTC could inflate and takeover. It'll take over Internet payment to replace credit cards when money dies and then everyone's daily transactions will go from there.

Bitcoinary.com - It's like ebay with bitcoins, find a seller that takes interac money transfers. They put the bitcoin on escrow on the site. You login to your bank's website, send them an interac money transfer to the email they told you to send it to. Once they get their money they release the escrow and you get to specify where to send your coin. Paste in your wallet address and you're done.
Ideally after a while you find a bitcoin dealer you trust and you just send them the money without escrow. First time use the escrow for sure.
