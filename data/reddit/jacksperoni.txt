Dude just sell. Stop listening to reddit, bitcoin isn't going up and will be worth very little
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:04:25
Sell your bitcoins, the price is not going to go up
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:47:57
No sell ur fuckin bitcoins before you lose it all. 
If you haven't recognized this as a bubble bursting, or as a retarded high risk investment then I think you're maybe delusional.. 
Lock in ur gains

People right now aren't even using bitcoin. It has to many flaws to be able to become a realistic currency. I find it hard to believe that the price will stabilize and people will start using it. I think the overwhelming majority of demand in bitcoin is for people to make money fast, not as a currency option. Just look around this sub. That being said it'll be easy to make money fast as who knows where bitcoin is going, but people should be prepared for a crash that will happen so fast. 
Expression of my feelings? Cmon man

Don't worry brah bitcoin will be dead by then

Right it's a very fragile reserve of value. It's very prone to imploding. Bitcoin mania will end at one point, and I have doubts peiple will buy BTC if they think it won't increase in the future

A lot of the people I know who are in bitcoin have no other investments. And I think if you're educated than u should know it's not a good way to save money. 
We're in bitcoin mania right now bro. It could be a good time to get in but also a time where it could collapse

I'd sell rn. Dont lose your gains. Be very careful buying corrections 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:47:01
I can use it too but I won't and haven't, it just doesn't make sense. Actually I used to order fake IDs from china, and people use it for illegal drug shipping.
Historically, gold was used as currency until like the 1940s or whenever it was. 
Bitcoin being so volatile it doesn't make it a reasonable store of value. In fact there is absolutely no reason for BTC to be worth so much right now. People are buying to make money fast. One major correction can lead to a huge panic.
How many people do u know own bitcoin? How many of those people are investors in other things?

"invest in bitcoin because it will grow accordingly" 
I have a lot of respect for people on this sub because you guys seem ballsy as hell and have unbelievable faith in bitcoin...
However what's driving its growth? Sounds like it has no use except as something that people feel like they can buy them sell to someone for more money. It barely has any use as payment. There's absolutely no value behind it that would command this high of a valuation. 
I'd sell rn, it's a big giant bubble. Don't lose all your gains. The turkey never knows what day thanksgiving is
