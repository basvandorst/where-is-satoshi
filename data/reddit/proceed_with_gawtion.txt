Politico had an article last year about Galloway:
I doubt he'll be elected Mayor of London, but he likely does represent the future of Britain. Someday there likely will be someone with his views as Mayor, or PM. And those with opposing views will be "punched in the head" and arrested.

Given the evidence provided by the XT and Classic fork attempts, I think it's unlikely we'll find out who was right or wrong.
I will say, however, that I've communicated with people who assure me that if such a fork attempt is successful, they will release a fork of Bitcoin using SHA3 (with Luke Jr's patch) to continue the original chain. Someone suggested "Bitcoin CoKe" for "Core with Keccak." I understand the argument that the short-term economic incentives are for everyone to get behind either CoKe or Classic, but many people have a long-term economic incentive to make it clear that the system *will not change* unless almost everyone agrees. Right now not everyone agrees. In fact, again, the evidence provided by both the XT and Classic attempts are that those who want to hard fork to raise the block size limit (at least for now) are in the minority.
I think you're wrong, Gavin, but not "as usual," and I respect the work you've done to help Bitcoin succeed. I believe you've been pushing for big blocks in good faith.

These were clearly not death threats, but other than that I agree: making death threats against people with power is stupid.
Here's a different strategy. People with power have families. Find those family members and have people follow them around with a video camera (surreptitiously). There are so many laws, it's clear that eventually you'll have evidence of one of those family members commiting a crime. Then try to get them crushed beneath the wheels of "justice."
If spying on the family members of government agents seems over some line, keep in mind how much information they gather on the rest of us.

That's odd. I've been reading threads about this issue all year, and it seemed to me there were two sides. One side legitimately thinks the block size must be raised as soon as possible to allow for sudden growth. The other side has legitimate concerns about what this could do to the security and decentralization of the network, e.g., ability to run nodes behind Tor. I didn't realize those concerns were just a smokescreen so that Blockstream could insist on 1MB blocks in order to break Bitcoin and maximize their evil corporate profits. Funny how they got so many people unaffiliated with Blockstream to voice similar concerns.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:12:06
It would only take 26% (more or less) of miners to do this, along with 49% honestly signaling support for bigger blocks. The result would be two chains with similar hashing power. I could even imagine a mining pool openly saying they're doing this. It's a legitimate defensive strategy.

It's just one of many strategies to save bitcoin. It basically says to the XTers, go ahead, have your alt coin. We will keep our bitcoin. Sometimes divorce is the best solution. The main question now is whether or not it will be messy, or rather how messy it will get.

Does this "vote" remain open until there's 75% of miners (even if that happens years from now)? It seems like the idea is to keep voting until the voters get the "right" answer.

With 25% of miners blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain will be mined approximately once every 40 minutes for a month or two until the difficulty is adjusted. Bitcoin can survive it.

Maxwell, as well as many other Core devs, have taken an enormous amount of abuse. I regularly see them called liars and accused of scheming to "cripple" Bitcoin. I'd never want to be in their positions. It underscores how important it was that Satoshi remained anonymous. There are many evil people in the world.
If Maxwell decides he's taken enough abuse and decides he'd be happier leaving the space, I wouldn't blame him at all. It would be bad for Bitcoin, which is a bit bad for me, but he should do what's best for him. He's already earned his place as a very important part of the history of cryptocurrency.

CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) should help. You could create and broadcast a new transaction spending the unconfirmed transaction output, paying a fee big enough to make the confirmation of both transactions appealing. If you're interested in doing this, post the txid and the output that belongs to you. If I'm still online (maybe within an hour or two?) I can help you create the new tx. Otherwise, I'm sure someone else can help.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:50:46
Thanks for saving me the time of watching it. John Oliver can be funny at times, but that doesn't make his content Bitcoin related.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:58:23
Open Bitcoin-QT and choose "Debug Window" from the Help menu.
To create the new tx do this:
createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"deadd123f8825c5cde4fffcccf422cab69df6b2add59f09ab6dad89bced97225","vout":0}]' '{"1NKmmsUs7qn8eBYFo13nN2C87QwJGZBhiB":6.89766516}'
This is assuming you want to use a 5 millibit fee. Otherwise, adjust the output value.
Bitcoin-QT should give you the following output:
In fact, if you're willing to use a 5 mbit fee, you can skip the createrawtransaction step and just use the output I'm giving you. You can double check that this tx does what I'm saying (spends your output to yourself), you can use a tool to decode. For example, go to:
and copy in the long hex string above (01...00) into the box. It should confirm (and you should double check) that the tx has one output, to 1NKmmsUs7qn8eBYFo13nN2C87QwJGZBhiB, of 689766516 satoshis. I strongly recommend you do make this check before continuing. I know I am not cheating you, but someone with admin access to reddit could simply replace the hex string above so that the tx spends to their address. So double check it before continuing. Be paranoid!
Now you can sign the transaction in the Debug Window of Bitcoin-QT. If the private key is in your Bitcoin-QT wallet, signing works as follows:
signrawtransaction 01..00
where 01..00 is the long hex string you double checked above. If you do not have your private key in your QT wallet, but you have the private key, you can sign it as follows:
signrawtransaction 01..00 [] '["&lt;private key in WIF format&gt;"]'
The private key in WIF format should be a long string of characters (about 50?) starting with 5, or L or K. Even if you're not sure if you have the right private key, don't worry. Trying to sign with the wrong private key will simply fail and nothing bad will happen.
After you do signrawtransaction you'll have an even longer hex string. You can again double check it with  just to be doubly sure.
Then send it. You can send it from Bitcoin-QT's Debug Window as follows:
sendrawtransaction &lt;long hex string from previous step&gt;
Or you can send it through blockchain.info by going to
and putting the new long hex string into the box and pressing "Submit Transaction."
OK, I know it's a long process. But this is your best chance of making it likely your payment gets confirmed. Good luck.
I suppose I should say: use this at your own risk. There should be no risk, but I don't want the blame if something goes wrong.
Edit: If you don't have Bitcoin-QT, there is probably a way to sign the transaction in Electrum. And in other wallets, but I can't advise on that. I'd recomment just getting QT (well, Bitcoin Core is what I mean, QT is the old name) and using it as stated above. You don't need to wait for it to download the blockchain, so you should be able to do the steps with QT immediately.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:45:24
Yes, I see now that there is an unconfirmed tx spending the output (hopefully to addresses in your wallet). The fee you paid in the new tx is 0.259 mbits (about 20 cents). That's a good fee for the single new tx, but very low for the first (&gt;5K) tx. The combined fees of the tx are just over 10 satoshis per byte. It might go through, but I'm not confident. (Good luck.)
If the two txs don't confirm soon, you might consider spending the coins (again!) but with a very high fee (like 5 mbits). The trouble is that the original tx is very big.
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:54:18
Oh, I hadn't heard that miners stopped supporting CPFP. It's surprising, because CPFP is profitable for miners. (There are good reasons why RBF is preferable, but for cases like this one CPFP seems to be the only alternative.)
By the way, the original unconfirmed tx is 5.3K and paid a fee of 0.3 mbits. My recommendation was that do CPFP with a fee of 5 mbits. (The number of bitcoins at stake is almost 7 bitcoins.) Let me know if you think a 5 mbit fee is appropriate.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:23:29
Sorry, you just missed me yesterday. You need to create, sign and broadcast a transaction spending your unconfirmed bitcoins to yourself, but with a relatively high fee (enough to pay for both unconfirmed transactions). The tx that isn't yet confirmed was very large and with a comparitively low fee. If left alone, it's likely it won't confirm. I'll walk you through what to do in the next comment. It assumes you have Bitcoin-QT and the private key for 1NKmmsUs7qn8eBYFo13nN2C87QwJGZBhiB. You do not need to have downloaded the block chain.
Edit: Based on the size of the tx, I'm going to suggest you pay a fee of 5 mbits (a little less then $4). That's high, but given that there are almost 7 bitcoins at stake, better to err on the high side. A 3.8 mbit fee (about $3) would also probably be safe.

It's not clear who forged the version v8. The initial accusation was that it was the CEO of OKCoin, Star Garza. But Star Garza swore before God and Charman Pao that he didn't do it, so obviously he didn't do it.
Then there were those accusations that the private key for OKCoin's cold storage were in the hands of his wife Jessica and her glass dildo, but that's obviously not true too. Otherwise, the glass dildo would've stolen the coins by now.
Something like that. My memory's fuzzy.
Plus, for what it's worth, the glass dildo is OK with 20MB.

There's no way to determine it. Of course, Coinbase could tell people, but I don't think they acknowledge the issue at all. In any case, they'd be expected to lie so they aren't a credible source.
Outside actors could do experiments. (I can't help. I don't use Coinbase because I don't cooperate with the Stasi.) This would provide some idea, but one could never be sure without having the algorithm they use.
By the way, the simple solution is not to use Coinbase. They are evil, after all, and not doing business with evil people should be the obvious option.
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:12:41
I would assume so. Many Palestinians within the 67ish borders are full citizens of Israel, with all the rights that come with that. If there's ever a peace settlement with a 2-state solution, it's clear that those Palestinians will be able to remain, as citizens, in Israel. By contrast, no one reasonably believes Jews will be able to live in the newly created Palestine, just as Jews are not welcome (or safe) throughout the Middle East. Just as Jews are not welcome (or safe) in much of Europe. It's strange that people don't talk about that more often, considering the obvious implications. Maybe that's why they don't talk about it.

It's certainly an imperfect analogy for many reasons. But in Anne Frank's case the ultimate reason the Black Market was needed was Hitler. In Ross Ulbricht's case the ultimate reason the Black Market was needed is Obama. Everything else aside, I think we can all agree that Obama is similar to Hitler. Certainly both of them have crowds of enthusiastic supporters who love the speeches and will do anything their Dear Leader says. I mean, Obama hasn't killed as many Jews, sure, but that's just because Obama is kind of lazy.

Most Jews are like most people, so I'd assume some of them love Bitcoin, some of them hate Bitcoin and most of them have no opinion about Bitcoin.
There's certainly some evidence that a large contingent of Bitcoiners have a problem with Jews. They seem to be quick to believe in "International Jewish Banking" conspiracies or that "Jews did 9/11" and so on. At least, I hope the percentage of Bitcoiners I read these things from is higher than the general population.
Not all Bitcoiners are Jew-haters, obviously. I'm not. In fact, I think Bitcoin will be very beneficial to intelligent people, in which case Bitcoin will ultimately benefit Jews far more than Jew-haters. Of course, if I'm right, then the Jew-haters will just decide that Bitcoin was yet another conspiracy of the *Ewige Jude*. Sad.
