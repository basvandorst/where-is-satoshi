Hey, thanks for the suggestion. Will consider it – we don't have fees for moving BTC in/out of app like we will for USD, in part because the Bitcoin market is more anti-fees :) And dropping the 1% per-bet fee may make sense as well. I would certainly prefer people using it for free than not using it at all!

I'm sorry, we only allow payment in countries where we've done the legal research to make sure that it's legal, and we haven't gotten to DK yet!

😆😂 We're working on bank account integration, after which if they lose, they can send you USD, and if you lose, you can send them BTC. (And then they'll be like "wtf do I do with these bits you sent me?", and the answer is either get Coinbase or send it to other players when you make more bets and lose.)

My bad! Yeah, I don't have any friends into bitcoin either, and it's been a struggle trying to convert some :)

Thanks a lot! Let me know if you or your friends have any suggestions for the app: loren
Nice app, looks simple and useful, gave it 5 stars :) 
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:33:03
Yeah, at this point it's mainly meant for using with people you know, not strangers, and the per-bet limit is $300.

The app isn't actually for gambling, only for non-binding predictions:

Because they might value these things:
Setting the terms (some people forget or "misremember" them), getting a reminder when it's time to judge, appointing a 3rd party judge, bet for charity, upload photos of the bet, maintain a history of bets with statistics on how well you've done, compete with friends over those statistics, and see your friends' bets (instead of all of their financial transactions).

You gotta start somewhere! ☺️ Just launched, and so far most of our users are on iOS.

Thank you! X fee-free transfers is definitely something we have on the possible-feature list. On USD in/out, it's not only wanting to make money, but also covering the fees we are charged, which can add up, as Venmo found out in the early days when they were doing free CC transfers.

Yes, when you make a $10 parlay, the only way to pay the winner is with $10 worth of BTC. It's explained during onboarding.

The app is closed-source, and bitcoin is only used as the payment method, not for storing the bets themselves.

1% fee charged to the winner (you send $10, they receive $9.90)
Another 1% fee goes to the judge if you appoint one. Free to move BTC in/out of app, but $1 fee to move USD into/out of app (once we launch bank account integration).

Thanks! We're trying 😅
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:02:12
$300, and all money transfers are optional.

Thank you! Right now the app is using a traditional database and not storing bets on the blockchain. If we can prove out the market for social betting and remain in business long enough, I'd like to open up the platform on the blockchain (instead of providing a traditional app API), with trust minimization through a large body of oracles.
Atm bitcoin is just used as the payment method, implemented first because it's easiest to set up and fee-free.
