Edit -
Here’s the video I watched about Bitpay this morning.

Wouldn’t that defeat most of the purpose of segwit if only one lane of the highway is optimized.  
I don’t have a clue how many txs they have coming in and out but I feel like out is more than in.  
I do feel like what you suggested is a good start though. 
Just my two cents.

I’d like to get a question in if that’s ok.  
Say in a world with lightning and bitcoin is boss. 
 
My paychecks comes in bitcoin and I get paid every two weeks this is a good reason to have this channel open with my job or jobs “bank” bank node... I don’t know the correct term.  
 
This node is connected to my grocery store gas station Starbucks etc.  what I’m getting at is places I may go once a week, twice a week, or daily.  
Now I don’t want my paycheck to be on this channel I want it in my wallet.  But I don’t wanna close the channel because I have everyday living expenses to do.  
Is it a fee to get on the channel and a fee to get off? 
Do we know about how much the fees are gonna be? Small fees big fees?
Can I get a explanation for this scenario please or something similar. Please and thank you :)
Don’t know how this question comes off but it’s is genuinely wanting to know what my future looks like in bitcoin with lightning.

When he’s talking about the futures shorting and them having to buy bitcoin to cover the short which in turn drives the price up even more.  
Which makes sense but I thought futures were cash settled as in you settle your position in cash not in the underlying asset which is bitcoin. 
  
Is this not how it works or am I just not understanding something?

Like others have stated try to find one with segwit. I ended up going with ledger Nano S. (It isn’t a app on your phone though)
