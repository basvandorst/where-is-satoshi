That's been very true so far. I was lucky to catch one of the dips today, although I am not too concerned about short term price. I am a believer of bitcoin being a lot more valuable a few years from now.

I read this about cavirtex - 
Also, I can't get quickbt to work. They seem to have been down for a while. I'm not in Vancouver, so is localbitcoins in Calgary my only option?

Damn, LibertyBit sounds like it would have been great. It's a shame they're not around anymore. 
I can see what you're saying about the irreversible nature of bitcoin transactions, so I guess the verification has its purpose. Having said that, I have to wonder why it seems so much easier on quickbt. Something to do with the limit on how much you can buy at a time?
Anyway, thanks for all the advice. It's a lot to think about right now, but I'll be doing more research and hopefully making a purchase some time after the next correction.

Haha, I've been following it. I still need to figure out how to set up a wallet, anyway.

Just so I'm understanding this correctly, when was the last period of a few weeks when people should have bought, according to the graph?
Immediately after that spike in April, or later in the summer?

I understand. I had just been watching today up until the big dip an hour ago, so I was only really thinking of hopping on short-term (with that momentum it seemed like it could go up another couple hundred within the day). 
However, I am completely new to this and didn't foresee the hassle in creating a trading account, in terms of verification and the potential wait. I think I will sit back for now and try to learn more in the meantime, probably buy in the period you suggest - if I have it figured out by then. 
Thanks for your advice. It's much appreciated.

quickbt is down for me. If it works later, do I just need a debit card? Any other verification?
I read this about cavirtex - 
Looked into vaultofsatoshi, but it seems that their verification is a little bit much as well. Also, the payment methods accepted are not as convenient as using a debit card. 
The price on canadianbitcoins.com seems a bit steep. 
Hopefully some of this can be cleared up, or there's some other compromise. Thanks for all the info.

Point taken. That was the plan, anyway.

I live in Calgary. Thanks for the suggestions. Keep the input coming, guys!

Hahaha, I saw! I still figure that it would be good to know what the hell I'm doing in case I do want to buy tomorrow or at some other point in time. Thanks for the advice.
