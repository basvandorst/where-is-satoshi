Why would Snowden confirm this leak, this seems like another example of him attacking/harming the United States? Why would he do this? Or was this just Greenwald harming the United States since he now has control/power over Snowden's trove of damaging government secrets?

This is an example of the conspiracy mumbo jumbo, look at my edit to my comment for further details. You should not link or visit a website that has that horrible of a track record. There are far better sources with better track records where you don't risk being misinformed.

Zero hedge is a conspiracy theory website that is always telling people to buy gold and doomsday supplies. It would be wise to not get your financial news from a website like this. Does this sub regularly get their financial news from this website? 
EDIT: Just I suspected. I was skeptical he would argue such an absurd position and I was correct, his quote doesn't have him advocate going back to the gold standard, it is the author taking extreme liberties with a quote of his. 
The key to understanding why this is an absurd position is to understand where credit comes from today and the incredible amount of economic growth and prosperity that this credit allows.

If you were a rational person swayed by logical arguments, a few of those posts should have changed some of your views. I am curious as to why you felt compelled go through my comment history. The reasons people do so is usually because they want to deny some truth that is presented to them via logical fallacy.
If the world ever had to ever "revert to the gold standard", or an alternative currency like bit coin, rest assured, western civilization would have collapsed and suffering and death would dominate the lands. It is important to know where the value of modern/current currency comes from and how it relates to the quality of life of people and prosperity experienced by humans now. 
Why did you go through my comment history and why ask what my interest in bit coin is?

So when the Nazis and white supremacists organized the "unite the right rally", that was all just liberal propaganda in your mind?

Are you implying that Russia did not try to influence the 2016 American election and is not trying to undermine the United States government/people?

Oh okay, a Russian supported one thanks for letting me know. Makes perfect sense now that I think about it.

I think you have spent too much time arguing with "radical leftists" because they have zero power, zero influence, zero potential power, and zero potential influence. Those people have nothing to do with actual "leftist" policy positions in America. You have also demonstrated your ignorance of how academia in the western world works(and across the world in general), that is not a surprise though since the right has has spent a lot of time and countless resources trying to discredit the most informed people on subjects/experts for political reasons. This ridiculous conspiracy theory that academia and the most informed humans across the ENTIRE WORLD at the best univerities across continents are a part of this "liberal boogeyman", their global academic consensus is obviously some American liberal plot... Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? You might as well be saying the Nazis that organized the Unite the Right rally and involved in it were a part of a left wing false flag operation. They are in the EXACT same ballpark, please obtain some self awareness. I am now going to ask the most dreaded question any conservative can be asked, where do you get your information from? Honestly, don't lie. Where do you get your information from? How on earth do you think academic consensus(which spans the entire world) is the product of some cold war Marxist plot trying to undermine the western world?

Are you serious? The guy above literally said liberals pretended to be nazis to kill protesters in order make Alex Jones and the alt right look bad. You are an idiot if you think this, where do you people come up with this ridiculous nonsense? Are you defending this theory? "Liberal false flag operation"... if you think this is a thing then you need to be more critical and questioning of your information sources. You are aware a literal Nazi organized the Unite the right rally right?

Not at all, Trump has never had a chance, and to my knowledge there has never been a president in U.S history that had this background. The super rich people you see run for president are just blinded by their narcissism and delusional, or looking to have the single issues they are strong in, absorbed by another mainstream candidate. The only billionaire that could remotely have a chance of winning, but it would still be a long shot, is Michael Bloomberg, who was the mayor of New York city. 
One can make a flimsy argument and say an oligarchy exists because of the way campaigns are funded, but that would be stretching the meaning of the word. Anyone who uses that word to describe the U.S. Government, as an oligarchy, is just trying to be edgy and doesn't know the meaning of it or is not aware of how things work.
