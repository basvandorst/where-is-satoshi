what are your thoughts on it?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:14:13
Yeah, would love to hear your thoughts

How about you offer to sell the pdf's for $20 flat. You could build a pretty large email list of people that want the updates. You'd probably make a lot more money off quantity. I'll be your first customer! I would send out the updates with a new email address though so that Ronnie's team can't track you down.

The guy is repeating the same prediction with different tech.

My ledger nano s just arrived in the mail today. Have had my coins in a paper wallet in the meantime though. Excited to use it!

Have you subscribed to his newsletter?

Nice! A Depreciating asset! But hey... YOLO!

Well don't you think lots of businesses would like to shove some business under the rug. Doesn't Crypto make that super easy where now in order to stay off the books you have to pay in CASH. Unless you pay someone in cash, there are bank records of the transaction which the govt can trace. I'm not fluent in finance &amp; taxes so I could be talking out of my ass here.

You are wrong. Mining is just a very misleading, poorly chosen word to describe what they're actually doing. Mining just refers to the process of verifying transactions. The blockain rewards the miners with Bitcoin. When the coin runs out, the miners will still be charging fees for transactions.

But this is way different. This makes it easy for the average person to evade taxes. It will also require ALOT more effort by the IRS to hunt these people down.
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:36:38
Yeah, actually realized that after I posted. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:58:54
I was thinking the same thing. Maybe make nicely printed signs with colors, logos, QR Codes and public keys.
I rarely give money to homeless anymore because I dont carry cash. This is the perfect solution.

As the drunken saying goes... HODL!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:38:01
I like this. I’m sure someone had tried something like this
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:17:28
You know what's weird... I saw a different person sitting in his same spot... with his same dogs and chairs. Suspicious...
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:15:57
That's very true, but enough will figure out the truth.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:50:16
Yup, right on Sunset and Vine.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:05:14
Just like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:19:54
This is EXACTLY what I'm dealing with right now with my GF. I literally want to downsize my life, invest, Uber on my weekends, invest more and wait it out. All I hear from her is "Ugh, I hate the word Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:16:23
Well it's not considered income, right? It's considered property.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:24:01
Being the same company, why does one charge you more than the other?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:47
Actually, I've thought of that quote many times in my life and has usually been true. But the darkest night may be when it hits zero. lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:24:44
"The night is always darkest before the dawn" Exact quote that came to mind when I checked the prices this morning.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:39:48
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:56:35
I think people thought the same at 8k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:22:15
I bought in initially at 8k. I was drunk at a party and recklessly added $1000 @ $16.5k.

This hearing really boosted my confidence in Democracy, Capitalism and America. All of the arguments made were very reasonable and aimed at the protection of consumers. No suggestion of preventing the growth of this emerging resource which would be completely authoritarian.

Buddy, this is still early. Think about how complicated it is to understand, buy and transfer crypto. Someone is going to simplify this shit and it's going to take off. Remember the early days of Windows? You had to type in command messages in DOS to get anything going. That's what we're dealing with now. 
Also, eventually, not soon, brokers like Fidelity and TD Ameritrade are going to offer crypto services which will bring in floods of investors that didn't feel safe before. Pandora's box has been opened. There's no turning back. This technology makes processes cheaper, safer and faster. That will always win. We just need someone to make it easier. 
Don't listen to the Tulip people. You can't compare a fucking plant to blockchain. H.O.D. fuckin L.

Also, I just noticed a glitch. When I type in a stock to search and press search on the keyboard, it spaces instead of searching. Wasn't doing this earlier but maybe worth looking into.
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:22:46
Ahh, I miss those days. So good to see this meme again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:59:34
Beautiful App. Best one yet! My only suggestion would be to make it so you can swipe back between pages. I love apps where I can just swipe my finger across the screen to go back rather than reach for the back button on my iPhone 8plus.
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:38:53
Yeah, that doesn't always work that way.
