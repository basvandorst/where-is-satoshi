I wish p2sh didn't read a bit like phish.. just my weird brain I guess

sorry in this case, where would the fraud be committed do you think?

The model as far as I am aware is as follows: 
You are buying bitcoin at a higher price than you would elsewhere (don't ask me why people would, but I guess people that don't know where else to buy it) then essentially that price difference is funding your Amazon discount.
The discounts were reported to be high initially, but now 8% is considered achievable. I guess people have wised up in this past year to how to buy bitcoin and the options have genuinely improved. E.g. Circle, etc.
I've not actually used it ;-) but always intended to try it out some time :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:17:42
You can choose your own discount on Amazon using purse.io

for me it was Oculus Rift.. then of course I also stumbled on r/bitcoin :)
Reddit is my daily go-to site now. Just, great internet dude.
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:17:23
Most definitely big up those guys
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:51:09
I guess it depends on what they are trying to achieve. If they Hard fork and start mining there instead, then they might decide to gamble on their fork gaining economic momentum while BTC just dies. Haha, it's not working out for Cash that way, but then this isn't the massive hashpower exit I'm referring to.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:04:53
I understand the economics of mining, but these guys may have significant commercial backing. Enough to mine at a loss for as long as it takes to convince users there's only one viable path. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:06:41
But is the "entire ecosystem" determined by hash power or number of nodes? Cos that's pretty key. If it's hash power then those big miners are clearly the overwhelming majority. If it's number of nodes, then yeah, they're the (overwhelming) minority.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:50:15
Ah, but it's not 14 days max. It's usually 14 days when it's 10 mins per block. If hashing power falls significantly, then it will take proportionally longer to solve each block, so the 2016 blocks needed for difficulty adjustment could take months.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:43:14
Good statement and I agree. That said, the ticker means a lot. BTC is synanimous with "real" Bitcoin. If S2X gets hold of that ticker because exchanges decide to back it I think S2X would become the "real" Bitcoin. 
Quesion is, would exchanges do that? Well they would probably follow whatever the "ecosystem" felt was right so we come back to your statement.
Personally I can't see anyone going down the route of alotting "BTC" to anything other than the Core team's flavour of Bitcoin. Ethereum held on to ETH, but that's cos it was the core team that backed the fork. So it made sense. No, "BTC" and therefore "real" Bitcoin will always be whatever the Core team back. Even if a massive swathe of hashpower were to back S2X in November. They'll probably end up with BTX :)

I wasn't aware there were wallets like that for iOS, thanks a lot for the info
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:47:05
True, I didn't think of that. But stagnation is a problem right. If enough hash power drops out, Bitcoin stops working. That means big miners can hold the network ransom.
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:08:22
Would someone mind explaining what real world effect does this have on the node that gets disconnected?
So imagine I decide to run 0.15.0 and another node tries to connect to me, from what I understand, being on 0.15.0, my node will disconnect that other node (reject its connection). Surely this harms the other node somehow and to some extent the network as a whole.
I don't yet understand the comments saying that this will not disrupt the network.  
edit: typo
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:46:26
would you mind explaining the difference between updates that require forks/ consensus and those (like this one) that don't?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:16:07
sorry I don't understand what you mean. You said:
"...don't use bitcoin on PCs/laptop. Use a phone, here iPhone provides greater security..."
I said, there's no wallet for iPhone.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:53:50
Ok, I get what you're saying. As stated in another comment reply, I'm not talking about short term gain. A miner (or group of miners) with massive hashing power could gamble on their own hard fork gaining economic momentum while they allow BTC to die. So long term they would hope to win.
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:43:23
It kind of does, thanks, I can imagine these differences, but which type of change is the 0.15.0 change described here then?
I'm guessing it's the first type of change you mention. Seems to me that this effectively creates a backwards compatible soft fork. Because the more nodes that upgrade to 0.15.0, the more nodes that haven't yet upgraded are going to get rejected.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:13:29
Sure, we would have got activation on 1 Aug, but due to BIP-91 it activated earlier. Actually I no longer get the motivation behind BIP-91. What has it achieved? The only thing that made sense to me was that it was a S2X trick to get Segwit activated, but then big miners would stop signing for Segwit, allow the soft fork and get the main chain to stagnate, hoping users would get afraid, also stopping signing Segwit and then the non-Segwit chain would proceed (or something.. I read a nice conspiracy theory about this [here](
But none of that happened and we have Segwit indeed. BIP-91 achieved nothing. at. all. weird.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:23:29
I also think most big miners will not go ahead with S2X. They will bail. They KNOW that whatever happens, BTC is going to win in the long run. They can try to fuck things over, they can try to take control, but it's just not going to happen. Their fork will be worthless. People will take their new free coins and buy BTC again, just as they did with BCH. 
I love this stuff and I love knowing that Bitcoin cannot be tampered with. It's refreshing and actually a beautiful thing.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:48:12
I clicked it. It's more or less what I expected, i.e. a message saying it's 2.63X more profitable to mine BTC :D
But I don't see how this relates to my post.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:00:24
There are no offline iPhone wallets (that I know of)
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:24:34
S2X is dead in the water. Accept it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:54:50
really?! how?
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:33:49
By dead in the water I mean it's going the same way as BCH. Just another alt that'll be good for day trading and possibly some niche... But relative to BTC.. sorry folks, dead.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:42:24
Good I guess for Bitcoin. In that it shows that criminal activity can be thwarted by blacklisting addresses. Kinda defeats the openness of it all though i guess also.

Well strictly speaking it's not UASF alone. BIP91 caused Segwit to be activated before 1 Aug. Support for UASF was massive though, so once activated, lock-in was basically certain.
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:38:53
Recent events show it's necessary surely? If big miners stop mining, Bitcoin is screwed. The only way to escape would be ..to hard fork with updated software that altered the difficulty adjustment algo. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:37:13
I'm talking about the "original" chain. That's why I said "core". Cash is not core.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:09:50
Haha yeah good point

Oh you can scan the key in quite a few apps? Wasn't aware, thx
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:41:05
Sure, but yeah my use case was indeed for "friendly" interactions where the amount doesn't need to be exact and nobody really benefits from defrauding. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:59:34
Nope not mine
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:39:47
I'm thinking more along the lines of using it for tips or situations where the exact amount isn't so important.
My use case was asking someone for a cigarette and having something lke this to offer in return ;)
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:46:57
Sure but the use case is for "friendly" transactions where there's little benefit to defrauding someone. Like you wouldn't slip someone a foreign coin when tipping them :-)
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:47:38
Ha! I just found this. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 20:03:18
Yeah but the only proof of work making that baby go up in value is the steam coming off the press as they print that shit :-)

Bitcoin price is always turbulent. There's never a bad time to buy bitcoin. The main rule is: once you have bought it hang on to it. Bitcoin is not for quick wins, unless you plan to watch the market constantly.

works for me right now, based in Netherlands using mobile Safari iOS 7 over 3G (I.e. not a wifi hotspot that feeds traffic through another country, like the train Wifi sometimes does).

"What is important is that ownership of the rai is clear to everyone, not that the rai is physically transferred or even physically accessible to either party in the transfer."

ITT people without a sense of humour and people tossing around comments without actually explaining anything 
edit: why don't you try explaining something rather than moan about what people don't understand, it adds more value.
edit2: if the hash power went down slowly enough to allow the difficulty to drop steadily without the network stagnating, and hash power continued to drop at that rate, then you would eventually be able to mine with GPUs again, simply because eventually the difficulty would make that possible. So there. (Edit spelling too ffs)
