Excuse me Sir,
  I  believe you mean the Sveriges Riksbank prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, which respected academic economists created in 1968 three years prior to the dollar moving off the gold standard.  This is the only "Nobel Prize" which is not actually a Nobel Prize.
Best Regards

This was shot with a .380 handgun at 5m with no bipod. It was an indoor range where the target is only held with 2 binder clips at the top, which causes the keyholing. I don't know who posted this on reddit.

I don't think anyone can say if centralized systems or individual custodianship has been better in terms of total funds lost.  I will say that most centralized system seem to create systemic issues, which in the context of irreplaceable crypto assets could bring down an entire ecosystem.

The Lattice1 allows permissions and pairings so that the device can be used to make automatic crypto payments.  The electricity payment is one use case of automatic real-time payments.

Given the history of centralized solutions, a.k.a Mt. Gox, Cryptsy, Bitfinex, Bitcoinica, Parity, NiceHash, and ... Although things seem to be getting better in terms of reliability of centralized parties, you obviously haven't been around long enough to have experience of when these things go wrong.  The only way to prevent losing crypto is taking responsibility and individual custodianship.

Let me know if you have any questions.  One other thing that may be of interest is that in a multi-sig wallet multiple entropy sources could be used for the different keys.  One could be a PUF, the other could be a BIP39 generated on the Lattice1 or elsewhere, and the 3rd could be a backup provider like BitGo.  Then the user is really mitigating their risk of flaws in any single tech implementation.

The signing device is one option, the other option is the trusted counter party.  With account permissions, the signing device could automatically provide a signature for smaller transaction values and require a physical pin for higher values.  It achieves that best of all worlds.
@_date: 2018-10-19 00:20:03
No one, not even you, has the private key.  The key is only manifested physically. PUFs are like electronic snowflakes. 
They are made through uncontrollable randomness in the manufacturing process.  They cannot be observed or reproduced and each one is unique.  The entropy in a PUF is used to create a signature, but the private key is never actually knowable outside of the device.  This is the most secure way to store a secret because even nation states are not able to derive a private key from a PUF on a secure microcontroller.  For anyone familiar with nuances of security a PUF is the best way to keep a secret.  
That being said, if a customer does not want to use the PUF, they can store a secret on a smart card that is generated from a BIP39 process similar to trezor.  This is less secure from a physical standpoint because an electron microscope could be used to read the secret from the microprocessor, just like it could be read off the trezor. 
Additionally, it means that a plaintext copy of the seed likely exists somewhere written on a piece of paper, which not only suffers from durability issues but can also be easily compromised.
In terms of backups, hierarchical multi-signature systems would be they way to "backup" PUF based accounts, because the cards themselves are "physically unclonable" so they cannot be individually backed up because they are impossible to read or reproduce.

There is no way to back up funds. You should think of phonons as cash or paper money.  Phonons, like cash, are physical entities that cannot be backed up.  If you lose cash, or it is damaged or destroyed, there is no recourse.  This means that most people limit the transaction size for which they use cash.  You can think of phonons the same way.  Maybe you are comfortable with a few hundred or a few thousands of dollars worth of assets in Phonon, but you would be somewhat foolish to keep your life savings there.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:38:48
This is similar to Satoshium in that it trusts smart cards for storing keys.  However, Satoshium required physically trading of the tokens. Phonons can be traded between smart cards over any network interface.

The Lattice1 provides a secure anti-tamper interface for generalized crypto currency use. Similar to a ledger, but with better security features, user interface, and extensible off-line storage via SafeCards.  The Phonon Network does not require people to have a Lattice1 just a smart card running Phonon code.  If a person is willing to trust a card reader and a Raspberry pi, they can absolutely use SafeCards and the Phonon Network. They are just susceptible to any security vulnerabilities the card reader and raspberry pi have.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:42:51
Correct, smart cards will wear out after about 100,000 writes.  Each card should be able to store around 400 Phonons.  Therefore, they will only work for up to \~40,000,000 Phonon transactions.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:48:42
Could be local, or could be remote.  They just need any form of network connection to form an encrypted channel.
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:15:20
There are multiple functions of the SafeCards, one is a secure copy of seeds for general crypto storage and use.  The other is for the Phonon network.  
You are able to choose to be able to make copy general backups of on-chain assets to one or more SafeCards. 
You are not able to make copies of the seed or any of the addresses associated with Phonon assets.  They exist like a paper note, and cannot be copied or backed-up. The PUF on the card which encrypts the keys associated with Phonon assets prevent physical duplication, while the software dis-allows exporting of keys.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:19:16
These are some interesting ideas.  The protocol for Phonon would be easily interoperable with a statechain federation model.  Specifically, the smart cards could handle a key which belongs to a multi-sig set which is enforced on-chain.  This would simply be a specific asset type from the perspective of the cards. Let me know if you would like to explore using Phonon with statechains.

SGX is an Intel product.  The secure enclave on the Ledger is a ST product which uses an ARM SecureCore SC000.  This is a hardware isolated secure enclave which has both software and hardware security features that general purpose MCUs do not have.  The only communication between the MCU and the enclave is a SPI bus.  If the SPI bus is limited to 4-byte packages, it is not possible to inject malicious code.

Also, it would be interesting to see what you would require for me if I lose.  It will materially demonstrate your level of confidence in the device.  If you are willing to do it if I post 1 BTC you believe that there is less than 1 in 100 chance of me succeeding.  If you do it for 10 BTC you think there is a around a 1 in 10 chance.  If you do it for nothing, save costs, you think there is a 0 percent chance of success.

If you Trezor folk are so confident in using generalized hardware for secure purposes, I would encourage you to put your money where your mouth is and send me a Trezor loaded with 100 BTC and post the public address.  Then when I pull the private keys I will tell you how I did it, before I reveal it to the public.
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:07:42
Glad you liked it!

So the full address is for Bitcoin transactions not Ethereum transactions. Have been in conversations with  and they are looking at upgrading the Ledger Ethereum Wallet app to address this issue . 
Once they do this, I would absolutely recommend the Ledger over the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:13:45
I guess you missed the point.  By using general purpose MCUs there is a huge attack surface, so I wouldn't need to crack you pin.  I would just need your device.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:40:17
I wouldn't do it with a passphrase, only a PIN.  Strong passphrases are basically impossible, but that has nothing to do with the security of the Trezor hardware. If you send me one with a only a PIN, that would be a test of the Trezor and we can discuss the other side of the bargin.  
Also, it would be interesting to know what percentage of users implement a passphrase. Furthermore, the implementation of a strong passphrase has other downfalls, similar to the recovery key, in terms of backing-up.

The fact they are the last digits are the checksum does not make it any harder to find the collision
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:29:42
I appreciate the positive feedback. Need to bring some reasoning to the "Fiat fanatics".
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:55:25
Having a passphrase which isn't written down is akin to not writing down the recovery phrase.  Even if you do write it down it should be stored in multiple locations, which gets you back to the issue of physical security.  If you don't write it down you are much more prone to loss of funds.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:36:43
If you have a strong password that is a different matter.

Never purported to have a undisclosed demonstrated vulnerability.  Just very confident that I can find a new one.  For me to put the work into "fixing" their product I would need an incentive.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:19:59
Well I will take that as a complement.  If we want Bitcoin to be adopted by the 99% of people on the planet that don't currently use it ("the know-nothings"), than we need some relatable feel good nonsense that they can understand.

ACH is what is used by most people when they receive a direct deposit.  Wikipedia explains it as follows: Automated Clearing House (ACH) is an electronic network for financial transactions in the United States. ACH processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches. ACH credit transfers include direct deposit, payroll and vendor payments.

Your bank spends $20 everytime they send you or replace a credit card.  I said we are starting at $50, but hope to get it lower.  Also, I business model is such that the electricity customers will get an agent for free.  Finally, we are ultimately willing to sell these at a loss because of the knock on network effects and business that they would generate moving forward.

The Grid+ units are part of a larger system and an electrical utility in deregulated markets called  Grid+ (gridplus.io).  Grid+ will allow consumers to buy wholesale electricity in real-time via their smart agent.  The seeding of Grid+ agent's in customers homes has many secondary benefits for distributed systems beyond providing cheaper electricity.  Therefore, the agents will be free to new Grid+ customers. Otherwise we will be selling them as near as possible to cost which we anticipate will start at around $50.

The idea here is not to be super precise with where blockchain may or may not fall in the stack.  The point is to draw an analogy that many more people can understand.  Also, blockchain is encompassing of many different implementations which are in a battle to become the one or two dominate emergent standards.  This is currently being won by both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Furthermore, I would argue that Bitcoin will reach a point were there is little change to it after this year.  It will than become much like the TCP/IP standard which developed in the early years but remained largely unchanged for the past 20.
