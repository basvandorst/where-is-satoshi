More discussion here: 
Breaking: The Blockchain has Forked
Developers are currently holding an emergency discussion in  to determine a way forward.
The gist of the problem is that 0.7 and 0.8 clients have diverged with each building a different blockchain because 0.7 clients did not accept 0.8 blocks from a certain point.
The problem was likely caused by large blocks being rejected by miners running the 0.7 client.
At this point mining pools, merchants, and exchanges are considering taking themselves offline until a way forward is agreed upon. As a result, you may see that your transactions are slow to confirm, though that might be a moot point if the blockchain is rolled back.
This is a dark day for Bitcoin. Implications for the exchange rate will likely be huge... should Bitcoins be sold off prior to the exchanges going offline.
Update: Mt.Gox has temporarily suspended all deposits.
Update 2: The exchange rate has dropped 10% in the last 10 minutes, now $44/Bitcoin.
Update 3: Gavin Andresen has sent out an emergency alert: "URGENT: chain fork, stop mining on version 0.8"
Update 4: It appears as though the solution is going to be to encourage miners to revert to mining on version 0.7 until THAT blockchain is longer than the 0.8 chain, which would then make it the master blockchain.
Update 5: As the miners have taken their machines offline, the rate of block confirmation has dropped substantially. Only one block has been confirmed in the last hour, and even then, the transaction volume on that block was only 25 Bitcoins. It appears that the mining pools are taking coordinated action to address the issue in a timely manner, as they switch over to Bitcoin v0.7.
0143 GMT: Update 6: The v0.7 blockchain is currently 225436 blocks in length, while the v0.8 blockchain is 225446 blocks in length. Until 0.7 is longer than 0.8, the problem will persist.
0148 GMT: Update 7: This was the original announcement of the problem.
0151 GMT: Update 8: From Pieter Wuille, a great explanation of the cause of the fork:
0.7 and older nodes use BDB for storing the blockchain databases. It seems this database has a limit on the size of the modification it can make atomically to the database. With the larger blocks of the past days, it seems to have triggered the limit. The result is that 0.7 (by default, it can be tweaked manually) will not accept "too large" blocks (we don't yet know what exactly causes it, but it is very likely caused by many transactions in the block). Specifically, block 
000000000000015c50b165fcdd33556f8b44800c5298943ac70b112df480c023 (height=225430) with &gt;1700 transactions.
However. 0.8 (which uses a different database system) has no such limit, and happily accepts the block. As the majority of the hash power was on 0.8, the longest chain ended up using this block, which is not accepted by older nodes.
The solution is to (for now) go back to the old chain, which has block 00000000000001c108384350f74090433e7fcf79a606b8e797f065b130575932 at height 225430.
Hello everyone,
Í've just seen many reports of 0.7 nodes getting stuck around block 225430,
due to running out of lock entries in the BDB database. 0.8 nodes do not
seem to have a problem.
In any case, if you do not have this block:
  2013-03-12 00:00:10 SetBestChain: new
 height=225439  work=853779625563004076992  tx=14269257  date=2013-03-11
you're likely stuck. Check debug.log and db.log (look for 'Lock table is
out of available lock entries').
If this is a widespread problem, it is an emergency. We risk having
(several) forked chains with smaller blocks, which are accepted by 0.7
nodes. Can people contact pool operators to see which fork they are on?
Blockexplorer and blockchain.info seem to be stuck as well.
Immediate solution is upgrading to 0.8, or manually setting the number of
lock objects higher in your database. I'll follow up with more concrete
If you're unsure, please stop processing transactions.

The .7 version has a limitation on it that the .8 version does not. I think it has to do with block size, im not 100% on this. Either way: .8 users are allowed to mine blocks that .7 users dont have access to. Instead, the .7 uses started mining and a different block creating a 'split' in the Bitcoin timeline. They're telling people to go back to .7 and use that as the 'real' timeline.

Turns out the m makes it micro (maybe common knowledge but news to me) and much less attractive.

0.7 and older nodes use BDB for storing the blockchain databases. It seems this database has a limit on the size of the modification it can make atomically to the database. With the larger blocks of the past days, it seems to have triggered the limit. The result is that 0.7 (by default, it can be tweaked manually) will not accept "too large" blocks (we don't yet know what exactly causes it, but it is very likely caused by many transactions in the block). Specifically, block 
000000000000015c50b165fcdd33556f8b44800c5298943ac70b112df480c023 (height=225430) with &gt;1700 transactions.
However. 0.8 (which uses a different database system) has no such limit, and happily accepts the block. As the majority of the hash power was on 0.8, the longest chain ended up using this block, which is not accepted by older nodes.
The solution is to (for now) go back to the old chain, which has block 00000000000001c108384350f74090433e7fcf79a606b8e797f065b130575932 at height 225430.
Hello everyone,
Í've just seen many reports of 0.7 nodes getting stuck around block 225430,
due to running out of lock entries in the BDB database. 0.8 nodes do not
seem to have a problem.
In any case, if you do not have this block:
  2013-03-12 00:00:10 SetBestChain: new
 height=225439  work=853779625563004076992  tx=14269257  date=2013-03-11
you're likely stuck. Check debug.log and db.log (look for 'Lock table is
out of available lock entries').
If this is a widespread problem, it is an emergency. We risk having
(several) forked chains with smaller blocks, which are accepted by 0.7
nodes. Can people contact pool operators to see which fork they are on?
Blockexplorer and blockchain.info seem to be stuck as well.
Immediate solution is upgrading to 0.8, or manually setting the number of
lock objects higher in your database. I'll follow up with more concrete
If you're unsure, please stop processing transactions.

Make sure to spread the word to all miners!

So it's a casino? I can't just get BTC for playing?

Thanks for response!

"Vires in Numeris" = "Strength in Numbers" is appealing the most to me. It is simple and works on more than one level at the same time.

See main discussion here:
Breaking: The Blockchain has Forked
Developers are currently holding an emergency discussion in  to determine a way forward.
The gist of the problem is that 0.7 and 0.8 clients have diverged with each building a different blockchain because 0.7 clients did not accept 0.8 blocks from a certain point.
The problem was likely caused by large blocks being rejected by miners running the 0.7 client.
At this point mining pools, merchants, and exchanges are considering taking themselves offline until a way forward is agreed upon. As a result, you may see that your transactions are slow to confirm, though that might be a moot point if the blockchain is rolled back.
This is a dark day for Bitcoin. Implications for the exchange rate will likely be huge... should Bitcoins be sold off prior to the exchanges going offline.
Update: Mt.Gox has temporarily suspended all deposits.
Update 2: The exchange rate has dropped 10% in the last 10 minutes, now $44/Bitcoin.
Update 3: Gavin Andresen has sent out an emergency alert: "URGENT: chain fork, stop mining on version 0.8"
Update 4: It appears as though the solution is going to be to encourage miners to revert to mining on version 0.7 until THAT blockchain is longer than the 0.8 chain, which would then make it the master blockchain.

Awesome, thank you.
