So what is being decentralised by bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:37:23
So true...I would like to learn a lot from this guy today...I will do my best to learn the best out of him (as my Japanese friends would say)
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:07:55
If Bitcoin is decentralising transactions (such as my friend sending me a few $), and I can also do the same p2p transaction with a merchant, why are you claiming that BTC can not be used in day to day financial interaction? It's happening now!!!
Of course, it is slow but users already know this and they accept it. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 12:56:27

Exchanges get hacked
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:01:23


Well, to be fair you don't go through these steps all the time. The registration is only once (so is downloading bisq and registration); with coinbase, subsequent purchases are as simple as clicking on a button and get your coin. With Bisq, you need to find a suitable payment method every time and wait for arbitrage. So, yes Bisq is cumbersome even though it is what most users should use.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:59:07


I would like to know more about this...Shouldn't we remember that Bitcoin price is usually different from exchanges to exchanges? How different is tether, in this case?
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:17:45

It seems like you don't understand Bitcoin market. Don't worry to much: what you are thinking happen in almost all unregulated markets; that's what I came to understand.
However, what is important is the software side of things. If bots were able to create Bitcoin out of thin air (I am not talking about mining) as suggested by a recent cnbc article, then you should be worried. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:59:07

I have noticed this trading pattern a couple of weeks ago but I didn't think about it that much. Bitcoin's price is under some sort of influence, a force...I don't know where will end up

Hey, is there a link to further reading on this claim here? Just want to get familiar 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:46:00
That's what the author is missing. Bitcoin is entering a new territory, in which people now have more choice in what to buy....New entrants are not buying Bitcoin as it used be; they are buying alts. There are also some serious coins competing with Bitcoin now: Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Eth.....So very unlikely the scenario described will materialize within the timeframe mentioned. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:54:40
Do you guys know if there is another instrument similar to Tether? If it was that easy, why is this not replicated by another company?

You guys are just a bunch of amateurs....Do you even know anything about finance?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:19:42
Ok...Let's just relax....No price movement is expected...Maybe a little due to the situation in Japan..
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:42:18
Why are you saying this? People send me message all the time asking if I want to sell...because they are tired of dealing with fees and exchanges. So yes, I think it is possible that a small exchange might ask for something like this...
Obviously he has little to worried because the coins are not on the exchange anymore..

Lot of people are discounting such issues nowadays, but these are one of the biggest issues people should start working on. My response is once you start receiving more than 100k in increment within a year, you will be subject to Compliance review (at least that's my experience in a Small bank in Canada; not sure about the US but it can be even lower than the amount above). 
One solution is to use a couple of accounts and not go above 10k transfer a month. 
I am sure you are going tax, right? Do your best..

They have their heads in the sand for now. But decentralized exchanges are evolving slowly...
No one should actually use these exchanges because of the AML/KYC stuffs
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:07:30
Actually it should be like stocks for new companies, companies that will make real things but have investors across the world with low barrier of entry...
But of course, you see what we are into today. Companies without any clear plan on "paper" but valued in billion... 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:52:00
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:17:33
Holy-cow, nooo!~~But I see what you mean...~~ Actually No. You think decreasing the block size will increase the price? Fees discourage people from moving coins but I wouldn't care if I am selling or exchanging to alt. Bitcoin price is supposed to increase by adoption, not by reducing the block size. For adoption to happen more people needs to come in and buy small amount, but when they are hit by high fees, they won't buy it, or do buy it but exchange it to alt coins as it is happening now (even though the fees are kind of low). Your idea is completely wrong.
What we should do instead is to find ways to accelerate development and solutions, reduce inner-fighting, and encouraging learning....
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:51:15
TLDR: Actually, they report a lot about bitcoin...

I wouldn't feel like that...Believe me, even if you had bought long time ago, would you still have it? Are you sure you couldn't be persuaded to sell at one of those ATH? And then find out a week later that it has become even more expensive to buy?
At least this is my experience. I kept playing the Buy and Sell game...which was not very smart, even though I have been around for some time. Anyway...

Why do you need Andreas to tell you how you should diversity?
But I understand you, I am all BTC  now but sometimes I wonder why I am not also getting those 100% return. One thing is sure, a couple of months ago, when I was holding a lot of altcoins, they were bleeding while Bitcoin was going up like crazy. I was stuck and I couldn't sell...So you never know what is on the other side, honestly
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:44
Yes, I understand and no worries there are so many things to learn about in crypto world...If you want to see it as an investment, like huge in the future, there is a change...But of course you shouldn't listen to someone like me over the internet...
Some people have estimations floating around the internet. If you are good in stat, you can try or even build your own model (plenty of data are available from exchanges)

No, Businesses will transact in Bitcoin; States will take tax payment in Bitcoin and that's it. They can adapt anytime, but the sooner the better for you because Bitcoin is not like a natural resources. It flows to wherever there is demand, and you will pay the "fair" price for it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:50:41
In addition to the fee, the premium on the price is even crazier (for most ATM around here in Canada)
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:27:01
I think you are putting everyone in the same basket. Some poeple want to make money, some other people wants to create, to make things better, things that matter...

Ahh, so nice...Not sure if people are getting it
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:50:49
The fee estimation depends on the size (pretty complicated at this moment), but I can't think of an easy way of estimating it now.

If you were in Afghanistan today, you would know how useful Bitcoin is...just one example and there are more.

@_date: 2017-12-04 01:26:32
I am not bothered because I didn't take the same risk as they did. They believed it before me, so they bought more of it; Now that I believe it, I buy whatever I can.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:11:08
Yes, you are right! Pump it
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:19:03


You are not...I saw some of your posts in the past
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:31:13


big problems...The interest rate is high because of the risk. But imagine if you were asked to lend 7 million to someone, you will be worried. But what if we could collect $1 from 7 million people to lend to someone, your risk level will be way low, and you might ask for little to no interest at all..which will reduce the burden on the borrower.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:02:40

You sound like someone straight from r/bcash, but I will give the benefit of the doubt :). First, I am not from there, but I was I wouldn't mind paying $15 to send 15 million to my brother in Sidney. 
Probably, I was from there, I wouldn't mind paying another $15 to have bitcoin instead of carrying bags of money (so I don't get robbed by the bandits along a trade route).
Basically, people who use Bitcoin today knows the trade-off. They also know this is a nascent technology, that will evolve. I am not sure if you have seen how internet speed has evolved as better solutions are found...
But if you are from the bcash group, please just go buy more bitcoin cash...Cool?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:04:21
Very nice design
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:14:41
Why do you think most people are here to make money? Some of the people who had bitcoin in 2010 could have sold everything when the price went beyond expectation, or when it fell so many times. But they still hold it, in part as a way to free themselves from some sort of entanglement. 
Before Bitcoin, there were ideology and believe that the society needs something that is not controlled by states because they realized the influence of banks around the world, which influence global politics.

Encryption is a two way function means that if you get "xxxxxx" after hashing a transaction 1234, you can also reverse-hash 1234 to get "xxxxxx". 
Bitcoin doesn't use that, it uses Sha to mash transactions together so the node can verify them.

ATM fees are crazy at this moment, in addition to the premium they charge. But we also need to use those machine as we need them in this new chapter.
ATM will ask for address, but seriously send it to your own wallet (unless you want to trade). Download a good wallet and use that for now, until you become confortable

@_date: 2018-05-24 07:36:15
I can't believe this is even posted on a credible website...Such as stupid guy
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:11:25
Post this on r/Canada bitcoin page...You will get better information there how to cash out...DO NOT USE QuadrigaCX as some people are mentioning here....You might never get your money...
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:43:00
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:35:24
LOL, yeah right!
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:09:54
Noo, he will not get his money...maybe after 5 months....
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:40:39
I purchased some with Cex and not only they charged me a huge premium, but my bank (TD) also charged me the inevitable cash advances.. Never again
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:26:01
Please help me understand this and its implication:
When I go to the store, a pack of gum is priced at $2. The same night I see that the $ has lost 5% of its value, but the price of the gum is still $2. That is why it's called unit of account.
However for Bitcoin, which I don't think should be qualified as "UofA" because anything priced in BTC is subject to fluctuation. 
Would you mind helping me understand why some people still consider BTC as "UofA?
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:19:26
Of course they will, if you are stupid enough to fall for it.
Save your PK!
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:23:42
To be honest, why is that Andreas  Antonopoulos is not on the list...I feel ashamed every time I look at his twitter profile background image and not see a single African country.
Yet he keeps saying that Bitcoin is actually for the "other 2 billions" people.
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:14:33
You know what is interesting in this article? In the comment section, a 68 years  old with "electrical engineer degree and have used computers since the 1960s" asking how to get bitcoin! 
That is fascinating :)))

Yes, we have a meetup group: try Bitcoin Bay. Otherwise let me know your questions
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:45:07
Good job guys! Now once you start incorporating Mobile Money into this, that is...You will take over!
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:17:38
Your question reminds me to Andreas' point: TROLL
I was looking at some of posts on reddit, just in case you are wondering.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:13:11
thanks for reminding us
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:14:38
Not that I agree with whatever he says, but I actually believe we should find more use cases for even more price increase. I don't want to be just looking at bitcoin in my wallets
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:21:45
I don't understand...Hasn't he said yesterday that it was approved?
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:08:35
Check this link: there is a page about "Fedcoin". That might help a bit: 
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:06:29
The 33% is little bit high, but there is a huge penetration in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and some North African Countries. Look at Tunisia, they are even talking about changing their currency to bitcoin...
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:38:59
Nothing will happen because of the Australian Gov sale. BTC will be flat until halving....

Nice; My buddy is moving to Taiwan and I gave him $5 BTC , so I am glad about this
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:15:06
Got it. They took it down sometimes ago (even though we go there once a month to hold meetup and buy drinks and foods with our fiat. I really wish more business were accepting btc.
@_date: 2016-06-16 10:48:21
Now, you are lying. This place doesn't have any machine (anymore). In fact, we hold Bitcoin meetup there and they don't accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:26:03
What is funny is that there almost no way of spending it (in Toronto)
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:41:54
As long as exchanges keep offering huge margin trades, these guys will continue to seek rents...
This is actually a serious issue for anyone who is planning to hold
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:17:22
Can you explain this purchase a bit more? How did it happen?
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:13:38
It is of detriment to the bitcoin network. Because of the fact that any big player can quickly double its asset by creating a new coin. Do you think about how much Roger is going to have when BCC goes even higher? Of course, users will ultimately give consideration to the most useful coin; but remember that ICOs are selling even-though some of them barely have a functioning website. Powerful players creating new coins can be a bad thing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:33:25
This is exactly what I was saying yesterday. Those transaction fees have to be watched. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:52:54
Me too!!! 
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:56:56
Actually this response is dated 2015. I am sure lot of things have changed in China, so the above argument should be taken with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:06:14
I think it is a lot: 24,000 BTC. That's a lot
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:08:44
I see. So as long as the Difficulty Level is low on BCC, transaction fee might stay high on BTC? Is there a specific time for BTC DL to be low? 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:07:48
Bitcoin has a bigger problem, so the question should have been: "....if I always have to deal with these fluctuations?"
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:48:27
Ahahahah, exactly....Everyone can do this, but the question where are the coins now?
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:07:29
Me? Very bearish about bitcoin and its future...As french speakers like to say " Bitcoin is a giant with feet of clay" lol
Can't wait for it to rise again so I can exit
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:18:28
Fees: please pay attention to fees (purchase, miner fees, price premium on some exchanges....)
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:46:41
I love the idea! This is fantastic for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-25 11:31:44
I have the same mindset also now. Bitcoin has a lot of issues
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:46:58
I just heard god speaking ;)
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:22:55
A coin is not accepted everyone! What about people without debit card who would like to spend their coin?
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:14:59
Very easy: doesn't Bitcoin already have reputation issue? What if you have some traders manipulating the whole pricing, with no oversight? I am sure the last thing we want now newspapers coming up with price manipulation articles...
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:53:13
A website or a link on how to do set up
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:03:18
Wow, thank you for that. I couldn't find any of these when my friend asked me where to spend
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:34:51
I am now taking these wild drop very seriously. It says a lot about Bitcoin and its future!
@_date: 2016-06-04 15:45:36
Do you know any company issuing those cards in Canada? The fees, for example with Xapo, are a big turn off...
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:05:42
Wow! I feel your pain; good luck
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:19:42
You are so right; 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:16:08
I realized the same conclusion. Thanks for the blog
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:12:03
Do you know any other resource to implement this?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:05:16
Is it fair to say that Roger supported the fork in order to double its bitcoin? Works like this: 
1. You have a bunch of bitcoin; 
2. You push people to get a fork, and you get the same quantity of the newly created coin
3. People buy your new coin; and the price increases and you become twice richer!
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:52:07
Does this have anything to do with Segwit? I bet yeahh :(
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:13:30
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:13:05
If you are not in rush and don't mind the high fees, you should check ATM.
Otherwise, go with QuadrigaCX. I tried my credit card on CEX {I WILL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN}
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:34:40
Wow; Cool stuff. I didn't know that Satoshipay was actually live
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:47:37
This is great! Multiples countries in Africa are in desperate need of bitcoin exchanges. The demand is very high.
Good luck
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:56:13
Honestly, I am always happy to see bitcoin ATMs but I hate using them. The fees are too high for these transactions (the same goes for buying BTC with credit card: Do not do this!!!)
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:01:27
So hard...If US bans Bitcoin, new currencies will be created and the values will be transferred to those...
Bitcoin can be like those banned substances; someone will change an ingredient and boom..you have a new fresh product (before the gov can ban that also). No way of winning this...
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:50:57
Thank you! 
FYI: I have a great knowledge of Bitcoin and the technology. Took some of the best courses, met some of the most prominent speakers, I even do some programming...So yes, I kind of know what I am talking about and I didn't buy to make a quick buck
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:40:57
Good. I will be selling for sure at 5500....I don't even know why I am waiting for that....Should do once I connect from home internet....Bitcoin is done, trust me!

No, it will not be frozen. Who cares where you got it?

 I will reach to Alakanani via twitter today and see what we can do.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:37:27
Anyone who has been following Bitcoin in the last two years will most likely not have any interest in buying it, even in the future....Bitcoin has become a laughing stock!!!! Get real

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:48
Thanks. I will watch
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:30:04
Don't worry! Changes or fork that are legimate usually start from the users, like yourself. 
Also note that the few miners in China are not alone in mining bitcoin and keeping the records. If they refuse today to mine bitcoin, the difficulty level will change in a couple of days and you, as a simple user, will be able to mine again. Bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:31:15

Amazing. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:44:16
Not me, probably anyone who is actually interested in Bitcoin. Most of us took serious time to know about it, to know how to protect our little money (of course, I can still be hacked tomorrow), but for you to ask where to get "my key" from coinbase says a lot about your experience. Relax and learn first!
Anyway, that was just my humble advice. I hope you get that "key" from coinbase quickly
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:55:12
Since you are as lazy as I am, here is the definition for you:
 
A computer scientist is a scientist who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.
Since you are such an idiot, should I also give you some names?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:13
Snitching....Honestly, you can get bitcoin in a lot of places without KYC...and that's what it is supposed to be
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:27:05
You open an account on Quadrigax and send BTC there; Sell and either EFT or e-mail transfer for a fee
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:29:01
Because we believe in it; we have scientists from all sort of fields working, FOR FREE, on it everyday to make it better, secure....That's why
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:09:29
That's all you got? I am done here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:37

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:37:13
Aha, they have been under a lot of sanctions; so the lessons were learned to get away from the international flow of money. With rising tension now between Iran, Israel, and Saudia, a smart government would definitive find another way to keep money flowing to avoid past errors.

Western Union still doesn't know what is going to happen...In most places today in Africa today, no one use them to transfer money between themselves. Almost everyone can buy, send, receive money using their cellphone.
The only thing remaining for Western Union is Remittance from abroad. Last week I paid $10 to send $100 to my brother using Moneygram. The next day, I saw that my bank started offering the same service to 35 countries for free (though my country is not in that lest yet).
These guys are facing decimation! There is no way to compete with Blockchain technology! 
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:50:34
At this moment, more than 20 millions people use a "Mobile Money" to send money, pay for bills, buy things....In Ivory Cost only, 10 Millions Euro are exchanged daily using "Mobile Money". By the time Bitcoin become widespread in Africa, Remittances will be just a small portion of bitcoin usage. Africans are bypassing the traditional banking, and since there is a huge increase in user of "Mobile Money", increasing at 40%, Bitcoin will feel at home there.

Only the TRUE BELIEVERS win in crypto! I have made the same move, specially after reaching 1000. I remember one day me telling my boss how I made $200 per bitcoin in a matter of weeks. So I was so happy to sell around 1200...Since then I never had enough to match what I used to have....
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:00:39
Very weird indeed
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:04:46


When did you do that? I had a long standing EFT, and had to cancel it
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:49:15
ahahah!!!!! BTC will drive all of us nut!
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:09:21
It is time to tumble here and there
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:07:54
Exactly...I also feel like Quadrigax is sending some people on these forums to try to calm people down (like, saying that a few EFT were cleared after 5 days....).
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:56:46
Even though I am not in Venezuela, I do take bitcoin for web projects. Let me know guys
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:51:45
Yes! That's very productive...
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:55:15
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:23:28
Look at you idiot...Why don't focus on things that matter...Avoiding real stuffs like a little chicken
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:17:05
Listen, you are not a crypto go...So please have a seat, otherwise tell me the price of bitcoin at 9AM eastern tomorrow (I feel you like scams but I will not mind sending you some coins).

Thanks for supporting the network!
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:02:40
transactions fees are super low nowadays, but if you buy just a pack of gum you might end up paying more 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:58:20
The last paragraph is all that is important to me! When I was in Namibia, I did not see a single presence of bitcoin there; Of course that doesn't mean there is no user. If those users know more about bitcoin, they can definitely trade without government scrutiny. Or they can just cross the border to Cape town to transact...Easy

Who said it was about skin color? The poster saw it at a particular location and she mentioned that...
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:27:15
Yeah, you should say where he is...Maybe someone can help you
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:02:53
They will push the price up, but no other effect on the network itself. The asset manager will be no different from regular person in that case. Unless if they start mining
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:40:35
Indian ladies should specialized in Journalism....They go deepp and l love it.
Thanks for putting these officials on a hot seat. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:07:18
I guess Segwit was just a noise...No?
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:59:25
Yeah? which exchange?
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:45:47
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:39:13
What is IRS?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:16:22
I have been experiencing the same for a while. I stopped trying
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:26:43
Same question here...I like Bitcoin, but boy....
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:26:08
Well, what if that third party is a good getaway to fiat? I think we are all forgetting that banks will be needed for a while in crypto world.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:20:50
If I sell, the market will go up like crazy. So I am holding to punish every single hodler in the world :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:42:45
I love the story and the website; count on me!
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:54:56
Nice :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:49:15
ahahah!!!!! BTC will drive all of us nut!
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:23:38
Yeah? Why?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:16:03
Well, you haven't been following the news right? Sometimes I imagine if Bitcoin was a bank with an actual CEO, how would she speak to clients after so many attacks?
- First were the introduction of futures and the attacks from economists saying that Bitcoin will die this time
- The transaction fee attack
- The scandal in South Korea
- The incredible article stating that Bitcoin is susceptible of price manipulation by bots that could create Bitcoin out of thin air
- Future settlements FUD
- Exchange hack in Japan bigger than Mt Gox
- Tether
But we are still at it. Honestly I am surprised this time and don't know what is going to happen...Simple as that...
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:29:26
You are not alone with such question, but you already know the answer: nobody knows.
For me, I feel so dumb, because I bought a bots to trade altcoin at .1 btc and when I connected it to the exchange, it spent almost all my small bitcoin to buy altcoin. It barely made any profit. Now I am kicking myself about what to do. Should I sale those shitcoin in the negative to return to bitcoin or wait for bitcoin to drop so I can sell them. 
At least your cash is not losing value as those shitcoins that I have...well, probably not if you consider your currency as a shitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:21:23
"Arguably" the best, until when you tried to withdraw you fund (not currency withdrawal). If you visit r/bitcoincanada you will see how people have been complaining about their funds being stuck for months, and the only response from Quadrigax is automated emails whenever you submit a ticket about it. 
Some people might tell you that they can withdraw in a blink of an eyes, but I know more than that
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:14:57
Nice work
Not sure about the color scheme though
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:38:26
How do you know that?
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:22:04
good stuff!
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:54:35
What? Is this a joke?
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:26:45
Awesome news; Luno has an ambitious plan of reaching clients across Africa. Luv it
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:15:10
No Andreas, I am not going to do that....
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:58:33
When banks buy mutual funds for their clients, we still say that so and so bank bought this mutual funds. We don't see the end client, so the same idea is being applied to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:52:13
Thanks for supporting the network!
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:16:38
Of course Bitcoin needs to be defended once a while. What if there is possibility to convince these guys so banks can relax rules around fiat/btc transaction?
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:42:57
I think you will need to download again
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:19:46
But, does volatility depend on the number of users? 
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:16:51
Frustration makes you blind...Where were you when it was at 6k two weeks ago?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:54:56
Nice :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:30:46
Ouch lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:33:15
lol. Are you a journalist?
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:13:04
Ahahahahahahaha, you just killed me
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:30:11
According to people in the "other" sub, this decrease is due to Bitcoin transactions in the mempool. Thought?
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:49:13
I agree; Bitcoin should already have a better privacy feature. I think someone is working on a solution, but can't remember the details.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:59:16
No way
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:31:13


@_date: 2017-10-12 15:16:28
the bots will push the price on non-existing order?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:44:48
Ahaha, I also sold some today; Now it's going up....WTF is this phenomenon? lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:04:11
But the boss hasn't completely made up his mind yet, right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:34:39
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:19:24
How do you make 6 figs bro? Finance? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 01:09:18
Wow, some of the questions here show that I have been in this space for long time....
I mean who doesn't know these stories aahahah! Sorry guys, I had to write this
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:20:23
Ok, so give a bracket for tomorrow price at 85% certainty, you pageant Egyptian god!
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:46:51
You should not have more than 1 bitcoin on Mycelium wallet (at least that's what I do). If you have more, get a cold storage, something off line. Check other type of wallets
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:14:18
You must know more than this....Say it HODLER!!!
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:25:05
Guys, I have a question. I recently used Electron to get bitcoin cash, and I used my seed words to get it. Now I feel little insecure of using the same mycelium wallet with the same seeds. How can I change my seeds? Preferably the same wallet without downloading a new one
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:35:30
Oh j'adore bitcoin!!!! Oui Ouii
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:07:50
But what if you are selling, let say, $10,000? How will you settle with the other person? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:53:23
Miners deciding on fork is not enough; Users have a big say in this case.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:37:28
I am going through this same shit now. For me, it is even worse because I bought a bot just a couple of days ago at a crazy price. Now I lost almost a 1000 just in a couple of days.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:29:44
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:58:20

@_date: 2017-10-17 13:54:15
Honestly, no. The ideal use is for the holder to be able to use the coin himself in the future, on your platform. Remember, ICOs are not stocks so you pretty have no liability if you disappear all the sudden. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:34:38
Soon. Nothing is perpetual :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:27:23
Bitcoin gives a shit a China! We are done with that now
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:13:12
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:52:28
Ouch; I completely forgot that side
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:01:12


I have never seen anything like it...If you think about it, and look at the price of 9k we all should be proud of what Bitcoin can accomplish 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:48:31
Nice! Now it's time for me to be even more persuasive :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:32:11
Not really sure what is your goal here, but most Africans are not interested in Bitcoin. Hear me out!
Africans are pretty much set with Mobile money now, and once they see the similarity they don't bother learning anymore. 
When you talk about early adoption with redistribution of wealth, I am sure you know about the saving rate in Africa, without mentioning thinking that far into the future to a level that will redistribute wealth. 
Even if you tell them only about the ICO, cheaper altcoins...most people will still look at you like you are crazy. The effort is humongous. 
The fees on bitcoin alone will turn off a lot of people interested in this (of course at current level is what I mean).
So forget about Africans using bitcoin as a daily payment method for now. However, there will be a small group of people who would buy it and hold for long term.
What you can do is to look for other application: Cross borders payment settlement for business, Gathering statistics and pay with blockchain, Internet of thing with 21computers, land registration system with governments, things like that...
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:16:31
There is no way to have this ETF approved...You guys should hold your horses and sell BTC after this +30% profit. Think about such a profit, what else would you want? Don't be greedy guys
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:33:15
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:57:00
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:02:02
How does the pricing work? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:58:35
So, ILLEGALLY entering the US is not UNLAWFUL? I mean there is no victim...right?
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:04:39
If the lady of the poster was Japanese, I would have considered getting it ONE day....But too bad anyway
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:11:20
I like this argument, but would you mind elaborating?  (the 401k piece)
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:27:37
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:23:41
For 1 or 2. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:58:22
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:31:09
If you don't have anything left, withdral the remaining and open a new account quickly with like PC or another newer bank. 
They might contact you, but won't be able to do much. Once you have the money, go there and pay the fund asap (they will just clear the balance)
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:29:08
Definitely. And the reason is: Bitcoin is open source. But the question is: which chain are you going to follow?
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:34:04
I wonder the same, but I will check the white paper
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:31:30
Can you tell me a bit more about this bots?
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:21:26
If it's a huge amount, then it will eventually hit your credit (if you care about that ;). 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:18:35
Ditto....These guys are luna...No ETF will be approved, trust me!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:35:02
You should read about the Penal code of Jante; It goes like this:
"Perhaps you don't think we know a few things about you?"
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:27:53
Where will it be? I will give some bitcoin for your work (error margin of 10% acceptable)
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:30:52
Hey  let me know. I can help you set up a very good looking email.....Oh yeaa, I BTC ;)
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:38:45
I am in pain here, ok? lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:49:25


Proving delusion...
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:47:50
Very similar to what  is already doing. Good work
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:41:39
Yes...so pro that they became paranoid....Bitcoin is slowly dying while most of them are asking to HODL lollllll
Let's get real
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:11:22
Very happy with this....no mention of tether. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:02:55
Hackers who support Bitcoin should start hacking any database tracking users around the world....
@_date: 2016-07-08 18:30:54
Can anyone tell me what is so special about Philippine when it comes to remittance? 
Abbra: Only Philippine
Rebit: Only Philippine
What I can see if that all these companies are scared of going to the last miles in where remittances are going...Bitcoin hasn't been able to beat mobile banking (yet), which has been expanding considerably in those places
@_date: 2016-07-27 10:38:15
This is definitely possible and I have seen similar pricing here in Toronto also.
I never mention those places to people new to bitcoin because this is a huge rip off
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:16:19
Ahahahah! Only Satoshi himself can save the day...
@_date: 2016-07-08 18:24:58
Yea, there is
