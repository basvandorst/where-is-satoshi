I disagree. The media will never do that because they're owned by lobbies. They will never bite the hand that feeds them. As such, Decentralization of Media is one of the most important things to do in this modern age to completely dismantle what is equal to a Global propaganda problem. 
The rise of Independent Journalism is just one of the reasons these countries have started to seriously look into censorship, and we need means of not allowing them to achieve that goal of cutting off freedom of legitimate information just because it doesn't fit their narritive of the narritive of their donors.

Think about it this way. Media currently is heavily Centralized. Who controls it? Lobbies and donors with an Agenda that is viewed favorably by their respective media outlets. For example Jeff Bezos owns "The Washington Post", and it's seldom you'll ever seen differing views between the two. For this reason, there needs to be a solution to bringing Journalism into the hands of the people for the people. Not based on views, but based on hard factual and investigative sources brought in front of the people for a better dose of realism instead of favoritism.

That's as bullshit as the saying, "If you want Peace, prepare for War".
War only creates more war. Cryptocurrency gave birth to a Borderless money. It is the inception of a world without borders. A world where a new generation of International people's can peacefully co-exist better than we do now without the Governments constantly telling us who to hate, and conditioning to us who we should go to war with. The era of war should end, and an era of peace should be pursued relentlessly.

"Lack of resources", the ultimate myth. There is no lock of resources. I find this halarious anytime someone brings it up. Let me clarify though, most assets required for basic sustainability and enjoyable life are infinite.
The problem comes in Control. Centralization. Greed. If you want to influence a civilization, you take their resources and make them limited so they have to buy it or get it some other way. Perhaps for example let's takes farming. Food grows from land. How can there be such thing as world hunger if everyone had somewhere to grow food, for example in their yards. Or if food grew in nature just as before you could walk the countryside and find apple trees or something similar, yet, now you MUST go to a market to purchase it, the market is controlled, so is the farm, and so are the seeds in which farmers are regulated to use.
The point is, Centralization of humanity, is the cause of wars. When single men can send millions of their people to die in their name over things like Lust, Ego, or Greed (Napoleon Bonaparte), we have a series problem. Why have we let 1, 3, or a simple handful of men send millions of us to kill millions of others? 
I think now, In this century, the era is over. With the world more connected than ever before, with a Borderless Currency, I think it's finally come the time where the people of the world rule themselves.

That's not the only thing.

Anything they don't like will be heavily regulated, funny, considering these same five eyes spend 80% of tax payer money on "defense" to combat "opressive" states.

War got the U.S. out of the great depression, and it's no surprise they've been capitalizing on it ever since. It's no surprise anyone anti-war is thoroughly attacked, and why National Gaurd fired on protesters of the Vietnam War.
But the grip on the war economy has since evolved and anyone who goes against it are sanctioned by the dollar, which is why Crypto is so much more important now. If we can move away from an economy based on war, there's hope yet for the world. It's no surprise so many countries are selling U.S. debt and dropping the dollar in favor of alternatives. Soon, it will be the U.S. facing global sanctions rather than the U.S. imposing sanctions woth a global reach.

I think your looking at it the wrong way. Modern day institutions are designed to cause what is called financial slavery. In short, it's possible to enslave someone in debt, with debt traps. In other words It costs you more to be in debt, and there are a different set of rules for you, and the ones who rule over you, when it reality it's you who should be holding those you presumably put in charge accountable for shortcomings, debt mis-handling and jeopardizing economic stability.

People fail to realize Bitcoin was created because of the abuse of not just Fiat, but most specifically the United States Reserve Note. The people of the US cannot rein in their role as the federal reserve abuses power due to there being no checks and balances for them. As such, Bitcoin had to be developed and it's a real blessing.

Yes, information is required for complex societies, the notion of creating a better system where people can actively decide what about their information is accessible and what is not is just a refinement of the current system that is messy, unorganized and often manipulated.
Financial Wealth in the respect of removing the debt trap from the credit system.
Some forms of debt are reasonable, but most is not. The vast majority of the world is currently in debt, to the Central Banks due to the credit trap in the current inefficient system of fractional reserve banking.
Fixed it, thanks.
Also, it's never too early to politicize Bitcoin, as its core purpose of the system underlines the very need to completely overhaul if not replace the current. Bitcoin's inception in a sense, could be seen as entirely political, on a Global scale due to its nature.

That's understandable, but then you lost me at "Islam". I've actually had the ability to speak with many people of this faith. And actually all three of the main faiths. The thing with religion is that it's always been at conflict with Government. All three books, the Qur'an, Bible, and Torah, tell the same story. In modern society though upon speaking with some scholars, have proved to be that Religion has become hostage to Politics. For example, a person that says their a Muslim commits atrocities such as senseless killing, or taking of life not of direct self defense, is not a Muslim. The reality is the term and phrase Islam, has been hijacked for use of a political Agendas. It's not just Islam. Christianity has become the face of evil too in the west, while Judaism is also being used for political mesns at the expense of the Jewish community. In short, all religions have been up ended from their real meaning and have succumb to the false usage of their faiths. So the idea that Islam is the result of the siege of Europe, is not true. That would be the result of Ottoman politics. They have hijacked Islam, and as a result, it's destroying real Muslims everywhere.

It is a choice depending on the situation. You can be invaded by a force by a better equipped force, ready with the intent to make slaves of your people, boats and all. You don't have a say in this. But should you understand the result of that invasion, you can choose to fight for your freedom. I think knowing the history of both results, it's clear, despite being taken by surprise and forced into slavery, many didn't have a choice. You can *choose* only to fight against evil for so long before you are overrun, and eventually result in being colonized. As a result, every single nation except for one (don't you dare say Wakanda) on the African continent were colonized, and have since been subject go exploitation, even long after slavery, economic exploitation still remains.
Edit: I edited my post upon criticisms to the faults in my original argument backing the notion it was strictly a choice. It isnt.

Because the way the world works is this. Who ever controls the money, controls the people, which controls the world. Literally. So let's break it down.
Bitcoin is a peer to peer decentralized global currency not owned by anyone, and runs on Blockchain. The people who currently own and manipulate the money, are very angry they can't do anything about this. They understand that People owning the money, means the people of the world, control the world instead of just the government's few insider circles. This means no crazy profits from things like planned economic wars and debt based currency pegged to things like Oil which are their manor source of income at the expense of the security and stability of world peace. Literally.
TLDR; Current financial system is a leash and chain around the neck of Humanity. Bitcoin flips that switch, making the powerful powerless, and could eventually lead to their persecution via consensus understanding of the old system once people adopt bitcoin and wake up to what the old system has been doing for centuries.

I mean sure, granted you stand down and still refuse capture. You could still fight, or just refuse which would garner torture. So your not really becoming a slave, but the suffering you would receive would be just as bad. Though I should correct myself of the original post that Slavery has only evolved. It changed from an open and obvious disgusting and inhumane act to being more discrete and institutional. So it depends actually. You can't choose not to be a slave should you not be aware what it is to be a slave and what it is to be free. If you could be fooled into being a slave, you could essentially be selling yourseld and not know it because it becomes the norm. This is the problem, I see that now Slavery in the 21st century is much different because you don't know, and as a result now, you do not have a choice because you cannot fight or resist what you cannot see.

People should buy Bitcoin to change that balance of power into the hands of the people with international currency that cannot be sanctioned or taken from them by force.

But you can't reverse history, we know what being a slave means, and despite the ugliness of it all, it does make it *Mandatory*. It is a choice, and the result of possible dying to fight for your self preservation as a human being is indeed just as "insensitive" as the burdens of being enslaved. Grow up. This is real life, it's not all sparkles and sunshines.

Why get a load when things like crowd funding exist? Think about it in a decentralized consensus economy, where if you need money for somethinf you don't have, you have to get it based on trust in your product or what ever. The community that's interested in your product can fund you, and there's then not much need for loans anymore.
Though, you're right on the tone of Exchanges. I think a major fix for this is going to be something like Cardano's future Universal Wallet that uses side chain. So imagine ease of use, the ability to store Bitcoin on a wallet with your other assets instead of on an exchange. One of the blockers behind Wallets noe is the learning curve and ease of use/access. Once people get past that, it should considerably be more attractive to have self custody of your assets.

I think you've lost your mind. A nuke can turn a city to sand. It happened to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But remember, that was less powerful and not used in a fashion that would result in prolonged radioactive fallout. Over time nations have brought the world to the brink, no nation in particular bears blame, but all nations that possess such weapons are responsible, as well as those that fund it. At what point has any citizen ever willingly funded with their tax payer money the creation and use or possible use of such a weapon that would hold the world hostage and that's just a portion of the issue. Radioactive poisoning is irriversbale and incurable. The world is better off without it, and the funding for such things should end. We have good alternatives to Nuclear power that are cleaner and could be just was efficient with the funds used for nuclear research instead used for alternative clean energy. Things like solid state batteries and graphine/graphite microtechnologies could easily jump start (No pun intended) an Era of electronic self reliance without environmental risks posed by nuclear power and weaponry. It's also in unison with Crypto, because with solar panels you can live off of a grid, you can support your own costs with electricity and if you wanted, could connect to a grid comparing of other users to spread the power between each or donate excess power to maybe a mining facility or something.

Probably not, but it doesn't help that on top of apartheid, when it ends, there has to be a reconciliation effort if restoration to their dignity and humanity, otherwise chaos ensues.

Ok, he has issues. Bitcoin is internet money, period. It's sole purposes is peer to peer money backed by a secure Blockchain algorithm. That's not gonna replace goveenments, but it can bring about the revolution of changing governments and making them less corrupt if the masses use Bitcoin over Fiat currency. Why is this? Because Fiat is debt based, and centrally controlled. This means that if I'm a big country and I have influence in more central banks, I can siege other countries economically if they don't do what I say instesd of blowing them up. This causes major suffering for innocent people over there, but may benefit me since I don't have to spend money to go over there and physically make them do what I want. Bitcoin comes in and says fuck that, no one has control over what I do, and thus becomes a medium for people to manage their own wealth out of the control of those who have been using wealth to manipulate, blackmail, and exploit certain loopholes in the existing system. Now they have to either adapt to the new International currency, or find a way to stop it. It also serves as a way to revert the world from the Petro Dollar, which has been the cause of millions of deaths, hundreds of millions of displaced persons and refugees, and has brought the world to the brink of destruction, once during the Cuban missile crisis, and most recently with Iran and North Korea. The idea that the system we have works, and that the hope of Bitcoin replacing what we have is a "conspiracy theory" backed by lunatics is an extremely misguided opinion. 
The reality is people all around the world are absolutely done with what we have because no one wants to live in a Post Apocalyptic future where you have to live your life avoiding Nuclear ground zeros from a war caused by egos of old men who control a disproportionate amount of the world's wealth and decide millions of us die because of their stupid ideas.

Pentagon cannot account for 21 Trillion and it's likely more than that. Also, defense budget is nearly 1 Trillion per year. Let that sink in, in tax payer money... 21 Trillion of which, can't be accounted for... hmmm.

@_date: 2018-05-30 01:22:36
That's depends.
Them properly writing something down in a book becomes irrelevant with Bitcoin unless they really want to, they have transaction records that keep track of everything and all they would have to focus archive it in a secure location. If they don't it doesn't get lost because it's on Blockchain, and thus they can't earase any records, it would just be a pain in the add to audit them and search down which is which and I suppose the privacy of what those funds were used for works both ways in this case. But it would sort the terrible money accounting issue if they really cared to fix it. I doubt they do because they have every motive in the book not to properly report what every single tax payer penny is used for.

Absolutely not, your misunderstanding it, do I need to quote it? It is a list. It's not connecting, but only listing the locations in which the US was involved either directly militarily (Although illegally either in direct violation of its own National Law or International law respectively), covertly, or directly with goals of either taking down a government, installing their own influence, or gaining economic control, and even all of those things together under the cover of feel good buzzwords like "Freedom, Liberty" or "Human Rights" as is the case with countries like Iran.
Also, death counts are not "ovrrexaddurated" as much as they are determined by also accounting for casualties or possible thereof due to indirect reasons, for example blockading a region results in denial of access to medical and vital humanitarian supplies such as food and water which then results in deaths as in the case of the Israeli Palestinian issue. Though were only talking about the Economic aspects of this list because it pertains most to the evolution that has become of a Borderless currency like Bitcoin which countries like Iran have now turned their eyes to for avoiding things like sanctions, which by the way can indirectly cause thousands of deaths.

How have I got racist thoughts? Humans had been born free. The Earth provided the the food and water, and fertile ground from which to continue growth and good health. Yet over time those seeking power and control removed those natural rights, they Created currency, and it illegal to grow in the wild without permits and licenses, farms grow the food, sell to the market from which you have to buy your food with the currency theu created and control. They control the land too, so getting land is expensive. 
I digress, fast forward to today, Freedom is now a choice. You are born into a system, you are given a social number, your tagged by being given a Passport and information. You are not free to travel the earth freely, you must get a visa and cannot over stay in other regions of the earth. Your taxes to help on fiat which is backed by oil, which is a valuable resource that fuels wars of attrition. Me stating a fact, that Freedom is now a choice, is not rscist. It's the grim reality of society now. But now is better than ever to start creating a movement of Global Freedom, namely because we have access to information from every corner of the globe. We have access to the information that has had us in financial chains and shackles for decades. We have the choice to change that, because were humans. Our most valuable trait above all else, is choice.

Yes that's what I meant aswell. Any nuclear conflict is bound to be global due to the sensitive geopolitical implications of the exchange. But its hard to see any sort of survival of Bitcoin in such a scenario. The world would be crippled to the point that mere survival if at least that, would be the only priority. This is to say a portion of humans live long enough, because the remaining nuclear dust clouds would travel and fill the air while remaining nuclear reactors would overheat and melt down getting in the world's water supply beyond fathemable toxin levels and render all life non-existant for eternity.

Sorry to hear there is crazy stuff going on there, as is everywhere in the world, trust me. But the best way to fight violence, is with peace. Violence only leads to more anger and violence, and it becomes an ever perpetual cycle of violence. If I were to ever give some form of advice of a way forward, it's as simple as this. Forgiveness and love, understanding and progress, unity and strength. But most importantly, do not search for a way to peace, because there isn't necessarily a way to get to it... because peace is already possible just through actions of peace. There is nothing more the outside world likes more than divisions instead of peace because divisions mean control and influence, and thus it leads straight to more violence and divisions. Best of luck to you, and I hope stability comes to the regiin. If you want, you can PM me so I can get a better understanding. I havn't seen many credible sources in media reporting on the issue, just extreme figures calling for more military violence and suffering.

They didn't have to, because they only deal with the money. You don't need to fight when you manage the dollars from all sides and remain as neutral as possible. This is the problem though, war is a business and nothing else. Crypto is a final solution for the financial sustainability of everyone on a decentralized consensus platform. In world like that, peaceful coexistance becomes easier, the power is taken from the few who send the masses to die for their personal egos and reckless agendas.

I don't use the term "white" because it doesn't make sense. I use the Nation or region which pertains to the historical event that took place.
*"Great Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries. Despite briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the Cape was occupied again by the British in 1806. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire. British immigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers. The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce"*
So the British are the blame for what today plagues the region. This isn't the only region issue that has been the result of European political games across much of the world for economic gains at the expense of the Indiginous population for centries that predates generations.

Awesome insight into separation of powers in the UK. Though, I have to disagree that "of that is ever possible" with regards to a tryranical US government, it is very much possible, otherwise it wouldn't be in the constitution. Its meant more as a detterant becuase let's face it, no one wants to have to deal with such a burden. But unfortunately we live in a world where it is very possible. 
For example, we've returned to a McCarthyism era here in the U.S. where if you so as much as mention a Russian for any kind of information your considered a spy, or the enemy. Even if a Russian tells the truth, it becomes a threat here. 
This means only one thing, that the society has been so degraded that the truth harms them, and lies replace the truth only making things worse. You can take our interventions over seas as a prime example of active tyranny. Its just not targeting our people. Although It has in the past. We witnessed the government fire on its own civilians many times throughout history from Vietnam protests against the pointless war to fire bombing of Oklahoma in 1921 that massacred many Americans. There's no guarantee this won't happen again for any such reasons.

I disagree that "that's not one of them" referring to the idea we should exempt financial transaction privacy just because of the moral image the state might make to be sinister in nature. If that's the case, they really should (in the case of the United States at least) read the god damned Constitution again.
Secondly, if they challenge privacy of Bitcoin, I really don't understand why people are asking counter questions, like why the state hides it's transactions when we, the people (at leaat in the case of the United States once again) are the ones providing them with the funding to begin with in large part with our over taxed fiat. They waste our money in rediculous ways and then have the audacity to question why we would like to keep our financial transactions private. 
Oh, and *NOT* in the case of the United States only, but internationally, I think the rule of thumb goes that those who accuse others are usually responsible for the very words they speak of. In other words, every time the state bring a up Privacy Bitcoin/Crypto as criminal, we should remind them of the Panama papers which showed the world who the real money launderers are. It's not us by a long shot.

I think we've experienced two world wars and a third we won't survive if we don't duradtically change our way of thinking and progressing, and the Dollar isn't exactly helping. Bitcoin is a big answer to this problem, for example, because unlike the Pentagon you can't exactly have 21 Trillion of tax payer suddenly disappear in under 3 seconds without a transaction confirmation.

Well when you said hunting doesn't make you full, it depends on how well you hunt. This can also be applied to fighting for freedom. How wellvyou fight dictates the result. Hunting conditions change, so does fighting. You have to adapt to keep up and ultimately come out victorious for either. Not doing so results in a loss or *partial* result. You can still get some food from hunting. You can be free for a time, until conditions chanhe, tactics change, and then they get again in a different way.

@_date: 2018-05-29 23:47:24
Depends. Like a machine, it can be designed for both good and bad. Technologically speaking, Bitcoin is neutral because it plays the part of money. The moral part comes with its most common use, and the majority have so far expressed good intent in this regard for a better future without the current issues of central control over currency. So as long as mass adoption becomes a thing, it could mean the overall use is of good intent, and that has meaning of setting a moral standard by revolutionizing finance on an international level, for people, by people, without permission from a hierarchy.

Well, not quite. Trump is just another one of the long line of Presidents who ran on a platform that sounded good, but didn't actually check out. Once he got in Office, his objective was to "one up" the previous president and serve special and Foreign interests better than before, like every other president. You can tell because while he claimed to be withdrawing from Syria, in reality it was simply a reposturing move against Iran, which is similar to what Obama did with Afghanistan in the prior years.
Tulsi on the other hand from the get go, has been gloves off direct no backing down tackling of that system. She's taken a stance no one has taken since, well... JFK after the Bay of Pigs. Except she's doing it in a way that is much more grass roots. She's also a Veteran, so she has more honor and backing from a large community already that's suffered the consequences of the Wars, which she also fought in. She's also already congresswoman, and has Co-Sponsered many bills and legislation that benefit many regular Americans.
One thing I think would be cool is donating to her via. Crypto, perhaps partaking in her tour around the country and asking questions regarding Crypto policy. She's super open and attentive at community meet ups and events. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:38:02
So to you, what does that even mean? What's the conspiracy behind It? What's the difference between being "supported by Russia" vs being "supported by Britain"? It's funny how I assume your basis is founded around the idea Russia interfered in our election, it's no surprise this would be used against Tulsi, given the whole reason the Russia Gate exists is because Hillary couldn't find any other excuse to why she lost the election. She made deals with the FBI, she made deals with the British, all to spin the odds against Trump. In reality, she lost because the world found out she cheated Bernie Sanders out of the election, then Tulsi stepped down from the DNC in support of Bernie and our Democracy. 
Hillary couldn't stand the defeat so she poisoned and defiled this country with a lie that's now being used against both Trump and Democratic candidates. Honestly, she should be charged for treason.

Welp, I'm more of an optimist, so I'd have to counter by saying she's not only the best option for this country, but the best option for Crypto/Bitcoin as well.

@_date: 2019-03-17 02:30:34
I've given Trump the benefit of the doubt for long enough, here's my take though.
If the refirma he made work, im all for it. However, if he cared about Criminal Justice Reform, he would outlaw Private Prisons. These corporations are similar to the Military Industrial Complex. A Police Force is designed to serve and protect, and should NOT be privatized. Having to meet a quota of tickets is not a sign of serving and protecting, it's profiting from numbers of tickets given, which encourages creating reasons for tickets, or fabricating crimes for unjust arrests if there are none. Tulsi has provided a gloves of solution for this which many approve.
For Unemployment, that's not a sign the economy is doing good per say. Again, we live in a time when people work 2-3 jobs and both struggle to pay bills, put food on the table, as well as about 30 million still unable to afford healthcare. It wasn't really that much better under Obama, and his Obama care program was still just a bandaid rather than a comprehensive Healthcare reform. Tulsi has provided a gloves off solution, by supporting affordable Healthcare for all.
On climate... I'm no expert, but from the looks of things he's not doing enough. He critiqued AOC for putting forward the Green New Deal, many say it is vague, yet, no one else has put fourth such a robuat plan that is both short term, and long term for the benefit of keeping the Earth clean for generations. Trump could have done better, but he didn't. Many European countries, even African and Asian countries are showing us up in respect to Climate Change moves. I havnt heard much about this from Tulsi, mainly because I'm more concerned about foreign policy at the moment.
Now, in terms of North and South Korea, I need you to understand something. While Trump has made strides to find some kind of peace on the peninsula through a sudden change of rhetoric, it isn't Trump as much as it was the actions of the very determined Korean leaders to sidestep American influence in order to fester closer ties. Let's not forget that Trump had appointed people around him, Mike Pence, John Bolton, Elliot Abrams, and more (many of which are convicted War Criminals or Neo-Cons), who actually undermine Trump's every move towards peace. Trump might due he's doing something, yet, within 24 hours the actions are the complete opposite. Everyone knows North Korea will never give up it's nukes until it's provided with REAL assurances. No one knows this more than Tulsi, who explained it best: 
Our history prevents us from achieving peace, because very chance we had was used to backstab.
I digress, Tulsi has a much tougher stance, and doesn't back down. Her motives are backed with affirmative action, and it shows. She's a Veteran, she's used to it having served 2 tours in Iraq, she served our country, she's still young and now wishes to serve in a much stronger way, from a much stronger position. All of that, and she's Pro-Crypto.

Ok, well then it's clear. You believe that Corporate is an entirely untouchable class which can infringe on anyone and anything to any extent to which it chooses, simply because you say it isn't specified in the 1st Amendment. In which case, I would say the last part of the 1st Amendment is the part I'm exercising. 
**"and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."**
People across the country have been trying to put restrictions on Corporations because they've been allowed to not only silence people whom they do not like, but that've also targeted individuals, activists, journalists and even Presidential Candidates based on either personal or well connected ties to powerful figures in the political world, which by extension, do have direct support of members of Congress.

So it's not ok for the Government to stomp on your Constitutionally protected rights, but you're completely fine with Private Corporations operating entirely outside of the Constitution? I bet you 50 Bitcoin you'll change your mind when you're wearing the shoes of the person on the receiving end of that stick any day.
But regardless, I'm a believer that Corporatiosn arent people and money isn'tspeech, so if a Provate Company thinks they can step on people's Constitutional rights, what they've really said is they declare War on your way of life so they may get whatever they want. Also, perhaps you should educate yourself, and understand that Private Companies largely don't always act on their own. Decisions like this merit an 80% chance they are influenced by the Government in some way to do what they're doing.

Did you miss it? When I said I believe that Corporations aren't people, and money isnt speech? The reality is that is the way the Corporate class treat their business. So why then would PayPal prohibit people from being able to donate to someone? If money is speech, **by their own rules then they're directly infringing on speech, in two ways.**
This has nothing to do with Business relations with other businesses, but has everything to do with Constiturional Rights, and the over reaching arm of Corporate influence upon inalienable rights.

I support Decentralized platforms. Things like Brave for example solve a multitude of problems.

Oh yes, NBC, a pro-War outlet that's also complicit in lying the American into the Iraq War based on a lie that, to this day, it hasn't been punished for. It's no surprise they would publish a slander hit piece like that against a VETERAN, and Acting Congresswoman. They have no shame, never have, never will, which is what Tulsi Gabbard has vowed to fix because no one else has to balls to do so.
I look at Tulsi Gabbard's record, not bullshit corporate Media Conspiracy theories. If they lied about the Iraq War, what makes you think their story about a candidate who vows to fix it are real? They're not a source of information, they're a source of deliberate disinformation.

Your both right. China is a special case, their patriotism is so ingrained however that in the event the Chinese Communist Party saw themselves falling due to US pressures they could easily stole up morale in the people, which would result in major boost of internal anger towards US businesses, and influence, thus flipping what could be a tactic to isolate the CCP, into a tactic that backfire entirely and only further angers the Chinese collectively. Nukes would be left out of it at first, but it wouldn't be very difficult at least now for China to repel any sort of direct US military aim, and that's also dependant whether or not neighboring countries have an appetite for such a confrontation with the risk of unacceptable losses to their economy and military.
In which case, China being a regional powerhouse with massive projects such as the OBOR, they have the advantage in this fight, boosted by their rapid closing of the technology gap with the US Military Industrial Complex, on top of their vast number of military personnel. Then it turns into a situation where the US has to decide whether or not it's truly that desperate to initiate a hot war after a prolonged cold war which would be guaranteed to inflict unacceptable damage to itself.

Instead of Mega corporations getting the say in how we live as of now, with problems such as Monopoly mergers of AT&amp;T + T-Mobile + Time Warner, as well as Net Neutrality being destroyed despite global opposition to it, Decentralized Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is like the people having that same power to fund, create, innovate their own solutions without having to be approved by central entities that have been proven keen on screwing over the masses to benefit the few.
Now the masses can rule as a collective consensus rather than be ruled over.

Wrong. It would have seen more wide scale use because people at 1 dollar, 20 cents, we're using it to purchase things like pizzas, etc. It was an ideal borderless currency then, and remains so now.
To the contrary, the price increase only brought an influx of mostly toxic people only looking to get rich quick and show off, pretty much a new generation of elitist wannabes. Hence why the entire subreddit is mainly about Lambos and moon memes, that of which doesn't even touch on the problems Bitcoin was designed to fix. They dont care, they want money.

*This* as in Crypto or the article in general? If its for Crypto, I think it's more of a way to stop government and central corruption rather than entirely get rid of government funded programs. Though a donation system could be done through crypto aswell. I don't see Fiat currencies dying entirely, as there can still be currencies backed by gold that remain stable and well regulated. The problem is now there isnt, and corruption overrides legitimate problem solving to the extent a radical new tech like Blockchain had to be developed to drastically fix it.

It was never about Moons and Lambos.

I guess, or maybe Bitcoin was being developed during the time so it couldn't be used. With how long it takes to develop some projects I can almost ensure development started awhile back when many were more openly aware and outspoken of the problems with the current central banking system. As the generations pass, more and more people grow up just not knowing or not seeking tbat information, and even though Bitcoin has come into being, many simply don't understand it, at all. So those in Bitcoin right now are a very small amount of the world population, while the majority have succumb to the mystery and question of what it even is, and as such it's harder for mass society to accept it.
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:13:02
What problem is that? If you're not old enough to have witnessed the interests of a company being used to destroy a country, you should be rethinking why you're in Crypto to begin with. 
Either your for a Decentralized Globalization movement that frees the individual and gives them the same power central banks do, or your against freedom and liberty entirely. My mind is made up, I'm on the side of the good guys.
All I'm saying is this. Blockchain is much bigger than what ever get rich quick scheme most people came here for. The value of a coin means absolutely nothing right now. It's all about what side of history your about to be on.
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:19:07
It's just getting started is correct. Once we start decentralizing everything else, Bitcoin falls perfectly in place. We need to  Decentralize the world in order for Bitcoin to be a world currency. Who's up for the task? Excellent, let's get this thing on a roll!

Well, in most cases no. The bank isn't going to reimburse you for stolen money. But at the point someone is forcing you to log into your own virtual safe, at that point it's up to you whether to protect all the money you own with your life or not.

Once people embrqce tribalism then the purpose of Bitcoin goes down the drain. I think that's what Ver was selected to do. Don't follow a man. Bitcoin is about collectivism, not sheepism.

@_date: 2018-06-16 12:35:32
Given how the Government has been acting recently, for the past few decades... I'm confident it isn't them, or at least their main inner circles who created Bitcoin.
The more likely scenario if any, is that those loyal to the original vision and dream were the ones who created it. Paired with an anonymous name like Satoshi Nakamoto, not knowing whether it's a group of people or an individual, although more than likely a group given the effort put into developing Bitcoin, "no man is an island."
The core values of Bitcoin layer out by Satoshi in the white paper also could show you a clear defined path away from the "total control" scenario the Government is currently undertaking. Bitcoin is Decentralized, usable by anyone anywhere, securely, and unrestricted by borders. The fact that everyone is trying so hard  (at least in the Government sectors) to catch up, is also another sign that it's more unlikely it would have been them.
*HOWEVER*, I find it more likely to assume the price of  Bitcoin shooting up to such high value could have been the result of a Central counter attack. Doing so does a few things. Shooting up the price fractures the Bitcoin community. It goes from supporting the tech for its intended purpose to "Moon and Lambo" dopamine that distracts people from the real use. Thus when Bitcoin later crashes, people lose interest and even a large amount of money. Those who would have continued collecting and using Bitcoin as money have either sold somewhere up the lines, or somewhere down in fear. Others who HODL might be different and understand, but that's likely a fraction of a minority.
But really it's hard to tell. But if your concerned about government interference, simply keep on supporting Bitcoin. An international currency not owned or controlled by a single centralized entity is an amazing thing for the world.

A fuck ton of energy huh? Well if there was a solar panel on the roof of every home on the planet connected to a decentralized power grid, there would be enough energy for that and much more.
But let's forget that for a second because I think many people are actually underestimating it. For example, Lightning Network solves that slow and inefficient transaction speed of Bitcoin from sometimes an hour, down to just 3 seconds, something that major Blockchain projects are trying to do to surpass Bitcoin, has already been solved by Bitcoin.

Based on the very well known history of US dominant aims of controlling the next valuable global commodity, It might as well be Oil. It's arguable that Oil seems to be the most sought after resource due to its vast value and use in every economy anywhere there are cars for example. The US initiative to hold, and exploit oil directly from Kurdish regions in Syria, as before was done in countries like Iraq, as well as in Iran after its overthrow previously, and Libya, it seems like it would be Oil.
Officially though, probably not, but its hard to believe the US dollar is backed buy absolutely nothing.

That's where you're wrong. It might not be interesting for the common person, but that's only because they're blissfully unaware of the unstable grounds their current financial system stands on, and what provides it stability. 
That or they're scared, or maybe even aware yet they've been mislead into believing the tech is either for something else entirely, or purely sinister in nature. At least, in the developed world.
In the rest of the world, more people are interested because their perspective on it is entirely different, and thus they can see more potential and more use of it. Only when disaster strikes here in the US will everyone suddenly be shaken from their hypnosis and realize what the technology could do for them. I'm surprised most people aren't already jumping to it, seeing as Monopolies are taking shape, and paired with moves towards more censorship, survailance, and denial to basic fundamental rights like Net Neutrality on the brink being destroyed. Blockchain provides an answer to all of these problems, but you can't blame the deceived for their own lack of awareness.

Ok, you made some points aside from the worthless insult, I never called you a child, but I digress.
I neither hold "bags", but obviously you were in if for the money. Let's be honest, no one would have cared about Cryptocurrency if the price didn't shoot up past the worth of gold itself. Why do people care now? Like you, it's greed who drives them, I respect that, everyone wants to hit big and take it easy somewhere for the rest of time. But at the end of the day, it's not about you, or me, really it's about humanity.
So let's see, how is it inefficient? Compared to our current system? I don't think Blockchain would be so worthless with nearly half a trillion in investments. Altcoins as I see it are entirely a distraction, as you said for people trying to get rich quick. Other than a few that have real use for Blockchain such as agriculture tracking of goods and transactions, even voting. As we all know, election interference isn't just a problem for the US. Blockchain can secure and repair voting mechanisms that have been broken and abused. It's a consensus algorithm, it's designed to bring balance to a world with barely any of it. This is how this "database" will fix inequality. 
Now imagine this on a Global scale. Imagine the world being able to verify the complete denuclearization of all Nations. Imagine the world being able to govern itself through the decisions of the people instead of a one head of a state from each nation. Instead of one person trying to decide for everyone what's priority, what's important, real people with real problems and vote and fund directly to solve problems they face.

So first, you claim the report would be written by me. You'd be wrong, as I'm only suggesting the community come together and write a report of all the bad things the Central Banks have done, not just for one centry, but since it's existence, mainly highlighting corruption and global exploitation of defenseless countries, and helping elite launder money (AKA theft, which they always blame Crypto for being a benefit of).
Second, you go ahead and claim I am so person looking to get rich quick and then claim I would want everyone else to be slaves. Funny, it's almost like you're trying to make my mind for me. That's not the way this works.
And third, you then claim Central Banks work hard all their life, and I Don't? Again, it's almost like you're trying to paint my life with your sinister brush and dull colors. Did I hit a special nerve? Did my request for a consensus and detailed community investigation into the history of the Central Bank hurt your feelings?
You know, the others are right, it's not even needed. There's already enough evidence from a variety of sources that prove the over reaching global corruption in the Central Banking system is in it truly to profit while everyone else can easily be considered slaves. And Bitcoin was designed to end that global slavery. Here we are, whether you like it or not. Get with it.
We know Satoshi is unknown. But we also know how the tech works. So as long as we keep using the tech and steering it towards good intentions, theres nothing to worry about.

It would be incorrect to suggest the State is acting against the people. The correct assessment, however, is that the state has been hijacked by wealthy individuals who have become entirely disconnected from what everyone in the middle and lower class have to deal with to survive. 
As such the divide isn't a State vs. People struggle.
The divide is the same as it was in France before the Revolution. The only difference is you replace a Monarchy with an Oligarchy or class of people who see their wealth as a reign and whom see everyone else as below, and less than them.

Julian is to Journalism what Bitcoin is to Finance. Unbiased publishing of sensitive truths that no one else will publish because their NOT allowed to. That's not Free Press.

I do follow the story, but not from the perspective of conspiracy theorists.
You're right, you can be a Journalist, but once you lie to the public, or use information with sinister intent, I don't believe you could be classified as a Journalist anymore. Julian however, has NOT become one of these shady actors, and History proves it.
Read "Manufacturing Conscent" by Noam Chomseky.
This isn't about Journalism and Crime as much as it is about silencing the voice of truth in a time when it matters the most. I would say if you can't see that, I would hope you come to realize that it is what Julian has published that has proven that those who threaten his Innocence, are the REAL criminals. That's why they want him so bad. The United Nations, along with much of the world aknoledges his confinement and arrest is illegal, unjust, and disgusting. 
Even Veterans in this country are starting to speak out against the atrocities that are being carried out globally in the name of profit, at the expense of millions. And just to address that last bogus claim about him specifically targeting America, it's falae. You can access Wikileaks archives at any time, which contain files relating to ALL governments. If it wasn't for Julian, some real atrocities would have gone unchecked.

Manning already served her sentence for it.

Stuff usually doesn't happen in the West anymore because the Media isn't actual investigative journalism anymore. It's more like state sanctioned lobbying. They all read from scripts in this era, so there no trouble to begin with.

I thinl thats just someone's way of half insulting someone, half calling them evil. I highly doubt anyone in their right mind believes another homosapien is an entirely separate species. But yes, I see what your doing. You're aquaiting the statement to something that sounds rediculous in order to male the entire thing sound... rediculous. We all know how this works, and you can stop. You're not fooling anyone. Humans aren't perfect, but the world doesn't need this woman to tell us who owns the money. Even the British steal and hoard mass amounts of gold and artifacts from various regions which they set foot in. However, with organizations like the Vatican which is highly secretive, things get alot weirder, and for good reason... that's why it's mostly a secret society and what happens inside the walls stays insode the walls. It's no secret there are some messed up people In this world. But let's stick with the obvious and stop bringing conspiracies like "other species" into this thread. Though again, I'm pretty sure that's her version of an insult.

Well, I can't explain everything, but I'll water down the Korean war a little. China and Russia to the North are US adversaries. Aside from that, North Korea was at one point completely destroyed before China with the help of the USSR and it's advanced jets pushed the West back to the 39th parallel, or the DMZ as it's now known. A peace treaty was never signed, and that's not because anyone wanted to continue fighting later on. An armistace was signed instead because it was designed to remain a contested and dangerous gambling chip to a global economic strategy, which involves War as the main asset to the Economy.
So the idea that a war is less likely is false. The war will happen, it's not a matter of if, but when. It could be next month, or it could be in the next decade. Don't forget, even Libya agreed to peace initiatives, and shortly after, it was completely destroyed. There is no morality in War. Remember that.

I habe high expectations that their Fiat Gateway shouldn't be unachievable either, but the Crypto Card (as I'll call it, let's make a META out of this), I'm not sure how well this will go. I don't believe it's been done, or maybe it has for Bitcoin, or other more widely used coins... however for a spectrum of main AND altcoins... either I'm missing something, or I havnt done enough homework on it... none the less, it's much to be excited about.

No worries, this is a Organization formed out of Canada with the moral backing obligation by the founder being, "Tell the truth no matter what". This source also criticises Russia to a good degree aswell for its history, and I've found that they don't really remain biased when it comes to reporting in wrong doings of any nation state. In short, I've yet to find an article where they've made any nation look like the "good guy" over another which is nearly impossible to find in today's news. While some articles may seem Pro-Russian there are as many "Pro-US", and "Pro-UK", while still providing a balanced criticism of all countries involved in the research.

They can stick their fingers in any pot they can get a profit out of, that's all. Now it terms of how they are planning on doing so, I reckon it has to do less with physically regulating Bitcoin, and more along the lines of actially just passing a whole host of laws in the US. Not only in the US, but also by influencing other nations around the world that also use Bitcoin. These laws are likely to benefit them, and become a thorn in the side of every day users of Bitcoin.

This is true as it is with any nation, not just Russia. Everyone's mature enough to understand this and extract bias and BS from the narrative. But it is also very much worth noting above all, that no Nation is on the roster of "Good guy", and the consensus around Cryptocurrency is such that the world is beggining to understand that wealth and stability simply cannot and should not be controlled by men in hierarchy any longer. Humanity has very well survived it's end on more than 2 occasions.
There's no other reason much of the world is fighting Crypto so much. Most institutions won't even call it money, rather call it Securities or Property. They aren't stupid, they exactly what it is. They know it brings freedom and financial control to the Individual, that which the current world rulers are heavily against, but its coming whether they like it or not, and hopefully, within 5-10 years we could all live to witness the fall of the great empires of suffering and debt based credit pegged to the War Industry.

Not really. See for example it's the same as having videos of people riding bikes, or racing, or flying a hang glider, or playing a really scary game. Experiencing someone getting terrified is a joy in itself, or maybe the player is skilled, then it's like watching a sport. In fact, there's a whole industry created for it, EA Sports (granted it's limited and its not everyone's thing, it exists), and there's future potential for games. But then there's maybe something about the person someone's watching and less about the game. When I watch streams I am there for the Character of the streamer. Usually someone with strong moral views and professional quality content. It's more enjoyable than any big name TV series in that respect. Some people take it to the next level by donating, in some case thousands of dollars because they really enjoy that person and what they do. Nothing stupid about at all.

Well, "fuck up sometimes" is the biggest understatement of the century, at least regarding banks. Why do you think most banks are based on credit? In fact, just use your brain for a second, it doesn't take a teen to understand the current global bank system is a debt based system. It's fundamentally flawed, and designed to be so. You may think I wear a tinfoil hat, but most people who use that phrase have been consistently proven wrong throughout history. I've no problem without being called the defender of truth.

Well that depends, if what you're saying is that they don't have an exchange for their Fiat into Crypto, then I could believe that. I'm not aware of any exchanges that provide that yet. But, if you're saying they simply don't have money, as in poor, that's far from the truth. Some places have less than others yes, but the limitation I see is merely in the comparability end of things.

I think it falls more along the lines of this. You are a poor man right? You do some things through time, and eventually you end up wealthy as hell. Over time, that wealth changes who you are, as well as who you hang around up there among the ranks of the wealthy. Their opinions and actions, as well as far reaching influences change you... in some cases that can corrupt any good man, and turn them into something else... So what Bill Gates was, is far from what he is now. Mot saying he was good, and has become evil, but age also does things. So what he knew then, and knows now, are also two completely different things. But this comment of his is beyond rediculous. Regular money had been used to buy fentanyl. Not only that, regular money has done things to humanity that have brought it, and the earth, to the brink of complete and total ahnialation, not just once, not just twice, but quite a few times. Regular money has facilitated the abuse of humans as collateral, or worthless objects throughout history, it's facilitied nearly unspeakable atrocities, and yet, Bill Gates seeks to come and say Bitcoin is like the Plague because people have used it in a sinister way anonymously?

Depends. For example, Tesla is and has been spear heading the transition to more Solar based energy. This is good, for Earth, and for future generations having a better enviornment yo live it. It's also good in the event of emergencies or catastrpohs, because being able to hack up power from storage units across a large area of a country, is something that Australia for example struggled with recently until Tesla came in, and proved how reliable solar really is. Tesla isn't just a car company, but a sort of a pillar, or Beacon of a woke industry Musk is setting up. That stock, represents a future more than it does a current time frame. Though, that's kinda at least how I feel. I won't get into too much regarding that, I don't know a whole lot about stocks to be honest.

Also, there's a reason one of the investigative journalists in Malta, of all places, was killed in a Car Bomb right outside of her home. She was a leading investigator into more detailed papers.

Funny. Because Russia's interests directly align with American interests at this particular point in history. Example, as an American, I for one want my family and friends out of the Middle East so we can stop fighting for wars our Congress, and thus we, never voted to fight in. You want to talk about best interests, ahit goes far deeper than the surface drama you see today. The intelligence community wants to continue a tense and costly relationship? I dont, because my tax payer dollars are what's making that massive *$750,000,000,000.00 PER YEAR* that's being used to defend a Europe that really doesn't need to be defended. Our reckless expansion of NATO after the fall of the Soviets only justifies their actions like Ukraine. They only do those things because of what we did to conscript so many nations surrounding them. We encircled them, put missiles next to them, and they release a whole 6 course meal of invicible nuclear weapons. That's not the kind of fucking relationship I as an American want with Russia. It's expensive, and it's deadly.

Well, there's also the fact that a 750 Billion per year defense budget has to come from somewhere. Taxes. And that's the main issue here and why Bitcoin could help.

There's a reason we broke away from Britain, to escape that abusive policy of stealing from under our noses and funding their imperialism.

I think they're all connected. It's more of a crime syndicate than a legal governmental body. Just look into the history of how the Federal Reserve was founded. They literally had to elect a President who was for enacting them as an entity. Others were against it because they knew what it meant. They knew of Central Banks were and they didn't want it, overwhelmingly. Yet, it happened when they get their boy in office. Can't remember the presidents name. Just look it up.

It gives everyone equally more buying power, and how they use it is entirely up to them.

People keep forgetting we don't need mass adoption. It wouldn't achieve anything really. Bitcoin has already done what it's supposed to and will continue to do so regardless of price, and amount of people using it. It's not going to destroy fiat, and that's fine. It may make it better though by proving to be extremely valuable when Fiats go through their collapse cycle, as Venezuala has proved. Despite the collapse, Bitcoin can come in as the currency that helps to bypass the corruption and inflation problems facing people in that region.

Look up COINTELRPO, operation Mockingbird, Operation Northwoods. All declassified documents by the way. 
There's a reason they Redact so much things, because if we actually read more of what they declassified, you too would trust Putin more than you trust them, that's how serious it is.

It depends on how you see it. Slavery as it was done in the past isn't as easy to pull off in a Modern civilization. But just because we've supposedly got past that, doesn't mean it's gone. Like technology and the times, methods and means change. Slavery doesn't have to mean literal chains and collars. It can also mean financial, political, economic slavery.
For example, rent today is at least 1000 a month. That doesn't include disgustingly high taxes, having a car, bills, medical expenses, possibly children, etc. So having a job and getting paid in USD doesn't ensure breathing room, especially if you get sick and lose hours, you could easily end up homeless this way. 
That can easily be considered financial and economic slavery. The housing market in North America is currently fucked, unless you find a place waaaaaay in the middle of nowhere, but then you just pay more petrol costs for the distance.

Exactly. In fact even now, I feel like it's only gotten worse. People have so willfully turned a blind eye to the problems, maybe they think they don't have the power to fix it, especially now with Blockchain readily available to ditch that broken system. 
I the fact is people aren't informed. Education is not what it's supposed to be. In school, I remember learning about history, nothing has ever touched on reality. Only shilling false patriotism without a hint of actual problems that we face and how to solve them. This is what's keeping people on the dark.

My problem with Yang, is he hasn't provided an answer as to how he intends on ending wasteful budgets. His foreign Policy is just one example that is severely lacking. 
Also, if you want to learn more about UBI, how about actually looking into the pilot projects in Europe and even Canada and look into the Data for the answer to your questions on how effective it is. After all, everyone will put onto you their opinion, but math doesn't lie. Seek the math.

No, i understand aswell. I feel like Bitcoin has essentially become the gold of Crypto, where as its used to get into other coins.

@_date: 2018-04-22 22:27:13
The market is Cryptocurrency. 
The problem is Centralization. 
The goal is mass adoption of Decentralization. 
The foundation is Bitcoin. 
How can everyone get interested in Bitcoin if there isn't a user friendly platform with educational lessons that teach the basis of Cryptocurrency starting with Bitcoin? So far, I only see Ethos doing that, taking the Token entirely out of the equation. The intent is to bring more people safely into Crypto. But sure I suppose my excitement from what I've experienced is a bit premature in that sense I'll give you that. In theory, without the product and up until the product is available and tangible it's a scam. But I do know a handful of people who have access already to to product and have used and are testing it and they have proved it is not a scam. But yes, don't take that from me, just wait, as I said I am, and is why I am excited to see the future when many people are introduced into Crypto.

@_date: 2018-04-22 22:35:13
Its weird that you cant answer it or find it on google, yet i can and answer them aswell? Again I don't yet have access to the product because it's in closed BETA, just like your latest video game, etc. I know a few people testing it, as well as there is footage and screenshots of the product, as well as its code in action, as well as some errors and screenshots that posted of it. It's not available because they are fine tuning it for a proper release, kinda like how games are pushed back to later dates. There isn't a mass adoption of Ethos, but its possible. The unique proposition is a product you can give to anyone, and they could learn and understand what Bitcoin is, what other Cryptocurrency is, and how it can be used safely, and securely. Sure there are many videos on YouTube, but there are no products that gives a clueless person a crash lesson in Cryptocurrency, aside from over priced lessons from well know self procialmed "Crypto-Experts" on YouTube which may as well be leveled as Scam-lessons. Lastly what is happening with Ethos is it's undergoing meticulous testing because you really don't want to screw up a product that holds your financial assets.

Ahhh, understood. Well I didn't mention that the main initiative for Ethos was to provide a Universal Wallet to anyone who has a Cellphone and Internet connection using cold storage. The target was wealth inequality and imaccess to Cryptocurrency, but as long as I have a Smartphone, and Internet with Ethos UW, I can access decentralized financial services that I control nearly anywhere.
 So if I were in Zimbabwe for example, and i didn't want to travel to a Bitcoin ATM, I could use Ethos as long as I have a phone and internet, as well as access to 100 other ERC20 tokens to trade from. In the future the goal was a social element as well as traditional stocks access, and Fiat Gateway.

@_date: 2018-04-02 17:16:15
Ahhh... hmmm, but suppose then they opt to use their holdings more for manipulation, such as pump and dumps, including coordinated pump and dumbs between governments. Could that not kill the Bitcoin price, thus making not so confidant holders sell aswell, leaving it open for buying from more whales and this making it worse for the average?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:22:20
I'm not promoting a token. Ethos will be a platform to help get clueless peiple who think the Crypto world is dark and evil, into Crypto by using education, user friendly interface and a universal wallet. Not a single time did I tell someone to purchase anything. All I said was I can't wait for it, because the more main stream crypto becomes, the sooner mass adoption, the sooner more people get into Bitcoin and Decentralization.

"The government couldn't give a shit about owning some digital currency"
You couldn't be more wrong. I don't think you understand where Fiat will be in 10, 5, maybe even 2 years from now. It's almost as if people to forget we live in a world where one second everything I about fun and jazz music and the next, 50% of those very people die in a world war. The great depression wasn't that long ago, and I'll be damned if the Government is going to keeps it's eggs in the Fiat basket.

Blockchain. You have a set amount of currency. You can't over print and inflate it to death. It can't be stolen (tevhnically), and as such it requires a fundamental overhaul of the financial system and how things are handled. Since people are their own banks, essentially owning and handling their finances more securely, it means that their is risk for example in reckless spending. In the case of the national debt, since you can't over print or over spend and then steal from the common person, you have no options to in debt society as waseadoly done before with infinitely printable fiat. This is just my theory, I'm still researching it. I'm confusing myself a little, but I hope this is understandable.

Until more Fiat gateways allow direct purchase of Altcoins at least.
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:49:44
Well then thats obviously different. I was reffering to actual Altcoins, with tangible business and economic products that are worth more than they currently cost. Once Fiat allows a way for direct investment, it will possibly help unhindge the need to use Bitcoin pr Ethereum as a means to buy into those other coins.

He's not a "Russian tool". He gets information from everyone, including the US, Russia, Spain, Bolivia, it doesn't matter. It's Wikileaks, you can't find just as much dirt on any country from them. The only reason it became such a scandal is due to Clinton using Assange as the scape goat for her failures. Notice before Assange leaked anyrhing about the stupid "email", or "DNC" crap, there was virtually no talk about him. After he revealed what happened with the DNC between her and Bernie, he became the perfect Patzi.

Not what I'm saying. I'm saying when some regions make it legal to pay taxes in Bitcoin, it's a trap basically, because enough people paying taxes in Bitcoin, means Bitcoin going into ownership of central hands, possibly making them whales in the long run granted they hang on to it themselves.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:15:50
Not exactly. Some have valubale technological leaps over the latter. Alrhough, Bitcoin is the original King, nothing will ever beat it as the pure Decentralized Peer to Peer currency it is supposed to be. However, things like Ethereum and Neo obviously have applications for other things related to Blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-04-28 22:43:12
I find it funny, that even food, water even, are not valuable technically. Their necessary to your survival yes, but only became valuable after it became illegal to grow and harvest food freely from the land. Land became owned, and food had to be produced by farmers, and then sold in a market, thus begins the destruction of basic human inheritance. Items were used as currency to purchase food, water you could still obtain via rivers, etc. But as time moved on even that becomes a risky proposition due to contamination, another self defeating result of our reckless effects on the enviornment.

@_date: 2018-04-11 03:14:44
Actually. Youre both right and wrong. Crypto in general, at its basis, was designed to be P2P money, that is decentralized, and puts the wealth back in the hands of the people, without the ability for central entities (like those of Rockefeller, Soros, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs) from manipulating, or from interfering in the people's pockets in any form of way, while remaining extremely secure.

Used to think Bitcoim couldnt be worth more than gold. But then it went over 19k. Then you realize, the value of a currency that is not owned by institutions who cause us to suffer for their control, is indeed, more valuable than Wealth in every sense of the word. Also, Diamonds are worthless. Its just marketing by a central organization that controls all of it and sells you the dream of giving a shiny condensed carbon to your lover, otherwise you are worthless... then they slap a huge price on it.

Coinbase is officially a centralized entity against the very fundamentals of Cryptocurrency. This calls for an absolute distancing from Coinbase by the Bitocin and Crypto community. I'm sure there are better options. First It's Wikileaks, then in the future, who is next? What's to prove they wouldnt do this to more people based on a political or militaristic ideology? F*** that. I'm leaving Coinbase, everyone else should too, and we should help invest in an Exchange that fits the vision of Bitcoin and Crypto's destined future.

Probably a glitch. Meh.
Regarding Politicians being the same, what I mean is they tell you what you want to hear unless they profit for a different Agenda. In other words, they do not see eye to eye with the interests of the people. Maybe some are different, example being Rand/Ron Paul for examples as politician's with actual thinking skills, most are hardline loyalists to their lobbies. After all, they would never bite the hand that feeds them. Most, anyways.

This isnt the thread for this, but you want facts? Ill give you some real hard Facts. 
No, he's not. But, let's for a minute assume that he is. I'm no Russian tool, and I'm certainly not a fan of the Russian Propaganda bullcrap either and silencing of independent investigative journalists. But, how is it then that him simply criticising and exposing the hypocrisy and foul play in the US system falls into the genre of "Russian Propaganda Machine", despite him also leaking documents on Russia aswell? 
Don't you think it's funny that then, the US has degraded it's society so far, that Others like Assange speaking the truth is in itself harmful to US interests? You mentioned Snowden. Well acoording to the Constitution, the US shouldn't even be doing the things Snowden revealed. So despite him breaking rules and ending up in Russia (because lets face it, who else is going to accept him where he can't be used as a bargaining chip), if the US was only fulfilling it's Constitutional Obligations and actually upholding Peace, Liberty and Justice, would the "Russian Tools" not have such an easy time simply picking harsh truths that the US preaches far too much more than it a really follows it's own guidlines? And there's plenty of declassified stuff, also including the tracking of those using Bitcoin for example, that prove its abuse and constant disregard for the constitution, that all the trolls have to do is speak the truth and it fools every day Americans into actually believing thay wrong is right only because the enemy is telling the truth. The Truth becomes bad, and the US is no longer capable of criticising itself, and as a result, can never improve, only falling down an infinite rabbit hole of self degradation? 
From what I can see we've passes the Tea Party era. We spend so much tax payer dollars for pointless and endless wars again, just like when we had to break away from Great Britain, and now, we're right back, even surpassing square one. What does that tell you? Look at the National Debt. It wasnt supposed to be like this, but now things like Bitcoin are practically the only way to save us from the harsh reality of what happens when the true bubble pops.

It's not about the Token as much as it is the project. They rebranded because they were becoming more mainstream and their product needed a more simple and user friendly Logo and Brand name. That's called Marketing, and this is a Market. I don't see a problem as long as it's not a scam, and from the research I've done, and from the product demos they have shown, its clearly the real deal with what they're looking to accomplish. 
*I'm not saying it is "THE" revolution as much as I'm saying it will only help to boost the Revolution. Ethos will be like the Twitch of Cryptocurrency in a sense, it will have a social aspect as well as mainstream easy to use and understand elements that will help to get the average clueless person interested and into Crypto.*
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:35:47
Yeah, but I'm waiting for Ethos anyways. That's where the true revolution begins mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:22:27
Agreed. One final thing I understand is that through Ethos and their UW, the plan is to allow trading. At first this would be done by factoring in the exchange rate of a handful of exchanges and choosing the best price for the user. Later, they plan on creating a system where trades are done between actual people instead of through exchanges. This theoretically greatly reduces the costs. If this does happen, it would be a game changer, but i forsee it wouldn't be a nail in the coffin of exchanges right away, as exchanges would still see use, just not as much as before.
Here's something I forgot to post.
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:03:59
True, but i feel like fiat may not exist as it does today, or maybe it will in a more stable form it was intended (not credit based infinitely printrd, but reserve based/backed by gold), in which case how would that then effect the future of Crypto, which is predicted to be a world where many countries have more than  one currency, yet all currencies can be interchanged in mere minutes or even seconds for others? Of course I guess you could say Gold is centralized, but currently Bitcoin isn't exactly backed by gold, rather it appears its the combination of trust and technology that gives it value?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:15:30

I can't see the difference between you and a child. If you don't like Ethos, explain why. Don't come on here talking about "everything aside from this is bullshit" because that's obviously not the case. Etheruem wouldn't exist then and wouldn't cost so much if it was useless would It? How about Neo? EOS? This is a market, not an Ego Playground. Stop standing in front of trains and pretending they won't go through you.

They have their own satellites, but yes, that's a valid concern. One of the biggest issues with 5G isn't so much a health issue as much as it is a Military Abuse one. The concern with that tech is the same, being that no matter who dominates with 5G, there's no denying that such Organizations would just simply lie to your face as they do now as they gather information on you in super accurate real time, 24/7, connected to all devices and tech you use with 5G.
What needs to happen to stop this abuse is us as people actually taking to our responsability to regulate these Organizations with 100% oversight. We shouldn't continue allowing people with no Oversight to abuse the technologies of the future that will inevitably be abused and directly affect not only us, but countless generations after us.
