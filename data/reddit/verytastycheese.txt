People regularly need to walk in to a bank to negotiate a check or send a wire payment, both of which only work during business hours. 
Checks because the bank needs to decide whether to hold it for 5 days for clearing or credit the client's account immediately. For larger checks this can be an issue if you don't have a history of that size of check or the source is unusual. Bitcoin doesn't have this issue because the funds actually clear within 1 hour. 
For wire payments you need ID. Banks won't take emailed instructions (at least none I've worked with) because they want to ensure ID to avoid fraud. Banks could use PGP and signed messages to avoid this issue but they're just behind the times. Also wires don't usually clear within an hour, especially internationally, and they usually have fees on both the sending and receiving ends. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 08:54:02
Either way it is naive to think these coins won't reach or affect the market. If they wait for the price to go up and then sell, they'll be holding back an increase. If they get them for a discount and sell, it'll lower the price. I never said it would crash the market, but the market depth is nowhere near the market cap. Technically they could temporarily crash the market with a dump, but it would be stupid to do so.

So the basis of your conviction is that "this isn't even that far fetched." I mean sure, I agree, but that doesn't mean you, or the article author, or the OP/title author can state it as fact. Title should read "NSA could have known about and been using the heartbleed exploit for years. No-one is shocked..."
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:46:21
I had to scroll way too far for this. The entire article is based off the line "two people familiar with the matter said." So did a couple people on youtube say "Haha the NSA knew about it all along and haxxed you all!" or what? Where's the evidence? This is an extremely substantial claim to make off 2 anonymous statements and NO background info or evidence. I'll hold my judgement for now. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:38:26
I never said cash sucks, it works great in certain situations. When bitcoin is ubiquitous it will be easy to use NFC or something but in the meantime forcing bitcoin payments in this sense will just slow things down and make it awkward. IMO bitcoin's power lies in large value transfers, secure cold storage, and international payments. Micropayments are easy enough in place of credit/debit machines, since they're slow enough anyway, but I'm not expecting my shopping carts to take bitcoin any time soon. Trying to force them in a busy bar situation will just turn people off of them altogether.

The fiat doesn't need to come from the bank, it's just a convenient/safe place to keep it. Bitcoin fulfills this function provided you know how to encrypt and safely backup your keys. 
My employer could just pay me cash, and I could walk to the utility companies' offices with it, but that's just not convenient.

@_date: 2014-03-04 00:47:05
He didn't actually say get out, just that Bitcoin isn't a currency, and that it's a speculative bet. I'm sure most of us are well aware of these things already, so it doesn't diminish the merit of Bitcoin one bit.

In the past 5 years through the bailouts, asset swaps, and Quantitative Easing the inflation costs have mostly gone towards bolstering equity prices. Basically yes this is where the rich have/make the majority of their money, but you can get in on that too. I buy 100% equities because despite them being risky, they're protected by the interests of the whales who control the world and have vested interests in them. Too big to fail is alive and well, if you want your cut buy some of their stock.

Do you own a business? Ever send a wire? Yeah if you're just the average wage slave you probably very rarely need to step in to a bank, and pay hardly any fees anyway, so you likely don't see any issues with the current system.
Try running a business for a while and your perspective is in for a shock. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:24:53
Only so far. The whole premise of creating a new currency is that it can be completely disconnected from the current system. If the utility company decides to accept BTC as payment, fiat is no longer required.
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:48:12
And these buyers will do what with the coins? Sell them at market, spend them somewhere, sell them to buyers who otherwise would have gone to the exchanges... Either way it affects the market.

E transfer is only within Canada though, which doesn't help for remittance payments, which is where Western Union thrives.
Visa also started their Visa Money Transfer service which lets you send money to any Visa, prepaid Visa, or Visa debit card, internationally. But again the amount is limited to $2000 I believe. Still great for remittance payments, and costs $2.50 I think.
For me to send $3000 in bitcoin I need to send money to CaVirtEx - $5.00 fee - then buy bitcoins - 1.50% fee, then send (tiny fee) and the other end probably has to pay to exchange for their currency again. 
Where bitcoin really shines is in competition with wire transfers. It costs usually around $50 to send $10,000+ and there's always an exchange rate spread on top of that. 
@_date: 2011-09-05 17:42:00
Its true. This is the problem with underground markets. No regulation = no repercussion. Its just like mafia/gang/back market operations, you have to be damn careful, and you're going to get fucked over here and there.

Not if you simply wont give it up. Deny deny deny. I doubt they'd literally torture him for some bitcoins. 
Give it a few years, hopefully they hold steady or rise, and he can move somewhere that accepts bitcoins as currency. No need for the FIAT exchange.

I'm pretty sure you only have to report when you sell your commodity for cash and make a gain. If you happen to have bought coins for $1.00, and now buy something worth $100.00 with one coin, you don't have to report a $99 gain. The same would go for purchasing something with a gold coin.

Absolutely. Larger transactions between first world countries, most likely you could sue them. Smaller transactions or third world countries... just think of the Nigerian Prince scams. Good luck finding the guy to sue.
Make sure you would be equally comfortable sending cash directly to the person you are transacting with, or whatever escrow service you use. I have never heard of the companies/services OP mentions, but I would never trust most of my holdings to anyone except myself regardless.

I'm interested in the laser cutter. What did you use, how much are they, and how long did it take you to learn to do this?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:42:54
Exactly. There's no expectation that it should be perfectly stable, but most currencies don't fluctuate more than 1% against eachother per day. Once BTC settles in it should hopefully be the same, and the growth will be on a per year scale not per day/week.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:05:30
I bought 13 bitcoins back when they were $12 a piece (not long ago) but spent them. Didn't realize until now that I have 1.14 left... it was change back then but damn I'm holding on tight now, that's over $100 suddenly! If only I didn't spend any...
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:28:07
It needs adoption to be used as a currency, the process is slow. I spend bitcoin however I can, but the options are still quite limited. As the merchant terminals and ATMs roll out this should change quickly.

There would then be incentive for the whitelist followers to start mining and accepting their own transactions, probably forking the chain. 
Edit: It would take a massive following for their fork to hold any value. I just don't see that happening unless all governments mandate it.
@_date: 2013-10-23 02:36:59
You're right. It is inflationary until 21 million are mined, which is not happening in our lifetime. I think the assumption is that money will keep flowing in to the system faster than they are mined, but I'm not convinced you can rely on that. 
Similar to gold, we'll keep pulling it out of the ground, but the total and current supply are limited, and cannot be arbitrarily expanded and contracted as with fiat currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:54:56

@_date: 2013-03-28 06:08:03
Anyone expect something interesting at the $100 break point? I'm thinking a lot of people would place sell orders at that point, but likely some buy orders slightly higher. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 07:29:37
Someone should create an app/wallet that checks these things easily. I know blockchain has doublespend detection. There should be a way to display doublespend risk and why for a specific transaction.
I know larger transactions are more likely to go through even without a fee, and older coin balances are given higher priority, so it is only really tiny transactions you have to worry about, and they're generally not worth the effort. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:14:46
Cool, thanks for the detailed answer! How recently did you get this machine and how much work was it to learn? Do you create the design in a CAD-like software or what?

Escrow is fine, and still an option, but for merchants PayPal chargebacks can be a massive headache. Extremely common problem on ebay - customer orders product, pays using paypal, receives product, files dispute stating he did not receive product, paypal charges back to merchant. 
Same thing can happen with credit cards, and it is a risk most merchants would rather not take. Especially when your transaction is done in person. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 00:43:10
Ok granted, but I've taken this stance for years, its not like everything suddenly changed overnight. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:29:33
I think a better niche would be wire transfers - typically costing $50 at the bank and requiring all kinds of personal information to discourage money laundering... I'm sure the wiring of money for illicit transactions will be made much simpler through bitcoins. 
Not that this is a good thing, but it could easily inject billions into the currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:22:02
In that case, it wasn't so bad of an investment. If you had simply repurchased the bitcoins you spent to invest, you would have had the best of both worlds. They're two different types of investments - one relying on income, which is more stable, while the other relies on speculation, much more volatile. Overall the investment paid a return, in terms of dollars, which is still what makes the world go round regardless of what this subreddit fantasizes. I've done worse real investments, so I wouldn't call this dumb, just the cost of an experience which helps you grow wiser.

@_date: 2013-04-12 03:08:41
There's no reason the price per coin should matter, since you can own and transact tiny fractions of it just as well. All that matters is that the price stabilizes somewhere so that people feel comfortable carrying a balance, rather than exchanging it right back to fiat immediately.
@_date: 2013-04-28 20:05:02
While true in a sense, that's still no reason to let it go to waste. It certainly won't help further bitcoin's reputation.

One of the major risks of this market at the moment - no regulation means insiders can actually manipulate the market, and with a small market and a group of insiders easily owning a double digit percentage of it, this wouldn't be too hard. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:55:28
I'm specifically interested in the POS terminal. Sounds exciting and promising but a few questions...
* Does the incoming coin go to my own wallet, or one of your internal ones?
* Can the terminal still accept payments if your own servers/service goes down?
* What features does the terminal support? How does it look? How much will it cost?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:43:05
So, in other words, bitcoin isn't nearly ready for mainstream. Not even for nerds. Only for programmers and security experts who analyze the code for everything they run?

I see it as the opposite, since his buy would have to be higher than his sell to straddle. Everyone wanting to buy would buy at his sell, which is .00001 lower than his buy. If someone sold and then bought again, they'd buy at his sell, and then sell at his lower buy, profiting .00001

Sounds like he hit a nerve there. I think he was proposing that backup services may cost more than $1800, and rather than waiting for these BTC to be worth more you may as well just buy some more. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:11:15
Don't worry, the debit and credit card transaction fees are just being charged to the merchants, and being passed on to you as higher prices.

While the early adopters did mine most of the coins thus far, its still thousands of miners and we're only half way there, and most of them spent their coins and spread them around early, like the million coin pizza. I don't think there's as many coins in as few hands as you think.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:48:49
It gets tough to be patient when you think you're missing the bus. I was waiting for a dip but had no idea it would be this intense.

No different than the current financial system. Take the top few thousand richest people in the world, and its probably closer to 90% ownership of wealth.

@_date: 2013-06-14 01:45:34
Statistically yes, but its more like playing the lottery - you could win big or lose big. DCA will reliably get you closer to the average market price, which is generally preferrable to accidentally buying at a peak. 
I've been buying 1 bitcoin per paycheque, its been going quite well :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:06:52
It says for the quarter at the top - 3 months. ~10 Eur a month, I've spent a LOT more on trading and tx fees for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:07:09
The limited supply rate might, since there will always be lost wallets and keys causing some coins to be lost forever. I just wonder how much that effect will counterbalance the mining rate. 
Gold for example is used to plate electronics, and other manufaturing needs, and is often discarded afterward. That eats up a portion of the supply which keeps the price up... shrinkage is the only balancing factor for bitcoin's minting process once the market penetration peaks. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:39:49
Except that had they been using bitcoin this issue would not exist. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 20:38:07
That's the point - escrow can be used, but if the transaction is not so official, you don't have to worry about a future dispute. Similar to a cash transaction. Obviously the seller could still provide a refund if required. 
It just provides the flexibility of cash or electronic payment systems, as needed. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 01:13:07
Looks like they've moved a few times now... I sure hope someone is fiercely tracking this.

Not yet proven in court, but yes once something is included in a block (and a few further confirmations) there is absolutely no removing it from the chain. I'd see this as much easier to prove and harder/impossible to challenge as fraud compared to sending registered mail to yourself.

Thank you for that link, there are some very interesting discussions on both sides. One thing not addressed is the power of advertising. If Google, for example, were to create googlebux and (I know its not their style) shamelessly plug though their home page, chrome, and android for it, there would be more awareness within 1 hour than there currently is for bitcoin. I'm not sure the awareness of bitcoin has passed that critical mass that cannot be easily overcome.

Wow! It was just days ago that someone posted mentioning a need for this type of app. How long have you been working on it?
Just a few questions regarding its future.
Where are the keys stored? How secure is your server? - obviously don't say anything to jeprodize it but how can we trust your security?
I'm a bit confused with the fees. Why is it 0.0001btc to send to a friend, but 0.0005 to send anywhere else?
@_date: 2013-04-05 00:01:49
I'm trying to figure this out too. I'm assuming that the bitcoin holds a qr code of the private and public keys under the hologram of a wallet with 1 bitcoin. If you remove the seal you spent the coin. Otherwise you're trusting that there's still a valid coin under there and trade it in person for something of approx the current market value.

Wouldn't this just decrease supply and increase price? I've heard elsewhere that a single bitcoin is divisible enough to serve the entire population, and since they will continue to be minable there will always be one more...
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:06:02
The verification time is negligible when compared to banks 5 business day holds when clearing checks. Also a double spend is not practical for small transactions (probably anything under $1mil) and double spends are pretty quickly detectable. It is perfectly reasonable to accept small transactions with no confirmations, and for a larger one, such as a car or house, waiting for a few confirmations is no big issue while you're doing paperwork anyway.

Okay I guess it depends on your definition of stability. If we're talking about currency, look at the eurozone. Every time a sneeze is even theorized the markets go wild. Americans have this view of perfect stability because everything in the world is priced off the USD. Your $ is always worth 1$ but your food and gas prices swing around wildly. 
The value is not tied to mining prices, that's a reverse correlation. If mining is unprofitable, some of them will shut down until it is... the market will figure that part out. Right now the growth is simply increased adoption, which will eventually taper out. I'm not expecting BTC to become *the* world currency, just to be considered a small player in the forex world. Once adoption slows, and the market cap is much larger, a few million dollars in or out won't affect the price large percentages like it does now. The only driver will be actual demand, which should not swing wildly, but as you say there is no evidence.
I still maintain that the volatility will settle down, at least by a factor of 10, and at that point it will be more usable and trusted than many third world currencies, and therefore a valid contender. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:49:14


 
True, and many other cryptos have been created (look at btc-e.com) but Bitcoin has the first to market advantage, very difficult to take away. 
 


A "great deal" is subjective, but there are many services in place to make it reasonably easy. Eventually banks will catch on and create trusted services to help you secure your holdings, if that's what you prefer.  






While technically true, the potential is astronomically small that there will be a flaw in the crypto itself. All of the hacks to date have been due to security holes, mostly user error, or weak passwords. 




I could create a bank, use pooled accounts and fractional reserves, and pay interest. The deflation would make it especially attractive to the lender as the value of a borrowed amount will go up over time rather than down. Not sure that would catch on, but I don't see any good reason a credit system couldn't be built on top of bitcoin. 
You can invest it with anyone willing to trade it at par value for any other security. You can hire any employees willing to accept it as payment (tax accounting may be tricky though)




As does gold, or any commodity which trades internationally






Says you... I plan to spend my coins when they're worth a fortune. 




Yet... merchant terminals are just now being designed and released.






Or vice versa... grasping at straws now are we?

I understand that a huge factor in the value of bitcoins is its limited supply and slow and steady mining speed, so my question of this: What would stop the market from being flooded with different variations of bitcoin-like protocols taking over? Our faith in bitcoin is based on bitcoin being the one and only, but what is stopping me or any other institution recreating it, marketing it widely, and drowning out bitcoin's current top spot?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:27:21
This is a huge heist, and should be investigated seriously by authorities, if not only to ensure it was not an inside job. Stories like this do NOT fare well for bitcoin. 
If nothing else, the address where the bitcoins were transferred out to should be released, so they can be seen publicly.

I would hope he was smart enough to hold his coins in several hidden cold storage wallets, encrypted private keys, or at least strong brain wallets. I thought one of the main selling points of bitcoin is their potential immunity to seizure due to the nature of their encryption.

I'd probably hold knowing that it will soon be worth even more...

You're being way too focused on the situation right now. Bitcoin won't be doubling every month forever, it will eventually stabilize... though if it doesn't I won't be complaining. All of these problems are either short term, or have solutions that haven't been fully built and implemented yet. What has been built is an extremely robust infrastructure for the world's first decentralized international currency. The sky's the limit for what can be built on top of it, I don't understand how you can fail to see the potential.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:10:52
Keep in mind bitcoins are created every ~10 minutes, at 25 coins (~$2500) per block. That means there needs to be net inflow of $360,000 per day just to outpace the inflation. I still consider it healthy if the price remains anywhere near $100

You don't foresee going anywhere near a bank in the near future? Do you know anyone who could drop some cash off for you? Just send them an e-transfer. How were you going to send a wire transfer without being at a bank anyway?
I know it could be easier, but its only because of AML (Anti Money-laundering) regulations that the exchanges can't accept e-transfers, and because credit cards have risk of fraudulent chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:03:50
I've questioned that before. It's nothing like a Ponzi scheme, if you look up what that means, but I do question why it was made to benefit the early adopters so incredibly. The answer is obvious. Best way to get rich? Create your own money!
It being inflationary during his lifetime doesn't help him either though. If bitcoins stopped being minted today the value would climb much faster, though there would be little incentive for mining and the network would likely become vulnerable. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:48:42
To make your 'most important thing' easier, you can have your card automatically charge the full balance to your account on the due day. Just make sure to have a float in your account so you don't get NSF fees.

@_date: 2013-04-01 04:56:04
I'm just starting to understand.
So using this system, do your coins eventually get extremely fragmented? IE if you make many tiny transactions the change from each goes to a new address? But then I guess if I spend that change all at once it gets consolidated to the address I send it to right? Can I just send it back to myself?

Interesting. Thanks for this explanation, I'm still learning bitcoins and i've been obsessed for a few days now. I wouldn't expect the common user to ever understand this. So any transaction I do from my wallet sends the entire value of my wallet out. So if I had a million bitcoins and only want to send one, it will show as 2 separate transactions - one for 1, and another for 999,999? So really the large transactions we see may not be transactions at all?

DO NOT make your decision on a pipe dream to make 50k. Its possible, but not a certainty. Just consider bitcoin a part of a diversified portfolio, and keep some savings and mutual funds in your investment portfolio as well. Bitcoin is about it being a currency for trade, not a get rich quick scheme. 
Consider any money you put in to bitcoin money you can live without, that you won't be financially or emotionally hurt if it turns to dust.

'Pretty easily' meaning working up computing power greater than the current collective power of the network, right? Pretty sure that would cost billions, so they won't do that until the value is at least in the hundred billions, and by then it would cost even more. 
I figure China would be the most likely to jump in on that.

@_date: 2013-04-07 17:37:45
The thing about a deflationary currency is that there is no interest required. The reason banks work in fiat is that they can keep only fractional reserves (20%ish of your balance) while loaning out or investing the rest for profit, and pay you a small portion of that as interest. 
With bitcons I'm not sure that'd be possible, and taking a loan at even 0% interest would be super expensive at the unknown deflation rate... borrowing 100 bitcoins 6 months ago would bankrupt most people trying to pay back now. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:42:14

It has many limitations - you still need a regular bank account for one. Cost is higher. Can't send internationally. $1000 transaction limitation. Relies on a much weaker passphrase system.... etc. 
Sure its convenient and works well most of the time, but it clearly lacks many of the freedoms of the bitcoin system.
