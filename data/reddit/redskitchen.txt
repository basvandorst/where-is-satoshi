I haven't started investing yet. Is it smarter to wait until after that?

Does your wallet tell you how much it's gone up? Or are you doing the math yourself?

What's going to happen on the 9th? Will it be best to buy on the 10th?

Is it easy to move bitcoin from an app to a hardware wallet?

Hopefully someone can help me out! I'm new to this. I've been doing research, but I have some basic questions that maybe someone can answer. 
* Can I keep my bitcoin in Quadriga? Is it safer to move it right away into a wallet? Which wallets do people recommend?
* Is there a difference between physical wallets and one for android? Safety wise?
* Should I open a separate bank account just for Bitcoin? I've read stories of them 'freezing' accounts, etc. And is it safe to upload my photos through Quadriga+Equifax?
I'm sure these are silly questions but it would be great to hear some answers. Hoping to start with a few hundred dollars. I looked into Bitcoin years ago, but didn't think it would take off. Better late than never! Thank you!

Thank you!
Do you feel that it's safe for me to keep my bitcoins in Blockchain if it's a small amount? 
If it grows, is it easy to move that to a hardware wallet?
