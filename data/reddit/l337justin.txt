Not to ask silly questions, but my paypal account was one of the first permanently banned due to the involvement in bitcoins (even though it wasnt for a bitcoin2usd transfer, but for building a bitcoin mining machine).
Do you think previous paypal customers will be allowed back to use their services? I find it very frustrating that because of this my merchant ebay account was also suspended.

Since when could banks dictate what and how companies should act?

19 year old here who started his bitcoin adventures when I was 16.
What I found was the best was 2 options
1) Moneygram (CVS I had the best luck with no ID. Once at walmart I just cried emancipation and I had to pay a bill and was living on my own. They didn't seem to mind)
2) Opened a bank account with Wells Fargo (no age restriction) and linked my account up to Dwolla. Then I would transfer money to dwolla (direct withdraw) and then sent money to MtGox
If dwolla doesnt work out anymore (not sure haven't used it in awhile) there may be another outlet that will take ACH transaction for btc.
Hope it helps :)
//Edit: Ive used bitinstant by going to a local 7-11 once. Just showed the teller the receipt and they knew what to do. Handed them the money, received bitcoins relatively quickly. No ID involved.

I like it, it encourages the customer to go the extra mile for a 75% discount. 
Not sure if i'd ever download the product (me personally), but I know someone would

I believe you have to outline your ideas to gain the interest of an investor or a developer..

I used the "Moneygram" red phone in CVS, called in my order, filled out the form and gave it to the cashier with the money. Then I went home to marvelous BTC. :) No ID involved
