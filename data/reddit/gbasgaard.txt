Don't you feel better about yourself now? :)

Pretty much every comment I have seen you write has been extremely negative and degrading. I urge you to please be a little more respectful to people. Keep in mind that everyone is a beginner at any given thing at  the beginning of their education. Negativity will only scare people away from coming here to learn more. You aren't helping bitcoin or society with constantly putting others down. Just a thought to ponder...

Safe assessment I'd say ;)

Thanks for the advice. Glad people like to discuss things in a mature manner.

Coinbase will host your wallet for you. If you want your friend to send you bitcoins(BTC) on coinbase just go to Send/Request, then click on Request Money, don't fill in any information, click request money again and there's your BTC address.

Sorry for asking questions and trying to open up a forum. I'm even more sorry that it bothers you so. Hope you have a nice day.

Some people like to talk about things like that. I understand how you hate everything about them. I do and that's completely fine. Don't bother reading them then. I mean you knew what you were about to read when you read the title of the post. Don't bother clicking it then. It's as simple as that. Do you enjoy torturing yourself? If it's a hobby of yours to belittle others over the internet, then I don't know what to tell you. On a serious note, do you know where I could go to discuss things like this and have a worthwhile conversation/not waste my time?

Not positive but I believe they keep your purchases in separate wallets for security reasons. Could be wrong though.

Well seeing how a Bank of America spokesperson has said good things about bitcoin that seems strange.

I'll get on that. Is 4WD necessary?

Thank you.
