When you start by just leaving a  comment that says  “Holy cringe Batman” thats not giving balanced feedback, you’re just being hater at that point. 
Which is fine, but don’t leave another comment and make it sound like you’re trying to give me helpful feedback!!
Be true to you, brotha. 
My sincerity will probably get lost in emotionless text, but I really do wish you achieve your highest good, my man! ✌��

I am the creator of this video. Thank you for the feedback. 
I am getting from your comment that you just don’t like my personality. The content is ok, but if it was drawn out and low energy you would like it better?  That is fine, I do understand that will happen. My goal obviously can’t be to have everybody like me.  The purpose of these videos are to give clear, concise information in a entertaining and palatable way.  
There is no need for me to compare myself to a college professor giving a hour lecture.
I have several videos on YouTube that have taken me hours and hours to create, film, and edit. All my videos have nothing to sell or promote. 
For you to say that because my energy is high you feel I’m scamming is extremely close minded and unfair to the work I put in. 
It’s ok to not connect with my personality, but that would be the time to just move on. 
In a world cluttered by scammers and bad information geared towards taking advantage of people, it’s a shame to vocally hate on a person, creating good content just because you don’t like their delivery or personality.
Do you have a passion that you are creating content around?

All these bans are going to help the space!! Way to many scams and bad projects out there. Banning ads will limit the exposure these harmful scams get!!

There are basically two reasons to have a currency. To exchange goods and services or as a storehouse of wealth. Will btc ever replace the the dollar or any current world powers currency??.. maybe but probably not. 
It does have a great use case as a storehouse of wealth though. (Digital gold)

Forgive me. LVN is what I meant. 
It stands for low volume node. It’s a term used in volume profiling. The way I approach the market is based on auction market theory, order flow, and the volume profile. 
Markets have one purpose and that is to facilitate an auction.  The volume profile tracks every time a buying/selling occurs. HVNs (high volume nodes) are very popular prices and will act like magnets, while LVNs are unpopular prices and work as support / resistance.
