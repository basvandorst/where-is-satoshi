Thanks. Although mute also somehow fits in haha

Indeed. Free exchange was their big thing. Now they are telling everyone how amazing is free withdrawal but that's a spin
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:08:04
I believe they are trustworthy however in crypto you trust as little as possible. So use with caution. Their service is not bad however their new fees are ridiculous so check it all

In your link about capitalism it says that free markets are a feature of it. 
The fiat currencies like USD is considered to be the money of a free market capitalist country (USA). Now of course we know it's not really free in light of money printing and that's what Bitcoin promised to fix - an alternative that is more free and deflationary.

The current Bitcoin market cap is 9billion. So your point is mute. There's no perspective 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:06:27
I was excited to hear they removed the withdrawal fee, but in reality, you will not pay more because you will always make at least one exchange in their service, which will cost as much as their legacy withdrawal fee. So I think the previous fees were MUCH more interesting, now I see less value in their service.. unfortunately

Wow this is really unacceptable.. And your friend will never touch Bitcoin again. Sad

The price movement of BTC is always odd -
Fairly stable but with crazy swings every month or so. If you factor in that very few people own a very large chunk of the bitcoins out there, you can conclude that the market is rigged at least as long as adoption is still limited.
I was referring to the market in terms of pricing (exchanges).

May I suggest a donation to United Rescue, a volunteer service for first aid, which is operational in the US, Israel and soon in India 
Volunteers are called in for emergency situations and United Rescue coordinates it. It's the future of first aid

1) breadwallet for everyday spend
2) ledger for more secure vault system

1- the article you link is from a blog that brings accusations but no proof. I can post you an article that says 99% of diamonds are conflict-free:  That's also meaningless, since it's impossible to know with such precision. The fact is that if a company is caught selling conflict diamonds, they are put on trial and are out of business, since the US is extremely aggressive (rightly) about this.
2- agreed
@_date: 2015-05-26 08:31:11
don't forget to keep the secret key you got from ledger in a separate, secure place - not together with your credit cards
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:56:34
this is due to the extremely volatile national currency plus a big distrust in the corrupt government. this is actually a great scenario for bitcoin to flourish

Gold is a great store of value but why is it any better than silver, or platinum?
Gold bugs seem to think gold is the only really valuable asset in the world, but let's not forget gold is one of many precious metals.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:50:08
I know in theory it's possible, but I wonder in practice how often this is happening. How can I know the stats?
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:21:00
only for OTC products?
@_date: 2016-03-03 10:03:46
most ridiculous argument so far. He is justifying fractional reserves, which is the problem in the system
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:00:12
While I appreciate the good humor, I think you shouldn't promote the BTC ring by by employing false accusations about diamond rings.
Argument  Blood diamonds. Do a little research and you will realize that practically 100% of all certified diamonds sold in the US are conflict-free. It's the law and no one risks everything by using blood diamonds. And as another fellow aptly commented, if that's your accusation you will be accused back of possibly using "drug bitcoins".
Argument  It's easy to lose a diamond ring. That is true but that's why people have insurance, which will cover the full value of your purchase. In fact, that's a huge market - replacement rings. And if you use this argument, you will hear back that it's even easier to lose your bitcoins if you are not using cold-storage (most newcomers don't).
I do think the BTC ring can be a successful product but your marketing has to be more refined - focus on what's good about your product instead of throwing weak punches.
I myself believe that there's great common ground between bitcoins and diamonds, and I'm setting up a marketplace to shop for certified diamonds at wholesale prices legally, anonymously, with bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:52:20
If you look YTD (year to date), BRL is more volatile than bitcoins , but I can understand your argument.
However you have no point about bitcoins' "government" - there's no central authority. There is a market, and the players of the market have influence, but there is no central authority controling the currency. In Brazil, there is.

contact support. I had a similar problem - their withdrawls seem to be buggy but they fixed the issue in my case the next day
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:49:25
thanks for the detailed reply.
I think there's a huge opportunity for charging extra fees for guaranteed transactions - I've heard about this but Im unsure how this can be accomplished.
Let's say I want to transfer 1k, and Im willing to pay 5x the fee to get it done quicker, or even if it's not done right away, to somehow get a guarantee of delivery for the extra money I'm paying.
Because the 10 minutes wait is a pain for small transactions on the 500-1000 range: not a crazy amount of money but an amount nobody wants to gamble with.

bullies. I hate when companies use their size in order to intimidate others

Uphold has a very weak costumer service team (you fall between their offices in US and Portugal) plus they have ridiculous fees like this inactivity fee (from their website FAQ):
The following is a summary of cumulative fees that will be automatically collected from inactive accounts:
90 - 180 days: 1 USD per month
180 - 365 days: 5 USD per month
365+ days: 10 USD per month

The question that remains is how is their transparency section really transparent. Is audited? By whom?
If it's a scam, it could be they just added a few zeros in the "real time" transparency sheet. Meaning that they are maybe actually not solvent
@_date: 2016-02-14 11:13:37
I noticed the same thing a week ago, and they have to explain whats happening.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:05:24
I also use them often but this week I made a withdrawal to a bitcoin address and although the transaction was marked as completed, there was no money sent to my wallet address. 
I understand its different than your problem but its the first time I have difficulty withdrawing. 
In the bright side, Uphold responded rather quickly (same day), blaming it in some sort of malfunction and hours later the money was sent to my wallet. Frankly, they seem to be understaffed and thus unable to make sure the platform is running smooth - I think this would explain your case too. Notice they don't have a phone number you can call 
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:09:57
this is MUCH better
@_date: 2016-02-17 20:43:22
Precisely this last paragraph shows that they actually accepted the criticism of that Insolvency post. They discredited the poster, but they are redesigning the transparency page - meaning there was a problem here indeed. I guess the transparency page wasn't transparent enough;)
@_date: 2016-02-27 20:48:35
:D great

excellent writeup
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:12:33
indeed - it's great
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:27:54
for this amount i agree. its a different game.
but for the large investors, they are looking for non-manipulated investments. no one will invest heavily in a manipulated market since you are at the mercy of a group of manipulators (if the theory is right )
@_date: 2016-05-09 12:51:39
they are great but I also got a feeling they were not pushing forward. but that's our fault - the more people use it, the more they will expand 
@_date: 2016-05-20 10:44:29
you are assuming I'm attacking them. I'm not. I'm just asking if the numbers make sense, and that's actually part of the reason why they have the transparency page. Don't mistake questioning with attacking - if you can't take questions then don't bother with transparency.
So rephrasing the question, if they had 110,600,000 at 0.61 valuation, now that the valuation is 0.15 they should have 27,650,000. However, they only have 6,550,000 now. I guess people got out of Vox, rather quickly, to other currencies?
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:03:16
look here 
and then in their transparency page

Good write up
Ethereum lost me when they forked to save a broken contract. Yes I missed out in 3000% profit but the fact remains that their chain is centralized and less independent then bitcoin. But Bitcoin is not necessarily the safe haven, as it has its major problems too right now. I cashed out to fiat, but I wish there would be definitive fork in BTC so each side of the aisle can take their way and continue
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:18:40
that's why the average joe will not adopt crypto in the way it was originally intended. The average Joe might buy an ETF via his bank of choice, but this is nothing more than another financial tracker like any other. I think this is a very important problem to think about, if we aim to increase adoption significantly.
