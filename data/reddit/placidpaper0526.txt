This reddit is dangerous, all confirmation bias.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:30:44
HAHAHA he couldnt handle the heat and deleted his account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:10
Will it break out of this in a rally or a complete sell off?
What do you guys think, reply to vote
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:09:33
Nope, price is going to plummet here pretty soon.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:10:21
Same here, its great! 
So happy i sold half of my BTC and put it in XRP.
Waiting for BTC to tank further so i can get more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:52:14
I am about to dump everything, get ready for the drop boys
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:33
Good info, but this is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:40:35
b2x isnt even a thing lol, scam!
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:33:24
I DARE you to challenge me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:53:34
Haha, I never get tired of the coinbase scrubs.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:13:25
Thanks, mikeP this guy is about as clueless and salty as they come!
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:03:08
Going off of coinbase charts, absolutely hilarious - a testament to how new you are to this market.
Look at the entire week - christmas to new years.
I havent laughed this hard in a while.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:03:47
Nah, I am still hodling.
You all just hate any opinion that doesn't have "moon" in it.
Confirmation bias is dangerous.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:52:26
Its a big deal in south korea.
Get ready for the bears people
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:58:43
Get excited man, quit complaining.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:20:28
I bought ripple with all of my btc a few days ago, already looking at a 40% gain.
Btc is about to be a full on bear market.
Get ready for the whales dumping
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:18:24
Nah, i bought at 9k and holding, i did buy XRP with some of my holdings and im already seeing a 40% return on that.
Hoping BTC falls so i can buy more, like a true hodler
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:37:55
12k right around the corner boys! get ready to buy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:31:56
This guy needs to stay away from Bitcoin.
He should go back to sniffing wood and slamming can! Get out of here!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:14
Nah, its about to plummet. Wait for a better price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:38:53
Im sorry, but i dont feel sorry for all of you complaining about Coinbase.
After the BCH fiasco, you should have taken your cash/coins out of there immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:57:50
Hahaha, wrong again. Have you seen BTC on new years weekend the past 3 years?
Yeah, go look - then come back and talk to me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:46:07
Don't buy now, its going to plummet this weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:56
Shout out to the guys buying way above market value.
I SEE YOU
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:49:09
3 days to a year
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:32:12
I own quite a bit of BTC still, I would love to see it go up.
Its not going to right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:16
Here come the bears! 
We are no where near the floor boys. 
I am ready to throw money at my monitor
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:11:54
No, there is a reason that XRP is actually being used by big banks.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:24:09
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:03:46
Thats because the fork is a fucking scam
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:30
Looks more like 11.5 - but yeah its there.
Thing is, there has been 3-4 "walls" that i was confident in, these walls keep going down haha, today is interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:07:06
That wall is getting lower and lower, bears are winning so far.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:27:38
We wont see the real bulls until it gets lower, the price right now seems relatively high compare to this morning, people will wait it out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:52:59
Haha you probably have $20 in bitcoin, GTFO
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:54:07
You are an idiot. Trying to apply market trends and analysis to the crypto market. That is literally comical.
Like watching monkeys try to hump an acorn on a trampoline.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:55:20
Yeah, of course i have my wallet out this far in advance, i have a much of limit buys working right now, waiting for that sweet drop to 10k.
You all arent excited to buy more at a HUGE DISCOUNT??
Thought you all where holders, but i was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:52:33
Yeah.... 
You all get so salty when someone isnt talking about a moonshot.
Seriously dangerous confirmation bias in here.
You all only upvote and like opinions that involve lambos
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:21:29
Here comes the dump
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:21:40
LOL, I hope you are right.
But i just don't see why it would trade that high so quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:18:15
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:35:37
Okay? Are you looking at the chat? Or are you just another Coinbase scrub.
Its on a clear downtrend. Already back down to 14k
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:23:17
OMG ITS ON AN UPTREND ON THE 1 MINUTE CHART.
ITS GOING TO THE MOON!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:20:51
You really think its about to hit a new 24 hour low?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:42:19
Xrb is literally a joke.
Ripple will have much more real world use.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:50:57
Those are futures, not segwit2x.
Educate yourself before you make a fool of yourself
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:56:06
Been hearing this for weeks, Bitcoin craze is over.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:41:33
Honestly, what is going on right now?
Have not seen it this low since the BCH fiasco with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:47
Im doing the same, its about to drop so hard.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:01:04
What bullshit? I think the market will continue to do down. Am i not allowed to have that opinion?
Am i only allowed to post if i think we are looking at a bull market?
If that's the case, then this reddit/discussion is a steaming pile of confirmation bias.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:05:01
I think it scared a lot of holders/traders.
I don't think so much for illegal reasons - I'm thinking more scared about taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:54:58
bitfinex already down to 12.7K
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:28:41
Ripple is already being implemented/tested - xrb is piggy backing
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:04:30
Its going to keep dipping, with little rallies on the way down.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:23:44
How is that any more damaging than the people on here pushing BUY BUY BUY rhetoric?
No one gets upset about that?!?!
I know why, because you all don't like anything negative about BTC to be posted here.
And you want to talk about what is damaging to the readers of this daily discussion.
I'm done, you cannot be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:29
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:53:11
Not, its about to be 10k or lower
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:11:21
How am i pushing mis information?
I think bitcoin will continue to trend downwards for a while. Tell me how that is mis-information?
If i kept posting "WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON" i would be swimming in upvotes, this sub really is hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:19:03
XRP has been a fantastic hedge for me.
Has been full on BULL when btc is full on BEAR
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:12:33
You are ignoring what I am saying.
I want BTC to succeed, i just dont think its going to rally for a while.
You are just upset that i am not sitting here posting about how its going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:32:26
I love when people are in here using trading terminology and analyzing graphs like this stuff applies to crypto.... this isnt the stock market people...
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:48:02
Dont buy right now, price is about to plummet
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:32:48
You make no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:48:13
More coinbase complaints, haha. Get on a real exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:45:58
I'd say in the next month
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:35:21
IDK why you are using coinbase...... you cant even set limit orders, you just pay whatever they say the market value is. They are a broker, not an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:56:49
You sell it all?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:31
Coinbase is back up - wonder how this will effect the market
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:47:15
Back under 14k again. Stop looking at 1 minute charts and calling an uptrend lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:24:20
Buckle up, we are about to test that floor again.....
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:43:30
I mean we are looking at a major downtrend.
What is wrong with predicting that trend to continue?
Its just an opportunity to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:46:54
Yeah, ive sold a bunch of mine, waiting for it to drop lower to buy back in. I also bought a bunch of XRP with it earlier this week, already looking at a 40% return there.
So.... I am happy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:22
We are about to hit a new low. 
A ton of people selling off
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:37:34
GET READY FOR THE DROP!
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:59:57
A graph with trend lines?
Look at how BTC performed between christmas an new years last year, and the year before.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:22:28
Man, you must be blind.
