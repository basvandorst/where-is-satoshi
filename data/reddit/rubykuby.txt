You're actually fun at parties.

That fixed it. It was located in `~/Documents/.encrypted`. Moving it to `~/Download ` fixed the issue

The indie bundles do. There haven't been any indie bundles lately. I believe there are indie bundles every six weeks or so?

The fact that *some* altcoins are frauds doesn't delegitimise all of them, joke or not. Dogecoin is a good altcoin not necessarily because of its community, but also because no premining was done whatsoever.

Linux distributions. Nuff said.
There is nothing morally wrong with altcoins. They're forks of the Bitcoin source code, which is just fine.
There's no reason to fork the bittorrent protocol, though. It's working as intended. The only thing that comes to mind is using a different tracker where altcoins use different blockchains.

No. Ubuntu uses the Android firmware (sometimes, not always), but **not** Android userspace. It's a completely different beast.

If I were you, I'd cash out $5K. That way, you've lost nothing, and you can keep your other half of Bitcoins safe and sound.

Except on Android you can install any .apk file you want.

Thanks! As for answer three, I'd assume I'd have to send the funds from computer A to computer B, then generate a new wallet on computer A before I can send the funds back from B to A?
The password follows this logic:

Paper wallets are just fine tbh, and there's nothing wrong with encrypting your digital property. But enlighten me, what methods are you hinting at?
