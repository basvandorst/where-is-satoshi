You offered .5 btc, not $100 worth of btc, therefore you should give him the btc. Just look at it as if you had already given him the .5 btc at the time when you aranged it, that .5 btc was set aside, it still only costs you $100. Ask yourself, would it be fair to you if he asked for 1000btc because it had crashed instead?

I see a problem with agriculture: farmers work harder than anyone else, provide the world with one of the biggest needs we humans have, and spend their lives with nothing to show from it, other than a sore body and massive debt

The difference is, those transactions are trading the currency, not buying things, like paypals figures show

Not everyone, i come from NZ, were agriculture is our country, I grew up on a farm, i know alot of farmers, and i know that none of them are rich. Seasonal farmers spend half the year with millions in the bank, the other half with millions in debt. All non seasonal farmers are in $100k+ debt

Gold is a very important element, highly conductive so its good for electronics, it also doesnt react, rust etc, its very malleable, can be stretched super thin... its more than a pretty piece of metal, its properies make it super valueable, and its natural scarcity therefore gives it high value
