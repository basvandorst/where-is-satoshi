Most 7-11 and oxxo in Mexico actually take Bitcoin, thought it was pretty neat last time I went to not end up with a pocket full of peso coins after buying a water
That plus a bunch of exchanges such as bitso  or mexbt, and the only ones that really get affected become western union/paypal

They're slightly more related than folks on this thread have pointed out. Trump came out some time back threatening to block or heavily tax money transfers to Mexico (western union, xoom, etc)
This pissed off a lot of people that are already paying 15-23% taxes but cannot file an income tax return at the end of the year since they were using a fake social security number, now they'd be taxed again on top of that for trying to send money back home
Tldr they're related

I was sad to not see Doge clearing the jump, and flying to the moon at the end

What did I miss? What triggered all the changetips?

Take this as a grain of salt, but it could just as likely be that they dont have enough bitcoins to cover their balances - and not entirely his fault personally, but rather his fault for not posting their real reason for fuckup
The timing was too perfect from this post regarding a bug in a trading site's code, just as my gox was starting to go nuts..

Yeah, this isn't new either.. usually a style shows where it's from/purity to an extent... they've made pokeballs, blue whales, scoobiedoos, etc.

Exactly! Last time I went to Cancun/DF for a few days, I ended up getting *screwed over* by ATM fees (Wells Fargo US)
The thought of being able to bust out my cell and xfer some bitcoins to pull out at an ATM is just too awesome

I never saw the "original", and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Or maybe my bits are scrambled.. If this is a parody ad, did the original ad also have [ Western Union | Bitcoin ] and attempt to explain why WU was better? Or am I **way** over-thinking it, and the left block **is** the original?

This might get all the pitchforks pointed at me, but I think he means the fact that once stolen its rather hard/impossible for authorities to get involved. Yes, I know that's the nature of decentralized/anonymous... But I've seen quite a few threads with "I woke up and my bitcoins were gone", which unlike banks/CC won't get returned.
Just my 2 bits on it

TIL... Kinda tempted to point my laptop at mining these when I get home for a few hours for tipping fun (^_^)

You're absolutely right

This was more than likely someone who loaded the trading api and hit run on their code too early.
A couple weeks ago I pulled a git project from a few years/months ago and nearly did a similar goofup (on a much much smaller scale) of selling at $120. Basically the value was hard coded into a sample trade that back then would have never gone through because it was double the current price.

Those Vosto's are really damn solid.. I had one with a decent graphics card a while back I used to game on -- never had any issues for 2 years.
After than I've gone through an Asus G series, and lenovo Y410p that have given me more heat / wifi hardware / disk issues than I care to keep track of anymore

The price is simply a reflection of the large supply of boners in this economy.

Single large transaction from gemini or CB to any major bank.. banks have loosed up significantly on prematurely closing accounts buying / selling crypto
 he should be able to imo
