Where do you trade altcoins? I'm wanting to start doing the same

Fortunately for her, bitcoin appreciates over time. Hold, Sue! HOLD!

Nobody forced anyone to believe that bitcoin would be bad for big banks.
@_date: 2012-08-31 01:35:46
Are you saying that it becomes more expensive to write larger transactions as the bitcoin chain grows?
@_date: 2012-03-01 16:06:25
Same here.

Can you explain briefly what you mean by ATH?
@_date: 2011-08-30 19:44:29
Not technically the first since there is already one for South Africa. Definitely great to see this catching on. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:51:59
Very interesting. I think you may be right about that.  I wonder what kind of results they're expecting, though, if that really is their intention.

My advice as a young person in a similar situation as your son: DO NOT PANIC SELL IF THE PRICE DROPS A SIZABLE % IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS!! Do not let him panic sell if he sees the price dropping. The money is spent. Just keep the coins, and wait it out. He has to have some discipline for this as this is probably his largest purchase to-date. However, there are deeper things happening here than just price movements.
The Senate hearings on the 18th are going to tell us a lot about where the price is going over the next few months. Retailers and money transmitters across the country are waiting to hear what kind of language the Senate committee is using to gauge where federal regulators are going to be moving with this. We are likely in a mini-bubble and the price is going to reset back to $150-250 before moving back up. Nobody knows for sure where it will land, but the Senate hearings will give a good indication. If the hearings are positive, the legal teams for large retailers like Amazon and money transmitters like Paypal are going to be looking to start transacting in bitcoin and the positive media attention after the hearings is going to cause the price to continue to rise. 
Bitcoin is a new payments technology. As far as digital currency in general is concerned, the cat's out of the bag. The technology's already out there and from here on out there is always going to be a market value for a technology that performs the same function as Bitcoin (instant, near-free, digital cash transactions to anyone in the world that do not require an intermediary). Federal regulators are going to have to approach this in a way that takes that into consideration and not just harp on bitcoin itself. If the technology does not flourish here (because of harsh regulations that prevent US businesses from transacting in bitcoin or other digital currencies), then the technology is going to flourish elsewhere. Imagine a Chinese Paypal-equivalent that offers you and me the same Paypal-service, but in bitcoin, and does so at dramatically lower operating costs to themselves which they are able to pass on to us in the form of lower transaction fees. Or a new Western Union competitor that uses bitcoin to send payments internationally, instantly (instead of 2 weeks in some cases), and at almost no cost (instead of upwards of 30% for some low-value international transactions). 
I believe that the US government does not want to stifle innovation in the financial services industry here in the United States. They never have. I think they just want to understand it first and that is slowly happening.
Anyways. I think things will work out fine. It sounds like you're letting him keep the coins, which is great. Just DON'T let him panic sell if things go sour in the short term. Have him focus on the asset itself -- the underlying technology. He can assess the value of that and then determine where he thinks the price will go if things are looking up. 
Everyone regrets missing out on Google. People regret missing out on Microsoft's 60,000% rise. My father always regretted missing out on Home Depot even when friends told him it was going to be huge. Bitcoin has a chance and the upside is too high to regret investing a few thousand dollars at this stage. 
Anyways, good luck.

Write up a prospectus of the machine's proper function and its intended use. Include a link to a Genesis Block calculator showing the projected earnings from the machine at different Difficulty Values, one week out, two weeks out, one month out, two months out. Link to publicly available and trustworthy statements confirming all of the above. State that the buyer's expected ROI is going to be based on the Difficulty and other factors. Link to sources confirming those. Date and sign this document. 
Then call eBay **bold**tomorrow**bold** and just ask what else you need to do. Explain your situation and state your case. They will make a record of your conversation in their system. You can actually specifically request this. If the buyer ever initiates a claim, you'll have that record in their system and that will help you out a lot. A lot of these claims are resolved on a subjective basis. Do your due diligence and just state your case. Won't take long and it could save you a lot of hassle if a claim ever comes up. 
When you're done with this, send the buyer an email clarifying the machine's function and intended use again as you did above and say that you take no responsibility for their use or misuse of the machine and you make no claims about ROI or any other factor that isn't stated by any other publicly available or trustworthy source. Link to the Genesis Block calculations from before. CC ebay while you're at it ;)
Edit: And YES! PICTURES! PICTURES PICTURES PICTURES!
Edit2: By the way, this doesn't have to be long and elaborate. Best course of action is just to call eBay first and talk to them. Get a record in their system that you were concerned about it and sought advice for making sure everything was done properly and you were covered. Then you can write up something brief with the kind of citations I mentioned above and just send it to the buyer and cc to eBay and you should be fine.

Ukyo is processing all withdrawals manually on top of handling the rest of his business needs. He is working his ass off to make this happen for people. Everyone is going to get their money back. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 00:38:05


Do you have an update on this? How long did it take for the bitstamp USD withdrawal to your bank?  Thanks ahead of time! :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:37:05
Yes, I read that just a few moments ago! Sounds like things are going to go well. Can't wait to watch them live.

DO NOT ORDER FROM BUTTERFLY LABS. Do not under any circumstances give them money. You will NOT receive an item in time to achieve a return on your investment. 
Just read through other threads about Butterfly Labs. They are not a legitimate company. They never have been. Nothing they say at this stage will make that true. If they are not a "scam" in the technical sense, they are still unreliable. I have seen WAY too many people burned by them. 
I repeat: DO NOT under ANY circumstances give Butterfly Labs your money. 
[Virtual Mining Corporation](
[KNC Miner](
KNC has actually delivered working units on time unlike many other companies. VMC looks very promising but nobody knows yet how far out their delivery is. Cointerra and Hashfast... I don't know much about them except that Hashfast's delivery was delayed a bit. 
You have a very small chance of achieving a return on your investment if you are purchasing mining equipment. There are at least four companies about to put out a TON of mining equipment and this is going to drive the Difficulty through the roof. Unless you get a 28nm machine from one of the companies listed above, you're not going to get a return on your investment because your machine simply won't be able to keep pace with the rising Difficulty. Check out the [Difficulty/ROI calculator from The Genesis Block]( to get a better picture of this.
**Your best investment decision will be to buy Bitcoins and simply hold on to them. I really can't emphasize that enough.**
TLDR: Don't buy from BFL. Don't buy any mining equipment for that matter. Just buy Bitcoins and hold on to them. Check out the Difficulty calculator for the GH/s that you think you can afford and then run the numbers, setting the Difficulty to something at least 50% higher than it is right now.

Very good point. I half expect several family members to just shrug it off and forget about it after their eyes glaze over from me trying to explain it to them and why they should like it. 
There's a good chance that five years from now they'll have found the paper wallet crumbled up in the bottom of a file cabinet somewhere, calling me on the phone asking me to remind them how to claim the funds. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:50:34
Well, yeah, but what else is the buyer going to say except that he/she was misled as to it's use/function/benefit/ROI/etc? 
It's sold, but at the least the seller will have a record of their understanding of the nature of the sale even if it's after the fact. Maybe you're right though. I at least think the seller needs to contact eBay and just state his/her case and have the record made of their attempt to do due diligence. 
Edit: and hey: to the seller/OP: eBay customer support is actually pretty damn good. Sellers that communicate well do well.

There is always going to be a market value for a decentralized and digital means of transferring value at low costs. Whether it's Bitcoin or something else, it doesn't matter. 
What this means is that any regulations that the US Government churns out will need to address digital currency in general and not just bitcoin specifically. So the better question is how will the use of digital currencies by US clients (merchants and consumers) be regulated? Is the US going to universally forbid its merchants from accepting such payments from citizens in countries that permit their use? Very unlikely as this would create a huge competitive advantage for overseas merchants (banks included) over US ones due to the lower cost for payment processing. 
As far as your question is concerned, bitcoin and bitcoin transactions can't be banned anymore than cash transactions can be banned. If I wanted I could put cash in an envelope and send it to anyone overseas I want. Or feathers, or rocks, or tangerines for that matter, or any other commodity that someone is willing to trade an equivalent value for. Bitcoin can't be banned, but its endpoints can be regulated. Digital currency isn't going anywhere. The US Government is going to have to take an intelligent and measured approach to regulating the endpoints of this technology (where it intersects with the economy -- meaning how its transacted and recorded by merchants and consumers). 
I think we will all be very pleased with the Nov. 18 Senate hearings.

I would use bitcoin for every purchase if this were an option. There would be no disincentive to spending anymore.

Coinbase will sell you bitcoins instantly (i.e. they are immediately available in your coinbase wallet upon purchasing) and will debit your bank account 2-3 days later. Super simple. I love it. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:21:14
Add the card to your Paypal account.
Send money from the cc to another account you own or to a friend you trust and then have that friend send cash back to you. 
Then use that cash with Coinbase to purchase BTC. 
This is what I did.
