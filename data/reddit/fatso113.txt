The way the engraver worked was using Adobe illustrator and print from there. I can provide those files when I get a chance. Also, I started the project in rhino and had to move to illustrator since the machine could only read RGB

For laser engraving I would say always test your settings before you get into your project. I'm far from an expert or even an amateur but the lasers settings can make all of the difference

Very easy. Mobile verification (not sure why) and you insert up to $3,000 w/o ID. Very fast and hassle free. Will be buying more in the future

So I am not sure what happened to my Rhino file but here is the Illustrator file. It has different colors for the engraver to use. If you have a laser engraver that you can use I can give you the settings for the colors

I will have to go there tomorrow, I had no time when I got off work earlier tonight. I will keep you updated

I can send the files later with settings to use, I managed to forget my flashdrive in the lab after the finished product was done.

ASCII binary, couldn't really fit much in the room I was working with

Although that would be really awesome, it would melt in an instance. Instead, it's made with the next best thing... Acrylic, woohoo...

So I am not sure what happened to my Rhino file but here is the Illustrator file. It has different colors for the engraver to use. If you have a laser engraver that you can use I can give you the settings for the colors. I can make rough Rhino sketches and you can import them to Illustrator, they won't what the B though
