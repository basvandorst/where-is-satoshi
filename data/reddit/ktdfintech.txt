Yup do that crackdown after everyone has lost their money... Typical government response. A day late and a dollar short. They should just stay out of it.

We are 100% experiencing higher buy volumes. Our purchase volume over the last few weeks is up 150-200% from our normal volume over the previous months.

When we trade we basically act as an OTC desk and LBC is the escrow. I think the biggest benefit is people can lock in a price and get their BTC within minutes of providing their deposit. 
Exchanges require more time to get set up and you have to store your $$ with them before using it. We get a lot of customers buying from us through LBC in the US.

International wire fraud out of the EU is a big issue. Wires should not be reversed but you never know what your bank is going to do if someone crys foul on a transaction.

Stable coins, where are you located? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:06:34
Pretty much called it in that video.

We are a seller on LBC. We still do some KYC but we don't need your SSN. PM me if you are interested.

It will broadcast immediately. But will sit around until the miners get to it. Generally it takes 3 confirms to consider a transaction valid. So 30ish minutes. Sometimes more sometimes less. Feel free to fact check me.

We run an OTC desk and our price is dictated by market demand. We are always higher than exchange spot prices.

A sell limit sets the minimum price you will sell for. This is good in low liquidity markets where a market order may cause you to get filled much lower than you would like. 
A stop limit order adds a stop price to the mix. Basically once the stop price is hit, the order becomes a limit sell order with the parameters stated above.

You need to have both sides of a trade. This will even out over time. Also you are assuming that bitmex can influence other markets. They are a derivative product with a price pegged to other exchanges.

I believe it when I see difficulty start dropping.

100% agree. This is just the beginning

Bitcoin may become useless in the long run. There is a bigger picture here though. This isn't just about beanie baby coins.

The run from 3k to 5k. So many were waiting for it to go lower. Maybe it will.

They will not give up without a fight. Bitcoin represents a direct threat to the power they hold. You can bet they will want to keep that power
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:42:20
They are mad the missed the run

There is a wiki site that lists them all.a

Because the space doesnt have enough people against it. Let's fight each other too.

The coin that will overthrow Bitcoin probably does not exist yet. Like any evolving space the speed at which revolutions will take place will accelerate with time. 
Like the telegraph to the telephone to the cell phone to the internet to Facebook and on. each was spaced significantly closer to the previous. 
We are barely past the telegraph in my opinion. Anyone who was watching the internet be born would not have predicted this is where we would end up. 
The one thing that is known is that Bitcoin will remain a means to enter this space. So as time goes on more and more people are going to want through that door. From there it's anyone's guess.
