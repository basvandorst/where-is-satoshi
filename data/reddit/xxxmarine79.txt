This only matters to druggies. My theory is they saw him going to jail and they said F it and shut it down.

annoying... Now I just have to hope the market goes in my favor or stays the same. This shit is annoying, ugh.

Well nobody is perfect at it and you are still at about 4-5 times your money. Not too shabby.

Wow youve made a lot of money then even if you just sold around $100 or so. I sold and bought 2 times within the rise. Got out the day before the peak at $234 luckily.

Ive used bitinstant but those are $500 transactions at a time and its annoying I just wanna do one wire in. Dunno why its so difficult. Definetley a hurdle to consider when people buy them. Some people dont want to mask there identity when buying. I want to legit just trade bitcoins not use for SR or anything like that. Anonymity means shit to me.

hmmmm, I dont, Thanks for the advice though. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:47:54
They are leveling off now and go to rise again as speculators like me buy again. Get in now. Youll regret it shortly.

They are working out the kinks in the long term it will be more valuable than now.... For day traders this could be a great investment too.

So just keep going to different bank of america locations? I tried doing a wire transfer via my bank of america website and it wouldnt let me 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:59:36
Lol well now its not at $250 is it ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:00
Thanks yeah bitinstant by the time all is said and done depositing every $500 you end up with $460.... I wish there was a simple way.... Definetley a big hurdle....
