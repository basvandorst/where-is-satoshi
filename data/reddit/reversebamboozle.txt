Find a seller on Bitcointalk.org and exchange PayPal for Bitcoin.

You don't understand how patents work.  You can't patent Bitcoin and then stop people from using it.  It would never stand up in court.  There would be no open source projects if you could do that.

PR stunt from a PR firm.

Coinjoin isn’t going to magically make those coins clean.  It’s just going to spread the pain around.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:39:53
Why would Satoshi hire a PR firm for this?  Satoshi knows exactly how to reveal their identity in a way that leaves no doubt about the authenticity of the claim and it does not require a public relations firm.  This is very likely a public relations stunt.
@_date: 2019-08-18 01:25:59
You're going to need a lot more than that for 10 BTC.

Eat shit and die.

The idea that Satoshi would hire a PR firm to announce something they know exactly how to announce in a way that is indisputable is insulting.  We are talking about someone who conceived and helped build an entirely new form of money.  Someone who is extremely capable.  If Satoshi ever reveals themselves they will use the blockchain they invented to do it.

Wouldn’t make a measurable difference because XMR isn’t on most US exchanges and ZEC isn’t private by default nor do exchanges support its privacy features.  That’s not even a good argument for coinjoin or using a centralized mixing service.

Yang is way more creative than that.   Read his policies.

Nothing is a sure thing.

There's no evidence that any Bitcoin is being dumped.  Volume is normal.  And we don't need a million threads about the same topic.  Take it to the daily or one of the existing threads.

Why would anyone have hope for Libra?  What are you hoping for?

I have no idea why you aren't banned yet.  Your posting history is filled with stupid shit.  Go troll somewhere else.

I would stick to a schedule.  I used to try and time the market every pay check and I don't think I did any better then if I had just stuck to a schedule.
@_date: 2019-08-17 23:00:57
No and the PR Firm promoting this is doing a hilariously bad job of getting media attention.

You'll lose more through inflation than the bond will pay out.

Depends on the candidate.  Obviously a pro-bitcoin candidate could be good.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:28:04
Until it isn’t.  US exchanges are likely to use the strictest interpretation of regulations to limit their own liability.

My guess is that your firewall(iptables?) isn't allowing the non-default port.  The RaspiBlitz should have a safe mode boot option, figure out what that is as your next step.
@_date: 2019-08-18 05:24:00
Because it is bullshit.  If Satoshi wanted to reveal themselves they would use the blockchain they invented to do it.  They wouldn't hire a public relations firm.

Trump is the biggest enemy.

Lots of assumptions on your part.  Assumptions I don’t agree with. There’s also nothing you can say to me that will convince me that wallets like wasabi are not government honeypots.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:45:49
This isn't easy to answer because most new coins are mined by large pools made up of many individuals and people tracking this stuff are not sharing their data.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:47:25
Yes, there is no evidence that the Ponzi/CCP is dumping coins.  Zero.
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:29:26
That’s not really a scam though.  It is centralized and they do control the supply and because of that I’d call it a shitcoin since it doesn’t solve anything but not a scam.
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:46:23
You can import a private key using the Bitcoin Core reference client from bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2019-08-23 19:09:39
You seem to have an inferiority complex when it comes to monero.  You keep bringing it up.  Just because you can compile your own client doesn’t mean the precompiled apps aren’t compromised or that the back end isn’t tracking inputs.

It's the best way to build a team of cryptocurrency experts right now.

Too late, I did it again.  I can’t stop hijacking the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:55:28
Nice try, you’re just showing your manipulative nature.  Blocks are still the same size on disc.  We’re just getting more transactions in them with the segwit upgrade.
It also wasn’t the only reason since it also solved some other problems.
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:11:24
Centralized service that can track all inputs/outputs and you would never know and you people think it’s private.  Insane.
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:36:29
I hijacked the Bitcoin Blockchain to buy coffee the other day.
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:59:58
You are trusting them to run only what they publish.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:30:25
So you can’t show us the buys?  You specifically cited three 7k BTC orders, surely you can show them to us using market data?
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:34:38
The majority is very clearly not for increasing the block size as a solution to scaling.

Cash wins.  My dad talked a lot of shit about bitcoin until my brother cashed out some bitcoin in 2017 and gave my dad a pile of 100 dollar bills.  Now he’s pro bitcoin and always asks how the bitcoin is doing.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:39:22
No but stupid people like money too.
@_date: 2019-09-10 12:08:08
Of course you’re going to claim that.  That’s exactly what someone running a honeypot would say.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:22:55
Not proof.
@_date: 2019-09-10 04:00:19
Not by much and it wasn’t a rule that dictated size that changed it.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:24:56
Russia Today is not a credible news source.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:09:01
It should be easy to show us those 3 7000 BTC buys as proof of your claim.  So?

“Gold soared” LOL!
