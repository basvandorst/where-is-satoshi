Yep. They will destroy themselves, but not Bitcoin. What they're trying to do is to build onecoin like scam, but with bitcoin brand.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:39:31
This is sole purpose of BU. They're not going to fork, but they're creating more Bitcoin by dumping price of Bitcoin down. BU is here to create distraction in our community and making those perpetrators rich.
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:50:32
It just keeps exploding day after day.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:51:25
At least we're just dealing with rich clows. They have money to tune their shitty BU clown car but they're just stupid clowns. Maybe we can just ignore them and wait until they have blown all their money on their clown car.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:12:33
BU clown car just keeps exploding.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:13:42
What? Do you mean that those clowns are capable of repairing their exploded BU clown car. Now way, they're are just Dunningham Krugers with lots of money. I bet they're soon broke too.

Block size is same as always, people are not paying fair fees, BU is hostile scam that forked, blocks are more or less full.
Shits gone up and china has left the building.

Ethereum is bailout scam. We don't need that kind of stuff.
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:55:44
Hope... sure.
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:24:36
They're doing these stupid things on purpose. They're trying to break bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:14:45


No it's not. It's planned attack against bitcoin to break it's consensus and immutability. That's why we need to fight against it.

BU/Ver camp idiocy know no bounds.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:27:37
Lol... Or just end up being hobo.
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:39:17
China is cheap.
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:08:44
As far as I can see you had two sentences with question marks.
edit: there was three, but my answer is good for them. What comes for long term hodling: go for it, but learn about bitcoin first. Don't just listen random guys like me.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:16:13
Guys like Wang Chun are irrelevant. Don't feed the trolls.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:26:25
Cheaper and better is not how things work.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:26:05
I guess you're right; we should ignore that clown.
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:22:41
It seems that don't know when to stop.
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:47:20
BU developers technical knowledge is also non existent in field they're operating. Ver is just Jihan's smoke screen puppet. Useful idiot as they say.
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:05:49
Probably and that karma is coming from that sub. They just can't stand anything that's against their view of centralized bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:56:21
Run full node and signal UASF
@_date: 2017-04-14 22:22:42
People like Roger Ver is poison for our network. It's very sad but you need to ask questions like "Do I want to support network that one retarded 9 digit millionaire tries to control?" from yourself.
It's clear that Roger is stubborn and he seems to have sociopathic tendencies: he just can't change his opinions at all. We as a community need to go on and ignore people like Roger. He has gone beyond full retard and has no more or little ammunition left. He will ragequit sooner or later and Bitcoin will be better.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:39:49
One answer for your two questions: nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:50:21
Well... we can only predict future, but that's what I'm seeing.
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:47:00
Taxes are optional for Bitcoin user.
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:36:57
POW change.
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:45:33
Just wait couple of years and mining industry will be totally different. Bitmain will be distant memory and part of hostile entity along with Roger Ver in bitcoin history.
@_date: 2017-04-19 08:41:36
It needs to be ASIC resistant and we need to change it often to keep it ASIC resistant.
