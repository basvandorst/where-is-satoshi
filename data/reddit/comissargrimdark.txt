You might want to upgrade your Bitcoinqt to the latest version and see if the problem persists.
If you still want to ask for help rather than upgrade you need to provide information such as what operating system and versio are you using, what is the Bitcoinqt version and if possible give us the transaction ID that is causing problems.

When a bitcoin transaction is sent it is considered "confirmed" when it is included in a block on the chain. 1 confirmation is not considered secure as the block can be orphaned and the transaction could be superseded by a different one. 6 confirmations is considered secure and generally takes one hour to reaach this point from the first confirmation.
You don't seem to understand the blockchain model very well so I recommend that you read up on it before investing in ICO's

1. If she breaks the contract you sue her and receive compensation if you win the case and she has assets that can be seized by the court.
2. Make a notarized contract that states that both parties agree that the investment is valid if certain amount of bitcoin is transferred from address X to address Y in a certain time-frame, also an escrow service could act as a middleman if needed
Edit: To elaborate, the proof that transaction took place is in the blockchain, only point of contention would be whether the address the bitcoins were sent to is controlled by the party that is receiving the investment, hence the contract.

It's a obscure artifact of the bitcoin client and the protocol. In essence anytime you send bitcoin from one address to another the entire balance of the address is made into a transaction. The transaction is then split, the sum you are sending is split from the pot and sent to the receiving address. The remaining "change" is sent to a freshly generated key that is not visible in the bitcoin client. You still have the bitcoin but the address it is sent to is not visible, It can really mess you up.

itbit has a market maker.

A contract is a contract, you could draw up a contract that states two parties will exchange a bottled fart for a million dollar note and court would enforce it. Only thin is that the court needs to have jurisdiction.

I use  you can set the chart to display a custom time period to see what the past performance of BTC was.
Edit: Bitcoincharts is often down when bitcoin is surging due to people cheeking the charts constantly

If you think it's hard to get money into MtGox wait until you need to withdraw some, hope you have 3-4 months to wait around until they get around to your withdrawal.

Yes, the mining process is somewhat onerous though... [ass pennies mining how-to](
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:44:46
it's like giving away your wallet without realizing that you forgot your cash in there. All bitcoin applications should start suggesting the user make backups of his private keys if he/she has nto done so yet to avoid these situations.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:52:19
Where were you mining? Why did keep the bitcoin in a wallet that you did not controll?
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:08:26
Thanks, that sound like what I was thinking about, I'll check Electrum out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:14:33
Might take a few days to go through, it should od so eventually though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:55:50
It's just you, both bitstamp and MtGox are fine.

they sent me mail that my verification request was denied, since my documents were right I just resubmitted them and it was approved in less than 2 hours. I think if you get denied you have priority over those just submitting for the first time.

I used this machine a few days ago to convert euros to bitcoins on two occasions, the process was very simple and fast.
* choose language (English or Finnish)
* Scan address where bitcoins will be sent(the machine has a scanning window that you can see on the lower right)
* insert bills up to desired amount
* press send bitcoins
* receive bitcoins
My first transaction took less than 30 seconds from start to bitcoins in my wallet.

As I understand people are already talking about bitcents and we can extend that to talk about millibits, nanobits and so forth.

All traditional transactions such as Paypal are reversible, Bitcoin transactions are not. This is the reason that Credit Cards are not a valid payment option on any exchanges.

Read the article, it's not been confirmed yet. Still you know what they say; Buy on rumor, sell on news.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:02:25
PayPal is actively hostile to anyone having anything to do with Bitcoin. it is very likely you will not find anyone legitimate willing to accept PayPal transaction for Bitcoin.

Okay now for your next trick you can wait 3 months to get MtGox to wire you the money you just made. We'll be waiting to hear about this "awesome arbitration opportunity."

Set a password for the wallet, back the wallet up in different physical locations to prevent fires/natural disasters/water leaks making you destitute

I don't use electrum but the only really important file is the wallet.dat, that file contains the private keys used to controll your bitcoins. [Gandalf]Keep it safe, keep it hidden[/gandalf]

I'm not a big investor. I got in with petty change back in spring 2011. I've made a lot of money, on the order of half my yearly wage. It's quite enough to start worrying about a fire destroying my house or just a random HD crash. I've posted about this earlier but I was very inactive on the bitcoin scene after the summer 2011 crash and my wallet backup was almost non-viable(USB key that was only copy had developed bad sectors)
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:16:37
Oh you mean like the way the feds [seized]( 5 million dollars from MtGox. Bitstamp or any european exchange is better IMHO.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:21:42
if your password is truly secure then it's perfectly safe.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:32:25
Could you describe these issues? I was under the impression that the Lamassu machines were very reliable.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:24:17
You didn't put in a fee.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:04:25
Bitstamp, they have the third highest volume and have been around for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:15:17
Yes the return to "normal". Only time will tell if there will be another correction. I'm banking on no but then again I could be wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:05:17
Most likely a scam, no one wants to sell BTC with cc because of chargebacks.
