Also, do you have any advice on how to track your cryptocurrency?
As of right now I'm using [coin.fyi/]( but I'm not sure if there is anything better out there.

I guess I'm a little confused, like I said I'm pretty new to this.
My current plan is to buy about $1,000 of Cryptocurrency, split between BTC, LTC, and ETH. As of right now, from Coinbase I maxed my credit card investment for the week/month, $400. After this first $1,000 I'll probably spend about $400 a month on Cryptocurrency, again splitting it between the 3 for now ( maybe down the road I'll start doing more research in the smaller Cryptocurrency).
I am then going to link up my personal bank account and deposit $600. I already deposited $200 from my checking account, but I'm also going to take $400 from my savings account. 
I saw that Coinbase was a good place to start, so I'm a little confused about the GDax and other options.
Like I said moving forward I'll probably have the extra cash in my checking account that I'll be using for Cryptocurrency.

I guess say I buy 1 BTC @ 16,725.30, is there anyways I can see/track it's growth in 1 week, 1 month or 1 year?

Random question.
As s brand new user to Coinbase, and cryptocurrency. I linked my bank account to my Coinbase account. I then proceeded to buy ~$200 of LTC. It says it's going to take 6 days to transfer the funds. 
My questions is do I get "locked in" to the current price that I bought the LTC at?
 So say when I bought **+1.05941339 LTC** @ **$187.84**, am I locked into that? I just haven't got the LTC in my wallet? 
So I will get the **+1.05941339 LTC** in 6 days, but if the price goes up instant profit? Or if there is a lose in 6 days I'll have a lose?
But in 6 days I'll be guaranteed to have **+1.05941339 LTC**  in my account?
