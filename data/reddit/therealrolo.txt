Where are you getting this 18,000 number? Plus isn’t LN only on the test net right now?

What’s your point? are you comparing a free and unregulated market to rape?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:47:51
No, in order for a trade both parties need to agree. Just because you feel that your Euros have value doesn’t mean that a Walmart in Mississippi will accept them.

How much data is your nose using? Mine only averages about 1 Gb a day.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:49:36
Maybe there is something wrong with my nose then I only see about 9-12 other connections at a time but it seems other people nodes can have up to 50.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:51:19
Until Core gets off their asses and implements SigWit we won’t see others adopt it. I’m sick and tired of blaming everyone else for Bitcoins problems.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:47
No, complaining about insider trading gets the government involved.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:34:54
My speed is less than half of that and I am running a node off my Raspberry Pi without a problem.
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:10:04
How do you steal something that isn’t owned by any one?
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:05:55
I never said it was 50/50, you are just arguing over semantics.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:14:30
Because then this sub would have nothing to talk about.
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:29:53
Or we could just stop taking about it.  
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:16:54
Why would I want to run a full node on my phone?
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:39:00
Thats because r/btc isn't just a Bitcoin Cash sub, its for discussion for all things related to Bitcoin \(Including its forks\). r/bitcoincash is the sub dedicated to BCH.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:11:49
It depends what metric you use to define centralization. The most common metric would be hashrate distribution in which case the top 3 mining pools make up over 51&amp; of bitcoins hashrate. Another common metric is the number nodes and Ethereum has almost twice as many nodes as Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is so new and such a small percent of the population uses it I don't think it can be considered decentralized yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:24:46
It doesn’t monitor anything it’s just an animation.
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:11:57
Before this sub became about memes it was a place for disscussing Bitcoin and things related to Bitcoin. The big block supporters were at war with the small block supporters but when the UASF(SigWit) started gaining tracktion on this sub big blockers were driven out and formed Bitcoin then split into Bitcoin (SigWit) and Bitcoin Cash, the big blockers adopted Bitcoin Cash eventhough they already made a home in @_date: 2018-05-12 15:18:14
It’s a crypto currency forked from the original Bitcoin code. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:48:35
Do you even understand what segwit is?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:34:25
OP was using a credit card not a bank transfer.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:10:52
Exactly, that's why the fork was called off.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:50:46
Why would they apologize? and to whom? They were continuing with the second half of the NYA that was made months in advance. It wasn't a surprise, they made their intention to fork very clear. Forks aren't attacks they are a defense mechanism that insures the survival of Bitcoin in the event of the network being compromised.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:50:20
Damn that is petty, makes the crypto community look a bunch of children.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:17:46
Are you trying to spread FUD or just ignorant? The app creates wallet that lets you store bitcoin just like it says, be it BTC or BCH.

On what grounds? He legally owns the domain and has the right to do what he wants with it.

Who ever thought the winner of an election could collapse the stock market is an idiot.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:16:59
Exchanges don’t care how much fees are because they will pass that cost on to the customer. That is why it took so long for them to implement SegWit and batching.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:16:47
There is no such thing as a “spam transaction” if there is a fee attached. The txs with the largest fees will validated and added to the blockchain. That is the way BTC is designed.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:52:18
No, that was just 100 billion.
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:41:28


So...all of them?
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:39:53
Satoshi used the word mining to indicate that the coins are not created but rather are discovered through math and cryptography. In other words all 21 million coins already exist and more can not be created. If Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be treated like gold he would have called Bitgold. Traditional money can be thought of as a spectrum between spendable and store of value. Cash is very spendable but not a good store of value but the opposite goes for gold. A coin is a cash and gold hybrid meaning that is easy to spend but remains a store of value due to its rarity  as it requires something rare to make it. This is why satoshi called it Bit*coin*, he wanted it to be both a store of value and a currency.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:05:23


Did you even read mine? I was answering *your* question. Satoshi used ‘mining’ as an analogy to explain the hashing process and had nothing to do with bitgold.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:26:22
So lying. buy(dot)bitcoin(dot)com takes you to a page where you can buy Bitcoin Core. There is no way you can be stupid enough to accidentally buy Bitcoin Cash with that link.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:48:12
It’s like going to a Hyundai dealership and being mad that you didn’t get a Honda. You can’t sue someone because of YOUR stupidity.

How much of the world economy is tied to metals? Isn't the whole point of fiat that it is physically backed by anything?
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:54:49
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:41:04
This sub apparently thinks it tricked miners into activating segwit
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:18:15
No LTC is an alt coin
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:41:25
I'm still up 12% since last month so I'm not worried.
