Exactly, this debate between the two has gotten so bitter that both sides are just demonizing the other - a technique that ISIS uses to make their fighters hate the enemy. This is what makes this debate terrible and also this is exactly what American politics are suffering from right now.

Please tell me that you're joking and that this joke went woosh over my head.

I think that saying that BU software has backdoors is a bit strange. Is there any evidence of this?

You can't be hacked if you secure your coins the right way. Also many things of value are backed by nothing much such as gold or other metals. When banks make their own cryptocurrencies, they will probably not make it decentralized. So people will probably still have reasons to use non bank created cryptocurrencies. Jordan Belfort needs to actually research crypto before he talks about it.
