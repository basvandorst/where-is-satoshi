This is a really cool idea. I cant wait for this to happen.
Although as its a business, what happens if the payment has been made from proceeds of crime?
Also, Im just wondering, I read another post about a node operator unable to withdraw funds from the lightning network, is this the same for businesses who need to withdraw btc and pay suppliers in fiat? Sorry not been in the btc space for a while. Thanks

Last weeks Keiser report states that global trade in the stock market is at a low. Nobody has any money to invest. Bitcoin hasnt taken off as whole populations dont know of its existance. Wait for the next financial crash, then you will see expensive bitcoins. 
Just my 2mbtc.

They make money from the exchange fees not mining fees. I spoke to various cex.io/ghash.io employees about many things, over the last few days at Insidebitcoin. Their attitude towards 51% attacks is genuine, but they are now looking at discusfish as the main threat to that. I understand they will be offering mh/s for scrypt soon also. They seemed like really nice people.

I bought coffee and orange juice with bitcoin in London, back in 2015. I scanned a QR code and it was confirmed in a very short amount of time, maybe 10 mins. I have never been back to this shop and the majority of my btc purchases (sweets, honey, t shirts, gold/silver) have been one time purchases to support companies using bitcoin. 
Looking at your infographic, do I have to set up a payment channel every time I interact with a new company/supplier? How do I do this when I buy a coffee in a new place which accepts btc? Surely the QR code method was faster and involved less steps and knowledge. For example cashiers would just offer a QR code rather than having the proficiency to set up a payment channel for a one time payment.
Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, I havent kept up with bitcoin progress lately.

block size needs to increase to allow "spam" transactions. this needs to be done soon otherwise we're fucked. these "spam" attacks just show how the network cant handle the amount of transactions being sent.
also the cost per tx is too high at 2p per transaction.

TBH I have literally just withdrawn my btc from BTCJAm because of the lack of security concerning my investments. Borrowers seem to be able to get away with BTC for free. There seems to be no way to collect on the loan after it has defaulted and all the "references", including the social media link,  seem to amount to nothing. 
Also NO FORUM????????????????

I looked into this after last years inside bitcoin conference. Its very difficult to do. You need to bank outside of the UK. Get all sorts of licences. Renting locations with high foot fall. Then the machines are very expensive and one drop in price can ruin your spread unless you can find a way to link the machine straight to an exchange or have someone online to replenish machines of coin stock when they deplete. I understand one way around the legalities is to set up a business selling "magic cows" or some other digital asset. The "magic cows" just happen to be bitcoin. 
Unless you have a machine that works with GBP, converting many of the machines on the market is impossible due to the fiat note intake varying in size throughout the world. GBP has a larger note size.
If you can make your own machine that takes GBP the start up could work if you can distribute throughout the UK. Limit the costs. Otherwise your are laying out a significant amount for any machine that is slightly worthwhile.
I think BTM do have a long term future but they need to be able to sell more than just bitcoin imo.
If I can grab btc from a a machine with a low spread I will do it just to save my money. there are no minimum transfer amout to BTMs. i suppose i could use bittylicious to buya tenners worth but usually i have to trasfer &gt;£500 for no fees.
BTMs need to be in every city for mainstream adoption. 
good luck

As a UK citizen i wrote to the Treasury and told them what was going on with bitcoin during their "Call For Information". It seems if you want them to understand, YOU have to write to them and get those brain dead idiots to understand that if they are slow they will fuck things up for USA. Personally i think you are fucked anyway. Your representatives are worse and significantly more dense than ours.
