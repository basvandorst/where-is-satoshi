This is awesome.

We'll write long blog posts and then all you have to do is turn them into 4 lines. It's an excellent idea! COME ON
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:55:15
This is awesome though: 
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:03:09
Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:38:53
What should we post about next?
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:47:44
p.s. All four of those companies are funded and working full time to solve these problems. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:00:31
What if we had Twitter login?

At least a million million as long as you keep the quality high.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:10:53
You should probably write ZapChain blog posts from now on. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:09:17

@_date: 2014-09-04 19:02:50
We understand the Bit.ly comment, we mainly wanted to see how many people were clicking through :) 
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:38:43
Excellent! We're so glad you enjoyed it.
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:54:07
Woooo!!! :)
@_date: 2014-08-18 04:08:30
List of companies? We could do a post just on these. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 12:00:05
There will be Twitter support / we would love to have you as part of the community. Let us know what you find out. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:57:43
Verified. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:42:53
We agree, we definitely want to enable everyone, even if they don't have a Coinbase account, to receive tips. This is something that we are working on.
We're super excited about tipping, this is only the beginning :)
p.s. We are working very closely with Coinbase, to the point where we are emailing with them at least 10+ times a day (sometimes in all caps...because...we got excited). They have been incredibly helpful and receptive to the feedback we pass on from you guys. We want to make this awesome :D
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:33:03
Tell us how to make the site better! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-08-13 21:56:49

@_date: 2015-01-14 23:59:01
Hahaha, yes, this. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:48:05
We have started using the "Ƀ" on [ZapChain]( 
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:43:22
Like a safe/welcoming social network for gamers?

If you are just learning about the CoinTelegraph situation, this is what is happening. 
1. [CoinTelegraph]( is a large bitcoin publication that refuses to reveal who it's owner is.
2. We rely on journalists to tell us the truth without being biased. If we don't know who owns the publication then how can we trust that they are not biased?
3. As a community we are working to find out who owns CoinTelegraph.
Common questions: 
* Why are the founders and investors of CoinTelegraph so keen on keeping themselves hidden?
* Who is currently the CEO of CoinTelegraph, Toni Lane Casserly or Maria Jones?
Recent public discussions about the CoinTelegraph situation: 
* [Who owns and runs Cointelegraph? Where do they get funding from?](
* [Who owns CoinTelegraph? Is it the second biggest mystery in bitcoin? \(Number one being: Who is Satoshi?\)](
* [\[video\] Who owns and runs Cointelegraph? -- MadBitcoins Live with Ian DeMartino](
* [Toni Lane: I am the CEO of CoinTelegraph. We are looking to expand our publication. Which countries should we expand to? Why? Would you be interested in helping run a local CT office?](

Place to talk about bitcoin with experts in the space. Very regularly see engagement from top companies / people in bitcoin. Nobody is anonymous.

You guys rock, thank you for all the supportive comments regarding this video (and our other videos). 
Honestly making videos isn't our core focus, we mainly focus on building out the bitcoin community on zapchain.com, but as long as you guys like watching them, we'll keep making 'em :)

[Nick's answer:](
"The first wave of merchants who have added bitcoin are doing it for PR and brand recognition and to acquire new customers from the bitcoin community. That wave of merchants is continuing, but slowing down because PR is not sustainable and the "first-mover" advantage no longer exists in a lot of segments (travel, non-profits, media, consumer electronics, etc). A year ago, it made a big splash to be the first large comapny to accept bitcoin in any segment- you'd be the first in your segment and gain thousands of loyal new customers. I think we'll continue to see that happen in new segments, but there's simply fewer of those segments today than there was a year ago (hence the slowdown).
The most exciting long-term benefits of bitcoin are the cost savings. Bitcoin is going to be compelling to large merchants for cost savings only when the userbase is large enough to really impact their bottom lines. New user adoption is key for this. From my view at Coinbase (and you can see from Blockchain.info's charts as well), new user acquisition is growing quite fast and its only a matter of time before the userbase reaches a point where cost savings will really move the needle for large merchants."
