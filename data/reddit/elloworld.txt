how much for that 6950?
@_date: 2011-06-10 13:33:46
including or excluding shipping? I live in the states, California. I want to take you up on that offer.

yeah i've been using them for a few months ago. With past fiasco's I'm obviously fairly skeptical of any hosted web wallets(keep most of my coins offline) but they seem to be secure and professional.

You can always try localbitcoins and see if theres anyone selling in the area .

Not because I'm high, but I first used and got interested in Bitcoins because I've used the Silk Road in the past.

Lol India is less of a democracy that america and that's saying something.

always a bit sad to see the anarchist symbol and name shat on by these an-caps

This is what I thought of when you said bubble has just pooped.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:02:13
you need to create a worker on the online bitminter site. should be under "my account" and then "workers"...have fun!

What happens when as asicminer/shareholders start cashing out their coins? Obviously friedcatz took care to not get 51 percent of the hashing power because bitcoin collapsing would destroy everything he's worked for, so he's not going to dump them,  but won't there at least be some downward pressure on the price?

thats about what i get with my 6850. You'd have to be pushing that thing extremely hard to get close to 250. If youre looking to make it dedicated(not using the computer for anything other than mining) and you're willing to overclock, you can get closer.

I have a mining operation in San Diego, but I'm guessing I'm a little too south.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:42:55
No you should have a separate worker for each GPU

how do i get in on it? send my btc to the address and just post with the details of the transaction?
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:09:43
depends on if you have overdraft protection or not
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:36:34
they give you an exact number to deposit that is unique to you, like 206.63 cents

ill take 100,000 satoshis for an honest review
