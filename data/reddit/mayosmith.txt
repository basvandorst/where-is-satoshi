It takes about 2 weeks to mine 2016 blocks. A sycamore-like processor could mine 2016*12.5 coins in a few seconds (I realize there's lost of debate about that, but not out of the question). At the 2016th block the difficulty adjustment would go sky high. Conventional Miners could take years to mine the next 2016 blocks.

Ok. Got it.

Got it. Thanks for clearing that up!����

Okay everybody, completely on board! Thanks for the education!
Here's what I think we can say: a sycamore-like processor could mine 2016*12.5 coins in a few seconds (I realize there's lots of debate about that). At the 2016th block the difficulty adjustment would go sky high. Conventional Miners would take years to mine the next 2016 blocks. 
We'd be stuck with the quantum computer.

Who else agrees?

Sycamore-like processor probably could but it would get stuck after 2016 blocks.

Agree.
