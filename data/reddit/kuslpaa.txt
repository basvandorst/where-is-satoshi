Aaa... Indeed! Living paycheck to paycheck is something that is something where store of value doesn't really matter too much. For example, Venezuelans (as I imagine) don't really care about the long-term store of value (SoV) aspect as much as they do for the short-term purchasing power (which of course is short-term SoV). Also p2p aspect of Bitcoin comes handy I'd imagine.
I have also experienced time and time again when I have tried to explain my fellow Finns (insert your average blue-collar worker) about the power of Bitcoin, but no-one really cares. Then again there are other factors I can see that influences partly on their ignorance.
Again, this goes to show the many perspectives that every individual has one Bitcoin. Age, gender, nationality, time, place, and all those other contextual factors lead to different perspectives. Thanks for showing this one for me! Everyday I learn more.

Biased sample because the followers are already more interested in Bitcoin. This poll doesn't contribute in any way or form to reality.

"Is it functional" for the third one. Then you'd get a nice row of 'yes's.

Hmm, are you sure? What if I mediate knowledge, enthusiasm and basic skills that then affect a person who might support the technology you are so much in favor of? And by the way, you are missing one crucial fact: Bitcoin isn't about technology per se. If you take a wider perspective, you'll see it is more about a cultural and social paradigm shift than anything else.

I say this is the most accurate, yet concise evaluation without bias there is in this thread.

If we apply the 1% rule of internet, then I wouldn't worry about the noise you see on social media platforms. So, Hakuna Matata dude. Who the fuck cares what the 1%, or the blabber mouths say. It is not like they are the developing or actually contributing in a meaningful way.

I think that is where "stack sats" stems from, but I might be wrong. It is easy to grasp the unit Satoshi now when 1 bitcoin itself is so expensive. Makes more sense to speak of satoshi than bitcoins, therefore: yes is the answer to your question. You can afford millions of satoshis, but maybe not that many bitcoins. :)

Noice! Something like this I have been looking for some time! Thanks stranger!

Thank you for sharing! Very educational.

I came to a similar conclusion myself a few days ago. Unbelievable!

There are ~[4 500 million ]( internet users, around 58% of all population. There are very [little active]( bitcoin users, only under 30 million.
There are ways to go, but I am hopeful for the people who desperately need bitcoin.

Genuine question: I can get a pretty hefty student loan where I live, with a very little interest rate (around 0,1'%). Do you think that is wise to put it in bitcoin and wait for 4-10 years? Would you do it?

Thank you for bitcoinrabbithole link. Everything else I have pretty much devoured. xD
