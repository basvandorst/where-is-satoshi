I have very little money invested in Bitcoin right now. Enough that if it continues to climb, I'll be happy, but if I lose it all it's fine.
Thanks for the info. Things seem extremely volatile right now, but I have faith. Even my 60+ year old dad has heard of Bitcoin, which is *very* telling to me as he's not a big internet guy.

Unfortunately, I was unable to get it to work. After playing around with it, it looks like I did find the private key, but there were zero funds in there. My guess is that the owner of the bot took all unclaimed funds when it went defunct and moved them elsewhere. Unfortunate for me, but it is what it is and was worth a shot.

I bought a small amount of Bitcoin for the first time today (like, a fraction of a BTC...). In about 4 hours I've made back my transaction fee and I'm up a couple bucks over my original investment. What even is this?!

Thank you very much for this info. I'll give it a shot and hopefully I'll get lucky!

What happened in December 2013?

I have a question...about 4 years ago, I received a bitcoin tip from someone, and the transaction was facilitated by a bot, specifically which appears to now be defunct. I have a message on my Reddit account and in that message, I have a bitcoin address and a hash 160 number. I'd like to move those btc's to a wallet (Coinbase), but can I accomplish that with just that information? I'm assuming not, but I'm very new to all of this and want to see if there's a way to receive those bitcoins. Thanks!

Because being a Reddit user isn't a prerequisite for owning and/or being into Bitcoin?

TREE FIDDY!! Haha...thank you so much! Now I *have* to get myself involved and learn all I can about BTC.

Yeah, but I don't have the $230 right now to buy a couple coins. I'll start saving a little on the side though in case something lucrative happens soon.

Thanks for the info! I'll read through that wiki!

I, like many others, just really started learning and understanding BTC yesterday with all the front page hype of the crash. I have not bought in yet and honestly don't know where to start (I know there are links with all the info in the sidebar, I just haven't taken the time to read through it yet). What this post tells me is that history may repeat itself and I would be wise to *not* buy in at this point, but rather give it a few months to cool off and see where BTC is. Just like those that buy in now, what I'm doing is also a risk. I could buy in now and lose my shorts, or I could wait and it could be $350 or $400 by Summer and I've missed my opportunity. Either way, it's fun to watch and I'm going to sit idle and hope I can get in at a much cheaper price point in the near future.
