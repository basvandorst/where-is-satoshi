Try out a different exchange like Gemini, or better yet, if you're really pressed for time, try out LocalBitcoins

Thanks for sharing! This is awesome

If your risk appetite is there, I'd even suggest buying a small bulk to start off. This is the correction most people had been predicting and what they meant by "buy the dip".
Historically, there's been a pop after Memorial Day weekend, but that comes with the caveat that no past performance guarantees future performance :)

At this rate, we should go at $500 increments

I'd say nearing the end of early adopters. Which means parabolic growth right up ahead!  :)

Time to fill the front page with this guy

The fact that we're seeing some very strong support at 2400-2500 is a good sign. There's a decent chance for prices to get back on the upswing in a few days once Coinbase / other exchanges get their shit figured out and all those new users can finally buy.

Aside from the actual financial value, the intrinsic value of the network increases parabolically.  I like to think of bitcoin as the "email of money": decentralized to the point where it's impossible to kill like email.
Getting rid of bitcoin will be the equivalent of trying to get rid of email today.  Bitcoin is here to stay which means the only other possibility is price going through the roof!

I'd recommend LocalBitcoins with cash for maximum privacy

The surest way to lose is to materialize losses. When you panic sell, it becomes a 100% real, empirical evidence that you lost money because of your incompetent trading.
There's a reason why it's called discipline. You have to fight your instincts saying you should sell because the price is going down. The next level of nirvana is choosing to buy even more when the price goes down.
The first crash is always the hardest. It's the most likely time in your life you'll make some very, very stupid mistakes future you would be cringing. Listen to the wise old men of and HODL!
It's funny the secret to making money with Bitcoin has been on the frontpage for so long and people still can't do it.

We were at 2500's for what, 3 hours?

A friend is still stuck getting verified while Coinbase was down. He's been screaming at the screen for it to go through before the price pops back up.
Made me think of all the other new buyers held up by ACH arriving / laggy exchanges / divesting from other investments who are looking to capitalize on the dip.
I'm feeling bullish that we've hit a strong lower price support and we'll be back riding to the moon very soon

You're right, that's the tough part. it's trying to beat that FOMO of a lower price that prevents us from buying when we should've.
My criteria is the fact that I'm saving $550 buying now than at the ATH of $2850. I don't think we'll drop below $2k (though I may be wrong), so the worst I suspect I'll do is buy at a $300 premium in the short term. 
What I definitely don't want to miss out on is if the price ends back up at $2500 today, I'll be kicking myself for not going with my gut. Picked up 1 more Bitcoin today

By cancelled orders, do you mean direct purchase orders or GDAX limit orders?

Buying the dip takes discipline because it never feels good when prices have been dropping. Our minds naturally create a misleading trajectory thinking that pattern is going to continue indefinitely. This is the inverse of how it's so tempting to buying into an asset that's been soaring in price.
If you've been waiting for the right time to jump into Bitcoin: this is it. We've had a decent correction and has found stable support at &gt;$2200. Memorial Day weekend historically has lead to a small pop which may be enough to push us back to the uptrend.
In either case, if your strategy is hodl, it doesn't matter in the long term if you buy in today or a few days from today. Welcome to the family! ;)

The timeout was increased to 2 weeks in the final adjustment. Any transactions that doesn't get sent through should eventually return by the end of that period
