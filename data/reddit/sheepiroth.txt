You're right, but there still exist many logistical problems:
* Merchants want to cash out into USD seamlessly. I live in NYC and it's probably the best place in the world to buy/sell OTC Bitcoin, but I still use Coinbase because it's a bit less risky and much more convenient.
* Third-party wallet providers will give you an instant USD cashout option.
* There is no good self-hosted shopping cart program/code/plugin to accept Bitcoin as a retailer. So even if you were 100% down with holding Bitcoin and against using a web-wallet provider (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc)... not having an open source (or even closed source!) self-hosted shopping cart is a huge barrier to entry. Somehow after 5 years the Bitcoin community has not considered this a priority.

Good sir, you have some misunderstandings about the way Bitcoin works, which becomes evidently clear to a reader of your point  
Point  is worse yet. The entire point of using a hashing algorithm to secure the network is so that a single user's chances to produce a block scales predictably and linearly with the amount of power they put into the network.

Dogecoin reward halving schedule means that the coin has to double in value every 2 months otherwise the incentive to mine goes away.

@_date: 2015-05-25 16:00:03
you completely missed the point OP
20MB blocks allows an attacker to put 20BM of UTXO spam in each block. let me explain the process:
* an attacker wants to DOS the network via UTXO spam
* they create many transactions with unspent outputs that they will never, ever spend
* they propagate these transactions to the network at a rate of 20MB/10 min
* within 1 week there could be 32 gigabytes of UTXO bloat, preventing any node with less than 32 gigabytes of RAM from initially downloading the block chain
this problem isn't an issue now because of 1MB block sizes and the fee competition that exists because of the 1MB limit.

@_date: 2015-05-26 13:42:43
at the protocol level there isn't really any idea of an address, so the way you wrote your first post is technically wrong, but it doesn't really matter...
this is a real issue because the current state of UTXO in memory is at worst an attack vector and at best a growth limitation factor (excluding regular people from hosting full nodes). changing the the way UTXOs are handled by the system will take dev time and must be tested very very thoroughly 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:47:23
Is it really an edge case if it happens predictably every 10 minutes though?
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:17:54
....you're literally proving my point. Miners leave and the hashrate goes down, thereby making the coin more and more susceptible to a 51% attack. That's a VERY BAD THING. If there's no incentive to mine, there's no security on the network and just about anyone can 51% attack the coin.
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:10:38
Selling a house is a bad example because it necessarily has a long real-time delay in which the fraud would be exposed. It's possible for the color coin to represent some digital item with high value, which at the point of double-spending could be gone before the fraud is discovered. 
Distribution of hashpower is still Bitcoin's most vital security concern.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:15:54
yes and yes, but a solution to the UTXO bloat problem *must* be in place before the block size is increased. it's a pretty important pre-req. it's also a pretty bad trade-off (we're trying to make initial download faster, not slower... it already takes forever).
gavin himself said on IRC that we have to solve the UTXO spam problem before increasing the block size
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:01:57
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:06:18
The block size limit introduces a competition-bottleneck for transactions in such a way that fees must be paid to include them in a block. Separately from the miner's fee there is a "minimum spend" lower-limit for transactions which is around 5400 satoshis. These services must spend/hold at least some satoshi for each OP_RETURN they want mined. That's demand, it might be small, but it's demand.

@_date: 2015-05-25 16:08:32
how is it easier to do it now?
the cost is less with larger blocks because there's less fee competition for space in a block

right now on average blocks are around 600kb, meaning 600kb of transaction data is sent to the network every 10 min
hypothetically: if there were 1.1mb of transaction data propagated to the network every 10 minutes, they wouldn't all fit into a block
miners would include transactions with the highest fees first
if the limit were raised to 20mb while the average transaction volume was still around 1.1mb, that fee competition would disappear
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:36:39
it isn't just miners, but all full nodes who would be effected (people that want to use the Bitcoin-qt wallet, but wouldn't buy a computer with 32gb of RAM just for bitcoin, for example). having full nodes that aren't miners is important for the network. according to Gavin's latest blog post, even if no attack were to happen, UTXO bloat will become a problem for non-industrial full nodes within a short period of time.

this is a huge PR hit to coinbase if true. as a thought experiment, imagine that all information in the world could be instantly broadcast into every mind in the world instantly. there would be no "invisible" users with issues who quietly go through the support process, never going to the community to talk about it. prioritization would be administered on a basis of severity.
in reality, PR is a thing, and threads like these are bad PR. if someone from coinbase doesn't respond it's a multiplier effect. a business has limited resources and PR is always a priority because reputation matters in particular for a business that holds your money.
also, there's a chance that this is FUD or a social engineering/hacking attempt.

i mean how else do you establish a means of trade between valuable goods and services (with intrinsic value) other than creating a unit of exchange between them?
if you solve this problem better than bitcoin you may be the next satoshi!
also, a ponzi scheme necessarily involves paying off new investors with old investors money, while claiming to have full reserves. that isn't the case in a commodity/currency trade scenario - everyone who buys in knows full well the value can drop. a ponzi scheme is akin to a bait-and-switch, you claim to be an "investment fund" or other legitimate entity generating revenue through other means, but really you're just using the money from investors and pretending it's profit from your supposed business

Ok Buzz Killington, if the OP could edit the title and change it to read "Americanized Haiku", would that make you happy?

Why not?

I'm pretty sure Bitcoin was meant to highlight the importance of financial privacy. It's clear that the blockchain needs to be a public ledger, therefore this leaves only two options: Either the transactions are tied to an identity or they are safely anonymous. 
Once Bitcoin gains more mainstream adoption, there will be forces that attempt to mandate that a person's identity must be tied to their Bitcoin address. Those who realize that all money should be equal in the hands of every person should realize also that financial privacy is an important human right.

First of all, I know you're going to downvote this comment, regardless of the fact that I've broken no reddiquite, just because you find it a threat against your original position. That's fine. 
You're making a post which argues that trading in this way is "bullshit", yet it's been going on in the *regulated stock exchange* for years, and some experts actually think it's *helpful* for the economy.

If you are so outraged that people can trade with computers, but can't think of any reason why this is wrong or any possible solution to fixing the problem, what are you complaining about exactly? 
If you're feeling sympathetic for people who trade based on their emotions and panic sell, don't. There exist tools on market sites already that make trading pretty idiot-proof.

I think it is clear that the title is referring to Google's Chinese counterpart, not specifically the company Google.
