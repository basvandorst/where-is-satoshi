If you bothered to read just a bit of the 56-page whitepaper, you'd realize how this completely ties into BitCoin.
The number of full BitCoin nodes are dropping. The net hashrate is on an exponential growth curve, and the difficulty is massively increasing. With the halving coming soon, rewards will be cut in half, cutting mining profitability greatly if the price doesn't double as well. The project intends to add a new layer onto the BitCoin blockchain, which enables a blockchain data market. Businesses would issue data analysis requests as well as a payment, and the nodes would distribute the work to the miners, which would mine for data over the internet. The miners and nodes would in turn get paid based on the work they submit.
And to quote from the introduction: "The new overlay network will be decentralized meaning that anyone can join and anyone running a full Bitcoin node as a service and all of the Bitcoin miners, the two main components of the Bitcoin network, will be paid all of the revenues generated by a new Blockchain Big Data market. "

Where is this? I tried looking for a BitCoin ATM in Fairview Mall (Toronto) earlier today, but then I read that it got moved to a Greyhound station.

Series 4 began once we broke from the double top formed on mid-June and the beginning of November, around yesterday morning. We will probably see a pull-back for a couple of days to the 5100 RMB level to confirm old resistance as new support. Other than that, I can quite optimistically say that we are quite soon on the way to a new ATH.
