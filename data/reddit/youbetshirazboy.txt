Maybe he’ll use some of that for a haircut.

That’s a nice buy, but how funny is it that we’re giving each other high fives over buying a $15,000 bitcoin, considering where it was just a few weeks ago.

OK, then it wasn’t insider trading. It was just a haphazard cluster fuck. Either way I don’t want my money with them. Does that work?

Dammit. Here's your upvote.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:40:05
Ooops. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:52:19
Second.

You can also verify by doing a wire. That’s the route i took. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:22
Nonsense. With something this significant the circle of knowledge needed to be tight, with each member having an executed Non Disclosure Agreements. At best this was a haphazard, reckless event.  At worst it was deliberate fraud.

I love the BCH crowd downvoting this. It’s OK folks, I own some BCH too. No need for a biggest d*ck contest, plenty to go around.
This is not a speculative investment that I’m making just flip it back to Fiat currency, it is an investment that I believe will be the future of currency.

Starting mid 5 figures, low 6 figures after i see how it settles out. I’ve been playing around with smaller amounts and think $6500 is the new floor. I think it’s going to be at $10 (edit: $10K) by the Spring.

And, yes, he has held the whole time. Uses a BTC debit card for incidentals. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:16:01
Ha! Force of habit.

Dammit, here's your upvote.

Yes to this a million times. Mt Gox scared me away, and the lull of 2015 did nothing to excite me. So, I’m late to the game. But I’m in now and THIS  has always been the thing that’s excited me about CC and BTC in particular. To look at it as a speculative investment to change back into fiat is to miss the point entirely. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:30:39
There is zero chance I would’ve done that, but it’s still fun to speculate.

Struck gold selling a tech company. Has millions of $$ in BTC as "extra"
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:17:05
Ha! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:29:53
Oh, you’re absolutely right, but I still like to play those games with myself.

I heard it explained today that small boats get tossed heavily on rough seas but that BTC is a much bigger boat today than it was after Mt Gox. Its still subject to rough seas, but not nearly as much. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:27:14
Thanks. I set myself up with a Bread wallet and transferred some of my BTC over there. I don't see an option to transfer Ethereum. I guess that'll have to stay with Coinbase for now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:03:45
Yeah, I started looking at it, then Mt Gox happened and it scared me off BTC for a while. But....at least I'm here now.

When I heard Andreas A talk about this in a YouTube video that’s when it finally clicked.

If you race into something without knowing what its use case is, its technology, its functionality, its history, or anything else about it and bought it at an all time high then you get what you get.
