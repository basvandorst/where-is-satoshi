Now imagine the older Magneto. "You homo sapiens and your coins!"
Then he finds he can't push down a virtual currency.
"Crypto? They've learned."

Remember Ned's words. Bull run is coming.

Logan: There are no new bull runs, Charles. Hasn't been any bull runs for twenty five months.

ROFL, hey when Bitcoin goes moonmoonmoonmoonmoon... I think that's about as many moons you've experienced + 1, can you like buy a country, build up a hell of a financial defense, and make it a safe haven for Europeans trying to escape the tyranny of the... coastal elite?

It would be cool to have like 1.2 bitcoins, then go moon, then design like a jade skull like the Phantom and part of that skull will be your thingy that holds the bitcoins. Fancy!

It's gonna be really weird to be rich. Maybe I'll buy some land!
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:57:00
Nope. No. You.. wait. Oh yeah. Yeah, I think we're supposed to just buy and hold for a few years. Yeah. Try that. I'm trying that.

I know right? I don't know! I surely do not know. I was drunk when I wrote this. Ah crap, I gotta be at work in an hour. I'm still drunk. Blargh. Also the CEO is... one of them!
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:54:18
I'm very happy for everyone that is dreaming of owning a full bitcoin. Now maybe they will be able to!
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:26:52
That's ok. You can look at mine ^^

Bitcoin is the only friend I know who gets the sudden unstoppable urge to go surfing right after he gets waterboarded.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:09:05
Thanks for doing God's work.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:33:40
Pfft. Good luck getting friendly with anyone that has a lot of Bitcoin. See this is why peasants and nobility are segregated.

With politicians, it depends. If they prioritize money over personal safety and power from the powers that be, they can be bought by another power. If they don't, well, then they'll be in the pocket of... the usual suspects, the every-single-timers, wink wink, nudge nudge.

Bitcoin reminds me of Jaws. Keeps wrecking shit up. Gets killed at the end of the movie. Enter the next Jaws sequel where it wrecks way more shit. Ad infinitum...
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:43:13
Remind me, what's a lambo cost?
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:16:19
Why ban and censor anything? Because the people who have the most power in the world are practically schizophrenic and carry a ton of paranoia. You must not name them, lest yee get banned off of Reddit like I have many times. Twitter. YouTube also. Account after account for naming who they are, what their connection to each other is. Everything you're brought up into behaving and thinking like in a western society is a lie and the exact opposite to objective reality and objective good and healthy living.

That's like saying "DEEEAAAAATH!" at the end of The Return of the King is not a war cry.

I dreamed I had a cat! No name. He could very well have been a lambo. I am very sad now that he is dead. Well he never existed. Sort of a Schrödinger's cat. I could've sworn I had a cat though. He felt like my little snuggly buddy for realsies. He will be sorely missed. Just as normal as it was to me to not have any pets since that's how I live, it's weird to not have my nice white and gray striped cat. A very athletic looking thin and strong cat. Not very big. Very friendly! Apartment cat. He reminds me of my friends cats. They're amazing.
