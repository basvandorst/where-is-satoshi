While technically the same thing, a Bitcoin can be a sentimental thing. Knowing I hold your UTXO vs buying BTC at the same time (which you might not actually do) isn’t always the same IMO.

For the love of god, don't make the same mistake as myself and others in this sub, if you have the means, buy it from her and you won't have regrets later.

Check out [Bitseed]( full nodes that arrive synched to the blockchain up to the date they ship.  Stand alone option, just plug and play.     
EDIT: I have no affiliation to Bitseed. I just own one and have enjoyed my experience thus far.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:57:15
Neat, I dont have an android but I will give this a try.  I run a full node via Bitseed because god damned this this is bulky and slow.  Appreciate the help, will let you know if I run into any more issue and see if I cant ask for more suggestions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:19
Thanks for the post.  Lets make sure the info is up to date and keep on posting!  Appreciate the effort
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:48:59
Its still syncing as I tried deleting the blk.dat files in order to re download the blockchain and give that a try via [this]( resource.  Would I be correct in assuming that it would need to be fully synced prior to seeing receiving addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:17:40
Neat!  I did not know this was an option and will give it a try after work today.  Thank you and will follow up.  I agree with your suggestion for Electrum, but because this was so long ago, he had set up a Bitcoin qt wallet and very few wallets accept wallet.dat files.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:46:37
Just happened friend! Happy 16k
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:14:43
Piggy backing on this comment by supplying one stand alone full core node via [Bitseed](  If you are less tech savy or just want a plug and play node, this is a great resource to help support the network.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:22:23
Correct me if I am wrong, but there doenst seem to be a way to grab the private keys from the wallet.dat file without loading them into a wallet app. Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:44:29
Great post and good idea, I will give it a try.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:50:41
My only issue with this is you would have to do it with Bitcoin Gold, upcoming forks Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Silver, Super Bitcoin and that is just leading into 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:06:53
Electrum cant import .dat files if I am not mistaken, and to import I would need private keys which I would need to dump, and it is my understanding that Bitcoin QT is the only wallet that uses .dat files.  I also had it synched and am currently trying a second time.  Currently up to 2017 but no coins have shown up yet....
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:57:41
Great job guys!  Way to work together in a decentralized way and demand accountability.  Keep it up.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:19:44
Does the .dat file need to be called wallet.dat and replace the original wallet file?
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:57:46
You can still trade shares on Havelock.  I just sold the remaining shares I had in my account.  Better than nothing I suppose.

Just in case you decide you would like to buy a full node instead of make you own, I find few people know about this company and their products.  Super easy to install and set up.  
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:25:39
I hear this a lot, regardless of your opinion on the topic, a solution would be a wallet application that allows an auto replenish feature that connects to a bank account or credit card to automatically re buy to a specified dollar or BTC amount. I'm excited for the future. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 00:29:25
Cool idea!

Any idea when trading other crypto currencies could be expected on MtGox?  After recent events I think its best to focus on Bitcoin, but after the market has given time to cool down?  If so, whats the process you guys go through when determining which currencies are to be traded on MtGox.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:41:23
Watching this now.  Im curious why you focused on illicit acts and dismissing it so quickly, instead of focusing on the true value and purpose of bitcoin.  
Awesome BOA advertisement after your segment as well.  Had a good laugh.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:28:28
Its only been 1 day since all this happened.  I would tell ANYONE thinking of suicide after the market dips 60% is to CHILL OUT! I don't know what will happen in the next week, the next month or the next year, but I can say this, "you don't lose on an investment until you cash out"  Relax and take a breath.

Can I ask a little about your S.Dice stock?  
Im interested in investing in a bitcoin gambling site but am curious about all the info required to make an educated decision.  What aspects made you invest and what have been your returns thus far?
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:39:34
Was not aware of that.  Touche
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:10:12
I know their consumer servies reps are being bombarded so I thought I might try and get an answer out of someone who made a BitInstant deposit today.  My question still stands.  If you do not have any info its ok.  I will survive.
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:22:27
Why do the reporters all have to talk over each other?  And this is Bloomberg?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:36:21
Use sites like:   or countless other BTC exchanges instead of relying solely on Mtgox.  If we get to 100+ exchanges, if one is hit by a DDOS you can just choose to use another trading platform.

What about Bitfloors easy of use with cash deposits?  Campbx is another.

I have made transitions to my wallet from Mt Gox and it has taken days to synchronize with the network if you have not done so in a while.  If your wallet is 100% synchronized then I would contact customer support.  If it is still loading, wait it out, might take a while but you should see your transaction show up shortly.

dump them.  So many better exchanges.  Using Bitfloor and the easy of use and cash deposits are awesome.

Nice analogy 
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:04:18
Sad to hear someone with your position and dedication to topics of currency dismiss it with such a response. 
Making early adopters rich seems like a cop out in your issues with Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:13:58
I just purchased on Bitfloor at $60!  First time I have ever used their service and I am impressed!  Did a cash deposit at a Bank of America and cleared by the time I got home (less than a block away!)  I will be using them from now on.  I suggest others to check it out as well!

I am looking to withdrawal USD
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:35:26
May I ask you how plan on cashing out?  I have wondered about the withdrawal process for large sums of currency.  
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:31:08
you are hard to please. 
You could aslo add USD into your account, and then just chose to wait and watch the market before putting all your funds in.  At least then they are available when you want them without having to deal with Mtgox and other BS.
@_date: 2013-03-02 17:11:47
Anyone want to go into a bit of detail on what a faucet site actually is?  I know the gist, but would like to know more.

I didn't see any option for vouchers, however I was not looking.  They deposit USD into your account and then you can choose which price to buy BTC at, or transfer USD to another exchange I believe.

How are the dividend calculated? Cheaper to go through btct.co instead of Halverstrom (spelling that right) or other competitors?

Correct. If it is not mentioned in the tags, summary or title it will not show up.

Came here to say exactly this.  Its nice seeing someone speak so calmly and in an educated manor to give everyone the idea most of us would agree with.  I am going to look for more videos from him.

How does one that purchases a Pass-through share ensure that the original owner will transfer dividends?
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:59:40
You are still not convincing me that making money, for realizing value in a system never used before, is a bad thing. When the dot com rush was happening did you call out early investors for "hoarding"?
 The only difference is we are talking about a currency in of itself, which also can be used as a form to diversify savings. Cyprus and now Argentina are looking for was to avoid government intervention on what to do with their money. They have every right to do so.
i would hate to see someone like yourself on the wrong side of history, when such huge and fundamental changes are occurring. 
I just ask you do a little digging and try to look at the concept of Bitcoins (not just bitcoin, but other crypto currencies as well) to better understand some possible beneficial impacts such systems have on today.
