it perhaps can be restored
Don't do anything with the flash drive.

that's the point, to stop the attack on the network, by users who try to corrupt the Satoshi Nakamoto rules.

no. blockchain technology is a buzzword.

more arguments
Classic vaporware - there is no qualified Classic team
Hardfork to crash economy - hardfork can crash the Bitcoin system
Hardfork freeze coins - no matter what side wins the weak chain will be destroyed and all weak chain coins frozen forever
Hardfork cause loss of funds - payments made during the fork can be reorganized and cancelled
Classic cannot VISA Scale - Visa offers 1000 payments per second. Bitcoin offers 4 per second, Classic offers 8 per second
Spam and 1MB cap is temporary - We all know that the spam never ended and big blocks will be full from the start, clogging the network
0-confirmations are unsafe - Even 1 confirmed transaction can become lost if the block is orphaned
All miners mine 1MB now - This is the truth and all miners currently respect Satoshi Nakamoto's 1MB cap
1MB causes delayed confirmations - With proper fees, payments go trough without a delay

SHA-256 isn't safe? bullshit. Source?
also Bitcoin use ECDSA but on koblitz curve. so why shoud there be a problem?

every bump raises the fee
infinite bumps, infinite fees no problem

r1 with nsa made  random number generator :) anyway satoshi dodged that bullet using koblitz :)

this is difficult to know. Only certain governments or companies like Facebook, Google who know information about many people can answer this.
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:32:16
affected by what? anyway good luck stealing funds using ecdsa vulnerability when all funds are secured by pay to pubkey _HASH_
good luck colliding ripemd160

I must be dreaming. Is bitcoin a real thing in Russia.
What a long way we went since 2008

your balance will show up when core synchronizes.
core doesn't show balance until it's 100% sure you have the funds. so if u got the funds recently, core need to catch up to the moment when you recieved the funds. hope you understand

@_date: 2016-02-02 19:32:33
lol DASH?
@_date: 2016-02-02 21:31:37
the many outputs are the multiple destination addresses
it's where various parts of the 2 bitcoins from inputs go
some of the output could be change
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:25:44
Hopefully altcoins aren't affected
