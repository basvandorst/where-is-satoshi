Yes and no. It’s coinbase wallet but there’s no money in it cuz I’m broke ��
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:40:43
It’s the randomness that’s cool
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:38:37
Haha no I’m just curious to see whether this weird idea works

Have you heard of Stratis Breeze Wallet? I’ve read that it is powered by Tumblebit. So tumblebit can be implemented on multiple blockchains simultaneously?

I see. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:33:54
What does that mean?

Apple and Amazon will accept btc as payment?

Apple market cap = ~720 billion.
Btc market cap = ~90 billion (8 times smaller than Apple).
To be as big as Apple, current price 5000 x 8 = 40000 USD.
And I think bitcoin is just as popular as iPhone nowadays.

Ah.. very enlightening. Thank you!

These people who keep saying bitcoin can be used like cash should go buy a car using bitcoin then regret it later.
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:30:32
Please tell me the difference.

No way. The volatility in 2015 was much lower than in 2017. Look at the graphs man.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:29
Volatility is dropping all the time??? Lol you’re funny my friend.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:23:29
What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:24:25
So when will bitcoin become popular like iPhone?

Hi, I’m a rapper, Uber driver, and used to be a Bitcoin investor. In the video I talk a little bit about why I think it’s hard for Bitcoin to succeed, and I’m open to criticism. Let me know what you think.
