No. I said the "whole point" of decentralization is to NOT have a governing body that you can "turn to for help" and wait for them to bail you out when you are careless. Without decentralization, crypto is nothing more than a glorified swift payment system. Meaning, it has very little reason to exist without its core "concept" (not simply a feature) of being decentralized and trustless.
You can say that 95% don't care about decentralization, but I scoff at legitimacy of that arbitrary number.

You are comparing this year to one of the greatest bull runs in crypto history, that's why. You are very short sighted, imo, and that alone puts you at a disadvantage for understanding why. Please understand that BTC went 20x last year. My argument isn't that BTC will simply 20x once again and hit $200k by the end of this year. 


Most people understood that the ATH of $20k in that short amount of time was not a "healthy rise" for any market and that there would likely be a serious correction afterwards. Then, of course, we saw a serious alt-coin explosion in the following month. Expecting that entire process to repeat itself 3 months later is ignorant at best, and once again shows a lack of understanding of how this market works. Maybe you should stick to more traditional markets where extreme volatility is less of a factor?
Nonetheless, what we see today is a more sensible rise and correction, along with a fare amount of accumulation periods. This is exactly what I believe will be necessary to start the next bull cycle, but we also need a catalyst, which I believe may come in the form of a Bitcoin ETF, along with more mainstream companies (such as Telegram, Google, etc) getting involved in the near future. Once again, if you paid more attention to institutional investing and OTC markets, you would see a different story than the "doom and gloom" scenario that you continuously pontificate.


When you have the greatest bull run in crypto history, guess what? That also means you'll see the greatest correction in crypto history. Basic crypto investing 101. There is no way that Bitcoin could sustain such price movement; so yes, falling below any x-day moving average is not too baffling at all.


This is just arrogance at its peak now.
I do follow some T.A. and respect a lot of people in that field, but neither they, nor myself, claim to know what Bitcoin's price will be tomorrow, let alone 6 months from now. This market is exceedingly speculative and driven by unusual circumstances. Not very many T.A. guys looked at their charts in April 2017 and said BTC would be $20k in December. lol Telling us it will go to $6500, before it goes to $9500 requires little expertise in the field. Many say it will go to $5k. Great. My concern is "Will the value of BTC be much higher by the end of 2018 than it is today?" I say, the probability of that is extremely high, based on what I'm hearing and seeing in the background.
You can continue to argue $6500 vs $9500 next month if you like.

I don't like this blatant stereotyping of ETF supporters, for one. Do ETF supporters want more liquidity in the market and exposure to mainstream investors in order to increase Bitcoin's monetary value? Of course, but it is not as simple as saying, "we want it even if it means bringing problems to Bitcoin." For the most part, early adopters of Bitcoin recognize that institutional investors will eventually get involved, *heavily*, whether we like it or not. We are embracing change that is *inevitable*, and if Bitcoin is as resilient as many of us believe it is, then it should be able to handle the test of an ETF without catastrophic consequences. What is to stop any other country in the world from essentially doing exactly what the SEC is considering, next month or sooner? Nothing, really... except the will to do so. The U.S. wants to be one of the first to trade BTC publicly through an ETF, and I do support it, knowing full well that these institutions are not exactly our friends at the end of the day... and tbh, might even be our enemies at this point.
We can't stop our enemies from joining in... but at least this is an enemy that most of us in here are familiar with.

lol Ridiculous.
You are simply wrong, and your "cash example" further proves that you have no idea of how decentralized currency transfers work. How the hell can cash be used to send your funds around the world in 10 minutes, let alone without a governing body being in complete control of its fate? Futhermore, how do you protect such cash from confiscation or devaluation by a governing body that becomes hostile towards you? It is impossible.
If you think decentralization is just a "feature," then you have no understanding of   why Bitcoin is inherently resistant to centralization. Considering all of this, your request to have some kind of "governing body" take control of *our* funds because *you* can't be trusted to protect your own keys , should be shunned entirely.
Chase Bank is still right around the corner if you need it though.

That makes no sense. You can't just "peg the price" of something to an asset without backing it with that same asset... otherwise, it is just pegged to hot air and nobody could justify the correlated spot price. It would collapse the second any holders with common sense realized this.
Even Tether is "backed" (in theory) by USD and USD valued assets. However, the controversy surrounding them was based on whether they were "fully" backed as they initially claimed to stakeholders... hence the fears of a potential collapse.

Without going too deep into the TA of Bitcoin, I look for more than just the simple idea of: "it went up in the past." 
I look at Bitcoin in terms of probability, usability, and risk. Based on historical value, asset appreciation, consumer / business interest, technical advancements, future use-cases, improved user experience etc... I can say that the chances of Bitcoin being worth more in 2 years is MUCH higher than it being worth $100, like some people are predicting. Such doubters exist in *every* market, so I am not swayed by them.
Yes, I obviously enjoy being here because of the profitability in trading... but I also believe in the recent technology that crypto-currencies are introducing to the mainstream world, and I firmly believe that blockchain technology is not likely to go away any time soon... just like I didn't believe that video game technology / industry would simply go away after the gaming recession from 1983-1984... Otherwise, why would I still be here???

Good response and interesting stuff.
I definitely agree that Satoshi walking away (or getting kidnapped... or dying... or well, who knows what really happened there) is a very unique part of Bitcoin's history. 
It's a mystery that may indeed go unsolved for the rest of our lives...
But... for argument's sake, what if Satoshi returned? I imagine he owns a lion's share of BTC and would have quite a bit of influence over Bitcoin's future, being its creator and knowing it inside out. If he could prove his legitimacy, would he then become the clear leader, and would that remove a lot of that uniqueness of BTC?. 
Could Satoshi's well-publicized return thrust him into the spotlight and make him become what Vitalik is to Ethereum... or would the community simply reject such an idea?
I do wonder what would happen in that scenario.

To be fair, these are usually some of the easiest people to scam... because of their *overconfidence* in the game. These people simply believe that unlike the rest of suckers, *they* are too good to become victims. This way of thinking, for many people, often encourages them to let their guard down, and they fail to do the necessary due diligence / research in order to avoid even the most obvious con games like this one. One quick search in Google would have revealed plenty of warnings about the potential theft that you walked into.
I can't even begin to count how many "*I got scammed!*" threads I've read where the scammed person said the exact same thing: "*I usually consider myself to be a tough target because I'm pretty savvy when it comes to...*"

Its open-source nature and ability to upgrade over time is what makes Bitcoin truly genius...

There was a time when 1 Bitcoin = 1 cent.
What long term holders have learned since then is that tipping 1 cent worth of BTC is not the same as tipping 1 cent in USD.
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:46:55


Just a few months later? lol It was almost a year later... Seriously, it took 10+ months to reach $1000+ usd mark from the 10-$15 range. If you really wanted to buy, you would have had plenty of time. It didn't exactly sneak up on you in the blink of an eye... You missed out, but that was a calculated choice.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:41:31
It's somewhere between a "centralized" and "decentralized" exchange. It doesn't hold users' funds (one of the biggest criticisms of centralized exchages), but it does facilitate trades using a centralized solution. Fees still go to Binance and the trading rules are set / controlled by their company, obviously.
However, it removes a lot of risks associated with sending funds into a centralized exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:34:38
USD value still tells a significant story for alts... but Binance Coin (for example) was able to outpace BTC over the last year under-the-radar because many people's eyes were overly focused on USD value, instead of watching it's BTC comparison outperform &amp; eventually skyrocket past BTC.
Granted, such performance is atypical for most alts in a bear market.

For people who listened to mouthpieces (Dimon), it cost them an opportunity.
There is always a cost.

Most of the peopoe who held Bitcoin from $100 all the way to $10,000 were the people who simply forgot that they were even holding Bitcoin to begin with. Some remembered many years later... but many also lost their keys in the process. Anyone who was actually paying attention to Bitcoin likely sold it looooong before the current prices. 
You may have missed out on a few thousand dollars, but millions is laughable, considering how risky the investment seemed at the time and how Impulsive humans tend to be. That's why I laugh at all these people who think they would still be holding 100 Million worth of BTC today if they hadn't spent it on "such and such" in 2013. Please... lol

To be honest, I'm not sure you understand the technological advancements involved in creating a decentralized, immutable, and censorship-resistant currency... or at least, not enough to argue its importance in the present or future, let alone determine its short term success (less than a decade of open-source development). In fact, your interpretation of it just being an "alternative currency" tells me enough... 
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:38:01


Nearly there is relative.... From &lt; 1cent to over $1k usd in less than a decade is quite a feat for a newly created currency.

True, but he already owns Bitcoin... unless you are offering him a free alternative.

Not buying early and holding is what cost people fortunes, historically in investing.
@_date: 2019-01-23 06:07:57
Ah man, that gave me a good laugh.
I think he meant don't tell anyone exactly how much you own, but it's perfectly fine to admit to holding / owning BTC in my opinion.

I disagree, wholeheartedly.
An ETF further legitimizes a newly-established market involving technology that many people see as a "fad," or worse, "play money." Government acknowledgement goes a long way in providing peace of mind to those in the general public, who may still be on the fence today.
Bitcoin has gone through many different phases, in terms of public opinion. Initially, it was seen as a virtual money used for underground ("dark web") services. Then it became unfairly associated with real world vices, like drug dealers, pimps, and of course, prostitution. Soon after, it became associated with money laundering and the funding of terrorism... This was not a healthy trend for Bitcoin. The obstacles for adoption were becoming bigger and darker.
I think we've gotten away from quite a bit of that "sketchy" reputation, due to increased demand, as well as government support, like we are seeing today with the ETF debates. The fact that a Bitcoin ETF is actually being defended by a standing official in the SEC shows us how far crypto has come since Satoshi's "original vision".
Unfortunately, times change rapidly, and Satoshi's "original vision" was only meant to take Bitcoin so far imo... because not even the great creator could have predicted the political and international impact that his currency would have on the world by the year 2020, way back in 2008... and he's not around to claim otherwise.

I'm not sure about the term "economic inflation," unless you are referring to price inflation.
We can more accurately compare BTC to USA's monetary inflation this year however, by looking at their money printing efforts such as Quantitative Easing. Price inflation is closely tied to monetary inflation, so I wouldn't be surprised to see similar numbers. Feel free to share the data, if you can prove otherwise of course.

Effected ~ cause (something) to happen; bring about.
Affected ~ influenced or touched by an external factor.
Both are similar to a degree, and usually require a good understanding of English to distinguish the difference &amp; use properly. One is usually a verb, while the other is usually a noun, but that doesn't always hold true in every case.

Interesting read. 
I know I'll be holding BTC for the long term (not concerned about quantum computing in the forseeable future) and I've become somewhat numb to the USD price fluctuations, as I do believe it is sound money when compared to the dollar and other fiat currencies. Some will argue it's too slow or difficult to use, but I have yet to find a better solution for loss of value due to inflation and hyper-inflation.
Thanks for sharing.

Please, spare us the sermon... Welcome to LIFE, buddy.
You think Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and  Elon Musk were all just in it for the tech? No, but they didn't let that inhibit them from seeking progress and expanding the adoption of the tech. Times change, and Bitcoin, like most technologies, must either adapt to the changing environment or die.

I bet Santa's largest shitcoin holding is aElf...
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:03:09


Does that mean you don't want this wager?
And yes, in terms of probability, of course BTC will likely be worth more in the future. Nobody can predict the exact price, but the odds of it being higher are heavily in the favor of current BTC holders. Not slightly... but *heavily*. 
So I'm saying with great confidence that today is still "down," long term.

It's difficult to compare Bitcoin to any fiat currency due to various economic factors, as there is no Bank of Satoshi or Central Authority to account for.. We know that the U.S inflation rate touted the most is a calculated price inflation based on a basket of goods, but where are you getting your U.S monetary inflation numbers from?

Uhh... no.
The push for an  ETF isn't going away anytime soon, so you better get used to it. For better or for worse, the idea is here to stay, and it will eventually happen.

Lol There is definitely a bit of exaggeration going on to prove the point, but interesting meme none the less.

Last time I checked, BTC was still up today from $800 at the beginning of last year. Try zooming out, idiot.
Yes, tried and failed to push it below the lowest trend line several times in the past, not even counting the current status which is simply holding. Nobody said we are "out of the woods," btw, that's not what this conversation is about.
You can keep waiting for 4k, you silly cuck, but it isn't happening.

All of the details have not been released yet, but there is speculation that it will be a cryptographically secure network that is completely centralized.

This is still "down," if you are thinking long term.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:16:42


LOL @ Experts.
And I'd call anybody who calls themself an "expert" in crypto an idiot, just for calling themselves that. You mean the same experts who predicted Bitcoin was dead in 2014? Who gives a fuck what they think.
The fact that you think they are relevant says enough.

You are not going to shill me on BNB... because, first I don't believe it is even close to being one of "the best" alt coin you can hold, let alone the absolute best, and second, I see too many limitations of it. Your statements are almost insulting.
Also "Skyrocket" is relative. What qualifies as skyrocketing for you is likely not even close to the potential for other alts in the future to me.

lol You guys are getting trolled...
OP is not looking for a legitimate discussion regarding the positive effects that a Bitcoin ETF would have on the crypto market... He's simply arguing the obvious -- that custody services, exchanges, etc. can all be hacked &amp; seized, while middlemen collect fees. 
No shit, Sherlock. You're preaching to the fuckin' choir: Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-14 03:30:35


More stable? Bitcoin is like 3 months from its all time high and just experienced a 70% correction (crash). If that's stability, then I wonder what you would consider unstable.

People forget that before the run up to $20k, there was a huge sell off that previous holders had to endure. Everybody says they "wish" they had bought in after the price has already sky-rocketted... but they never think about what holders must have gone through in order to accumulate those positions at the "newest lows" and survive the harsh volatility in between.
The "foreseeable future" is not always foreseeable.

Sorry, but that's not an original argument. Going from 1k to 20k did not make most people instant millionaires either, btw. If you are arguing that BTC is at the peak at current levels, I think that is very unlikely.
I think you are very mistaken in thinking there is no more room to run.

Your first plan should be to get out of debt... Whether crypto can one day help you out or not should have no bearing on how you handle debt today, because it may never come. If you are wanting crypto to be your savior, you will likely sell before the point where you'll ever attain anything life changing... because you are in a pressure cooker, waiting for any type of movement.
As far as relationships go, money will never help that... it will only magnify whatever issues were previously present. Trust me on that.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:38:59
Definitely a lot more room to grow!
I've watched BTC user confidence dwindle quite a bit during this bear market... and other than a couple recent grey hairs on my head (lol), I'm still here learning for the long run. I'm glad to be a part of this community for many years to come... even if I feel like the price doesn't (and may never) reflect how much BTC has advanced in my eyes.

@_date: 2018-12-28 20:59:43


Fair question.
For me, decentralization has opened my eyes to how much control a government entity holds over our purchasing power, and the potential catastrophic consequences that come along with that. A good example would be situations like in Venezuela, where the controlling government has inflated the local currency so much to the point where it is worth less than dirt. There is now an alternative option for storing value over time, that is resistant to such attacks... and if you tune out most of the online noise screaming about short term price action, I think you'll certainly see the bigger picture here.
