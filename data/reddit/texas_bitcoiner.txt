But how would they sell the coins when the transactions never show up at the buyer's full node? I certainly would not pay for coins that can't be sent to my own wallet.

There is no single address with a million BTC. These early coins are all sitting untouched in batches of 50 which was the block reward at the time they were mined.

As others have said, with CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY you would have to fund the address and have no way to spend the funding output. What you want to use is pre-signed transactions with  a locktime. You can do it with [coinb.in]( in the "New Transaction"&gt; "Advanced Options" section or use Trezor: [

What are the privacy implications of rotating a key? Won't this either link all UTXOs in the wallet or cost a lot of fees when sending one transaction per UTXO? 
If the key rotation process is automated, how can the user confirm that the new destination address(es) are actually in his control?

Nice that you can select the UTXOs! Will they all be broadcasted at the same time with the same fee or can you delay the process? I am asking because without a delay they would all end up in the same block and thus make it quite visible that the keys were rotated.

Just send smaller amounts back and forth until you feel more comfortable.

Electrum has testnet support. Just start the client from the terminal with the --testnet flag.

How does it look up transactions? Does it support segwit?

You can create the transaction with a watch-only wallet on your online computer and then export it to sign it on the offline computer.
To set up the watch-only wallet on the online computer, first restore the seed on the offline computer and copy the extended public key from the 'Wallet Information' menu in Electrum.
Then use the extended public key to restore a Electrum watch-only wallet on your online PC where you can prepare the transaction.
