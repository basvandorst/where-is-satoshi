If you read about it they’re one of the only coins that are targeting the banks where coins like bitcoin is targeting individuals and peer to peer transactions. If it’s one thing we know, it’s that banks have a lot of money to blow and having that hedge is what I think ripple is taking advantage of.

That’s under the assumption that all currencies will be on bitcoins blockchain technology. For example litecoin uses bitcoins blockchain technology but a string of other coins use the ethereum blockchain which is a competitor to bitcoin. In my opinion competition is good because coins, companies and communities must work hard every day in order not to be left behind and this will create value, awareness and ultimately mass adoption.

Interesting read. Really puts into perspective what we hedge bitcoins value on.

Same. But this is actually fucked for real if they do mass closures. Since when do banks tell us where to spend our hard earned money as well. Bunch of crooks!

If there was 1 BTC in circulation and you and I bought and sold that BTC 8 times today, it would mean the trading volume for today was 8 BTC. It doesn't mean 8 BTC exist, all it means is that 8 BTC worth of trading occurred today.
