the only pools showing a smaller percentage of total hash rate are Bitmain controlled while a pool labeled as "other" keeps growing. Jihan playing games as usual

"Tales from the crypt" is probably the best bitcoin podcast right now
"The Crypto Miner Podcast" for anybody into mining.
Best old Podcast is hands down "Bitcoin Uncensored"
Junseths World, Noded, and The Bitcoin Game are also worth listening to.

Might be worth waiting for next generation miners coming this fall/winter (Avalon, Whatsminer, etc)

I was disappointed when these guys stopped doing shows on LTB. Then a few weeks ago Tone Vayes mentioned the best bitcoin podcast being Bitcoin Uncensored with JunSeth &amp; Chris DeRose....I have to agree.  Adam....you dropped the ball!!

How will a block increase solve this issue when the Chinese pools keep mining empty blocks??? 
@_date: 2016-01-12 10:42:48
Yes bitcoin is capitalist hence the reason it is mentioned. It is certainly not a bad thing, but having pride over humility is of course a sin.

Exactly why I stopped mining on Antpool and EVERYONE else should move their miners to a smaller, more responsible pool such as Kano
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:15:01
BTC.com is Antpool
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:59:01
Maybe Antpool should start mining blocks with transactions included in them...
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:25:25
If Antpool would stopped mining empty blocks this might not be as much of a problem

If he is concerned about full blocks, maybe he should make an issue of the empty blocks being mined some of the chinese mining pools. All talk and no substance

TREZOR hands down 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:44:33
Will compare original Trezor vs original Ledger Nano
Reason being: I purchased both Ledger Blue and Nano S. ETH wallet on Ledger Blue did not work for me so I sold it. I found the url used to access Trezor wallet easier than the Chrome extensions with Ledger so I sold the Nano S as well. Appears the original Nano has been left in the dust as the newer HD wallets from Ledger are the main focus. I only use Trezor at this point and have not used ledger in awhile so I may be wrong. Yes the Nano S has more features than the original but Trezor 2 is releasing soon which I believe will still be a better option than Ledgers products.
1. Slush &amp; Stick = BTC OG's
2. Trezor is open source, Ledger is not
3. Access to major btc forks was prompt on Trezor (My original Ledger nano did not allow me to access BTG, maybe that has changed since then?)
4. Ledger has an active known exploit plus they plan to use Intel chips on future projects
5. Trezor comes in more colors ��
6. Ledger Nano uses a separate security card as a secondary layer of security but this could get misplaced. If you have multiple Nanos then security cards could get mixed up if you are unorganized.
7. Ledger Nano only supports BTC and BCH as far as I am aware. Trezor supports BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, and possibly a few others.

R4's are definitely the way to go for winter heat. Only place you will find them are Amazon and Ebay. Bitmain stopped selling them last winter

Mining on a large pool is NOT more profitable than mining a small pool. In fact, mining on a pool that shares TX fees with its users (Kano, Slush, etc) will be more profitable than a pool that does not (Antpool).Bitmain is the largest asic manufacture and self mining so of course their pools will have a significant amount of hash.

Yeah i only wanted to send .004, my trezor never fully loads on my computer for some odd reason so I was unable to see other addresses on it

Yes these are configured at Antpool but cron jobs are available online to customize pool settings. You can also buys these from other online sellers that already have customized firmware on there to change settings

These devices are not about making money but more of a toy for hobbyist and actually pretty fun to tinker with. A bunch of guys on Bitcointalk.org have hacked these to change pool settings, over clock, etc. Check out Antrun.de and you can see some of the amazing shares some guys are getting out of these things.

Probably not much of a market for people wanting to use bitcoin to pay rent which was partially the purpose of this post, to hear what others had to say on the subject.
On the other hand I would argue that there are people that have figured out how to mine bitcoin in a profitable manner. Those proceeds could be used to offset their normal monthly expenditures instead of converting into dollars if there was an incentive to do so. 
I think bitcoin will continue to grow as a result of innovative ideas that bring businesses and consumers together because of an economical incentive. I will suggest purse.io is one of these ideas put into action. Paying rent in bitcoin could be viable if a mutual incentive was factored in.
