Where are you located? In the US in most states a 16 year old can open a bank account (simple checking account) with, and often *without* parental permission. With parental permission you can have one at a much younger age depending how it's set up (beneficiary, etc). Just google your state to find out the laws, and you can also call a few different banks to find out their policy.
If you're outside the US I can't help much, but as others have said you can use straight cash to buy BTC using localbitcoins. Some are done face to face, others are done with a cash deposit to a bank account (you don't need *usually* need an ID for this) at a particular bank. I've never personally used it, but plenty of people swear by buying their coins this way.

It sounds like the truly bad exchange out there right now is Poloniex. I was going to create an account recently because they are one of the few exchanges with cannabis-related currencies. (I'm in the industry and merely curious, doubtful that any of them will take off in any big way.) But after reading a bunch of horror stories about locked accounts, insufficient staff, etc, I am staying as far away from them as possible. 
I've done some regular business with Coinbase after Circle stopped exchanging BTC and haven't had any problems myself, but if I were dealing with large amounts of money I would absolutely be skeptical of any but the most professional exchanges and as others have said; ***never keep your coins in a public wallet!***
