this all too much for me. i dont understand half of it and maybe when i get to step 43 im gonna find that this isnt supported in my country. im sorry if this sounds arrogant but my focus is moving money from my customers to me to my table. i simply want an option that accepts btc  and when i need the cash, take your cut, and send the funds to my normal bank account, regardless of currency. i understand the focus around here is to promote bitcoin and what it brings to us and our children but for now this is where i am.
ps. thanks for your answer

im not familiar with all the options. i understand Luno and is great. i can accept bitcoin but getting the money off is a problem. i was hoping for a solution that would simply pay me in dollars from a customers' bitcoins. 
another answer explained it quite well. the way to go is simply getting suppliers to accept rather than running around trying to converty everything

thank you
i think the only real solution is finding suppliers that accept btc. what you say makes sense. and honestly sucks to read. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:39:26
none of that here
@_date: 2019-04-07 17:08:30
sure but the cook doesnt accept bitcoins so i need fiat
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:32:17
thank you!
definitely agree. im trying to keep some btc but havent been able to as I can take the risk in keeping it somewhere like you mentioned. appreciate your response

thank you. 
is this a device or app? its lists countries proudly that im not in unfortunately. 
they also have cards it seems. is this universal and borderless?
edit: they seem to have it all. thanks for the info

doesnt really solve it then

theres always a new company with a fancy website promoting some xthis and ythat but its always a hassle to actually use it. going through registration and device requirements and kyc and delivery options. it would be great if they just simply explained "hey heres this thing, this is where it can be used, this is how its used (with pictures) and heres how we can get it applied for you"
edit: spoonfeed isnt always bad and is really required when these new things come out and promise the world
