Thanks for explaining. New here and trying to learn :)
What is a "CSV soft-fork" and why does it matter if it's activated? Thanks

Is breadwallet truly secure (assuming you secure the paper seed)?
Would it survive the app's creator going bust? what do you do if the app is no longer available?

Yes I am asking, though I do hold enough bitcoin, for now. Did you put 100% of your savings and income into Bitcoin? If not, why not?
Most experienced investors do a phased in (long) and out (short). This way you take extra profits along the way.
The opposite opinion would be to buy (at any price) and hold for a longer time period, but that seems less refined.

One interesting view: 
"Some argue that the Bitcoin community has been fully aware of the halving of miners’ reward for a long time and that the actual decline in the supply of bitcoins will not surprise most Bitcoin enthusiasts and traders in the community.
Historically, halving of miner’s reward has had no substantial effect on the price of Bitcoin. On November 28, 2012, the first time the miners’ reward was halved, there was no visible impact on the value of Bitcoin, which was worth around USD $13.40 per bitcoin."
"The reward halving will change the inflation rate in Bitcoin. How that affects the overall economy depends on the conditions of all the other parameters in the economy: price, adoption, transaction volume, hashrate, difficulty, investments, other currencies, world market conditions, etc"

Interesting, thanks. What factors do you think are making the "bubble bigger and bigger"?
What would be the devil's advocate arguments that speak against an ever rising price?
Thanks :)
