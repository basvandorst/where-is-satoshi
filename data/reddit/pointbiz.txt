Hardware fails and you need the mnemonic seed backed up on paper regardless. So it's a very similar security scenario. Paper wallets are great for deep cold long-term storage but caution must be taken when spending. Hardware wallets are user friendly for new people and minimizes several relevant risk factors (spending securely, not storing on a hot device). 
Bitaddress.org still has it's niche and it provides accessibility by being free.

Here are the issues listed on github:
The only one I know of where someone lost money:
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:03:49
Regarding this:
That article has no issue with JavaScript and cryptography. It takes issue with dynamic content. My site provides instructions on how to verify the package the JavaScript is delivered in. Always in an all-in-one HTML file that has a well known and signed hash. As well as a detached signature from my PGP key that is NOT sitting on the web server. The article suggests someone find a better way and I did. 
It's well known bitaddress.org is about offline cold paper wallets.
Thinking philosophically... using a verified open source JavaScript file is much safer than trusting a person who issued a binary. Especially, if the binary is auto-updating (browser extensions... that's why I don't issue one. I don't want to ask people for that level of trust). If you don't like offline Javascript then I suggest offline Python. The key similarity here being open source code run via an interpreter or jit-compiler where you don't have to trust the binary build process (deterministic binary build processes being the exception. Bitcoin Core does a great job of this).
A person should be able to authenticate code then do a cursory review to ensure it's not malicious (Ctrl+F XMLHttpRequest). In-depth reviews are done on the same authenticated code on Github.
If you still don't feel comfortable then steer clear. I just didn't want to leave the biased opinion unanswered.

You add "this" to someone else's comment not your own. I actually thought you were a sock puppet now I genuinely see you are a noob. 
Commenting gives post more weight because there is discussion around what the person said. That's the value of "this" plus it's a great show of emotion.

I welcome your review, on github as well. Thank you for your feedback in this thread.
If a better JS crypto stack with more thorough testing is made open source by someone else I will happily adopt it. My project is based on the libraries picked by the BitcoinJS guys at the time. I'm open to switching out some libraries.
The ideal deployment model is on an offline machine (bootable usb type thing). I'm not a fan of brain wallets... cat's out of the bag. Some people use it as a tool to plug in secure entropy from another source (like OS randomness).
I don't want to rely just on "getRandomValues" (Android had an issue with the OS RNG; we could find out there is one in Windows/Linux one-day) that's why I still use the RC4 PRNG and XOR with getRandomValues. There is an issue thread about entropy on github. There has been some review as seen on the bitcointalk.org thread and github and there's been bugs. It's hard to say how "heavy" the review has been and it sure would add value to have a "heavy-hitter" like yourself lend some advice, review, point in the right direction.
I'm my opinion, people want a tool like this.
@_date: 2016-08-15 02:24:13
OK you're fine. You downloaded the zip from github and their certificate didn't have issues. Either way this problem on the site wasn't malicious there wasn't any tampered file that could have redirected you elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:57:25
I don't see how bitaddress.org encourages address reuse; you can print as many addresses as you need. The single wallet tab has text that encourages you to sweep the key when you go to spend.
BIP32 is great and time permitting I will add it to bitaddress.org as an additional way to generate keys. However, it's advisable not to put a master seed on a "hot" machine. Redeeming one key at a time is safer (assuming you divided value over many keys). So you might want more than just your master seed on paper. Another solution is using an offline machine to get the individual private keys from the master seed using some tool.

@_date: 2016-04-03 03:51:31
So the incentived behavior change for wallets is to add an extra txin from a loose change UTXO in the wallet?
Meaning if today the transaction has 1 input and 2 outputs then under this new incentive the wallet could (optionally) make it 2 input and 2 output in such a way as to save fees in the future? Or is it to altruistically reduce the total UTXO size. 
Agreed UTXO size is an important scalability issue. Recently I've been increasing my dbcache.
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:39:05
Just showing agreement with OP. It's a cultural thing but you're new here so probably don't understand
@_date: 2016-04-02 23:35:29
Why is the witness data fee discounted by a factor of 4? Does this encourage users to consolidate UTXO sets? How does it encourage that? 
Why not just have same fee per byte apply to witness data? If witness data is fee discounted it opens an attack vector according to some people. Can you comment on that attack vector?

If you still have the html you can take a SHA256 hash of it which should be for v3.2.0: ad4fd171c647772aa76d0ce828731b01ca586596275d43a94008766b758e8736
Take note if you did "save as" in the browser and didn't pick "HTML only" then you'll get extra whitespace that the browser engine has added then the hash won't match.
Alternatively, search the HTML for "XMLHttpRequest" if you don't see that then there is no code that would post data to an external server. For more advanced analysis look for newer ES7 external calling functions:

This is a reminder to download from Github and verify hash and/or PGP signature. Github has "EV SSL" which means it cannot be tampered with if you use Chrome or Firefox (and you therefore only trust Google / Mozilla / Github).

Since SegWit is backwards compatible then existing transactions that are malleable will still be malleable. You have to use the new SegWit P2SH to get the benefit.

Interesting. From the Readme looks like they haven't defaulted it to pruning.
@_date: 2016-04-14 10:56:38
With pruning you won't serve old blocks. And there is the new bandwidth cap flag to set how much historical data you are willing to serve. Typical plans where I'm at are 3 to 5 GB per month. If you bootstrap over WiFi until you have an updated UTXO set I'm assuming bandwidth cap wouldn't be an issue.

Thank you that's what I was looking for. Hopefully it clears things up for others as well.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:32:22
OK thanks for the estimate. I guess then we'd need a way to throttle more on data and catch up on WiFi. I wonder if the ABCore below could do that since it acts as a wrapper (I assume).
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:30:05
Why does witness data cost 1/4th in the limit calculation? Why not 1/3rd? 
Signatures can be pruned is one reason. What are the other reasons? 
How does it incentivize the reduction of change addresses in wallets? Or the reduction in unspent change specifically.

After SegWit a proof of grandparent block can be added under the witness merkle root. Ensuring validationless mining can only be 1 confirmation deep. So lite clients have to only adjust their security assumptions by 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:40:20
Transaction throughput has not reached any limit other than an artificial one. Hard coded in 1 client that is losing popularity over that one constant. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:19:15
I disagree. I think we can let CONOP for exchanges to grow in cost same as we let CONOP grow for miners. We can allow for hobbyist nodes and altruistic nodes numbers to shrink. They don't provide mobile SPV wallet users any security. 
If some miners make blocks that take an exchange 11 minutes to verify and other miners make 2 minute to verify blocks and the exchanges validate these blocks in parallel (BU has this feature) then the 2 minute block with less transactions win. 
SPY mining is here but it's not a problem because compact blocks is here. Why not merge headers first mining?(if you think SPY mining is a problem) It compete with SPY mining on the P2P network. 
Today people use SPV clients and trust that miners validate transactions. I don't see how 1MB blocks helps people transact on their smartphone. Core is not making a pruned Android wallet and neither is anyone in the market. 
There does not exist an open latency problem that causes centralization pressure. What are you referring to? Seems like you are referring to pre compact block Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:46:08
The ddos causes this centralization. A node running on Google or Amazon cloud can stand up better to ddos. Nodes on smaller VPS providers are vulnerable to ddos. A home node is great but some people want to make more bandwidth available to the network.

@_date: 2017-03-29 00:49:10
The blockchain growing isn't the problem it's the solution. Pause. 
What matters is the stream of transactions and updating the "unspent transaction set". This can scale to the same rate as Netflix. There is a solution called UTXO commitments by Peter Todd. In the future you will bootstrap a node using the headers chain and a well known UTXO commitment that has a strong amount of PoW. You will use that to download the relevant UTXO data from other nodes. Just like today we skip signature validation beyond a certain block height.

You have to trust them not to cheat because they can also unilaterally close the channel and take more than owed by spending an older version of the transaction.

Bitaddress.org supports BIP38 encryption on the wallet details tab with user supplied private key.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:50:33
Those advantages are slipping away. All HW wallets support multiple alt-coins. Many mobile wallets support multiple altcoins. At least 1 desktop app supports multiple altcoins. Most exchanges support altcoins now. By end of 2017 ALL exchanges will support at least 1 altcoin.
If BitPay supports any alt... we lose a lot of network effect.
Every bitcoiner is in the process of becoming an altcoiner. If we let the trend continue Bitcoin loses it's advantage.
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:22:44
Existing off-chain solutions that in my opinion support Bitcoin such as exchanges or sites that take Bitcoin deposits like VPN or gambling site etc are great. 
Off-chain as in altcoin is not great in my opinion because it lowers demand for Bitcoin. 
Off-chain as in payment channels won't catch on in my opinion. Since they've existed for some years and we don't see examples of any two-party channels. So, I fail to believe a depository system of networked payment channels will be adopted. If you trust a third-party such that you will pre-pay then you don't need a payment channel you just send them funds like the VPN or gambling case above. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:21:02
USD and Visa and Paypal have network effect.
Chain security I agree with you is unique to Bitcoin. From the first altcoin until now Bitcoin had spare block space and low fees. We don't live in that world anymore.

Dr Emin did a study recently that showed the network has 17% more bandwidth than last year. 
I disagree the study above was incomplete. It was done before xthin/CB. So it's conclusions are even more valid. Also, if by safety margin you mean no node falls behind... I don't care if we lose 10% of nodes at 4MB.
You sound like a Dev sock puppet when you ask for a BIP and implementation. 
LN solves nothing least of which is zero conf. You obviously don't understand LN. You have to lock money with a confirmation and that money is locked with one party. With Subchains you can do retail payments that are 1 time without need to make a trust based channel. 
SegWit doesn't solve the block limit being artificial and hard to chain at runtime. It's a half solution at best for the low priority things it addresses. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:23:50
Great reply. I have much respect for you. 
Can you convince me those throughput methods will achieve 10x in transaction throughput onchain? 
I see the need for 10MB blocks to scale the community to 200 million people. To lock in the network effect and be resistant to government undermining. 
1MB + SegWit + Schnorr = 4x transaction throughput. 
Since it takes a lot of organizing and energy to get support to change the status quo, I see it as necessary to support uncapping the artificial block size limit before SegWit activation for the long-term (and short-term) benefits to Bitcoin. 
In the long run I think we need 100x scaling to be globally intrenched. I'm willing to face that in the context of the future when we solved the first order of magnitude.

@_date: 2017-03-05 03:11:47
What do you think about the idea that the 10 minute block interval can cause fee market pressure if transaction volume pushes the network nodes ability to validate blocks? Wouldn't miners throttle blocksize to make sure exchanges keep up? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:08:01
The network can handle more than 1MB blocks. There was a research paper from 2 years ago saying the existing network back then could handle 4MB. I don't care if my raspberry pi gets kicked off the network because it can't validate fast enough. I'll go spend $500 on a mini PC that will replace it. 
Read the Subchains whitepaper. It increases throughput for a given orphan rate and solves the zero conf problem. You could get sub 10 minute weak confirmations. Like every 10 seconds.

LN also presents a UX problem similar to altcoins. You have to make the balance distinction from the hub-money and mainchain-money. Using different icons or ticker symbols. Then a decision must be made for each payment about which payment method to use. Bitcoin or Lightning. How will you know the other party can receive the LN payment?

@_date: 2017-03-29 19:57:38
Or we use BTC addresses and the hubs deposit into the channel that has the specific BTC payout address? So hubs would let each other know which BTC addresses are linked to a payment channel?
And that way if user makes a mistake and sends mainchain BTC to the address then it is OK?
And the users app would tell them "no route found" if they can't deliver it through the hub network.
The need to use hubs is concerning for me. They are points of KYC/AML enforcement.

So in LN what's the equivalent of a BTC address? in a pure payment channel it's still a BTC address with 2 of 2 multisig. If I request a payment from you in LN how do I know it will reach me? Are addresses like pointbiz ? and if we use the same hub then we are sure we reach each other? Seems like we wouldn't swap BTC addresses.

I do worry about the release process. I also weigh it in context of altcoins gaining market share and that relieving fee pressure in Bitcoin whilst putting upward pressure on the price of alts and downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. 
My preferred alternative is for fee pressure to kick in when we hit the limits of what the network can bare (which changes over time). Thereby, putting downward price pressure on alts and upward on Bitcoin. 
I'm not a fan of the hostility but I feel it will sharpen knives. My preferred approach is Core sets a flag date 12 months out with a normal HF-style block limit increase. Then no one in your camp has to break loyalty. And we move forward in a more healed way. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:08:28
Yes, I read it. It was an appeal to Core devs for an orderly protocol upgrade. Core devs have said they won't steward the upgrade. If exchanges aren't prepared and BU fork reaches 100 blocks they will have to suspend deposits and withdrawals then scramble. Not ideal for those unprepared. If they upgrade in advance then transition is super smooth. 
Look for exchanges to make another announcement if BU reaches 75% hash rate.

@_date: 2017-03-28 10:41:45
Actually it means a lot. The pressure to release the artificial cap won't go away. So it's just a matter of time until other people realize it's in their best interest to be prepared by installing BU. Don't be surprised if some exchanges are running BU secretly. Which makes the most sense.

I wasn't aware you could claim the whole channel for yourself... I don't follow how that is possible. Can you link me? Either way seems like a trust issue if one party can unfairly settle with the other.
I don't see how SegWit helps outsource watching of the blockchain when you can ask a watcher service to notify you of ANY spends in from the channel that are published to the P2P network.
I spend a lot of time in r btc. Finally, we are having a debate. Maybe I missed something. My agenda is to convince people LN is vaporware and not a real solution which is a sincere belief I hold. I'm neutral on SegWit. It's the selling of LN that bothers me. Additional agenda is to scale upwards (blocksize) not outwards (altcoins). Seems r bitcoin is not sensitive to the risk altcoins play to Bitcoin dominance.
LN is held up as a solution but it requires a 6-degrees of separation network topology OR a hub/spoke Paypal 2.0 model. Much different from a full broadcast network where any two participants can reach each other through message passing.

I agree with the OP. 
It's also about priorities and the narrative. 
Core team narrative is about RBF and side chains. 
The other narrative is about block size, user onboarding and maintenance and enhancements of the existing software public goods. 
Then there is the maintenance of Bitcoin the brand which is suffering as of late. There have been moments when the well-known figures in this system have stepped up and done beneficial and altruistic things that added VALUE to the system through confidence in the people who shape and tend to the system. 
Example 
Garzik on CNN telling media the truth that Bitcoin is traceable and people who break the law with it can be tracked. This released pressure from the establishment in the early days when the response from authorities was unknown and unpredictable. 
Example 
Theymos in the early days aware of threats to hacking the original forum moved it to a separate domain so that media could not say "bitcoin was hacked" when actually just a php forum was. 
Example 
During the level DB hard fork a big mining pool operator went against a suggestion to stay with v0.8 and moved his pool back to v0.7 and reunified the chain (at his expense) and allowed Europe and North America to wake up in the morning with a unified chain. His actions ment the chain stayed under a 30 block split. There was barely a mention of it in media. 
There are other examples but those are the three that have had reputational impact on Bitcoin the brand. 
I've been here since 2011 quietly coding away at bitaddress.org trying to contribute to the public works. 
Losing Mike Hearn who was the driving force behind SPV becoming a usable thing that powers the vast majority of people and their wallets who have been on boarded has been devastatingly bad signal for me. 
The distributed ledger could power anything but what really brings it to life is the killer app of money. We are mimicking the best historical form of money gold. 
We need to be mindful that people are the bedrock of this distributed system. We have built something political here. Let's protect it from the real adversary.

Blocks don't have UTXO trees. So you lost me there. You cannot use an arbitrary old block and figure out the UTXO set from that. Are you referring to some type of merkle tree just for the UTXO commitments? With new protocol messages to retrieve this data? 
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:49:20
Long-term storage should be done with paper (or steel Google cryptosteel). Make a bootable usb drive with Linux and put a copy of bitaddress.org on a second USB drive. Make a paper wallet and print it. This is your "term deposit" or "savings account". 
Ledger / Trezor hardware wallets are great (I use Ledger) and they should be used as your "checking account". They keep the Bitcoins you carry with you safe or the ones you keep handy at home. Ledger can pair with Mycelium on Android and it's a safe and fantastic experience. And as a backup you record your recovery seed on paper hence hardware wallets require you to figure out a safe way to store paper. Which is why for investment amounts you should choose paper wallets as a first choice.

SegWit doesn't eat that up. 
What's important about CB is to level the playing field between those colluding through the centralized BlueMatt relay and the p2p network. So it does help mining significantly.

CB also competes against miners who connect to other pools and use headers first mining. Also, lowers the amount of time headers first mining is profitable.
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:00:59
I didn't misunderstand. The bottleneck is not loose transaction relay but block relay (header + transactions). The burst after a block is found. Using your number of 0.02MB for the burst then SW eats up 1/25th of this capacity (or less not more).
@_date: 2016-06-23 21:30:13
Ah yes. I follow now. An expansion of the UTXO commitment stuff has proposed on the mailing list. It's very promising for long term scaling. Archive nodes can provide this data and people won't have to go back to Genesis unless they have a transaction older than 8 years that got expired from the active UTXO set. If Bitcoin Core has a checkpoint at block X (which it does) than you can safely use the UTXO from that block and only roll forward to get today's full node trust model. Since today we don't check signatures before block X anyways.

The problem of being vulnerable when sweeping a private key is a general problem not specific to bitaddress.org. 
It's received reviews and has been in use for years. Bad address issues were resolved in 2011 in the first weeks. No other issue since served an invalid address. 
The issues cryptographers have with JavaScript has been addressed by the all-in-one HTML page. You also have to run your browser without browser extensions.

I do want to add BIP32/39 support in the future. And optionally allow for dice entropy for that seed. So, you only go through the dice roll process once. 
Perhaps someday offline signing which would be easier with BIP32 because you would need two instances of bitaddress.org one cold and one special hot edition which loads the UTXOs for the wallet and transmits that over the air gap(qr codes or audio encoding) the cold bitaddress.org could then create and sign the transaction and pass it back over the air gap.

I agree re unconfirmed transactions are not secure (notwithstanding weak blocks being added to the protocol). 
My question really is what additional security does the fraud proof provide ontop of what SPV clients do now by confirming they have the longest PoW headers chain and that transactions they care about belong to the merkle tree of blocks in that chain?

It's a network effect issue as well. SegWit is a reboot in network effect because wallets of end users need to be changed. Transaction format as well. Nakamoto consensus calls for miners to determine block size. That is the natural conclusion under the existing trust model. Bip 100 or BU are permanent solutions to this specific scaling issue. Light client (SPV) wallets and all existing mobile wallets don't need to change to support more transactions per block. So no reduction in network effect of end users. We will lose some network effect in full nodes with a HF. 
Making transactions smaller by introducing new formats are secondary in priority.

I think the ratio of full nodes with incoming port 8333 connections to other full nodes is getting worse because Bitcoin Core is not a convenient wallet nor does it secure keys well. 
I see Jonas is working on SPV mode wallet during the initial sync and that should help. 
Additionally, support for Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets is an absolute must. Or even some form of paper 2FA so that a key logger needs more than your wallet password to steal your funds. 
Focus on UX is barely exists in Bitcoin Core. Again thanks to Jonas there is BIP32 to improve UX of the back up experience. 
Also, I think we are in a CONOP crunch right now because of the change over to SSD from HDD most people don't use desktops and most don't have enough space on their SSD for the Bitcoin blockchain. Attaching a 1TB USB drive to your laptop is not a convenient solution hence people don't do it.

One block is $8750 in reward the miner would forfit that and the attack would work for 1 block before it got orphaned. There must be a reward for the attack greater than $8750. Plus the miner doesn't know the recipient is using an SPV (light) node. The light node only needs to wait 2 blocks or 3 at most if the second block was empty of transactions to defend against this attack vector. 
So as long as an SPV node waits 3 confirmations or transacts value less than the block reward they are safe.

@_date: 2016-11-13 23:52:19
OK good point. But if you wait for 6 confirmations and the second longest chain header is behind more than 6 blocks it's probably overkill to need a fraud proof. 
I guess my point is fraud proofs are cool but not necessary for trust less security because there are out of band ways to tell if miners are mining invalid blocks. And requiring a fraud proof so we can call light nodes an SPV node is not a requirement for the term. 
They would be more relevant if blocks are so huge we have to trust a handful of full nodes to validate miners. 
Today, the attack that would be mitigated by a fraud proof sent to an SPV node is not an implementable attack vector.

I wouldn't store a bip38 private key in online storage. Especially not if the password is low entropy. 
If you use a high entropy password that you might forget in that scenario (different from option A) it would be better to store the high entropy password in online storage and leave the bip38 private key offline in 2 or 3 physical locations. 
A great option is to have something online + something offline + something you memorize to protect the online material.
Option C: BIP38 paper wallet + high entropy password stored in your Dropbox protected by your Dropbox password. An attacker must make an online and physical attack against you to get your bitcoins. 
Option D:
Using the Split Wallet you could for example make 3 of 5 shares for the private key. Leave one at home on paper and one with your parents on paper and one with a lawyer on paper and two in your Dropbox online.

It's a challenge of keeping secrets and using entropy strategically. Here are two straight forward options using bitaddress.org 
Option A:
Use the Paper Wallet tab with BIP38 choose a low entropy unforgettable to you password / PIN. About 4 to 8 characters. Print 2 or 3 copies and put in different geographic locations (bank safety box, parents house, hidden at home, etc.). Do NOT write down the password. 
This option does not prevent rubber-hosing. It however, protects from physical theft by allowing you time to get to another copy and move the funds before the theif brute forces your low entropy password. 
Additionally, this option protects you from forgetting your low entropy password because you can brute force it yourself. 
Option B:
Use the Split Wallet tab and split one private key into shares (this is Shamirs Secret Sharing) distribute these geographically and to trusted persons. Be creative when choosing M of N. Think deeply about your physical persons trust network and about trusted physical spaces (secure or hidden).

There is an open task to convert the art from PNG to SVG so that it can be programmatically changed which would allow people to customize the colors and maybe the design a bit. 
As for making it read different images off disk or using newer file API of the browser to allow an image to be dragged onto the page and used are not open tasks I've considered. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 19:33:43
I respectfully disagree. 
1) point taken the software is available via a website. However, if you model the threat vector for someone tampering with the hosted software you will realize its the same threat path that a user must walk when obtaining Bitcoin Core to run locally. 
Threat path:
1a) go to well known URL for software 
1b) is the site using EV SSL. If yes, you just trust the hosting company, the browser vendor and any browser extensions not to tamper with things. If no, man-in-the-middle is a concern 
1c) both bitaddress.org and Bitcoin Core are vulnerable to browser extensions and malware on the local computer. 
1d) safest web hosting path is going to the well known Github URL for either bitaddress.org or Bitcoin Core. Github uses EV SSL and presumably is a more secure fortress than bitaddress.org or bitcoin.org
1e) to only trust the developers you must check the signature for either bitaddress.org or Bitcoin Core. 
2) cryptographers hate dynamic typed languages, I get it. They also don't like their is no standard big integer library built into the language; this can be also seen as an advantage since it will execute the same cross browser if you use a custom big integer library. The remaining critique revolves around the environment of the browser. If you run an all-in-one HTML page offline then you mitigate all their concerns. You also have to have no browser extensions running. 
3) address reuse or multiple addresses... Sure. But we are talking about safety and therefore we must model threats. Someone can mishandle a key or make a mistake with change addresses (an old problem now that everyone sweeps). 
However, the default key management solution is to use Bitcoin Core which must be used online as a hot wallet so the window of time the wallet file is available for hackers to get at and then use key logging to get the password is much greater than the threat of coins being stolen during the short window of a sweep. Also, using Bitcoin Core you must backup your wallet electronically. Like using a USB that could fail or putting it in Dropbox yikes. Bitcoin Core would be safer with a mnemonic BIP39 phrase that could be transcribed to paper. Also, Bitcoin Core needs hardware wallet support for safety. Also, it needs SPV like wallet functionality so you can quickly transfer your funds even if you are behind on the full blockchain because liquidating fast is a safety issue. Also, Bitcoin Core fully trusts the OS for entropy. Bitaddress.org xors it's PRNG with the OS one.

Maybe put in your advice for the user to decrypt the BIP38 key in the wallet details tab to avoid the Safari 6 bug that affected users. Meaning they should test the decryption works before sending money to the address.

I'm considering improving bitaddress.org to support HD wallets. Additionally, I want to provide two options for generating the master seed. 
Option 1 the existing approach (PRNG with mouse / keyboard physical entropy mixed with OS random number generator) 
Option 2 deterministically make the master seed from a series of dice rolls. No random number generator used at all just pure physical entropy. 
That improvement would solve  and  from your list. 
3 is very challenging if you don't use USB to pass the data because there is a two way data transfer. Preparing the transaction online to get previous transaction information (utxo). Then pass data to offline machine to sign. Then pass data back online (you suggest typing this out... That would be hundreds of hex characters). QR codes might help in this process but I have to think about it.

The term voting might be misleading in this context. It's actually non-binding signaling to the market. It was mentioned that the signaling could be blinded. Peter Todd would need to elaborate on that. The suggested use was "readiness signaling" for an upgrade. Similar to how launching nodes is a form of signaling. As well as version bits in mined blocks is signaling by Miners. 
It should be noted that signaling is used to improve the safety of a consensus update but that Miners are not bound by those signals as we saw recently in the Bip66 upgrade. 
The more signaling mechanisms there are in the market the more efficient the market can be.

Validity is an abstract concept. In the purest sense PoW provides a timestamping mechanism, no more. It is in the interest of those receiving rewards and fee revenue to play by the "rules" to maximize profits (valued like everything else in USD).
I advise not to listen purely to what I'm saying but do a statistical analysis of Antpool blocks and draw your own conclusions. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:32:18
Sure. In the first 20 seconds after a block is mined while it is being validated the mining gear HAS to mine something and the only economic thing to mine is a block on top of the most recent but until you validate transactions in the current block you cannot include any in the next block. If you check you'll find virtually all the Antpool empty blocks come seconds after the previous block.

I wanted to also mention that in Chrome developer tools you should be able to do a memory heap dump. (Practice on another machine first). 
If the local variable that stored the UInt8Array from window.crypto was recoverable from the heap that with the seed pool would be what you need to recreate the key. Or maybe the key itself is in the heap. It depends if it got "garbage collected" from memory.

Bitcoin.org stated during the last fork that SPV clients should wait 30 confirmations. I would rather control my private keys and wait the 30 confirmations than to run a full node or web wallet on my phone. 
Security relating to key management is the more relevant metric since the keys are the weakest link in the bitcoin security model. 
SPV nodes can be augmented to tell you themselves there is a fork in the chain. During forks wait 30 instead of 6 confirmations.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I will consider it. The wallet details tab needs better usability even with respect to compressed and uncompressed keys. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:46:13
Sorry to hear about the loss of your private key.
I don't have good news for you.
I can confirm the initialized pool is copied into this variable:
Which you can output in the console of the browser.
It won't change after it's been copied into that variable even with mouse clicks. It's the seed that was used to initialize the pool. This is made available for people who are studying the entropy collected into the pool.
However, because your browser supports window.crypto then the seed pool is XOR'd with a secure random byte array from the browser/OS in the "sr.prototype.nextBytes" function.
The seed pool is XOR'd with window.crypto in case there is a flaw or weakness in either the entropy collected in the seed pool, the SecureRandom PRNG or in window.crypto.
I know this won't help you but to alleviate this usability issue in the future I've been planning to add a "session log" to the UI (basically a textarea) where the Bitcoin Address and Private Key for all keys generated in any tab would be logged. This would help for situations like you encountered. However, it would not help for people who close their browser or refresh the page.
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:29:09
Too much risk for too little gained. Also, as a soft fork it has 2 TX ids. Also, versioning the scripting language is scary. I'm not looking for wild upgrades to the rules that are easy to deploy. Also, SPV fraud proof capabilities were left out. 
It's been a huge distraction from on-chain scaling. 
These things can get us to 32MB message limit: xthin, parallel block validation, headers-first mining. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:07:02
Both bip 100 and bip101 have a max block size limit of 32MB because further work would need to be done to bitcoin XT to address the 32MB limit (a further hard fork). 
I prefer bip100 because one of it's goals is to address the issue that max block size change requires a hard fork. Bip100 would require the same extra work as bip101 to get passed 32MB but then we can just use the same voting mechanism that bip100 uses when we are &gt;32MB. 
Miners enforce consensus through building on the valid chain. The longest chain is the valid chain. Anyone can vote with their computing power. The miners are the voters. If you don't yet understand that about Bitcoin... eventually you will if you keep digging deeper. 
The developers have a huge influence because they supply the software to the miners. 
Exchanges being on board is just good damage control.

There's forks on testnet. Still malebility. Two TX ids adds confusion. Introducing new script versions without super majority changes the nature of trust less validation. Existing address types are being overloaded instead of the initial plan of new address formats. Also, there are new classes of attacks because the structure of data is changed and the fee calculations are different (although this part I like but it's not clear it's right). 
Also, extra risky as a soft fork if there is a chain split. Because anyone can spend SegWit transactions on a non SegWit fork. 
Why take any risk? The supposed benefits are low priority at best.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:04:24
It's not a simple solution. BIP109 is the simplest approach. SegWit is just what's available as a choice today.

@_date: 2017-05-11 00:08:21
Here is the research (paper linked in article): 


Because a miner can fill a block with his own transactions that he hide from the network? Doesn't orphan rate counter that effect? 
Given that miners do some validation-less headers mining and that risk is countered by orphan risk for following an invalid block and there is therefore plenty of time for more than 1MB to transfer and validate. Making an invalid header uses PoW and costs money. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:22:27
I think we have a misunderstanding somewhere.
 


It's not impossible it's just invalid. Also, miners select transactions so you cannot control how they weigh transactions against fees so long as it's less than 4e6. They want to maximize fees for the given two buckets. Legacy 1MB + SegWit data. One fee for data that fits in one bucket legacy vs one fee for data that goes in two different sized buckets.

Bitmain/Jihan has been selling miners around $2,000 each to anyone around the globe. They are the most efficient miners on the market and hobbyist can buy and run them. He makes more money from selling miners than mining Bitcoins (according to an analysis I read). This is the "single miner" that was referred to.
Avalon miners are less efficient than Bitmain so it's harder for small scale miners to compete if they buy Avalon hardware.
BitFury who also sells miners does so at shipping container sizes starting around $10 million.
There are other miners who manufacture in China. I'm not sure if they sell their hardware or not but definitely they don't export outside China.

As a Bitcoin hodler I have an interest in Bitcoin succeeding. Both the "bitcoin" and "btc" subreddits are echo chambers where group think is prevailing. I'm trying to get information through those bubbles to allow people to think for themselves. 
SegWit lays some good foundation for future changes but it's not addressing the issue at hand. Namely that Bitcoin fees over $2 makes for a different economy and opens up a niche for other cryptocurrencies to compete. 
The moderators of this subreddits are succeeding at stirring public opinion in a direction that's not helping Bitcoin. Last year BIP109 gathered significant support to do a simple and safe increase to the block size limit to 2MB (from the current 1MB). Without enough public opinion in favor the effort failed.

OK sure let me summarize the point I'm trying to make (without humour).
Networks take network effects and in the next few weeks no one will be using Lightning for beer/coffee (aside from ideological experiments). What's the bootstrapping plan for Lightning?
Lightning network as a solution to scale the decentralized p2p Bitcoin network does not exist. Lightning network to setup payment channels between trusted parties exists (on top of SegWit); and that solution could compete with Blockstream's Liquid sidechain. I sincerely don't see it competing with Bitcoin (feature for feature).
As far as I know, you must be online for Lightning payments; publish your internet location; know every other nodes location (thanks (how to find nodes that don't take incoming connections?) to even have a chance to route (how do you know the recipient is still online?). 
I predict any Lightning-style network to need hubs; to connect to a hub you need to know it's a hub (so trust is needed); trusted hubs need AML/KYC and won't be allowed to intermediate transactions between users. Why don't any of the exchanges allow for user to user Bitcoin transfers today? The answer is regulation.
I'm open to being wrong. I'm playing the "don't believe the hype" role here. I don't see to many people doing that.

I read Peter Todd's work on larger block size leads to centralization. I don't agree with his conclusions. Parallel block validation I believe is the answer to most of his concerns. Also, compact blocks has made most of the big blocks leads to centralization arguments out-dated.
I support SegWit in the context of fixing mallaebility and the fraud proofs. I heard the fraud proof stuff didn't make it into SegWit. Can you confirm or deny this? I don't support SegWit instead of a max block size increase. I think it should happen after or in parallel. I would love to hear that SegWit supports fraud proofs for all Bitcoin consensus rules. 
Initial block sync is not an issue because the solution is UTXO commitments. I'm a big fan of Peter Todd's work on that. And hope it makes it into Bitcoin.
There was academic research two years ago showing 4MB blocks could be handled by the network and more research that shows that's now double. Dr. Gun Sirer's work.
I have a mobile wallet and a full node (non-economic). If block height matches on both then I'm good.
All full nodes I'm aware of do not support hardware wallets. Seriously, the added privacy is not worth the security risk.

SegWit with any discount creates that NP-hard problem. You can't just sort by weight and call it a day because other approaches that consider the 1MB space (non-witness + witness) vs the 3MB space (SegWit witness only). Two price buckets is two price buckets.

There is a lot of group think in this sub (in the other too). LN code speaks for itself. As per the LN developer he informed us that the current implementation uses direct connections and does NOT solve the decentralized routing problem. He has a proposed solution to pass around the full network graph. So users of the LN network are full-node type clients (they need a Bitcoin/Litecoin full node UTXO) that must stay online.
Average users don't run full nodes. 
Payment channels exist but I don't see them being used.

You're playing with words. The word "confirmation" existed long before Bitcoin but it means something specific in the context of Bitcoin.
LN has almost zero chance of success with 1 or 2MB blocks. You have to consider value of transaction fee vs cost to spend a UTXO vs cost to open/close a channel and how much value will be put into an average channel. There is a bunch of unknowns so no one knows how the game theory will play out for a system with no double spending protection that requires you settle on chain when you don't know what an appropriate fee is to settle on chain. Your "pre-signed" transaction from last month might not have enough fees to confirm onchain.
If LN wasn't complicated enough try figuring out how to CPFP on your LN settlement transaction when you're under time pressure. It's not adversarially secure.
LN's secure assumptions are broken if you cannot settle onchain in a timely fashion with a predictable fee.

The health of the network is currently unreliable. The referenced work is discussing a future where Bitcoin doesn't mitigate the issue of miners dwelling on a large fee transaction when block reward is 0. The article mentions a solution from Peter Todd (mine after lock time). Another mitigation is Subchains/Weak-blocks where sub-blocks with lessor difficultly (decentralizing effect) and shorter intervals are mined and then aggrated into a strong-block. Another solution is to PoW the transactions themselves. That would even decentralize the network further. 


Miners could soft-fork in a change to self limit their block sizes... Oh wait they don't need a rule change to do that and it's in their economic incentive to limit the block size to enforce a base fee.

There are pressure's that limit block size. One is the 10 minute interval which puts a physical limit on what can traverse the network in a given interval. The other is orphan rate.
The requirements to run a full node can increase drastically with no cap. That would mean Bitcoin is wildly more successful than today because it's used more.
I'm not here to defend the BU team. I'll take BIP103 if that's all Core would implement.

@_date: 2017-05-10 19:58:06
For Lightning to be able to reliably route the only proposed solutions are awareness of the entire network graph OR a hub-and-spoke model. 
"Hubs" makes it like Coinbase/Paypal. I don't see how that's misleading.
I take back if 1 hub goes down you can't send payments. Assuming there are multiple big hubs then you can go with another one. Not exactly monetary sovereignty we have with layer 1.

@_date: 2017-05-10 16:44:45
Thanks for the reply. I follow you and agree, if all nodes and their locations are known then Dijkstra's algorithm can work.
Do you see challenges in discovering the full graph? Do all LN nodes need to have an open port?
No one knows the full Bitcoin network graph; just the open port nodes graph.
Does LN still require nodes to be online to receive payments? Or continuously online?
How is the channel handshaking done? The demo's I've seen use copy/pasting meaning nodes are not auto-discovering each other or auto handshaking to setup channels.
Do you have concern that nodes need to carry value (hot wallets) and publish their locations and stay online continuously?
On main chain I can receive a payment without publishing my internet location or being online.

I don't believe wildly different block sizes will be signaled with BU. If you look at all BU miners they are signaling the same size. I believe it will roughly work out like BIP100 which is a controlled upgrade through miner signaling. 
I don't think non-mining BU node signaling does anything other than provide bandwidth to propagate big blocks. 
I run BU. Call me crazy. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:35:55
This sub can't admit a simple block size increase is better than SegWit. Last year people here didn't want more scaling now they call SegWit a scaling solution and it's not. You only get half the story here. Search for "reddit btc" for the other half.

Yes. That was all embarrassing. The fork should have been predictable because BU didn't support BIP109. I guess we shouldn't expect any two dev teams to agree by default.
Personally, I see the big block camp as two groups (with some overlap). Group 1 supports modest fixed block limit increases (20MB, 8MB, 2MB). Group 2 supports uncapping (XT, BU) (of course both XT and BU have caps but exchanges are no longer consulted after the initial rollout).
I fall more into Group 1. It seems big blockers waiver between these two extremes as a reaction to small blockers. I see small blockers (Group 0) wavering into Group 1 sympathy... more and more these days.

I don't think you meant that. Confirmation requires PoW. I think 10 second confirmations might be possible one day with Subchains/WeakBlocks.
LN has a chance at becoming a mobile payments standard if they find a way to bootstrap many well branded hubs. And I can connect to a hub without giving my name/identity and still do normal retail payments. Otherwise, how is it better than Visa?

I know what you mean. O(N-squared) scaling. Blockchains do scale and the very very first criticism of Bitcoin when I discovered it in 2011 was that it "wouldn't scale". We still have to bust that myth.
Miners, exchanges and block explorers will verify the consensus rules. Fraud-proofs for the rest of us (improved SPV wallets). That's how Bitcoin works today (very few people use full nodes as wallets).
1MB blocks = 20 million users (holders not coffee). 10MB blocks = 200 million users. Home users can validate 10MB blocks. By the time we need 100MB blocks either technology will catch up or as is done today miners, exchanges and block explorers run full nodes and validate. There only needs to be a few honest full node operator to tell people something went wrong. It's hard to cheat a blockchain without people noticing.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:20:22
I think you are projecting. What technical reason do you have to support UASF and not bigger blocks? 
Do you understand that chain forks don't fit nicely into two buckets (soft or hard)? 
Are you aware UASF in the BIP148 sense has never been attempted before? 
Do you understand Moore's "law"? 
Do you appreciate that hard forking is the governance model of Bitcoin? 
Did you know SegWit introduces a dual pricing model for block space? Did you know the extra space made available by SegWit is less efficiently used because it can only store signatures or spam but not traditional transactions? Did you know SegWit decouples the incentives for miners to download signatures to receive fees? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:43:21




Despite the ad hominem attack I feel it necessary to correct you (for the readers). Not only is weight fictitious, to make the math easier, there are two different groups of people bidding for the Bitcoin block space compared to the SegWit extension block space. Meaning there will be a price divergence and in no way will the cost of Bitcoin block space be bounded to 4x the cost of SegWit extention space. Meaning that rational miners will not select transactions based on weight. At first it is likely SegWit extension space will be free since it will be hard to fill the 3MB. Miners will select transactions based on who pays more for the base Bitcoin block space. Transaction selection and fee paid per anything are not consensus rules. The only rules that must be followed is 1MB for Bitcoin block space and 3MB for SegWit block space. 




It's a form of validation-less mining. The signature for SegWit coins are not needed to be downloaded to update the UTXO database.

@_date: 2017-07-02 18:29:40
Thank you for the thoughtful response. 


The UTXO must grow for Bitcoin adoption to increase. I wouldn't conflate usage with bloat. Yes, blockchains are not elegant because of data growth but it's the only known solution to double spending. 


BIP16 roll out never involved validating nodes rejecting miner blocks that were previously valid. 


Yeah, it shows memory cost going down. 


Thank you for acknowledging there was a non controversial hard fork deployed. Can you substantiate your claim about older clients, I have not heard that before and don't follow your logic? 


I gave up trying to convince I will try with you. Core made a simplified block weight calculation but it is by no means fee maximizing. There is 1MB main chain space and 3MB in the SegWit extension both have a different per byte fee. Which makes fee maximizing a difficult problem. Hence why core implemented a simplified solution which doesn't maximize fee income per block. In layman's term there are two buckets. 


I don't understand can you elaborate? 




Only with SegWit transactions can you mine on top of transactions you have not seen signatures for. See Peter Rizun talk from the future of Bitcoin conference. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:03:48
It's not more efficient. SegWit transactions are not smaller (maybe they could be one day with Schnorr but not necessarily for 2 in 2 out typical transactions). It adds technical debt arguably. It doesn't remove any technical debt for traditional transactions such as quadratic hashing issue (this is bad. BIP109 had a solution for this). Doesn't fix mallaebility for traditional transactions (although that's OK).
Lightning Network can work without SegWit but the main LN developers don't want to adapt their code to a malleable transaction format (understandably). I predict LN to be underwhelming. The same way payment channels are not widely used. The same way CSV is not widely used.
CSV apparently is a great technology to use for safe-guarding Bitcoins and passing them on to family after death. Yet, virtually no one is using it for that purpose. 
Some very cool tech doesn't get used if it doesn't meet market needs in a practical way.

Sounds like you are coming from a noble place. I've felt similar about the urgency of our circumstances. However, for me the concern started in 2015. 
I don't agree about "who" is dragging their feet. All along I've been unwilling to support a "forcible fork" (not using HF/SF cause those terms are too vague for these circumstances). 
Optimization of SHA 256 is not an attack. The concern should ONLY be the patent. Which is held by different people in the USA and China. 
That said a think the SegWit commitment is a convenient feature in the sense that it simplifies the PoW by nullifying the optimization. 
Would you support a well planned HF to upgrade the base blocksize after SegWit activates?

The fact that core has release announcements means there is a decision making mechanism and therefore a voice for the project. Your claim that "core is and is not" is just double speak.

Core team has not released the UASF binaries.
