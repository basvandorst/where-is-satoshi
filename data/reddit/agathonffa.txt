Continued adoption by users and (moreso) investors.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:50:27
I'll open the bidding at 2 satoshi.

Yes. Just like any other financial asset, really. For its use case, bitcoin is tiny compared to its potential market cap (compare it to gold, for instance), so there is a lot of room for growth.

I think you're underestimating the first mover advantage. Myspace is to bitcoin's network effects what tulips are to bitcoin's price: everyone thinks they're calling the top, and yet bitcoin doesn't seem to care.

Start saving fiat to pay for the trip. You don't want to go back on your word.

Coinbase. You can have your first BTC in about 15 minutes.

At $15, it really doesn't matter what strategy you use. "Investments" is probably too strong a term when you're at that level.
Still, welcome aboard.

Coinbase's fees are pretty small, all things considered. You miss out more by waiting several days for money to move than you do paying the 1.5% they charge to lock in a price instantly.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:29:11
Absolutely not! If you join now you will still be an early adopter, in retrospect. Welcome aboard.

What Visa- or MC-backed debit cards are available outside of Bitpay? I'm in one of the few remaining states where Coinbase still can't offer its card.

Every factor you cite was worse several years ago. Bitcoin is more established now, less likely to be interfered with by government, more likely to weather such interference should it happen, and [less likely to go away]( via the sudden whim of the masses.
Mind you, I'm not saying that bitcoin isn't risky. It absolutely is. I'm just saying that with its growth has come a reduction in risk. It is *less risky* than it was several years ago, not more.

You assume that a lack of velocity means BTC will drop in price — that bitcoin's value is derived from its use as a medium of exchange. I disagree with the premise; in my view, bitcoin's success as a store of value is logically and economically prior to its widespread use as a medium of exchange.

Welcome aboard!

You've got it nearly backwards. As the price rises, risk goes *down* — not up — and the potential reward decreases. These things are two sides of the same coin.
If you want to talk about risk, let's talk about buying in 2011, when one felt like one was just flushing money down the toilet to play with a funny Internet-based proof of concept. One that could be killed by a bug, competing crypto, or government in a heartbeat. *That* was real risk environment.

The technology is of course important. Not sure how you got that from what I said. The point is that you are making a bad assumption when you ask, What technical feature does bitcoin have that is unique?, as though that proves something about its current place as the dominant cryptocurrency.
I don't think anyone is saying it is *impossible* for another coin to take over. (What if a severe security flaw is discovered in BTC next week that drives its value to near zero? Surely another coin will emerge as the leader in that case.) But the property *having a unique technical feature* isn't what makes a currency likely to dominate. Liquidity is far, far, far more important.

"Censorship" seems like the wrong word to me. It implies that the foundation of personal liberty is speech, whereas I would say the real foundation is property. And bitcoin presents a way to control your wealth that is resistant to intervention by others (especially governments). That's not free speech; that's private property.

Congrats! Think of it as 100 mBTC. In five years even having a few whole mBTC could be seen as "lucky" in the way people today covet those who have been around since 2011.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:21:09
Those are features of the currency. If you meant to ask the narrower question, What technical, programmed features does bitcoin have that all of these clones of bitcoin, in their many permutations, do not?, then the answer is twofold: (1) none, and (2) so what? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:10:49
BTC has unmatched network effects and the greatest liquidity of all coins. These advantages are exceedingly easy to underestimate — in fact, they are nearly the only thing that matters when it comes to knowing who the winner is in the crypto space.

Assuming linear growth — I found yer problem. I wouldn't be too concerned; happens to a lot of people. Easy to fix, too.
Also, Segwit tx percentage doesn't have to be 100% for us to consider it implemented. A simple majority is a better indicator, if we want to go by gross ballpark estimates.

Well, that's not how the layman is going to see it. The dollar price of one bitcoin routinely drops more in a few seconds than what an entire bitcoin was was worth in 2012, and nobody bats an eye. In 2025 no one will care much when it goes from $1M to $0.99M in the span of a few seconds. They will talk about big drops when the percentage shifts significantly.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:42:01
In 2025 if one coin = $1M usd, and the price drops by 1% . . . you're saying that is a "bigger" fall than when bitcoin lost 70% of its value in 2014? Fourteen times bigger?

What, to an address where you can donate to me? Sure!
Seriously, though -- not sure what you are asking for.

If he had briefly held up a QR code to a BTC address, I bet he'd have made a few thousand bucks off the prank.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:06:02
He could be right, but I wouldn't bet on linear growth. I 'member back when people were chortling over 1% Segwit adoption, saying it'd take a hundred years (or whatever).
