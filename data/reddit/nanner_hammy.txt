Wouldn’t someone with substantial wealth in real estate benefit most from inflation? Genuinely asking.

Would you recommend a certain book? I like your idea I am going to find him a book also.

I was young and naive, wanted to like Obama and those in power, but thier actions speak volumes.  Total war mongering, public surveilling, liars--among other things.  Hey, they did some good but that cannot excuse the bad.

Is this movement partly in reaponse to the goldman sachs news? Or has that been out for a while I only read about it yesterday. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:19:26
I agree with that, although some people have a phycological thing with legitimacy and the instituations they are used to.  I could imagine some baby boomers thinking that news is a green light.  But you know, maybe btc is just doing its damn thing.

Thank you kind internet stranger.  I just found some  more wallet specific info over at r/bitcoinbeginners  if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:49:05
If your bitcoin is not on an exchange how do you get free coins?
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:16:53
This article says tether may be being used to manipulate markets, could someone please explain to me how that could be done?
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:13:21
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:57:28
Could you elaborate on why that is wrong? I will look into the book also
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:34:26
Thanks for the reply, does this also apply to BCH? For example if I had some bitcoin just sitting in a wallet since before the BCH fork, after segwit2x fork will I then be able to eventually access an equal number of btc, bch, and 2x coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:00:43
Wow, crazy that it could potentially be worth that much.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:11:34
I think talking about finances is a really touchy subject, even with close friends jealousy or feelings of resentment can build when talking about money.  Also people can think they are entitled to have an opinion on how you should use your money.   I am guilty of saying too much about it when talking to people about bitcoin, especially with freinds they always ask.

This is Houston, you fellows strapped in?
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:05:38
I'll take it. Haha.  What kind if time frame are you predicting this to possibly happen in?
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:14:38
Oh man.  I sold a gold coin my grandfather gave me and I will always regret it.  This reminded me.  
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:47:04
So 1 btc = 100,000,000 usd?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:31:38
It was worth it
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:04:01
Thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:08:42
Yeah, you are totally right.  I got excited but then I realized that is exactly what he wants.

Penny saved is a penny earned.  Potatoes are also a better value than ramen, nutritionally at least.  Hope you look back on this time with a fat smile and a fat bank roll bud.

Im a little behind, where do I learn more about this and which wallet should I be using?

Music also sucked in the 90s and there is good rap being produced today but probably most music is crap.  "Music was better when I was younger" -everyone that ever lived

Hahaha right, post this to fb and ask your contacts to pitch it to keep this from happening.

Oh man this gets me out of bed.  So I have to ask: when he said, “eat my dick” did he mean like some kind of contortionist auto-blowjob or more of a Hannibal Lector-esque snack?

I feel like most people take technology for granted and don't really know how it works, but it does, and in a way that they can use.  Many people operate cars or computers without understanding the technology in great detail.  So once bitcoin transactions are fool proof easy to use, people will adopt.  Is lightning network fast and easy to use for buying coffee or a pint?  I Have been hearing about it but I have never used it or anything.

Government doesn't benefit from this directly; only indirectly via their loans being easier to pay off over time as inflation increases.
Do you foresee a period of increased inflation in the U.S. soon because of the national debt, or other reasons?
