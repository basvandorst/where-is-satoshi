Thank you, this is exactly my sentiment. I love Bitcoin, but I stopped being involved when it turned into a sketchy stock market. I've tried to express this here, but it's not a well received position.
All I can think now is "I wonder when the next suicide stickies come out after a whale crashes the market again."

I got mine after about an hour. "Eli5 sent $0.02 from coinbase."

69% vs 20% now.

They kind of did intentionally shaft the guy... I mean it was a joke to them and to prove a point, but they did shaft him none the less.

Because all they thieves I've heard of steal it and go "instead of that private island, I'm going to invest in the infrustructure of the USD!"

So you agree, it has no use as a currency. It's only value is currently it's ability to increase in value and bring rewards to investors. It's a speculative asset.

That's not even a reply. I intimately understand Bitcoin and I absolutely want it to succeed - but as a currency and it's underlying technology. It's disappointing to see that viability being destroyed like this.

This isn't really a good thing. Volatility like this only solidifies people thinking it's a scheme and destroys it's viability as an actual currency...

That's a self conflicting paragraph.
"It's his fault his identity was found by doing simple cross-checks and following the bitcoin around." It took the guy 10 minutes, and he wasn't someone who would actually want that money. He just wanted to show how easy it way.
"We have to embrace anonymity" - even though the entire premise of this new service is the ability to query transactions and even read little comments they made with the purchase? This makes the process THAT much easier. This would ruin any chance you had at covering tracks, would it not?
When I use a credit card - I know nobody can see that transaction but me, my credit company, and the store. For sure. Nobody. When I spend a bitcoin - everyone on the bitcoin network can see that. Nomatter what I do, no matter how many "transaction accounts" I go threw, I'm on the list of users that handled that money. And as proven by the person I referenced - it really is THAT simple. 
That's one of the major flaws in the Bitcoin network. I shouldn't have to "cover my tracks", that just makes Bitcoin more inconvenient for me to use.
So either go full out in the open - everything can be seen, including queries. Or go full anon - nobody can see anything that's not explicitly shared. A middle ground just leads to trouble.
But again, I'm no guru - correct me if I'm wrong. This is just what I know from research.

Jesus, how do you think depressions are caused? You think everyone just says "I guess it's time we get really poor, really fast! Burn all the money!" 
No. It happens without people knowing, without people giving consent. Lives are ruined with your kind of "screw everyone that isn't lucky enough" thinking.
Do you honestly think things like the Great Depression were publicly known before the Great Depression hit?

You asked what we thought of logging queries - yes.
I'm not currently a bitcoin user, but I've done research and I watch these forums from time to time. Look at [this post]( He points out the problems with being able to look about the bitcoin transfers. You can easily identify who has what and so on.
It only makes sense to allow queries to be anaylzed as well. That post makes a good example. If searches were logged, the police or individual themselves could poke around the query log to see if anybody had been tracking them down.
That's just my two cents though.
