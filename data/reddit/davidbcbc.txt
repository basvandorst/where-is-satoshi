That's just what people want, so their analysis show that. If I was in a short position I would post analysis showing that there is still room to fall.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:29:46
So 1 million by late 2020 and 250.000 by 2022, maybe both happen.
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:29:33
the reality is I bought 1btc at approx. 6100$ and I'm 1000$ in profit after that fall. Time in the market beats timing the market :) Gonna hodl for years as long as it takes until we reach the moon.
@_date: 2018-09-22 14:21:04
With that logic, gold is a bubble.
Big fluctuations in price are due to low liquidity.
@_date: 2018-09-23 09:22:33
We have a loser here, get some sense of humor man.
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:29:12
Full of broken cryptos...
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:25:30
based on what?  
My technical analysis says 5.7k or close to that figure is the bottom, and that's why I bought.
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:53:38
Can't lose if I don't sell. And hey, if it goes lower I'll buy some more cheaper.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:16:56
So never, lots of people using it and willing to use it even more
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:12:12
so 4k huh? You see, predictions are based on something, be it data or technical analysis or whatever. What you did was just random guesses.
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:52:28
Coinbase as well
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:14:35
I bought 0.23 at 8100$, and 0.40 at 6100$, so I'm in a little loss right now but nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:32:43
Damn sorry, my break even point was 6850$ so into profit land now :)
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:25:15
That's not failing, the level got tested and it bounced back up, so the level held even if it got a bit lower for a moment.
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:53:58
I live with my parents and my monthly expenses are 0€. 100% of my paychecks go to savings. I'm buying some btc each month until I have 1 btc. So 0.36 more to go.
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:01:13
Nah, I've been trading forex for many years. With bitcoin it's different though, I'm actually holding the asset, I have 1 btc and I will have it forever even if its dollar value equals 0$. Will the price never increase ever in history? Not likely, so I'll be making a profit with 99.9% certainty.  If it goes down now it'll be just a floating loss with no rollover fees, so I can wait.
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:25:47
They probably got hacked.
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:40:26
Well, if you think that I am more confident on buying. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:47:48
I've seen that scam in all of John Mcafee's posts on twitter. There is a "Bitcoin left counter" on the giveaway site and if you reload the page it's always the same number.
Just be more careful next time, sorry man.
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:57:59
First month with a price increase since July 2018. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:15:42
@_date: 2019-03-10 19:56:48
Even worse, you got 500$ with no effort and lost it to a 100% obvious scammer. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 18:33:56
He is from the future, bull run confirmed
@_date: 2019-03-18 20:27:34
Bullrun confirmed
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:12:36
I'll buy 5 more at that price, so not gonna happen
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:01:46
don't even bother mining with a laptop. You will make close to nothing while using electricity and probably killing the laptop due to high temperature.
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:54:17
Let me guess, you have no fiat to turn into bitcoin and you want it to fail so that people don't make money and you don't miss out.

@_date: 2018-10-22 12:19:30
You could have big volume of people selling or buying, so really what we want is bulls!!
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:52:34
A massive bull ran that lasts until the sun explodes.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:43:13
If the same thing happened over and over again it would be free money for everyone. The graph you posted shows a massive bull ran and no signs of stopping
@_date: 2018-10-08 09:21:01
It's like a tsunami, you ask where all the water went and before you know it a massive wave comes.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:22:45
I very much doubt they did.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:17:46
When people are convinced we are going down that's when the bullrun begins
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:03:08
Already ordered my lambo. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:13:05
4k broken on coinbase
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:47:25
I'll buy 2 more if that happens. So it probably won't happen. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:12:52
Buy a 1200$ phone to store your 0.00034 BTC. HODL!! 
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:16:17
What if you send all the coins you have to an exchange and then to a new wallet of yours? Wouldn't that make it untraceable for coinmama or anyone else?
@_date: 2018-11-05 22:12:08
He has plenty of money to cover his positions even if they are in a big loss. He could keep a short position opened for as long as he wanted. That's what I meant.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:23:54
I've been a hodler for years now, this was just for fun :D
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:20:00
I'm not paying with my btc knowing they are so undervalued atm.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:43:12
So you have no fiat to buy btc and want it to fail so other people don't profit either. Keep crying ;)
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:58:54
When the first car was made everyone said the same. Now everyone has 1 or more. Bitcoin has only been around for 10 years and most people don't even know about it. Just wait and see.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:08:05
Of course of course... and here you are, a succesful man like you with a 4-week old account saying bitcoin is dying. Wasn't it dying when you bought in the first place or you just think it's dying because you sold all you had? Oh and why do you post all those details about your life? You come across as insecure.
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:44:56
There are no margin calls for Warren Buffet... if he doesn't short it it's because he doesn't think it is going down, otherwise why pass on easy money?
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:51:26
Why buy high and sell low? Just keep the btc until it comes back up man. I'm a few thousands in the negative but I'm not selling my btc for a loss, even if it takes years.
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:00:39
So true
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:30:08
Check the historical logarithmic chart and tell me we are not in a massive bull run and this is just a correction.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:23:06
What if it does happen, will you eat yours? :)
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:58:37
Price shooting up on Coinbase
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:27:34
It is, it's a technology in its infancy. You can't expect bitcoin to go from not existing to massive adoption in 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:04:58
You buy/sell something and the government doesn't know about it, you pay 0% tax on it. That is huge.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:50:38
Your rules make you lose money.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:25:57
This is way bigger than all of that. It allows people to have money or use it to pay for things anonimously and without any banks or institutions.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:18:35
This made me chuckle.
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:09:29
Switch banks, mine is paying me 1% up to 15k€ (I'm in Spain)
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:19:47
Huge adoption, moon soon. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:21:26
We had the same move in 2015, followed by a 40% correction and then a 100x price increase. That would take us somewhere between 300k to 1mil. Well, maybe mcafee will keep his dick after all.
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:16:08
Show me your short position
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:01:58
Being p2p there's no need to declare it. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:11:31
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:21:19
4k right now 
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:24:16
It isn't arbitrary and it's a very important level in forex. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 20:58:09
Sure, go short with a stop loss at 4100
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:17:04
Seeing this move on the 200ma gives me some hope. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:09:07
I'll be excited if we reach $4300
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:12:08
Using coinbase price the 200 moving average is 3170$ aprox. and we are right there atm. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:07:30
Selling cheap eh? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:24:01
We are at the 200 weekly MA so a lot of support at this level (around 3100$) is expected. If the support fails... well let's just hope it doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:37:41
It means support/resistance. It works because it is widely used. Just like fibonacci levels, etc. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:14:03
Yes, it has happened before. When it happened in 2015 the price increased 100x in the next 2 years.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:54:35
You can select different exchanges on tradingview
@_date: 2019-05-01 22:11:17
1000€ per BTC last month, not bad
