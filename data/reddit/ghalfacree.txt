No, you just realised a $99 gain and would be expected to pay tax accordingly on $99, not $990 - the rest of your gains remain unrealised and untaxed in the original asset (i.e. Bitcoin.)

Thanks for the pointer about batched transactions via Electrum. I'd been looking for a way to do it with the Ledger software and came up short, so ended up giving people their Bitcoin Xmas gifts in individual transactions - so I'd also like to apologise to everyone for not making efficient use of the available blockspace!
Next time, I'll fire up Electrum and batch the transactions. Thankfully, I did them early in December and the fees weren't too bad.

I can think of plenty of scenarios in which a buggy on-chain wallet could cause loss of funds: incorrect validation of the recipient address, incorrect generation of the change address, incorrect decoding of a QR code, incorrect display of the units resulting in you sending 10 bitcoins instead of 10 millibits, and, topically, overestimation of the fee required for a given transaction to name but five.
Which is why, like the Lightning devs, you *test*.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:53:16
You can't, unless they've registered a premium rate service.
@_date: 2017-02-03 07:39:17
I'm saddened to find that you'd go to such illogical lengths to welch on just $20. Read your own thread title: "20usd bitcoin reward for who can solve this: So I tried to pay for my car with bitcoin, but after 12 hours still 0 confirmations.. Any way to speed up this proces?"
Does that, or does that not, say that you'll pay $20 to anyone who can solve the problem of slow confirmations? Did I, or did I not, solve the problem of slow confirmations?
Still, if you're happy being remembered as the guy who would welch on a $20 promise, then I guess that's your lookout.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:06:21
Premium rate SMS - they're used a lot for charity donations. You can donate fixed amounts, like £5 or £10, by sending a message to a particular number; that amount is then added to your next bill, or taken off your balance if you're using a pay-as-you-go (pre-paid) SIM.
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:56:56
Congratulations! Now, how's about paying the $20 for assistance in unsticking the transaction - you know, like you promised to in your still-very-visible post title?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:24:08
Well, I've sent a bunch of emails and even a Twitter DM in a flat panic over this, and turns out I needn't have worried: just had a reply from Coinbase apologising for the problem, traced back to a deposit made when the site was having some back-end issues, and restoring my account to a fully working order - less than an hour after reporting the issue. Nicely done, Coinbase. Nicely done.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:32:32
Doesn't really help when you don't know the address: GDAX-to-Coinbase (and vice-versa) transactions are off-chain.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:12:14
Yup - all sorted, balance restored!
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:39:46
Yes, as part of an effort to - and I quote - "improve liquidity" for those making use of the new margin trading feature. You know, the one you need to have invested $5 million in aggregate to access.
Handy, eh?(!)
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:32:58
Had my reply in under an hour, and the problem was fixed to boot. Unexpected, but certainly not unwelcome!

It's basically a bribe to make you feel good about ViaBTC: they sick a handful of low-fee transactions in each block and sacrifice the lost fee revenue for people thinking "aren't ViaBTC fantastic, I'll definitely listen to them on topics like whether we should adopt SegWit or not."
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:49:36
I wrote up my experience late last year.
[Here you go]( TL;DR: it went well.
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:28:59
Looks like the transaction's confirming now, through the ViaBTC Accelerator. I'll gratefully accept the reward to 12wpUJ4H833yztG5ar7zWtorhwHj1kJFWm and I promise to spend it unwisely!
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:58:12
There are a couple of technical ways to unstick the transaction, like Child Pays For Parent, but the easiest and therefore first thing to try is sticking your transaction ID into the [ViaBTC Transaction Accelerator]( It's free, and will get your transaction confirmed in the next block they mine.
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:37:27
Great, but got said you would pay $20 to anyone who could unstick the transaction. I unstuck the transaction. So, I'd quite like the $20 that was promised, if you don't mind.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:53:44
Alludes. To elude is to successfully avoid danger or capture, as in "the suspect eluded police."

Absolutely nothing. Welcome to the wonderful world of Bitcoin, the wholly traceable digital currency!
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:43:54
You seem to have deleted your post without paying the promised $20 bounty. I'm sure it's an oversight during the excitement collecting your new car. You wouldn't welch, now, would you?

Cash deposit is one of the payment options on Bitsquare: the seller literally walks into a branch of your bank with a fistful of cash and says "please put this into account X."
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:26:32
You could, if there were more than two buyers on Bitsquare's GBP market right now...
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:48:25
Yeah, Bitsquare's creator admits the onboarding process for buyers isn't ideal - but we're seeing more and more ways of buying Bitcoin in-person cropping up. I could see someone, for example, buying enough for the security deposit at a Bitcoin ATM or ~~Norway's~~ Switzerland's train ticket machines at their above-market rates, then using that to buy a larger amount on Bitsquare at a considerably more favourable rate.
It's convoluted, though, and presupposes that someone is Bitcoin savvy enough to know about Bitsquare and how to use it but doesn't currently own any Bitcoin or know anyone who could spot them the security deposit. Unless a solution can be found - like a partnership with a Bitcoin ATM company which lets people press an "I need to pay a security deposit to Bitsquare" button and shove coins in the slot until it's paid - then Bitsquare's always going to be a platform for well-established cryptocurrency users.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:39:19
My point, though, is that "hard to chargeback" is not the same as "impossible to chargeback." Glad to hear that you've been trading successfully, though - increases my confidence that I'm not about to be ripped off!
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:59:08
I'm not worried about payment methods being unreliable in general, though; I'm worried about the very specific scenario where I've just given some complete stranger 1 Bitcoin in exchange for £620 which could, if said stranger turns out to have stolen somebody's bank account, be taken away from me again...
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:49:12
Sounds like you're after the [FSF NeuG]( I've got one inside my server - it's pretty neat!
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:05:12
It's difficult, but not impossible - for example, if you can prove your account was hijacked the bank will refund the money and chase the receiving bank for the transfer back. As far as I'm aware, that's also the case in the Netherlands: difficult, but not impossible.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:08:58
I'd forgotten which country it was that launched the service. I've been to Norway, incidentally, but never Switzerland!
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:41:12
No, it wasn't a SEPA transfer; I was paid through the [Faster Payments Service]( Officially, "a Faster Payment cannot be reversed" - but that's not strictly speaking true. As per the [official I Dun Goofed Guide]( a sender can request a reversal under the credit payment recovery process, but that's not a risk here because it requires the recipient to say "yes, they made a mistake, I'm happy for you to give them the money back."
If the recipient [cries fraud, though,]( their bank will - if they believe them - refund the payment out of their own pocket. Because banks aren't in the business of giving money away, though, they'll then chase the debt with the recipient bank - which, usually, means the recipient's bank account will be frozen while the fraud is investigated, and the money potentially removed. More worrying is the possibility the bank decides you were in on the fraud, in which case you can expect an account closure and a visit from the lads in blue to follow.
Thankfully, this is all pretty unlikely in the UK - but it's certainly something to be bearing in mind when using these kinds of payment methods!
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:27:28
~~Yes, but it's a simple one: it only shows the number of successful transactions associated with a client, as far as I can tell. Pretty easy to game by making a bunch of small deals before going in for the kill, but better than nothing.~~
Turns out it doesn't have a reputation system, as per [comment](
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:26:04
Great fishing in Norway, though. Had a massive cod get away on a snapped line in Bergen, but lunch was saved thanks to a couple of mackerel that found my lure made from a coin irresistible.
(Oh, and I find I mentally associate Switzerland more with neutrality and "Nazi gold? What Nazi gold?" than mountains!)
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:18:33
Yup, even bank holidays, though the guaranteed processing time on weekends varies bank-to-bank. You can still expect the payment to have cleared within the hour, though.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:49:00
Yes, spreading your sales out over a period of time increases the chances of a stolen bank account being discovered and frozen before you're completely bereft of Bitcoin - but doesn't do much to help with the fallout of what you'd already managed to sell, vis-a-vis your own bank account being frozen as part of a fraud investigation. Multiple transfers from the same account over several days will also likely trigger your own bank's fraud prevention systems and cause an investigation as part of their AML measures.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:45:07
That protects you from having your main account frozen, assuming you choose a different bank, but doesn't prevent the transfer being reversed; it just means if the transfer is reversed and you've already withdrawn the money the account will go overdrawn and you'll be chased by debt collectors.
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:29:13
UK, and overdrafts are a standard thing here: if something makes your account go overdrawn and you don't have an agreed overdraft, you can expect a hefty rate of interest and a fine to be charged (making you even more overdrawn, of course.)
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:46:45
I'll get in on that action, if you don't mind: 18pKprroGp9aJVjjvkhnvdVE3Pyru6WMUZ
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:38:20
Depends entirely upon the bank. Some have 2FA terminals which use your debit card chip; others use an automated IVR call to your registered phone number when you try to make a payment to a recipient you've not previously used before. I don't know of any that don't have any form of verification at all once you're logged in, but equally I can't promise they don't exist.
Naturally, you can also make these payments in-person at a bank - which would simply require you to have the person's debit card, a convincing signature, and not mind appearing on half a dozen CCTV cameras.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:59:44
This particular transaction used the Faster Payments Service, which typically clears in minutes when it's between accounts in the same bank and an hour or so between banks - and there are no fees associated with it, either.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:38:27
That sounds like a fantastic idea - happy to provide info on UK banks for this!
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:42:11
Yes, that's absolutely true, and something Bitsquare is going to have to think about going forward. ~~There's a reputation system built-in, showing how many successful trades each client has had.~~ Perhaps new clients should be limited to a certain number of simultaneous trades until they've been trading for a certain number of trades and/or period of time - unless Bitsquare already does this. There was only one offer I was interested in taking, so I haven't tried multiple simultaneous trades!
EDIT: Turns out it doesn't have a reputation system, as per [comment](
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:55:46
First of all, in-country bank transfers in the UK are not SEPA; they're BACS, CHAPS, or Faster Payment Service. Second, while customer-initiated chargebacks requested as the result of a payment mistake go through the credit payment recovery process, which requires the recipient to agree to the reversal, this is *not* the case for unauthorised transactions created as a result of criminal fraud.
If a bank account is fraudulently taken over and a BACS, CHAPS, Faster Payment Service, or even a SEPA transaction is made without the account holder's authorisation, the bank will refund the victim and *will* chase the resulting debt with the recipient bank. That means your account gets frozen and thoroughly investigated, and the cash is typically removed and returned to the sending bank under your local "proceeds of crime" legislation. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:37:19
Ah, I didn't realise - the FAQs seem to suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:45:32
Yup! It has a list of possible payment types you'd like to accept, including Faster Payments (which I used), BACS, SEPA, cash deposit, and a bunch of others most of which I think are US-specific. *However*, if you're setting up an offer to buy or sell, you need to set up an offer *for each payment type*.
Say, for example, I want to put up an offer to buy one Bitcoin, and I want to pay via Faster Payments, BACS, or cash deposit. That means I'd have to create one offer for each payment type, and would thus be charged three offer-creating-fees instead of one. It also means that if I only want one Bitcoin, I really need to wait for someone to put up an offer to sell instead - 'cos otherwise three separate people could take me up on my offers to buy, and I'm now locked in to buying three Bitcoin instead of one.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:47:05
I sit corrected; I just saw that the person I had traded with now had a (1) by his icon, and figured it was a reputation system.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:46:11
The Bitcoin is already in escrow for the trade in a two-of-three multisig wallet; there's no fiat escrow, though.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:42:22
As far as I can tell, yes: all the offers I've seen accept only one payment method, and when I tried making my own (but not finalising it) I could only choose one.
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:27:02
Go big or go home, right?
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:12:02
£630 to buy one Bitcoin on Coinfloor - that's a hefty whack above market rate. If you're using Coinfloor at the moment, I'd suggest switching to LocalBitCoins or Bitsquare - you could save yourself a fair bit of cash!
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:26:04
This is absolutely the case: buying Bitcoin is a 'safer' experience on Bitsquare than selling it. If you're buying, the only way you can get scammed is by the seller claiming you never paid up; if they do that, the arbitrator gets involved. If you can provide proof you sent the money, the case is closed in your favour and you get the Bitcoins you paid for while the seller loses their security deposit (which goes to the arbitrator as payment for their service.)
As a seller, though, you're always at risk of chargebacks once the transaction is finalised and the Bitcoins have been released to the buyer - unless you use a completely chargeback-free payment method like cash deposit.
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:04:12
That *was* my test transaction!
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:20:53
It's a real risk. For all I know, my trade partner has phished someone's bank account details and has used me to convert a chunk of the account into Bitcoin and sailed off into the sunset; as soon as the real account holder notices, the bank will claw back the payment and I'm SOL.
That's the main reason behind the 1 Bitcoin trade limit; stealing someone's bank details just to get £620 is pretty unlikely. Unlikely doesn't mean impossible, though, so I'll be on tenterhooks until a reasonable time period has passed!
Naturally, if you're *buying* Bitcoins the whole thing is a lot less scary: once the Bitcoins have been released to you, there's nothing the seller can do to get them back again.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:21:51
Key points from the release, which is effectively just a variant of the story that appeared on Bitcoin.com the other day:
Bitcoin Core is big banks, apparently: "This is where the financial establishment saw their chance to try to disrupt and derail this new upstart threatening their control. A group calling themselves 'Bitcoin Core' began to insist, counter-intuitively, that Bitcoin was incapable of scaling to more than 250,000 transactions a day. As a result they started to chip away at the very things that made Bitcoin attractive in the first place. Transaction fees went up and speed of transactions went down. Perfect for the big banks, right?"
Bitcoin.com and CoinGeek.com (plus any and all other Calvin Ayre Media properties) rebrand Bitcoin to Segwit Core: "Hence going forward Bitcoin.com and CoinGeek.com will refer to this groups as 'Segwit Core' and would encourage other Bitcoin media to do the same."
Never mind big blocks, let's go for MASSIVE BLOCKs. "Peter Rizun, Chief Scientist at a company called Bitcoin Unlimited has recently mined and propagated the first ever 1 gigabyte block, meaning the Bitcoin network can scale on a level even better than the likes of Visa. (i.e 10,000 transactions per second, Visa is around 3,000 per second)."
Still using the incorrect BCC nomenclature, and going a step further by quietly dropping the "Cash" to convince people that BCH is Bitcoin proper: "The Calvin Ayre Media Group (which includes CoinGeek.com) intends to work with Roger Ver and his Bitcoin.com group to educate the world on why the Bitcoin public block chain (BCC) is the only one that can do it all."
