@_date: 2017-12-10 11:31:12
Most definitely.
Yes, most bitcoin is already changing hands off-chain and it has been that way since exchanges became a thing.
There will always be this kind of caching of value, the question is how we build it in a trustless way, with minimal third-party reliance. LN is one such technology, tabs naturally emerge in all economies, as do subscriptions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:39:33
Forgive me I'm European, we don't have soccer moms or credit scores. We have football and identity numbers.
But what you guys are claiming is that the latest XBT runup is basically some kind of credit card scam? And now everyone involved gotta sell because an American bank has found out about it?
And your source is Facebook friends? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:34:49
Thanks. Great stuff and it's kinda sad that people downvote opinions. You are being a bit hard on it I think, the fact that this works using the trustless Bitcoin is really great because it enables another way to scale :) far from the only optimization that's needed though.
Interesting, and I'm sure money will tend to pool just as in other financial systems and present capitalism in general, rich getting richer and so on. Whole other debate.
Time will tell and I'm sure LN is a bit oversold in the community, however I'd like to see the centralizing effects as two different axis instead of one.
* The Bitcoin node centralization effect is dependent on block propagation and verification speed.
* The Lightning Network node centralization effect is dependent on fee and capacity between several routes.
IMO the decentralization effect on these two are additive, not a zero-sum game, meaning that if you scale one it does not hamper the other, they add up to a greater total.
Couldn't at least some of the centralization effects of the network be mitigated by the fact that nodes have to rebalance their channels? Money rarely moves back and forth between two economic actors. Money has to move in some kinda graph with a few cycles here and there.
I get where you're coming from, but we will see in a year or two!

Bitcoin Core is a software implementation for one of the Bitcoin full nodes, it follows the Bitcoin consensus rules. Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency and p2p network with the BTC or XBT ticker symbol.
Bitcoin ABC is a software implementation for one of the BCash full nodes, it follows the BCash consensus rules. BCash is the cryptocurrency and p2p network with the BCH or BCC ticker symbols. BCash is also known as 'Bitcoin Cash'.
I hope I got that correct :)

Besides bitcoin being trustless as you said, traditional banking doesn't use

Full nodes (like Bitcoin Core) verify transactions, so a person running a full node can be sure they have been payed, they can also send transactions.
SPV nodes (like Samourai) can send transactions and rely on other peoples full nodes to verify payments.
You can mine and transact using both full nodes and SPV nodes, but the full node has more security, especially when mining since you can verify every part of the previous block. Otherwise you risk mining on a faulty block and your proof of work is wasted!
For just the purpose of sending money SPV nodes are as good as full nodes :)

Most of the disadvantages, none of the advantages of increasing capacity (NOT scaling!).

Most currencies in the west are digital debt, de facto mined by banks by guaranteeing cash flow from the lender.
The government print some paper currency, but it's really not large amounts of money minted in this way.
My point is, the whole govt paper vs geek crypto doesn't tell the whole story. It even tells the wrong story. :)
Money had different properties like, centralized, decentralized, digital analog, debt, inflation, deflation, security (paper quality, hashing function), fungibility. And some of these overlap and change throughout time. Some like fungibility depends on a lot of external factors. Let's not be flatlanders about this.

@_date: 2014-05-30 06:25:42
First of all let me say that I agree with you and thanks for your input. 
There is weak customer demand for crypto currency yet, the user experience has not reached its full potential, multi signature wallets are not the norm yet (cmon blockchain.info!). All this means that bitcoin is harder to use, less safe because of user fuckups.
Everyone with half a brain recognize this, but brain power is a scarce resource on this subreddit. :-) The last two talks by Gavin and Hearn mention these issues.
Having said that.. the possibilities are almost endless, so let's develop multi sig wallets, dark wallets, awesome user experience, open source hardware wallets, marketplaces, blockchain notaries, the general community, services and digital products and go TO TEH MOOOOOOOOOOON with this rocket while we're at it. 
Now everyone must give me an upvote.

I meant just basic functionality like a computer program sending money to someone, it's like one API call to send money to anyone in the world. No need to hook up both parties in the various legal realms of meatspace. Just send that money!
No one can stop that one transaction as it happens, you can hunt it down later on but the transaction itself is frictionless. I have a hunch that this has value, utility or whatever we call it.
I don't care about causality within current demographic, people will try crazy shit and if bitcoin is useful it will prosper within that niche.

4:th money laundering directive of EU says cash transactions above 1500 EUR are prohibited. Governments are free to lower that limit, like Sweden has done with its 500 EUR limit.
I dunno specifics about the UK, but it doesn't matter, these regulations are coming worldwide and people better be ready, especially bitcoin folks with a few million EUR unrealized profits.
This might be an unpopular opinion, but my advice to new people is, keep receipts (this sounds ridiculous for us who bought before 2013), never buy with cash and have everything ready when the taxman comes or when the banks freeze your assets.
And don't daytrade, it might lead to 300% taxes, which means you're broke with debt.

Seems like a very healthy way of handling the fee pressure and reducing the UTXO set, benefits everyone using the blockchain!
Do you just take the current transactions bitcoin volume (amount) and iterate it over each possible UTXO, or do you gather, say... 30 transactions and try to get that whole batch as cheap as possible? Perhaps you could even RBF them while awaiting the next block, sounds messy though :)

@_date: 2017-08-28 06:12:57
Thanks, I'll gladly join you in the discussion. Some quick thoughts, I'm on my way to work. :D
The first thing that comes to my mind is that I reject the notion that miners have ultimate power. Miners, users, exchanges, regulators and developers, all have part in governing Bitcoin, this might not be ideal but it's a fact imo.
The second thing that comes to my mind, is the fact that consensus systems are hard to change, this is by design.
About the theory that LN hubs will be a centralizing force, well, they are centralized in themselves yes. But the alternative is centralization around miners ONLY. So, the effect is additive, yes LN will centralize around hubs (most likely), and hubs might be able to analyze transactions, but! Compare this to embedding every transaction on the block-chain, at least the 2nd layer-way increases the forward-secrecy property.
Besides, the reality today, is that a lot of second layer transactions take place, only they update a SQL db, LN are actual Bitcoin transactions, so it is not worse than what we have today (although we should always strive to be better than status quo).
Regarding the fact that miners should have part in second layer economy, THEY DO, with LN. They get payed to open and close channels, compare to present situation where the SQL query does NOT credit the poor miners.
Patents, everyone should work with EFF and declare them defensive, and we should collectively decide what this actually means! Bitmain should also cooperate with EFF and include ASICBoost. This seems like a pretty good first step, I'm not a lawyer and hate SW patents like the rest of us.
Sorry this is all I have time for now, additional braindump: fuck New York agreement! The contentious fork debate should be over and done with, with Bitcoin Cash. NYA is off since the miners flip-flop.
Let's look forward, if we are going to hardfork, let's do it better. btc1 client is a joke, no peer review, no commits in a month, does not adhere to open source process.

Everyone don't need to run pruning nodes, but a few participants do. You create pruning nodes from archive nodes, this is known as syncing and happens when you first start the node.
It has the genesis block from 2009 and downloads consecutive blocks, block by block until it reaches the present. The result of this is every adress' "balance".

There is nothing stopping nodes from forwarding a RBF transaction, but all nodes might not forward it.
There's an old saying that \*information wants to be free\*, this is especially true in a P2P gossip network. It's gossip and node policy "all the way down", before it gets recorded in a block.
There is nothing nodes can do to stop me from double\-spending an unconfirmed transaction. Any mining pool would be incentivized to pick up the double\-spend tx, since it pays them more.

SPV wallets are not peer-to-peer, they are client-server. LN (Lightning Network) and full nodes are peer to peer.
LN and SegWit are different things, SegWit is a bug fix for tx malleability. You can make LN without having SegWit, you can actually make whatever you want as a second layer. Even "Bitcoin Cash" can have LN, who's gonna stop people running peer-to-peer software? Not you, not me.
Yes, ofc it's easier to run p2p second layer protocols when you fix tx malleability bugs. I do agree this is more political, everyone who knows a bit or two about the protocol agrees that fixing tx malleability is needed, the rest of the debate are people talking about Satoshis Vision and AXA Bilderberg Blorgstream, stupid dorks.

That's only because of the annoying anti-smokers being such fucking tards, they drag the larger group of non-smokers down the lame-hole.

Do you think Bitcoin can be censored and its money base devalued?
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:25:07
Yeah, I meant the inflation rate and \~21M BTC max issuance from mining coinbase rewards.
I actually do think Bitcoin can be censored in various ways and I also believe that the inflation rate could be raised, I'm not saying the risk is big, just that it's possible because.. anything is possible!
Bribing attacks or compromised mining pools could wreck havoc, but the incentive structure in PoW and Bitcoin appear very tight and solid, but I'm no game theorist.
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:55:42
Bitcoin might very well be overvalued, I'm always wrong so I wont try to predict the future.
However, I cannot really connect the dots in your argument.
Either the companies (dotcom) didn't make profit, mining prospects were wrong, or it came as a result of increased credit expansion followed by debt trap. And in the case of mining prospects the supply side greatly increased.
Bitcoin has been through, and perhaps is going through, a pretty large bubble. But on all the above points, that is really not an issue.
Bitcoin still works, supply is limited and looks to stay that way. It is not a company, but a protocol and form of money.
The thing is, I see bubbles everywhere now, in the stock markets, real estate (lol China), all largely fueled by credit expansion. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:03:37
Security of the transaction increases with hashing power over time.
How many confirmations you choose to wait is up to the transacting parties.
You can fork for more frequent blocks, many altcoins have that. But in the basic sense it does not decrease transaction time. One confirmation in super-frequent blocks is worth less than one with longer periods.
History can always be rewritten in blockchains, it just gets more and more expensive to do so the ~~more blocks~~ hashing-power-put-into-the-blockchain you have to rewrite.
The issue is more about propagation time, which is based on the speed of light and the area surface of planet earth. :)

IOTA isn't trustless enough to be called a cryptocurrency IMO.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:59:50
Very small I would suppose, and you guys are correct in that sense, but if the incentives are there (\*I can make money off of this\*), my arguing is that it will be used.
I care about the future potential numbers.
Generally in information theory it is a well known understanding that information is easier to have\-spread than to contain. I hope you see my point. But yeah, I would love to see numbers or even case studies of double\-spends! I know of few cases if any clear\-cut examples.
@_date: 2019-08-23 09:24:22


It was meant as both. Or rather, it was obvious and clearly communicated that this thing might make you rich.
Bitcoin is still pseudonymous and has no chargebacks and I agree that BCH and Bitcoin work kinda the same. But they are different blockchains obviously.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:00:10
SegWit does double the blocksize, fixes the quadratic hashing problem and facilitates second-layer networks AND is well tested, has developer, business and user consensus, has been ready for over a year. 
Seems like the obvious first step don't you think?
It has been blocked because certain people want another solution FIRST. The real reason is that they want control and have had their egos hurt, is what I think.
Now we have moved on and they have their own alt-coin, I hope it survives well enough, so we never ever will have this argument again. This shit has to stop NOW!

@_date: 2018-06-07 11:47:21
RBF is just a node policy.
In any case there is no need for a collusion relationship with a miner, since the double\-spend transactions pays the miner more.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:03:35
PoW mining is the only way to secure a blockchain and avoid centralization.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:59:07
Dude, get help or something.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:26:26
I was just arguing that RBF is a node policy and double spends are possible depending on what transactions the miner (pool) chooses to finally include in the block.
I will not label the miners short\-term profit maximization strategies as collusion, it is simply a result of the incentive structure.

You cannot compare value throughout time, because things that you can buy for it varies in value as well.

Kraken OTC or regular online order. Get verified as highest tier and you are pretty much golden. You can deposit or withdraw 10 million dollars.
I would also consider XBT Provider through Avanza, Nordnet or such ISK account. You wouldn't be holding actual bitcoin yourself, but you have that sweet ISK schablonskatt and zero paperwork.
I would do both, it is very hard to cash out to Swedish banks, if you move large sums of fiat money to a bank account, they may flag it as terrorist money or whatever lame excuse. This is not a problem with the XBT certificate.
Other ways: Bitstamp (very good and liquid market), Safello (pricey but quick with BankID), BTCX (pricey but quick with BankID), I think even Coinbase works.

You are talking about the Bitcoin standard (in relation to the gold standard), but in terms of SI units.
SI units can be derived by comparison and measurement with other physical phenomena, value cannot, because the things you compare it with change and become irrelevant.

It does not slow down LN adoption, how is your reasoning?
Segwit is optional to implement and support, and as you said, it is also optional to use these services! Bring it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:30:04
Yeah, agreed!
But I'd say paper money is far better, because at least private banks cannot print it, as with digital fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:04:33
Yes, that part of your argument is correct, BTC became overvalued in terms of some property and people rushed to get in, so it eventually crashed causing a chain-reaction which we are still inside.
Same as every BTC bubble, I've been through most.

I'm guessing you wouldn't know what to do with them :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:01:16
When you make a loss it is deductable by 70&amp; if you trade BTC -&gt; LTC you actually sell BTC and buy LTC for the SEK value of the LTC, you are taxed on the BTC profit 30&amp; or you can deduct it by 70&amp;
Then you trade LTC -&gt; XMR and the profit/loss of the LTC -&gt; SEK-value of XMR priced in LTC converted to SEK.

AFAIK AMP actually increases payments, but stuckless payments, while it does sound very effective, do they have any privacy vulnerabilities?

Yes, even in peace times the police steal assets of suspects. This is true in North America and large parts of Europe, it is also related to money laundering. The burden of proof is on the suspect in money laundering cases.

He's not saying he wants SegWit, he's saying that SegWit is not needed to build second layer solutions on BCash.
But with without the transaction malleabilty bugfix that is SegWit, it is harder.

SegWit is first and foremost a malleability bugfix which could be deployed as a soft-fork.
I don't know about flextrans, it seems good, but you have to remember there is very little development and code review coming out of the BCash space, lots of secrecy. So there simply is not enough analysis, their previous released code has been riddled with bugs though.
And I don't know if I trust extensible protocols in my transactions, it adds risk, just look at Ethereum for an extreme example.

The Blockchain will keep ticking. It is very hard to attack and this seems to create incentives to invest even more into it.


The Blockchain has been ticking.


Not by itself no, but you have to improve scalability in all ways possible, it will never be solved.


Yes, we should increase it until we hit full capacity. And we should look into ways of growing it in a safe way.


Roll out Confidential Transactions, Lightning Network, Dandelion, aggregated signatures.


118 looks good 
116 and 117 is about MAST support, quite interesting.


Great company, they are working on improving fungibility and privacy for cryptocurrencies!


Not sure if it is. I think this will improve along with lifespan of miners.

How can we achieve full node incentivisation that is not vulnerable to sybill attacks?
How can we ensure that a node is not pruned? Sounds complicated and is probably susceptible to cheating.
Lightning network is probably very much like other things in nature, it is characterized by path-of-least-resistance. This always brings centralization pressure in IT systems, however, it also relieves the block-chain, making it more effective. The small blockchain is harder to regulate, the larger blockchain is easier to regulate.
LN is in no way unnecessary. In fact, it is kinda impossible to prevent additional layers on-top of a protocol. LN can even run without the SegWit bugfix.


With a large blocksize, we won't have many nodes at all. SPV does not count.
LN, mining pools, users, developers can all be censored. P2P networks like LN is harder to censor, SPV nodes are easily lied to because they cannot verify.
Everything has centralization properties because nature, look at the bigger picture though, we need to scale in several ways. The system *will* scale in many many ways, not just by blindly increasing the blocksize.

To me Bitcoin is all about tradeoffs, optimizations and game theory. We should direct all our energy into making these work as good as possible. Let's talk about ideas instead of people kinda thing.
For instance, I've seen a few times people who say block size increases (outside of segwit) is not an allowed subject to talk about here. I think that's wrong, but you have to bring something new to the table, or it will be flagged as trolling which simplistic arguments effectively are.

There might be a reason to raise it, but it is a very bad solution for scalability.
A good analogy is that, it's like having the whole world on the same Wifi, instead of switching the network.
However, additional throughput increases are sure to be needed in the future, there just isn't any way to reach consensus for a hardfork right now.

We are comparing two different ways of increasing throughput, it depends on the type of transaction and LN enables new types of transactions (microtransactions). But LN can scale to millions transactions per second, most likely small ones since it is limited by volume liquidity, on-chain transactions are limited by size (data), data that has to be processed by each node in the network, not just nodes participating in the route.


I have not seen anything hinting at this, please lay out the argument as to why.


LN will be able to scale, but it has different tradeoffs and features, such as being volume-bound instead of size-bound.
It helps decentralization in the way that it keeps the hardware requirements light for running a node. There will be more value flowing through highly capitalized payment channels, since the edges in the route are limited by liquidity of channels (BTC volume). However, entry is permissionless.
As for security, LN nodes are hot wallets and are less secure than a passive on-chain address.


They are trade-offs but from my point of view having these options are essential for any scalability to take place. And you know what? There is nothing stopping the lightning network for running on top of any blockchain really, since the base layer is permissionless you can even run (a overly complicated version of) the lightning network on the BCH blockchain.
Like with most things it doesn't matter what you or I think.


Security risks are:
* Hot wallet can be hacked since it's not airgapped
* False positive LN penalty (eltoo is a proposed solution to this)


To be decided by each node and/or by market forces, as with any chaotic system we have no clue what the ideal number or opening speed is!
But check out channel rebalancing techniques, you might not have to close a channel.


There is a simple gossip protocol described in BOLT 7, so I suggest you start your research there.
Just like with the internet each participant in the network is free to peer with anyone, each node is incentivized to broadcast their balances and play along to receive parts of the routing fee (difference to the internet where the incentives are all external).

Wouldn't bitcoin be more easily auditable? Simple case could be a set of hierarchically deterministic public keys on the actual blockchain, built in *warrant canary* right there! Compare that to going down in the vault.

No, if they did it that way, I would just have to trust the Bitcoin blockchain or proof-of-reserves cryptographic techniques.
If they have the bitcoin reserves backing their paper BTC, this will not be a problem since the process can be automated and doesn't require guards, vault access, false identities, rental cars, third parties, govt/military clearance and a swarm of lawyers. As I imagine gold auditing does.

This is a very interesting perspective and they are not alone in monitoring these things.
I think this misses a big point, the flow of capital and capital controls. Bitcoin is borderless, energy is global, Bitcoin turns energy into tokens, to be freely moved across borders.
Lots of actors don't care about a futures market in Chicago, I don't care, the folks in here hardly care. They care about the real deal, they accumulate.
As they do that, the asset becomes more scarce. Futures influence the price, yes. But it doesn't change the fundamental process of turning bad money into energy and then into better money. Worldwide my moon baby.

It is a good question IMO and one I've been forced to think hard about the last couple of years.
In a deal between two (or more) parties, any form of payment or, as in this case a promise of a on-chain payment, is possible.
However, there is infinite demand for cheap blockspace and infinite demand for cheap transactions, there are obvious incentives to pay as little as possible for a transaction. So far so good?
Well, what happens when blocks fill up, due to the ever increasing demand for blockspace? Transactions get more pricey, so that 0-conf might never get included in a block! The distance between 0:th and 1:st conf is larger than the one between 1:st and 2:nd.
There is however one problem with the incentives in accepting 0-conf, it puts a lot of trust in the mining pools, mining pools which could take part in the fraud. The bribe itself is even built-in, it is the transaction fee, which could be increased on the double-spend.
This type of bribe has always been possible, even before we reintroduced replace-by-fee node policy. Is the risk worth it? I'm not the one to decide, it has to be up to the recipient of the transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:11:49

Guys, you might have it backwards regarding value based. Value based is decentralized and peer to peer in the sense that it doesn't even require an internet connection.
Riksbanken suggests a hybrid system, probably to prevent bank-runs or unlawful transactions, but still ensure small transactions during national or local emergencies.
Some suggestions are quite interesting, I'd like to hear from more people about this and I'd be glad to discuss this on IRC or elsewhere.

Perhaps people wont like the UX of opening up a seperate application (a LN wallet in this case), so it could very well be up to *if we can present it in a frictionless way*.
But then again, perhaps you can just skip the blockchain if you are building a service around it! That is always a concern.

An address with bitcoin in it might still 'be used' to hodl, it is "passively" in lack of a better word, in use for that particular case. And this is just for off-exchange storage.

So the PoW should be 3D rendering? Because I don't believe that the needs for 3D rendering and PoW GPU mining will stay the same, there will always be one more tweak you can make.
Besides, why would you want to use GPU, since they are so hard to make? It's better to have a simple algo that anyone can build an ASIC for themselves.

It can be a part of tumbling, in order to transfer through an alt, you have to make atleast 2 transactions to the exchange address, this is for the Bitcoin blockchain. When I say off-chain, I mean off the Bitcoin chain.
Still, even if we consider alt-chains. Some of them have privacy features, such as the CT of Monero, or zkproofs of Zcash, that can happen on-chain and still attract privacy features, correct me if I'm wrong.
Have a nice day.

I doubt it, as you also were hinting at, although it is a significant (theoretical) risk as a result of miner centralization.
Yeah probably it is real usage, but sure, miners have every incentive to increase the amount of bitcoin per block, in whatever way. Their macro-incentives relies on the success on bitcoin, but that's not really how we do game theory.
To elaborate, in order to fill blocks with crap transactions, it costs a certain amount. The colluding miners would have to trust each other well enough, because it would either be detectable by blockchain analysis and verifiable by the cartel. Or in the case of a gentlemens agreement without traceable stake, be vulnerable to cheating among colluding parts.
Feel free to point out flaws in my reasoning.

Bitcoins mission was not free transactions, the mission was that as the block reward decreases, the total amount of fees increase.
That's how you keep it deflationary with the right incentives. Now you can increase the block size, but they you have a decentralization problem.
What happens to centralized currencies? They inflate and lose fungibility.
You might think of this as a nice clear path, but it's not. Blockchains are more inefficient than people think.

So it's easier to rob a person in the streets, but you have to work hard every time and the risk is higher. The potential payout is greater in stealing bitcoin and you don't risk getting beat up, filmed or shot if you do it right.
Besides, I think people are morally more likely to steal digital cash than having to look the person in the eye and mug them.

I've really come to appreciate r/bitcoins mobilization in regards to green coins and attacks on fungibility and exposing all this, but do we really have to focus on personalities and individuals?
Bad seeds will come and go, let's focus on building corruption-free democratic systems, that gets the incentives right.
Individuals can always be compromised, the protocol has to ensure that it's not profitable, or else this thing will never work as intended. So let's not think this "IRL blacklisting" will be enough. And yeah.. meta-incentives doesn't really work!
Let's get started on decentralizing and distributing bitcoin again. Work on Coinjoin, Zerocoin, 2.0, mixing or whatever it's called. We need to stay one step ahead, we need to do it right.
TL;dr: supervillains are overrated.

Sure, but bitcoin is deflationary in the sense that its value is supposed to increase and fewer and fewer are made every block.
What the central banks target does not apply to Bitcoin, they target based on CPI and similar tools, which is a peg to an ever changing shopping basket :) You cannot peg a trustless distributed permissionless cryptocurrency to a real-world object in a nice way yet.
Fiat money is not only created by central banks, but also by regular banks, every time there is debt creation. Money supply is divided into different categories (M1, M2 and M3).
There are different opinions on deflation and inflation, most favor inflation, but it does not really apply to bitcoin. Bitcoin is deflationary so arguing about this is pointless.

[Embrace, extend and extinguish]( is the conspiracy I'm talking about, it could be in the form of Bitcoins [green addresses]( or web wallets.
I'm not criticizing Ripple, I think it's brilliant in many ways. Not in a groundbreaking kind of way, but in an Instagram or Dropbox kind of way. A simple idea you stick with, market and own to a 100%.
But look around yourself, the web is more and more centralized. Email started out decentralized or *federated*, but now everyone is on a few providers like Gmail etc. People used to have their own homepages, now they use Facebook.
Systems that are distributed is key, all others will eventually end up centralized. Bitcoin probably will to, I have a feeling it's growing way to fast. Ripple probably will.

Proof of Stake requires subjectivity in what to trust, I fail to see how it cannot be gamed (requiring a hardfork like eth/etc).

Just regular news, it's been all over the place lately.
This is a good start  follow the citations, my friend. I'm not saying Bitcoin might be used by *large scale* drug smugglers in the future, but that's not really the case right now.
Do you have any juicy sources to back your claims?
@_date: 2013-12-31 12:51:29
Or maybe the *well known* info that previous attempts at non-government money were squashed before it became established. Like e-gold, that currency in China, all the geographically local LETS currencies etc.
If the idea is sound, the incentive structure correct, bitcoin would still thrive and find its niche in the end. The crypto community has been moving slow and has had their dreams crushed, like the dream of everyone using PGP ending up in a big *meh*. Like initial reactions to the mailinglist announcement shows.
I really don't care what Satoshi thinks, but people will continue try to fit Bitcoin into their world view. I happen agree with OP, not that it matters what I think! :)

I'm not ignoring any of said possibilities, I'm just saying they are still more of possibilities than reality.
It doesn't really matter what deep profound thoughts you come up with, the Bitcoin network is cheaper to attack than mining precious metals on an asteroid. Well within the range of several nation states defense budgets.

not quite sure I follow you, but the next hash is based on the current one, which is based on the previous one. all the way back to genesis.
so it would seem like all successful hashes within a difficulty range are equally hard.

you will also lose bitcoin if you hand out the private key, but that has higher entropy than what 3 decimal digits will provide :)

I use 5 ordinary dice.
I use [diceware]( which maps a roll of 5 dice to an english word.
It generates 12.9 bits of entropy per english word.
Then I boot a live GNU/Linux distro and transfer an audited version of [bitaddress]( to it.
I make sure the Linux distro is offline (apart from the USB stick, which is a kind of network connection).
I open the bitaddress HTML file and click the brainwallet tab.
Enter my dice-generated words.
Now I have a bitcoin address and private key.
Weaknesses: The USB transfer of the bitaddress page can be attacked. If the computer isn't used a lot, the memory can still have information about the private key.

Bitcoin wallet balance is the result of previous transactions.
Transactions are confirmed almost every time a block is mined. Every confirmation (block mined) verifies it a bit more.
After one verification you're kinda sure, after two you're pretty sure, after three you're pretty damn sure ass hell sure, etc.
Every verification is embedded into the blockchain. Your transactions' verifications are the amount of blocks mined that confirm your transaction.
Every mined block verifies every previous mined block of the blockchain using mathematical magic called cryptography.

I know you didn't reply to me, but all I said is that it *contributed*. Of course there were more or less serious investors like myself and even businesses during that time driving up price.
But people are sheepish, so as far as I know exaggerations like that Cyprus thing is going to drive up price a lot.
Point is, we'll never know exactly what went through the minds of every individual who has driven the price up to currnent levels. I'm guessing media hype has a lot to do with that frothy bubbly action we all love to hate! :)
