@_date: 2015-06-06 16:04:28
Well They are apparently not transferring their assests into bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:18:35
correct me if I'm wrong. When the banks handle all these 1000s transactions per second the transaction is by all means not complete. Most of the time it takes days for the funds to reach the destination. Bitcoin might be slower but when someone signs a transaction the funds have already arrived at the destination albeit not confirmed yet by being solved in a block.
So banks initiate huge amounts of transaction per second but they do not complete them for long periods.
@_date: 2015-06-21 17:52:10

What people fail to realize(or know) is that somewhere in the 1950s the huge German debt. to UK,USA, and other nations forgave Germany. Half of germanies debt. was forgiven ( don't ever have to pay back) the other half was negotiated of a 30 year period. And now Gemany is denying Greece the exact same forgivness that they got.

I thought that was obvious to everyone??? your comment doesn't ad anything to my post.
The point is banking transactions with a huge delay and instant bitcoin  transactions is like comparing apples and oranges. The moment the bitcoin network can handle anything close to the banks, it'll already be far superior.

I wasn't aware of all these IP limits/problems on countries. This is a very good point. You provided me with the best answer. thank you! Do you know if IPv6 will solved this? I guess the only solution is a unique private ID (one per person) right? but how hhmmm.... I have the solution..

You obviously don't understand what I mean.
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:08:46
As for the random part:  You can use a seed (such as the time and amount of a previous transaction) which can be verified on the block chain. Every miner can then submit their random number (in this case 1-3) as they are mining. That's one idea, getting a random number in the bitcoin protocol is the least of our worries.
from: 
When a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. 
So then with some programming changes, the network will agree which were 3 fastest miners. and randomly choose who is the real winner.    and... which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:26:38
but would prevent the %51 attack. its an easy solution. It doesn't cost more energy then right now because the difficult level will go down.
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:29:34
A server at a pool broadcasts a block solution correct?(not the 100's or 1000's of miners mining in that pool)  all the miners in the pool contribute to finding a solution? so in a sense based on this chart,   its like there are only 15 or so miners mining(actuall miners broadcasting the solution) on the bitcoin network. So the power of the bitcoin network is not really distributed to all the 1000's of miners around the world mining (they way it was indented ) am i correct?
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:57:44
proof of stake isnt good either because the rich will get even richer.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:01:33
this is not a real solution. Its just a band-aid over the symptom.  My proposal solves the problem giving more value to the network, and as a programmer it is not complicated and easily do-able.
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:59:10
The protocol decides, its random, one of the top 3 or 5 or 10(what ever) fastest miners who solve the block. The difficulty will actually go down.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:25:56
Ok, I just wanted to confirm that the pools behave like solo miners on the network. and its confirmed. thanks. So in reality, despite the corrections that can be made, It's like 15 solo miners run the bitcoin network, wow, not good.
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:55:24
exactly.everyone who has internet access( at least one ip address needed) can participate even with an older laptop. I think its way more fair and environmentally friendly. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:32:28
 I guess the only solution is a unique private ID (one per person) . i'm working on it, will post!
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:03:08
"how is the winner randomly chosen? The miners run the protocol, what is to stop them from manipulating the 'random' output?"  
You can use a seed (such as the time and amount of a previous transaction) which can be verified on the block chain. Every miner can then submit their random number (in this case 1-3) as they are mining. That's one idea, come on getting a random number in the bitcoin protocol is the least of our worries.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:46:34
I think for the moment PoPN would be the best option. (proof of phone number) it would be much more expensive and harder to maintain many phone accounts compared to buying and mainlining IP addresses. Also most third world countries have abundant supply of phone numbers but very limited IP addresses. Too bad satoshi didn't choose this option. How ever PoUH (proof of unique human) is the ultimate.
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:01:15
there is a finite list of IPs, the protocol will will handle this easily.
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:51:34
- the race for the top 3 is always grouped to one block. So its for miners working on the SAME block. so its always the top 3 miners that solve the same block. so there will never be a fork.
- i agree, the second part of my idea can't really work.
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:57:06
making it more fair... more available to the masses 
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:34:14
The protocol change will not notify who solved it first. It would notify once the random winner is picked(one of the top 3). It is not an expensive change. you said: "people would be working towards nothingness, and then likely not be rewarded even though they solved something first." Well don't you want to remove the most vulnerable part of Bitcoin giving it even more value???
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:00:12
I will argue, although cheaper, it is harder to generate more ip addresses than hashing power.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:00:40
they wont know that they are the first to solve.
@_date: 2014-05-12 01:01:36


@_date: 2014-07-03 19:04:18
You forgot about the 2nd part of my solution: a miner can never win a block again until 3 more blocks get solved by other miners first. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:34:14
All you need to tell them is that when going through a payment processor such as bitpay, the moment you send them bitcoin they get their precious fiat money instantly, no work required on their end. You give them tulips, they get cash. I have convinced many places once they know about this. This gets them excited and they eventually hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-12 00:59:03
in the future, if it was random based, everyone with an internet connection can participate, so this means the whole world.

Send me your address so I can mail you the plane tickets.
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:56:24
So technically the bitcoin network is not distributed over 1000's of miners (the decision makers ) that means a 51% attack it resting on about 15-20 pools. So if ghash.io wants to make a %51 attack and you are in that pool, you are contributing to the attack, you can't be in the pool mining and not participate in an attack. this is not good.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:29:58
More important is what the mining pools will accept.

When a block is solved, the bitcoin protocol behaves as if nothing got solved. It just logs who solved it 1st. Then another miner will solve it, also saving the info. Then a 3rd miner. At this point it is randomly awarded to one of the three.

I should have clarified. I true decentralized bitcoin/fiat cannot exist from the comfort of your room without leaving the house. But there are some real good comments in this thread and my favorite ones are if the BTMs participate in the exchange. So you would load your exchage account with fiat through a BTM. And if someone on the other side of the world buys your order he simply withdraws the cash out from his local BTM. However, this still requires footwork and i'm assuming rigorous efferts to keep the BTM always full of cash, which could lead to other problems.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:24:05


BWaahhhahahahahahaaaaa!!!  good one! Capitalism has no rules. 90%+ of people would trade their morals for wealth any day.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:55:02
On further deliberation a decentralized exchange with BTM's is not a viable option because a malicious owner of a BTM can compromise it. An as such make it seem as if real fiat money is being deposited. So I guess you can throw this idea right out the window.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:52:20

how about this? an authority declares arbitrarily  (like they often due) that you are holding bitcoins illegally, they sanction you and say anyone accepting bitcoin from this person is illegal, blah blah blah....  now those coins are tainted???? see what i mean? they don't even have to be stolen coins,  we need to keep the coins as fungible as possible. we cant reject any coins.

I don't get it? Yanis is a self proclaimed Marxist yet he constantly makes the argument that bitcoin will destroy our current capitalism system.(i agree with that)

@_date: 2015-02-20 20:37:51
From what I understand it's a protocol.
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:06:20
Yanis argument in layman's term: Lets says the whole world works only with bitcoin and an arbitrary country gets pummeled by some kind of natural disaster. If that country does not have the funds (from taxes) for disaster relief than they are basically screwed. There are endless other examples where a country would need money quickly ( 2008 US banks going tits up...) to help out some kind of emergency. These conditions only happen in a capitalistic system. Since you cannot 'print' more bitcoins at will, capitalism itself would collapse. And before you think capitalism is the ultimate of mans achievement I urge you to watch this very short video.
