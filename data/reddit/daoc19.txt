im pretty sure u can claim your computer and gpu's as expense if you have mined any coins since your self employed

so basically bitcoin needs to add a clause saying the same thing wow does and this whole issue of taxing it wouldnt be an issue? because there is no exchange built into bitcoin as well

@_date: 2014-04-13 13:30:10

right so really its just a mirage.. so they are what they thought they were and you let em off the hook

this new irs rule is on "mined" coined is taxed at the dollar amount it was mined as well as sold coin. my point was that you are mining it when you play farming gold
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:07:46
price is now closer to what the coin is worth
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:11:13
it does if you have 1m gold coins you can sell them for usd on an exchange that is what a virtual currency is.. however as the previous person stated its a closed system so due to the irs rules its not applicable to tax laws atm.

it looks like coinbase will be the "paypal" of bitcoin for us in the next few years.. one of the employees is actually the creator of litecoin so i would guess ltc would be available in the near future as well
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:28:44
thats why im saying the rule doesent work .. it should be when you sell your crypto to usd at that time its taxed not durring mining
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:23:12
the poeple making "minining" ped's should be paying tax as well then? since they could be traded for usd
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:18:23
you can just trade your btc for usd when it drops why woulndt you have some in a exchange for that purpose alone
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:44:34
alright thanks for the info... 
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:28:08
in this example the irs taxes you when "MINING" as income.. this would make "farming" in wow a taxable income. Its a virtual currency thats traded on a market so at the time of farming it should be taxed accordingly.

In its answer to Question 8, the notice states that someone who “mines” virtual currency has income when they receive the virtual currency.  I have to admit that I have read about mining as it relates to bitcoins and still do not grasp it.  In principle, though, if the “mining” is creating virtual currency that did not previously exist and the virtual currency is property, there should not be gross income until the currency is exchanged for something.  It will be interesting if that issue ever gets litigated.
