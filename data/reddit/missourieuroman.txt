You CAN send without fee just fine, it just takes a long time for confirmation. The fee is also negligible compared to any other means of monetary transfer.

"A few facts". Well you are off to a good start being 100% wrong on 2 out of 3 statements. Congrats!
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:42:18
Bitcointalk is dying, no reason to even visit anymore. 100% trolls, scams and idiots.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:33:11
Sad part is that this video made by a semi-informed potsmoker explains Bitcoin better than at least half of all newspaper articles and interviews out there. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:17:58
Another fucking Alt-coin scam. Go ahead invest all you want into 'GEEEEMS!" im sure it will be 'the next bitcoin' . . 
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:44:00
Your username has GAW in it, your opinion is worthless.

Everyone is so up in arms about the foundation. If you aren't donating, why care? Start your own damn foundation. Cody is just a pathetic attention whore.
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:34:29
So instead of simply giving millions of dollars to the developers/owners they will have to be 'paid' for 'development'. OK, so just like the Ripple scam. There is still NOTHING in the entire concept that intelligently explains why all the functionality could not have been incorporated using Bitcoin directly (outside of the 'line our pockets' factor of course) and taking on capital from investors like normal fucking companies.
Oh and this: "Contribution scores are calculated for every user in the network, and users with larger gems reservoirs will be rewarded more generously than users without gems."
Pretty much nullifies everything your 'friends' here have said in every answer. Since it most certainly does reward IPO investments.

He's just a pathetic right wing nut. Who cares about that moron?
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:41:21
Yeah, totally! Cause organizing is bad right? Idiot.
@_date: 2014-12-20 22:42:44
Yeah, you can prob wait a while for him to have a plan for anything.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:04:35
The last 2 weeks have been great if you purchased Christmas presents with Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:32:38
Thinly veiled PR for BitUsd crap alt-currency. Too bad.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:52:22
You could search google for their Bitcoin revenue last year but I guess you are too stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:29:52
I will definitely take a look at the pattern. Seems a little odd since volume is higher on Bitfinex but I guess anything is possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:10:52


Yeah, not bitter and whiny at all :)
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:55:18
Meant power cost of $0.03 or 3 cents KW/h
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:44:31
Not hard to guess, but in all seriousness what is an 'official supporter'? 
@_date: 2015-01-22 16:29:25
Yeah, "dead". Learn to read. Come back. Profit.
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:57:14
I for one feel fine. This  just means that everything I got for Christmas when I paid in BTC was a great deal! Buying  back now makes sense to me either way. Use it or lose it people!
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:33:32
It's not 'really' up $70 since low. The $160 low was a single giant dump and can barely be considered a trading floor. I would say $175-$180 was the low, so its up somewhere around $30-$40. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:20:38
Some angry PayCrapcoin bagholder that pissed his pants.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:39:54
$20 Paycpom 'buy back' but only so slowly that it doesn't matter . . Yeah, not a scam at all :)
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:37:21
IHB.io (Ihavebitcoin) is pretty decent. Lots of reposted articles but also well written opinion content etc.
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:02:18
You are never going to get to fuck him if you call him a piece of shit. Just saying. Good luck though!
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:11:49
This is a point, but even assuming rock bottom power prices of say $0.03 cents and a cost of maybe $300 per TH of mining equipment today's price of BTC and difficulty is a gamble. One has got to give soon.
@_date: 2015-03-16 01:31:09
Yeah, they will never go below 10nm.. I wonder why no one else has heard the news that Intel will stop developing micro processors in a few years. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:11:37
And NO, since MPOE (owner of Bitbet) bet heavily against himself when he realized he would lose he just hedged and ruined the odds so that he wouldn't lose. This is why BitBet sucks donkey balls.
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:10:06
And he didnt lose shit. He hedged by betting heavily against his own original bet when resolution came close so he lost maybe a few BTC if that. Hes a scammer and BitBet is a terrible betting site. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:42:34
Yes, just like that. You aren't stupid at all.
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:10:49
Well thank you, i am pretty sure I do know more. You on the other hand seem like just another idiot that doesn't understand Bitcoin or the ecosystem so probably not worth my time.
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:40:23
Seriously, LikeJR needs a shower, a shave and a vacation. That kid is just getting unstable.
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:54:44
Fuelcoin mentioned in supposedly serious article. Yeah, move along folks.
@_date: 2015-02-06 14:04:13
Eastern European country I assume.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:15:45
ERMAGERD BITCOIN DONT SCALE! (takes no part of Moores law into consideration)
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:07:53
Aren't we a witty little child. Here, have a snowcone :)
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:40:57
I bet more than 10% think Scam/rip-off/fraud when they hear 'Banks'. I know I do.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:03:32
Considering their bare bones staff and Micon's already deep pockets this  likely wasn't the cause. I am betting they got out and sold customer database (emails) to Pokerstars or other larger Poker room getting ready to accept BTC before they got marginalized. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:09:33
Use it weekly, seems you think you have to pay with Bitcoin QT from a laptop or some dumb shit.
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:09:04
NO! Jezus, fucking google it first. The owner of the betting site bet and then bet against himself to hedge so he lost maybe a few BTC. Just another bet-scam by MPOE.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:19:37
By morals i mean as in "It's not very moral to lie openly about what someone else said or did, so that you can be an attention whore"
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:17:00
Reason 497 that Cody Wilson is just an attention whore with no morals. Move along, nothing to see here. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:42:09
Not sure you know how Bitcoin works. It would be just as smooth paying with any of several Android Bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:41:02
I have nothing to add..
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:14:07
Maybe because he is a flashy egomaniac. Just maybe.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:27:07
Bring home (after tax), and you also don't have friends in the IT sector. 1200 euro/month is McJob money.
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:22:34
Or lots of pens and paper.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:24:45
check out the 3 different threads here on reddit (where he keeps complaining about them not letting him have the Coin :) He's such a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:17:33
No shit. It's like everyone just woke up and harddrives was 4TB. Give it 10 years and none of these numbers will look unrealistic at all. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 12:37:11
Conspiracy theory: They have advance knowledge of Pokerstars acceptance of BTC and are negotiating to sell the brand before they get marginalized.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:50:43
It's 180 BTC, just get a damn passport. This is just starting to seem really suspicious. You have 2 accounts, won't verify etc. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:51:24
You still don't get it do you? hah, sour idiot that missed the Exodus has sand in his vagina.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:12:07
Hah, go away child.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:25:22
Ha ha, blow me you broke ass child.
