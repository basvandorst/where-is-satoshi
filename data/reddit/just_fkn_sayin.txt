Bitcoin was created by advanced benevolent aliens to help mankind.  So I don't worry about human error or AI.

Cancer is a cash cow for the Big Pharmaceutical companies. There have been alternative treatments showing great promise and even demonstrating a cure, only to have the providers of said treatments shut down, licenses stripped, or even murdered to protect big pharma interests. (no specific source, sorry. Google it and make your own deductions) Point being... No fucking processing power will solve this real world problem of corporate greed.  Just sayin..

A comment from this article on MW:
"The government needs to stop this before real people get really hurt. Bitcoin is now at a bartering value of 1% of America GDP bartering."
As if real people aren't getting hurt already by the govt.  And good luck "stopping" Bitcoin.   Oh the cluelessness really makes my cringe muscles sore.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:45
Yeah, maybe the Ukriane cronies will set the standard for the rest of the worlds cronies, and then we ALL can benefit. (I thought I was being sarcastic, but I realized I may be onto something.  BTC greed used to free the people...how ironic.)
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:14:16
Thanks for this!   Semi noob question: I am wondering what your feelings are for LN implementation in the near term.  I have heard arguments that the core developers aren't addressing LN quickly enough and this poses risk to the network collapsing as it becomes overburdened from the demand.  Is there any truth to this, or is this just more FUD to push Bcash?
