Well duh, of course it differs from stock in that sense. I talking about the idea of demand being driven by speculation and real value being manipulated through limited supply and increased demand. This is elementary economics.  And you buying a stock on the secondary market is not financing shit, it’s only purchased because somebody sees a stock as undervalued and they think they can make some money when the price rises again. 
And bitcoin does add value to society, have you ever had to remit your income oversees? Or send money through western union? That’s just one example

No, that’s the difference between those chasing margins and those who can actually evaluate a portfolio. Go teach yourself before you speak fucktard

Of course, but people also trade real currencies too. International finance is pretty complex like that. And bitcoin is not very different than say stocks in some regards, the gains of some are often funded by the losses of others. The only real danger is that being unregulated, it can be manipulated, but from what I know, that mostly applies to thinner crypto currencies.

Because you create demand? If that’s a good cause, then there was nothing wrong with that character in wolf of Wall Street driving up the price of penny stocks. 
And yeah, Bitcoin is a currency....

You clearly don’t understand what I said. We have access to information on an unprecedented scale. There’s no excuse for your ignorance.

No, you’re not really contributing. Only the IPO and issuance of new stocks actually funds the company in a meaningful way. Other than dividend payments, the growth in stock price only sees real value when you sell, and it’s called capital gains. 
And yes it is. I don’t really know how you can think otherwise.

Instability breeds opportunity if you’re savvy enough.
