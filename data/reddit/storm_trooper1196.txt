When will this exchange have an app? That would be really exciting for me, but for this news. Good job guys! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:01:54
Where are you trying to get yourself at? I probably earn more than you do and I don't want to buy a lambo even if I had more than 300,000 it's impractical. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:10:06
Yes it is, mostly by artificial intelligence or yeah, you can call it bot. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:02:35
Paxful is safe. Might wanna give that a try. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:11:36
But I thought they are already centralised plus they are having some sort of partnership with Facebook.. I don't think the government would agree with being decentralised plus being with facebook whom is a website that can be or is controlled by the government.

Well, as we all know cryptos are volatile so, some try to predict. And by that word. It's not always accurate because anything can happen with cryptocurrency which is both a good thing and a bad thing. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:31:48
Well, if you have some article or proof that this is manipulation i'd be glad to read it. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:14:54
Cool! How much did you get this? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:36:55
Is this a prediction of yours or you got any links that may somehow be substantial and makes a little sense? Because price is manipulated by the higher ups \(whales\) so this depends if they do use it because of the world cup betting some stuff or what.

I heard they build schools in Nigeria, asides from that good gesture I guess it is safe. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:46:59
The current financial system disadvantages developing countries like Africa. This is why I'm a bit optimistic about the future of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:23:22
That's true, not sure if it gets your account suspended or banned though. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:27:46
Well, Paxful doesn't have KYC and looking for offers is much easier.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:19:45
Probably selfish of me but I was hoping btc would crash to 1k usd then buy exactly 1btc then wait for it to go up again. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 07:18:26
Aesthetically I hope they change how it looks. It would make users feel better and make them realize that Paxful continuously fixes site to make it better. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 07:33:47
That's really odd, knowing it should be all over news or at least some articles that they have released an application. Maybe I should ask support about this.. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:08:20
Really wished I bought bitcoins years ago, goddamnit. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:01:30
Correct me if i'm wrong but, isn't it unsafe to use Telegram groups to communicate for trade and all? I mean if a scam happens Localbitcoins doesn't have your back.. that's what i'm trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:18:28
Are people really this scared or skeptical about positive change? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:54:18
I think you should try a peer to peer platform instead, you don't need to wait days or whatnot, except if its a bank transfer its really gonna take awhile.. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:44:42
I think Russia has a huge potential to be a huge market, why do this though.. I mean, and ideas why they did this, asides from what's written in the article? 
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:29:32
Well, I don't really know what's up with Bisq but i'm sure nothing much positive is happening around their company. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 06:27:55
Bisq sucks man, haha! 
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:20:29
Man this is fuckin sad, really even if you think positively that rates would go high as fuck again but seeing the rates now compared to a year ago. Goddamn.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:43:43
Fuckin crazy man, thought we all bout to die or lose money but nah, it's still getting back on its feet! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:28:19
Regardless of its value now, they still use this the most as it helps them survive or make more use of their earnings. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:55:05
Pressing F to pay respects right now..
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:29:54
people should stop using Bisq then, lol! 
@_date: 2018-12-06 11:35:28
I'm more surprised how much restaurants they have, lol! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:55:27
Oh, was thinking some people actually use Luno or Paxful. I mean, Paxful would be a tailor fitted p2p platform since it offers a lot of payment methods and way easier UI. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:19:57
You both can try Paxful, i'm 100% sure it works in Russia. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 12:35:29
What is the most used p2p platform for Venezuela now, if I may ask? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:17:08
This guy, love his optimism. He really believes that bitcoin can change the world, wish I had the mindset. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:04:13
Well, thanks! At least I learned something new. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:22:39
This is actually true, and when it comes to platforms or exchanges, when they lose money, users will blame the company and not take it as their own mistake, but deep down they know that they haven't understood the essence of bitcoin and how to trade properly without violating terms of specific btc platform/exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:23:45
This guy will likely suck his own dick than "bitcoin bottom" expecting some increase in value since someone just dumped like $2 or $3 million last night. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:07:54
For sure, there's nothing wrong with trying out different platforms specially if they work better.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:19:13
Of course it is, I was able to read a comparison of Luno and Paxful which have similarities and Paxful mostly got the advantage since it's available in almost every country, and i'm sure it is being used in Russia as well, go knock yourself out! :)
