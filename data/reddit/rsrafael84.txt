Yes, I have doubled checked their website and they do real time conversion with 0% fee. It seems the best option in the market indeed. They are not issuing cards straight away though. Filled up a waiting list form is required. Cheers!

Thanks for the pointless input anyway

Because they can monetize in different ways and other type of fees?

Non-euro transactions -
Currency conversion fee
1.75% of the Euro value of the transaction amount will
apply. The amount of the transaction will be converted at a
rate of exchange determined by Visa for the date when the
transaction is debited to the Credit Card account
Information above from a bank in Ireland. 
Currency fee is one thing rate of exchange that is determined by Visa or Mastercard is another. My understanding is that the Coinsbank conversion fee (2.5% - 3%) is higher than this Irish bank (1.75%). On top of that both has the Visa/Mastercard rate of exchange/ fees
I would like to know if there is any other option in the market if not 0% at least less than 2.5% conversion fee. I would like to spent BTC without having to convert to EUR to do so in order to pay lunch and doing shopping on a daily basis. 
A 3% conversion fee in my opinion kills any attractiveness and viability to adopt the real time conversion BTC debit card into the daily purchases.  
edit: real time conversion

Did not know about that. I saved it on my bookmarking to have a proper look at it later. It sounds good so far. Cheers!

I tried ANX but with no further explanations they have refused me during the verification process.

good one, I will do!

too expensive - in that way I end up losing more money than through brokers.

Yes... that's what I am doing at the moment. I already got one in Brazil. Is there any in UK that you know/would recommend?
@_date: 2015-09-24 17:05:34
Yes, the problem is the Brazilian banks charges for overseas transactions. Anything is better than that.  =) I am trying to figure out a way through bitcoin that is cheaper than through Western Union or similars...
