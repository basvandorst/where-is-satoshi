I enjoy his ideas but sometimes have to look away because he seems so sweaty and uncomfortable in the big shirts and I start to feel itchy because of it.

@_date: 2018-09-08 19:20:07
I'm glad someone out here feels like I do. You also expressed your opinion in a very well and understandable manner.

Your uses of “in my opinion” and “I am totally sure” in the same sentence tells us only two things: 1) your opinion is worth next to nothing and 2) you are not sure at all.
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:48:19
Long term. 10 years. BTC will still be around. It will be more valuable than it is today. It will go up and down in value per fiat until it becomes a huge ship (market cap) unfazed by the mild fluctuations in value. What if I told you that one day you won't need to exchange it for fiat?
@_date: 2018-08-10 01:53:17
Wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:39:01
Yes, that is a problem and we are currently working on it with second layer scaling solutions (ie, lightning network). Try if you want to think of Bitcoin like the internet in the late 80's. It is under construction but the underlying technology is truly revolutionary if you take the time to understand it's properties.

ICE futures will be settled with actual bitcoin. Same is true for CBOE ETF. Market cap will drastically change with these services in place. This is only the beginning of BTC and other cryptos.

According to that website, there are roughly 22 million wallets with over 0.001 bitcoin in them.
Do the math. Roughly 22,000,000 wallets and 7 billion people on earth = 0.3% of the world actually holds real value in Bitcoin.
Buy more!!!
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:51:18
Why? The upside is so much farther than the downside. Maybe best to dollar cost average down.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:50:28
Absolutely buying. We will laugh when BTC is 100k and wish we bought more.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:34:14

@_date: 2018-05-04 19:02:30
It’s a good question but would take a fortune teller to answer.
It could hit 10k and stay there. It could hit 10k and drop. It could hit 10k and ��!!!
Here is some food for thought. Although past actions are not always indicative of future actions, the last time BTC hit 10k, it took about 2 weeks for it blaze past 20k. Ask me what the price is in a year and I imagine it will be higher but who knows for sure?!
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:03:11

Hi, no offense but when you say “ya” at the end of your sentence it makes me feel uneasy about you. Your agreement with your own idea is assumed but when you reinforce it by affirming yourself in the same sentence you make yourself seem too pushy which makes people like myself less likely to listen. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 01:33:03

Better watch how you spending and what you selling
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:41:04
The Bitcoin community needs to sponsor this person and buy him/her some Bitcoin pom-poms because he/she is here cheering and excited about Bitcoin every day. Also, what is good for Bitcoin is good for all crypto so there is that.

@_date: 2018-06-05 14:01:37
You've been saying that for 6 months already.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:25:44
I have considered that as viable. If I can exchange crypto to pay all of my bills and do so without a significant tax burden then I see no reason why not.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:40:05
We are sitting on the brink of a financial revolution. A lot of money coming to crypto. You might have to wait for it but she will reward all the early believers.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:05:02
You're the delusional one.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:55:32
“Any type of correction.” Where have you been the last 6 months?
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:43:34
I have more than most people invested in crypto. I bought my coins with the intention of holding each one for a period of years. The period of years has not yet finished. I will not sell ANY crypto until the period has been completed. This is my investment strategy. Time in the market &gt; timing the market.
Should I have $0 at the end of the period, at least I know that I saw my plan through to the end without my nerves getting the better of me. What I am trying to say here is that the price at the moment, at least to me, is truly of no concern.
I did not sell my BTC at $20k and I will not sell it if it hits $5k again until the time is up. If BTC were to hit $20k again tomorrow, I still would not sell.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:28:34
It's inevitable even if it doesn't happen in 2018. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:49:25
If it hits that in 2018 then you will think Tom Lee is a g-d. If it hits that in 2019, what, he is a hack? Cut the cards however you want, Tom Lee is a Bitcoin bull and he definitely has the right vision whether or not his time table comes true. He will be rewarded for his insight. I guarantee it.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:49:36
Are you blind? Have you been watching the same Bitcoin over the last decade? I guarantee it will see all time high within 1.5 years from today.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:31:42
You have it backwards. If you did more work then you would have more money to buy more crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:19:07
Preach, brother, preach.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:44:37
You are a fool and won't be the first person that Bitcoin price surprises.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:55:30
Dude relax. Go sell your rent money and get out of the game. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. The price of Bitcoin may go down in the short term but it will definitely rise long term. If you think this 700% gains from a single asset in a year is torture then crypto ain't for you. Hodling will pay off but it takes massive financial balls because it always crashes because of people like you. No offense.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:53:41
Neither one will ever happen again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:44:59

Don't wait too long or you will miss the bottom.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:38:39
Did you see LTC almost 7x in 6 months before the recent halving? Still at 3x from bottom at the moment. BTC may do something similar.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:47:07
Don't worry about the price every hour just put it in a hardware wallet and come back in a few years.

Yes, you can see this happening as the lows get higher and the highs get lower. This likely means a lot of the new money (6 months or less) is stuck in this wave of value (6k to 19k) and waiting for the next wave of new money to bring it past 19k. Some of these people will sell and some will hodl. How far past the price goes is anyone's guess but I bet it will come back down again and the clock will reset at a higher price than 20k. By resetting the clock I mean that we will have newer hodlers but at a much higher value. This has been the case since the beginning of Bitcoin and the past isn't always indicative of the future and blah blah you know what else.

Don't listen to this shill. He's on reddit everyday spreading FUD. If a person has so much time to spend spreading negativity on reddit all day every day, think about what kind of person he/she is. Obviously lives in mom's basement. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:44:53
If it hit $4,500 per BTC I assure you I would buy. I would also buy at $7,000 because I really don’t give a flying falcon what the price is.

Governments don't regulate and accept ponzi schemes. BTC is no scheme. It is the future of money. I say future because it's only at the dawn of acceptance. Wait until the FED announces they have BTC reserves. Only a matter of time.

When it launched, I remember seeing it avalaible for sale at $8,000 each. I went through the checkout process and it definitely would have let me buy at that price. Imagine the ensuing wreckage for those that bought thinking they were buying a real Bitcoin for half off. Oomph.

You even said on your OP that he was suicidal, do you really think you're helping him?! Don't even answer that question because if you say yes you are either sick in the head or just plain socially delinquent and inept. 
Anyone with common sense and decency can see right through your actions and your made up excuses for putting this guy on blast. What you really are is a bully who enjoys preying on the weak. Your behavior is disgusting and childish. Let him live and leave him the hell alone. You're a redditor for 2 weeks and you obviously have a lot to learn.

Don't try to backtrack and attempt to make me look bad just because you edited your previous statement to make it look like a simple suggestion.

My advice to you is not to invest more than you can afford to lose. If losing the money will drastically change your lifestyle then I think that is a good sign you’re investing too much. Also realize when you purchased you were probably hoping for and maybe even expecting 10x gains. Remember that It can also go down 10x before going back up. Ask yourself why did you buy this? Do you believe it will go back up? Can you remain financially solvent while you wait for it to go back up?
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:07:52

Ok, thanks for the type up. I understand S curve adoption. I also understand how a fraudulent exchange could close up due to a fractional reserve scheme (ie, ponzi) when customers do a run on the exchange and attempt mass withdrawals if they become spooked. What I do not understand is how the S curve + a run on the exchange = a spike in price.

Weird flex but ok.

USDC is not a crypto and can be seized by Coinbase at will. This is similar to a bank with your fiat.

Can you hide your life savings in gold up inside your ass? Better yet, can you memorize the gold? Both of these things can be done with crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:53:23
I agree with you 100%
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:51:14
Thank you, wizard.
