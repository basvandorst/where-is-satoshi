That was a hacker climbing through your display port to steal your coins

Well it's too late now but usually smoothing the pixels with a pixel squeegee is enough to close the hole and thwart the attack.

Except that every transaction is recorded on a public blockchain. Try monero if you want something private.

Yea a clean computer, so any fresh install of Windows / OSX / Linux will work. Linux is just convenient because you can boot the full OS off of a USB or CD

Nobody cares what your talking about because you just demonstrated that you don't care how the technology behind bitcoin or any alt coin actually works.

Your logic is incredibly broken. The internet is not a store of value it is a communications infrastructure. If someone came along and said "I can double your bandwidth and remove your data cap" that would be a good incentive to join their internet. You are so misguided and so presumptuous. Just generally a frustration to try to have an actual constructive conversation with. Know that 90% of people aren't even going to try to talk to you because it is so obvious you are just regurgitating "hail bitcoin" with your right arm raised high. Nothing you say comes across as rational, you sound like a fanatic. Patronize me all you want, anyone with a brain has already written off your circular logic.

And the same could happen with bitcoin. Bitcoin and altcoins are completely equal in that they only have the value which we give them. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:31:03
One day you realize the hipocrisy of your thinking. Nothing separates bitcoin other than that it came first. Everything bitcoin is today could change tomorrow. Enjoy your "extensive cross-disciplinary research".

Alright, you have me interested. Signed up :)

Yes, it is my preferred exchange. Works well, verification is easier, and you can deposit using interact bill payments.

It has everything to do with capitalism because it's a capitalist system.
 Central Bank prints the money everyone rushes to claim their share of it to accrue more capital.
If we had a say a communist system where some random dictator divided all the wealth and there was no currency we would all be rushing to be their friend to accrue favours because it indirectly transforms into capital.

Yea, in past month I've started to realize what a shady sub this is.

Good luck getting XP working on current gen hardware.

That's not how it works. The USA's 21 trillion debt is not owned by people, it's a number. The days where money is backed by gold are gone.

Good luck finding compatable hardware if something breaks

Who have they attacked for monetary reasons? Besides maybe Libya.

What? AMD and Intel are both American companies. Both spawned off of Fairchild Semiconductors way back in the day.

Bitcoin is compromised as long as you can buy it and the computers that mine it for fiat.
EDIT: Didn't realize this was sorry boys keep on believing. My point was that distribution of fiat is incredibly unequal and as long as the primary use of bitcoin is to trade it for fiat that inequality will transfer over to bitcoin. It is still possible even barring "future tech" to compromise bitcoin with fiat.

If fiat dies suddenly I would doubt we would have a stable internet to run the bitcoin network on. Do you honestly expect the world's wealthiest and most powerful people to say "oh! Our currency is dead. I guess those bitcoin holders are now the richest people on earth." 
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:13:11
Every AMD computer too for that matter. Think about that for a second and realize what that means.

Oh do you know this Satoshi personally? Or are you just making assumptions. What a dumb comment.

Blockada themselves say it doesn't work for Youtube. Check their website.

Doesn't work for Youtube tho.

Evidently not

Bitcoin might be somewhat decentralized. The internet however is far from decentralized with key choke points all being controlled by government/big corporations.
