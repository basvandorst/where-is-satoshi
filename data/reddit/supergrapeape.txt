Thanks, but no thanks :) I had someone else offer me them for $500k each!

I'll think about the risk, but it just seems like it'll be $1,000+ poorly wasted. However, you mentioning the BitFury miners got me searching, I'm interested in that 110GH/s unit, but nearly $100k, and 10,000W to power the damn thing? Seems pointless.

Alright, seems you know quite a lot about this compared to myself, do you have any recommendations? If not, I have a purchase in mind.

NameCoin, BitCoin, PPCoin, and TerraCoin are all SHA-256 POW, FPGA and ASIC builds should work perfectly on these currencies.

verify will have the bot post here. I always though you needed 100 comment karma to have it work. You can try +bitcointip or +@_date: 2013-07-21 03:50:12
Yeah, uh, sorry about forcing you guys out (just bought 800GH/s of mining equipment). Maybe try moving on to Namecoin? I'm sure you could potentially earn more through that.

That looks really interesting. I think I might get a few of those.. 3 and a half months of wait time is just asking for the difficulty to increase to (pure speculation) 75m+. If I get 16 of those, 400GH/s at 75m difficulty with an absolute minimum power draw of 640W is a 95 day break-even time, approximately $235 a day of revenue. I'll certainly think about it.

I hadn't heard of ASX before this, I'll look in to it. Thanks for the detailed suggestion
Edit: Looking at the prices, 150GH/s for $2,249 seems a little ridiculous. I was expecting at least $5,000+ for a system like that.
Edit 2: From a Google search, that case front they show is nearly exactly the same as the Corsair Obsidian 900D case, but.. shorter. [ASX Project]( [Obsidian 900D](
Edit 3: I'm convinced it's a scam. The [censored chip they show]( is an Apple Quickdraw Graphics chip. Their heatsink picture seems to be unique, but their power supply image is literally the fifth result when searching "computer power supply".

I'll do some more research on that, this seems like it could work out.
Edit: Using that 20%, I wasn't that far off. By the middle of November the difficulty will (hopefully) be around 78m.

I understand that investing would mean profits without having to manage hardware, but at 4.65btc/share (most recent price), that's 23,250btc to get me on the board, which would be an ideal position. It's also 2.2m USD, which is certainly not what I expected to be spending. I think I'm just going to purchase somewhere between 16 and 32 25GH/s boards from BitFury. It's 1300W of draw for 32, but 800GH/s is something I certainly don't want to pass on. By October when I receive the parts, an estimation leads me to believe the difficulty will be around 78m, resulting in around $400/day in profit after power costs.

Interesting, it's certainly something I'll look in to.

I have no expertise in this sort of thing, and my current position in life doesn't make this a practical option.
@_date: 2013-07-18 23:24:25
I think I'm likely going to stay away from individual sellers and untrusted small businesses.
