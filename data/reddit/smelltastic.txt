Insufferable people win all the time; they'll fail because bitcoin is garbage.

Who says they can't be both?

That's seriously the most hilarious shit I've read this week.
"We aren't a cult because OUR God is the true one!!"

@_date: 2014-09-21 04:23:16
you misspelled "cultists"
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:27:52
What you're looking for is confirmation that bitcoin is going to the moon, and that you can still make a bunch of money by holding onto it. If you look specifically for that, you'll undoubtedly find it in spades. That's not going to help you make the *right* decision, just the one you *want* to make.
What you should be looking for is truth and reality, whether it's what you want it to be or not. *Then* you can make the right decision.
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:14:57
That is literally exactly what every cultist says about their own. Holy shit how do you not get that.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:39:51
because the pump-and-dump has already been dumped, they're losing money, and beginning to realize it's not going back up. Duh
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:47:51
Right. It's a good idea to unbind the concept of a currency from the specifics of its technical implementation. To do otherwise can ultimately only stifle flexibility and innovation.

Congratulations, today you are a man.
To say "there is no God" is fair enough in the literal sense, but there is a deeper meaning to it. If you thought Bitcoin was going to be some savior of humanity, if you thought the demise of bitcoin is a victory for evil, you had turned Bitcoin into your God. *There is no God*.
If you keep searching for cults, you'll just keep finding them.

Well he *used* to...
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:31:02
That sounds like rebel scum talk. You ain't been hanging out with [the resistance]( have you?
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:49:57
and money laundering protects the perpetrator. see how that works?

Unfortunately you can only do that for as long as the community has actual money to throw at it

Sorry, I wasn't aware GBS was pay-only now, I thought you only needed to pay to post.
Here is the bulk of the text: 
This was written before the November bubble exploded. A few people who don't understand gambling got upset over the fact that they were talked out of buying before the price went up due to the marketing blitz at that time. That doesn't mean Bitcoin was a "good" investment before - any more than a bet on 23 in roulette is a good investment even if the number does come up - and it certainly isn't now that the bubble's over. But then, it *could* always happen again, and you *might* sell before it crashes.. how lucky do you feel?
But, do your own research, learn from your own experiences, and make your choices yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:02:35
Careful, from what I understand if you talk too much sense in here you'll end up getting banned.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:00:38
As I'm sure you've realized judging by the few responses you've already gotten in this and the dupe thread, is not the right place to ask this question. You're probably not going to find good answers at all on Reddit. I'd recommend asking in the Bitcoin thread on the Something Awful forums at  I promise you'll get more out of a $10 investment there than by spending any more money on Bitcoin.

I also enjoy blaming victims for getting scammed rather than the scammers or the system that harbors them.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:11:46
I can't tell if you're serious or not, but in case you are, here.

Correct, buying above market is unbelievably stupid.

Tee, hee, hee! Toh, hoh, hoh!
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:06:09
Yes! Force them to set a ban on all online currency. Then when someone manages to develop a cryptocurrency that resolves the myriad problems Bitcoin has, it still won't be able to get off the ground because it will already be pre-emptively banned. Brilliant!
...oh wait, you're not a shill? This isn't whoops

FDIC has nothing to do with coverage from fraud.

I hope this isn't real, no one can be this stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:30:29
My prediction requires understanding of some advanced math, like imaginary quadrideviants, hypernegatives and quantum integrals. You wouldn't understand it. All you need to know is up up up!
