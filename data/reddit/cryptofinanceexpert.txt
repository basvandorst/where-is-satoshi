Tim wouldn't lie to me. He drives a really nice car and gets expensive hair cuts

Do I believe what you just said? I have no choice but to look at the evidence presented. If you say that you don't hold crypto, I'll believe you. I don't have enough tin foil or free time to sit around presenting skepticism (with 0 basis) to every claim I read. 
Is you assertion that Musk is lying? If so, what evidence do you have to support that claim? Nobody forced him to publicly comment on his crypto holdings. 
Additionally, if he *was* hodling, don't you think he would - you know, want to be proactive about it? Musk has a lot of clout in tech and as someone has already mentioned, an endorsement from musk would only help broaden awareness. If he *is* hodling, it seems like a pretty dumb thing to publicly deny participation in a platform that would directly benefit from an admission to the contrary.  
Any other theories? Do you have any evidence at all to support the contrary? Because the evidence I have provided is a public statement from Elon Musk. 
Its true — anybody can lie. But do you seriously go through life assuming that everyone is a liar? Because that must be fucking awful for you. 
Additionally, why would you think that a man who has made Billions of dollars without crypto would suddenly want to risk any of it on a highly speculative market? He can make much more by simply continuing to build his companies in a manageable way, instead of letting it ride on Bitcoin. Just use your head dude.

It's a sure thing, duder!

Agreed. Very dumb to gamble

Musk himself owns little to no crypto. He said recently that he has a small amount $300 worth that was gifted to him, but has never touched crypto otherwise.
