A bull points it’s horns upwards while shi**ing, and a bears balls are downward in the water when it catches fish. 
Mr. D Jones observed this once when in the wild and thus the stock market was born....

This is actually a Warren buffet quote... google it. “If you can’t stomach a ... % loss you shouldn’t be an investor... etc.”  :) I wish Warren had better things to say about BTC though. I think him and Charlie (the other Charlie..lol) are too afraid of new technology and the idea of holding a digital store of value. Not to mention the freedom it brings...

Hold strong in the water of douchbaggery , the no-coiners once told us it was not worth it in the past... now they are still poor and Lambos for those who said go “f[]ck urself” .    Well why listen to the FUD’ge packers now... stay strong and hold now while the blood is flowing thick and the weak are scared.

I ran my s9s on BTCpool for a few months and then on slushpool and the payout have been slightly higher and more consistent from slush. 
I do like BTCpools iOS app a little more than slushes but they both get the job done.

What’s the problem??    It’s like a Swiss bank account for the people who cannot afford Swiss bank accounts........if we did a little digging I’m sure Obama might have some over seas storage. ;)

If you want to know if bitcoin will fall once the dollar does....look at Venezuela. The merchants are only able to keep a profit if they quickly transfer their high inflated currencies into crypto.   Showing everyone that crypto can sustain itself.  
The United States was a poor country that create a dollar out of thin air, backed it by gold (supposably) , and then just printed the crap out of it to fill the needs of the many.... hmm kinda resembles the concept of crypto.  
I’d trade centralized corrupted currencies for a decentralized version any day..even if it means not having the gold standard to back the value. which is a joke anyways and not real, the very reason we had the standard was to prevent what banks are already doing today. 
Whoever controls the money , controls the masses.
