I started buying at $25, but could only buy 10 a day due to Coinbase's crazy KYC system

totally agree about the rampant consumerism points made here, however do you think people buy new shit because they are worried about the currency being worthless or just because they like buying new shit and are generally irresponsible with saving or investing money ?
That being said, you would love  lots of anti-consumerism ravings

So lets say we have a point of entry for usd / btc buying and selling (coinbase for me).  I buy btc for usd from my bank account and then sell btc for usd into my bank account.  Once I purchase btc, I send it to bitstamp and then buy and sell for a few months and clock some gains.
Eventually, since getting usd out of foreign exchanges is a nightmare, I buy back btc and send to coinbase where I sell to usd.  
Couldn't I declare these gains once they physically end up in my bank account rather than sitting out in eastern europe btc space ?

A bit more perspective would help - is $10K a substantial portion of your savings or can you afford to lose ?

panic selling never works

Are you losing money less times than you are making it ?  (i.e. profitable and therefore algorithms that allow you to find better savings and keep the difference).
Wouldn't there be a motivation to set your algorithm pricing so that you can always beat it and find more savings to keep a bigger portion ?

does this include purchasing stocks denominated in btc ?
