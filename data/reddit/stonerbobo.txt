Inflation is not a "sneaky" scheme to steal your money.. its a mechanism to make people spend money as opposed to hoarding it and create growth... if everyone hoarded the money, there would be nothing to fund new businesses or create new jobs.
I don't know what the fuck fiat money has to do with being a "slave". Slaves don't get paid.

Yes i agree. In a way, the more heavily a currency is used, the more stable/real it is. As the largest holder of currency in any nation (due to taxes), the governments use is the bootstrapping force. It takes money in exchange for public service, and gives money to employees and sometimes citizens. It also transacts with other countries (e.g selling govt bonds to other countries) meaning those countries also accept it as real. 
So i would say a currency is backed by how many people accept it, and the govt is the biggest force in making that happen because it acts on behalf of all the countries people.

Heres another showerthought for ya: All attempts to regulate/modify/censor online content are the same difficulty. Yet plenty of governments manage to do that just fine.

This is a fundamental problem with no easy solution. 
Take democracy for example - a literal democracy is everyone votes on every thing, but people don't have enough time or patience to educate themselves and vote on every issue. So we elect representatives and delegate most of the decisions to them.
If most people don't know or care enough to take informed stances on major political issues affecting their country, how much time do you think they will spend on this? How many people know enough to read the original SegWit proposals, understand them, weigh the alternatives and come to a decision? Most decisions are delegated to a few leaders just like politics - because of human nature and the constraints of how much we can do in a day.
