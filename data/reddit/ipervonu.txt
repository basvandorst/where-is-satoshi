When customers or potential customers see a message like that, it gives them a sense of protection and they will make a purchase rather than worrying if a site has put protection up. I dunno that's my two cents :D

Bitcoin is NOT  a stock you use to trade. It is a currency. When will people learn this
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:48:57
You are the type of person that shouldn't be allowed to use bitcoin.

Yes it's fine, But no exchange should have over 30 percent of the market. Have you not seen what happens when gox goes down? Diversify the currency bro.

just ignore it, We don';t need a million subreddits for bitcoin. That will confuse everyone :/

haha yes that!!

BTC is not stock you trade. It is currency. Do you trade your USD's for other currencies in hopes of gaining more money? This is why the btc economy is so unstable. Assholes take it for what it isn't and the value fluctuates so much :/

Stop complaining. Nothing you say or can do to make them stop :)

There is really nothing we CAN do. People continue to look at BTC for what it's not and it ruins the value. If people used btc for what it was intended for then the currency would be tons more stable
