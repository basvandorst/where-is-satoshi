Agree. It's safer in the long run for the market to correct itself and not prop it up on "good feelings".

I'm not very informed about Bitcoin. But isn't the goal of bitcoin not to have borders and rely on governments? Think of the market in China falling, the US isn't going to intervene because it's not their jurisdiction to do so.
What makes you believe that the bitcoin market falls under the jurisdiction of the US?
Also, 'avert a recession', if bitcoin drops to $0.00 USD there will be no recession. There isn't a recession to avert.

Why do bitcoiners on this sub speak with so much drama like they're attempting to rally the last of the human race before an alien race attempts to wipe them out?

And it makes me believe those people will then stay away from crypto as they were burned. With all the new comers in the rise to $18k, those looking to get out when they can won’t be coming back.

I would assume in any deals you would have to eat the cost of it. Make sure to include it as a line item in any negotiations.

Well, you could buy a bag like the Hauly. 
Specifically made to carry $1m USD in $100's circulated or uncirculated.
