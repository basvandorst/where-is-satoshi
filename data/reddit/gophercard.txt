They charge you 10% from the value of your existing IRA/401K when you roll over your existing account.  That's a little insane from a fee perspective and short-term profit-taking from the bitcoin IRA companies if you ask me.

Have you tried the Shift card?  they are the supposedly the world's first bitcoin debit card (visa)....

That's pretty amazing.  In which country?  If you know of them, I would love to speak to them!  Trying solve the big problem of making bitcoin more mainstream...

Yeah, I hear you and transaction fees are the killer there..  what about an Amazon gift card that was discounted enough to offset those fees?
