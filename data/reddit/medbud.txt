I thought BTC was now a store of value and not a payment method. Even with Segwit and Lightning...what makes this better than paying with Yen? Is this only good news for people who already have lots of BTC?
Does Yamada accept cash and plastic? Why would I want to pay with my deflationary digital gold, aka BTC? Assuming adoption continues, won't BTC just continue to increase in value?

Bitcoin itself can't benefit from DNS type services...if you need to nickname certain addresses, just label them in a wallet. As others have pointed out each transaction should be to a freshly created address. 
You could develop a wallet type that has an ' pseudonym, and if someone payed through the same wallet type they could just pay to the pseudonym, and the wallet network would know all addresses belonging to a particular wallet (because the wallet passphrase is secret, and hosted by the wallet app provider, and linked to the pseudonym), although it seems like it could get complicated...

So POW ledger tech puts the power and responsibility of banks into the users hands, adding security to the overall network. 
Then we make companies to centralize all data (store your BTC), and charge you fees to access it. 
Sounds like a bank. I see no point to this service! 
Why not keep your money in national currency, and then buy BTC when you want to transfer if you are concerned about volatility?

Thanks for your reply. I was curious about the network required for btc to be functional. I was trying to imagine how mining would work... On dial up, mesh, tor.

I'm quickly starting to compare this to the scenario in which a kind well meaning parent gives a single toy to two children. The children admire the toy, share the toy, decide they each want the toy for themselves, fight over the toy... Soon comes the part where the toy breaks, the parent says I told you so, and the kids cry and pout and blame everyone but themselves.

So, we agree, no one does 3USD international bank transfers.
As you rightly say, currently the best bet is alt coin chains. If you're moving less than 1M USD per transfer, you should be fine volume wise. So, I'm just speculating that's about 99.99% of BTC traffic that we agree is better off moving to alts currently.
I'm waiting for LN. But don't think it's that genius. It will still cost you more than alternatives. 
Old crippled grandpa BTC may be relevant for another 10-15 years as a store of value, and as an example for the history books. Like windows xp. People in real production environments will move on... Or have already.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:27:29
I love the vision...free transactions, off chain scaling...will keep waiting for a while...and use other cheaper options until then.
Just so I can picture this: LN is a single network, off-chain, that connects every user for free (after the channel fee), for instant verification of transactions, and can process 1mBTC just like 10000BTC. So I buy my coffee, and Bank A and Bank B settle overnight both using the same network. 
Do I have to pay a fee to close the channel? Once all the channels have been opened, what do the miners hash? When the reward per block is small, what will the fees be for a channel? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:46:50
Not trolling, not fighting. I'm arguing.
This thread is trying to joke that mBTC are cheap enough for an average Joe, because now BTC is just *so* expensive. They just conveniently forgot to mention the cost of sending 1000 BTC or 1mBTC is the same.
Core-porate coin is for a corporate settlement layer. This is not p2p cash. This is not banking the unbanked. No one can use this coin of they want quick confirmations and zero fees. Thinking LN will magically solve this is foolish (there will be fees to open and close channels, if a channel is permanently open, then you're not using the blockchain, so what's the point?).
BTC can't be everything to everyone. If you want to buy 3 USD of cryto and actually be able to use it, why not ETH or LTC, or some tiny coin?
Poor suckers trying to accumulate 1BTC to be in a made up club, really being bled by whales.

That's right. Difficulty is a function of hash rate and block time. As hash rate grows, difficulty is increased to maintain block times. When I say power, I am referring to electric power. To add hash rate, generally, people consume more electric power. Hash rate also climbs because of ASIC development. 
This whole tendency (mining for profit) won't last past 2025 in my opinion. Crypto will move from blockchain to DAG's, and mining will be used to confirm transactions, not lord over network users while taking in millions in profits per day. 
The model of crypto where mining for profit and ubiquitous use of crypto both exist is a paradox.

who sends 3.30 USD by bank transfer?
do remember in 2012-13, zero fee transactions, instant confirmations because mempool was empty, and blocks were not full?
now, why pay 30 USD cents on BTC network, when I can do the exact same transfer for a fraction of a penny, or for zero fees, and 10000x faster?
BTC is like an old man, crippled and deformed from arthritis. You should try some of these young spry cryptos: LTC, ETH, IOT

Hahaha...good looking out coinbase.
You know, sometimes I carry my change in my left pocket, but if there is a hole, maybe I move it to my right pocket. In BTC this means changing wallets, aka, sending my own BTC to another adress. I don't expect to be richer, but I expect to have the same amount of money once I shifted my change. In BTC, if I buy one mBTC and move it back and forth a few times from right to left, I have zero left!

It was worthless at the time... By the time it had traction and there was an exchange for trading.. It was less than 1usd I think. The legend is of course the 10000 btc for a 20USD pizza ordered over the Atlantic ocean.... The moment btc became valuable... Mmmm, pizza, 2.5M USD/slice.
Every 4 years I think, the mining reward halves... That's why it's digital gold... The rush is ending, the scarcity + demand is deflationary.
It's academically and experimentally such an amazing phenomenon to experience... Just hope greedy humans don't ruin it for everyone (ie. break the network).

A wallet can be 'local', on your phone, pc, other hardware (trezor), or it can be web based...like coinbase. Local means you have your private keys on your device...and hosted means someone else has them. 
Exchanges usually have an integrated 'wallet' service...it might just be a token place holder depending on how the exchange  works, so not necessarily on the blockchain, but rather in some 'in-house' accounting. It is recommended to not leave huge amounts in hosted services, as they could be lost due to bad management, security problems, etc. , that being said, depending on the amount, and the current fees, the less you move the btc the better. 
I've always liked 'android bitcoin wallet', but recently diversified, and find Coinomi to be pretty sweet (multi-coin, and integrated with Shapeshift.io exchange service). Don't know bitpay but it is apparently the new version of copay. Mycelium and Armory are also good to explore.

Blockchain solutions are a nascent industry, today I was told a leading bank in switzerland fintech will have btc wallets soon, and trading to various fiats... but it's the underlying value of the tech is why i hodl...to feel i'm invested in the experiment.
The original post was because of the schism that has appeared between the two camps...if you can get past all the name calling, it is becoming technically incomprehensible to the lay man. And those that do understand the technicalities seem to be heavily invested in their side 'winning'. I understand that in the end, we all win...and I see de/merits of both camps...Blockstream/core is expert, but segwit is proprietary(?)...Ultimate scales 'onchain', but is buggy. I suppose if nothing gets forced politically, then a good technical compromise will emerge. 
I guess that's part of the roller coaster to the moon...decentralized steering, and schrodinger's road maps. I miss the good old days when there was one president of bitcoin :) it's bizarre watching the politicization of the tech.

I don't know how all those bank transfers work...but at the moment I believe it's through end of day settlements and the SWIFT/BIC system. BTC could replace that...but it will take a good decade or two. At the moment, the banks use the same system of ledgers, it's just not a distributed POW ledger. They are not actually 'sending' money. The LA branch just reduces a ledger balance, and the london one increases theirs.

I suppose there is some function of network hash rate to kW hours... So yeah. I am guessing there is a limit to the hashing efficiency of silicon... So you just need more and more power as the hash rate/difficultly grow.
I remember when people talked about putting a solar panel on a satellite and having it mine from earth orbit... To pay for itself.
At some point I think all nodes were 'wallets'/miners...Then there were 'thin wallets', right around the time mining rigs started being a thing to 'preorder'. My memory is a bit foggy.

i agree, as others have pointed out the implementation of the block chain in the btc form has enabled third parties to trust each other through an easily verified and yet difficult to fake credential.   the fact that early adoption is rewarded gives the genius implementation some momentum, and has successfully created a snowball effect.    if not btc itself, some future form will go far in streamlining finance...check out votecoin, zerocoin, mastercoin...

By dollars, do you mean cash? There is a clear argument there that might be too obvious to present...why is cash such a small part of our planet's economy? Why in history did we move from barter, to coin, to electronic banking, (...to btc)?
And do you mean now, or in the future? Now, you should probably just use cash money dollars if btc is too difficult to implement (although it is ridiculously easy in fact). In the future you will use them because it will be ubiquitous, easy as cash, powerful as international transfer, and the cheapest.
BTC is currency 2.0. Its like what the web is to tv and print media, but to currency. The current volatility makes it hard to comprehend...but if you have ever traded forex, you see similar volatility on the pips level...just wait for btc adoption to mature, and the macro volatility will subside. This will make it seem more like the dollars you are used to...more or less always worth the same amount in relation to 'a basket of currencies' (don't forget that you also have to buy dollars to be able to spend them if you are not paid in dollars for your work). 
Arguments about technological barriers to adoption are short lived. Mobile phones are everywhere after 20 years, and 80 y.o.'s post youtube videos. When there is a revolutionary technology that offers the everyday person more options, it is inevitably adopted. In 5 years your phone will have an encrypted wallet built in, and the toothfairy will be leave a mbtc under your pillow.
With BTC we have anonymity and transparency both *to some degree*. This itself is attractive to many players in the markets and in industry, not to mention data-mining, marketing, intelligence, and surveillance agencies world wide.
BTC is still a fledgling of its potential self, in market cap terms. As the both consumers and merchants are attracted by low transaction fees-and the  btc economy grows- it will probably endure resistance from entrenched conservative forces that stand to lose profits (banks fees) but due to design principles and community organisation btc will survive...and those progressive forces (btc friendly banks) that see opportunity will create profit, where the old guard falls behind. It is already easier and cheaper to pay with btc for products and services than with credit cards...all costs factored in (btc network power costs vs. payment provider infrastructures)...when the adoption peaks, btc will be like cash you can hand over to anyone on the planet like you were standing next to them. In a global economy this has value in itself.
There is no doubt that the cards are stacked against btc. I see the barrier being scale...if there was mass adoption there would be 100's of millions of transactions per minute, which (correct me if I am wrong please) would make the blocks enormous...and the electricity cost of computing the block chain could become draining. Maybe renewable energy and moore's law should keep us ahead of the curve until quantum computing arrives? If it doesn't become the world currency credit, it will take a nice chunk of visa/mc, paypal, western union, bank transfer business at least.
