50MW of shit does not come out of thin air. Deploying, manufacturing, rolling them into a datacenter, hell even finding 50MW is a god damn challenge.

Just 29 Days ago the global hashrate was 471 ph/s. **Something is up**. I fail to see how 200ph/s of mining equipment/data center space can be deployed this fast. 
Assuming this was all done with one of the most efficient miners, atminer s7 @ 0.25 J/Gh/s, we're talking about 50MW of power &amp; ~44k antminer units. More like 65MW+ for headroom. That is absurd.

For those who don't know, this is KNC's operation. 
"Quote from: Biodom on Today at 09:10:50 AM
KnC switched over their hashing from eliguis pool (1A73ExsM2doRwTLp82rv5U36QHbBFmHD1X) to "Other": eligius dropped and "Other" increased in 24hr from 13% to 23%, hence KnC is approximately 10% of network right now (which roughly what HD1X was hashing at). HD1X accumulated roughly 4800BTC. Nice going.
Anybody care to do blockchain analysis to try to identify their new main wallet?
Still the same:  "

Yes, and at the time I got that wrong.

Who says shit like this? "What you don't know about him is that he's worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll never admit to starting Bitcoin." 
He sounds like he has aspergers or is a mental wackjob. Don't buy it at all.

Seans outpost has been a scam from the beginning. People who threw their bitcoin so blindly at them thinking that everything is 100% accounted for were so naive. Remember the empty brown lunch bags? Guy nonstop spams r/bitcoin and everyone gobbles his dick.

Brian is 100% spot on. Blockstream is what happens when you shove a bunch of idealistic engineers in a room. Analysis to paralysis etc etc.

You've obviously never done a business deal before. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:01:51
it's almost as if a small group of miners have the ability to manipulate the price to keep themselves in the game.
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:52:44
think about it. Check out the history of this subreddit. Anytime there is a spike in bitcoin, everyone and their mother wants to start mining,  purchases equipment, increases the difficulty, which takes away from big miner profits. TLDR: never make your business look too attractive, otherwise others will be taking bites out of your lunch soon.
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:21:46
You do realize when you have 10, 20, 50, 100MM+ on the line in mining equipment, debt, etc it's within your best interest to keep your business afloat? 
A couple handshakes of these fine folk and some of their biz partners and it's taken care of.

BTC trading is completely unregulated. Good luck catching any of this.

Sure. but we're not talking about that now.

that would not be great for their business though.

Everyone has forgot everything about original bitcoin. The shit code, the bugs  , and people still don't think Craig &amp; David were able to write the original client. The current bitcoin community needs to get over itself. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:43:21


It bugs me when people say this. you can easily have a blockchain without bitcoin. All you need is hashing power. Say I'm JPMorgan, and I want to transfer assets blockchain style. I set up my own blockchain, and buy a some X amount of hashing power and point it at my chain, which guarantee's an amount of safety for that blockchain. I.e it would take X/2 hash power to disrupt my safety. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 04:18:44
Craig is still alive. Dave on the other hand is not unfortunately.
