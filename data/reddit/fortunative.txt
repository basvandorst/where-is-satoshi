I was the one that originally put this quote from Nick here on reddit some time ago.  It comes from a larger podcast with a lot of discussion around Bitcoin.  If you took the time to listen what you would realize is that Nick is pretty humble in general despite being probably the most important person in Bitcoin second to Satoshi in laying the technical foundation for the technology.  You'll find he isn't "fond of [his] engineering prowess".
You'll also find that he wants the problem fixed and he wants a sound Bitcoin just like all of us.  The problem is that Bitcoin is, by design, very inefficient since it's a flood-network, adding more nodes doesn't help, and increasing the block size causes external costs among other problems.
He's not saying there isn't a problem or being arrogant, he's just saying that calls for simple block size increases won't solve the problem of high demand for block space and that lots of hard science and engineering needs to be done to find better solutions than simply increasing the linear size of the flood network.  Many people call for the simple fix that nearly every competent engineer says is problematic.
Calm down a bit and stop ascribing bad intentions to some of the luminaries that helped invent this technology.  They are working hard to come up with solutions.  We all want this technology to succeed and process large amounts of transactions without high fees.

And that would be fine if there were truly a free market for Paypal-like competitors to operate in, but it turns out that it's exceedingly difficult to mount any kind of competitive challenge to Paypal, even with great technology because the regulatory hurdles in the United States are enormous.  
Each state has it's own monetary authority so you have to be licensed in practically every state, not to mention all the federal requirements.  Every state has bonding requirements, fingerprinting, long drawn out application processes, and huge sets of complicated regulations and rules to follow.  You need to hire expensive attorneys and file in every state and also file special reports for each state that also vary.  It's a nightmare.
That regulatory burden creates very large barriers of entry for potential competitors.  Not only that, but payment networks like Paypal also enjoy network effects on top of that!  The government regulatory authorities have therefore served as a centralizing force and killed competition and "freedom" as you say.  So when your few payment provider options on the table make a choice because they don't like something you say or do, you are severely impacted with few other options to turn to.  
That's why decentralization, censorship resistance, and Bitcoin are so important.

Bugs are totally unacceptable, but they happen in any system, not just Bitcoin Core.  Tell me a system that doesn't ever have bugs?  Obviously the solution here is be more conservative, and do more review and more checking, and do more extended review of the developer who introduced the issue.  But no process is 100% foolproof, so if you think changing a process will remove the possibility of all bugs, you live in a dream world.

I don't have a problem with that part of what cobra-bitcoin said, what I do take issue with is "the community should consider forking Bitcoin Core if there isn't adequate response".  The thing is the code is open source, anyone in the community could have looked at it.  To fork you have to have people who have the time and interest and skill to actually look at problems and fix them.  There isn't some magical community group out there ready to fork who could do a better job that couldn't already have looked right now and reviewed pull requests now and helped contribute to fixing issues now.  It's not like developers working on core are ignoring known issues!  Forking only works when one group is ignoring a problem, not taking active suggestions from anyone on bugs that may exist.  That's why this was such an inane suggestion.

His contribution is that, being a well known cryptographer, he engaged with Satoshi, encouraged him when others ignored him, helped provide feedback and bug reports, etc.  What if nobody ever engaged or responded to Satoshi?  Would he have trudged on regardless?  Finney's contribution, though small, might be larger than you might think.  
I don't buy that he was the creator; he had a lot of good evidence that he was not that he [showed a journalist before his death]( and he had no reason not to say it at that advanced stage of disease when they were trying to get to the bottom of who was Satoshi.

Yes, they could censor them, and this is what's known as a 51% attack.  Any bad actor gaining 51% or more of the hash power can't steal funds, but they could censor transactions indefinitely.  
If it were truly a "pool" doing the attack where multiple parties contribute hash power, if any pool attempted this the other parties contributing hash would stop mining on that pool immediately, ending their ability to do such an attack.  
If the hash power was owned or controlled by one entity alone or a collusion of entities that didn't care about the damage such attack would do, there is only one solution I'm aware of right now to stop a 51% attack, and that is a hard fork to change the proof of work algorithm such that all the hardware investment the entity or pool made to get 51% of the hash power would be made worthless.  This is known as a "nuclear option" though because it would be highly disruptive.  But the given that the nuclear option exists, an entity or pool would be foolish to attempt it since Bitcoin users could execute this nuclear option if needed in an emergency.

It's very simple.  Bill Gates receives billions in donations from Warren Buffet for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Warren Buffet runs a company that owns major stakes in major banks that could be displaced to some degree by Bitcoin.
Buffet has said he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand (he missed investing in major tech companies), and he doesn't typically invest in commodities.  He invests in companies that produce earnings (rent seeking).  He doesn't understand Bitcoin, so he won't invest in it.  I think that's fine, I don't think anyone should invest in it if they don't understand it.
If Buffet says something bad about Bitcoin, Bill Gates is not going to want to contradict him immediately after when they are friends and Gates is receiving billions of Buffet's money.

Some major proponents of Bitcoin Cash have tried to trick people into "Buying Bitcoin" when what they are really buying Bitcoin Cash, but that hasn't been made clear.
Those same proponents have also tried to rebrand Bitcoin the currency to Bitcoin Core, the name of one of the Bitcoin clients while not similarly branding their coin "BitcoinABC" to match their fork of that same client.  
These same proponents also call Bitcoin Cash an "upgrade" of Bitcoin, which is at best a mildly deceptive way to describe a fork with a different philosophy and community.

Yes, plenty of people understand the technical implications.  It's quite a simple change.  It is basically a flag that *optionally* excludes previous output commitment in the transaction digest.  It makes no change to the peer to peer protocol.  It makes no change to the properties of existing transactions in use.  It makes no change to the social contract.  It requires no further resources.  Old clients will be backwards compatible with no changes.  It's as safe as any fork can be due to it's extremely limited scope.
Nobody is saying this needs to be implemented right away, or that it shouldn't undergo adequate peer review, but it's quite a simple and contained change.  A basic working implementation is only 12 lines of code long.  That's what makes it uncontroversial, easy to understand and approve without a long process, and can easily be done safely since transactions specifically have to opt-in to even use it.

He is an early investor and promoter of Bitcoin that often makes emotional appeals.  He became unhappy with the block size limitation, pushing aside valid technical arguments on the potential problems with on-chain scaling and used his significant clout and money to try at first to influence the direction of Bitcoin development and later to start promoting a Bitcoin fork called Bitcoin Cash and later trying to cast that as "the real Bitcoin".  
The reason he's controversial is because he owns bitcoin.com and uses that and other outlets and resources to try to conflate and re-define the fork and Bitcoin itself.  He's taken to renaming Bitcoin to "Bitcoin Core" on his website and at one point calling Bitcoin Cash bitcoin.  
Imagine if you were a new user trying to understand the difference between Bitcoin Cash (the fork) and Bitcoin and suddenly bitcoin.com uses a different name than the rest of the ecosystem and pushes an agenda that the fork is an "upgrade" despite the fact that the main community and ecosystem is far larger with the original coin.  It's frustrating for supporters of Bitcoin because the confusion could mean less adoption and also cause new users to buy the fork coin controlled essentially by Ver and a few others.

Here is my letter to the IRS:
I'd like to comment publicly on the recent IRS notice IR-2014-36 from March 25, 2014 regarding virtual currencies where it is described that "For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property". 
That goes against the very idea of what Bitcoin was intended to do, be a "currency".  The agency in this notice has even defined this class of financial instrument as "virtual currency", but is instead paradoxically treating it as property.
Please imagine for a moment that a dollar or other fiat currency was given this same treatment.  Every time a person went to make any transaction, it would possibly mean a taxable event, creating a nightmare of paperwork and requiring the person to keep track of every single purchase and later report it on tax forms.  It is not reasonable to expect record keeping for every transaction someone might make at the store using U.S. dollars, and having that be a taxable event for the person. 
Bitcoin was designed to be used and spent in the same way a dollar would be, except in an even more efficient manner.  Though it may not currently be as good as U.S. dollars as a a store of value, it is much better than U.S. dollars as a medium of exchange because it can be more efficiently transferred, done at a significantly lower cost and greater speed, and holds enormous potential for future financial innovation, cutting costs for consumers and business, and improving our lives.  One such example of a future innovation is crowd-funding, or cooperative funding of community projects.
It is important to apply a sane tax policy so as not to stifle this new innovation, and I consider treating it as property as unreasonable for most cases, except possibly when investors are using the virtual currency as a type of commodity investment (like gold) and not as a currency.
The interpretation in this notice of virtual currency as property will impose a tax regime on Bitcoin and other similar virtual currencies will have a stifling effect on the adoption of this innovative virtual currency technology and all the benefits it can bring.  Bringing virtual currencies into a tax regime is an important and worthy goal, but treating it as property for tax purposes is overly burdensome and should be reconsidered.

@_date: 2014-03-28 21:56:52
Yeah, but sales tax is required generally only on the merchant end, not the customer end.  Not only that, but the tax is a static percentage which is easy to calculate.  In the latest guidance from the IRS, the tax on virtual currencies depends on what price you bought at, so you have to do a lot more extensive tracking that isn't required even by merchants under the current sales tax regime.

"Currently you cannot accept more than 684 pledges for your project. This is due to limitations in the Bitcoin protocol - the final contract that claims the pledges is a single Bitcoin transaction, and thus is limited to 500 kilobytes by the Bitcoin block size and protocol relay rules. Lighthouse therefore enforces a minimum pledge size of whatever the goal amount is, divided by the max number of pledges. The more you try and raise, the larger the minimum buy-in becomes.
"A future version of Lighthouse could optimise its usage of transaction space to bump up the maximum number of pledges by another few hundred. But ultimately, the fundamental limit is imposed by the Bitcoin block size. There are plans to raise this from its current one megabyte cap, but it will take some time for this change to occur. Once it does, Lighthouse will be updated to allow more pledges.
"This doesn't have to be a big problem - Lighthouse is best used conservatively. It's not meant for raising a million dollars to go to the moon. Because projects are easy and free to create, you can structure your project in stages with each project funding the next stage of the project. This keeps risk for backers low.
"Note that in theory, the minimum pledge size could be dynamic (the money still left to be raised divided by however many slots are still available). But this would mean that a large early pledge that was later revoked could leave you with an unclaimable project, because you would need to find someone else willing to make a single pledge just as large. For simplicity therefore, Lighthouse enforces a minimum pledge size that still works even if everyone uses it."

As Gregory Maxwell said in the scaling roadmap, "Since Bitcoin is an electronic cash, it _isn't_ a generic database; the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is unbounded, and Bitcoin cannot and will not satisfy that demand for non-ecash (non-Bitcoin) usage, and there is no shame in that. Fortunately, Bitcoin can interoperate with other systems that address other applications, and--with luck and hard work--the Bitcoin system can and will satisfy the world's demand for electronic cash."

Nobody has figured out how to make such a thing.  If you had a million payments for coffee cup on a main chain, that would mean a very high external cost to be born by full nodes, to the point that most people couldn't afford to run full nodes and they become centralized.  One of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized, so you would lose that property.  If we had a good way to keep costs to a minimum while scaling this large on chain, that would be a tremendous technical breakthrough.  I hope that someone does figure out a way to make blockchains do that, but nobody has yet.

One major thing that helped the Internet early on was that congress passed a law making so states couldn't burden sellers with making them collect sales tax for people that buy from them online.  
We need something similar for Bitcoin, because right now if you want to do a bitcoin business it's looking like you might have to go state-by-state and license, and extremely expensive process that stifles competition because only the big players can do it.
The thinking behind the 1998 bill was to give the Internet room to grow, and not hurt it with onerous laws early on.  Similarly, bitcoin could benefit from such a thing.
What would also be helpful is if we had a bill so the IRS wouldn't treat it as property which may require tracking capital gains and losses every time you make a small purchase, a tax nightmare.
So a "hands off" bill, keeping state agencies from regulating it, and keeping the IRS rules to an absolute minimum to give the tech time to grow up, much like e-commerce was given, would be the most beneficial thing.

Not only that, but treating "Bitcoin Core" as some kind of formal structure with formal members is also completely wrong.  There is nobody who can even speak for "Bitcoin Core".  
Even the maintainer wladimir van der laan is not the voice of Bitcoin Core.  This is a hard concept for many people who are not a part of the open source movement to understand since they are so used to the idea of one or more people "being in charge".
Core developers aren't chosen or elected or special because they may or may not have commit access.  Anyone can contribute to Core.  If the contributions are valuable, others will look at them, test them, and if enough other people who work on Core are convinced about the merits of the contribution, a loose consensus of people who work regularly as volunteers on the project will endorse it and as a housekeeping task, the maintainer will merge the contributions to the master branch, at which point, any random person just found themself "added to Core" as a contributor.  
Core developers have no special authority, they can't even convince people to run their code.  Users have to choose to run it.  Or they can make their own version that doesn't follow any of those rules.
It is fundamental to understand this!

SPV works pretty well for many use cases and the security has been pretty good in practice.  However, what the parent post might have been referring to is the fact that "SPV/BIP 37 clients can leak quite a lot of user information including a probabilistic list of the user’s addresses, which can be used to derive an approximate transaction history."
It could also be related to the fact that "full nodes compute different results for each client user, which can be a significant computational burden if a full node is serving many mobile clients." 
SPV is still great in many cases but for other cases neutrino might be a better option, which is what this post is primarily about, especially for something like lightning "if different peers return conflicting filters, the Neutrino client can locate the conflicting block (using the filter header chain), then download the full block. With the full block, the client can automatically determine which peer was correct. BIP 37/SPV clients can alert the user when there are conflicts, but cannot automatically resolve them"
Also, I think you make an invalid assumption when you suggest that a 51% attack is unlikely to happen because more money would be made by attacking full nodes because there could be other motivations--like getting SPV clients to unwittingly follow a new new set of consensus rules, like what miners could have done when they wanted to hard fork to Bitcoin2X.

Probably because Bitmain's supported pools have been using ASICBoost, a technique that lets them bypass some of the proof of work.  This technique that was not known about until a few months ago, and could confer to them a secret advantage.  Even a small advantage can make a big difference in profitability, and thus viability as a company.  
When KnC Miner went out of business, they were unaware at the time of ASICBoost and the the CEO said this on November 20, 2016:

Logic would dictate that this is already factored into the price since it's been known for a while that segwit would activate.  But who knows, maybe euphoria will ensue once it actually happens, or the opposite, people cashing out on expectation of euphoria.
What this means is that in about 15 to 16 hours, segwit will lock-in irreversibly.  It mostly was irreversible anyway due to an agreement among miners (BIP-91).

The danger being fewer full nodes and the p2p network being more prone to censorship and disruption.
If you can't acknowledge that hard forks are more risky than soft forks, then I have no interest in continuing this conversation.
Look, I have no dog in this fight other than I want bitcoin to grow and work well for many people.  I too am troubled by higher fees and full blocks.  I'm not opposed to increasing block size.  But I do see risks after ethereum's hardfork splitting their coin, and I see risk in the decreasing decentralization of the p2p network.  I run a full node, and my costs are already pretty high, to the point that I question whether it's worth it or not.
I'm not here to make a religious argument.  I genuinely want what's best for bitcoin.  I have a hard time understanding why people want to hold back a solution that's ready now.  Yes, segwit enables lightning, but it also enables some immediate scaling, and it's modest enough that I don't think it has high risk.  Also, it will provide a good opportunity to see how full node operators react when costs go up and size increases.  If it's not bad, then I will be upset if further scaling solutions, including increasing blocksize is not in the cards.  But I also understand the importance of a fee market given the decreasing block subsidy over time. 
I don't think segwit is a waste, there are many other good things I'm very happy about with it, such as solving transaction malleability.  And lightning is far from the only use-case that segwit enables.  It allows for all kinds of interesting things that could help alleviate problems associated with scale.
Thanks for having this discussion, I'll try to keep an open mind as I hope you would.

Nobody is saying that there isn't a transaction backlog.  Remember, the scaling roadmap says "the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is unbounded".  But we can't scale bitcoin in an unbounded way without serious trade-offs.
We would all love for the network to process thousands of transactions per second without any trade-offs, but at present, that is not possible.  Simply increasing blocksize creates a problem known as "cost externalizing", which is is a term describing how one party maximizes its profits by off-loading indirect costs and forcing negative effects to a third party.  If the block size is increased, the party that maximizes its profits are the people creating transactions because with a higher block size they don't have to pay as much in fees, and the third party having their costs increased are those running full nodes.  If those costs increase, the number of nodes will drop, causing the network to be insecure.
Also, the economics of the bitcoin system require that a fee market develop over time as the block subsidy decreases.  Without a fee market, there would be no incentive to mine and secure the network.

It depends on what you value.  The dollar has experienced times of high inflation, and the system is also based on fractional reserves so your money in the bank isn't always 100% safe.  It's also subject to control by the federal reserve or seizure.  It's not easy to use internationally while retaining low fees.  The U.S. is also deficit spending to a high degree, your dollars could lose value rapidly if the market loses confidence in debt repayment by the government.  It's inherently inflationary as a currency where bitcoin is deflationary.  Bitcoin is programmable money, it will increasingly open new use cases for money that were never possible with the dollar.  We have just begun to explore the possible uses for it that go far beyond use as just a medium of exchange that you have highlighted.  Bitcoin not be superior to dollars for your particular use cases right now but Bitcoin is still in it's infancy with a lot of future promise.


Not true.  Again you are only looking at the medium of exchange use case.  It has value as a deflationary store of value that already exceeds the value of many other currencies and commodities.  And it's ability to be used in a wide variety of future programmable use cases can't be overstated.

A view that in the long-term BTC price will go up.  Admittedly, not a foregone conclusion but in my view, likely.
@_date: 2016-11-24 04:28:33
Your money isn't lost, it just hasn't been confirmed by the network because the fee you paid wasn't high enough.  Since there is limited space in each block, the transactions that get confirmed by miners are the ones with the highest fees, and the other transactions never get confirmed and eventually get dropped.  
Essentially that means there is a "fee market" and there is competition to get each transaction recorded, so there is a kind of auction to ensure your transaction will get confirmed.  Since there are more transactions happening on the network lately and blocks are full, you have to ensure you are paying enough in fees to have your transaction confirmed.
You can find a fee estimator here: 
Currently, if you want to get confirmed right away, you need a fee of around 91-100 satoshi's per byte or more.  Your 31 BTC transaction had a fee of 0.0001 BTC, and the transaction size was 817 bytes.  That means you were only bidding about 12 satoshi's per byte, not nearly enough.  Your fee should have been about 8 times higher.
I'm not sure how the Trezor wallet works, but your money isn't lost.  Your transactions at that fee rate won't confirm, and they will eventually drop from the nodes.  Your wallet should eventually show the amount back there.  If not, I imagine you should contact Trezor support.  But rest assured your money is not lost.

That's your problem right there, you're saying this "tweet" doesn't accurately provide any detailed explanation.  This is twitter we're talking about.  You shouldn't expect any kind of nuance or detail whatsoever.  These things have been addressed in detail countless times in other places, which is why I'm sure in a 160 character tweet it's not going to be re-stated.


Stop right there.  Out of the dozens of developers who have contributed to Core, and continue to contribute, only a small number of them are even part of Blockstream.  The primary maintainer is not part of Blockstream.  Neither is Eric Lombrozo, the core contributor sending this tweet.


As has been stated countless times, everyone would love for Bitcoin to be able to scale arbitrarily high, but safe engineering principles say that the blockchain is an extremely inefficient mechanism, and the more you increase the size, the more risk of both node centralization and mining centralization.  The exact engineering mechanics of why that creates centralization pressure has been explained many times in detail, so when someone makes the argument that some boogeyman "Blockstream" wants to hold it back without acknowledging the engineering concerns that the vast majority of engineers have with a dumb linear block size increase, it's seen as disingenuous.  If you really think that Blockstream is the one holding this back, how can you explain the fact that many, many independent engineers with no ties to Blockstream have the exact same concerns?  As a small example, Nick Szabo invented most of the concepts and tech that ultimately became Bitcoin, and he also [believes that the block size must be limited to preserve the all-important thing that makes Bitcoin special: it's decentralization](  He's just one of many other independent engineers that could be named.


You could argue that a small block size increase wouldn't hurt but in a system like Bitcoin, you've got to get to consensus or you risk splintering the community and possibly causing a lot of problems.  Satoshi hinted at this when saying alternate implementations could pose a menace to the system because getting to exact consensus by everyone all the time is paramount.  Even if the Blockstream engineers favored dumb scaling, there are many other engineers who still don't, but not because they have some ulterior motive, but because dumb linear block size scaling can harm a key property of the system.  The solution is to find new engineering solutions to scale in smarter ways (of which there are even some already on the scaling roadmap), and some that will start being effective as they are implemented (segwit/lightning, etc).
Having already made the case above that many engineers with nothing to do with Blockstream also think dumb linear scaling is not a good idea while there are other ways to attempt to scale and possible new engineering techniques to scale before such dumb scaling would be required, it's bordering on malicious to say that Blockstream is the one holding scaling back so they can profit.


This is easily debunked with the Blockstream Patent Pledge:   Also, some of the parties pushing for the hard fork have made their own patents with ASICBoost that could definitely harm decentralization by pushing out other players that couldn't take advantage of the same shortcut to proof of work.


There are virtually no engineers that believe the block size can scale to the heights needed to serve all use cases without having some trade-offs on the key property of decentralization.  Some people just happen to not care as much about users running full nodes or decentralization, which ironically could prevent the same people from trying to make changes without broader user consensus.

You have to remember a reality about the system--blockchain is a very scarce and very inefficient resource, and the demand for a spot on the most secure blockchain is unbounded.  The economics of the system are changed if you simply linearly increase the blocksize as well because it externalizes the cost of verification, bandwidth, and storage to full node operators.  It is a trade-off, and not a smart one by the reckoning of several of the leading blockchain engineering experts.  The currency will always be able to go up rapidly and be unpredictable on verification by nature due to the system design, even if there had been a dumb block size increase.  That's the nature of the system design.  Most core devs were not opposed to block size increase.  Take for example bip 103 where Peter Wiulle, a core dev proposes increasing it.  Or bip 105, another core dev btcdrak proposing a block size increase.  Most developers acknowledge that some level of block size increase may be needed.  Most of those plans got put on hold when it was discovered that there was a way to increase blocksize without having to hard fork (segwit), appeasing some opposed to hardforks, while also getting an increase.  Inexplicably, some miners blocked this proposal, despite it also enabling other use cases, perhaps because it disallowed a proof of work shortcut that wasn't known ahead of time (covert ASICboost).  
Long story short, technical consensus is an important proprety to bitcoin.  That didn't exist for a linear block size increase despite many core devs proposing and supporting some type of block size increase since there were better methods discovered for increasing transaction throughput in a more long-term scaleable fashion (segwit, for example).

It's not a difference of opinion, as not liking a hat would be.  I think there are objective reasons why hard forks are more dangerous.

Are you opposed to segwit for some reason?  It's a scaling solution that's ready to go now, at relatively low risk, and it's well tested.  I'm not opposed to raising the blocksize limit as well; but it's going to take quite a bit of doing because every full node will need to upgrade, which will take quite a while to do safely, and there isn't active code that's been well tested and ready to deploy.  We all know the risks of a hardfork gone bad with the recent ethereum hardforks, we need to take extra special care to avoid that.  Also, we need more studies into how much increasing the block size will reduce the resiliency of the full node network.
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:26:04

@_date: 2016-11-24 13:04:17
Yes.  Although you can make a pretty good educated guess with software by analyzing the current mempool and recent transactions.  Bitcoin has always had this property from the beginning; there has never been a guarantee of transaction confirmation, only a probability of confirmation.  Some miners even choose to ignore certain transactions even with high fees.  A lot of this can be solved with higher-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network, where confirmation is essentially instantaneous and requires virtually no fee.  Do you have a better idea?
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:19:16
RBF and CPFP aren't solutions to fees being high, they are just solutions to paying a fee that is too low and having transactions getting stuck.  The cost of bitcoin transactions is inherently high and has been since the very early days of bitcoin, averaging somewhere between $5 USD to $10 USD per transaction.  Right now, the costs are largely being born through the block subsidy: increases in supply.  But those are already scheduled to decrease and go away in time.  Without a healthy fee market developing over time, proper incentives won't be in place to continue securing the network right?
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:10:13

For security, you are in charge of your own security rather than outsourcing it by default like you do when you store your money with a bank.  It's as secure as you want to make it, and you could always choose to have your money stored or insured by using a third party if you wanted like you do with banks.
With regard to changing value, it's meant to have a fixed supply and be deflationary, but that doesn't mean in the future you can't use a pegged currency if you value that, while using bitcoin as a form of transmission, or some other exotic smart contract if you want to achieve price stability.  Having said that, volatility is of price decreasing over time and it may get to a point of much greater stability where it can be used in cases demanding price stability.  Bright future ahead.

Which is why bitcoin core now includes RBF (replace-by-fee) so if your transaction is not confirming, you can replace the transaction you've sent with a newer version that includes a higher fee to get it to go through.  Another option is to have the child pay for the parent with a higher fee.

That's true, it does have lower transaction fees, but if Bitcoin had the same transaction volume as BCH then it would also have lower transaction fees.  The real test will be if transaction volume picks up.  What happens when it reaches it's max blocksize?  The resource draw on full nodes will be enormous (**far, far more than 4X**) and mining centralization pressure much worse.  And then as fees rise, then what will they do?  Increase blocksize again?  This scaling simply won't bring any coin into the future we'd like them to have to replace legacy centralized systems like paypal or visa or banks.  This is why we need new solutions, sharding, or sidechains, or payment channel schemes like lightening and the like, or more research and computer science breakthroughs (which do happen quite often in this space).  We just need the patience not to destroy the coin now for dumb scaling today.  That is the key differentiator between BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:37:58
Also, regarding spam, I agree.  It's like the concept of one man's trash is another man's treasure.  Bitcoin has to be able to deal with someone being willing to load the network with high volume for whatever reason and Bitcoin must continue to function, even if that high value truly is "spam", or worthless transactions by someone with the money to waste.  
This is why off-chain transactions for cheap, like lightning transaction, are so important.  The cost of on-chain will always be subject to real world conditions that, like weather, could include unpredictable storms of high volume.  Since the scaling roadmap points out that "the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is unbounded", and there is a big trade-off for large blocks, we should continue to push toward off-chain applications such as lightning that are anchored on the network and settled there in case of a dispute.

We encourage others to join us in adopting it and making their patents freely available to anyone else who commits to its goals."
Many players in the space will not make a similar pledge to help open source and Bitcoin like Blockstream does.  
And even better, what Blockstream builds is completely optional for you to run.  Don't forget, the concept of a lightning network was invented by people that wanted to freely contribute to the community, it's invention was not even done by Blockstream.

what do you think is a good long term scaling solution?  I think sharding/sidechains/drivechains or something with different security assumptions for the smaller, everyday transactions that could also turn out to be great solutions, and more transactions with combined signatures with the Schnorr scheme and something like join market.

Litecoin is mostly a copy of Bitcoin with a few different technical parameters and a different mining algorithm.  Bitcoin is the ecosystem with the network effects, wide usage and adoption, and where the bulk of the development happens.  Litecoin borrows most of it's technology from Bitcoin and when new Bitcoin releases happen, the Litecoin developers take that code and apply it to Litecoin.

Why do you say "feigning willingness"?  It's almost as if you think he is not willing.
I think Adam Back is probably not opposed to increasing block size.  However, he is not a developer that actively works on the protocol.  Getting changes in Bitcoin involve making proposals, writing code, and getting technical consensus.  While he's a prolific voice, it's only one opinion.  Pieter Wuille also proposed one.
The core developers aren't necessarily against an increase from my reading of what several of them have said, but while there are still other options to exhaust that are less damaging to the decentralized nature, they'd like to exhaust those options first, which they have been doing.  There have been some excellent developments over the least few years.  Look at the major improvements in just two years on how fast the client is at validation (core developers increased speed over 7X since 0.12), the capacity increase with segwit, etc.  And work is moving forward on MAST, Schnorr, etc.  Not to mention the exciting breakthrough just published with confidential transactions.

What is the expected use case for this?  If someone wants to pay you Bitcoin, you or they will still need an upstream connection to nodes to actually send the transaction, so if you're in a place where you are censored and you need to use satellite, wouldn't the upstream be censored as well? 
Or if the use case is you are in a remote location, won't the person paying you be similarly hampered by being in that remote location and both will be unable to broadcast the transaction for processing.

increasing on-chain transaction capability will demand virtually an exponential increase in resources required to run a node, that's the problem with it.  Core did just increase it recently with segwit, and will increase it again with MAST and Schnorr (and increase privacy to boot).  As a last resort, many core developers have even proposed simple on-chain scaling (like Peter Wuille's BIP 103 where he said "Many people want to see Bitcoin scale over time, allowing an increasing number of transactions on the block chain. It would come at an increased cost for the ecosystem (bandwidth, processing, and storage for relay nodes, as well as an impact on propagation speed of blocks on the network), but technology also improves over time. When all technologies depended on have improved as well as their availability on the market, there is no reason why Bitcoin's fundamental transaction rate cannot improve proportionally." and proposed an on-chain solution). 
The point is though that there are smarter scaling solutions that can happen now and many being worked on such that we don't need to resort to the least effective method possible yet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:46:05
When you have a $100 billion system with the most transaction volume of any coin, all dependent on solid, reliable code, you see how important it becomes to have mature technology implementation.  Very few software projects have the security requirements that Bitcoin has.

I would argue the main reason is because it lacks stable store of value properties; you don't want to do primary spending with a currency that buys you different amounts of things each day or depending on when you buy.  Over time it's becoming less volatile, but it's still risky to have much money in it that you need for stable store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:25:56
And how do you suggest "core" does that without hurting decentralization and raising external costs on the nodes that secure the network?
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:14:45
Some of them, but it also has to do many other things if you read it.
For example, another is philosophy.  Everyone wants scale. If simply increasing blocksize would solve all the scaling issues we probably wouldn't even be having this debate.  The main issue is that one side wants better engineering to mitigate the negative effects of simple block increases ("smarter scaling"), the other side wants scale even at the expense of decentralization.  
Network effects and acceptance is also not related to developers.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:29:17
Nobody, including the developers think it will be fine without scalability.  Go look at the original scaling roadmap if you believe otherwise.  That roadmap was signed by all the major Bitcoin developers.
"TL;DR:  I propose we work immediately towards the segwit 4MB block
soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable."
That was almost two years ago.  Since then, many of this has been done.  The work on validation and p2p speed-up has been incredible.  They have been laying the groundwork for bandwidth increases (block size increase).  
There are more on the horizon being worked on right now that can also make a big difference, like Schnorr.

It's inflationary, but at a decreasing rate, such that eventually the inflation is a low percentage of total coin issuance, kinda like Bitcoin today.  The only difference is Bitcoin has an eventual cap in 100 or so years but in several years, Grin's inflation would be so negligible as to not matter much either.

Anywhere you spend money, (like a store), will almost always take that money straight to the bank at the end of each day where it gets put in the bank machine watching serial numbers.  If you have money that is being tracked, they know exactly when and where you spent it.  With only a little bit of statistical analysis, it should be easy to track you down or at least easily view a pattern of what you do with your money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:56:36


Yes, Bitcoin has a scaling problem in that it can't have more than x transactions.  That's a different kind of scaling problem than what I was describing, but you're right that BTC can't scale right now on-chain.  
The scaling problem I was addressing is that if you have the kind of problem where suddenly the p2p network can't handle the traffic anymore, the full nodes stop working on normal computers, and all small miners are forced out, there's no fixing that, you've probably permanently broken your coin.
But you're right that BTC can't scale right now on-chain... well, it can to some degree as people move to segwit, and more improvements are on the way, but legacy transactions are nearing a ceiling.

That is what is so exciting to me about this and Schnorr, that it makes it cheaper to aggregate transactions that at the same time significantly improves privacy.  With CT we have amount privacy, and with coinjoin/valueshuffle, we have transaction graph obscuring.  And it makes the obscuring in coinjoin/valueshuffle much better because you can't try to observe amounts to de-anonymous the joined transaction.


In the announcement Greg said that you and several others are working on CPU overhead optimization based on libsecp256k1.  Is there any prediction of how much optimization you think might be possible?  The Bulletproofs innovation resulted in something like a 10X bandwidth/space optimization, would something like that be possible with CPU optimization?  I guess it's hard to speculate what you could discover.  You guys are doing amazing work.


But the great thing is that this is possible in Bitcoin!  Thank you for laying the groundwork.  We know there is still lots of engineering, testing, maturing and work ahead to get this to production-ready code and high standard Bitcoin requires.

Second, I think it's important to understand why this is important.  This explains why [
Third, Bitcoin was supposed to have some degree of anonymity from the start, but it turns out that with statistical analysis and other methods you can pretty easily de-anonymize everything.  This helps counteract some of that.

I think you're right, if the solid developer community around Bitcoin moved, or BCH somehow cultivated their own, and enough market and mindshare wanted to switch, anything is possible.  But the network effects make that highly unlikely.  But I'll grant you that anything is possible.  What is more likely to happen is Bitcoin will lead in new innovation for scaling that will have better options than "dumb" linear scaling.  In the long run, if there is no solution at all, then it can experience a decline.  But everyone wants a solution.  Nobody signed up for Bitcoin wanting it to be a niche project only.  Let's have patience, many things are in the works.

Using the Bitcoin blockchain for spam, such as what veriblock is doing is proof that one of the central assertions of the scaling roadmap is correct, that due to design of Bitcoin, block size cannot be simply raised indiscriminately.
In 2015, Gregory Maxwell said:
"Since Bitcoin is an electronic cash, it _isn't_ a generic database;
the demand for cheap highly-replicated perpetual storage is **unbounded**, and Bitcoin cannot and will not satisfy that demand for non-ecash (non-Bitcoin) usage, and there is no shame in that."
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:21:07
First of all, "core" did not sign the Hong Kong agreement last year, only individual developers did.  You seem to have a misunderstanding of what "core" is.  
As Gregory Maxwell stated "[Core] isn't a company.  Individuals have plans about their own work which they may collaborate in one place or another."  For something to be adopted into the core client, it has to reach some level of consensus and have demonstrated utility, safety features, proper testing, etc.
When you say "core" backed out, I don't think that's an accurate reading.  After the agreement was signed, one of the miners immediately started mining with an alt-client, even though the agrement said "We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future."


Again, "core" can't cancel the agreement since "core" did not sign it.  The agreement says: 
"We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit"
The agreement doesn't say it will be implemented in core (since developers cannot force something into core), but that they will have a recommendation available. 
They did release a bip proposal and reference code for the hard fork:

Signaling without action doesn't have any teeth.  And if you don't run it long before the date, the miners would have no reason to think anything would change since only a small portion of the network looks like it's actually following the UASF rules.

Except that there was a recent discovery that miners might have a perverse and previously unknown incentive to block some types of improvements because of a shortcut they found where they don't have to do as much proof of work.  They might not be using it, but it would explain why they are against several recent improvement proposals.

That would be a hard fork with all the accompanying risks and requiring virtually all nodes and miners to upgrade.  There are probably other risks as well to this that make it worse than a 2 MB hard fork.  Segwit was a compromise fix that was intended to fix several bugs while at the same time providing a transaction throughput increase while being done through a safer mechanism that was backwards compatible (soft fork) unlike hard forks.

In an ideal world, you could launch a fund like this without the SEC in the first place.  If there were such a free market, and low barriers of entry for creating such funds, then it would make sense to just "let the free market decide".  However, that's not the case.
The SEC limits choice severely by making the approval process very difficult and costly, and once one fund gets the lion's share of investment, it's likely that a business case that should exist in a free market won't be able to emerge because the minor difference in fine print won't be enough to overcome the costs of the SEC barriers of entry when doing break-even analysis on creating another fund.
That means the ecosystem might have at it's lead a fund that has undue control over a large part of the funds and which forks are favored, a big anathema to the open ethos.

Not only are your deposits unsecured liabilities, we know for a fact that the bank is only holding a fraction of your money in reserve.  If there is a run on the bank or too many people try to withdraw, mathematically there is not enough money for everyone due to the money multiplier and fractional reserve banking the whole system runs on.  
This is why in a banking crisis the federal reserve and congress will do whatever possible to try to stabilize the system to keep too many people from panicking and withdrawing; the system literally would fall apart if everyone withdrew.
The government does have a lot of tools at it's disposal though, we saw some of them come out during the 2008 crisis.  But as the debt-to-GDP ratio in the U.S. continues to climb, the risks increase that traditional monetary and fiscal tools will no longer work in a crisis as confidence erodes and there is a non-zero risk that dollar purchasing power could take a serious hit.
In a future crisis, even the "safest" banks in the U.S. may limit your withdrawals or give you a haircut, or there could be massive inflation to erode the value of the dollar.  This is what happened in Greece, Argentina, etc.  There is nothing to say this can't happen in the U.S.

There's a reason why, when bugs are found, companies like people to privately disclose them, and give them as much time as possible to fix before releasing them publicly.  Yes, it's always possible to do a really quick fix and release quickly, and sometimes that is indeed required because of the severity and urgency of a given bug, but in most cases if the bug is not that type of extremely critical bug, it's better to put it through its paces and test it really well first like most development.  Otherwise you risk the quick-fix causing more problems or introducing new bugs.  
There is a long history of bugfixes actually creating new problems, so finding the right balance here is critical.  
BitcoinABC developers took a fix from Core that was written by Core and being reviewed to ensure the fix didn't break existing functionality, and quickly implemented it in their own BitcoinABC codebase, then wrote a statement that made it look like Core was incompetent and they were much better more competent, faster team without crediting Core for actually finding and fixing the bug, and making them look bad even though they were taking this slower, more prudent path.  It's a pretty shady maneuver.

What we also know is that miners have a history of signaling all kinds of things they aren't actually doing or end up changing their mind on and switching.  Many have also engaged in SPV mining, not even fully validating blocks.
As long as we the users continue to support Bitcoin and not another chain, miners will follow.  You only mine an unprofitable chain for so long.  My advice is to ask your exchanges to continue supporting Bitcoin and if they want a 2X chain that's fine, but call it 2x.  The majority of users and price support will be with Bitcoin and the core developers.  We'll show the miners that we run the show and they work for us.

The reason Coinbase is not on our side is because they "welcome regulation"... just like most large corporations, regulation is good for them because it creates barriers of entry for the smaller players who don't have huge amounts of funding for compliance in all 50 states and all federal regulators.  
I mean, Coinbase already employs 20% of it's very large workforce just for "compliance", so of course they want other people to have to pay those costs as well.  It keeps them in a nice incumbent position when regulation is created because they know they have the legal armies to comply where a small competitor wouldn't.  Most regulation is good for big business and bad for small business.

Gemini is only licensed in certain states.  So only one company, with an enormous valuation and many rounds of over a hundred million in funding really is working in the U.S. market.  Don't you see that enormous barrier of entry created by the regulation?  And you think that is not crippling?

These things are good in theory, but horrible in implementation and the barriers of compliance so high, that only large, very well funded banks and the like can even comply.
Imagine a nasty patchwork of regulations, one in every state, that's 50 potential regulators, all with their own unique requirements of bonding, insurance, quarterly reports, legal fees, etc. etc.  It's a paperwork nightmare, and liability and risk so high that virtually no one can play in the space.  This isn't about hiding anything, it's about the minimum level of compliance being out of reach for entrepreneurs.
We went most of the years of our country without such overburdensome regulation, and also patching in existing regulation into this new paradigm of cryptocurrencies is a horrible idea, but that's what's happening.

That's why this kind of centralized decision-making and these large powerful government bureaucracies are so terrible, we as citizens don't even get to vote for the commissioners, and they make decisions supposedly with public input but at the end of the day they can just choose to ignore it on their own slow and capricious decision-making process.

So essentially, if I understand this correctly, in the case that there appears suddenly out of the blue some quantum computer that breaks the current signature scheme, you can use your private key with a new signature scheme to move your coins, encrypt it, commit that encrypted version to the blockchain, then later release the public key.
At that point, it doesn't matter if someone could quickly find your private key from your public key because the only thing the private key can be used for is to confirm the already committed change.

Why are so many reddit titles so misleading?  Instead of an alarmist post about them not supporting addresses, you could have more calmly said "BitPay is now requiring the Payment Procotol (BIP 70) to reduce problems with people paying incorrect amounts or accidentally sending to the wrong address but unfortunately, many clients don't support it yet."
Bitpay says:


Having a good user experience with paying is important for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem because if users have a hard time paying, even with the refunds Bitpay does when users make a mistake, they aren't likely to continue to use Bitcoin at all.  I think it's good that Bitpay is at least trying to improve the payment experience, even if it's painful when your favorite wallet doesn't yet support BIP 70.
Bitpay themselves would like a better solution:


BIP 70 is not a *bad* solution, and by having a large player boldly support it, it encourages more wallets to integrate it.
**Are there better proposals than BIP 70 to help reduce so many user errors and man in the middle attacks with copying and pasting addresses?**
I would eventually like to see a payment protocol that also incorporates lightning for smaller payments with a fallback to a regular Bitcoin payment for larger amounts or cases where a route can't be found in lightning.  Does anyone know of anything like that?

It won't remain a minority chain if the users and buyers stick with Bitcoin.  Miners are already defecting.  Miners won't leave profits on the table for long on principle to stick with some third rate developer team that users won't support.
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:00:01
BitPay doesn't show the address anymore, and no, merchants can't turn it on anymore.  
This should be a lesson for user experience designers, which the Bitcoin ecosystem is in real need of.  BitPay has on a regular basis so many failed/underpaid/overpaid/bad fee situations that it was better to risk losing some users by requiring the BIP 70 payment protocol than it was to continue having so many poor payment experiences due to users paying wrong amounts or paying the wrong addresses.
That says something, and that's not BitPay's fault.  When you have a system with irreversible transactions, it's important to get things right.  BIP 70 is one of the best ways to handle that right now; it's just unfortunate that not many wallets support it yet.

Nobody likes artificial limits, but until better engineering makes more breakthroughs, the limit is probably needed for safety.  Fortunately, several known engineering techniques will provide upcoming scale such as MAST and Schnorr and we can see how layer 2 does.  Maybe the future could include sharding and the like while maintaining safety.  On-chain scalling just won't bring us to mainstream levels as constituted, we need ongoing computer science and engineering breakthroughs rather than linear scaling.

This is false, your money could be swept by a claim from an outside third party, or the government.  This has happened to me before.  Sure, I eventually got the money back after going to court and proving the third party claim was bogus, but that didn't stop them from taking my money and holding it hostage and making me go through the hassle of proving it was mine.
Not only that, but you can still lose some money if the bank goes bankrupt.  And the legal claims you supposedly have are no good if the loans the bank made end up being bad.  Sure, there's FDIC insurance but it only covers up to a certain amount.  And even though you discount a systemic risk, it is a real risk, no such counter-party risk exists with you holding your own Bitcoin.

What the New York regulators fail to understand is that this is about far more than compliance costs.  They see things through their lens of people using third party processors and can't understand the paradigm of people transacting peer to peer without third parties.  There are entire use cases of enormous innovation that can never come to pass due to onerous and over-burdensome legislation where people can transact peer-to-peer that won't happen while they think of one of those parties needing a high level of compliance.
A quick example, a company that wants to help facilitate pieces of peer to peer transactions without taking custody of funds shouldn't be regulated like traditional third party processors that risk hurting consumers due to holding custody.
There are so many more of these.

We need to fight and oppose these kinds of efforts wherever possible.  Cryptocurrency needs and space to grow before trying to squelch it with this kind of overly restrictive legislation and the nightmare that it is to try to get licensed in all 50 states.

Bitpay was having lots of problems with failed payments, underpaid payments, overpaid payments, or wrong fees.  This requires them to issue refunds and causes lots of support problems.  It was so bad they decided to make so the only way you could pay was by using the Bitcoin Payment Protocol, as specified in BIP 70.  That isn't a bad thing per se, it's the most widely implemented solution to instruct wallets in a mostly secure way which address to pay and how much.  The problem is that a lot of wallets still don't support this payment method yet, so a lot of people are having trouble paying with this method.
However, some people are upset at Bitpay for other reasons as well, such as the fact that they put the fees higher than they need to be or tell users that a good fee is too low on the Bitcoin network.  They show a lower fee for Bitcoin Cash than for Bitcoin.  Since Bitmain, the big miner who helped spearhead forking Bitcoin Cash in the first place is also a big investor in Bitpay, many people believe they are not fixing their fee estimator and user experience in order to push more people toward Bitpay, for which they have a possible conflict of interest due to their investor.

I think that's right.  It's not so much about Bitcoin Unlimited, but showing that they don't support Core.
For my education, where does "Core" deny the 1 MB limit was a temporary anti-spam measure?
By the way, for your education, I've been keeping track, and nearly every core developer has stated they think the chain will probably need to scale at some point, they are not hostile to on-chain scaling.  The reason they don't want to do it immediately is because:
1. Safety is paramount.  We all, including core, want Bitcoin to succeed and scale up, including on-chain scaling if necessary.  But given that any small vulnerability could potentially be catastrophic, possibly damaging Bitcoin beyond all repair, it's important that it be done safely.  If someone can demonstrate the safety of a proposed solution, it can be considered.
2. There are short-term scaling solutions that can be done more safely for the moment.  Some are already in place, such as libsecp256k1 which makes future scaling safer, increasing performance with stuff like ConnectTip performance, headers-first downloading, some improvements pending acceptance like segwit which increases block capacity, fixes malleability, reduces UTXO growth, and fixes the quadratic scaling of sighash problem.  After segwit, there are other great scaling options core wants to implement before on-chain scaling, including schnorr signatures, merkelized abstract syntax trees (which also increases privacy as well as scale)
3. There are other possible ways to scale that are also being investigated that might be safer than simply scaling on-chain such as extension blocks, sidechains, drivechains, etc.  There is also hope that more innovation and technology will be able to provide better scaling that could yield much larger increases.
4. Some models have already shown problems with safety and perverse miner incentives the larger the current chain scales.  We hope to avoid those with the above.
It's hard for me to understand why Bitcoin Unlimited supporters to justify why they don't support Segregated Witness and other planned safe scaling measures when they say they want scaling.  Core developers from what I can tell have all supported increases but for the reasons above, primarily safety, would rather do the other things first.

There are many ways we can scale without compromise, everyone on Core wants to find ways to scale transactions without compromising network integrity and decentralization.  We have some immediate things we can do such as Schnorr signatures, and longer-term things like sidechains, drivechains, mimblewimble, sharding, etc.  They need more work and research, but it's not worth compromising the long-term future of bitcoin for, we need to find the safest and most responsible way to scale.

The original Bitcoin whitepaper says:


It doesn't say anything about "cheap".  Sure, we all want cheap transactions, but there are limits to what can safely be done there while still solving the double spend problem keeping the network trustless, "not requiring a third party".  We can keep things cheap by using other layers, much like altcoins are cheap with less security, we can get cheaper transactions through payment channels, lightning network, sidechains, etc.  Segwit helps enable those possibilities.

I think it's unlikely there will be a split, but even if there is, your coins exist in both places, you would just need a wallet that could recognize both chains.  The most likely scenario is that either BIP-148 fails, and some users fork off, but if nobody follows the chain, nobody will use it, or if it succeeds, it will make so the legacy chain doesn't exist at all.  So I think the chance of a long-run fork are negligible, and even if it happens, your coins are safe on both chains.

Hasn't that also been true of segwit since it was released last November 2016?  At this point, segwit could be active in three weeks if miners just turn on one bit, and that's been true for almost a year.  How long would it take to do a hard fork where every wallet, client, exchange, etc. is required to upgrade?  All of that also would need full agreement among the entire ecosystem, much more than any soft fork (since it's not opt-in), and also, lots of testing.  That would realistically take another year probably.  Shouldn't we not hold the whole world to ransom and force them through a microscopic bottleneck?  At this point, the quickest scaling solution is the one already well tested and on the table, is it not?

Let's say you're the nuetral passenger and you want to increase the speed of the plane by just adding more powerful engines to the plane.  The engineers might tell you that you could push it a little bit, but if you do too much without better engineering and consideration of the entire architecture of the wings, materials, structure, design, and aerodynamics, you risk creating structural integrity problems via "dumb scaling" of the airplane speed.  It's not unreasonable for the passengers to want more speed, but it would be unwise to do so if the engineers have valid reasons for simply increasing one variable without considering constraints on the whole system.
As [Nick Szabo]( put it:
"There's a technical security parameter, it's called the "blocksize".  How the general public glombed onto this I do not know, but **there's an obsessive group of people who think of this as some kind of artificial barrier to more transactions per second on Bitcoin**.  Really, it's job is it's a fence preventing people from flooding the network with lots of transactions that the full nodes I talked about can't handle.  That transaction history keeps building and building
"This shouldn't even be a public debate.  **It's like a public debating and voting on the graphite reactor settings that prevent a nuclear reactor from overheating and shutting down.**  There are certain things you should let the engineers decide, and this is one of them.  For some reason there's this whole group of people that want to pull out the graphite moderator rods and let this run at full steam."
Fortunately, the smart engineers have come up with ways to increase the speed of the plane before we resort to the dumb linearly scaling increases that a simple block size increase would provide.  Those are outlined here: [

It takes 100 blocks before rewards can even be redeemed. Why would they risk mining on something that would take 100 days before they could even sell? When it's unsure the chain would even survive that long?"
If several exchanges list the chain, and it has sufficient buy orders, miners will mine with the expectation that they can cash out, the same underlying assumption we have today, other than the time frame might be longer for the first adjustment period.  
And given the fact that this is the chain already in use, not some new chain, I don't think we have to be worried about it suddenly dying because over 25 core developers have already stated they will not support Segwit2X.  Which coin would you invest in?  The one with the support of the best developer team, or one that some but not all exchanges have opted to support?
A similar thing happened with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, except that chain managed to survive even with the majority of the best developers moving to the new chain.  In this case, the best developers are sticking with the original chain.  So I would bet with a high likelihood that the old chain will achieve sufficient buy orders to make mining it compelling.

@_date: 2017-07-05 20:28:07
Don't mistake objecting to poor ideas with with being hard to work with.  As an engineer, I support his position in this case, and here's why:
Greg probably wouldn't want classic or BU because these were poorly engineered pieces of software, and more importantly, not elegant engineering solutions to the scaleability problem, especially when more elegant solutions existed to solve the same kinds of problems (like Segwit itself).
As far as UASF/BIP148, he doesn't object to UASF necessarily if it's done in a more safe way.  See this comment from him as an example:
And this from Greg on the mailing list:


Elsewhere he has said that he *might* be willing to consider BIP-148 if there is overwhelming support from it across the ecosystem, but that doesn't appear to be the case.
BIP 141 had a 95% activation mechanism (BIP 9) because that was a mechanism that worked well for prior soft fork deployments, and is considered safe.  BIP 141 showed us though that miners can object and veto based on inexplicable reasons.  It could be ASICBoost.  It could be they want to have more control.  It could be they want other developers to be in charge.  It could be they want to have a "central planning committee".  It could be they want to hold that upgrade "hostage" to force their desire for a larger block size hard fork.  They haven't explained any valid technical objection to not signaling for segwit, so we are left to speculate as to why such a powerful and well-tested upgrade hasn't yet received sufficient support.  And anyway, Greg is not opposed to changing the deploy mechanism if 95% is not achieved.  He cited BIP-149 as an example of the kind of thing that could be done to have a path forward with less disruption than BIP 148 because it's not coercive by orphaning blocks and doesn't require miners to upgrade.  The only thing they can't do is mine segwit-invalid transactions, which have to be crafted in a malicious way.
As far as not supporting Segwit2X, how many of all the core developers support that?  I count 25 core developers against it!  And don't forget Satoshi himself said "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network."  Greg has worked hard to ensure nodes get those identical results and we avoid contentious scenarios like Segwit2X or other clients might create.  Bitcoin is hard to change, and that's by design.  Greg would love to get BIP 141 segwit, as would all of us, but he emphasizes the need to do it safely.
This is why I think you are unjustified in thinking he is hard to work with just because he wants to ensure that upgrades are good technical solutions, minimize disruption, and respect an open community process.

So why not do segwit now (since that solution is ready now), then if it's not enough in a few months as you say, we do a hard fork at that time?  Something might be invented in the intervening time that also finds a better way to solve the problem of the security and scaleability trade-off.

@_date: 2017-07-18 07:39:51
You are misinformed.
Almost every core developer has at one time or another made a proposal for a block size increase.  Adam Back made a 2-4-8 proposal.  Peter Wuille proposed a 17% per year increase of block size.  btcdrak proposed a miner vote to increase or decrease blocksize by a maximum of 10% every 2016 blocks.  Even luke-jr has made proposals to increase blocksize when necessary.  
When scaling was becoming a problem, many core developers put out ideas on how to scale.  Concerns revolved around the difficulties and problems of hard forking, and the fact that it can cause problems for partitioning/DOS attacks, externalized costs, and only scaling linearly.  Then it was discovered that there was a way to fix a long-standing bug, solve several other issues, encourage use of transactions that reduce UTXO bloat, and roughly double scale, AND do all of this with a soft fork, making it completely opt-in!  And all of this could be done together with a rather elegant solution that would set up future scaling options such as being able to do new signature types like Schnorr in the future.  It was such an elegant solution that not only relieved some scaling pressure, it also solved all of those things, so developer consensus quickly formed around it.  This solution is called "segwit".  Even developers considered in the "large block" camp seemed happy with it, like Gavin Andresen [(source)](  
When this was discovered, developers were pretty excited about it, and Greg Maxwell wrote the [core roadmap]( that over 50 bitcoin developers signed.  That roadmap defined many improvements that could be made to scaling, including segwit, more efficient block relay, cut-through, bidirectional payment channels (lightning, etc. that are enabled via segwit).  There are even others that could help both scale and privacy that segwit could enable like Schnorr signatures, which are amazing scaling improvements.  And the great thing about all of these things is that they weren't just theoretical, but already based on provable technology that just needed engineering.  But even this core roadmap opens the possibility and desire for something like flex caps or incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls, and also "at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."
So you are completely misinformed that developers are against a block size increase.  What they are against is dumb block size increases as a method to scale when we already have so many good ways to scale, test, and continue to scale that don't require us to compromise security of the network, increase external costs to node operators, or introduce other risks until we run out of known scaling improvements and must resort to a dumb linear block size increase that provides only linear scaling.
I kindly ask that you do not spread such misinformation again.

You're looking at it with a lot of hindsight.. there was a ton of turmoil for a long period of time.  And the chain that has the most developer support is the one that emerged with the biggest market cap.  I think the same will be true here.


I agree.  I'm fine with the NY Agreement people forking off as they're planning to do in three months and seeing if the market wants their coin.  I think those that don't offer Bitcoin supported by the core developers will see a mass exodus of users.  I know I will delete my accounts at any exchanges that attempt this.


I'm not talking about UASF, I'm talking about the hard fork.  Bip-148 is not supported by a majority of core developers either and many consider it unsafe just as they do the proposed hard fork.


Miners go to coins where they are profitable, and that movement tends to be fairly elastic.  If you watch the other coins, the minute there is a significant swing in the market price, you can watch the miners switch coins pretty regularly to where any coin that has some decent depth to it will see a pretty quick adjustment in the number of miners.  You rarely see a coin with decent depth that gets higher profit ratio vs. BTC because the minute they become more profitable, miners switch, making things reach equilibrium, tending toward a 100% profit ratio to BTC.  It's quite an elastic effect.

Depending on how these are structured, it could be done in a way that doesn't require validation from all the Bitcoin nodes, and therefore has less security, but has lower fees and alternate properties that might be desirable.  They could be made opt-in, but still transferrable with regular Bitcoin, so it doesn't force additional external costs on all Bitcoin node operators.

@_date: 2017-07-24 07:23:17
A hard fork really should only be undertaken with 99.5% or more of the community because if a user doesn't agree, they are on a different chain.  It's a severe break of the rules.  Enough users are around that don't want it until we have some hard evidence about scaling from segwit, a safe way to do it, and the absolute need for it since no other options are available.  None of those are true yet, so we shouldn't do it yet.

Totally wrong, unless you wanted to orphan the majority of the network.  Based on how long we've seen it take for various parties in the ecosystem to upgrade, it could take a minimum of six months to a year for every implementation to test and patch.

Jeff is competent and I like him.

Why does Jeff get to decide, along with his corporate sponsors what things get to go in, instead of a community consensus process?
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:07:17
Because the Chinese miners wanted a seat at the table to influence the protocol and decisions.  They were happy, for example, when Charlie Lee (founder of Litecoin) went to them and worked out a deal with them, then they started signaling segwit right away.  
They want Bitcoin to be managed the same way, by a committee.
Blocking segwit and allowing segwit2X was all about trying to get rid of the core developers.  That's been the miner goal.
["Segwit2X is about the miners getting rid of the Core developers... Jihan has told me this himself."](
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:55:58
I think miners are rational, in that they are looking out for their own self-interests, which may include some unspoken thing the rest of the community might find bad, such as ASICBoost, trying to get greater control over development, or trying to create leverage for their preferred solutions (bigger block size hard fork).
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:47:07
Jeff, just a simple and sincere question.  If Jihan *did* want segwit, why did he simply not signal for it for the last 8 months or so?  Why did he let the community get into such knots and debates if in the end he did want it and was just delaying for some inexplicable reason until a few months before timeout?
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:21:52
There is a high likelihood that if segwit/UASF/BIP-8-style flag day achieves the same level of client-side rollout that BIP 141 has achieved, that miners will upgrade as well due to the risk of mining an invalid chain in your scenario, or at the very least, they only need to upgrade border nodes to ensure invalid transactions don't reach the rest of their nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:55:05

Miners are largely irrelevant when it comes to hard forks.  And for a hard fork to be successful without splintering into two chains, they must be done with overwhelming user support.
Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Btc-e, Kraken, Gemini, Poloniex, Huobi, and OKCoin have not signed on to Segwit2x, and I will hazard a guess that virtually no nodes on the network will run it.  That's not nearly enough support, or time, to "upgrade" without splintering into two chains.

Jihan wants political control and wants to get rid of the core developers, according to Chris Kleeshulte from Bitpay who had Jihan tell him this: 
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:24:31
There is a proposal called Segregated Witness, (Segwit for short).  It fixes numerous bugs in a clever way and increases the number of transactions per block that can be processed to around double the current limit today.  
You can read more about it here, the most official source on it:
The way this segwit upgrade was written required miners to signal they were ready to enforce the segwit rules.
Some parties (miners) have been opposed to this segwit upgrade, and so they haven't signaled for it.  It was hard to tell why they opposed it since it's generally considered a pretty good fix to multiple problems, and a core developer discovered that the miner in question has a secret way of bypassing some of the work normally required to mine, gaining a monetary advantage.  This is called ASICBoost.  That advantage disappears with this new segwit upgrade, so suddenly the reason for the opposition and delays made sense.
Some people proposed a software update that would trigger segwit activation even if the miners don't signal for it.  There are numerous proposals for this, but one of them is BIP-148, which means that by August 1st, they will reject blocks that don't signal for segwit in an effort to coax all the miners into signaling for segwit, in effect activating segwit on the network for all the other non-upgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:06:41
According to current estimates, it would solve the congestion issue just as much as a 2 MB hard fork, if not solve it even better since current transaction volume would mean an effective increase with today's network usage pattern of over 2 MB.  So why do you think it would not solve the network congestion issue, but a "block size increase" would?
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:44:32
The thing is, we don't think he is being honest.  They've been blocking segwit inexplicably for a long time.  All kinds of explanations have been come up with in the past for maybe why it wasn't supported, such as, OK, maybe it's not his preferred scaling method, or maybe he's scared that lightning will take away miner fees, or maybe he is wanting to hold it hostage to get to 2 MB blocks, or maybe he doesn't like the current core team.  And now, he doesn't like the fee weight?  
The developers have even wondered about, OK what if we address these various concerns, will he go for it?  What if segwit only fix transaction malleability but didn't increase the block size, would that address the concerns?  But after trying to figure this out for months, when ASICBoost was discovered, it finally clicked why holding segwit back was so inexplicable, and why the miners would never really explain their real reason for blocking this improvement; meanwhile the community was trying to figure out what was so wrong about something that appeared to solve multiple problems in a relatively clean way.  
What is also becoming clear is Jihan seems to be using misdirection in order to stall this change.  It's finally time to do something about it.  I'm not sure if BIP-148 is the proper way or another UASF like BIP-149 or something else, but it is clear that Jihan is manipulating the community to stall progress.

You want to prevent a split?  That doesn't make any sense when you are the one proposing to literally split the coin in three months with a fork that the majority of users and developers won't support.


You are trying to fork without overwhelming support and call your new chain "Bitcoin".  That's pretty manipulative.


That's FUD.  Fees are not centrally planned.  If anything, the NYA looks like central planning by invite-only committee as opposed to the community-consensus development process.


We'll see in three months who is right.  I will continue to mine the original chain that has emphasis on safety and open process and run a node supported by the best developers in the industry.

Chainsplits put the exchanges in a difficult position.  They basically have three choices:
1. They can choose to list the new chain as a new trading pair, but then it's another whole infrastructure and associated costs and security risks they have to manage and customer confusion.  That's a lot of hassle and cost.  
2. They can choose to let users "withdraw" their coins on the alt-chain for sentimental reasons but not trade in them (this is what they did with Ethereum Classic ETC), which also causes customer confusion, but what almost inevitably happens with that is they in essence *encourage* their customers to sign up for a competitor exchange who will actually deal in the coin so they can make money, even if small.  Who doesn't want an extra few bucks for dumping a coin they don't care about anyway?  I'm sure when they offered ETC withdrawals (but not trading), customers immediately took them to a competitor exchange like Poloniex.  They can't be happy about that.
3. They can choose to do nothing, as Coinbase is saying they will do in this case.  To answer your question: who knows if they keep the coins for themselves, or just literally ignore the new chain.  The main downside with this option for the exchange is that some customers will inevitably complain that they aren't getting the full economic value they are due, as you are already implying with your post.  There could even be a legal consequence for not giving customers what they are due, though this is completely new, uncharted territory.
It's a really tough thing for exchanges because any of those three choices carries negative consequences.  And even making no choice, the split causes confusion to consumers.  Unless you are an exchange that supports every crazy trading pair, chain splits are tough to deal with.

It's not really the size that's the problem, it's the time to validate transactions, the cost of bandwidth and rate over time of relay, and the partition/DOS risks that have already barely been kept ahead of by hurculean efforts on the parts of the developers to improve relay, validation, etc.  Nobody is against scaling, even on-chain scaling.  Even luke-jr who is probably the most hardcore small blocker is not against eventual on-chain scaling.  We just want smart scaling first, and only use dumb scaling as a tool of last resort after all the smart things have been done.  We have a few really smart scaling solutions in the wings, and further engineering and science breakthroughs in the space might even make it possible to find new ones that won't require us to make such a trade-off with having to permanently increase the rate.

**THIS.**  Bitcoin is the biggest and oldest and most used, so it also has the biggest community, full of lots of rich people, and the greatest diversity of opinions.  Because of that, it has the most politics as well.  Any other coin reaching this phase will encounter similar levels of politics.
Edit: The good news is that we shouldn't fear this.  Bitcoin is pretty resistant to political meddling.  I am not worried about the politics and intrigue surrounding it because in the end, the best technical solutions that receive the most support will win.

Segwit would have activated before the point that the hard fork is scheduled.


My point is the hashpower will go where the money is.  If people buy the original coin instead of the new forked one, they hashpower will move to the most profitable coin.


That won't be a problem if the hashpower moves to the most profitable coin.  Hash power can move very rapidly in response to changing market conditions.


Again, segwit would have already been activated by this point, so blocks would be larger.  And nobody is opposed to even more scaling, we just want it to be done intelligently, in a well-tested, and safe way.


Agreed.  But the miners mine to make money.  Users will put their money on the most secure, stable, and useful chain.  If no quality development exists on the alternative chain, people won't buy and use it.

Everyone thought there was consensus in Ethereum and when they hard forked there would not be another chain that emerged, and that was with all of the key developers on board!  How did that work out for them?  I think you could say this hard fork is even more contentious than the ethereum one was, and this fork doesn't even enjoy the support of the core developers.  There are 25 core developers against the hard fork as constituted.  25!  That means a lot of exchanges playing it safe will at the very least list the original chain when the hard fork happens.  What then?


If a coin is supported by strong buy orders, why would there be no miners on the original chain supported by most of the core developers?  What we see is that hash power moves according to what is the most profitable coin/chain to mine.

You are comparing a very established monetary system with literally centuries of usage, use cases, and development to a brand new asset class, still experimental, with less than a decade (Bitcoin).  Of course it's going to be easier to learn fiat, and it's not necessarily meant to serve the same role.  It's also easier to use fiat for everyday transactions because it has been is highly integrated into society over a long period of time.  The Internet in the early days was also very hard to use, you had to get a modem, hook it up, install the right drivers, figure out where to dial in.  Much of what makes Bitcoin complicated today doesn't have to stay that way, it's easily possible in the future for the technology to simplify to the point to where people don't need to understand the mechanics behind it, much in the same way most people don't understand how most of the underlying detail of fiat money works: central banking, reserve requirement ratio, money-multiplier, discount window, money supply management, global ledger systems, API's, bank core processing systems, etc.


What do you mean "controllable"?  What are you trying to say, that 15% inflation is fine?  Lucky for the OECD countries that it's not worse than that, but if you lived in Venezuela or Argentina or Zimbabwe, or numerous others it has been far, far worse than that.
And even among those OECD countries, I'm not confident that the U.S. government, for example, will be able to keep inflation low given the looming debt crisis the U.S. is facing due to enormous deficits and debt load.  Are you?
Yes, Bitcoin has a LOT of price volatility right now, no question there, and it is being used for speculative purposes.  However, that doesn't to me mean it's *only* useful for speculation.  It's not going to replace fiat anytime soon, and the volatility means that for most people they couldn't use it as a savings account anytime soon but it could be useful to some as a digital gold with it's known supply and creation rate and very short-term transactions as well as cross-border payments, and the many potential uses as programmable money.  One small example, the escrow industry that requires court enforcement to ensure person A delivers money to person B upon completion of thing C is a huge industry right now that carries high costs as well as at times, legal uncertainty, for which there exists a whole other industry of insurance (real estate, for example, where this insurance is often thousands of dollars for a single transaction) that could be completely disintermediated and savings achieved with a programmable money like Bitcoin.


Why is that rubbish?  Bitcoin is still a developing technology with many interesting potential use cases.  What can Bitcoin or other potential cryptocurrencies never do?


I agree that most regulators do not think in terms of what is best for Bitcoin as a decentralized system.  Yeah agreement!  But it's not all bad.  Many are taking a wait and see approach.


It's a game changer, I think, because it opens a new set of use cases.  The one most interesting to me is using bitcoin in API requests which lightning makes a lot simpler.  Instant verification I think is a game changer.  LN has been promised a while, and it's still in beta, but that doesn't mean I think it will never achieve anything useful.


How do you know it's "manipulated by wall st and paper futures contracts?"  I don't dispute it necessarily but I'd like to see some evidence.  paper futures contracts are pretty new in the space.  But also, I think you are focused too much on price here.  


I don't think having dividends matters much.  It's like gold in that there are no dividends with gold.  


Then why are you here?  If you don't like it, there's a really simple thing you can do: don't buy it, and don't use it.  If you find it useful, great!  If you want to help the world have access to programmable money and help build the use cases for it, and see the value in it, then participate.  If you don't find it useful, then don't worry about it, nobody's forcing you to buy it or participate.  Just don't get involved.  We don't need more speculation, and we don't need people who don't see value in it.  It's OK being an experimental project for now.

Thank you, I will dream of that.  I'm not the only one.  You may have heard of a certain nobel prize winning economist who is often called one of the most influential economists of the 20th centuries--Milton Friedman.  He dreamed of something like that too.  He often advocated for money free from political influence.  He dreamed of money that was not based on a "board of experts" (central bankers) deciding it's cost through interest rate policies, or manipulating it's supply, but rather money based on computational factors.  It is a dream, but at least the dreamers are in good company.  
You're right that it's a hard problem, but that's not to say we can't hope for a future where it could be the reality and work toward making technology to bring it about, and for the first time, we can actually as cypherpunks, computer scientists, and software engineers start bringing about some piece of that dream and future in a permissionless way!  
Bitcoin is still an experimental project, still in relative infancy compared to the economic, fiscal, and monetary fiat systems that have been built up over literally centuries.  Bitcoin has less than a decade of time behind it.  Of course it's going to seem like a dream at this stage that it would completely replace fiat.  But that's OK.  Nobody expects a new economy to be built on it.  There are still many, many flaws and problems in the space to be worked out.  But it's still a remarkable achievement and Bitcoin has created an explosion of ideas right now, lots of innovation, and there is lots of engineering being done to improve the state of the art.  To me it's clear we are still at the beginning of a very long journey, and have only taken baby steps so far.


My issue is not simply with inefficiencies and opaqueness of government, but also regulatory capture (by entities like large banks), undue political influence, and people who think they are smart trying to decide the ideal factors for money.  Go read Alan Greenspan's book.  He often based many of his decisions on "intuition".  That's not the way many of us think it should be done.


First of all, who says Bitcoin has to be the only form of money?  And who says it has to be used in all transactions?  And who says that it or something like it can't change to meet different needs?  Bitcoin is more like digital gold than currency--it's goal is not price stability like one of the goals of the U.S. central bank, but rather, supply stability.  That may not be the best thing when you expect stable prices.  I do think it will stabilize over time, and with a first mover advantage, and network effects, it will have utility in some transactions, but probably not all.


Come on now, that's not a fair assessment.  You are right that Bitcoin in it's present form less than a decade old, cannot adequately serve all the needs that are met by all the existing centralized monetary, fiscal, and banking infrastructure built up over literally centuries.  But I wasn't making the argument that in it's present form it is meant to do that.  Even if it finds a useful niche in it's present form, even a small percentage of utility where it is superior to alternatives like perhaps gold or some transactional or international currencies would show us that there might be better ways in the long-run to reform the entire system.  I perfectly well recognize that there are countless important systems in place right now to maintain the entire fractional reserve system that exists today.  It doesn't mean that it's a great one, or that something like a programmable money can't lead us into a much better future!

Fortunately there's also a solution for that. Tim Ruffing posted an idea to the bitcoin developer mailing list so the signature can't be cracked while it waits in the mempool unconfirmed.

When online banking first appeared it was too complicated for most people to use.  And even fiat money today is not as simple as you think it is; you will realize this once you try to start teaching children about money.  There are a lot of concepts they have to learn that starts with first learning a lot of basics like addition, subtraction, dollars and cents, coins vs. paper, what banks are, why they exist, what credit cards are, how they differ from debit cards, etc., and then getting into simple economics about how money is made, why different types of work are paid different amounts, etc.
Another of your big criticisms here seems to be that the value fluctuates.  Many advanced economies take for granted that their fiat currencies have relatively stable values but you quickly learn that even in those countries those systems break down sometimes.  A few decades ago in the U.S. the inflation was over 15%.  Fiat is also not a great place to park value long term because it depreciates.
Bitcoin is in it's infancy.  Think of the early days of the Internet and online banking and so forth.  It took a long time for adoption.  Bitcoin still has a lot of user interface improvement and faces additional battles given the difficult regulatory environment.  I think we still have yet to see the "killer app" for Bitcoin.  Maybe lightning will help bring one about.

But the most compelling evidence that Finney didn’t invent Bitcoin or ghostwrite the 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper came during my visit to the Finneys’ Santa Barbara home.
I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, 20 minutes late due to traffic between Los Angeles and the Santa Barbara suburb. Fran Finney welcomed me into her home and brought me into the living room, where Finney himself sat in his wheelchair with his son Jason. His ventilator whirred rhythmically and the air smelled faintly of something sweet, like hot milk.
I apologized for being late. Finney’s first words to me, and the longest sentence I heard him speak in his robotic voice, were “Andy, it’s hard to time the drive from LA.” He had spent around ten minutes writing the sentence with his eye movements, just to comfort me about my tardiness. “We’re used to that kind of thing from him,” Fran told me. “He’s a good guy.”
I sat down with Finney and explained again the strange connections that had brought me to his home. Then I rehearsed the questions I’d asked through his wife over the phone. With his eyes, he gave the same friendly denials.
"Then Jason Finney brought me over to a computer to show me what he’d prepared: It was Finney’s Gmail account, opened to a January 2009 conversation between Finney and someone named Satoshi Nakamoto—clearly, the Satoshi Nakamoto. They had exchanged about fifteen emails, in which Finney described bugs he’d found in the early Bitcoin code and Nakamoto responded with fixes and notes of thanks.
The Nakamoto on the other end of the conversation wrote in fluent, colloquial English, not at all like Dorian Nakamoto. (I would later forward the emails to the same linguistics analysis firm who had earlier analyzed Nakamoto’s writings, Juola &amp; Associates, and they confirmed that the new emails matched the style of the Bitcoin whitepaper more closely than Finney’s writing, and far more closely than Dorian Nakamoto’s.)
Jason Finney also let me see the transaction record for his father’s Bitcoin wallet from 2009, which clearly showed that Finney had received Nakamoto’s ten-bitcoin test transaction on January 11th, 2009. The wallet evidence, along with the Gmail timestamps, would have been very difficult to forge. And the notion that Finney alone might have set up the two accounts and created a fake conversation with himself to throw off snoops like me, long before Bitcoin had any measurable value, seemed preposterous.
“My father is an honest guy,” Jason said. “He would have loved to have been part of creating Bitcoin, and he wouldn't have hidden it. But he wasn’t involved.”
At this point, I was convinced I had reached a dead end. All the signs that Finney might have had a secret hand in the creation of Bitcoin had turned out to be nothing more than an illusion of a signal in random noise.

But they only maintain "power" inasmuch as we users give them power.  If we saw the people with commit access abuse that by merging something to master that didn't have broad consensus, I guarantee you that their commit access would be revoked by the others, and failing that, I as well as many other users would jump ship fast and in droves.


I think that is an oversimplification of how the developers feel, and probably was written mostly by an eager BIP-148 supporter.  It's clear from more full transcripts of the meetings that many of the developers think the timeline and adoption and safety is just not there.  See:  


For one, I honestly believe based on my reading of the comments you are referring to from Greg Maxwell that he was primarily concerned that they were going to sneak in something in the hard fork that would keep ASICBoost from being disabled, not that he was trying to be adversarial.  It didn't help that Jeff Garzik was very vague in his responses about his intention and didn't just simplify mollify Greg's concerns by making a definitive statement.  In the end he finally did make a more definitive statement, and I think that's all Greg wanted.  I don't think Greg was intending to be adversarial at all based on my reading as an outside observer.  
Second, I do think that there is a level of frustration on the part of the Core developers that they are essentially being cut out and their recommendations being ignored when they are the ones who have helped scale and secure the network.  Without their help, I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin would have failed under the current load.  So to see their recommendations ignored by an outside group putting themselves in charge over development and not working on the traditional consensus process has got to make anyone feel a little defensive and you might see that come through a bit.


I agree, since most of the developers seem to take issues with the safety and speed of BIP-148, it probably suffers from the same problem.


I agree.

It's a company that makes Bitcoin mining hardware.  They also run their own pool of miners called "Antpool" which is one of the largest pools helping secure the network.  They have become controversial lately because they have been pushing for their own vision of Bitcoin and not willing to signal for readiness to an improvement made by the Bitcoin Core developers called Segwit.  Many in Bitcoin fall into one of two camps: those that want to see block size increase to keep transaction fees low and transaction volume high (at the expense of decentralization), and those who want to see block size be constrained until safely demonstrated it can scale.  There is disagreement about what that level is and how to go about deploying upgrades to make it happen.  EDIT: Bitmain falls into the big block camp.

The community does support segwit.  This is evidenced by the fact that 85% or more of the full nodes are running code that enables segwit.  The hashing is mostly controlled by a few large entities that don't represent the broader community.  Had the mechanism used been something like BIP-149 or done as we did with the P2SH soft fork, then the mining cartels would not have been able to block it.

Some developers have not commented yet.  Some developers were still evaluating it (like Eric Lombrozo I believe).  But as time has gone on, it's starting to become clear that the New York Agreement (btc1) project is antithetical to the open principles the Bitcoin Core project is based on, so it makes sense that everyone who contributed under an open community process would not be happy with the new regime.  See my comment here for an explanation of why: 
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:59:07
Because it's patented, and instead of being a regular optimization, it literally cuts down the intended security of the algorithm.  Imagine if ASICBoost allowed cutting out 50% of the intended work, or 90% of the intended work, and the patent means no one else can do it.  The entire purpose of a distributed lottery consensus system, the very foundation of bitcoin is totally broken. 
 Even the current skipping of work, and associated patent are worrisome enough to edge all other miners out of business, and may very well be part of the reason why miners like KNC Miner failed and went out of business.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:21:06
I believe this post was probably written or significantly contributed to by deadalnix.  It uses a similar style of writing and similar things he's said in the past.  Here's my response:


They still fail to understand that Bitcoin Core is not some centralized organization.  There are no "representatives" of Bitcoin Core.  There is nobody that can speak authoritatively for Bitcoin Core.  There is nobody who can commit Bitcoin Core to doing anything because Bitcoin Core is not some central organization.  It's a loose group of individual developers and works largely on a decentralized community process.  Any developer with a desire, technical clout, and a good track record can join "Bitcoin Core" and work on what they want, and if it's good, with a good proposal, good working code, and hard work to meet concerns of other engineers, it can make it's way into Bitcoin.  The way Bitmain writes here shows they still fundamentally misunderstand this vital community process because they treat Bitcoin Core as some kind of company with a traditional command and control structure that just needs to agree to something that everyone wants.


There has been no activity whatsoever on the mailing list.


This is just wrong.  Here is a list of Core developers that have spoken against BIP-148: Greg Maxwell, Suhas Daftuar, Matt Corallo, Marco Falke, Nicolas Dorier, Alex Morcos, Jorge Timon, Peter Wuille, Wladimir van der Laan.  Some of them support alternate approaches for getting segwit, but there is no justification for Bitmain saying "most of the software developers who work in a software project called 'Bitcoin Core' are also supporting it".  If most supported it, then support for it would probably already be merged into Bitcoin Core, so that argument fails.  You can see some of the core developers discussing it here: 


In what way?  Developers have been asking for more clarity on details of the New York agreement, such as whether segwit will actually activate, whether it includes ASICBoost, whether a hard fork must be a part of it or not, and other technical details such as block weight, block size, etc.  Some developers are concerned about the accelerated timeline, whether it will be adequately tested, whether it makes the deploy safe by activating segwit by taking advantage of existing segwit-ready clients, etc.  Part of the agreement included assuming good faith, Bitmain doesn't seem to be assuming good faith here.


The inventor himself of much of the technology behind Bitcoin says that this is not just a simple artificial scaling issue, the block size parameter is an important security parameter that protects the system.  Changes to it should be considered carefully by engineers.  See: 


This is a clear case where Bitmain is showing that they are purposely holding Segwit back to try to get leverage for a hard fork block size increase.  Unfortunately, soft forks have always been something that could in theory be activated by a smaller portion of the ecosystem, while hard forks require much greater support in order to prevent chain splits.  This is the nature of how Bitcoin works.  The problem they seem to be ignoring is that a significant portion of the ecosystem is not yet convinced that hard forking is the way to solve the problem.  An overwhelming majority is needed to hard fork safely, more research needs to be done, and it's hard to measure that actual support.


Everyone wants Bitcoin to scale, but we want it to be done intelligently.  I think they don't realize that a majority of Bitcoiners won't follow their UAHF chain if the majority of the developers don't believe that is a sound way to scale Bitcoin.


What they don't take into account is that the major bottleneck to scaling is not just hardware, but the bandwidth required to run a full node.  And they seem to downplay the importance of full nodes in securing the coin itself.  Not to mention the fact that the block size is important for a number of other reasons, such as miner centralization.  Of course, Bitmain seems happy to try to control all of the Bitcoin hash power, but that centralization is very damaging, and increasing block size helps miners like them centralize, so their incentives are not properly aligned with the community's desire of a decentralized Bitcoin.  For an example of mining centralization pressure that arises from increased block size, see this discussion between Gavin Andresen and Peter Todd: 


For their hard fork to be successful, they will need to convince a majority of users to run it.  Nobody is forcing anyone to run Bitcoin Core.  We run it because it is developed in the open with a community process.  It can be frustrating as a developer to have to face that kind of public scrutiny, but Bitmain thinking that privately developing then releasing is going to instill enough confidence for others to run their client is mistaken.


they are describing patents of Blockstream.  Blockstream has committed in the strongest way possible to ensure no patent will be used against the Bitcoin ecosystem: 


These parameters were chosen very carefully.  While there's always room for some disagreement, the vast majority of developers agreed on them because segwit transactions are better for preventing UTXO bloat, which is very important for scaling.  They act as if there's no purpose served by it.


Again they are treating "Core" as some kind of central organization.  I'd like to see what kind of proposal they could come up with that would make Lightning run more safely and reliably.


Who is working on this?  Where is the code?  Is this being developed in secret? EDIT: working in secret, then presenting something to the community is not necessarily a problem, but the way this is written makes it look like it's being developed in secret, probably without consulting any of the other core developers with expertise in this area that have also probably been working on this, and leaves the impression that it's being done in such a way that it's already in "last stage review" to be included in the Bitmain-supported code with little community feedback.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:00:42
I think the engineers want to use raising the block size as the measure of last resort if no new engineering is discovered or no new methods are known.  Turns out, we have several options for scaling still without having to increase block size and sacrifice any decentralization, like Schnorr signatures, MAST, etc.

I think that's mostly because of the process.  Contrast Bitcoin Core's process that includes:
* Open community development
* Consensus-driven changes
* Placing sound engineering above political desires
* Emphasis on safety
With the New York Agreement:
* Coding being done in private then released for acceptance with no chance of alteration, a lot of backroom deal-making and horse-trading (see comments from jgarzig on github, for example, where he justifies something after a private discussion with Bitmain)
* Code being made to match a political agreement rather than what might be sound engineering
* A time-table to implementation that is laughably short, doesn't give the ecosystem time to upgrade, uses a process that doesn't give or encourage developers to adequately test, and then expects it to be implemented within a mere month or two
* Proposes a hard-fork by believing that hash power and some economic players can override the will of average users
* No evidence that it will be safe to deploy and not risk splitting the network or causing major damage.  Contrast this to the 95% hash power and backwards compatibility of the original segwit proposal from Core.
You can see why, based on process alone, many would consider it to be completely antithetical to the principles upon which Bitcoin as an open-source, community-driven project was built on.
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:57:49
It doesn't work like that.  Miners follow the users, not the other way around.  And the way that works, is based on what users are willing to pay for each chain.  If miners choose to fork, they are welcome to.  But if they fork to some software primarily controlled by them, who would buy those tokens?  And when the demand for Bitcoin on the chain managed by a competent group of developers stays high, then hash rate will move to the place that's more profitable.

Nah, users decide the rules; the hashpower like Jihan just follows those rules.  The only rules hashpower can decide is to get more restrictive, not less restrictive, which means soft forks, not hard.  And, so what if Jihan wants Core devs booted?  What's he got to replace them?  The vast majority of users are going to run a client that's supported by an open community process, where ideas are thoroughly vetted, and that attracts the most talent, and that has a focus on safety and security.  So far the only thing that comes close is the Core project right now.  Jihan can fork, and maybe some people will go along, or he can hold back changes proposed on BIP-9, but he can't boot Core.  Only the majority of users can do that.  He'll soon find that out if he attempts his private fork.

Accepting cash costs quite a lot.  First, you have to keep cash in the cash register so you have proper change when a customer wants to pay that way.  So you have to make bank runs frequently to make sure you have the right balance of 1's, 5's, 10's, 20's, and coins.  Then you have to cash out the till at the end of the day, train the employees on that, and have procedures if the machine amount doesn't match the received amount.  It's bad when it doesn't reconcile, and this happens all the time.  Then you make to make regular runs to the bank to deposit the money, or pay an employee to do that, and ensure that the cash doesn't get stolen.  There are a lot of these costs that handling cash imposes.

Please try to be civil, and keep insults to a minimum.  You seem to know more about people working on it than I do, but then again, I'm just an outside observer.  Who is coding it?


I simply reply to posts about segwit because that's what the community is discussing.  I think there are more than five though.  I only get on occasionally to post.  I would like to see segwit for the malleability fixes and possibilities it brings for chained transactions, and want it to be done in a safe way.


Why would it crap out after two months?  You mean reach a cap?  I'm assuming you made a typo.  To me segwit does two important things: it gives us short term relief on the transaction limit by helping it increase slightly (which gives us more data on the safety of increased bandwidth use, etc. and how it affects decentralization, miner incentives, etc), and second, it opens the door to all types of new transactions that could significantly help scaling.
I hate the fee situation as much as anyone, we all do.  We would all love transactions to be as cheap as possible with no other negative consequences.  I just want to make sure we do things in a smart way that preserves the most important property of Bitcoin: decentralization.

I don't think you know what he is actually saying.  When did he argue against quadrupling the block size?
Also, I don't know how you can believe the size could be increased that much without negative effects unless you don't think miner centralization, increased orphan rates, or decreased number of decentralized full nodes are negative--the Bitfury study found that excluded nodes at 4X could be as high as 75% to 80%.  Second, it increases the possibility of miner centralization, especially if a lot of mining occurs in only one country because it increases the possibility of orphans for those that aren't well connected.  Third, there are the other problems that have been brought up with increasing sizes, such as the built in motivation for miners to only propagate to slightly over 50% of the hashing power also increasing centralization.  See the problem as outlined here: 


Not for doing peer-to-peer relay over Tor, or other places where mining often happens in remote locations with poor connectivity.


But it also requires a much larger portion of the ecosystem to upgrade and coordinate in order to prevent a chain split, so it would probably take a lot longer to do and wouldn't bring many of the benefits I've personally been waiting for, namely ability to replace signature scheme and a fix for transaction malleability.


I think BitcoinCash is fine.  I'm fine with a contingent of users creating their own fork.  I think it's preferable to have a concept of extension blocks or sidechains or drivechains so many different people can experiment with completely different consensus rules and still talk together using a cohesive currency (which segwit also helps enable).  But if a certain portion of the ecosystem just can't live with that, I'm OK with them hard forking off into their own chain and ecosystem.

This one company you quoted (Berkshire Hathaway) has a market cap that is about 8 times the size of Bitcoin.  So yeah, Bitcoin could get a lot bigger than it it now.

What else do you propose then that could garner the 80-95% agreement then?  When I look at the Bitcoin businesses that supported the original segwit, it looks like almost all of them except Roger's group and Bitmain.  Maybe there's another proposal better than segwit that could accomplish most of the positive segwit benefits and be supported by a majority, but I haven't seen any such thing, have you?


I agree it's not only an engineering problem, you are right about that, there is game theory and economics.  However, if something doesn't have sound engineering, then that to me overrides other concerns since at it's core, it's a programmatic system; if that security is compromised, nothing else will matter.  And yes, there is no "clear" path forward, so maybe it's fine that we have the status quo rather than poor upgrades.  It's not what I'd prefer, but you're right that perhaps we need better data and more engineering and study to find alternative ways forward.


You just said that there isn't good data on a clear path forward, and then say Core refused to take some unspecified action, wrongly.  How is that?  What I saw core release was a proposal (segwit) that hasn't gotten a high super-majority, so it didn't activate.  They didn't force something on the community that it didn't want.  It required 95% of hash assent, and hasn't achieved it.


That is a good point, but I think that we should also keep in mind that Ethereum is also very brittle.  If something happened to Vitalik, where would that community be?  It might prove that a "benevolent dictator" is a better way to go for a currency, but despite market cap, I think that's yet to be seen in the long-term.  Ironically, the best thing that could happen to Bitcoin is the ability to test new changes via something like sidechains or other layers, where anyone could create stuff without having to have permission, or go through the difficult consensus process required for changes... and the reason this is ironic is because segwit goes a long way to enabling this very functionality (as did some other soft forks, CSV, CTLV, etc)!  I'd be all for another well-engineered solution that can help us anchor transactions and remove malleability.  I think it's really needed.




Hang on, I don't know that core has asserted users don't want it as the only reason for not doing it.  They have said, from what I've read, among engineers, there is the general feeling that they don't feel it's safe yet as an engineering problem, that nobody has done the requisite work to show first that as an engineering problem it can be safe to increase block size much, and that there is a good way they can be sure that a very high majority of the ecosystem will accept it.  That is difficult to measure, unlike the softfork mechanism which uses hashpower that isn't subject to Sybil attacks.  
I can find statements from pretty much every core engineer that some level of block size increase is probably needed, and that they would like to see block size increase in a well-done, conservative/safe way, with the exception of only one, perhaps luke-jr.  It's a misunderstanding I believe to think that they say "users don't want it so we're not going to do it", there are many more concerns.  It's just a high barrier to get over the engineering problems, and then ensure there is a very high level of consensus.  Peter Wuille was so thrilled when he found a way that some of that deadlock could be overcome when they realized they could use a safer engineering method (soft fork) to get an increase most engineers felt could be safely accomplished when they discovered segwit.  It turns out even that change has been controversial for some reason, so a block size increase which is even more controversial and requires even more difficult engineering and higher supermajorities (since not reverse compatible) is going to be even harder to accomplish.
The point is nobody has data on it.  Since a hard fork is a much higher hurdle to climb than a soft fork (since it's not backward compatible), then anyone who wants to attempt it has the burden to show or somehow get a supermajority of not just hashing but the entire ecosystem.


It's the only game in town because the best engineers are attracted by it's practices, and great engineers like to work together.  Any group of great engineers is free to start a competitor, but unless the current set of great engineers for some reason fails to do great engineering, the best will still be attracted to work within that process.  I am a software engineer, and I have carefully evaluated the system, and the core engineers have my confidence.  I hate the fact that fees are so high.  I hate the fact that we are running into limits.  I would far prefer a system with increased transaction volume.  But at the moment, I see from an engineering perspective the reasons for conservative approaches, and the fact that even for high end computers, the stream required for even today's blocksize is very high in my own tests.  Bitcoin can never scale on chain, as is, to transact in the proverbial coffee purchases of the world, not even close.  We need more engineering to solve the problem on other layers, drivechains, sidechains, lightning, sharding, or some other solution.  We should not compromise the network today even though it hurts to see other coins gain share, or blocks get full and increase fees.




That's not true.  We are sure it will split unless a very, very high majority does it, and unlike a soft fork, it's not a hashing majority, but a client majority.  We already saw a coin that thought they had a super majority have a split into two major coins (ETH and ETC).

I think it's more likely they didn't provide data because they didn't want to support BIP-148 for other reasons, not that they don't think that segwit doesn't have high community support.  One can believe segwit has high support (Which I think the core developers believe), while also believing that BIP-148 or short activation of segwit is a bad idea due to chain split risk.  Within the context of the discussion you are referring to, it makes sense that a metric of segwit support would not be needed.


You have a point about the need to be conservative, and that's why the BIP-9 mechanism was created.  But nobody really did forsee a situation where minors would block what seems like a pretty good piece of engineering (segwit), which didn't make sense until ASICBoost was discovered, or trying to hold the network hostage until getting bigger blocks at all cost (including keeping number of transactions constrained, supposedly the very thing people blocking segwit want).  It's hard to fathom much opposition to segwit otherwise, given the positive benefits.
I mean, who doesn't want us to be able to try things like lightning, sidechains/drivechains, rootstock, Schnorr sigs?  Even Roger Ver, I have noticed, is not against segwit, he just doesn't think it's important in terms of order of improvements, and wants a hard fork so much, he thinks temporarily holding back that particular improvement was a battle worth fighting.  Part of the reason for this is I think he believes that the improvements segwit will bring are some time away, and also, he doesn't like the core developers since they believe major increases are unsafe so he'd rather put a different technical team in place more ideologically aligned with his belief.  As a result, a good piece of engineering is caught in the middle.


Here is the statistics:
People wouldn't run a nodes that would automatically activate segwit if they were against segwit.
You think the statistic of what nodes are actually reporting that they are running is less valid than comparing the difference between sub-reddits?  I frequent both sub-reddits but that doesn't mean much.

Removing core from power would be a lot easier than impeaching.  The reason core has support in the first place is because they follow a community process and many top developers choose to contribute to it.  The minute a few violate that principle and lock everyone else out, the entire ecosystem would quickly move elsewhere.

Why is it a distraction?  Looking for an honest answer.  I used to be on Gavin's side until I started researching it more.  The thing that really convinced me was Nick Szabo's position on it.  You know who he is right?  He was thinking about cryptocurrency and designing Bitcoin-like systems long before Bitcoin came out and many of his ideas were the precursors for Bitcoin.  He pioneered the concept of the smart contract.  He has no relation to Blockstream.  Here's what he said in the recent interview with Tim Ferris:




He goes on to talk about second layer solutions as being the only realistic way to scale and preserve the security.  Listening to brilliant engineers like him and considering the data are what convinced me that other layers are what's needed to scale.  That that we can't have some block increases, but that there are definite problems and risks with scaling in this fashion.
