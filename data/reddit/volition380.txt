They should have been more sensitive about self imposing socialism and socialist inclined policies first

I doubt it's Greeks buying btc, it's people watching on who are worried buying the btc

Haha good point, reminds me of the typical USA govt debt ceiling debate

I prefer the term extortion for taxes. And yeah while I prefer the anarcho capitalist vision, sometimes we have to meet people where they're at and inch them towards liberty. So I'll use terms like tax competition to help inch them closer

Tax competition is wonderful

Just if anyone is curious, here is the listing of the [top 100 bitcoin addresses]( Bear in mind though, that since we don't know who owns these addresses - multiple of them could belong to the same person.

The difference here is - they used to be reasonably sure that individuals would be forced to actually USE that currency (legal tender laws, and the fact that you must pay that government's taxes in its currency etc). The governments of the world are free to create cryptocurrencies, but that does not necessarily mean people will use them.

20/20 hindsight - it's hard to recognise a paradigm shift when it's occurring, but after it has occurred it always seems so obvious

Yeah I think an analogy here would be how Facebook keep copying features of other social networks (e.g. there's even talk of them implementing the hashtag into FB), and combined with the network effect - they've managed to stay top so far. This may not always be the case though.

I think the profit incentive is still important too, how else will people be motivated to produce/work without it?

With any luck though, other companies will follow the lead!

I believe Mike Hearn (one of the Bitcoin developers) referred to this as Assurance Contracts - he speaks about it in this [talk](

I think you make good examples with Altavista and Livejournal, however I would respond by saying: yes Bitcoin may not always be the market leading cryptocurrency, the point is that once you have a network effect (and path dependency in place) - changes won't happen overnight, unless the new competition absolutely blows Bitcoin out of the water. We're talking something like Gmail coming out to crush Hotmail/Yahoo/all other emails when they first came out with the 5GB limit (rather than the terrible 25mb or 50mb/whatever it was every other provider gave you back then). And even then it still took time.

You're missing the point. What if circumstances arise such that you didn't have advance notice of needing to send funds?

possibly via affiliate link? just a guess

Maybe we're getting our causation the wrong way around here. I view it more like: The reason Bitcoin had to be invented, was *because* of fiat currency being debased. The more the governments of the world debase the currency, the more reason for people to store value via Bitcoin instead.

Great idea, I like your point about how a politician's reputation is extremely important to them. 
However I can see some hurdles (which may be insurmountable) - aren't there limits on the amount of individual donations or amount of donations that can be received from one single company? These limits could not be easily enforced if they accepted bitcoin... e.g. if the individual donation limit was $10,000 - if John Smith hit that limit, he could just donate from another bitcoin address (and the political party would have no way of knowing).

Ok so for your 1st point, an example of this might be plumbers (or any tradesmen really) who want to accept payment in bitcoin while they're out and about at their clients across the suburbs/city. 
For your 2nd point - as an example I had another idea, what about a service that was completely 'opaque' to the end customers but simply used BTC to be more efficient / save money. e.g. A lot of people from China send money home to their family. There might be an opportunity for a BTC company to set up and easily facilitate international money transfer (but make it so that the person doesn't have to deal in BTC, to them it just looks like they're transferring money as normal). This allows the company to profit from the cheaper international transfers, and the person sending money to/fro home wins too because this service makes it easy to use.

This strikes me as extremely unfair. Also, how will it not cause a run on the banks?

Sometimes the best answer is the simplest one: Let the market decide

This is a great comment and shows good understanding of bitcoin and business.
I would just add: If a company chooses to take the long position and actually hold Bitcoin, this may create higher compliance costs and uncertainty due to Bitcoin's status. I think questions like: Is it a currency or a commodity? How do you account for it and show it within the financial statements correctly? Especially considering it's a FTSE100 company and will have all manner of disclosure requirements and legal hurdles to overcome.
I suspect it would be cheaper/easier to begin on the short position for this company as this would be easier to account for.
