its the fact I did everything right and I have no fucking coins.

Yeah. Support ticket guy was a moron. Called them and talked to a guy with a brain who saw everything and said it looks good and should be due to the gdax outage. But still...

Yeah, but like what if they lost my coin... I know this happened with mt gox. Is there anything in place for situations like this again?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:36:54
I never asked you to come fix my problem you troll.
I was upset, rightfully so. You are a fucking moron and i'm done replying to you cause it's a waste of my time. Hopefully you find something to do with yours other than being a low life palsy.

I did, it looks like they went from coinbase to a ton of different things, but I don't know enough. I have two factor on my account and no one should have been able to touch my account since I was holding my phone the entire day, so unless coinbase was hacked and someone was able to manipulate their backend to send coins to tons of addresses I don't know what to make sense of
edit: Also, the coins never went to gdax and I was the one who initiated the trade so it all went as planned until coinbase made the transfer to gdax.

lucky you... seems they are investigating it now. I don't know how to feel. Has this every happened in the past?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:28:11
Go fuck yourself then
Considering coinbase is insured double go fuck yourself
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:22:38
I sent BTC from my trezor to GDAX. Coinbase shows I got the coin, and then TRANSFERRED IT TO GDAX. I Never got the coin on GDAX. WTFFFFFFF??????????????
Coinbase support says it should be fine... but still...... I AM MISSING MY MONEY WTF? This DOES NOT FEEL FINE
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:13:38
Lets back it up buddy. I went to sell my coins. I control them on my trezor. Do you just go cash out your coins at your local store? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:43:31
Once again, you are a fucking moron.
No1 told me "it will be okay" learn to fucking read.
The exchange DID start an investigation, i didn't cry for them to, they did. They even "deployed a fix" which we will see if it works for me. You are literally retarded.
This wasn't on the exchanges cold storage hence why its fucking insured. again stop because you literally are clueless. 
Stop acting as if I came here and was like PARISH PLEASE SAVE MY COINS, I didn't ask a single person here to help me save my coins, or track a transaction or do shit. You are literally illiterate.
 good bye.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:32:51
I didn't "sell all my coins at once". Stop making assumptions because you clearly don't know. I sold "a part" of what I have invested. 
This isn't greed stop trying to preach like you are some higher power. I tried to sell coins which i keep in cold storage on an excahnge i've done this hundreds of times. They literally have an investigation on their website posted about this exact problem and a solution deployed. Yeah im praying I get my money back who the fuck wouldn't.
you are judging with literally no information and its fucking hilarious. just stop 
edit: 20% is only 20% but 20% of 100k (not saying this is what I have just an example) is 20 fucking thousand dollars. "Only 20 percent" can still be a significant amount of money.
