Core, is not the idiots here shouting &amp; rambling. Not whole core wants smaller blocks and is happy about current situation. Discussion here is not discussing with core.

Is that the argument? A silly voice? 
Everybody is for bigger blocks at this point. You can be for or against either road to scaling, but lets keep the discussion to facts reflected against your own vision of how proper scaling should look.

We are at the point both sides use personal attacks for a discussion about technology and economics. Both sides have made sensible arguments.

And remember the fee was 1$ ?

Easy mate.  I tried (and failed terribly) to b..... never mind, have an upvote.

You damn purists!
You have to be pragmatic at some point. Some idiots called me Judas for simply having a XAPO card. I just keep &lt; 1 BTC, on the xapo, and If i run low, i re-fill it from my saver wallet where i do control keys.

Xapo works well for me so far. Make sure you backup your 2-step authenticator. You can activate multiple 2-step device, by scanning the initiation QR code  simultaneous.

Not true...
He kind is forced in this position by lack of insight (economics and tech) of poor souls that want bigger blocks (lol, foolzzz).
We tried reasoning, argue, discussion... fools won't listen. Go luke!!!!!!

Lol, I hope people can see the irony of posting this in this sub

Would SegWit2x, (block size increase including) be a worst-case scenario?
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:15:05
Good idea! Make sure it becomes a true altcoin! What will be the name?
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:52:49
And how do you backup your oh so great devices?
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:29:55
Go to litecoin if ypu like Segwit so much....
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:54:26
Sorry, we don't care... get back to with your crap
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:31:44
Ypu are allowed to wine about fee, as long as you acknowledge segwit as solution
