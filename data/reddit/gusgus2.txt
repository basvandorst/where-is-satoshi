So basically, you have no problem GAW is scamming people, just as long as you're still making profit?
Really selfish, but to each their own

I think any interview with Josh can be considered BS. Whatever he says, has no credibility around here

I like using the blockchain.info app too. The watch wallet is a side feature of the app as it's also a mobile wallet

Yeah I saw that, but the letter refers to the company as GAW miners. I thought legal letters need to be specific so it woulda said Geniuses At Work instead. Like I said, I'm just nit picking

I thought bad publicity is still publicity, but a leader in the community asking loyal customers to seek out naysayers and troll them seems pretty desperate.
Also pretty snidey as an official business practice

I have litecoin tracker installed but don't have that pop up block extension. What I did find though was a Searchme 1.2 extension which was present in FF, Chrome and Safari.
Would that be part of the same malware or could it be something else entirely?

Does anyone remember the press photos of Josh and the rows of asics? It was an emptyish warehouse with only two rows of shelves.
[Here]( is what I found on google but I think there were more hi res shots within the hashtalk forum.
Most other pics of asic warehouses I've seen showed several rows of miners

If GAW had a conscience then they would react with the market rather than allow customers to continue to purchase hashlets that make zero profits.
If they genuinely cared for their customers, they would sell only hashlets that could make some profit after fees. Oh wait, that won't happen cuz they need new customers to fund the payouts for the existing ones...

This might sound nit picky, but I thought GAW was an acronym for Geniuses At Work?
What's the official company name?

It's also bad publicity regarding cryptocurrencies. If Joe Public wants to get into cryptos and Googles info on it, he'll find a history of scams.
Not everyone who is into mining is in it for 100% profit. Some people want to see the industry grow and be useful in the future.

Can I get a saouce for that?

To be devil's advocate as I'm a front end developer, they could both be using a theme that looks similar
