Just think about the implications in the USA. If the Government doesn't recognize bitcoin as any sort of currency, they are doomed because there is a first amendment case to fall back on whereas communicating with the blockchain is nothing more than a freedom of speech issue. I firmly believe that the reason that the Senators more or less folded like a cheap suit during the hearings is because they were given legal advise not to attempt to push this into the courts where a first amendment ruling would be favorable towards the validity of bitcoin. Without any court rulings they would be free to 'nip at the heels' of cryptocurrencies without taking too many risks for judicial remediation.

A digital Postal service where IOU's are put into ripples(XRP) like an envelope and shuttled around the world. I guess.

Better yet equip your tower with a swap drive if possible allowing you to take your hard drive to work or wherever.

Just think of it this way. One bitcoin would have to be worth a million dollars before a Satoshi reaches the same value as a penny.

I feel like my sins are now cleansed since I listen to this Bitcoin sermon.

This morning yes, I didn't even need to manually redeem my Gox code that I received via email.

Verizon gets an economic benefit by modulating radio waves to transfer data back and forth between cell phones into the network. Think of a bitcoin as a slice of a portal in which monetary value can be shuttled around the planet ultimately through the blockchain and miners who maintain it. Since there is a finite amount, as more monetary value moves through the system the more valuable each slice becomes.

Seriously, this reminds me of all the sports talk shows that broadcast all around the world. They talk about what they think what will happen on any given game, and talk about what happened after any given game, but in the long run the game plays itself out and what they say about it makes no difference.

Seasteading is the best bet for now I suppose.

So does this mean that if this goes on for hours their bankroll will be eaten down to nothing due to fees?

Ya, the past bubbles look more like goosebumps.

Too much wine to comply.

Picked up ~35 BTC by trading alts on BTC-E can't wait to do it again.

How about a third option. Planetary Resources lassos an asteroid full of gold and hurls semi processed gold foam balls into the atmosphere landing somewhere like the Bonneville salt flats to be processed and delivered to market.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I was told that citation pages are numbered and they just can't throw them out without breaking protocol.

If you only concentrate on the price you still fail, it's still a payment mechanism also no matter the price so spare us the tears.
