What the fuck are eSports?

You don't need an intricate knowledge of science to be against it, either.
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:46:58
good enough for you?
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:56:28
I too would like to know this
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:48:26
I could not agree with you more.  ESPECIALLY with regard to the anti-altcoin negativity around here.
Dogecoin has done more to introduce the next generation to cryptocurrency than any of you sweaty nerds could have dreamed of being able to, and you shun it.  
It's the same, goddamned thing you idiots.
Shame on you, you arrogant assholes.

This is normal behaviour for multibit.  It has to do with bloom filters.  The solution is to "Reset Blockchain" on the affected wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:04:13
"Those people," is your mom, in all likelihood, BTW  
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:02:08
It does explain it, the problem is that we coders have yet to come up with an eloquent way to present it that most people will understand.
Belive me, when you get it it will be a forehead-slap nobrainer

Mcxnow, I will tolerate, despite the fact that I don't like RealSolid.  Why? Because he is free to run his website however he wants.

@_date: 2014-05-02 14:27:58
After nearly two months writing the code for the site, it is ready for launch.  We will be adding more inventory in the near future. Any input or feedback is greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:43:21
Now if only coingig would come back :(
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:39:07
Ease of use?  apparently you have never sold stuff on ebay!
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:42:59
That would be silly, considering how much heating fuel costs up here :)

About fucking time
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:02:43
I agree that the site needs more metadata.  I am working with the jewelers who own the business to get the specs for the products listed on the site.  Feel free to call them on the phone if you have any questions about a specific piece.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:05:15
I got two refunds from them without issue.  $13k each.  shrug
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:21:18
This is true.  Tons of startups went bust and a lot of speculators lost a LOT of money.
But please hear me out on this; had someone approached you in 1999 and said "invest in yahoo," or "invest in ubid," or "invest in AOL" you would have been wise to have approached their advice with a healthy dose of skepticism. 
Likewise, you would be ill advised to blindly jump on the bandwagon of coinbase, or circle, or hashfast, or what have you.
However, had someone approached you in 1994 and said "You should invest in RF spectrum," and you had the means to do so, you would not only be very wealthy but would have jumped on the unique opportunity to own a large chunk of a system that has revolutionized communication. [1][2]  
That's all

Granted, we ONLY accept BTC at the moment, but it's only because I haven't had time to set up stripe. :)  We opened almost a month ago but haven't had any sales yet.

I'm okay with this.  They wrote the code, I think they deserve the opportunity to be the first out the door with it.  
However, PLEASE follow through and open source the project after your well deserved and hopefully successful launch.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:53:27
start one?
@_date: 2015-03-12 11:49:04
Next step:
Identify which chip is the SATA controller.  Find the datasheet for it, locate your VCC and GND pins and measure the voltage between the two with the device plugged in.  Trying to figure out here if the SATA controller is even turning on. There might be more to it than that (such as watching the voltage on a particular pin with a scope to figure out if it's getting a "turn on" signal) but I can't help further without pictures or some way to figure out exactly which make/model the SATA controller chip is...
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:58:42
Hit me! 
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:30:31
I would venture to guess that the voltage regulator powering the ICs fried.  These are ~~5v devices I believe~~ 3.3v devices and the ballast resistor next to the LED is probably the only component between it and VCC / GND (explaining why it comes on, but the device itself doesn't)
1) do you have a good multimeter handy?
2) can you take a very detailed closeup of both sides of the device (multiple photos if necessary) and post them here?
This is the datasheet for this device BTW:

I want to see this wallet cracked, and how long it takes.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:17:11
Thank you.
I've been pondering this myself.  This thing we've created is terrifying in all its glory.

god, fuck social media.
just use some common sense

You can cancel your in-progress withdrawals without receiving an email.
Just click "finances" at the top of the page, then click the "History" button at the bottom.  
Find your withdrawal request, it should look like this:
Withdrawal BTC to address 1Blahblahblahblahblah
Cancel | Resend email
Click the "Cancel" or "Resend email" link.
Done :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:17:43
The "Money hold" shows up when you change your password.  This is a security measure
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:26:06
I think I screwed something up :/
I sent it as a withdrawal from btc-e, which confirmed but had multiple outputs (they combine withdrawals) so maybe it's confusing things.

It's the bit going to: 
I used blockchain.info/wallet/send-shared

Upping the ante :)
~0.9 incoming via shared-send
@_date: 2013-09-28 09:54:54
Same happened to me.
I would not be surprised if this has something to do with blockchain-opencl being added to john the ripper recently.  If someone can figure out your wallet identifier, IIRC, they can freely download the encrypted wallet blob that is normally decrypted by javascript in your browser and attack it offline.  There was a post here on reddit some months back describing the process.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:27:15
There, it FINALLY posted

Yes, the pentium pro is basically gold powered, for instance.

fantastic! my scion needs a new set of shocks
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:37:04
Wouldn't this make the price go up?
If you can't withdraw RMB(CNY, whatever) any longer, I'd imagine the price of BTC would skyrocket as people try to get their money off of the exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:05:45
that would cost an insane amount in fees to spend!  
fees are calculated based on the transaction size at 0.0001 per 1kb
a standard transaction (one input, one output) is around 500 bytes
so, a tx of 1 BTC would be around 50 MB, and would cost 5000 BTC to send.
so, please don't do that!
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:02:41
How can I verify that this cannot interact with my coinbase account?
@_date: 2013-08-30 06:21:24
From where was it stolen?  
Also, do you by chance have a record of your wifi card's mac address?
