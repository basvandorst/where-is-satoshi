I disagree, if you look at history, it has been ebb and flow between centralized and decentralized.
Really it just takes the US to ban it to kill it. A currency is no currency at all if it lacks access to the biggest market in the world.
I see three scenarios happening:
1) Govts absorbing bitcoin/or adopting an "official" digital currency. If this happens, this will strip the best part about crypto currencies; the anonymity and lack of oversight. What this means is that transactions would be monitored, taxes levied, value controlled (at minimal partially), etc etc. It will be the digital complement to the dollar. I see this as the most likely version.
2) Govt letting crypto currencies exist privately under the umbrella of the US dollar but would require searchable transactions and ability to levy taxes. This just means current market plus some govt regulations.
3) Govts ban or heavily restricts cryptocurrencies and driving it underground. This is the least likely because the world needs a digital currency standard and blockchain is a legitimate technology.

Lol this will never happen.

There are no official fiscal and monetary policy as those are conducted in US dollars.
The govt hasnt really proposed anything, but once big banks officially integrate blockchain into their existing products expect swift movements.

Yes if you bought in as a co-owner and is responsible at over 10X the increase in business. You obviously would be better suited at running the business over the first guy.
Dont forget bitcoin is in the news because of the wealth gain and wealth gain only. Super vast majority of bitcoin users and owners dont actually know blockchain they just get s super high level picture of the process. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:06:27
No no it is not like that at all.

Dude you have a problem.

Pretend there is a super edgy new coin out and everyone sell bitcoins to go over to that and all the bitcoins are then left to lets say 10 people. How much would bitcoin be valued? 
The point of this exercise is to prove to you there is nothing "intrinsic" about the value of bitcoin. In fact people are partially right about the value of the dollar too. But the difference is there is a vast more power, resources, institutions, and billions of lives at stake to make the dollar valuable and not so much for bitcoin. 
You have to admit the current price of bitcoins is super inflated due to speculation, and it's true value is somewhere back to its price around 2011-2012. Govts will never adopt bitcoin as an official electronic currency. You greatly misunderstand the relationship between power, economics and society/governance.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:59:49
And bitcoiners and speculators right now arent selling an inflated and corrupt financial instrument?

Over 95% of the people here don't actually give a fuck about bitcoin, they care about money lol.
How many people would seriously care if Bitcoin is 1 cent each? Vast majority of people here are speculators, marketers, and new people who heard about the money they could make.
That's why you hear the same thing over and over again in bitcoin forums because it is all soundbites. How many people here actually understand technology, economics; or governance?

Restricting the amount of dollars for example provides a way to inscribe value to it, that is true. But the point isnt to provide scarcity, it is to provide a value. 
Like you said infinite money is worthless. So if I'm the govt and I want a dollar to be worth X, then I limit the amount of the dollar ( or print more) until it is worth X. This is well known and not a secret.
It's like saying there is a conspiracy when you play monopoly and you can in fact start and have infinite monopoly money at all times. You can, but that ruins the game doesnt it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:45:57
If something has intrinsic value it will not be worth $0.00. 
Even if apples were free you can still probably sell it for some money. Think bottled water.!
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:58:30
And then what will you use bitcoins for?

I know what you are trying to say, def support the movement to support gay rights and social acceptance of gay people. And certainly large scale of sexuality in marketing is off putting.
But look at it from this perspective. When you meet a stranger and are trying to build a rapport what do you do? Find some similarity between you two right? Something you both agree on. This is why strangers complain about the weather, or the news or men/women objectifying the other sex, because we KNOW they feel the same. Everyone hates terrible weather, so you can build rapport from that. And everyone is sexual so men and women use sexuality as well.
The trick is to know when it is acceptable or not. In a professional setting with people I dont know it would be extremely stupid thing to do, but with close friends it is the opposite. If you pull this with close mates people will know you are missing the point.

It's getting banned in two weeks because people are using it to illegally bypass capital controls so... do it and be caught on a list? Lol.
The government would love people like you.
