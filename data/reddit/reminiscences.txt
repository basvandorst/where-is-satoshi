Congrats man, I just heard of bitcoins a few hours ago and Iam still synchronizing with a network. I can't wait till I make my first btc

Hah, cool if only I heard of Bitcoin earlier, I would have traded with you in an instant. Good luck man.

I would try their small virtual cookie option first to check it out. It seems legit since the prices are similar to fiat once converted.

Great articles, read a few of them over the past couple months.

So, whats special about the Raspberry Pi?

It could be any program... but very similar to iTunes in a sense to incorporate a music community focused around music &amp; bct

I understand your view, I've been their before. If I had a good amount of income I would be buying the songs and albums I enjoy because I like to support artists and also whenever I get better at mixing, I don't need to ever worry about the quality.

Yeah defiantly still worth it, thanks for the tips. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:06:36
Yeah, I knew that was the case... I just didn't want to hear it from other people hah. I might just scurvy up some cash and buy a btc to start off the market.

I did not know you can sell below one BTC hah... What website did you use to phurchase it?

Was it worth the mining gear? What is the estimated guess you think you make on a days of mining?

Great idea, I am looking forward to becoming a beta tester :), Sent you an email LeetCoinAdmin.

I am contemplating whether I should go all out and buy towers or hook up more laptops. The laptop I have now is only AMD 4250 and doesn't support OpenCL. It's lame how they have refurbished 43xx used chips instead of a AMD 4400.

I see nothing wrong with it. Put more detail in the background on the address side of the card and your set :)

Support the artist with bitcoins, if you like their music!
