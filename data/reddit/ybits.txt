You gave me an excuse to pull a [Schwarzenegger](  So thanks for making the mistake. ;)

What I'm saying is that bitcoin will be obstructed enough so that it will not have the utility it has now during a world war 3 scenario.  
You specifically said "If Bitcoin doesn't stop it, at least it will be able to adapt to it and give the people caught in it a few more tools to help survive it." and I am calling rubbish on that.
  
Bitcoin will not be able to help anyone during a world war 3 scenario.  Maybe looong afterwards it **might**, but during a world war 3 scenario it most assuredly will not be a tool to help anyone survive it.  Not in its current form.  The bitcoin network will be obstructed, probably forked in different regions of the world and the network will be in shambles.
  
Again, in a world war three scenario, anything that relies on the internet is not a safe bet at all.  If your job and your livelihood depends on it, you will likely suffer.

Rubbish.  Bitcoin will suffer tremendously if there is a WW3.  The internet as you know it will end, pipelines that cross borders will be severed, satellites blown out of the sky, and the free internet as you know it will come to and end.  And you will suffer greatly if you rely on it and be forced to participate in a different system if you want to survive.  Pray to whatever god you believe in that it's just high orbital nuclear explosions taking out your electronics and not low altitude instantly frying you to a crisp.

I think that's their *clever* way of saying "hodl".

We have a long way to go before there is that kind of redundancy.  Radio is an option but it would take another [Project West Ford]( to accomplish what you propose during a nuclear war and that is only temporary.  Mesh networks like you describe simply do not exist on the civilian level and again undersea cables and communications satellites would be some of the first to go.  In the event of a world war 3, you can bet your butt that [the internet kill switch will be used](

Why?  The point of physical bitcoins is to speculate on a collectable market.  BIP38 destroys the resale market, it has already been tried by Casascius and Titan Bitcoin.

I agree with this.  We have a lot of indirect evidence that suggests cash is not here to stay.  At least not in its current form that allows for anonymity.  We can see that our governments are working very hard to remove anonymity from financial exchange.  So it is reasonable to assume that they will get around to fixing the cash problem.  Cash will probably not disappear, but I think it will change to something more traceable as we move forward.

Tell me more about exactly how bitcoin is going to survive a [World War 3](  You haven't done that and there is plenty of material about warfare from which I can draw conjecture.

If you set up a merchant account with Bitpay or Coinbase, you can have it automatically converted to fiat for you.

This is great, I'm going to fax him a dickbutt.
