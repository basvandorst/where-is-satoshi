So why is it not 4 BTC instead of $1000?
It's like winning the lottery in Germany and it paying out in yen. Very silly.

Are you knocking new ways of protecting credit card numbers and PII or subtly calling out a weakness of bitcoin and an inferior technology that physical credit cards bypass?

Excellent point. However Circle didn't even have a privacy policy.. (Just checked:  they just added one Oct 22..
However, as far as that goes, it doesn't really tell you much. Very boiler-plate. 


Suggest actually asking for deleting your account and requesting removal of Personal Information. If there is a breach, and your info is part of it AND they shouldn't even still be storing that information... uggg.

While I agree with your sentiment, let's base our arguments on facts, ok?

Downloaded it. Overall, it comes across as very immature. 
* Only one page to look at in app store, not demonstrating any actual functionality, just the login page.
* Slider on mneumonic slow and I was able to break the GUI after 2-3 flips on it.
* Made my phone vibrate 4 times for no apparent reason during 1-4 step process.
* Unclear where username / password is being sent to (this is something you should make obvious)
* Terms of service link is unavailable that I need to agree to. (are you freaking kidding me?) and there is NO privacy policy.. so why should people create a login using email address?
As such, there isn't a lot of trust being built here, and apparently the developers also don't feel it is a product ready of being used at it is marked version 0.0.36. This comes across as being build by cowboys / web developers, not security professionals, which is what I expect from "The safer Bitcoin wallet".
so... tried it. Providing feedback so next version can fix these issues (as I see them).

A company can easily comply with the 5 year retention policy by migrating information to archival storage rather than keep it in production environment. You put eggs in multiple baskets if you care about defense in depth and customer privacy.
If it were me, I'd at a minimum want Circle to disable the account, with migration to off-line data store a high priority.

I've got your reason right here:
have 3 cents on me, aaRON_PAUL_420! @_date: 2014-11-20 19:46:56
. . .and nowhere is there a legitimate discussion on how it will affect price.
That said, have 1 dollar on me, BashCo! @_date: 2015-01-30 22:12:42
Ok, then I'll help you.. X out of 1000 transactions mysteriously fails. It's low volume, so the guy that is SOL is most likely not willing to pursue it. You have plausible deniability that the unique address you put on screen wasn't owned by you.. "sorry, buddy, no idea who you sent that BTC to"
 shows that you don't want to reveal who you are.. and you mention that you are "a couple guys from switzerland and the netherlands on hashtalk, but have a domain registered to a canadian.
When a company is PURPOSELY non-transparent about their business model and how to legally contact them, it is fair to put up a red flag and treat interactions with them cautiously.


Also, no mention of where that exchange rate is taken from. One may surmise that the "there is no exchange fee" is incorrect, it is hidden in the posted exchange rate. If it is based on a known exchange, why is that not transparent?
BTW, these things are all easily remedied. I question why they haven't. Maybe I should ask it again: what steps *have* you taken that earns any level of trust for me to send you any amount and hope you don't have a servers error and "forget" to pay me back?

Ok, I'll bite. I hereby claim I sent you 20000 bits and never received my Dogecoin. Now, the issue is, you can't easily refute that. Are you willing to open your books? I doubt it.  How do you know that one of your other partners didn't slip in (and later remove) code to pop in a personal QR code, then fail the transaction. You don't have the transparency to: code quality, code safety, guarantees. Additionally, because "desire privacy" you are not even putting your own reputation on the line.


That's your claim. If you were to "fail" entire transactions, you wouldn't make pennies, you'd make the entire amount sent to you. That means with a high volume, you have 99% happy customers, and 1% confused patrons who somehow lost their money.


Right, like I surmised, you are hiding an exchange fee in the price. Obviously, you have no problem coming out and saying it, but saying this same thing on the web page where the user can see it is demonstrating transparency. People have the choice of working with you knowing the cost they are paying for the convenience of your service. 
This is part of building trust.


No, I've already given you ways to build trust, and I'll list them here for your convenience:
* Have a transparent business model (we make a small bit on each transaction" instead of denying that there is an exchange fee... don't mince words, it truly is a fee you are charging your users)
* Have a freaking phone number instead of a (clearly) shared email address as your sole bit of contact information
* Don't ask for trust from others when you are unwilling to give them trust...
* Lay out your processes that support your policy of "refunding all failed transactions".. i mean, how do you go about doing that? Is it a manual process, where human error can be introduced, or is it automated and you have done thorough testing


I'm not as concerned about the security of the system (but again, you haven't demonstrated that you have individuals on staff that are qualified to write secure code) as I am that your business model is just a [Salami attack]( and there is a way for you to easily steal entire transactions with no recourse for the user, because you want your privacy. 
Wait, I AM concerned about the security of your system. Who's to say it's not trivial for an MTM to replace your posted QR codes with their own?
This all said, I am only attempting to point out where you can demonstrate a higher level of trust. I am not your target audience as I don't dally in alt coins. I do think that the industry as a whole can benefit by more mature attitudes regarding demonstrating trust to consumers rather than the parade of bad actors hurting the community (Mt. Gox, GAW, Robocoin, Butterfly Labs, etc. ).

Could someone explain why they should be trusted instead of treated like any of the mixer services that stole coins?

Unable to recover with a "not connected" process. Ended up deleting and re-installing. Sync was fine but stalled several times.

If Linus never came up with Linux, there were still the *BSDs that were quite as capable. 
In fact, quite a large bit of what you are calling Linux is in fact BSD as corporations do not need to worry about releasing changes back to the community as the license doesn't require it.

I'm not sure that "unlimited blocksize" is the BU argument. I interpret it as literally "take the block size limitation out of the code". There are clearly other forces at work that would limit the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:07:51
Are you saying that core code is exploit free?
If the reverse were true, would you say to use BU code!? That seems pretty unreasonable and, well, panicky.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:31:19


Ok, so when they do get their shit together it's ok to use their code?
Do you now see why I think your response was stupid? It certainly doesn't seem to jive with your position.
It makes your entire message chicken little (and therefore easily dismissed) rather than sounding well informed and well-reasoned.

Simple to use. I am absolutely recommending this for iOS users.
Good job, Mike.
