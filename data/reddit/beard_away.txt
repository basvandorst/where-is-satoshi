Let's say you have all your coins on your ledger, and you keep it in a safe place. You're watching the market and you want to cash out on some at a given notice. However, You are about an hour away from your ledger. Then the market dips again.
I assume you just lose out on that sell?

Totally forgot this one existed, thanks for the reminder. Just have to wait for the dip to cum.

Haha, no it is not. It's somewhere in Europe though.

If you don't mind me asking, how much do you pay for a safe box at a bank, and how do they determine how much it's fully insure for?

If you get this, I'll send a little something over to you wallet!

I've seen someone with the "Y!" tattoo once before, was hoping it'd be you.

Thanks for your reply, very helpful.
In regards to question 2, what I am not understanding is the "Order type" and the "price"
What I mean by the price, it seems like I can enter my own price.. 
For example, if I do order type: Limit and price 500USD, it shows 2.6901 BTC
But BTC is much higher currently than that..

This makes a lot more sense now. I greatly appreciate it!

Thank you for this info, greatly appreciated!
What do you personally think about the ETF being approved?
