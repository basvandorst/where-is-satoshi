The subtle message is he’s going crazy all the while.
I’ve made a poor investment I lost my shirt on (-$50k+) and I recognize the same hysteria I was going through, in people who’re holding Bitcoin for profit.

I saw these type of hype posts while losing thousands in a solar company. I’m grateful for that experience, it helped me avoid bitcoin and keep avoiding it at the moment.
How would an Ad in a magazine help reinforce the idea of purchasing this product, really?
Edit - I struggle to choose which hype thread to post in... they’re literally all just trying to convince themselves their investment is smart, and people watching will see this mass positivity and invest without REAL research on the subject.

I compared Bitcoin to SunEdison, too many people think Bitcoin IS crypto, but crypto doesn’t need Bitcoin to succeed to have a future you know.
And at any rate, I compared the overall atmosphere of when SUNE was going down, to how people are acting in here, nothing to do with the company itself but the people who are left with the losses.

This “collective” that you become a slave to... is honestly the group of pushers that seem to be in desperation mode here. I rode SunEdison down after it dropped from $33/share to $8, eating up all the garbage people posted about them winning this contract, and delivering this solar project... in the end it went belly up.
Do not take this advice to buy now. Step back and detach emotionally before you invest, and you’ll see bitcoin is on its way down still. Your red flag was when your buddies came to you with a “way to make a big return on investment” without knowing what the hell the value it even added. You’ve missed the hype train if you want to get in right now, basically just the bag holders who’re “hodling”.
I feel for you boys tho, $70k in losses in an industry I believed in (renewables) and from the company in talks to purchase the one I managed for. The self brainwashing was so strong, I hyped myself over each hype post I saw instead of thinking with clarity.

Not sure if you replied to me, or about the main post? I’m guessing the main thread post, which could make sense.
