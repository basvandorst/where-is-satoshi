lol, based on what I understand, 21 million club = 1 BTC (only 21 million people can own a single BTC, so you're one of 21 million).

There were over 4,400 buy orders vs 200 sell orders at $3.1k - with blue sky sell orders above. I went to purchase market right as $3.1k or $3k (forget which) broke seeing BCH explode on Kraken and somehow got caught at $6k mark for a small buy... then was unable to place order during the period of insane volatility, trapped. You could only use market orders to buy and not sell - the only method of selling was to post - but the trades were too rapid to adjust for (is this common practice when introducing a new coin for Coinbase? or was it a trap?). Shouldn't have attempted to trade on a phone today, but I won't lose more than $100 unlike some other unlucky souls that likely got completely screwed over.

$15k mark is starting to go up :/ 
Looks like tide is starting to turn.

I want to Yolo to reach the 21 million club, but can't...bring... myself to do it. Must protect gainz. That and I keep trying to buy, but price is flying too fast! 
Choked out at $9,700 after whales sold during $10k spike and drop, back to 42 million club for now. 
It's odd because I believe it gets to $20k and eventually $50k :/

I'm happy with any gain as the money previously sat in a checking account gaining nothing for 8 years. Oy vey...
This is just a bet for the future with excess cash that isn't needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:08
I bought in at 5-6k and sold at 9.7 - I regert'd it as I continued buying back as it rose. A correction is likely coming SOMETIME lol, so it's up to your own personal risk tolerance. There is nothing wrong with holding back initial investment and keeping the excess skin in game. I'm hopeful it eventually reaches 100k someday and at the least 25-50k

Thanks, PNWReddit2 mentioned above. Based on website I linked it appears 3.5% should be fine (96% of the time you end up adding money to principal over the long-run).

Get away from me with your AIDS! 
lol, jk. Yea yea. If I had a couple million and Billy Mays was still alive, the things we could accomplish... c'est la vie.

Just being conservative ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:52:24
3.5%? 
If he paid 20% taxes on $1.8M, looking at $50,400. If he continued working for another 10-15 years and creates a budget (focuses more on learning finances) while 1) paying off house with interest and withdrawals, 2) adding to 401k/IRA/retirement he'd hopefully be back up to $1.8M and the $72K number (with no more mortgage payments yay!) in his early 40's.

Is this a "nation" vs "state" thing. Kurdistan would technically be called a nation, but not state (geographical borders/one government/etc.)?

The moon obviously.

If he sold all of his BTC and put the $1.8M in Vanguard indexed funds (what many there suggest with large sums of money) and you expected a conservative 6% return on those funds... he could pull out $108K/year ($86,400 @ 20% tax depending on tax situation - country) without touching the principal. 
There are many good suggestions on here. If I were in his shoes, I'd pull out a quarter or a half and go the indexed funds route with that. The rest I would hold for $10-25K levels years down the road (IF I really believe BTC will grow that way). I would continue working and accruing interest without spending any of the money with exception to paying a down payment on a cheap house ($300K-400K seems fine in his circumstances). If going the quarter route, the interest each year should pay for the monthly mortgage. Paying the mortgage with interest should allow his wife to explore other avenues for work. 
If the OP is real, he is set for life. If he lives a conservative lifestyle and only spends what he needs with 2 vacations or so a year, he doesn't really need to work if he moves to low COL area. I would suggest continuing to work though and letting the money continue to grow.

lol, I'm going to delete this post if there is another response :)
It was one option to diversify and I was giving a simple response. With that much money he should talk with a financial adviser. I use Vanguard and like it.

Well he bought it before he was married... and I can only think of all the arguments that would have been had had he told her earlier.
If there is trust in the marriage, I don't think he should have a hard time breaking the news (at least I hope not).

Someone heavily involved in bitcoin and that has access to much moolah should put out an ad campaign during holidays :) Give the gift of bitcoin! I decided this year to start contributing $20 every birthday for nieces and nephews + $5 for holidays. Plan is to give it to them at 18 - hopefully Bitcoin reigns supreme in crypto in two decades. 
I think there are many parts to why a large majority of people won't buy. Volatility, widespread adoption, cost/btc, etc. I think the largest reason is lack of understanding.

Dang, y'all killing me haha. 
Yerp, if you assume let's say 2.2% inflation over 50 years, that 72k is split into a third of current value. If hyperinflation were to occur (he's not in US, not sure of what happens worldwide) outlook is even worse. If it were me, I'd continue working until I was 55-60 regardless of the pot I have. I know there are people that could live off the lump sum, but I wouldn't personally feel safe or not want to work. If he is keeping half of the 200 BTC and it takes off to $25K he'll be fine. There are a lot of variables. I'd just suggest 1) living normally, 2) learning to budget, 3) diversifying 1/2 or 1/4 into less volatile investment, and 4) evaluating again in 10 years to see where he is at (while using what he has earned through his investment to pay mortgage so he can save money and allow wife to pursue dream job/find something she loves to do for a career even if it pays less). I'd expect his salary to increase somewhat over the next 10 years and be able to add to retirement if he budgets appropriately. 
I'm sure some of the people over at FI would also talk about diversifying and buying additional real estate as well to rent. And I'm sure many could live on that $1.8M.

Started buying after JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs claimed it was scam :) Thanks for lower entry guys! Buying up into $7000's. Waiting for next drop to finally have 1 BTC!

Conspiracy theory - Wall Street is propping it up to drop it like a rock and end it. 
Only problem is there is too much money now and it is too resilient.
