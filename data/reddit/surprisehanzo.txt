I agree, fuck Hanzo. Long live Reindhart.

Oh right. I understand now.

Is it possible to have a sell order at a value lower than what it’s currently worth and not have it be filled straight away?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:21:02
The people who were posting memes probably sold during that last dip.

I think milestones should be in $5k increments.

Australia. In USD those numbers I mentioned would be sold at $10950 and now it’s at $15560.

Also did the same. Sold at $14,500 AUD thinking it was almost at the peak and was going to dip. But then it kept rising and kept rising and I just kept waiting and it’s now sitting at $20,700. Now to buy back that same amount that I sold it’s going to cost almost double what I sold it for.

Haha I read your comment and thought that you did. All good, everyone’s entitled to an opinion.
@_date: 2018-10-08 10:04:34
I feel personally attacked.

I was hesitant about posting that link to the number plates cause it has a mobile number and name but it’s all public information so who cares I guess. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:48:08
I can’t speak for the other guy that mentioned the plates being for sale. But I saw this car in a private apartment building car park and posted the photo to reddit. Not everything is a conspiracy lol.

“Clearly”. Honestly I couldn’t care less if some millionaire sells his number plates.
Although maybe if he sells them now he’ll give me some commission haha.

You’re right.

I also need BTC. I think 4 or 5 should do.

I would recommend downloading bread wallet instead. Mycelium isn't good for iOS and has very high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:53:37
Yeah might not even take that long

In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony FUD. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence.
