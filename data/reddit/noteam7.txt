This is hilarious coming from a sheep. Bitcoin is still historically at a 200% positive gain pattern. Because even though it loses 80%, it's always after a 1000% growth. So even if you bought at the all time high within 4 years historically you're back to the money you put in, meanwhile that same value in fiat has lost 4 exponential decreases of 8% in value through those years. So yeah, keep your money in the dollars sheep. It was designed to keep you working till your death bed as perpetual debt slaves. So keep your money there sheep. It's ironic how projective you are of the dollar you so blindly follow without paying attention to it's enslavement of you by taxing your savings through inflation.

Fiat has dropped 99% of it's value since it's inception, and never gained any value back through it. Btc has lost 80% of it's value 3 times, all right before jumping 1000%, therefor still having profited 200% before the thousand percent jump. So yeah, I'll stick to the one that jumps 1000% and holds a 200% increase in value after that jump versus the one that loses 99% of it's value in 80 years. That's 1 lifetime. That's 15 years into retirement where everything you saved to live you last days on is not even enough to get you a burger. So congrats to all the babyboomers who saved 50k all their lives to retire on, it will only get them through a year.

Yup, fucking wallstreet is terrified of crypto, so they've stuck they're digital army to attempt and say the publics opinion through obvious misinformation comments. Probably the same guys they have doing it for the elections. You can see their accounts frequent both.

Do you know what you're talking about? You can easily google and confirm what he's saying. There are about 5 billionairs doing lectures on this daily. If you were Jeff Bezos would you keep 100 billion in cash to lose 8 billion dollars in value of purchasing power every year?

That's why those companies are crashing in value. Also, most countries only hold dollars because the US has deals with Oil nations to only sell their oil for US dollars. So other companies must buy dollars to buy oil from said places. Shit the reason we had the iraq war was because Iraq was trying to start and sell their oil for euro's. So we killed those in charge and put in our own puppets to keep the old ways. Because without those deals, the US dollar would collapse in value overnight. Billionaires also preach about not keeping your money in the dollar. Shit some of them have Tai lopez style buisnesses out of that whole preaching.

By giving them the facts? And that's 2000 years of failed fiat currencies with an average lifespan of 27 years. Our current currency is only 100 years old. It's a new non gold backed dollar created in 1913. 100 years of life and it's lost 99% of it's value and is only increasing in the pace of this value lost. Why are you purposely trying to make people ignore the facts and hold onto an asset that is only losing value faster and faster as the debt and money printing speeds increase? You going to deny the facts that we're 21 trillion in debt now causing us to pick up the printing speed? The fact that our president is replacing the heads of the feds with people who will print money faster as he's already been telling the current fed leaders for 2 years now?

Los angeles homes are about those prices so maybe there. Go back to the 1930's though and the houses were in fact 6k there too. Go to the 1970's and you had 30k houses. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:38:22
The same is happening everywhere else. You can find a 100k home in kuntucky but your average income will be about 30k a year. Before taxes. So same story of out of range housing to median income. The numbers don't matter, it's the ratio difference pricing it out of everyones hands but buisness hands. Keep this up and every property will become an aibnb or rental property. Only family owned homes will be vacation homes for the owners of those rentals

Dude, there are article and billionairs preaching this openly. Are you really that ignorant? Someone like Jeff Bazo's keeping his 100 billion in cash would be subjecting it to lose 8 billion in purchasing power a year by holding it in the 8% inflationary cash. I swear so many of you it's almost as if your part of the militaries social army program trying to give people misinformation here.

200% gains every 4 years. If you want to go 10 years then it's at over a million percent gains. I will never take a loan for it though since I don't want to put myself in a position where I'd have to sell. I'll just keep stacking up through my income and keep it as a sort of savings account should I ever need it.

You mean the guy who ran away with 250 mill with a new identity? Yeah it went horrible for him right. Must be so shitty living in his new mansion under a new name. I'd hate to be him. Great example of how bad crypto is for someone by pointing to someone who just got the fucking life of a king by running away with other people crypto. This is why we say not your keys not your crypto. This is also why the real holders only have 1% in exchanges, and 99 percent in hard cold wallets unconnected from the internet.

If that happened I'd be so happy. I'm not waiting tho. Last time I waited for a dip I missed out way too much.

Who the fuck did this!?!?! I was so close to my goal ������ 
Edit: Just did the math. If we're in a bull market and 3100 was our all time low since the 20k ath, then the last drops from the growths since then are 19% and 10%. So the next low can be anywhere from 4100 to 4500, anywhere withing 11 days to 22 days till the next low to hit before another run starts climbing back to 5k. Again, this is all if we're in a bull market. If we're not and this has all been one long fake pump, and 3100 isn't our all time low since to 20k jump, then throw this all out the window lol.  Also if 5100 isn't our new ath since the 3100 drop then the next bottoms will have to be adjusted.

Oh shit. The Iraq war was for this exact situation. Don't be surprised if there's another attack that gets us in another war. The dollar for oil trade is a very big part of our dollars price illusion. If that ends, countries stop having to buy dollars to buy oil. Ending a huge influx on why other countries buy dollars putting value behind it. Would cause a major economic collapse. I don't expect the fed to let that happen without trying to overthrow them and put a knew regime in charge that will comply. It's what happened last time with iraq.

They were buried in a years long trip of being high daily. I thought I had lost them honestly, but then my bitcoin addiction unlocked them in my head. Though it can't predict the dates of things, just potential ranges from historical data.

Good luck kidnapping them. As a redditor yourself I'm sure you know we have no loved ones. We traded them all in long ago for our true love, bitcoin.

I admit it's true too. But what I hate is people neglecting it having grown 1000% just a few months prior. Making the real difference 100% growth from the previous boom not shortly before the drop. Making a realistic 100% growth after the drop. Cause let's be honest, if it doesn't hold an ath for longer than 2 months then it doesn't really count from an analytic perspective. The amount of people who bought at ath's is small compared to those who buy for the majority of the time when it's at normal levels.
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:32:07
You say that, yet we live in world today where it is constantly evolving because of peoples wishes. Get enough people to see, and the way we do things will change to the wishes of the masses. Like weed. Was illegale for decades, until everyone had a voice and demanded change. Now we have more weed legal states than not. Soon to be legal once the boomers lose their vote to the younger generations as they keep aging in to vote. That same generation that wishes to legalize is also avidly watching bitcoin.

Me too. It's still great but not as good as it was before they bought them. Ever since they bought them I've noticed waze taking me on less efficient routes than google maps.
