Fair enough, but any time I ever talk to anyone that doesn't know a thing about economics, it tends to be easier to explain things in terms of price levels, because it is something they are familiar with in their daily lives.
Otherwise, I am left having to explain production possibilities frontiers and marginal exchange and etc etc etc. Ain't nobody got time for that when they're just going to say, "HA TROLL" at the end of it.

The idea of the technological singularity is just another form of religion. It actually doesn't appear to be supported in reality - you can't have infinite computing power (which is implied in the idea of the singularity) without infinite POWER, and the limits of physics prevent this from being a reality.
Human society will exist in a similar manner as ours until 1) we develop a method to travel the stars, or 2) we blow ourselves up (or some similar life-terminating event).

There's no reason BTC would ever be illegal. I still have no clue why anyone around here thinks it would be. Trust me, the government isn't afraid it's going to come around and destroy the USD, despite what everyone here thinks. Using BTC to deal in drugs and hitmen will, however, put you out of business.
This story just cements the fact that BTC is a commodity, not a currency - the US Gov't doesn't sell off dollars seized at auction.

That 1% fee that is dissuading the person from using bitcoin in this manner is a market force, and their utility is affected by it, thus, they get more utility through the use of other currencies than bitcoin.

No, it would be best if you paid in the inflationary currency and left the deflationary currency alone. The inflationary currency is LOSING value, so paying with that means you keep MORE of the deflationary currency which is GAINING value which increases your purchasing power in the future.
This is really simple arithmetic, and I suck at math and even get this part of it...


Yeah, so why would you use deflationary currency to pay off a debt in inflationary currency, when you have inflationary currency to pay the debt off with?

How do you figure? Are you assuming humans don't develop technology to counteract the negatives of technology? These economists you criticize do a lot of work figuring out how to counter that, actually. You can have growth and invest in technology to counter any negatives from growth, as well as create incentives through market regulation to "naturally" steer people away from negative externalities, as well as properly price positive externalities (education, etc). The problem with applying economics to systems generally stems from politics and/or an intellectually lazy or willfully ignorant population who just listen to whatever politician they "feel" is best for the job and whatever he/she says.

This, in so many ways. This is why inflation targeting is even a thing - deflation can become unwieldy and limits the possible options to monetary corrections needed to maintain stability, and can spiral out of control.
As a matter of fact, moderate inflation is GOOD for smaller investors, as their debt is essentially lessened over time, giving them extra room, statistically, to work with, versus those who hold large amounts of financial wealth and feel an incentive to "reinvest" it, if you will, in non-monetary holdings.
Small businesses and regular individuals rarely if ever feel inflation (other than hyperinflation, obviously, but those are definitely completely different from either normal levels of inflation as well as any type of deflation) because they do not hold the amount of assets that large firms and the extremely wealthy hold. Their moneys come in, their moneys go out, all well within a time frame where inflation is not felt.
Holding cash is horrible for an economy. Moderate savings is acceptable, preferably in the form of investments of some nature, but no-risk returns ruin economies.

That is absolute BS.
First, and I know this from first-hand experience, if you deposit money that day (in the form of a check that requires a couple days to clear, for instance), it will be counted toward your balance. This is concerning debit/checking accounts, of course. As long as the check or payment clears, you will not be issues any overdraft fee.
At the worst financial status of my life, I hovered just above the overdraft line. In the double-plus-worst financial status, I dropped into overdraft territory and payed hundreds of dollars total in overdraft fees, due to my own stupidity and financial negligence. Since then, I have learned the system, and it does not work in the way you just said it does, so you, sir/madam, are actually lying.

That would not hold up in court, as banks are regulated and comply with certain procedures in an effort to curb money laundering. When they fail, they get in trouble, according to laws that are passed, and then are expected to fix the problem.
The Silk Road was open about its activities, it wasn't trying to comply with any laws at all. That's why it wouldn't hold in court. And the hitmen stuff... Uncle Sam can look the other way on certain things if the group is clever enough (usually drugs), but murder is a big no-no to the feds.

No, I am saying you need the monopolization of violence to stop the widespread use of violence. Once monopolization occurs, wherever the monopolization is seen as legit, violence plummets - case in point, America, where we don't have death squads roaming around killing whole towns. Contrast this with places with weak states, such as Darfur, or many places in sub-Saharan Africa, Somalia, many places in Central America, and any resources available (diamonds, fresh water, farmland) shortly becomes contested by entities using violence as a means to power. This isn't some big mystery and I am making very clear points, don't try and say I am making arguments I am not when it is clear from past posts I have said no such thing.

So, what you are saying is, as a seller, you don't want the ability to allow consumers protection from fraud or theft so that you can make one more sale in the entire course of your selling things?
Let me just clarify: You make two points as to why it's good for you as a seller - that you don't have to hold on to it (ha, lots of faith in it, I see), and that you don't get charge backs. And one of these points is pretty much meaningless, because it only happened once to you and it was clearly an event where the consumer got the short end. And the other benefit of why it isn't inferior is that you can just convert it easily to some other form of currency.

Well, Western Union owns about 15% of the market share in its industry, and transfer firms transfer about $50B/yr total, so that means Western Union transfers about $7.5B/yr. I just don't get how bitcoin replaces these, when you take into account the painful nature of having to 1) create an exchange account to get cash, 2) worry about whether the exchange will get hacked/not follow proper security protocol and you'll lose your bitcoin or cash from whatever account is attached to the exchange account when it is compromised, 3) worry whether an exchange will run off with your money or bitcoin, etc. There's more downside than just "it takes ten minutes to verify".
And the price of bitcoin can go down or up. If it were pegged to some value that was stable, I could see it making a lot of sense. But, what happens if you go to buy some bitcoin to transfer to someone, transfer it to them, and a day later, it's down x%. That x% might as well be an operating cost for a transfer service - except no one holding stock is getting paid dividends for this % "charge".
And, if the price keeps going up, as is often argued, it will eventually crash hard. That is the nature of things that always go up, eventually they come down.
I dunno. I just don't see much benefit, it seems very risky (lots of posts online about lost bitcoin) for what little problems it solves. At first I was like "Oh this is cool," but as time has passed I am less convinced than ever it will be anything other than a curiosity to the masses (huge hurdle for adoption, large risk factor, and already gaining negative mainstream connotations from silk road/black market/wikileaks endorsement when looking at it from a PR/marketing standpoint) and as a minor payments processing tool for a minimal audience that does business exclusively online.

Wow, I never refused to recognize that, you've just refused to provide any sort of detailed alternative to the status quo. The burden of proof isn't on me here, you made the initial claim that removal of state would solve the violence problem, when it will only open up avenues for more groups to use violence to enforce their will. THAT is what you refuse to recognize - you think that by removing the state, or so it seems, most violence would cease, when in actuality, history generally shows the reverse to be the case.
Even in pre-Industrial times of limited communication and transportation, violence was commonplace, on a per capita basis. The Noble Savage is a fallacy.

An "unregulated market" could be any market existing without legal regulation along the spectrum of purely free competitive market to a monopoly. Just because one removes all regulation from a market does not imply the market will be a free market.
A "free market" is a subset of an unregulated market which requires certain prerequisites to exist, which are pretty much impossible to achieve in reality (perfect information, no costs of entry into market, no firms are large enough to set market price (they are "price takers"), etc).
In reality, the concept of a "monopolistic competitive market" is the "free market" people usually are talking about, but it's hardly free. It is the market you think of when you think of McDonald's competing with Taco Bell, local competing grocery stores, jewelers in a mall, Amazon versus Overstock, etc. A "branded free market" in a way, although, once again, it is not free, as that is pretty much an impossibility, to the point where if you ever take a course on market structures, your professor will struggle to think of an example of a free market, and will have to make one up - because they don't exist.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:47:28
I take issue with your last point, and half of the second point.
Concerning the half of the second point I take issue with, "all that matters" being the protocol itself, is inaccurate. What drives a significant amount of bitcoin exchange is swapping for USD or other fiat currency in an effort to short and gain a profit. This is a much larger element of the exchange than businesses using it as a primary means of exchange - and most businesses convert it immediately to fiat, thus not proving to me in any way (objectively) that it is fairly valued. This also reduces the effect of the deflationary nature of bitcoin. This will be a big problem if it were to ever gain truly widespread adoption (a large percent of exchanges would have to be bitcoin, and it is nowhere near that right now). I do agree the protocol is a very useful piece of technology.
The third point I also take issue with, for much of the same reason I stated above. While there is some incentive for actors within countries experiencing financial crisis to use bitcoin due to its increasing value against their national currency (it is probably more stable, or at least not experiencing hyperinflation, which is absolutely disastrous to economies), there is minimal reason for actors in developed nations with minimal or non-existant financial crisis to adopt it in any way other than as a means to gain short term profits against a stable currency. These businesses convert immediately to USD or another fiat currency once the transaction is complete, at least large businesses - small individual ownerships may keep their balance in BTC due to their faith in the protocol, they still pay their bills in fiat, and rely on the stability of fiat currency to create some level of normality in their day-to-day dealings with others. Stability, in this sense, is a generally stable level of inflation - inflation would be horrible and crippling to the economy if it were to swing many percentage points over short periods of time. A stable level of inflation by macroeconomists is generally accepted to be somewhere in the ballpark of 1-3% (and many organizations that work off of [inflation targeting]( generally take 2% as an ideal, stable amount - not enough to hurt the average individual, as they spend their money fast enough that inflation does not affect them, and just enough to encourage large capital holders to invest and allow these investments a chance at growth and increasing productivity).
You are missing a larger point - through most of recorded history, currencies were backed by precious metals, and technological progress moved at a snail's pace. When technology started to create demands on money systems that the money systems couldn't handle (increased demand for money), we had to abandon things such as the gold standard, as it was wreaking havoc on economic growth - the growth being created due to increased specialization of actors and increased productivity of said actors due to increased human and technological capital.
Most of human history is agrarian economies. Those are completely different from post-industrial, service-based economies and required different demands on money systems.

Ticketmaster's business model is to BE unpopular so venues can get larger ticket sales easier, and consumers can blame Ticketmaster instead of the venues/etc.
Comcast is essentially a monopolistic or at least a firm sharing an oligopoly-type situation, and the infrastructure needed to do what it does is impossible to compete against (unless you're a parallel tech giant with large amounts of capital and connections, like google, for instance).

My talking points in discussions like this always revolve around the concept that there is really no legitimate answer to the problem of legislating decisions upon a population. It requires certain assumptions to even have the discussion, and usually the discussion falls apart in the assumptions.
Your assumptions (for the ideal legislation solution to the problem of democracy, at least - I am making the assumption that you're not in favor of dictatorship or monarchy or whatever else is out there as an alternative) appear to be that all members of a population must agree on legislation for it to be valid. Which is simply not feasible, since you can't possibly get a small group of people to agree to anything, let alone a larger population.
I can't spend too much time on this topic right now as I actually have to do something, but I do want to mention something about this:


There is actually a logic here, believe it or not. Assuming the people that CAN vote have proper information and access to voting, those who do NOT vote do not care enough about the issue in any of the directions presented. This means that, for all intents and purposes, their vote is best left out of the tally, as they would just skew the results in a manner that distorts the desire of those who would choose a piece of legislation, or who is to be elected, etc.
Now, this also requires the assumption that the choices given actually reflect all the desires of any importance, and there is definitely an argument to be made that most of the time, they don't.
I'll try and get back to this when I have time. But it's really a huge topic and obviously there is no answer, as the answer depends on what people want to happen. Is it just the majority opinion we are concerned with? Is it the least hated outcome we want? Is it the most desired? Is it something else? These ideas are somewhere near the heart of the matter, and I've realized that since I can't write a book, I haven't actually said anything. So maybe later I can illuminate why we are doing what we are doing in a representative republic (not saying it is even optimal, however).

Experimental economics has shown that human biases and heuristics create (sometimes gross) inefficiencies in purely "free" markets. Denying experimental results is the height of ignorance.

I'm pretty sure the answer is that there is a difference between transferring money without a license (possible laundering, if you are legit and profitable you will be comfortable obtaining a license, if you are not legit or not profitable, you won't be getting a license more than likely) and selling goods.
If you're a gold coin seller, you're going to have a license. Same with regular currency or money transfers. These are laws designed to prevent easy money laundering and give authorities the capacity to at least get investigations (if needed to find out the crime the laundering happened around) when these things happen.

I have actually grown anti-crypto after seeing the debate around here for too long. So I guess you aren't far off. I actually want solutions to problems, and this type of stuff isn't a solution and so far appears to only have encouraged the anarchists to think they're actually doing something useful for humanity (why exactly, I am not sure, as the benefits aren't really anything special IMO).


I'm not concerned with legality - as a matter of fact, I regularly tell people around here that no court in the US has made bitcoin illegal, so why they'd think it's illegal to deal in bitcoin is beyond me (I often see the whole paranoid/conspiratorial "THE BANKS ARE BUYING COURTS OUT" stuff around here about bitcoin). It IS illegal to launder money and to buy drugs and hitmen with anything, however.


I also don't buy this. Yeah, merchants join the network, but there aren't really any stats when they drop OFF the network, either, showing an inflated number. As for new wallets, since they're not a one-to-one with individuals, I don't see how that's a useful metric, either.
I do not buy into crypto. At first I was intrigued, and then I just saw a lot of hype and a lot of defense of things that I see no reason, ethically or logically, to defend, and it's all been in the name of some cryptocurrency which, as far as I can tell, is less useful in reality than most make it out to be.


I don't know, that's not my job to decide. But it has no protections on it, and any entity can just make a copy of it and use it themselves in their own activities. The proof-of-work stuff might turn out to be useful. But the current way it is dealt with, as a speculative good with price fluctuations, that stuff will eventually cause its collapse - don't know when, but it will definitely fall one day, and that will crush it.
If it were pegged to USD or some other currency, it would probably be far more successful.

Here's a point that seems to be missed in this discussion all the time:
Those who develop the protocol become the new "man". If you expect bitcoin to be adopted by the vast majority of people, the vast majority of people have just as much say in bitcoin as they do in any other system in existence today. So, it's not really much of an anarchist ideal, since it requires certain amounts of a specific type of human capital just to understand it let alone influence it as an individual "working freely" within the system.

Well, foreign currencies would probably be sold on an exchange for USD. But there is no official or truly "legal" exchange for BTC (and Mt Gox is on Uncle Sam's bad side right now, so that is probably out of the question for them to easily gain some legal standing to be counted as an exchange), so they will more than likely be auctioned in small amounts to individuals or organizations interested in purchasing them.

Working until you can afford a house is horrible, actually - does a family raise children in a small apartment? To get the same living space for children in an apartment, you generally are going to make monthly payments of twice the amount of a mortgage, and this will take away spending of the family unit from things like education and extracurriculars, all of which have been shown to be strongly correlated (probably even causing, but I don't have a source handy) general levels of future success in life for the child. Not to mention the fact that by the time one COULD purchase a home, after spending money to live as well as paying rent (which people will never get back, unlike home payments in the case of possibly selling in the future if the family were to move), a household of 4 would take probably twenty years to purchase a home - the kids would be gone by then.

How has it not been proven for bitcoin? The way it appears to me, bitcoin doesn't suffer from this problem in a macro sense because it isn't being used in a macro sense. If it were to become the only currency used, the deflation effect from it would cripple whatever economy it was the primary actor in. As it stands, the deflationary aspect of bitcoin is just allowing those who wish to make profits in USD the capacity to do so (i.e., bitcoin is borrowing the stability of another currency to counteract the negative deflationary and inherently unstable aspects of itself).

This is realistically feasible, but politically impossible.


This is unrealistic, as unrestricted free markets generally end in a monopoly, especially in cases of large infrastructure needing to exist for a business to function (police could possibly work in this type of system, but courts and military would more than likely need a large infrastructure to function effectively... as a matter of fact, military certainly needs a large infrastructure just to compete with all other state-run militaries).
Plus, how would you even enforce a free-market military? What if every other home in the country paid for Military X, and every other home paid for Military Y? A foreign power invades, and then what?
Not to mention, in cases of markets with positive externalities (police, courts, military), private funding is generally under what is socially necessary/optimal.

I would take neither spirals. The benefit of a stable, small rate of inflation is that it is predictable and offers ways of maintaining its predictability. The downside of a small rate of deflation, even if stable, is that if it becomes unstable, there are limited options for dealing with it before it becomes a spiral. That is why the "zero lower bound" is so scary to those concerned with economies, because it means an approach to a dangerous level of inability to control deflation once it starts.

If a price is climbing, that would be evidence of inflation - for instance, buying a McDonald's hamburger today is more expensive in terms of USD than buying one in the 1950s, due to inflation.
In the same vein, buying something today that was worth more in the past can be evidence of deflation.
This is why bitcoin is currently deflationary, at least in terms of fiat currencies. The value of BTC is rising in regards to USD (in general), but I think it is yet to be proved that it is deflationary due to increased demand of BTC and decreased demand of goods purchased with BTC. My personal theory is this is because it is traded like a speculative good for real-world currencies. My other theory is that it will remain deflationary even if trade for real world currencies was ruled out, and especially so when the BTC limit is reached.

Dude. Please. Go live your life. You're not some genius revolutionary who is going to change the world. You're just some guy (girl?) online who, through the magic of technology, much like everyone else, thinks the world will somehow magically change because of visionaries like you. Meanwhile, throughout the entirety of recorded human history, the same structures keep repeating themselves - large states, empires, building up, falling down, over and over. Why? Because that is the nature of humanity.
You will never change it. It will always exist. You can sit here and think that for some reason these little baubles you have that glow in your face are somehow actually revolutionary, but they're not. Your utopia will never happen. Large systems are ugly and ultimately inefficient compared to the human imagination, but they actually exist. Quit feeding into the narcissism of the modern age, where you think for some reason you're all geniuses. You're not. The system is a system far greater than any one person or group of people and it will continue to roll on forever until the earth is dead or humans have blown themselves up.
Common defense doesn't happen in a large society. The free rider problems grows too great. You could never get enough people on board to mount an effective defense against larger, more organized neighboring states - and in the modern age, everyone is a neighbor. Quit thinking you can make huge things that require hierarchies to exist to somehow work without a coherent structure. That's such a childish mentality and is completely divorced from the real world and the entire human historical record. The historical record shows time and again that the most organized groups conquer the least organized. Empires are organized. Decentralization is not and fractures continually. Case in point - the USA beating the hell out of the decentralized tribal peoples of pretty much everywhere we step foot. Sure, we lose some PR battles, but in the overall power and violence sector, we win because of organization. You will not replace this with a decentralized system without any inherent authority.
Quit acting like children.
EDIT: How do you crowd source a nuke? An aircraft carrier? Who determines who pays for it? This shit doesn't just spontaneously create itself. And if you think the whole world will somehow magically lay down their arms and get along, you're wrong. Someone, somewhere, will seize the opportunity in your weakness, conquer you, and you will regret the day you ever thought you were clever enough to engineer a decentralized answer to pure power and central authority driving others to action.
EDIT2: What I am trying to say is, fix the system. Don't try and destroy it, because it will crush you. Don't try and circumvent it, because it will catch you and make you pay for your avoidance of it. Just make it efficient and correct. That is all that must happen. Accept it as the inevitability of nature, that large systems build upon smaller systems continually, and that, since the large system is inevitable, you should accept it like you accept gravity and develop your inovations to work in accordance with it. It's not evil, just like jumping off of a cliff expecting you can fly but falling to your death doesn't make gravity evil. It only becomes evil as people disengage from it and it asserts itself upon them to prove that it exists. Work with it, fix it, use it to make things right, because if you ignore it, it will eat everything. You will watch this happen as large banks and government entities eat your little pet project bitcoin alive if you remain adamant that it will somehow dismantle or disrupt them - it won't, they're bigger, they're stronger, and decentralization does not hold a candle against slow, methodical power structures. You can either incorporate and slightly improve the system in the slow manner it might improve, or you can resist - but the structure will remain in some manner, and the opposing force will be destroyed just if through no other way than sheer time and frustration with trying to compete with the beast.

Isn't the whole libertarian/anarchist/austrian school ethos centered around actions and not words? If so, Reagan talked a big game, but ran up a hell of a deficit during his term, more than any president before him. Amounts they all ran us into debt:

Reagan: -$1412B
Bush Sr: -$1030B
Clinton: +$63B (the rarest of rares - a surplus)
Bush Jr: -$3294B
Obama: -$5073B
Although honestly these numbers can't be directly compared, as GDP has changed so drastically.

That's pretty much the short of it.
There is a concept called the [multiplier]( While generally applied to fractional reserve banking (the "Money Multiplier") due to the effect of one dollar initially invested equating to however many dollars being created that can be loaned out, you can apply the same thinking to just about any economic activity, including using bitcoins. Consider the following scenarios:
John and Mike have 20 bitcoins each. John and Mike also have businesses where they sell goods for bitcoin. John sells hats for 1 BTC each. Mike sells coats for 1 BTC each. They are specialists and produce these goods more efficiently than the other could.
Let's say John and Mike trade their 20 BTC each for 20 of the other's good. Now, they have 20 of each good, AS WELL AS 20 BTC. Since they can easily produce their own goods, but less easily produce the other's type of good, they have made a net gain in trade, while maintaining the same level of wealth. This same logic applies if we introduce others into this tiny market who would be potential trade partners - overall wealth continues to increase as more goods are being exchanged for the same amount of very fluid bitcoin, and traded amounts of bitcoin are recouped as more and more trades are being conducted.
Now, let us look at another scenario, where BTC is more worthwhile to hold on to than use in trade (a scenario mapping a hoarder scenario):
John would LIKE 20 coats, Mike would LIKE 20 hats; however, they find it more useful to hold on to more BTC, as BTC keeps becoming more valuable to hold on to. So instead of a trade of 20 coats and 20 hats, they may reduce the amount traded to 15, 10, 5, or 0, depending on how much more value they are placing on holding on to BTC in this scenario. Nobody wants to be the guy that spends a few thousand of something on a pizza or two, after all.
That's an almost-no-math example that should be popular with anyone following the Austrian school of thought.

Only when sufficient legal reasons are given, and particularly in the case of assaulting or killing of citizens, when other citizens of the country are in physical danger.
But if you think a world without a state would end up in a world without rampant use of the above list of activities that violate the non-aggression principle you described, you're wrong. It would be at least as prevalent, and I would assume far more so. Look at essentially stateless areas with drug cartel problems (central america). That's what happens when the state cannot act against the nature of humanity organized and applying violence.

You're just making circular arguments.
My overall point:
In a democracy (in this case, a representative republic) it is the duty of members of society to be responsible citizens and vote for those who will provide the common good. This means, generally, voting in non-warmongers, voting in responsible people with public finances, voting in generally morally upstanding people. Sadly, this doesn't happen, as everybody is too busy watch TV or fucking off, or on the other hand may want to destroy the system - but the joke is on them ultimately, as the system withstands those types of influences on it fairly easily as it is very longevous and resistant to outside attack.
The overall point being, as well, that without an entity to monopolize violence (the state) that we can influence through non-violence (voting), we are left in a world where violence can be random and very brutal. A perfect case in point is Central America and drug cartels - weak states allow cartels, simply because the cartels are stronger and can enact violence more readily than the state, to murder entire villages if they so desire, if the people in those villages decide to stand against the cartels. This is what happens in areas where there is a power vacuum, and violent agent enters to capitalize on the lack of power in that place.
If you think that is an illogical argument, then I think I am actually the one making sense, and you are delusional.

It would be like if the rest of the world started using the Swiss franc. They'd still be using another currency - created by an organization (the Swiss government) that doesn't start wars of aggression. They'd still use it to fund whatever events they desired. Currency is just a means to an end, it is not the end itself, and any assumption made in that line of reasoning is wrong.

Have you perhaps thought that the society we live in is a reaction to the constant violence that existed in the past? That laws and regulations exist because order needs maintained, and that without a body with monopoly on violence, violence tends to be random and often?
The concepts of "power" and "violence" are a spectrum, where one exists in totality, the other is absent. In a world where power exists fully, there is no need for violence, as order is maintained as others accept the power and work with it to reduce violence to non-existence. Where violence exists fully, there is no power, and it is quite literally chaos as violence can happen at any time by any party trying to consolidate "power" through violence.
As the most violent group dominates, they transition to "power" along the spectrum. This is the history of the modern nation state, starting in or around the 1600s as far as history shows. It still exhibits violent tendencies today, and the general consensus of any rational being living within it is that they should be engaged to create a more ideal society. The desire to disengage with society is detrimental to all and essentially the equivalent of backpedaling through history due to what could be called the "golden age" fallacy, where one who has never experienced history looks upon it in a more favorable light than it should be viewed in.

There's little argument for this, jobs just move to different sectors. Now, the extremely unskilled will have nowhere to go, definitely, and for that we should have jobs programs and infrastructure building programs requiring low skilled labor.

Bitcoin hardware is also only an abundant commodity for those who can afford it as well as have the capacity to run it, service it when needed, set it all up properly, etc.
Perfect competition is a theoretical construct, it simply doesn't exist, ever. I was looking at this from a "You end up creating bitcoin and sell it for fiat" view, by the way. I am not looking at it from a "you create bitcoin and keep it" stance. If you couldn't sell it for fiat, mining wouldn't be taking place, so that is where the market action and valuation of bitcoin (the product being supplied by miners, to the consumers who are those who wish to purchase bitcoin) happens.

But you have only reversed the parts appropriate to your argument. This is a fallacy that I can't recall the name of right now, but you can continue reversing terms to fit any argument as long as you select the right ones. For instance:
*Inflation* means that *nothing* becomes *more expensive* in the future. The longer you wait, the *more expensive* it will be. So *inflation* means *every1* *sells* [from now on], right? Seems like a *solution* to me.

@_date: 2014-01-23 14:47:06
That's the point I try to make with people all the time - we take small hits to the economy to avoid larger ones. I don't think anyone truly understands the devastation that would happen if currencies and economies just FAILED one day out of nowhere - famine, wars, etc., could all easily be a part of it. To think that those that have spent their whole lives studying the system don't have some vested interest in maintaining the stability of it is silly, and the powerful will remain powerful, only will have justification to use violence to maintain that power instead of simple economic tricks and long term non-violent planning of wealth.
Power and violence are on opposite ends of a spectrum, and where one is absent, the other exists completely. This is evidenced by weak states - take much of central america, for instance. Where the state holds no power, violent groups attempt a power play by exerting force on the population. If an individual has some strange fetish for a world where violence reigns supreme, I have a sneaking suspicion that they've never had the displeasure of experiencing true violence.

Individuals are often the LEAST rational actors in systems due to the above. Yes, the thought of the [rational actor]( is often discussed, but that is just a useful thought tool when working with models in order to see how specific parts of a model work while holding other variables constant.
Large organizations often use [game theory]( to decide courses of action. While I am not saying specific organizations do or do not use game theory in their decision making processes, it is safe to say that very large organizations with strategic departments most certainly take advantage of a logical thought process. Also, many developments in the application of our knowledge of behavior have helped change how systems are made in order to reach desired states, despite individuals' general lack of rationality (for instance, the field of [behavioral economics]( attempts to describe economic models with more accurate ways of accounting for individual variation in decisions based on non-rational behavior).

While I can't speak for central bankers, I think you have a skewed perspective on what the opinions of many economists may be, and would recommend avoiding blanket statements as if all economists think certain ways. There are many economists who do work concerning negative externalities, such as pollution, as well as economists who do work concerning systems based around sustainability (as a matter of fact, I think many economists would greatly appreciate increased efforts for producing market structures that would increase sustainability, as it suits the economic mindset very well to think about those problems).
In the same way you blanket economists as greedy central bank shills (it would appear, from that last sentence) who don't "do science", many economists might blanket all of the bitcoin community as various types of shills for anarchistic idealism. And, since the community isn't all that, I would think the blanket statements do more harm than good, and/or expose personal biases that may hinder rational thought and create fallacies.
EDIT: Seriously, what's with this place and the downvoting without an explanation? Isn't that against reddiquette? I'd like to know why what I said isn't adding to the discussion.
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:29:44
My assumptions:
You have a job paying you in inflationary currency (USD).
You have investments in deflationary currency (bitcoin).
Why would you use the bitcoin, which is appreciating in value relative to goods and the inflationary currency, to sell off for USD and pay debts? Wouldn't you maximize returns by holding onto to the bitcoin and use your wages to pay the debt? EDIT: Hell, you're going to incur extra costs for exchanging currencies. Unless the extra cost is smaller than the debt payment within a certain timeframe, you're losing money buying bitcoin just to sell for USD. Hanging on to it maximizes returns.

The US was the original venture capital experiment. We started as colonies that large powers backed with funding and sent armies to tame the wilderness. Then, as individuals realized over here that they were being had, they revolted - but the revolt was not instigated by the common man, but by those who controlled capital and stood to profit from it. Yes, yes, "freedom" and all that, but lets call a spade a spade. Without shrewd business deals, we wouldn't be alive - the leaders were doing business deals with heads of state against each other (see: Benjamin Franklin and France, and all the direct quotes from diaries and letters talking about profit from trading goods and services as needed, and holding back supplies to increase price as demand remained constant, or even increased). We are a multi-corporation corporation, and we are marketed well not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the world that does business with us.
In the US, capital talks, all others walk, because we were founded from capital, and we will live and die from capital. To fight capital is to fight a losing battle.

You drew a lot from a comic, which probably says far more about you than it does me, actually.
My point is that, "increasing at a logarithmic rate" is meaningless if it's just the same people using it over and over. Grandma isn't using it. It's just a bunch of people buying and selling speculatively back and forth - that's that "logarithmic" growth you are seeing, and an absolutely worthless feature. I just don't see the stuff going mainstream, as it doesn't really do anything for mainstream users. I'm not dying to transfer funds to someone in Asia or Europe or Africa only to have to deal with an exchange imploding and losing my investment, and 99.999% of other people aren't, either.
I mean, think about this - let's say you have 20 BTC in some exchange somewhere, or a wallet site, and they just poof, implode (like gox) and disappear with your coins. At $600 each, that 12 grand. That's not chump change.
Now, let's say the risk is only 1% that the service implodes or scams you (see the app that's been posted here) or whatever. A 1% chance at losing $12,000 is actually a $120 fee to use the service if you are calculating risk. And that's just 1% - based on your use, it could grow. In order to actually use the stuff as easily as cash or a card, you'd have to drop your security concerns down significantly, and that jumps your risk significantly. Now let's say you raise to 5% risk - that's a constant $600 fee you are paying. That's a 1/20th service fee. That's not cost effective.
The tech would have to be a decade old to get a level of adoption mainstream users would accept concerning risk (pulled this number out of my ass), and even then, since it's open source, it will probably just be improved upon and used in finance/currencies that exist somehow, but privately and patented, further negating its mainstream adoption.

If it made economic sense to build them, why didn't they build enough to not need the government to create them? Hmm... Perhaps because the return on investment was so low?
EDIT: And before this is misunderstood: You see all sorts of markets everywhere that the government hasn't put it's paws into. There is no huge government push to create lightbulbs, despite the fact that lightbulbs are a societal necessity in this day and age. Had roads been capable of being handled effectively by private investors, they would have remained that way. You yourself are the one that shows historical ignorance in not recognizing that innovation often happens in the private sector, but as certain innovations end up not being financially viable in the private sector but useful to the public at large (national defense, highways, etc), governments eventually take over their production.

The point is that it is at least as easily manipulable on the time frames that governments work with as fiat, if not more so. If they wanted to control it, they just slowly buy until they control a large portion of it, then they can tank the price or inflate the price or do whatever they want with it.
This isn't rocket science. If billions of dollars can sink down the black hole that is unlisted intelligence and military spending, it can easily be used to manipulate competing "currencies" if desired.

No, it's a classic problem known as the [Free Rider Problem](
And, I don't mean this in a sense you see online and on television all the time of "free riders" on welfare. You can very easily be on an assistance program and not be a free rider in terms of the democratic process. I mean this in the sense of those who exist in the comfort of a democratic republic and willfully disengage. These take the form of the following:
(Do note this is not an exhaustive list.)
Those who sit around hoarding guns, hating them libruls and Obummer and are "just waitin' for the revolution, man."
Those who sit around getting stoned and talking about how in a hypothetical world we could all live in peace and harmony, hating those idiot rednecks hoarding guns who voted for Mittens, and are "just waitin' for the revolution, man."
Those who think cryptocurrency will somehow usher in a golden age of anarchism brought on by some fetishized view of algorithmic learning and are "just waitin' for the revolution, man."
Those who would prefer a military dictatorship or a theocracy and are "just waitin' for the revolution, man."
You'll notice a theme in the above examples. There are further themes that run through those various camps, many of which overlap as well, but all are equally damaging to the gains humanity has achieved over several hundred years of western civilization pulling itself out of the shit pile it dropped itself into over the last thousand or so. It is generally depressing to see it, but it is the nature of the free rider problem when applied to democratic institutions. Fantasy always looks better than reality and it becomes easy to disengage as one becomes disassociated with the overall process that created the comfortable lifestyle we enjoy today.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:01:03
Keep worshipping at an altar, I'll keep my head in reality and paying attention to historical accuracy to base my ideas off of.
The free market has never created a successful currency yet, because the one thing that creates a successful currency - non-competition - won't allow a free-market currency to exist long enough to become standardized.
I assume free market in this context is one that is ripe with competition, of course. If you are talking monopoly markets then yes, they can potentially do exactly what only government has traditionally been able to achieve (monopolies, for instance, are what created the value of gold and were the entities large enough to engage in large-scale extraction efforts - as well as dictatorships throughout history raiding other dictatorships who had amassed enough of the stuff to warrant the expense).

I'm not sold on that - as most bitcoin are sitting in wallets and only a small amount are being used in transactions, it would appear overall demand of goods in relation to bitcoin is very low. You can call that speculation, and some of it may be, but what is speculation other than a disinclination to spend money today in the hopes it will increase in value in relation to goods in the future? This is a completely parallel concept to deflation due to demand for goods lowering by themselves. The effect is the same overall in terms of economic activity.
EDIT: Honestly, you can look at it like this: In the bitcoin economy, the population is increasing (new users are joining the protocol). More goods are being produced than ever (there is an increase in potential goods each bitcoin can chase as more producers enter the economy). The money supply entering the system is slowly decreasing (less bitcoins are being produced now than in the past). These are all indicators of deflation. By themselves, they can be managed, but when they all act in unison, you historically have always ended up with massive deflation.

There are certain conditions that must be met for perfect competition to exist, and this is why you can't begin to consider this in terms of perfect competition:
1. Atomicity (no single firm stands out or is dominant).
2. Product homogeneity (each product is the same)
3. Perfect information (consumers and sellers know all other prices etc immediately)
4. Equal access (if a certain place sells for less, I can just go purchase it now with no additional costs)
5. Free entry (if there is profit to be made, there is no barrier for a new entrant)
1 is obviously not true, I'm not certain how 2 applies in this case but it might be true. 3 is rarely ever the case anywhere, but it might be closer to truth here than in other markets (the protocol is well known and discussed freely and doesn't get crazy changes on the fly that only insiders would know about, and prices for bitcoin are listed online from exchanges... The problem is that some exchanges take forever to do stuff, etc., so that kind of rules the next point out, 4, for instance). 4 may or may not be true depending on how we are looking at this. 5 definitely isn't true.
This could never be modeled as perfect competition simply because it doesn't meet the requirements of perfect competition. Thus, it is to be expected that profits of firms would be greater than their marginal costs if they wish to keep participating in the market.

I think they're considering that it's still divisible down to a certain point, not infinitely divisible, so you still have the same issue you're talking about.
I mean, the smallest USD unit is something like 1/100th of one cent, and we don't use it, because that's not how the human brain works in terms of money. If the USD hyperinflated, we still would never use 1/100th of a cent.

There is no perfect "solution" to these problems, but generally they are mitigated through intelligent regulation. The "tragedy of the commons" is a direct reference to a time and place lacking oversight on intelligent use of limited resources. You don't get intelligent regulation when a portion of society disengages from its civic duty of keeping its representatives accountable in the hopes that the entire system will magically change due to some technology that comes along. History shows this to never have been the case - existing power structures simply incorporate emerging technologies into its fold.

Here's an [interesting paper on deflation and growth, with sources]( and appropriate commentary.


Emphasis mine on the most important concept - since the supply of gold rarely changes, and as economies generally continue to grow, the same amount of money ends up chasing more goods. This drives the value of money (i.e., notes backed with a fixed amount of gold) up.

Paypal or Visa isn't purporting to be a currency. Bitcoin is. I believe that, ideally, those that support Bitcoin the most want it to be the only currency in use. And the argument is that it won't - that it will always be a vehicle for USD or other currency bitcoins can be converted to. No one is obligated to use ONLY bitcoin, and with all of the other options still available to use to move USD or other currency around, and with the relative security of most big currencies, I think you will be hard pressed to see people only doing business in bitcoin.
The other common argument is that Bitcoin will be adopted when fiat currency fails - but, if fiat currency fails, Bitcoin will see no use, as its value will still be valued in USD/other currencies.

I would disagree. Behavioral economics, a fairly recent addition to the field, is mostly applied psychology, but economics itself is ultimately some form of calculus based on some assumptions to simplify models. The behavioral econ crew seems to want to expand the models to make economic thought more applicable to the real world as heuristics and biases (and all the things that make humans something other than the "rational actor" of previous decades) become taken into account. There is also a strong distinction between [positive economics and normative economics]( which tends to confuse many when people talk of "economics" - most media coverage of economics is actually coverage of normative, when in reality most economists do work in positive economics, as that has more of a bent towards science and less towards politics.

Groups absolutely can decide things, through bureaucratic processes and the general structural elements of the group. The individual decisions on a micro basis form macro decisions that groups adhere to - this is an idea that supporters of the free market could correlate to the "invisible hand". What are committees, panels, juries, board rooms, etc, if not macro decision making organisms whose larger decisions are based on the aggregate decisions of single entities within it?
The heuristics and biases above can either contaminate an organization and cause it to act outside of what would normally be considered rationality (case in point: witch trials, Jonesboro cult, PTA/townhall meetings), or it can be a tightly structured organization with processes in place to withstand the above individual failings of humans and act in a very rational or logical manner (case in point: an executive board room of a top performing corporation, an intelligence agency department with mountains of bureaucracy and procedure, chess teams agreeing on an optimal strategy to take in a situation they may encounter in their next tournament).
The difference between the first examples and the second examples is that one group consists of individuals who are unaware of the biases present (or willfully ignorant), and another group adheres to structures and ideas based around group decision making (game theory, or at the least decision theory, or some form of "proof" based concept for taking action).

CO2 is really the only gas that can increase temperature as much as we've seen in such a short time, and we have released a ton of it in the past few centuries. Observations have been made from both space and at the surface of the earth to measure emitted radiation of the length that is characteristic of CO2, and it has been found to have less emitting back into space, and more remaining at earth's surface and in the atmosphere.

I personally would recommend a quick foray into game theory and iterated infinite-horizon games to get the basic understanding that:
1) If power can be consolidated over any time frame, it eventually will be, and
2) If power being consolidated is an inevitability, you must create a system that takes this into account.
The only system I know of that takes this into account is similar to current democracies and the state - generally, due to its capacity to field a military and conquer others through force if desired. Anything less than this type of structure will be absorbed by another state - sure you may have 1, 2, 5 generations of some alternative solution that somehow survives, but eventually one large organized body will swallow the decentralized one up due to more efficient organization of power.
I'm not arguing it's optimal, or right, or desired. Just that it is an inevitability, and you have to factor in inevitabilities. And once you do, your options go from this wonderful future, to having to actually deal with reality - it might not get you to make the perfect solution, but it will actually get you a realistic solution, and those are important, as they can actually exist in reality.

According to this, the cost can range anywhere between $2M and $12M per lane per mile. It also says there are 8.58 million lane miles of road in the US, which, if we had built them from scratch using a free market only, would have cost (using the above costs, lowest value of $2M as a lane-mile cost) $17.16 TRILLION. I just used the lowest cost to determine price, there is a strong likelihood that number could double or triple depending how much the increased costs of urban construction are (and they are significant).
It also lists upkeep and improvements for the 2010 year at $28.4B in total, or roughly $180 per year per person of working age in the US.

I don't get why you are in a subreddit full of anarchists (is in the sidebar for chrissakes) thinking you're going to regulate reduction in use of resources. Because, let's face it, that would be the only way it would work. Humans do not work like you wish they do, and all of history points to this being true.
I just realize that markets will eventually correct themselves. Using too much fossil fuel? The environment will fix that problem by showing people that global warming is not a hoax and is actually real. Using too much anything? It will become scarce, and people will adjust to the new prices of the scarce resource and either innovate new solutions or scale back use as price climbs.
And, at times, intelligent regulation works. Look at the orange roughy for what happens to a natural resource when no regulation exists, and sadly, regulation hasn't worked very well for the species. There are far too many avenues to fish the species and it is far too profitable for people to try and obey hard-to-enforce rules. in contrast, you have species that have successfully been saved, due to their generally not being eaten and very profitable in that regard.
In the same way, you can think that some sustainable movement will come along and save the world, but unless you figure out a way to engineer it to be more profitable than current systems, it probably won't take hold beyond some grassroots-style campaigns. Don't mean to be a negative nancy, it's just the truth.

And mind you, I am pro-legalized drugs - all of them. But organized crime works in money laundering and that is the main reason money laundering laws exist, to try to reduce the effectiveness of organized crime - also to give another vector for law enforcement to

Explain to me who has the capacity to spend millions of dollars on a single lane-mile of highway, and connect them all in a meaningful manner, other than the government? AND assure all parties in the country can use it? You can't possibly have "competing highways" as two highways in close proximity are redundant and a waste of finite resources (and the cost of upkeep? get out of here...)
In particular, address the points:
One - Highways are natural monopolies, and thus should be treated as such (regulated in order to provide optimal societal benefit, versus maximum profit for the monopoly).
Two - The poor would not be able to afford tolls as easily as the rich, thus affecting their ability to remove themselves from poverty.
Three - The right to movement within borders of a country should not be abridged for the citizenry.

Well, total US GDP is like 15 trillion, and the total number of bitcoin (most of which aren't in use) is something like 7 billion USD. That makes total bitcoin market share, at least in terms of GDP, at a ratio of 0.000467. Total US assets equals something like 188 trillion (this would be similar to "total bitcoin, in use and not in use", in terms of the US's ledger), so that's a ratio of 0.000037.

Convenient how you ignored the rest. But do also note that companies have an incentive to not monopolize as there is anti-trust litigation that can be pursued.
In a related vein, the market structure we have now for the vast majority of industries - gas, fast food, shipping, hardware, etc etc - is competitive monopoly, and not perfect competition (true free market). Perfect competition is quite literally an impossibility by definition and only useful in a base starting point for constructing models of markets.

That's a very bold statement. All you need to do with the party potentially lending you the money is guarantee a return on investment and minimal or no negative repercussions for the lending, as well as have a very powerful military.
For instance: Let's say Unluckyland has estimated untapped resources worth 1 million bitcoin, and has the unfortunate status of having a very weak and outdated military. They don't have the capacity to develop their land, as local conflicts keep them fighting over more simple resources such as farmland within easy access to fresh water. Luckyland, however, has no untapped resources, but over time has developed these resources into a powerful military and are very far ahead technologically of Unluckyland. Due to their advanced technological, logistical, and military status, to mobilize and successfully invade Unluckyland, they will only need 150k bitcoin. Their leaders bid on investors and are offered 200k bitcoin to build a war effort for payment over the next decade of 50k bitcoin per annum. This would result in Luckyland with 50k payments over a decade totaling 500k, with profit at 500k, and the investors have made 150% profit in a decade.
The case could also be made that if wars are desired by those who decide on war, and they have access to nuclear weapons but no funding for conventional war, you might see an increase in use of nuclear arms in conflicts.

You can easily expand the economy infinitely, just look at digital goods. Goods being bought and sold, and require infinitesimal spendings of energy to create.

I view bitcoin as an entity, like a collective, that exists as a firm selling its product, which is itself. That's essentially what cryptocurrencies are.
The collective firm has different branches, which are developers working on the crypto, and the businesses that deal with transactions of it (exchanges etc.)
That's how I would come at this. Bitcoin can be a product that could sell, but it is drowning in lack of responsibility upon itself, which is why it would never be adopted by the masses, unless a paradigm shift is in the works, and with all the ideology I see flying around, I don't think that's going to be the case.

Well, it could, possibly. And I actually think it would (as I think the violence comes from having to scare communities into adopting methods of production and distribution). But, I don't think that an environment with no organization claiming a monopoly on use of force (i.e., the government) will end with a peaceful society lacking in the use of force as means to achieve ends. That's hopelessly and fatally optimistic and flies in the face of the entirety of human history. Using force is the fastest way to achieve dominance in an area, and without one group being overwhelmingly powerful (that will dissuade others from attempting that path of success), you will just have many smaller groups trying to assert power through force on each other (and most especially, those without the means to use force against these groups).
If drugs were legal, there is a strong likelihood cartels would continue to exist, as they are essentially the monopoly force on violence in their respective areas, and their local governments can't fight that use of force effectively (especially since the relatively weak governments I am talking about are completely in the pocket of the cartels, or are essentially being held at gunpoint by them).

If you're getting charge backs regularly, the problem isn't the payment method, it's the shitty stuff you're selling.
EDIT: Let me clarify further:
A person purchases thing "A" from you. "A" provides utility "X" to the person, which is in excess of the utility of the amount of money "A" costs. If you get a charge back, it means that whatever you advertised or told them would be provided having "X" amount of utility, in fact, had less than that. In the case of a charge back, it had either less utility than an alternative option, or less utility than the money spent on "A".

No, I see the difference, but to tell the bank that you are buying the computer for security reasons is a horrible idea - assume there is an ongoing investigation, and the bank is complying with all federal agents who are asking for the relevant information. Let's say you claim your computer is for "security" improvements or purposes, which everyone understands to be one particular type of information technology (particularly, running encryption, network security, server-side processing of some nature, etc.), and you make that statement. You now have it on record that you weren't being completely honest - it can definitely be argued that bitcoin mining is in no way whatsoever a security procedure (and possibly invites security risk, as bitcoin has seen a wave of hacking attention since it's free money for those who can steal it), considering it will just be running hashes in order for you to gain bitcoin, which you will then use to exchange for goods or services, or exchange for currency at some point. And, considering the bank or investigators could probably do their own work, like examine where the purchase came from (for instance, the company you may have purchased from only deals in a particular type of "computer" which is specifically designed for mining and known to only be used for mining in 99% of cases), you have just set yourself up for even more investigation.
If you stand by bitcoin, I would think you would openly admit to buying a miner, and would stand by the fact that what you are doing isn't nefarious in any way. Yet, you want to tell half-truths? That paints you and the community you claim to support in a very poor light and shows you may or may not support it fully if something as minor as a bank asking what you are doing is an issue.

Oh my god, I love how this place's arguments go like this:
"Bitcoin, it's legit, not a scam, and an actual FAIR system! It's better than fiat! And just!"
