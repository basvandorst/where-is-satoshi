twfry is just another misinformed Fox acolyte and ultra right wing conservative. He thinks that Fox is the only one telling the truth [\(when that's the exact opposite of reality\)]( and therefore believes the right wingers when they blame us for the exact shit they do.
I've never seen any group feel as both righteously entitled to commit any fraud in the name of their "truth" AND exhibit an off-the-charts victim mentality against the ones they regularly abuse more than right-wing conservatives. 
Well... except for Christian right-wing conservatives. Those people have God on their side.

You do realize God doesn't exist, right? I was being facetious. And btw, wtf are you rambling about with all your double negatives and Tio Gordo references? That diatribe seemed a bit loony.

So I'm guessing that this is the language you made up as a child with your imaginary friend, and your imaginary friend is still sitting next to you as you type. ;) Let's see if I can translate a thought into your "uneek mindspeak" there, Nell:
*"Kden. Hokay looky heah, yer dipshitishness...ta smoove out yer crackly mindhashery inta a mor fruid slippityslide I'd git a lil sumpin' frum tha streetcorner-greengrocer and smoker up til ya kin speakadafuknengrish streemly k-k-kopacetic, knowwaddamean there, schiz?

You know, I'm just having a bit of fun with you, hwman. You've obviously been cultivating this peculiar voice for a while and it works for you. I actually like it, even though it's a bit obfuscated by the irregular syntax and oddly twisted colloquialisms. It prohibits "fruid" comprehension but the flavor is... tangy.
You keep on keepin' on, brother. :]
