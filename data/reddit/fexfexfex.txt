I want them to not comply with illegal laws and destroy the fabric of our civilization. Yes. Fuck you.

That would be retarded and Mt Gox was not that level of retarded. The people who are pulling off this heist have no idea how to move the money. This means they are doing it through the Mt Gox systems, they didn't know to hire coders to help them launder the money. They probably had no idea that btc have very transparent transactions either.

They're aligning with the BRICS alliance and they're giving a big fuck-you to the West and its corrupt institutions.

True, my gripe is with regulatory failings in general.

Really, the FIRST bitcoin economy? What about $5 billion dollar one currently operating over the globe?

It's a valid concern.

I can't believe you're arguing in favor of the government and comparing the resources of one man versus the resources of a corporation the size of Argentina. Shame on you, you sir are a traitor to the nation.

Since it's non-transparent and all reports indicate otherwise, I'm not holding my breath.

Google hands over your data to the NSA. If they support anything that's in your benefit, it's just lip service for a marketing ploy. Sorry to burst your bubble it's 2014 not 2006.

I don't like you.

No he's right. These guys should watch out. It won't be a problem in the short to medium term, but long term if this catches on in Mexico, it's going to be a wonderful way to launder money. Especially since you can make CASH deposits at any Oxxo. This is a narco dream! They've been curbed a bit by recent banking regulations and taxes on cash deposits. But this bypasses those regulations completely.

Wow, we live in such a different world today... a world in which banks infinitely rehypothecate gold reserves.
Good thing the SEC was around to prevent that.
