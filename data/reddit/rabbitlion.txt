A hard fork to increase the block size would not be very contentious if it was supported by or even initiated by core developers. If core 0.14.1 included the block size increase it would not be very problematic at all and basically everyone would just upgrade. The reason core developers does not want to hard fork has nothing to do with contentiousness.
Many people including myself do not want a hostile hard fork from implementations like Classic/XT/Unlimited because that would be contentious, but we would very much like it if core developers were to agree to do it in the core client.

Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the block chain. This avoids the need to have a centralized database managed by a trusted third party.[10] Transactions are broadcast to the network using software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes.[11]:ch. 8 To avoid the need for a trusted third party to timestamp transactions, decentralized block chains use various timestamping schemes, such as **proof-of-work**.[12]

But they don't achieve it just from the source. They set up the entire build environment in a Docker image so you essentially build the app in virtualized tightly controlled environment. And at that point, you don't just need the ability to understand the source code to know if the program is malicious, you also need to be able to examine the virtualized environment for hacks and tricks that would modify how the final apk looks.

Well, the main purpose of a currency is not as a store of value. If you are investing money, it doesn't make a lot of sense to just hold the currency for no interest. You would at the very least place the currency in an interest bearing account where it could be lent to others, or invest in stocks or mutual funds.
In general the interest rates are closely related to inflation anyway, so it doesn't make a big difference for the average investor/consumer. You have a point in that the cost of a transaction should be paid for by the one making the transaction, but the security of the blockchain isn't only the concern for the people who transacted in a particular block. The ones making the transactions should under that system only pay enough to offset the cost of transferring/storing the transaction.

Absolutely, though it is a hard fork. Currently there is very little support for such a change so it's not going to happen anytime soon. 
In general though, an inflation scheme is a very viable alternative to a fee market. Most economists agree that some amount of inflation is a positive thing (2% is often the target) and this is fairly easy to set up in a cryptocurrency (in the total coins sense, not in a consumer price index sense). Personally I've never understood the reasoning behind the coin cap.

"Top" sorts comment by raw score, upvotes minus downvotes. A long time ago this was the normal sorting, but it's not optimal as something with 1000 upvotes and 800 downvotes was placed above something with 100 upvotes and 0 downvotes which is typically a much better comment. Thus, the "best" algorithm was implemented. You can read more about it here: 
When sorting posts by "hot" it will place much importance on the age of a post, so that you only see posts from the last 20-30 hours. However, the "hot" sorting doesn't make any sense for comments and was removed: 
Controversial sorts by how contentious a comment is. Comments with a lot of both upvotes and downvotes end up at the top, even if their final score is low or negative. This has been found to counter-act brigading efforts, so in some of the recent threads here the mods have put controversial as the default sort.

Doing hard forks by majority vote is a terrible TERRIBLE idea. I cannot stress enough how disastrous it would be to do such a thing. You need to have a near-consensus to do a hard fork successfully, and the entities that are important is the exchanges, payment processors and mining pools/companies. Your idea of a vote would most likely let a ton of completely irrelevant actors vote which would make it even more disastrous.


It's certainly possible that the change process could be improved, as someone else have mentioned it can be hard to get a change request even considered. This doesn't mean that it's particularly difficult to say when a change is no longer contentious.

Censorship is not exclusively government censorship. Private institutions and organizations can also censor and the term can certainly be appropriate when talking about moderated communities such as a subreddit. Still, there's a difference between censorship and rules. For example has rules regarding "sex questions" that have at some point been dominating the community too much, and recently they have completely banned the asker from having any text at all in the body of the post (question must be contained in title). Since the purpose of the rules is not to limit anyone's free speech but rather to improve the quality of the subreddit it would not be appropriate to call it censorship.
This is not the case for though. The ban of XT-related posts is not intended to improve the quality of the subreddit. The reason such posts are banned is because theymos strongly opposes contentious hardforks and thinks that forbidding people from talking about it here will help prevent it from happening. Basically it's a politically motivated ban and therefore I consider the censorship term appropriate. I agree with his opposition to hostile hardforks, but I think his censorship is the wrong approach and I think it's hurting his cause instead of helping it.
There's also the dishonesty of using the altcoin rule as an excuse as it's clear that XT is not an altcoin by any reasonable definition. He could just add a new rule about promoting hostile hardforks, so it's unclear why he's sticking to this dishonest classification as the reason. The fact that he has also been removing posts/banning people over more generalized blocksize/BIP101 shows even more that it's not really about the altcoin thing. Overall I'm just amazed and confused on his recent actions.

There are several errors in your post.


This is mostly correct, though as each block takes 4 times longer or more it takes even longer than 2 weeks. If 25% stays it takes 6-10 weeks to get back to normal, if 10% stays it can take 15-25 weeks.


This is not correct. For a specific hash rate, rewards will not be less frequent. If 25% stays block time will be 40 minutes but those same miners only won a block every 40 minutes before the split anyway. Even if they switch they will still only win a block every 40 minutes. There's no guarantee that it will be lower value just because there is less mining power on the chain. The longer block times would be inconvenient for the period it lasts, but it's not an insurmountable problem. Many transactions will either be 0 or 1 confirmation which is reasonably quick, and others won't really care much about needing 4 hours for 6 confirmations.


This is a misunderstanding of the dynamics of the bitcoin economy. So far, the value of bitcoins has always been decided by how much fiat currency people are willing to pay for it. That will be true even after the hard fork. The economic majority are the ones deciding which chain becomes dominant. Even if 75% of mining power mines on the new fork the coins would be worthless if you could not sell them for dollars or spend them at merchants. The miners and users are forced to follow the economic majority, not the other way around.
One somewhat bizarre possibility is that exchanges/merchants will protect themselves by requiring that coins are transferred on both chains. For coins existing prior to the fork this would not be a big problem as the same transaction is valid on both chains, but if you won a mining reward you would have to somehow acquire coins on the other chain to be able to spend them. The value would be equal for coins on both chains, or possibly higher for the original chain as fewer rewards would be generated there. Mining power would eventually be split 50/50, but there could also be significant fluctuations. When the difficulty adjusts after a number of weeks, you could see tons of miners switching over to the lower difficulty chain to maximize rewards.   This could happen for every difficulty adjustment on either chain, tons of miners jumping over to the lower difficulty. If the original chain ever catches up to the &gt;1MB fork though, all the people mining on that one would automatically, instantly discard the old chain and it would be permanently dead.
I'm not sure exactly how realistic this last scenario is, but it's not that farfetched and it explains why this sort of hostile hardfork is so dangerous. When you want to fork you need to make sure beforehand that the old chain will be dead and useless, and the mining vote that XT uses to activate can never ensure that.

I assumed that "what is right" in this context meant the better technical solution.


I have not even expressed my opinion on block size because it does not seem relevant in this discussion. I would not even claim a vote, because I'm not a relevant actor. If I was, for example by being the operator of a significant exchange, I would be perfectly willing to adopt a hard forking change I did not agree with for the sake of consensus. Appealing to the need for a consensus is a perfectly valid argument when trying to convince someone to go along with the hard fork, but you would probably already need a large margin majority for that to work.

He's basically saying that people may pay for a 64 gigabit connection because they want to run a bitcoin node.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:30:00




I made two points. The first is that the decision should be made by a near-consensus rather than a majority vote. I'm not quite sure how you get from near-consensus to minority opinion. If you tried to hard fork with 51% of the votes there's a high likelihood that people would not follow and that would be disastrous. In a political election for something like a president it's fairly obvious that the guy with 51% should win over the guy with 49%, but that's not what we're talking about here. It's closer to a constitutional amendment which requires a two thirds majority in both the senate and the house. The reason for this is that the constitution we have is stable and we should be careful with contentious changes. It doesn't mean we can never change anything on the constitution, just that we should give it careful thought. I would argue that a hard fork is significantly more dangerous than a constitutional amendment and should require something like a 90% vote.
The second point is that you don't have a clear idea of who gets to vote. For things like what transactions should be allowed or for soft forks, it's natural and obvious that the miners gets the vote. For a hard fork it's not so simple. Imagine a situation where 90% of the nodes and 90% of the miners agreed to the hard fork, but BTCChina, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, btc-e, Coinbase and Bitpay and others did not. This would mean that if you wanted to deposit or withdraw money from those exchanges, or pay to a merchant using one of the payment processors, you would still have to do so on the old chain. These powerhouses might not possess a ton of mining or voting power (in your system), but without them it's virtually impossible to do a hard fork. They would simply continue operating on their own branch with 90% less mining power, and you might be forced to revert your hard fork.
If all of the developers agree and the consensus among the community is that we should go for the 20MB blocksize, then these institutions would follow with the hard fork. If it's a contentious change where the developers and community is split, they might not. Regardless of which branch wins in that situation, it's likely to be disastrous for the continued growth and adoption of bitcoin.

Your fee was only 0.00001000 BTC which is too little even for a small transaction. Your wallet software is supposed to help you calculate an appropriate fee to get the transaction confirmed in a timely manner. Are you using an old or non-standard wallet, or did you manually set a lower fee?

The $12k is just for travel. Yes, he's certainly supposed to be compensated for his traveling expenses, but he did not get a blank check.
For most normal events, there would be a written down set of rules for things like this to prevent exactly this sort of situation. Either he would just submit the dates he was traveling an an event staffer would book the tickets, or there would be a fixed/maximum amount that he would be compensated for the trip. As the foundation's finances appear to have been badly mismanaged it's hard to say what the rules were if they even existed, but it's clear that $12k for a flight is excessive and that Patrick should not have assumed it was OK to book a $12k flight without getting that confirmed.

I recommend that you read the link you posted because they talk about it there. I also quoted the relevant section in my first comment here. I suppose I can take it again:
No, he did get reimbursed yet. He has an outstanding claim for $12k+, but the event was back in April and he hasn't tried to press the issue so the foundation hasn't dealt with it yet. It looks like they'll just ignore it for now unless Patrick brings it up. If he does, it could possible become a court case. It's important to know that as a board member Patrick was required to act in the best interests of the foundation, and spending $12k on first class flight tickets for himself hardly qualifies.
I believe it's unlikely that Patrick makes a thing out of it, he appears to be done with the foundation for now and he's probably quite well off financially anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:51:05


It's probably not. The reason why it's a problem at all is that when banks and others that lent money to Greece can't get it back they have to liquidate other assets to get back to a satisfactory reserve level. This leads to stock values lowering and investment drying up which hurts new businesses. Exactly how large the effect will be is hard to say at this point but it won't ruin the whole financial system.
It's also not an issue caused by the existence of fiat money, it's just what happens when someone borrows a ton of money and can't pay it back, and the same would happen if someone borrowed bitcoin.


There are physical limitations on how many bills a bank can stock. There are also limits to how much reserves a bank can reasonably be expected to keep, so if there are way too many withdrawals it's understandable if banks need some time to get the money ready in cash.


If a state is losing cash, it needs to either borrow money or increase taxes to cover for the loss. When the country can no longer borrow more money, taxes are pretty much the only way remaining.

In my opinion, forks that are supported by a significant amount of miners, nodes and important actors like exchanges and payment processors should be taken seriously enough to not be called altcoins.

He wants coffee buyers to use off-chain transactions. You and your coffee shop have bitcoin accounts at some sort of payment provider. When you approve the transaction the payment provider will verify that your balance is high enough and switch some numbers internally to move the money to the coffee shop's account without touching the blockchain. This gives you instant confirmation and reasonable security.
The actual blockchain would be used as a settlement layer and by people who are willing to pay the fees required for important transactions.

Yes, but it would be very problematic. Transactions would by default be valid on both chains and could be included in either or both. Only bitcoins that are mined on the new chains would be unique to their chain. If you wanted to split your possessions on the chains you would have to taint them by including them in a joint transaction with such unique coins. It could also happen that the old chain will process fewer low fee transactions and that such transactions could therefore make coins unique to the XT chain. This might leave your coins in limbo in an unconfirmed transaction on the main chain unless you use RBF to get another transaction with the same inputs through.

In terms of a hard fork, consensus is much more important than doing what's right. This does not kill bitcoin, but in terms of hard forks it does make it more centralized. The alternative is that you risk a true fork where two alternate branches are used by different groups which would be disastrous.
Even if we do a hard fork now, we will likely need to do it again at some point anyway, so I find that argument to be fairly weak.

How much of this is correct:
* Patrick is making claims of $12k+ in expenses.

That's mostly because the other sites that experienced problems went out of business and shut down, sometimes losing customer funds in the process. The sites that are still left are those that did not have any problems, and MtGox. Other sites may be safer, or they just haven't experienced any problems yet. At the very least MtGox have been able to get through its earlier troubles without any customers losing their funds.
While keeping your bitcoins yourself has worked out for you so far, in my opinion it's not a great idea to keep millions of dollars hidden in your home.

No, that's not correct. AdBlock Plus has around 20 million users, which is only 0.66% of the 3 billion internet users.


You continue to say that they are "trying" to do things. What are the concrete actions to stifle competition? In what way have they made it difficult for other ad blockers? Or do you mean that they are trying to create a disadvantage for other advertising companies? That doesn't affect the adblocker market, which is what we're discussing.
It seems like you're somehow trying to claim that AdBlock's usage of the "EasyList" list is similar to Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows, which is fairly ridiculous. Windows had close to a 100% market share on the desktop market, but more importantly the barrier of entry was much higher. If someone thinks AdBlock Plus is doing shitty things, it's very easy to create a competing AdBlock addon. You don't even have to create your own filter list, you can use EasyList (without the whitelist) or some other public available one. If you rather wanted to create your own filter list, you're free to do so and it will work with both AdBlock Plus, Adblock, and probably other addons.

There's almost no way to sell mining machines fairly. If the customer could make a profit by buying the machine to mine bitcoin, the seller could make the same profit by just running it themselves. Or in most cases a higher profit considering overhead of sales and scaling benefits.
The only way for it to make sense is if you cannot afford the initial investment to create the machine, and thus need money from pre-orders to do so. This could in theory create a situation where it's worthwhile to create machines for sale, but in practice it doesn't seem to work well (see almost all miner pre-orders).

1. Withdraw bitcoins.
2. Mess with the transaction.
3. You still receive bitcoins.
4. MtGox thinks transaction failed so they restore your balance to original.
5. Go to step 1.
They're not just destroying the data integrity, they're tricking MtGox into sending them bitcoins several times, totaling more than they had in their account. They're effectively stealing bitcoins from MtGox. As have been mentioned everywhere, there's no security hole in the actual protocol so outside of MtGox they can't profit from it.

If they were using an "industry standard" method of confirming the transactions, they wouldn't have a problem at all. The transactions would simply go through with a changed id.

They will not get their funds stolen now that they know what happened at MtGox, and it's possible they would never have been vulnerable to the theft.

Most likely they were given the information by MtGox themselves and the statement was planned to be synchronized with an MtGox statement declaring their bankruptcy. At the last minute (or 5 minutes past) something changed and MtGox asked them to withdraw the "Insolvency" part. Possibly a potential new investor showed up that could maybe rescue MtGox, or maybe their lawyers gave them strict orders to disclose nothing. It's hard to say why they're not being transparent about it, but it's possible they promised MtGox not to reveal it and they may have signed documents promising not to.
I think you might be a bit confused about the terms, specifically "insolvency". MtGox is not supposed and not allowed to use customer deposits to fund their operations. If the total amount of fiat+coins they hold is less than the total deposits, they are insolvent. This doesn't mean that they are broke and that all the money is gone. You are probably correct in that they only lost a relatively small part of their holdings, but they could still very well be insolvent if they didn't have enough buffer.

For starters a lot of people deposited USD, EUR or JPY, but even if that wasn't the case theft/fraud of an unregulated asset is still theft/fraud.
If you look at the user agreements for some online game like Diablo 3 or WoW, it specifically says that Blizzard can close down the service at any time without reimbursing people for time and money spent. Note how the user agreements of services like PayPal and MtGox does not say things like that. When you deposit funds/bitcoins there is an explicit agreement that you will be able to withdraw them later. If you are denied access to your deposited funds or assets, it's perfectly possible to file charges with the police and/or try to put the company in bankruptcy and try to recover your funds that way.
I cannot imagine any first world country ignoring fraud charges of this magnitude. This possible crime would be handled just like any other crime. If there's enough evidence to charge Mark with fraud they will try to get him extradited.

You're not contradicting anything of what he said. Your description even says "Gox believes the transaction never happened" which is exactly what he said.
Also, the description isn't exactly right. The attackers didn't target random just any withdrawal transaction and tried to race it into the blockchain. While that would be possible in theory, it would be very difficult to pull off. What actually happened was that was a change in the default bitcoin client a while ago where it stopped accepting some transaction ids with an incorrect number of zeroes, but MtGox still formed transactions with such ids. The attackers looked for failed transactions (due to invalid ids) in MtGox's transaction log. They then resubmitted a transaction with a modified id, this time a valid one. This meant they didn't have to race anything, though they still had to get lucky with the transaction id from MtGox.

There are basically three interpretations that you could legally argue for:
1. Each get from their asset "type". Fiat holders get 58% of their holdings and bitcoin holders get ~23%.
2. Group everything together in one pool and give everyone an equal share. I cba calculating what percentage that would be.
3. Fiat holdings are actual customer funds while bitcoins aren't, so fiat holders will have priority and get their entire amounts back first while the remaining bitcoins are distributed to bitcoin holders.
But somehow they came up with a 4th interpretation on their own without zero supporting precedents and laws, that somehow bitcoin holders should have priority and everything should be distributed to them. And by everything, I mean everything except whatever Sunlot et al. is skimming off the top for their own profit.

The remaining risks would seem to be:
1. You forget your password and coins are lost. Alternatively, even if you won't forget it you could die/lose brain function and your heirs cannot access the money.
2. Someone has physical access to one location and is able to figure out or guess your password. Your password might be long, but unless it's randomly generated it might not have as much entropy as you think.
3. Someone has physical access to all 4 locations and denies you access to the wallets (unless you agree to give them money). This might seem like a ridiculous "risk", but if someone finds out you have a lot of bitcoins it's not impossible that someone tracks down your safe locations.

I don't fully agree. Many remote execution exploits are based on some buffer overflow where you can only inject a very limited amount of instructions. This means it's common for such exploits to only act as a launcher for code found elsewhere. If they are fetching the code from an internet server, they can be blocked by firewall settings, but if the code is already on the computer that wouldn't help.
For these reasons there is some value in placing malicious code on a  computer even if you cannot execute it directly.

I don't think he would need to sell it on MtGox. I could be wrong but I don't think they keep user balances in separate wallets. They have a database that keeps track of balances and keep the bitcoins in their own wallets. Someone else that have had his coins for years could still get a failed withdrawal if MtGox tried to use nonexistent funds to pay him.


This is actually a very good point. Most likely they have been doing this for quite some time time. In the beginning it was almost unnoticeable as only a small portion of transactions failed (MtGox should have investigated at that point already). The fact that a very large potion of withdrawals fail now is very disconcerting as it should mean a significant amount of MtGox's liquid funds is gone. Since most should still be in cold storage I don't think we need to worry about them going under completely though, they'll probably cover the losses out of pocket like they've done earlier.

The safest long-term way probably involves some sort of "m out of n" encryption where each key is hidden in a different location (at home, bank vault, at your parents, etc). This is obviously prohibitively complicated unless you have a technical education and own a significant amount of coins.
The simplest solution is to have them on an online exchange/wallet, which contrary to what you say pretty much is a bank. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be as secure as we would like right now.
Keeping your coins in a paper wallet is a completely crazy solution. There are good reasons why we no longer keep large amount of cash at home and instead keep it in bank accounts, and these reasons still apply for bitcoins. It's a shame that there doesn't seem to be any trustworthy bitcoin banks, but telling people to keep their bitcoins at home instead is a terrible solution to that.

They still have the bitcoins, but they don't know which inputs are actually still available since they used a flawed method of keeping track of that. They'll need to write up some code that goes over the past failed transactions and fixes their balance sheets. This should hopefully not take more than a week, but it could take several. When this is done they should also be able to see which accounts have successfully withdrawn their money multiple times, though there's probably little they can do to recover the funds.
As mentioned in the FAQ you post, the majority of coins are in offline/cold storage and it's very inconvenient to move them. Most likely they will do as before and cover the losses out of pocket.

Well, kind of. There's a cost of failed sub-50% attacks since you'll lose out on the mining rewards when you mine a block and never submit it. This means that when you only have a probability of success (such as the 50% success figure with 40% hash rate) it's only worthwhile to attempt double spends of large transactions.
This can be easily mitigated by requiring a much higher number of confirmations for this kind of transaction. If you're buying a million dollar car or house with bitcoin, you're probably fine with waiting 2 hours (~12 confirmations), 6 hours (~36 confirmations) or why not even 24 hours (~144 confirmations). With 40% hash rate, a 144 confirmation transaction would only succeed 1 out of 16 000 000 times. And in the end even this likely wouldn't be needed, since in most cases you would be trading bitcoins for reversible assets. If your bitcoin payment ends up being reversed due to a double spend attack, they'll simply not give you the keys to the car/house (or call the police if they already did).

Not exactly. It was originally thought that the attacker was someone with the capability of quickly getting his modified transaction out to a lot of miners, thereby getting in ahead of MtGox. Since a transaction takes less than 10 seconds to propagate across the network, this would be extremely difficult unless you were running a mining pool of your own.
Now, it turns out that the attacker was probably just using the fact that MtGox's transactions were malformed. Every time MtGox sent out a malformed transaction that didn't get accepted by the network, he could modify the transaction so that it got accepted. This is a lot easier since there's plenty of time to do it and there's no competition with MtGox to see which transaction gets accepted.
So what I'm saying is, unless bitstamp was also sending out malformed transactions (which seems unlikely), it wasn't possible to exploit them like this. You could possibly still exploit them by racing to get your modified transaction accepted first, but that ould be much harder.

I'd like to make some additions to this. Blockchain.info doesn't give you direct access you your safe. If you want to take something out, you give blockchain.info the key and they will fetch the contents and give them to you. This means that any time you let them borrow the key, they could steal the contents rather than give it to you. Alternatively they could copy your key without you knowing and once they've gathered a bunch of copied keys they can steal everyone's money.
I'm not saying blockchain.info is going to steal your money, but they definitely could if they wanted to. By keeping your coins in one of their wallets you are trusting them with your money.

Because it's convenient. The simplest way to invest fiat into BTC and hopefully get back more fiat at a later date, is to simple leave the coins on the exchange where you bought them.


Keeping your own wallet is somewhat complicated and it isn't risk free either. Theft, hardware faults and fires are real issues that needs to be taken into account. You should probably back up your wallet at multiple physical locations, and suddenly you might have to trust the person who keeps the backup. You could password protect it, but then you'd need to choose a password that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
The safest solution would probably be to set up some kind of elaborate m out of n scheme where you put different keys with different people, ensuring that no one could steal your money on their own behalf. Is this really something we expect the average user/investor to do though? Is this a suitable requirement for joining the bitcoin world?
Sure, there might have been other online exchanges/wallets that were more trustworthy than MtGox, but it wasn't immediately obvious that this was the case. MtGox has had problems in the past, but contrary to many other exchanges they had at least proven that they could survive some issues. Since many people's entry point was MtGox, it was natural to keep the coins there. In my opinion, up until MtGox stopped BTC withdrawals it was far from obvious that it was such a bad choice.

The randomness of X still doesn't add anything here. By trying up to 100 000 iterations they find everything below that. You could do 100 001 iterations or even 1 000 000 in order to make it harder to crack. There's almost no added security in using a random number of iterations, especially not if the number needs to be small enough to be easy to remember.
Besides, this is exactly what current hash functions already do. PBKDF2 was created to be computationally expensive to brute-force and bcrypt/scrypt was created to also be expensive in terms of RAM usage to protect against GPU/ASIC brute-forcers. If those methods use less than 1 000 000 iterations, it's because they decided less was enough. It's possible that the acceptable cost of generating a brainwallet is higher than the acceptable cost of verifying a password, in which case you could simply run scrypt with more iterations.

The fact that increasing number of people were unable to withdraw can be attributed to either of two things:
1. The attackers double withdrew more and more causing more and more "tainted" inputs. The attack process isn't instantaneous as each time you'd have to wait for the balance to be restored after the transaction appears to fail. They also wouldn't succeed every single time, sometimes the transaction id change wouldn't successfully propagate and sometimes the transaction would be invalid.
2. Since tainted inputs stays but clean outputs gets spent in withdrawals, the percentage of inputs that are tainted go up. If they kept refilling their liquid coins with clean inputs from cold storage this wouldn't have any effect, but it would be understandable if they were vary of dipping into cold storage cash to cover for such abnormal transaction failure rates.
It could also be a combination of the above.

Well, let me enlighten you. For starters let's assume he spent $40k on the hardware that mines him $500 per day. This would make it seem like it would pay for itself in 80 days. However, bitcoin difficulty goes up ~20% every ~12 days. This means that money made will be:
Days | $/day | $/period | Sum
12 | 500,00	| 6000,00 | 6000,00
24 | 416,67	| 5000,00 | 11000,00
36 | 347,22	| 4166,67 | 15166,67
48 | 289,35	| 3472,22 | 18638,89
60 | 241,13	| 2893,52 | 21532,41
72 | 200,94	| 2411,27 | 23943,67
84 | 167,45	| 2009,39 | 25953,06
96 | 139,54	| 1674,49 | 27627,55
108 | 116,28 | 1395,41 | 29022,96
120 | 96,90	| 1162,84 | 30185,80
132 | 80,75	| 969,03 | 31154,83
144 | 67,29	| 807,53 | 31962,36
156 | 56,08	| 672,94 | 32635,30
168 | 46,73	| 560,78 | 33196,08
180 | 38,94	| 467,32 | 33663,40
As you can see, the rewards drop off heavily. The total amount gained when mining for infinite time can actually be calculated with a geometric sum formula and comes out at $36k. But, that's not the worst of it. That paints an extremely optimistic image of the situation. If we add to this a maintenance cost of $50 per day (this is probably generous), let's look what happens:
Days | $/day | $/day w. costs | $/period | Sum
12	| 500,00	| 450,00	| 5400,00	 | 5400,00
24	| 416,67	| 366,67	| 4400,00	 | 9800,00
36	| 347,22	| 297,22	| 3566,67	 | 13366,67
48	| 289,35	| 239,35	| 2872,22	 | 16238,89
60	| 241,13	| 191,13	| 2293,52	 | 18532,41
72	| 200,94	| 150,94	| 1811,27	 | 20343,67
84	| 167,45	| 117,45	| 1409,39	 | 21753,06
96	| 139,54	| 89,54	| 1074,49	 | 22827,55
108	| 116,28	| 66,28	| 795,41	 | 23622,96
120	| 96,90	| 46,90	| 562,84	 | 24185,80
132	| 80,75	| 30,75	| 369,03	 | 24554,83
144	| 67,29	| 17,29	| 207,53	 | 24762,36
156	| 56,08	| 6,08	| 72,94	 | 24835,30
168	| 46,73	| -3,27	| -39,22	 | 24796,08
180	| 38,94	| -11,06	| -132,68	 | 24663,40
As you can see, after 156 days we are now running the mining operation at a loss. Using these figures you would never make more than $24835,30 before having to stop.

To simplify it as much as possible: If a pool has 40% of the hash rate and 5% leave, they still have 35% and could very well grow from that, they're still a problem. If 5% of the hash rate does the block withholding attack, the pools "average luck" will drop to 87.5%. This should be noticeable, but since it's hard to know who's doing it it's also very hard to stop. It's very unprofitable to keep mining at the 87.5% level, so this could lead to a lot of people leaving the pool.
This is why the block withholding attack is more effective than simply leaving the pool. Your original reasons as to why people will never do this are correct though, people who were informed and ambitious enough to do anything about it probably left already. Additionally, to execute the attack effectively you also have to mine at 87.5% effectiveness yourself, which actually costs money.

Their balance tracking was based on transaction ids.


No. If this was the case, they would not have lost any money. The entire exploit was based explicitly on the fact that MtGox failed to detect successful transactions and restored the account balance or re-sent the coins thinking that they still had the coins in the hot wallet.


Yes, this is possible but kind of unlikely. It's possible that they did this once or so, which could have caused them to lose 10% instead of 5% or something like that, but it's unlikely to have been repeated when the problem only got slightly better temporarily and then worsened again.

Yes, but that would not have worked for anything but a 0 confirmation transaction.

The 3% figure is a lie from these very people trying to make this deal. It's a statistic based on normal bankruptcies where the company is completely broke and has no assets to distribute, while MtGox still have very significant assets. The "normal" bankruptcies also have a number of privileged creditors that get 100% of their money back, leaving very little for the rest. This is is probably not the case here. Finally, even in those normal circumstances that doesn't the actual average for unsecured creditors is closer to 10% than 3%. The 3% figure is a lie to attract customers, just like the "10 years in court" scare (actual average in Japan is something like 13 months).

You're correct, this wouldn't work, at all. The basic idea seems to be that one person sends another person bitcoins with the promise of a future fiat payment, but the system does not implement a way to force this future payment. Someone could very easily borrow bitcoins and refuse to pay back. A liquidity swap market isn't really possible without some kind of centralization.

You could basically do the same thing with cash. But:
* Insurance policies have a maximum payout depending on your rate. If you choose to pay extra to insure value above what your furniture etc costs, then yes you insured your bitcoins more or less.
* You might have to prove that you actually had cash/bitcoins there. While the insurance company might take your word for it, they could also ask for proofs such as receipts or statements from banks/exchanges/wallets.
* There might be clauses about taking reasonable precautions. For example they will certainly reimburse $500 of cash. If you claim a loss of $5000 you might have to provide a legitimate reason for keeping that much cash at home. If you claim $50 000, it gets even harder to justify.

That ticket had nothing to do with solving these issues from what I can see. Looks more like a tipping service for bitcoin developers.
As the developers who commentated on your issue clearly stated, the bitcoin core repo is for suggesting concrete changes to the application, preferably (but not necessarily) with the code changes already made. Your ticket is more of a vague "the bitcoin community needs something like this". As Mike Hearn says:

Not exactly. While it's very possible to work around the design issue, it would pretty much have to be considered a flaw or even a bug in the current code. There is no valid reason to change the transaction id and it should not be allowed if it can be prevented. The only misleading part of their statement is this:


**Most wallet and exchange services** will keep a record of this said hash in order to be able to respond to users should they inquire about their transaction. **It is likely that these services will assume the transaction was not sent** if it doesn't appear in the blockchain with the original hash and have currently no means to recognize the alternative transactions as theirs in an efficient way.
Most well-coded wallet and exchange services does (hopefully) not use the transaction id to track their outgoing transactions exactly because of this issue.

Customers didn't lose money directly here. If any bitcoins were stolen they were stolen from MtGox, and that would only affect customers if MtGox goes out of business as a result. This doesn't seem likely as they have lost significant amounts earlier and still kept going (2000 btc in the 2011 theft, $5M to feds, $5.3M to CoinLab).
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:33:26
The effect of the malleability is that someone gets their bitcoins but MtGox think that the transaction did not go through and that the bitcoins ares till available for spending. When someone else later tries to withdraw MtGox tries to use those coins which is basically a double spend that is way way too late. The earlier theft causes the failed transactions, not the other way around.

Sorry you went to all that trouble, but you've missed a crucial factor, so I'm afraid it's you that don't understand how stuff actually works. The 51% attack is based on the fact that you always, always, keep mining on top of your own blocks. For example, let's say you mine a block, but the next block gets mined by someone else. Normally, you would abandon your mining and restart mining on top of the newly minted block that someone else mined.
With a 51% attack, you don't. You keep mining on your own block. Since you have more than 50% of the hash rate, you will generate blocks faster than the other chain, and eventually you will catch up to them. At that point, your forked chain will be longer than the previous main chain and you will be able to replace it. It might take a while to catch up sometimes, being 20 blocks behind would probably not be uncommon if you only have slightly more than 50%, but since you have more than half the hash rate the chance of catching up eventually approaches 1.
Doing this, you will control every single block and transaction, not 51% of them.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:21:14
You give two numbers for each choice, but not the actual spreads, which is confusing. In most situations right now, there's basically 0% chance that the uncovered odds will ever be filled (As of this writing it seems that you changed this part to a better but still mostly useless variant). The advanced form is better, but the slider still doesn't really accomplish anything and it's far from obvious what you're actually betting on and what odds you're getting. It's important to keep in mind that placing open offers is quite advanced and not something most people do very often. Also, right now it's very difficult to understand what odds you will be getting if you are filling multiple different orders. If there is 1 mBtc for  11.0 and one mBTC for 10.0 and I bet 2 mBtc at 10.0, will I actually get 21 mBtc if I win? Would it be better to do two separate bets?
Not to be harsh, but the current UI is such a clusterfuck that you're probably better off starting over, for example by just copying the betfair interface. Examples:
Single match result:   
Many matches on same page:   
Many winners for same competition:   
This is much more intuitive and easier to understand. As you can see, it's possible to place open bets and you can also get percentages if you want, but as it's not something a lot of people use it's a bit more hidden. I would also follow their example and limit the odds amounts to more even numbers, so that the bets are "unified" better. This gets around the problem of filling bets at different odds at the same time.
I get what you mean by the percentages, but using a different method than 100% of the betting sites that people are used to doesn't seem like a great way of breaking into the market, at least absent a revolutionary idea other than "betting with bitcoin".

Not really. Since you start out behind the main chain and must catch up and overtake it on order to replace it with your own chain, 50.00000001% would mean it would take years if not decades to ensure success. Since there are checkpoints with each client update this isn't gonna work.

@_date: 2014-02-10 12:58:17
So basically (I want to get this right):
1. MtGox tries to send withdrawal transaction A from wallet 1 to an external address.
2. Transaction goes through but MtGox thinks it doesn't go through.
3. MtGox thinks wallet 1 still has funds, so it tries to use wallet 1 to send transaction B to the same or a different address.
4. Wallet 1 actually has no funds, so the transaction is denied.
Is this what is happening? This would mean that MtGox could have lost bitcoins equal to the total amount of all the failed transactions in the last few weeks. Do we know how much that is?

Zero confirm double spends are easy to do with even 10% of hash power though. It's up to the payment receiver to not be vulnerable to such things, betting sites shouldn't be doing instantaneous bets for significant amounts for this reason.

@_date: 2014-02-20 19:49:21
No. If you knew that MtGox was going to make a negative announcement, it makes perfect sense to sell what you have and re-buy again after the price drops. The "risk" is that MtGox would suddenly open withdrawals shooting the price back up to 600 again, but if you know that couldn't happen the risk is eliminated.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:15:50
First of all, the double withdrawals were never accidental. You had to specifically exploit MtGox's accounting system for it to work. Understandably the thieves isn't going to come forward.
Secondly, how would you find a double withdrawal just from looking at the blockchain when you don't know what addresses withdrawals are sent from? There's no public ledger of all MtGox's addresses.

I'm not assuming that I could sell my bitcoins at any specific price, I'm more interested in using them to pay for things. If I wanted to sell my coins and use the fiat to pay for stuff I have been able to do that since forever. While paymium streamlines that process it doesn't get rid of the inherent issue that exchanging currencies is somewhat ineffective and that paying with bitcoins using paymium will effectively be more expensive than using fiat.

Yes, it could absolutely happen, but not if 750 000 BTC was actually stolen. MtGox isn't worth nearly as much as fulltilt was, so there is no chance someone would buy it if it would mean having to pay out 750 000 BTC.

@_date: 2014-02-10 20:24:06
There is absolutely a way. It's completely trivial on an individual transaction level. The original transaction still exists in the blockchain, so you can just look up the inputs and amounts and search the blockchain for a transaction with those same parameters with a different transaction id.
The only difficulty comes from the volumes involved. They can't do it manually for every transaction so they're gonna have to write some scripts that does this for every single failed transaction for the last 3 months or so and then clean up their database of available inputs. This would give them information on what inputs were actually still available and what user accounts were actually able to double withdraw. To be able to open withdrawals they would also need to develop code for a transaction verification that does not rely on the id. All this could take anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks.

It simply doesn't work at all because there's no way of knowing who is actually mining a block.

Your claim is that your wallets are safer than exchanges, but you don't really provide any supporting evidence. In hindsight it's obvious that keeping money at MtGox was a bad idea, but how do you compare the risk of losing your wallet to theft, harware fault or fire to the risk of an exchange stealing your money.
The root of the problem is that there is no completely safe way to store bitcoins and the more safe a method is the less convenient it tends to be.

For sub-50% attacks, there's a significant cost involved. If GHash.io wanted to do a 6 confirmation attack with 25% of the hash rate, they'd have to attempt it a shitload of times to succeed, and each time they failed (i.e. fell too far behind in the chain to even attempt overtaking it). There would only be a need to get more confirmations for transactions of thousands of bitcoins, and for those it's usually not a problem to wait 2 or even 3 hours.
(For a 51% attack this all goes out the window of course).
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:36:53
The difficulty of mining bitcoins currently doubles every ~30 days. This means that over the lifetime of your mining rig, even if it keeps going for 1000 years, half of the profit you ever make will come from the first month of mining. This means that if you get your delivery 30 days late, it has effectively lost half its value already. Additionally, the hash rate will be 15-20% of what was advertised and what you paid for.
But, it's actually much, much worse than this. Because of electricity costs, there's a static cost associated with every hash you do. Let's count a bit:
Your mining rig, delivered on time and according to specifications, will produce X dollars in the first month, 0.5X dollars in the second month, and so on. In total, it would produce 2X dollars in its lifetime. However, let's assume that you spend 0.1X per month on electricity to keep it running. This means that you will actually only profit 0.9X in the first month, 0.4X the second month, then 0.15X, 0.025X and then it won't be profitable to run it at all. In total this sums up to 1.475X.
Now let's look at the actual situation. Delivery is 30 days late, hash rate is 20% less and electricity is 20% up. The first month it would hash 0.4X but cost 0.12X so it gains you 0.28X. Second month is 0.08X and then it's already unprofitable. In total the profit you make in the second situation is only 0.36X, or 24.4% of what you calculated on and were promised. It's not hard to see why people think they're being screwed over. (Note that exact hash rates, electricity usages and delay days isn't exact as we don't know)
The 15% coupon off on the NEXT purchase is not much compensation at all, but the full refunds offered is very generous and means that no one is completely screwed over.

In the end they still have to make their case in a court or you get the money back. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to "prove your innocence". The requirement for a legal seizure is "probable cause for belief that a substantial connection exists between the property to be forfeited and the criminal activity defined by the statute." If the government is unable to show probable cause of that nature, you will get your money back.

Ok, let me break it down step by step. This is a basic 51% double spend attack and I'm the attacker. To start out with we have block 0, accepted by everyone. I send a transaction, and this transaction is included in block 1A that gets mined by a random user. This chain is built upon in block 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A and 6A. After it has this 6th confirmation, the merchant will accept my transaction and deliver the goods.
Meanwhile, I've been secretly mining a separate chain, starting with block 1B that builds on block 0. In block 1B, the transaction is sent to another destination. I keep mining in secret and find 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B and 6B. When I find block 7B (assuming this is before 7A gets found) I publish it. Suddenly, clients worldwide will agree that this is the longest, most difficult chain to find, and accept it as the correct one. Note that this is completely voluntary. Anyone who wishes is free to keep mining on the A chain looking for 7A, but it's effectively pointless as everyone else will be trying to find 8B.
Now on to my proposed change to the client. The suggestion is that once a client has accepted a block 6A and started building on a block 7A, it would completely refuse to accept any chain that doesn't include block 1A. When I try to publish the chain 1B-7B, any client that uses the new proposal will simply ignore it and keep building on 6A. This will cause a fork where miners with the classic client will build on 7B and people using the new client will keep building on 6A. If I had instead built by new chain on top of block 1A, my alternate chain would have been accepted, but the transaction I tried to double spend would only have 5 confirmations.
Now I'm sure there are very good reasons for why this wouldn't work well, but it's not one of the ones you have given.

Some people would worry, but most probably wouldn't. Before pools became a thing unknown was always a majority. Besides, it's easy enough to set up a dozen fake pools with 5% each, so hash rate isn't really a good attack detection method anyway.
The thing is you don't really need to use this kind of statistic to detect attacks, there are other ways that cannot be manipulated as easily.

That could help a bit yes, but:
* You could have sent it in fairly recently. It would be natural if a lot of people tried to get their accounts verified close to the end to get the bitcoins out while it was possible.
* They could shop them quite easily.
* Some sites might not care that it's old.
* Some sites might not require the utility bill.
This is probably not a huge issue for most people on most sites, but there could be a few cases where it's a security concern.

There's a lot of people who think that they "got into bitcoin early" and somehow they figure this must have been when it was new in 2010.

Before May 2011 almost no one even knew about bitcoin and the price had never been higher than $2.

Basically, they feel that trying to explicitly define and lock in exactly who would be included in the law isn't a good solution. It makes it hard to change and easy to dodge.
Which is why it says "as defined in the regulations". They leave it up to the regulating body, FINTRAC, to formulate the language used to define what is included.


(ii) remitting funds or transmitting funds by any means or through any person, entity or electronic funds transfer network,  
(iii) issuing or redeeming money orders, traveller’s cheques or other similar negotiable instruments except for cheques payable to a named person or entity,  
(iv) dealing in virtual currencies, as defined in the regulations, or  
**(v) any service described in regulations made under paragraph 73(1)(a);**
For non-virtual stuff, they explicitly define 3 activities, but under part (v) they also allow the regulating body to use their discretion to add other stuff that they didn't think of when writing the law. This is simply how these types of laws are written, so I don't think it's any cause for worry by itself.
This is actually quite similar to the recent FCC drama. The law gives the FCC power over common carriers, but they leave it up to the FCC to define what a common carrier is. Without that, it would have been impossible for the FCC to regulate ISPs because they didn't exist when the law was written. If the regulator screws up and doesn't interpret the law the way you want by including too much or too little (as in the FCC case), you change the law to be more specific in those areas.

The reason I think so is that you seem to believe that funds being stolen would lead them to transfer coins from cold storage.

I'm not an expert, but it doesn't seem like a great idea to partially expose your private keys. First of all QR codes contain error correction meaning they can be recovered without the complete code (your codes are probably covered enough to prevent this). Secondly, unless I'm mistaken, showing part of the QR code is the same as revealing part of the private key, which could make it easier for someone to brute-force it. Again I'm not sure how many missing characters in a key that is feasible to brute-force, but it never hurts to be safe...

For example, when a block is found consider the block 6 steps earlier locked in and refuse any chain that would orphan it.

I agree that a certain amount of bitcoin articles would be appropriate in Some introductory articles and explanations of how it works at first, and when there is a really large event such as the silk road seizure and MtGox crash. Looking at  we can see that there is a shit ton of bitcoin related links submitted that really has no place in 99% of what we can see there is of little to no interest for people who aren't into bitcoin and probably already subscribe to In most cases, this is solved automatically by votes. However, the bitcoin community is extremely zealous in "spreading the word" and promoting bitcoin wherever they go. This leads to a situation where bitcoin related content gets spammed AND upvoted all over reddit regardless of how relevant it is to a subreddit. This is similar to how seem to leak into pretty much every single subreddit, causing almost everyone to have rules concerning political content. People don't care if something is misplaced, as long as it shits on republicans, NSA or just the government in general, they'll upvote it.
Having automatic filter words instead of actively moderating the content is sort of lazy, but I do understand them. It's hard to catch content manually before it hits the front page and constantly deleting stuff from the front page would be met with similar of not worse outrages. In the end, I think the current system with filter words is fine as long as moderators give serious consideration to approving a link if asked.

Well, the estimated time to catch up depends on how much above 50% you are. However, now that I think about it you could pretty much avoid the issue by always starting out ahead. Keep mining as normal until you find a block, but don't submit the block. Instead send a fraudulent transaction and start mining on top of your secret block. This way, you always start out ahead and reduce the chance of being far behind for a while.
But yes, to execute a 51% attack you need to sustain that level for a while. Spiking to 51% for a minute won't help, but an hour could easily be enough.

You should, or at least someplace online.


As you said, losing bitcoins due to technical "issues" is more common than theft. Online backups are pretty great against that. I mean dropbox or something else doesn't matter much as the security lies in the encryption anyway.

They would not have seen the hot wallet emptying since they believed the transactions failed. In their books, they still had all of the coins.
Since they keep the vast majority (surely more than 95% and probably more than 98%) of their coins in cold storage, you are correct in that they didn't lose huge amounts.

Firstly, attacks will never be impossible, only statistically improbably to succeed. Secondly, unless something radical changes in the protocol a 51% attack will be almost certain to succeed, and I don't think anyone is really trying to "fix" that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:29:16
In theory, it's not impossible, but it didn't happen. The double spend failures (i.e. MtGox trying to send money it thought it still had) didn't start happening until a month ago or so, before that they couldn't have lost substantial amounts without noticing. It's also unlikely that they would have tapped into cold storage because of failed transactions when their own books indicated that they had the money.
IF as much as 750 000 BTC was stolen, which is incredibly unlikely, the only explanation I can see is that Mark actually never bothered to create a cold storage.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:49:42


It's possible, but not likely. Even if they own less coins than the total of the user balances, they surely own more than enough to cover this relatively small amount of withdrawals. 


Bitcoins are inherently very hard to lend because it's hard to take them back if the borrower doesn't freely give them back. You could of course try to sue in the legal system but this seems very unreliable considering the international nature of the bitcoin business and the lack of precedent. Besides, is there really any demand to borrow bitcoins for interest? I suppose someone wanting to take a short position might do so but again it seems a bit risky considering you might not get them back if value rises too much.


Yeah, kind of. The explanations that have been given are very plausible and there is little reason to disbelieve them. MtGox hasn't really done anything shady in the past to warrant conspiracy theories like this.

It's completely unknown how they will treat bitcoin creditors vs fiat creditors, whether they will recognize that bitcoins are not a debt but actually customer funds, if there will be a difference between verified and non-verified customers etc. There are some people with much larger losses than you actively applying some legal muscle to the situation, which will benefit everyone.

If this is a response to my "No you don't" as the context implies, I would very much like to see your argument for why you need more confirmations for shorter block times. The probabilities involved simply doesn't work like that. Your chance of beating the public chain over X blocks depends on your hash rate percent, not the block time.


I'm not sure exactly what you mean by network latency here. The issue that is usually talked about is the bandwidth needed to include transactions in blocks and send them. The overhead for a block is limited to 97 bytes ([source]( which is insignificant, and the remaining 1M bytes (give or take) is used for transactions. Halving the block length would also roughly halve the bytes needed for transactions in that time period, so it doesn't really change anything. Instead of one 1MB block every 10 minutes you would have a 0.5MB block every 5 minutes.
Then again, this isn't really "network latency" so I'm not sure what you mean there. "Network latency" is a problem for fast block chains because of orphan rates, but it's not related to transactions rates.

Almost. You've tricked the exchange into sending coins without subtracting from your balance, which is almost but not exactly the same thing.


Since a ton of people who are not attempting this attack have also had their withdrawal transactions declined, I think it's a fair assumption that the attackers are simply trying to mess with every single transaction out of MtGox. This would mean that even if you had a system that detected and prevented the attack, you couldn't really ban anyone. The indiscriminate targeting could be an attempt to mask their own double withdrawal attempts, or they're not actually performing double withdrawals but simply tanking the overall bitcoin value in an attempt to profit from a short position.

I never did any calculations on the viability of ordering a mining rig for myself so it's hard to say exactly what motivations people have. Considering people have paid Cointerra the same amount of dollars to get their mining rigs delivered in April, the January batch might have been an extremely lucrative deal originally and still very profitable (enough that people won't actually refund).
Looking at the comparison charts at  it looks like the Cointerra machines are supposed to be 50-100 times faster and 5-10 times more cost effective (in terms of $ per GH/S) than anything currently shipping. As an example, cex.io sells hash rate at ~$30 per GHS/s (with instant delivery) while the Cointerra machines were supposedly $333 per GH/s and now a bit less.
It's also fairly possible that many people didn't do any realistic calculations, especially in terms to the extreme difficulty increases we've been seeing (70 times more difficult now than 6 months ago).

First of all, customers don't have individual wallets on MtGox and most other exchanges. Bitcoins are kept in central wallets* and a database keeps track of user balances. If someone withdraws bitcoins they will send them from one of their central wallets and reduce the account balance in the database. 
This isn't nuts at all, it's perfectly normal. It happens on MtGox and pretty much every other exchange. It's also a necessity, remember that the bitcoin protocol is limited to ~7 transactions per second. Offchain transactions within an exchange is simply the way it will always be. Some people have even predicted that in the future most actual payments will be handled internally on payment processors and actual transactions on the blockchain will only occur when the exchanges send between each other.
With this knowledge I'm sure you understand how MtGox could send out bitcoins several times to the same user when they think the earlier withdrawals didn't go through, and that when they later try to use the same money to someone else, that later transaction fails for real.
*These concepts can be a bit murky as wallets isn't something actually part of the protocol. A wallet is basically just a way to keep track of and send/receive inputs and outputs. Since MtGox uses a custom "wallet" software it could potentially bear very little resemblance to the default client and other wallets.

As a comparison CoinBase stores 97% of their coins in offline storage, and CoinBase is meant to be used as a wallet where there's a lot more transactions in/out. It's likely that MtGox's offline storages are at least as large percentwise.
This would only be a serious problem in terms of solvency if they kept withdrawing coins from cold storage and increasing their "hot wallet" size in order to increase the chance of successful transactions. I seriously doubt they did this.
It would be possible to do a transaction to prove how much they currently possess, but there is not much in doing so and it is really inconvenient. MtGox has alluded that they're using an "m out of n"-method with the cold storage wallets distributed in multiple extremely secure locations.

You're kind of contradicting yourself here. Short block times directly leads to smaller blocks, which is advantageous to "isolated" miners. No matter what you do highly-connected miners will always have a slight advantage, though I'm not able to judge whether twice speed half size blocks is better or worse in that regard.

The value of hash rate isn't some speculative market value at cex.io based on supply and demand, it's directly related to how much bitcoins you can mine with it. The value of owning hash rate is:
(Your hashrate / total hashrate) * block reward * blocks per second.
Block reward and blocks per second is for the most part constant. Since you're owning a specific amount of hash rate that is also constant. The only thing that changes in the equation is the total hash rate (i.e. the difficulty). As the difficulty goes up, your hash rate's value will reduce.
It's possible that the value went down even faster than the difficulty went up as more and more people at cex.io realized how unprofitable owning hash rate was and how overvalued it was, but even without that the value would constantly decline.

There is another theoretical worst case that could be worse. Since difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, it updates every 14 days with a constant hash rate. However, if bitcoin crashes in a way that makes mining super unprofitable and we lose 99% of the hash rate overnight, we could get stuck in a situation where blocks take 16 hours to find instead of 10 minutes, a transaction takes 4 days to confirm instead of 1 hour, and the next difficulty adjustment is 3-4 years away instead of 14 days. This would basically ruin bitcoins completely.
It's very unlikely to happen though. The dropoff would likely happen over weeks/months, letting the difficulty adjust downwards at a normal pace. Even if mining was unprofitable, a lot of people would probably still keep going for a while.

That wasn't how it worked, you wouldn't have received double accidentally.

Miners will always accept any block size up to 1MB that was produced by someone else, but they can choose their own block size freely. You could choose to produce up to 1MB, you could choose to never include any transactions at all, and the other miners will still accept your block.
This changes the default maximum size in the bitcoind program, so that miners that use the default value will now sometimes produce larger blocks than earlier. However, most miners didn't use the default value anyway so this won't change much.
If you produce a block larger than 1MB, it will be discarded and miners will continue building on the previous block. If you changed this hardcoded limit, the first time someone produces a &gt;1MB block the blockchain would fork because only the people with updated clients would accept the block. If this was less than 50% of total hash rate the older chain that discards the &gt;1MB block would eventually catch up and replace the new chain. If more than 50% of total hash rate accepted the block, the two groups would be forever building on different chains.
Typically, when something requires a hard fork like this you will implement it so that it doesn't go into effect before a majority has the new version. For example, when the difficulty changes every 2016 blocks, if more than 75% of the blocks since the last difficulty change has been produced by people with the new version, start producing and accepting &gt;1MB blocks.
At this point I'm not sure there's even a consensus that the block size should be increased, so we're quite a bit off from this.

It simply doesn't work at all because there's no way of knowing who is actually mining a block.

@_date: 2014-06-23 11:30:41
No, you don't. The number of confirmations needed for safety is not dependent on the difficulty or average block time.
The original reason for a relatively long block time was to reduce the number of orphans. Every time a block is found, parts of the network will be working on the "wrong" chain until the block has distributed across the entire network. This is inefficient, and a security risk in itself.
10 minutes was chosen arbitrarily because at the time, it seemed like a good trade-off between orphan rate and confirmation time. With the mining pool super nodes and generally better network connections these days, I think most would agree that a shorter block time would be better. The advantage wouldn't be that important though, so as far as I know no one is really trying to change it.

Except, you know, food is useful for eating, land is useful for growing/living on, hell even gold is useful for building electronics plus it makes beautiful jewelry. A lot of things have intrinsic value.
Bitcoins (the coins, not the protocol) has no intrinsic value. USD also has no intrinsic value, but at least it is backed by something. The fact that bitcoin is not backed by anything is a valid argument because it means they could more easily become worthless.


Yes, you can use dollars for illegal activities too, but bitcoins are very anonymous and very much suited for illegal activities. With bitcoins there's not even a need for money laundering. The fact that a lot of criminals haven't started using bitcoins yet is probably more due to lack of technical knowledge. We will need to come up with solution to stop criminals from hiding behind bitcoin's anonymity.


I'm not aware of anyone with an IQ over 80 claiming these are problems with bitcoin.


You don't seem to get the argument here. No one is claiming that the purpose of bitcoin is to scam people out of money. Very few is claiming that the inventors of bitcoin created it to become rich once the value increased enough.
While some people may use the "ponzi scheme" term, what they generally mean is more like a bubble. The concern is that the vast majority of bitcoins are owned by people who own them not to use them, but because they hope the value will increase. Basically, what you get is this:
* Person B buys 1000 coins for $10 each from person A because he hopes they will become worth more in the future.
* Persons C1-C10 each buy 100 coins for $100 from person B because they hope they will become worth more.
* Persons D1-D100 each buy 10 coins for $1000 from persons C10-C100 because they hope they will become worth more.
Nothing has really changed about bitcoins, but they have increased hundredfold in value just because there are now a hundred times more people who think they will become worth more in the future. This looks a lot like a ponzi scheme because B and C1-C10 got in early and profited, while if everything crashed D1-D100 will be left with nothing. To make it look even more like a ponzi scheme, B and C1-C10 typically promoted bitcoin heavily and made it sound like a great thing in order to get more people that wants to buy it.
This might technically not be a ponzi scheme or even a scam because there's no central authority initiating and promoting it, but it could definitely be a bubble and that's very dangerous by itself.

As you say it's mostly pointless anyway because you can mix and exchange the coins if needed. If you're just listing individual addresses with theft reports, it's trivial to get around just by moving the coins once. If you're tracking coins across transactions, you can taint honest addresses by sending stolen coins to them. Also it's too easy to abuse by submitting fraudulent theft reports which cannot be verified easily.
Exposing an address involved in a theft such as the recent chrome extension is not a bad thing by itself, but trying to create a "stolen bitcoin registry" is never going to end well. You don't want to make people scared of accepting bitcoins for fear that they're receiving stolen coins.

You haven't understood how the flaw allowed people to steal from MtGox. If they had 50k in the hot wallet and 25k of it was stolen, they would still think they had 50k in the wallet and there would be no need to dip into the cold storage to replace the lost coins. In this scenario when half their coins are actually gone, a ton of withdrawal requests fail due to being double spends of coins that are no longer there.
In theory, it's possible that they transferred funds from cold storage to mitigate the failed withdrawal problem without properly investigating what caused the failures, but that would be even more moronic than what you describe.
The only way that the amount could possibly be correct is if there was never a cold storage at all, and in that case the document would still be wrong.

They didn't exactly try to knock over NTP. They abused some NTP servers running an old version of the protocol as a bandwidth amplification tool. Basically, by sending just one ~200 byte message you could generate 100 response packets for a total of 48kb data. Together with IP spoofing, they directed the responses towards the servers they wanted to attack.
This problem was fixed 4 years ago and all major NTP servers are running on versions much newer than that, meaning they couldn't be used for that. Of course, this doesn't mean it's impossible to attack NTP servers to prevent bitcoin applications from functioning properly.

Short version: 0.8 included new restrictions on transaction ids causing some of MtGox's transaction ids to be invalid and the transactions to fail. Some people eventually figured out that you could "fix" these transactions and re-transmit them.

The same could have been said for MtGox up until 10 days ago, and I'm sure that's what most people who lost their money to an exchange being hacked or their house catching fire or their laptop being stolen were saying until it happened.
Everyone has different needs. Depending on how much bitcoins you have and how much technical expertise you have the best solution will be different.

Two things:
1. Mining cost balances out with electricity costs and mining rewards so that it's slightly profitable to mine but not more. This means that as rewards go down the mining cost will go down.

Blocks would not be empty, what would happen is that transactions with too low of a fee would be excluded. Zero fee transactions can already take a long time to be included, because of exactly this. I'm not sure why you would think that game theory isn't at all applicable to bitcoin mining. Every single miner might not be a rational actor, but a significant amount will be and the number will keep increasing as mining gets increasingly commercialized.
However, this isn't a viable comparison. If 90% of miners refuse zero fee transactions, they'll take an average of 100 minutes to be included. If 99% refuse them, they'll take 17 hours to be included. As long as there are some remaining "ideological" miners, they'll eventually be included. Meanwhile with your suggestion, it's enough that a majority downvotes a miner and it can never ever win any rewards.

You misunderstand the protocol. Before the other party will send you the $1000, you need to deposit the 1 btc that you're selling, plus the 1 btc collateral.

I do agree that this sucks for anyone who had coins there. It's fairly obvious that the incompetent development isn't going to stop anytime soon so I'd recommend everyone to withdraw their 87.7% and then the rest when given the opportunity.

At my bank I can access my transaction history going years back, including Swish transactions (obviously there are no Swish transactions that far back, but you get my point). While it's possible that btcx doesn't care about your identity, the same could be said for any other exchange. The key is that if you buy coins at btcx there is a permanent link to your real identity if anyone wants to use it.

While I admire your optimism, continued operation has never been a real option. To continue operating (via a rehabilitation) enough money would have to be infused immediately to make the company solvent, and the value of the missing funds are way above what anyone would value the company at even if you include future profits. If enough creditors would have agreed to depreciate their holdings this would have made solvency easier to accomplish, but that's simply not feasible with 127 000 pissed off account holders.
The only realistic solution since some time is to distribute the company's remaining assets to it's creditors. An external company like Sunlot could in a liquidation buy the bitcoins, the domain name, the source code and/or the hardware, but this would not come with any obligation whatsoever to the existing creditors. The trustee would distribute the payments to the creditors and from the court's view it would be over after that. The buyer would use what he bought as he saw fit. This has never really been what Sunlot was interested in though. They have always wanted to continue operating the company via a rehabilitation.

Their press release is not bullshit. While it's very possible to program around the design issue and it was definitely their responsibility to do so, there's no denying that this is a flaw or even a bug in the current code. There is no valid reason to change the transaction id and doing so without altering the hash should not be allowed if it can be prevented. The only misleading part of their statement is this:


**Most wallet and exchange services** will keep a record of this said hash in order to be able to respond to users should they inquire about their transaction. **It is likely that these services will assume the transaction was not sent** if it doesn't appear in the blockchain with the original hash and have currently no means to recognize the alternative transactions as theirs in an efficient way.
Most well-coded wallet and exchange services does (hopefully) not use the transaction id to track their outgoing transactions exactly because of this issue. Most likely some do though.

Kind of. Most sites keeping anything of value should hopefully have some sort of two-factor authentication system available. For example, google/gmail will let you register a phone number on your account. This would let you reset your password using a code sent via sms to your phone. While it might still be possible to steal the account with the stolen information by claiming you lost the phone, this should at least give you warning from the sms that let you take action.
Other sites that hold valuable information should hopefully have similar security. Something like a bank would probably even require you to show up at the office and show your id there. Unfortunately the reality is that in some cases accounts need to be recoverable even if you lost all the authentication methods used. The id/utility bill system is kind of shitty but there aren't many alternatives.

Fiat withdrawals are notoriously difficult, sites like PayPal and Neteller that are considered respectable had huge problems with stuff like that for years.
The failed withdrawals are cause by the earlier "double withdrawals". Someone withdraws money but changes the transaction id. This prevents MtGox from verifying the success of the transaction using their flawed method of using the transaction ids, so they think that they still have the funds available (and they restore the user balance). When someone else tries to withdraw money and they try to use the inputs they think are still available, the transactions fail.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:02:11
Well, if someone tries to replace the blockchain further back than a checkpoint, people who respect that checkpoint will simply not accept the new chain. If someone still tries, it will lead to a fork, and the new chain will effectively be worthless as it cannot be used to send transactions to updated clients (and payment processors will surely be updated). It's conceivable that something similar could be implemented in the algorithm itself.
I'm not saying it's easy, I'm just not willing to rule out the possibility.

I don't see how they would accomplish this. Without going into liquidation, creditors would still be entitled to the entire amount owed. They can't just independently decide to write down all debts by 83.5%. If a significant majority of creditors agreed to exchange their debts for equity, it could be possible in theory, but they would still have to pay off the ones who didn't agree. It would also be extremely difficult logistically to get something like this off the ground, considering the international and anonymous nature of the creditors.

No it wasn't. It had nothing to do with trying to avoid bad press. MtGox re-sent the funds (or put them back in the account) because they sincerely thought that the transaction had failed so that they still had the money and the person withdrawing didn't receive any. It's also fairly likely that this was an automated process, though there's no definite answer on that I believe.

Savegox is completely weird. I listened to the podcast and this is either people completely disconnected from reality or an elaborate scam (or both). I'm not even sure where to start with all this. First of all, and most importantly, they seem to be under the impression that it's somehow ok to keep operating the company in an insolvent state. It's not, and no court would allow something like that to happen. Their "worst case scenario" where they take control, distribute the 200k btc and whatever else remains and throw the company under the bus, would constitute fraud in pretty much every single jurisdiction. If a company is insolvent, the court is the one to distribute its assets. Donating away all of the company's assets according to your whims before the court can take control is extremely illegal.
Secondly, I don't understand why they would do this or why they would think it's financially viable at all. MtGox will never again reach any significant trading volumes. The cost of investigating, auditing, rebuilding and operating the site would be pretty huge. How can they think that they could possible recoup any of their investment into this? Even at the height of its trading volume, it would take decades to pay pack all the customers. Why would they invest millions of dollars to start operating an exchange that is hundred of millions in debt, and has a terrible reputation?
Thirdly, looking at savegox.com there's a ton of marketing which is at best misleading and at worst complete lies. I went looking for sources and found  Rather than 10 years, the average process takes 1.2 years. Rather than getting 3% back, it seems to vary wildly (see page 37) but generally be around 10% for unsecured creditors. More things worth noting here is that the majority of bankruptcies has a significant number of secured creditors, for example banks that lend money with a property lien as security. These have full priority and often get back 100% of their owed money, severely diminishing what is left to the rest of the creditors. MtGox should not have a significant number of secured creditors, so that doesn't apply here. Lastly, companies normally does not have hundred of millions in unsecured debts like MtGox did. Most companies have virtually no assets left when they go into bankruptcy, and as such cannot pay out much to creditors. MtGox has at the very least 200k btc, which is extremely unusual.
I'm really not sure what to make of all this. I came up with a few speculative explanations: 1. They'll gain control and disappear with 200k btc. 2. They're betting that given access to all of MtGox's assets, they'll be able to find more coins hidden/forgotten somewhere that they can take without anyone noticing. 3. They won't actually invest anything, they'll use parts of the 200k btc for operating expenses while taking a cut from trading fees for personal profit.

Shrug, it goes up and down. Some periods have had over 30% increases consistently, though recently there have been some 5% increases too. All the other number used ($40k buy-in, $500 reward, $50 maintenance) are also rough estimations, but conceptually what I said still applies. Any attempt to invest in cloud mining or your own hardware will cost more than what can mine before difficulty increases makes it unprofitable.

The difficulties of depositing and especially withdrawing fiat currency makes it almost impossible to have risk-less arbitrages. If you did not already have significant amount of fiat on btc-e, there was no way to get it in there before the price rebounded almost completely. Even if you did have the fiat available (which is a risk by itself), there's always a risk that other exchanges will follow the crash before you can offload your btc there (unless you can execute simultaneous buy/sell orders. It's also fairly likely that someone DID in fact take advantage of the arbitrage and caused the rebound, they just didn't have the buy orders placed in advance.

That's normal, very few people could name more than 20 current parliamentarians (out of 349), even less candidates. Right now he's "only" a local politician. In the 2010 election he was number 2 on the list for his district but the party only got 1 seat from that district. In this election it seems that the previous number 1 is a candidate for the local government instead, so he moved up to number 1. I would assume that this also means that his party liked what he did when he worked in parliament as a replacement for 8 months in 2012.

No, that's not what I'm saying. The $150 that the buyer pays to the development company needs to cover a lot of stuff other than the developer's salary. He needs to have an office to work in, and he needs computer equipment that needs to be replaced sometimes. Also various administrative costs for someone who takes care of invoices and payments, makes sure the coffee machine is working, and so on and so on. Also you won't be able to bill 100% of a full time job, usually anything over 80% is considered pretty good. You might also need someone to work sales to try to promote your developers and win contracts.
In the end, if you charge $150 per hour the developer might get somewhere between $4k and $10k minus taxes per month. Given that you probably spend a lot on that it takes quite a while to become a millionaire just from being a salaried developer. I don't actually know the hourly rate that theymos pays of course, he could just as well be paying $200 per hour for 3 developers or $100 per hour for 6. Depending on what country you're in and exactly what you need the rates can vary wildly.
If you did the development "inhouse", apparent development costs might be lower, but then you'd have to provide the office, computers, administrative personnel etc. Also it would probably be pretty difficult to hire someone for a short-term project like this. It's fairly reasonable to outsource this kind of development. Software development is a fairly competitive market and if it was easy to make a profit charging less than what they currently do, someone would do it.

Again, how useful is this really without any proof of fiat reserves? Example:

2. Someone steals 50BTC.
3. Kraken uses $25 000 to buy back the 50 BTC at another exchange.
4. Kraken still has proof of reserves for all their BTC, but they're actually insolvent and could go down at any time, taking the BTC balances with them. This would typically happen if enough people withdraws fiat currency.

That's what I was referring to, and the short answer is that it wouldn't. They would never ever be allowed to continue operating the company in an insolvent state. To continue operating they must be able to cover every single cent that they owe creditors within a reasonable timeframe (few months maybe?). This could include voluntary agreements with creditors to exchange debt for equity but that would never cover everything they need, especially if they don't want to tap into the 200 000 bitcoins they have.
Normally, when a company in bankruptcy is bought out (sometimes for just $1), the buyer basically agrees to cover existing debts out of pocket because they believe they can make the company profitable in the future. Basically the brand, the workforce, the infrastructure and the customer base have value that the buyer is hoping to cash in on. Sunlot has no intention of paying any significant amounts out of pocket, so the prospects for a rehabilitation/reorganization is non-existent. It's extremely unlikely that anyone would be willing to cover 650k missing bitcoins out of pocket, which is why the court indicated that liquidation is the likely outcome.
What confuses me is how they can even think that something like this will ever work. I mean they have a lot of resources and have actual attorneys working for them, so I don't really get it at all. They're basically applying to conduct a customized liquidation without any oversight.

Yes, but that would never happen for a significant part of the creditors. If the remaining 200k btc would give creditors even 20 cents on the dollar that's worth far more than shares in SunGox would be. You should realize that the only reason Sunlot is interested in this is that it would essentially be a zero-risk venture for them. They would buy MtGox for a symbolic amount (1 btc) and then try to take whatever money they can out of the company while also paying back creditors small amounts. Their plan for solvency is basically convincing/forcing account holders to freeze the bitcoins and have funds unfrozen as they are earned from fees over an indefinite amount of time (read infinite).
Some people think that trying to sell off 200k btc would crash the market and mean very little fiat would be repaid, which is why alternative solutions could be considered. It's hard to make any concrete suggestions without even knowing how to treat fiat vs bitcoin creditors, and it's unclear if the trustee would care at all about the suggestions anyway. Possibly things like this could be voted on at the creditor's meeting, assuming they produce a reliable way to show proof of debt.
I wouldn't pay too much attention to what anarchystar aka Olivier Janssens says. He implies that his lawsuit represents 3611 plaintiffs owed a total of 284274.15 bitcoins (plus fiat), but the reality is more akin to 3611 people signing up for his newsletter while entering unverified account balances that he has no way to check. He claims to speak for these people without having any legal authority to do so. He also takes credit for things that he had nothing to do with, such as the 200k btc found and even the fact that MtGox was put into bankruptcy. The only thing that makes him special at all is that he's apparently rich enough to hire some lawyers that files various documents that no one probably cares about.

It's worth noting that there's a known exploit where you can create transactions where the time increases non-linearly with the size of the transaction. For 1MB blocks the time needed is a manageable ~3 minutes, but for larger blocks the time becomes a problem quickly.

Basically, in every block there is already 991.6 kilobytes of transactions with a fee of 10 sat/byte or higher (on average). If you wanted to block all transactions with fees below 10 sat/byte, you only need to fill that remaining 8.4 kilobytes of space.
Similarly, in every block there is already 918.6 kilobytes of transactions with 20 sat/byte or higher fees. To block out everything below that you need to submit 81.4 kilobytes of transactions at 20 sat/byte.

The purpose would likely be to damage the bitcoin infrastructure, either for political reasons or possibly as a part of some greater scam that gets helped by it.


That would make it roughly 5 hours to verify that one transaction. The verification time grows with the square of the transaction size, so if you make the transaction 10 times bigger it takes 100 times longer to verify.


Quite hard. A miner can't just unilaterally decide to orphan a complex block, because if other miners don't he's wasting his time and money working on a shorter chain. If many miners agree that the block should be orphaned they could do it, but they would have to agree on some specific definition of what blocks to orphan or we could end up with a block that only half the miners considers too complex and the rest keep working on. If the miners do come to an explicit agreement about defining this sort of thing it's a hard fork and is better done as part of the original hard fork to increase block size. Being caught off guard could be disastrous as that could force you to abandon relatively deep chains in hindsight and invalidate transactions with 6+ confirmations.

Well, I'm not aware of anyone having their money stolen by MtGox until very recently. They operated for 3 years without losing anyone's money. Having technical issues isn't a sign that they are untrustworthy.


That kind of depends on how much bitcoins you have.


Not really. Savings accounts are insured (up to a limited amount) but as far as I know only against bankruptcy. If a bank employee steals your money I don't think FDIC insurance will protect you. Also you wouldn't really keep your investment money in an insured account type anyway as the interest rate tends to be quite low. The safety of dealing with a real bank comes more from the fact that banks tend to be huge companies with decades of successful operation, and that you can reasonably expect that the bank will be held accountable from mishandling of your money.
The reason exchanges are risky is not because they're not insured, it's because they are new and unproven, small, and located halfway around the world from you. Also unlike banks they aren't independently audited.

I understand what you mean, but it's not possible to implement something like that. Consider this:

3. Person B pays person C 90 units to clean his house
4. Person C deposits those 90 units in his bank account.
How is the bank to know that person C's deposit is not a "hard deposit" but is sourced from money already loaned from the bank? Is that even a meaningful distinction to make?
It should be mentioned that "creating money" can also refer to that when someone takes out a loan, the bank doesn't actually fetch money from a huge vault and give it to him. They'll just edit the sum of money in his account. On the bank's books, there's an asset in the loan and a liability in the cash in the account. This can be considered money creation but it's a natural consequence of the fact that most money is just as numbers in a database.

In general, the cost of an attack depend on what you want the required fee to circumvent your attack to be. It's impossible to completely block out transactions. To determine the cost of raising the "minimum fee" we look at how much fee transactions are currently paying.
* 10 satoshi/byte: 99.16% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 10 sat/byte you only need to pay 0.00084000 btc per block (~$50/day),which is almost nothing. In reality transactions below and maybe at this level are included for other reasons than their fee, such as miners own transactions, CPFP, priority or something else.
* 20 satoshi/byte: 91.86% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 20 sat/byte you need to pay 0.01628000 btc per block (~$1000/day), which is real money but not a ton.
* 30 satoshi/byte: 75.86% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 30 sat/byte you need to pay 0.07242000 btc per block (~$4500/day), starts to add up but still realistic.
* 40 satoshi/byte: 66.79% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 40 sat/byte you need to pay 0.13284000 btc per block (~$8200/day).
* 50 satoshi/byte: 24.28% of included transactions are paying this much or more. If you want to block transactions below 50 sat/byte you need to pay 0.37860000 btc per block (~$23400/day). At this point it seems like a lot of money, but in a billion dollar industry it could still be very worth it if you think it is accomplishing your goals. This is what you would need to severely disrupt the network, as you would block out all the transactions between 200-250 byte with a 0.0001 fee.
It's worth mentioning, that it's unlikely that you would actually have to pay for 75% of the block space in the end. If you filled the mempool with 50 sat/byte transactions, people who really needed to send a transaction would start paying 51 sat/byte. Exactly how many people would be willing to raise their fees is more or less impossible to predict so the actual cost for an attack is hard to estimate.
I'm not certain exactly what fees the spammers are currently using in the attack. Since transactions with only 10 or 20 sat/byte are still getting through it would seem the majority of the mempool is below this level, possibly as low as the minimum relay fee of 0.00005000. Still, it seems transactions with 30-40 sat/byte are being included slower than usual, so there is also an increased amount of transactions above this level. The spam transactions were spread out over time, the mempool did not instantly rise to the highest level, and they may also have been spread out across fee levels.

Just conceptually, for something like reddit gold there doesn't really have to be a risk. When the double spend happens it should be possible to revert the delivery of the goods, basically removing gold from the account or whoever he gave it to. This would obviously need to be implemented together with the party delivering the goods, but since it should be in their best interest to continue accepting 0-conf it doesn't seem like an insurmountable problem.

Not exactly. As the transaction is non-standard miners won't include it by default, so the attacker would have to mine his own block or convince another miner to include it. Even if a miner did include it, 3 minutes of extra verification time won't ruin bitcoin, and in future updates you can hardcode the client to skip of that particular transaction.
So with 1MB blocks, it's not a critical issue and not a ton of work has been put into solving it. The only concrete proposed fix that I know about is to put a cap on transaction size. I'm not sure exactly what 2ndEntropy is talking about but requiring higher fees would not prevent the attack as the attacking miner cannot be forced to follow these fee requirements.

There are two important parts basically. The first is that you must have access to cheap electricity, which is typically accomplished by living close to hydroelectric power plants and not having high taxes. The second is that it can help a lot if you live in cold climate where the energy pumped into mining is also useful for heating up the building.
If those things are true for you, the scale doesn't really matter a ton. The price of mining hardware usually doesn't go down a lot just based on volume, so you can be profitable with just 1 miner. If you are planning on doing it at home your power lines probably can't handle too many and you should check to make sure that you have what you need before buying.

First of all, bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver and is pretty much bitcoinunlimited.com at this point. Any polls conducted there can be expected to have a very biased pool of answerers. Since bitcoin unlimited haven't been around forever, that core used it in the past doesn't mean much.
Secondly, around 0.1% of bitcoin holders supported bitcoin unlimited in that poll if I'm not mistaken.

Basically, in a fractional reserve system the bank must keep a percentage of the deposits in "reserve" (10% often used for examples, in reality it's more complex). This means that if someone deposits 100 units, they can lend 90.
When people talk about money creation in regards to the fractional reserve system, what they mean is usually the situation where the 90 units that are lent out are eventually redeposited in the bank in some way, for example by the person the loaner paid. 90 gets redeposited and the bank can then lend 81 of that again. However, it's important to understand that in that situation there are deposits of 190 rather than 100. 190 is deposited and 171 is lent out, so they reserve 10% and lend 90%.
You never explained your line of reasoning for why you believed banks can lend out more than gets deposits so it's hard to say where in that reasoning you went wrong.

Yes, I'm saying banks can't lend out more than they have in deposits, in fact they can't even lend out all the deposits. They have to keep a fraction of it in reserve, which is why it's called fractional reserve banking.
Regarding the Northern Bank crash, that's not true and I'm honestly not sure where you would get that idea. The problem with Northern Bank was that they borrowed money on short-time contracts and lent it out on long-term contracts such as mortgages. Basically, if people want to withdraw their money you can't just take it back from someone you loaned it to.
Generally everyone isn't going to want their money back at the same time, and you keep part of the investments short-term so that you can adjust to how much money you have invested. In this case the bank failed to predict how the market would evolve and they were unable to renew enough short-time financing. Instead they were forced to apply for a liquidity loan that would lose them money but keep them going while they sell off enough mortgages to restore liquidity.
The problem in that case was that liquidity loan created a panic with investors and depositors in the bank being scared of losing their money. A ton of people simply transferred their money out or withdrew it which worsened the liquidity issues and caused the bank to collapse. The situation was mostly under control under this bank run happened.

Yes, simplified it becomes like this:
* $1000 deposited, $900 lent out
* $900 deposited, $810 lent out
* $810 deposited, $729 lent out
* $729 deposited, $656 lent out
* $656 deposited, $590 lent out
* $590 deposited, $531 lent out
* $531 deposited, $478 lent out
Even if we stop at this point for simplicity, we have total outgoing loans of $4694, but it's important to realize that we also have total deposits of $5216, not just $1000. 10% of that $5216 is kept as a reserve and the rest is lent out. Exactly the same thing could happen in a fractional bitcoin bank. As long as the bitcoin lent out is redeposited the bank can re-lend it again.

The attack would probably come from a miner in the first place, so not mining them isn't a solution. Orphaning blocks only to a certain depth via a soft fork like that needs a supermajority as the other chain always gets a head start, and it can be problematic because it creates a lot of opportunities to double spend with 1-2 confirmations.

If you refuse to follow a judge's orders he can find you in contempt of court and place you in detention indefinitely or until you comply with the orders. This is not very common but it happens regularly to citizens in the United States. 
For example a man in Philadelphia was held for at least 2 years between 2015 and 2017 when he refused to decrypt his external hard drives. As far as I know he's still behing held, because if he was actually convicted or acquitted there should have been some update. So 4+ years is possible.
The 2-3 days you speak of only applies to charges being filed after an arrest. Obviously, OP had charges filed within days or hours of being arrested. If he had refused to comply with the court order to surrender his keys, he could still have been held indefinitely even after his initial sentence (probably longer than 24 months) was served.

SWIFT itself cannot be used to send actual money, so there could never be a SWIFT bailout. The funds themselves that were sent as the result of the SWIFT payment order can not be recovered from the sender side. Depending on what has happened to the money since it arrived in the receiving account, it might be possible to recover it from there. In most cases like this however, the thieves will naturally have prepared for that eventuality and try to move the money out of reach of such solutions.

In general some small amount of inflation is considered a positive thing, for example Sweden has a goal of 2% inflation. There are various reasons why this is the case, one is that this inflation makes it possible to lower wages when needed. Telling people that you're gonna give them less money isn't gonna fly, but if you give them a 1% raise they'll be happy or at least content even if inflation is 2%.
A negative inflation also makes it difficult to stimulate the economy by lowering the reference interest rate. If the federal reserve lowers the interest rate from 1% to 0.5%, more people are going to invest their money instead of saving it in an interest account. If you lower the interest rate from -0.5% to -1% it's not going to have much of an effect.
Too high inflation is also considered a negative thing that brings its own problems, and worst of all is unpredictable inflation. You want a steady, small amount of inflation.

"When it's safe". The problem is that out of the last 10 BCH blocks mined, 9 came from the same pool or miner (whose identity is unknown). It would be trivial for such a miner to doublespend the deposit transactions and basically steal money from the exchange.
It won't be safe to accept deposits until there's a multitude of different miners mining blocks at a steady pace where no one organization/individual controls close to 50% of hash power. At this point the mystery miner seems to have stopped completely or switched back to the bitcoin chain, so it's unclear if anyone except ViaBTC is still mining (and they lost more than half the hash power on the BCH chain). I would be surprised if anyone will actually enable BCH deposits within a week and personally I doubt it will ever happen.

It's important to note that the estimates given by those sites are just that, estimates. There will never be any fee that guarantees you get included in a certain amount of blocks. Generally the estimates are given in the form of "If you use this fee there's a 95% chance you get into the next 3 blocks". This prediction will be correct 95% of the time, but incorrect 5% of the time. If fast confirmation is very important to you, you can use an even higher fee to make it 99% to get into the next three blocks or even the next block.
In this case, when you posted the transaction there was probably a high chance that you would get into the next 3 blocks and an almost 100% chance you would get into the next 11 blocks, but you just got very unlucky.
One thing to note is that there's almost always a large number of transactions with a 44.44 satoshi per byte fee since this is where you end up if you pay a fee of 0.00010000 for a "standard" 225 byte transaction. Because of this you can expect transactions with a 45 s/b fee to confirm much faster than those with a 43 s/b fee. The fee you used lies at a very inefficient place in terms of the fee/confirmation time tradeoff.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:51:42
Sources for what? You cannot include transactions in your mind block before you have figured out which ones were included in the previous block. This means every time a block is mined there is a short period where it's not possible to safely mine blocks with transactions.

Until you can show me at least one of those, I will have to assume that every single one of them does spend unconfirmed transactions. There is simply no miners that intentionally include a lot of lower fee transactions over higher fee ones. Occasionally, no block will be found for 30-60 minutes and in that case it's obviously normal that transactions will have waited that long. If no block is found within a long time, I suppose it's possible that a 60 s/b transaction could miss out once (twice or thrice is increasingly unlikely). 3+ hours simply should not happen at this point and until you can prove it the default assumption is that you're lying.

One thing to note though is that trading was still done between different investors, ViaBTC only took the normal fees and as a result probably didn't profit much if at all. I also think that tokens like this are a good idea for hard forks, just not soft forks. The Bcash token they offered worked out great and it was the first of its kind.

For the token to have any value it required that the BIP148 chain split off from the main chain. This never happened as miners decided to start enforcing segwit signalling before August 1st. Theoretically, there's still roughly a day left before Segwit locks in, so if miners would disable their segwit signalling enforcement at this point BIP148 could split off. You could use this to argue that there's still a point to the 148 tokens.
In practice there's no chance of this happening, which is why the 148 tokens are "worth" roughly 0.0005 bitcoins each.

You're almost right, but not exactly. If the transactions in the block you are building on are invalid, it doesn't really matter if you include transactions in your own block or not.

That's not true at all. 60 s/b is pretty much guaranteed to get you into the next few blocks. If such transactions are not confirmed after 3-12 hours there's likely another explanation, for example they may be spending the outputs of an unconfirmed transaction with a lower fee.

Miners profit from reduced difficulty so if anything they should exploit it in the other direction. For example keep faking all timestamps at 00:00:00, 00:00:01, 00:00:02 and so on, then at ~10 you start faking timestamps at 12:01:00, 12:01:01 and so on. Using this method you can force 6 difficulty decreases (total 74% decrease) every ~12 hours regardless of how many blocks are found.
I think this is also unlikely to happen though, partly because you need more than 50% of mining power to do it and partly because it could easily erode all trust in the chain and make coins worthless. More realistically miners will stop mining for a day or two to let difficulty go back down on its own.

Well, just like with BCH the Segwit2x hard fork is done via a "flag day", it activates at a specific height regardless of how much support there is. So it's pretty much guaranteed to happen. There is of course a risk that hash power is not enough to sustain the chain to a difficulty change and that everyone stops mining it. This risk also exists for the  SEGWIT1X_FROZEN tokens though. Personally I think the risk is higher for the 1x chain as 2x has a lot more miner support as it's looking right now.

I wouldn't exactly call it complex. All you have to do is create a RBF transaction with nLocktime and once it gets confirmed on the "slower" chain you replace it on the other one.

They were the ones who created it, so as a result they also had to pay for it. There was no support for creating additional prizes in Alfred Nobel's will and even if there was I doubt the foundation would have created one for economics as it can be sort of a "soft science". But for some reason the Swedish central bank wanted such a prize to exist so they created a new prize which is now called called "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel". The foundation handles the administration of the prize for a fee of around $1M USD per year, in addition to the prize money.

That one was a soft fork. The only candidate for the one hard fork was the BIP50 change to the database configuration in 0.8.

Basically, the fact that the same coins are being moved hundreds of times in the same block. Someone has X bitcoin and want to split it up into a large number of addresses. That by itself is nothing weird, but typically you'd want to do this in as few transactions as possible because of fees.
So for example if you have 1000 btc and want to split it up into 10 000 parts of 0.1 btc each. You could do this in a single transaction, but it would be extremely large and maybe a little impractical. You might choose to do it in two steps. First split it up into a hundred parts of 10 btc each, then a hundred more transactions each one splitting each part of 10 into a hundred parts of 0.1 btc.
However, that's not what is happening here. Instead, they're creating 10 000 chained transactions, each one sending 0.1 btc to the final address and the rest to a change address. This is an extremely inefficient way to do it and wastes a ton of money on fees unnecessarily. It has no real purpose in terms of transferring money, it's just disrupting the network by slowing down transactions who don't use proper fees.

Absolutely, but:
1. In the short term, LN is nowhere near ready and we cannot afford to wait that long for a capacity increase.

Running bitcoin core is fine. The program understands segwit and will follow when it activates. There's no advantage to running a BIP148 node and there's a (at this point insignificant) risk that you will fork yourself away if miners stop signalling Segwit.

One problem with that is that SPV wallets will default to the chain that does not require a new ForkID on all transactions. If Segwit2x will become the dominant chain and the Segwit1x chain dies off, which is not an unreasonable assumption, you forced every wallet to release new versions needlessly. If both chains survive, you may lose out on a lot of users who kept using the same wallet.

UASF was not successful and had virtually no support in almost any category.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:01:23
First of all let's get the terms cleared up. UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a way to introduce new features. BIP148 that deals with "forced segwit activation" is deployed using a UASF. Many other features could also be deployed via a UASF in the future, but for now it is the only feature using it so the terms have sort of became synonymous.


No, it was not. When BIP148 was activated, there were basically two things that could happen. One possibility was if a majority of miners enforced the ruleset of the soft fork or a compatible rule set. In this case the soft fork would become a Miner Activated Soft Fork. The BIP148 miners will discard all non-compliant blocks and since they have more hash power they will eventually maintain the longest chain. There is no chain split and miners are forced to either comply with the changes or hard fork away to their own chain.
The second possibility is that BIP148 only has support among a minority of miners. In that case, the miners supporting BIP148 would consider the blocks from other miners invalid and not build on them, but they would not have enough hash power to achieve the longest chain. Therefore, there would be two chains, one longer chain where non-compliant miners mine and one shorter BIP148 chain.
The token refers to coins existing on this second shorter chain in the second example. If scenario 1 happened there would be no split and the tokens would be worthless. The token did not specifically deal with a potential PoW change, but I suppose if that happened it might have to be split into two tokens, OldPoWBIP148 and NewPoWBIP148.

I'd say the orphaning solution is worse than lowering the threshold, but we'll have to see and wait if it becomes necessary. 


The arguments against segwit has never been about the merits of the changes, but about the fact that it's tainted by the connection to the impopular core developers. So there's not really a solution to that problem.
@_date: 2016-11-15 16:26:59
Those people could change their mind or their share of the total hash power could change.  But yes, there's a possibility that segwit won't activate. It's possible to lower the 95% threshold, though some core developers have already said they wouldn't want to do something like that. Miners can also force it through by orphaning non-signaling blocks for a certain time period, though that's certainly an abuse of the protocol.
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:36:05
It only becomes 2.1 when every single person uses segwit. Realistically it will start slowly creeping up from 1 MB when it activates but it will take months or years for most users to start using it.

Segwit will not be a relevant capacity increase in the short term because most people will still use the legacy transaction format. Also, all coins must be sent to a segwit address with a legacy transaction before they can be used in a segwit transaction.
I would be surprised in the average block size is above 1.2MB at the end of the year with only segwit. In a long-term perspective, segwit's increase to ~1.7-2.1 MB blocks might have been enough in 2016 when this became a problem, but in 2018 even that will likely be too small.

You can never be seconds away from mining a block. It's not a process where you slowly progress until you complete something. Every hash you do has an equal random chance of finding a valid block even if you or someone else found a block 1 second earlier or no one found a block in a week.

Not easily. Overt ASICBoost is basically just setting random stuff in the unused version bits. If you forbid some version strings, which would be a soft fork, it would make it very difficult to introduce signalling for new features. Basically to even start signalling would be a hard fork at that point.
Realistically a final fix to this would be to change the PoW slightly so that the trick does not work at all.

This is not true, you got it wrong. Verifying a block twice the size generally take twice the time. The issue is that it's possible to craft specific transactions that take a long time to verify, and the maximum verification time you can incur scales quadratically with the size of the transaction. So when you double the block size, it becomes possible to mine a transaction that is twice as large but take four times longer to verify.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:08:32

More important than wallets are the receivers of payments. If a payment processor/exchange doesn't accept segwit it's dangerous to have it in the wallet. I would suspect even after wallets implement it they would wait quite a bit to make it default.
At this point it mostly depends on when segwit activates I guess. If it activates in december it will take a while before the ecosystem is ready. If it activates in 11 months maybe the support is already there from the start.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:39:48
There's still a difference. If Segwit activated at 75% and only stopped orphaning non-segwit blocks at 95% it would have a much higher chance of activating.

To be more specific, what satoshi says is basically just that if you wait 10 seconds and don't detect any double spend attempts on the network, it's really unlikely that someone could double spend successfully. There could be some success still, but probably less fraud than with credit cards.
It's more problematic in a situation where blocks are full and it's hard to estimate if the fee is enough that the transaction will confirm. Plus, even if the store can determine it's unlikely that your transaction will be mined, it has no good way of returning the money if it does end up being mined.
The reality is that on-chain bitcoin transactions are not entirely practical for fast physical payments. A more likely situation is that you have an account at a payment service like bitpay, and that you use a card/chip to transfer bitcoins from your bitpay account to the store's bitpay account. Remember that bitcoin is a currency, not a payment solution. It's possible that off-chain but decentralized and trustless solutions like the Lightning Network can be used.

You only risk losing the funds if you force close channels though.

Again, the miner percentages are mostly irrelevant. As long as exchanges/payment processors/relevant users agree, the miners won't be able to force them to switch. The old 1MB chain can keep going fine with 25% of the mining power (blocks will be slower for a while). They don't have to give a rat's ass about what 75% of the miners do.


Forking with just a mining majority without the actor consensus will likely be a disaster. For example if the trigger was reached right now this is what would happen:
* 75% of miners run XT with larger block sizes, acceptance of those blocks are triggered.
* Block larger than 1MB is generated.
* Coins mined in this branch and coins sent in transactions only present in this branch can no longer be used to pay for goods or be sold on exchanges.
* As a result, the value of XT only coins plummet quickly and they become close to useless.
* Miners realize they're mining for worthless coins, panic and switch back to bitcoin core.
* Eventually the core 1MB chain overtakes the XT chain and a long branch is orphaned and its transactions reversed.


If you during the temporary existence of the XT branch traded tangible physical goods or other currencies for an XT transaction that is later reversed when the branch is orphaned, there could be significant losses of wealth.


This is certainly correct, but the point is that you still need to convince them to accept the larger blocks before you hard fork. Trying to hard fork without convincing these processors/exchanges like XT is trying to do is a terrible idea and it's incredibly dangerous the the entire bitcoin concept.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:48:42
Yeah but that max-out was at 1 mb or close. When the percentage of transactions using segwit goes up, the maximum block size also increases, so that these blocks are 1.3 mb. In theory if everyone used segwit the block size should be more like 1.7-1.8 mb.
This particular record was set because someone has recently been spamming the network with large amounts of low-fee segwit transactions. This means that virtually all blocks are completely full and whatever room there is gets filled with these segwit transactions.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:04:09
It was user error, he shouldn't have tried to force close the channel like that. If the peer was uncooperative the money could have been locked forever, but not stolen. There's not much point in doing that for the peer though.
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:59:44
I was just explaining why people would lie about accepting larger blocks. Yes, you could already do it today, but since there's not a significant amount of miners ready to switch there would not be much gain. The attack would make much more sense if there's already 45% willing to switch and you control 30%.
In the end such an attack is very unlikely now and in the future. I wasn't providing the explanation as an argument.

Yes, it would readjust back after ~8 weeks if it maintains 25% of hash power, could be more or less if miners switch in either direction.

I'm not sure quite what you mean here but it sounds like you have misunderstood how the randomness of mining works. It's not like you have to beat the big actors to win blocks, you just need to start hashing and you will win your fair share.


I think a more similar market is the one for chip production (sort of similar to ASICs). You can see some statistics [here]( As expected there are some large actors like Intel with 14.8%, but there's no total dominance and the top 20 is 67% in total which doesn't seem extreme.


You don't need to control 50% for there to be diminishing returns. If one actor owns 10% and doubles his hash rate, he goes from 2.5 btc per block to 4.55 btc per block (increase of 2.05). A new actor adding the same amount would go from 0 btc to 2.27 btc. This % decrease equivalent to your current share could very well be the difference that makes it unprofitable to invest for people that go above some point.

The miners cannot force new rules even with a majority. As long as there are still a significant amount of miners mining using the old rules, users of bitcoin can keep using the old rules and ignore the fork using the new rules even if it's longer. If the users and particularly the major users like payment processors and exchanges don't switch to the new rules, 75% of the miners are simply mining coins that cannot be used for anything. 25% of the hash power is still enough to secure the network.

Exchanges and merchants will obviously use nodes as they need to be able to see what transactions are happening. If you send money to a deposit address at an exchange, they'll update your balance after seeing the transaction being included in a block and verified X times. If the deposit transaction is in a block larger than 1MB and the exchange's node is running the client with a 1MB limit, they will not acknowledge your deposit. At that point it doesn't matter if 75% of miners and 75% of nodes are using the XT client, because the exchange is not. 
A majority of miners or a majority of nodes is not relevant, what matters is how the important big actors treat it. If exchanges and payment processors stay on the old client, the new XT coins will be worthless as they cannot be used to pay for goods and cannot be converted to other currencies. The branch with large blocks is irrelevant and the branch without large blocks will keep chugging along as if nothing happened except a slowdown until next difficulty change.

Upvotes and downvotes are a good tool to filter content based on quality, but it doesn't work to filter out content that is inappropriate for a subreddit. In general people doesn't care at all what subreddit a post is in when upvoting/downvoting. You could post cat pictures or adviceanimal memes to and it would get upvotes.
Because of this, moderation is needed to keep a subreddit on topic. Almost all subreddits have rules that tries to keep different sorts of content to different subreddits and also rules to improve the quality of posts. This last part is generally done by banning low effort posts like memes, and sometimes even banning image links completely. Most people agree that these rules are effective in improving the community and encourage quality posts and discussion.
have a couple of content rules, for example:
* You are not allowed to ask for donations or post wallet addresses - I think that's a good rule as without it there would be a ton of people trying to solicit money from the generous people of this community. There would be made up stories about children needing medical help, someone who just needs a little bit of cash to buy food, etc etc.
* Trades/sales are disallowed - I think this is a good rule because just because you're accepting bitcoin that doesn't mean your trade/sale is bitcoin related.
* Submissions must be bitcoin related - I think this is a good rule but sadly it's generally not enforced. The subreddit tends to constantly be filled up by news about the NSA, paypal/banks, cencorship/privacy/surveilance and security. This articles usually have no connection to bitcoin whatsoever but because they fit with the "corporations are evil so we need bitcoin" hivemind they frequently get upvoted to the top.
* No posts about other cryptocurrencies - I think this is a good rule in general, because there would be a ton of noise because of posts about dogecoin, litecoin, buttcoin or whatever the current flavor of the month is. is already a fairly large and popular subreddit where such posts should be appropriate, and most altcoins have their own subreddits. Whether Bitcoin XT falls under the altcoin rule is a separate issue that has already been discussed at length elsewhere.
So in conclusion, there are a number of helpful rules that improve the subreddit in ways that upvotes/downvotes couldn't. The enforcement of these rules are sometimes questionable but just because one post was deleted in error that doesn't mean rules as a concept is bad. I would hate to see pitchfork itself to death like did, though it seems unavoidable at this point.

You could have 99% of the nodes but 1% of the hash power.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:39:05


Yes, this is a problem, but only a temporary one.


I did not consider this but people might simply adjust. For one thing the transactions generated by gambling sites would probably go down significantly during the period with longer blocks. There should not be a huge issue to get significant transactions included by raising the fee slightly.


The time to generate 2016 blocks would go from 2 weeks to 8 weeks and on average there will be 4 weeks from the split to the next adjustment. It's not exactly many, many months.
You also make it sound like the two chains are equivalent and you can choose to follow the one with the most convenient block time. This isn't the case. One actor can't really unilaterally switch chain. Who would want to buy coins on an exchange if you could not use the coin with merchants? Which merchant would want to switch coins if they could not cash out into USD with the received coins. The big actors need to agree that either they all switch or no one does.
What would likely happen is that exchanges allow trading with coins from both branches separately. The price for one branch would crash instantly after the split and miners would jump to the one that still had value. Assuming the merchants did not instantly switch I think the new branch is more likely to die this way, though it's hard to say for sure.
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:45:52
The winning side is the branch that payment processors and exchanges use. If 75% of miners uses XT but payment processors and exchanges do not, the XT code will switch you over to the losing side.

No, that's simply not how it works. Look at the difficulty history at 
Many increases have been in the range of 20%-50% and decreases have been as large as 18%. You can see the difficulty change at 2010-07-16 actually hit the cap of a 300% increase.
There is no limit at 4%. A factor of 4 means the difficulty could go from 100 up to a max of 400 or down to a minimum of 25.

To trick people into mining on the XT fork. If a significant amount of people signaling that they're on XT don't actually accept large blocks, such blocks will be orphaned and the hash power used to mine them wasted.

If a difficulty change just happened, it will run for 8 weeks and then adjust down to 25% of the previous difficulty. Assuming 25% are still sticking to this chain it would be normal after that.
If we're 1 week into an interval, it will take 4 weeks to complete. After that, difficulty will be reduced by 60%. The next interval should then take 3.2 weeks to complete before we're back to normal.
So in short, depending on where in the cycle we are it will take 7-9 weeks to get back to normal. This is still a significant period and is a problem, but it's not impossible to tough it out.
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:49:03
No, that's not how it works. The big actors such as exchanges and payment processors are the ones that matters in this case. If you cannot use the coins to purchase things and cannot cash out into other currencies, it doesn't really matter if 20% or 80% or even 95% is mining on the fork.

Coinbase looks like one of the safer choices for this fork, but their treatment of the Bitcoin Cash fork was less than optimal (current plan is to allow withdrawals from January 1st I believe?) Your coins could end up locked for quite a while there. Also as they have firmly supported the Segwit2x, it's unclear what they'll do if there's too little mining to sustain the legacy chain and especially if a PoW/difficulty change happens.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:58:50
If you keep it on Coinbase you have to trust that they will give you access to the coins on both chains after the fork. If you keep it in a hardware wallet you have to trust in your own technical skills to split the coins.

It's in everyone's best interest to acquire more hash power to mine more bitcoins. There can certainly be benefits of scale in producing mining hardware, but economies of scale applies to pretty much any competitive market and there are plenty of such markets that retains a lot of diversity.
For one thing, as your market share increases the benefits of increasing your hash power is reduced. If the total hash rate is X and you have 0, introducing another X will get you half of the mining rewards or 12.5 btc per block. If you already controlled half of the hash rate, you would only go from 12.5 to 18.75 for an increase of 6.25 btc per block.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:18:41
The economics of bitcoin mining is quite a bit more complex than that but now you're at least getting close to the important point; that there's no room for specialization since every hash has an equal value. This is something you did not address in your post and you're not getting to it until many posts into the discussion.
Another thing your post does not address is how bitcoin has existed for quite a while but there hasn't been any strong dominance so far. There are some large pools but it's been much worse earlier and pools aren't even the same thing as true ownership of hash power. So how has it not happened yet?
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:43:17
A majority among the miners is pointless. The important question is what  payment processors/exchanges decide to do. If those big actors stay on the bitcoin core network, you will not be able to use the XT coins for much. This will lead to the value of XT coins crashing almost right away and miners going back to the core network in order to stay profitable.
To successfully increase block size, you need a consensus among the important payment processors and exchanges, not a majority among the miners. Miners trying to force through a hard fork without this consensus will just end in disaster.

A lot of people are gonna be moving over to cash now that the core chain will remain heavily congested with extreme fees.

Once you have had a &gt;1MB block, there will be some transactions that only exist in the fork. The outputs of that transaction can only be spent on the new fork and not the old one. If you can get hold of even a satoshi from one of these transactions you can use it to taint your coins by sending it in the same transaction as the other ones. Thus it will be fairly simple to separate your ownership on the two chains.
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:14:45
Minimal amounts is a thing almost everywhere, but it depends on the type of store. If you go to a large chain, they may have negotiated a better deal with smaller fixed fees per transaction so it doesn't cost them as much. The employee is also less likely to give a shit since the payment method doesn't affect his salary.
But if you go to a one-off small store/restaurant, small credit card payments may hurt them more, and the owner is more likely to care.

Just... no... if you believe this you truly do not understand what the hark fork would do. Confirmation times will take a serious hit on the 25% chain but as long as the value of coins remain there's no reason for miners to switch. If payment processors and exchanges stick to the 25% chain that's where the value will be and the coins on the 75% fork will be the ones useless.


Alternatively, if you have not convinced payment processors and exchanges to switch when the first 1MB is mined, the pressure will be in the other direction. To avoid mining on a fork doomed to be orphaned eventually, miner's will jump back almost right away.
Stop saying that it's "risk free" to switch to XT or that there is "nothing to lose" by switching, because that's just a complete lie.

As you say, the easiest solution for most users is to keep the coins on a service you trust and that will support withdrawals on both chains, and then after the split you withdraw to your Ledger again.

There will be two separate chains. It will be possible to send the same coins on either or both of the chains, though it might be a bit tricky to control it.

To forcibly raise the minimum fee you need to be able to orphan all branches containing low fee transactions. This would require more than 50% of the hash rate, while the attack described can be done with significantly less.

I'll try. You basically start off with the assumption that "Mining will continue to centralize as long as there is profit motivation". This is not in any way obvious and you do not provide any supporting arguments. The rest of your post is based on this unsupported and incorrect assumption.

Is there something you did not understand in the above explanation or why the weird reaction?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:54:38
It's not that difficult for technical users or larger actors to split coins. One of the easiest ways is to use the mining rewards that are only valid on one side of the fork. You acquire a small amount of those coins from a miner, and then you include those coins in the splitting transaction. Such a transaction can never be included on the other fork.
Another reasonably simple option is to create a transaction with a time lock that can only be mined above a certain height, and that also opts into Replace-By-Fee. Once the transaction has been mined on the faster chain (with more hash power), you publish a replacing transaction to another address that then gets mined on the other chain.
The replay attack and lack of replay protection is mostly a problem for less knowledgeable users that do not have the tools to perform this splitting and might make a mistake and lose coins.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:35:23
In this discussion, the miners are simply not all that relevant. If the large economic actors (typically payment processors and exchanges) stay on the old chain, it doesn't matter that 75% of miners stops mining on the old chain. The chain will continue (at a reduced pace for ~8 weeks) and it will be the useful chain of bitcoins. There's nothing forcing or pressuring these actors to switch to the XT chain. The vote of the miners doesn't matter as they can never force the users to switch.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:41:25
The fork is triggered when 75% of miners are using XT, but there's a delay before they start allowing 1MB blocks. The 44% from this post is not clients using XT though, it's just inofficial votes done in inert sections of mined blocks. It's unlikely that these miners supporting 8MB blocks would start using XT, it's more along the lines of supporting a move to 8MB in bitcoin core.

My explanation is simplified, but it accurately explains the core tenets of fractional reserve banking. It is not incorrect or misleading. "Balance sheet expansion" is a term typically used in regards to a central bank printing money and is not used when someone simply deposits money to a bank.
Some features of the banking system, typically those that require involvement of a central bank, are not possible with bitcoin. But the core of fractional reserve banking works the same.

You're right in that the existing fee being paid matters. In my simplified situation I was assuming that X would be much larger than Y, which is one of the more reasonable assumptions. In reality the "attack" would mostly work on a really congested network. Let's assume that for each fee amount there's a certain amount of people willing to pay it. Again we assume 1000 tx per block. The numbers are obviously made up to show a theoretical point.
* 0 fee - 1100tx.
* X fee -  1000tx.
* 2X fee - 900tx.
* 4X fee - 800tx.
* 8X fee - 700tx.
* 16X - 600tx.
* 32X - 500tx.
* 64X - 400tx.
* 128X - 300tx.
The basic fees earned for each block with no manipulation is 1000X. If you control 25% hash rate, you will profit 250X with this. However, if you create 100 transactions with a 2X fee per block, you will force 900 people into paying 2X. This costs you 200X but you will get 500X back per block 1000\*2X\*0.25. Your new profit will be 300X which is better. You could also try to get the fee up to 4X by sending in 200 such transactions, but this would cost you 800X and the return would only be 1000X for a profit of 200. If you controlled 40% of the hash rate, your profit unmanipulated would be 400X, raising the fee to 2X would net you 600X and raising it to 4X would give you 800X.
In the end the percentage of hash rate and congestion needed depends on the initial fees and the sensitivity to price increase for the users. The effect of this attack could be summarized with:

No one can print actual onchain, M0 bitcoins. Just like banks (except central banks) cannot print real M0 dollars. Banks/exchanges can artificially inflate the M1 bitcoin supply, just like they can inflate the M1 dollar supply. This artificial inflation of the money supply is sometimes referred to as money creation or printing money, and works with both dollars and bitcoin.

There is zero need for IOUs in fractional reserve banking. Fractional reserve banking works fine even if merchants only accept onchain btc or actual physical gold.
The same applies to verifiable gold-backed dollars. The fact that every bill must be linked to actual gold in a vault is mot a problem for fractional reserve banking because every dollar bill is actually backed by gold. The only unbacked money is that in custodial accounts. If you disallow custodial bank accounts or require dollars in bank accounts to be backed by gold, then yes, you have prevented fractional reserve. But just like you can't verify the backing of dollars in a bank account, you can't verify that bitcoins in a custodial bank account are backed by onchain bitcoins.

Person A deposits 100 btc into a bank account. The bank keeps 10 btc as a reserve and lends 90 btc to person B. That person pays person C 90 btc for some good or service. Person C deposits the 90 btc into his bank account. The bank keeps 9 btc as reserve and lends 81 btc to person D. This cycle can repeat a number of times and the final money supply expansion factor depends on the reserve percentage.
So as you can see, it works exactly the same as it does with dollars, just replace btc with dollars in the above explanation. For gold, it's exactly the same explanation but with some other unit.

I agree that it's unlikely to actually happen as miners are more reasonable than the people here on reddit, but the promotion of this non-consensus hard fork is still problematic. If you don't want this catastrophic hard fork to occur before processors/exchanges are on board, then why use and promote a client that could cause exactly that? That's like voting for Donald Trump and saying it's ok because while he's crazy other people won't vote for him so he'll never actually become president.

Again, the existence or usage of some separate "IOU bitcoin" is not necessary for fractional reserve banking. The onchain bitcoin supply that is fixed at 21m is similar to the M0 money supply. The badly named "creation of money" in FRB is only an expansion of the M1 money supply, and it would work exactly the same with an M1 bitcoin supply that was no longer limited to 21m. This doesn't mean people would go around paying each other with some IOU bitcoins. It just means bitcoins in your bank account is counted toward the M1 supply even though they have been lent out and is no longer fully backed by onchain coins.
When you pay a merchant from your bank account, the bank will reduce your account balance and broadcast a transaction from their hot wallet to the merchant's receiving address. This will reduce the banks reserve percentage and could force them to sell off investments to get back to the percentage required by law.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:46:54


I'm not sure how many times I need to say this. IOUs are not part of fractional reserve banking.


Obviously, fractional reserve banking only works if people actually trust banks enough to make deposits. This is true for both dollars and bitcoin.


I guess that's true, though it doesn't change the fact that fractional reserve banking is possible both with physical gold and bitcoin, without using any IOUs.

As stupid as banning encryption would be, this argument is equally stupid. The point is that finding and charging terrorists is very difficult, especially if they encrypt their communication/data. If you can arrest and charge them for just using the encryption, there's no longer a need to prove they are terrorists. If terrorists can no longer legally use encryption, it's much more difficult to communicate without getting noticed.

To be clear, this method of doublespending only works if the fee was so low that nodes and miners will reject it. If the fee was high enough that it gets accepted into the mempool it generally can't be double spent.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:43:41
There's a slight bump which is not unusual and not really a problem. That doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of the new transactions are no/low fee transactions that was never meant to be confirmed and is basically just hanging out in the mempool for 72 hours until they get thrown away.
Even now we can see that there were 5 recent blocks that weren't even full because the miners don't include these transactions at all.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:57:48
There was a sudden huge increase in transaction rate but all those new transactions are low fee ones that will probably never be included in a block.

Basically, Bitfinex lost $850 million dollars somehow, and to keep them solvent Tether lent them roughly that amount in newly minted USDT that had no backing. As long as Bitfinex is running at a profit and eventually pays the USDT back to Tether, it's possible there is no issue. If there is a redemption run anytime soon on USDT, Tether would be unable to fulfill all requests and USDT would quickly lose almost all value. If Bitfinex is unable to continue operating with profit, they may never be able to pay Tether back and as a result Tether could go bankrupt and USDT only gets redeemed at a percentage of the original value.
There is an additional concern in that Bitfinex would have been kept operating the company while insolvent, which is typically illegal. This could result in Bitfinex getting shut down, which would lead to similar results with Tether also going bankrupt and USDT holders taking a haircut. There may be some loophole that they're exploiting to prevent this scenario though.


They did say that many times, but not sure if it was part of the terms. The terms state that there are circumstances in which they could refuse to redeem USDT.

I am not, but I don't believe that would happen even if the block size is increased significantly. For example, I'm currently running a full node on a 100/100 connection. Even if I wanted to limit bitcoin to using 10% of my upload capacity, it would allow for ~1 MB/second or 600 MB for each block period. So even with a 10 MB block size I could upload the entire block 60 times to different peers.

I suppose that if the funds are only frozen or temporarily seized while an investigation is ongoing, then technically you are not insolvent.
In this case the $850 million wasn't seized from bitfinex though. They sent the money to Crypto Capital who never delivered it to the recipients, and as a result bitfinex had to restore the user account balances. Crypto Capital is claiming that the money has been seized by various governments, but the details are unclear and it's completely possible that bitfinex never gets this money back.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:05:33
Worth noting is that this isn't part of the consensus critical code, and nodes will forward transactions with unconfirmed inputs just fine. This means that it's up to each miner if he wants to take advantage of CPFP. As it's financially beneficial to do so we would expect most to do so, and it's probably mostly an implementation issue at this point. You also don't need global adoption for it to be effective, if 10% of miners uses it you can expect your transactions to become unstuck in ~10 blocks.

It seems you are correct about how it works.

@_date: 2015-07-16 09:47:13
It does make sense, at least if you make some (flawed) assumptions. Let's assume that a block can fit 1000 transactions and that right now there are 600 in each block (more than half filled). Then you flood the market with transactions with a fee of X which forces everyone else to also pay X. In each block you will now pay 400X in fees on your flood transactions, and gain 1000X\*market% back. That means that if you have more than 40% of the hash rate, you can make a profit doing this. I'm not sure what he's on about with the golden ratio but basically you can afford to pay for a percentage of each block equal to your share of the market.
There are flaws though. First is the assumption that people will just accept being "forced" to pay higher fees. In reality a lot of the transactions will simply go away if you try to make significant raises. Still, if you control a specific market percent there's always the point where there are enough people willing to pay to get into a block.
Secondly is the problem with increased mining profitability. Since you are effectively raising the profit for all miners at your own cost, other people will invest in additional equipment until you can no longer afford these flood transactions.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:38:32
No that's also untrue, but for other reasons. There's not actually 985k separate bitcoins in the mempool. Looking at [this block]( which fixed half of it most of it is a single 2000 bitcoin source being split up into many many pieces over a bunch of transactions. For example one transaction might send 2 btc to and asdress and 1998 btc of change to another address. Then another transaction spends those 1998 by sending 2 btc to one address and 1996 btc of change to another.

The situation right now is that 0.0001 fee transactions have a good chance to get into the next block, but if the miners are unlucky they might have to wait 1-2 blocks extra. With a 0.0002 fee you are almost completely guaranteed to get into the next block.

The alternative view is simply incorrect. If you use the bitcoin to pay for something or simply give the bitcoin away, you have not broken their terms. The person who received the bitcoins has also not broken their terms as he never agreed to them in the first place. The point is that it's impossible to know whether you are just jumping the bitcoin around between wallets or if you are transferring it to another person.
Also, there's no law prohibiting them from providing payment services to gambling sites, even if you transferred the coins directly there instead of using your own wallets.
They are of course free to deny you service based on any or no reason, at their discretion. But that could be bad PR as evidenced here.

I think what he's getting at is similar to the theory of 'memes' as defined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene. If you are not familiar with that wikipedia gives this basic definition:


Basically, units of information like a cultural ideas, symbols, or practices are transmitted between different brains and databases and thereby replicate similar to how genes replicate in biological reproduction. While corporations are owned by shareholders they generally do not make a huge impact on the brand and its business practices. If the largest shareholders of those corporations would sell all their shares you would likely not see a big difference in the company itself. Therefore it could be said that companies live a life of their own and have become their own entities. The employees, representatives and assets are just vessels that the meme uses to operate and spread.

You're not getting it. In terms of fractional reserve banking, dollars and bitcoin are EXACTLY equivalent. 


No, they wouldn't. When you deposit money on an exchange today (which is the closest we have to a bank), you don't see exactly what happens to the coins. You just see what the numbers say on your account page, and those don't reflect the coins in storage at the bank.


As always, the purpose of the reserve percentage is to avoid this. If you have thousands of customers and keep 10% in reserve, then a very large amount users would have to withdraw to create a bank run.

In 5 or 10 or 20 years the tools available will be mature enough for non-technical people to properly use bitcoin. For example the users might be redirected to their bank and authenticate with their 2FA method and the bank executes the payment using the necessary fees. Or more likely the receiver will have an account at the same or a connected bank and there might not even be an actual on-chain transaction.
In the current state you need some amount of technical skills and education on how bitcoin works to be able to perform custom transactions like this, and if users attempt and fail because of insufficient skills/knowledge, the blame lies mostly with them.
I don't expect the average consumer to understand exactly how a microwave works, but if someone tried to build their own microwave in the 40s and hurt themselves, I'd put the blame mostly on them.

If they wanted to disconnect Segwit2x nodes a couple of days before the fork to make the transition smoother I would be fine with that. Disconnecting them months in advance is just combative and disruptive.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:38:01
I think that if core wrote a Segwit2x implementation, the current btc1 repository would probably be abandoned after the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:19:00
I think a factor 1.7 in terms of fees is not a big concern for most users. So people don't care much about $0.25 or $0.15. They probably also don't care that much between $5 and $3. They might care about $5 or $0.25 but that's not something they can directly affect just by using segwit.
I think the most important reason adoption is slow is that most wallets don't support it and larger actors like exchanges and payment processors haven't really started using segwit for their deposit addresses or internal addresses. It also doesn't help that every single coin started out in a non-segwit address of course.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:23:46
The lack of support for Segwit is completely unrelated to Core developers refusal to support a hard fork block size increase. Even if miners had activated Segwit in the first available window, Core would still refuse the hard fork block size increase.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:04:15
Actually I misspoke, it's more like 5% of transactions is segwit which means more like a 2% capacity increase.
Regarding future adoption, I believe it when I see it. It could just as easily plateau at a low level since most people don't really care to start using it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:10:21
It's not impossible to implement replay protection and Segwit2x will use opt-in replay protection so that it's easier to create Core only transactions. If Core wants to it can implement similar opt-in replay protection making it possible to create Segwit2x only transactions.
The linked comments are about the fact that Core 0.15 will refuse to communicate with alternative implementations, even if they're fully compatible with Core. Basically they're trying to force every node to use Core software. The predictable result of this is that alternative implementations will identify as Core nodes.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:06:52
They did not. Block size is still ~1MB. At this point it's clear that Segwit did not effect any significant short term block size increase.

I hereby state that any change to BTC must go through me first.

@_date: 2017-09-28 14:00:17
Which is why it's good that the opt-in replay protection is added. For most inexperienced users it's probably best to transfer coins onto some platform that does the split for you though.
Don't forget that even two-way replay protection doesn't make it trivial to split the coins.

Bitcoin won't replace banking, but it does to a large extent make central banking impossible.

Yes, that's exactly it. If you control 5% of the hash rate currently you will find a block every 200 minutes on average, and there'll be 19 other blocks inbetween on average. If the other 95% leaves and let you mine on your own, you will still find a block every 200 minutes but there won't be any other blocks inbetween yours.

The Classic/Unlimited nodes will follow the longest chain, so if Segwit2x gets more than 50% of the hash rate Classic/Unlimited will support that. This assumes the EB parameter is 2MB or larger or that you have a non-infinite AD.

It was obvious to everyone involved that the agreement meant Segwit with 8 million block weight i.e. 2MB base block size and the 4x discount for witness data. This has been made clear since then, but I agree they should have made it clearer in the agreement.

Certainly, but the code needed for that is not in the current release of Core. Since we're already getting pretty close to the fork it's a bit late to try to code up such a method and get it deployed on a significant number of nodes in time.

Fair enough. At least it's a non-default configurable option. 90% of nodes will signal Segwit2x and the remaining 10% can function as linking nodes connecting to both sides of the network similar to 0.14 clients.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:55:11
Yes, as the currency inflates your debt would be worth less. However, the interest rate is basically completely correlated with inflation. If the interest rate was 5% with no inflation, when the inflation goes up to 20% the interest rate will go up to 26%. So you would be forced to extend your loan to be able to pay the interest, and you end up with a mortgage for the actual same amount still.
If your interest rate is bound long-term and/or the inflation rate unexpectedly rises to extreme levels, you might be able to gain something.

There's no doubt that there would have been a lot of support for a hard fork in 12 months, before the New York Agreement was made. Even in the months after the agreement, it's likely that the signers would have mutually agreed to abandon the agreement in favor of a hard fork in 12 months. At this point though, with just over a month left for the hard fork, it's probably a bit too late.
Part of the problem is that "Core" is not very trustworthy in these matters. A lot of people would see a promise of a 12 month hard fork as nothing more than a way to delay it with no intention of following through with the hard fork. Basically just a way of buying time while continuing the campaign against the block size increase.
At this point, I think the biggest delay the NYA signers would even consider is to use the original "6 months after segwit" timeline. This would mean delaying the hard fork from November to February. It's far from certain that even that would be accepted though, and there's approximately 0% chance that the Core developers would agree with it.

Yes, and the reason is that normal lotteries pay out less money than they take in, so you lose money by playing them. Asic mining can effectively be a lottery where you have an edge and on average get more money than you pay. Therefore, the "tax on stupid" idea isn't applicable.

The problem is that this new transaction style would not be understood by current software. You would force every user to have to upgrade their software so be able to use bitcoin properly, and in many cases there would be no upgraded version of that particular software that worked.


You can get around this trivially by first creating the Core-only transaction and then once that transaction gets confirmed you can send the coins somewhere else on the Segwit2x chain. Also, even without any sort of explicit replay protection at all it's not that difficult for experts and businesses to split their coins, so this sort of feature is more intended for the amateur user.

@_date: 2015-09-05 20:02:22


Sure they can. You deposit 100 bitcoin and the bank holds 10 in reserve and lends 90. The borrower buys something for 90 bitcoin and the seller takes the 90 bitcoin and puts them into the same or a different bank. Of these 90, the bank again holds 10% as a reserve, and lends out 81 to another person. Then when those eventually get deposited they can lend out another 72.9 bitcoins, and so on. At that point the bank has lent 90+81+72.9+...
Fractional reserve banking is perfectly compatible with bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-05 20:43:08


Typically you have thousands of different depositors and borrowers, so they would have more than enough reserves to give your 100 back. The fact that you take out your money means their reserve level goes down, so they might have to collect on some debts or sell some investments to get it back up again.
If everyone who deposited wanted to withdraw at the same time you have a problem (just like you would with normal banks).


Banks do not just magically create money out of thin air. When people say "banks can create money", they just refer to this sort of multiple lending of the same asset that increases the money supply. If someone withdraws money from a bank, they will give them cash from the reserves and then sell off assets to maintain their mandated reserve level.

Because in a Big Bank it's almost impossible to pin a specific crime on a specific individual. There are so many people involved in the organization that it's very difficult to prove that someone intentionally laundered money or was negligent in allowing it to happen. As for a civil suit, they tend to become extremely complicated, lengthy and expensive. For this reason the government will often try to settle the cases, which has happened with Big Banks.

Yes, the current limit is arbitrary, but it's important to realize that there's no block size that will guarantee everyone a spot.
Determining the natural limit using market forces should "work", but I suspect that most people advocating big blocks would not be particularly happy with the end result. As long as subsidies are high there will be a relatively high block size since the dollar value of bitcoin is more important than the fees collected, but when miners rely entirely on fees for revenue the "market forces" solution is to force high fees by limiting block size. There may even be cases where it makes sense for market forces to make minimum fees part of the consensus code or to impose intentional delays on low fee transactions enforced by consensus code.
What I'm trying to say is, it's very dangerous to let miners vote on consensus code.

The bank balances are just as fake as the bitcoin balances would be. In the limited example with just one depositor and one borrower, when the bank loans out the $1000 it would be impossible for person A to withdraw his money because the bank no longer has it. When he looks at his account, it says he has $1000 but in reality the bank has lent out that money.
In a more realistic example 1000 people have all deposited $1000 for a total of $1M and the bank have lent out $1000 to 900 people for a total of $900k. 1000 people can see $1000 in their account and 900 people can hold $1000 in their hand. The total is $1.9M and I suppose you could call the account balances fake if you want. Each individual can withdraw their $1000 since the bank has $100k in reserve, but it would be impossible for all 1000 people to withdraw at the same time as the bank simply doesn't have that much money.
So let's try the same thing with bitcoin:
Person A deposits 100 btc so his account balance shows 100 btc. The bank loans 100 btc to person B so he has 100 btc in hand. Person A's account balance still shows 100 btc, but he would not be able to withdraw it since the bank has lent out that money.
In a more realistic example 1000 people have all deposited 100 btc for a total of 100k btc and the bank have lent out 100 btc to 900 people for a total of 90k btc. 1000 people can see 100k btc in their account and 900 people can hold 100 btc in their own wallet. The total is 190k btc and I suppose you could call the account balances fake if you want. Each individual can withdraw their 100 btc since the bank has 10k btc in reserve, but it would be impossible for all 1000 people to withdraw at the same time as the bank simply doesn't have that much bitcoin.
The 21 million cap for bitcoin only concerns the M0 supply, the M2-M3 supply of bitcoin can be expanded just as easily as the dollar supply. In fact probably a lot easier because there's less regulation.

Fractional reserve banking is just as possible with bitcoin as with dollars though. If you deposit 100 btc in a bank account and they lend 90 btc to someone else and keep 10 btc in reserve, that's more or less the same thing as what's happening with dollars.

No, it should not, only $1000 should be frozen and the remaining $129k would be available for legal defense, hookers and cocaine. The problem arises when your total remaining assets is only $500. In that case all of it would be frozen and you could not pay for your defense.

Expanding the money supply is not the same as creating money. Could you give me an example of how banks can loan out more money than they have?
Since banks could do exactly the same thing with bitcoin, would you also argue that banks can create bitcoin and loan out more than they have?
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:24:02
I would argue that calling it "money creation" is inaccurate, "money supply expansion" is a more accurate term for the effects of fractional reserve banking. If I have $100 and lend $90 to you, claiming that I have just created $90 is inaccurate and misleading.
If someone made a fractional reserve bank dealing in bitcoin rather than dollars, would you still claim that the bank is creating money as it loans out people's deposits?

Now you are talking about civil forfeiture which is a completely different thing. In that case the money is actually seized, and the state frequently does it even when there is no intention of going to court to actually win the money.

No one is saying: "200 000 people want to go see this football game for free but the stadium can only fit 100 000 people so we need to make the stadium bigger so everyone can come see the game for free." You increase the ticket prices as much as you can while still selling all or almost all of the seats. If you want to distribute some amount of tickets via other means such as promotions or to kids or whatever, you're of course free to do that just as a miner is free to include any transaction (and in the past high priority transactions were included even with a low/no fee).

The damaged party gets the money. In this case the company defrauded the government by abusing the medicare system, so the government is the damaged party.
I'm still not sure what you mean by "above the amount". If you are seeking $40M in damages, normally they would only freeze $40M to ensure that can still pay the damages if you lose. If the judgement ends up only being for $20M they take that much and unfreeze the rest. The money never leaves your accounts until you lose, you are just unable to use or move it.

When you are in full control of all the timestamps this can be accomplished fairly easily. It would be pointless though because the formula was changed from number of blocks to most total work (in version 0.2 or something I believe?)
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:20:32
There are definitely limitations, for example if blocks were 1GB large it would be impossible for most nodes to keep up. And even with 1GB blocks there could be demand for 1.1GB of transactions every 10 minutes in which case the highest bidders would still be prioritized. Infinite block sizes are impossible and without infinite block sizes it's impossible to guarantee that every transaction will be confirmed.

If there is a (reasonable) dispute concerning the ownership of something, it's often reasonable to place it in some sort of escrow until the dispute is resolved. In this case this is done by freezing the money.
In addition to freezing assets, you can also arrest and jail someone before they are proven guilty. This is also reasonable, because allowing a murderer to run free and keep killing people every day until he's finally convicted months later is simply not an acceptable solution.

The scenarios are absolutely different, I was just providing an example of why it's reasonable to take action before a judgement even even if the system is based on presumed innocence. I would argue that in some situations it can be reasonable to freeze someone's assets to stop them from squandering or hiding them in the face of an upcoming defeat.
As for preventing someone from proving their innocence, the trial isn't supposed to be dependent on how much you spend, which is the root issue. Your chances in court are better if you have a lot of expensive lawyers, but the right to a fair trial does not include the resources to provide that. This is a problem both for people that have their assets frozen and people who never had any assets in the first place. Both are unable to spend the money necessary to have an adequate defense.
Still, we cannot have teams of lawyers working for months on the defense of every petty criminal. It's a complicated issue and there's no perfect solution.
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:16:40

The negativity surrounding it comes from the fact that it was initiated by the core devs, and that it has been presented as an alternative to a block size increase.

The reality is that banks have thousands of depositors and loaners to protect themselves from this. If 10 000 people all deposit $1000 so that the bank has $10M and the bank lends out $9M of that, it's not a problem when A wants his $1000 back because the bank has $1M in reserves. The entire $9M also won't be kept in long-term loans such as mortgages. Some of it is kept in short-term low-interest instruments that the bank can sell off at any time if it needs liquidity. And worst case the bank can take out an overnight loan from the federal reserve to ensure proper reserves.
This process will certainly expand the money supply. Even if A won't withdraw his $1000 he will live and spend as if he owned that money even while B is actually spending it, something which couldn't happen with pure cash. However, calling it money creation is in my opinion misleading and unhelpful.

Plus, even if he did pay with a credit card or something traceable the domain registrar has little reason to give it out to people asking. If they kept the record it's possible a government could obtain it, but as far as I know satoshi has never been suspected of a crime that would warrant such investigation.

The concept of tainted and untainted assets is flawed at best, as people will attempt to spend the tainted assets in place of the untainted ones and thereby launder the money.
That being said, I don't necessarily agree with the government here, I just said that it's not as simple as invoking the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial. For one thing people who never had any assets in the first place have to make do with a shitty public defender and that doesn't infringe on their right to a fair trial. There are good arguments for both sides and the best solution isn't obvious, which is why it has made it all the way to the supreme court.

This is wrong, specifically the bolded section. Since difficulty is the same on both chains initially the amount blocks mined with a specific amount of hash power will be the same until the first difficulty adjustment. It makes sense to mine on whichever chain has the highest coin price.
AFTER the first difficulty adjustment, it may make sense to switch chain. Assuming the prices on the two chains are remotely similar, we may see quite a bit of weird switching back and forth for the first few weeks.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:40:54
Updated miners will not accept the blocks that break the new rule. This means that if an old miner finds a block which breaks the rule, updated miners will keep mining on their own chain, while old miners mine on the block which breaks the rule. Therefore, if less than a majority of miners update, all updated miners will be permanently mining on their own chain which leads to sort of a fork.
If more than a majority of miners update, they will regularly overtake the "old miner chains" and the real chain will follow the new rules. Old miners will still find blocks, but if that break the rules they will be discarded when the new chain overtake it.

Like, if you paid your brother $100M to represent you in court before losing. I'm sure there's some sort of protection against situations like that, but if you have a team of 100 people legitimately working on your defense it's a bit different.

Without Segwit2x, BIP148 would be dead in the water and not really matter at all. The Segwit2x team chose to make their fork compatible with BIP148 because it's an effort to compromise and get everyone to support the same thing rather than fight over whose changes are the best.

I'm not aware of any such crime.
The "innocent until proven guilty" doesn't work in all cases. In addition to freezing assets, you can also arrest and jail someone before they are proven guilty. This is also reasonable, because allowing a murderer to run free and keep killing people every day until he's finally convicted months later is simply not an acceptable solution.
The root issue is that your chances in court are better if you have a lot of expensive lawyers, but the right to a fair trial does not include the resources to provide that. This is a problem both for people that have their assets frozen and people who never had any assets in the first place. Both are unable to spend the money necessary to have an adequate defense.

Huh? That's not how it works... It takes roughly 10 minutes for one random miner to find the block after they start mining. There's no reason to think miners would wait though because they can easily create 1.1MB of transactions on their own to include.

We don't have any way of knowing what software miners are running. It's likely that many miners are running custom software that may or may not include the hard fork.
It's likely that most miners will keep their word and hard fork as specified by Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:15:12
If miners decide the software is too risky to run in July they'll just wait a couple of weeks or a month for more testing and development. Getting it to activate before August 1st is convenient but in no way necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:01:54
Yes, the block would be valid as it does not spend any coins from segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:42:20
There's simply no way to make a transaction valid on both chains. All transactions on the BCC chain must contain things that make it invalid on the bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:00:26
He's referring to the 2x part of Segwit2x, the increase in block weight to 8MB that happens 3 months after Segwit activation. When Segwit activates Segwit2x and Bip148 will follow the same chain but after 3 months Segwit2x will hard fork away. This hard fork is what luke-jr refers to as an attack.

The reason why this gets brought up so much is that it seems so easy to copy the entirety of Western Union but use bitcoin as a backend in transaction/exchange layer.

It's still exploitable in its current form though. You can speed up the 2016 block periods to something like 6-10 days (I think, the math is complicated) and not just once, but every time. Miners are strongly incentivized to do this, and not only does the disrupt the coin generation schedule, it also disrupts transactions as there will be a couple of days every period with almost no blocks.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:07:32

We don't know how many is quitting. Most of them are strongly opposed to the 2x hardfork part of Segwit2x and a few have threatened to quit if it goes into effect. It's also the fact that they're losing control over the "reference client" and may no longer be able to change it as they wish. If they feel like the the Segwit2x/btc1 team has a vision they do not agree with and they cannot gather enough support for their ideas they may quit.
Another possibility is that they try to keep the bitcoin core chain alive after the hardfork and if necessary change the difficulty and/or the PoW to keep the chain running, effectively splitting bitcoin into two currencies. In that case they can keep developing the core software according to their vision and hope that if their currency becomes technically superior people will switch back to using it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:01:38
Bitmain is not very involved in Segwit2x and has very little control over it. The biggest risk to Segwit2x right now is if Bitmain backs out and goes for their own Bitcoin ABC client instead.

@_date: 2017-07-28 15:48:47
Your analysis gets the facts wrong. The difficulty only drops if it takes more than 12 hours to find 6 blocks, i.e. more than 2 hours per block. For this to happen hash rate needs to drop by more than 90%. The re-balance also does not work as you claim, it only drops by 20%, not 50%.

No, as we said that's not how it works. If a segwit block is 4MB large, it would have taken (almost) 4MB with the current format too.


Because if you want a 4MB block you'd need to have 4MB witness data and 0 MB non-witness data, and that's not how most transactions look. More realistically, a segwit block might have 1.6MB witness data and 0.6MB non-witness data which means a block weight of 4 million but a size of 2.2MB.

Incorrect. Entangling does not happen instantly. The collapse of the waveform of the entangled particles happens instantly, but that does not enable FTL information transfer and isn't what they were doing here.


Again incorrect. The transfer of quantum data was accomplished with traditional means, which was what they were trying to do. Previously, to transfer quantum data you had to transfer the actual particle that represented the quantum state, which is problematic because it's hard to do without losing the state.


Again, the transfer did not happen FTL in this case.

I have no trouble imagining what the world would look like without such laws. If you were allowed to make and sell unlimited copies of a movie, it would be impossible to sell DVDs for more than the raw material cost. If you were allowed to screen a movie for an audience the movie creators would earn nothing. The result would obviously be that any sort of high-budget movie would never be created at all.


This is completely incorrect. Expensive research would in many areas be completely impossible because you would just bankrupt yourself. After you spend millions or billions on creating a new pharmaceutical drug there would be companies selling generics for production cost on day 1. You could no longer gain a competitive advantage from research and as such very little research would happen at all. The situation quickly becomes a race to the bottom/tragedy of the commons type situation. It's beneficial for society as a whole that research takes place, but because it's a losing proposition to do research the equilibrium lands at no research.
There are some companies such as SpaceX that does not rely on patents and are instead able to keep their technology secret, but that does not work for most industries. For many industries the only way to conduct research would be to have it publicly funded in the interests of society.

That depends on how involved the owner was. If it's a normal hotel where there are thousands of "normal" guests and occasionally an escort meets a customer in a room without the hotel knowing, then they're not liable. Especially not if they take steps to ban the escorts when they find out about them. This is similar to google not being liable for copyright infringement even though you can find torrent files by searching.
If there's a hotel where the majority of customers are hookers/johns and the owner knows all about it, then he's probably liable for some sort of procuring crime. Especially if he's making a lot of profit from it and is relying on this illegal activity to operate. This is similar to how most torrent sites including thepiratebay and kickasstorrents operate.

Just to explain some things to people who don't hang out at twitch:
* Twitch chat is a classic IRC server with a javascript front-end.
* This bot is an IRC bot that parses the chat and moves funds between users. 
* In order to see the messages the bot needs to be in the channel when the message is sent. The messages are not persisted in any way that you could read after the fact.
* Twitch policy forbids bots from joining channels uninvited. Doing so leads to a ban.
* Even without the policy it would be problematic to join millions of channels, most without any activity.

This isn't something US specific and it's not as bad as you think. There are various crimes that you can commit over the internet without being in the country. You can steal from someone, you can defraud someone, you can assault someone (threaten to kill them). In many of these cases involving people in more than one country, you could get tried in either country, but the country where the victims are tend to be the ones most interested in going after you.
There are also various offline crimes that can get you prosecuted in the US even when committed abroad, such as counterfeiting US currency or having sex with a child.
In general though, you can only be extradited for things that are illegal in both countries, and the US will only actively go after you if there's some US involvement. You won't get extradited and prosecuted in the US for using drugs or hiring a prostitute in Amsterdam, for example.
I'm not certain what the Ukrainian copyright laws or extradition laws look like, but if this is not illegal there he might have some grounds to contest the extradition in a court.

Asset freezing is also based on concepts similar to reasonable suspicion. You cannot simply unilaterally freeze someone's assets for no reason, you must show in court why you think you can achieve a judgement for the frozen amount.
The sort of freeze in question here is not very similar at all to the abomination which is civil forfeiture, where the state will often seize (very different from freeze) funds even when it never intends to bring a court case.
On a side note, it's sort of sad that you use "pragmatic" as an insult...

Because for the content creation industry to function they must have some guarantees that they can profit from what they create. It would be completely impossible to shoot movies if movie theaters and dvd producers did not have to give you money. 
This is similar to how some amount of patent protection is a good idea to make it worthwhile to invest in research and innovation.

You're probably just missing luke's dishonest terminology. Luke has unilaterally declared BIP148 to be the only true bitcoin chain so even if he was the only one running it, the BIP148 chain would be the only true bitcoin chain and every other node and miner are "attackers". Any miner that doesn't mine on the BIP148 chain is attacking the network. When 99% of miners "attack" his BIP148 chain he'll change the POW and difficulty so the chain can survive.
To any rational observer this is of course ridiculous and it's pretty much a given that if Segwit2x fails to activate in time BIP148 is dead in the water and any user will have to uninstall the client and go back to something else.


Just a quick note here, normally a hard fork require 51% of mining power to "go its own way". Otherwise the miners would repeatedly re-organize to the longer legacy chain since it's still valid. In the case of Segwit2x however, they're doing it as a hard fork+soft fork by forcing the first block to be larger than 1MB. This means that Segwit2x miners/nodes will break off on their own chain even with 5% of hash power.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:15:02
The change is exploitable, but I disagree that it's unnecessary. Without it there's virtually no chance at all that the BCC chain would survive as the minuscule hash power makes it impossible to reach a difficulty adjustment within a reasonable time.
As it is, it's exploitable because miners can spend 12-48 hours or so lowering the difficulty before finishing the period in 4-10 more days. Assuming the numbers are tuned so that it's impossible to create 2016 blocks in less than 2 weeks without increasing the hash power, the change is entirely reasonable. Mostly they just need to make the period longer.

BIP148 is dead in the water if Segwit2x doesn't activate in time. It has virtually zero support among miners so very few if any blocks will be created after the fork. Any remaining miner or important node will jump back to the main chain soon after. Bitcoin ABC is pointless as the BIP148 chain will die on its own.

There's no *need* for a new PoW, but the original statement was that things like the coinbase reward and PoW will always require a hard fork to change. For example of you wanted to change bitcoin to have a 2% inflation per year, or if you wanted to start using scrypt instead of SHA-256. Not because we need these things, but because we wanted them. The original point was that it's impossible to make everything possible via soft forks, since that basically means there's no defined consensus requirements.
Isn't the definition of a soft fork that the old version accepts the new blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:50:53
That's incorrect. Old nodes can still see where the funds are going. They just can't verify that the sender actually owns the coins, but as long as miners enforce that part the nodes will be fine.

It's hard to predict exactly what will happen, but if 80-90% of miners support the hark fork I don't see how the core developers can keep the legacy chain alive even if the users considered their development skills to be better. And if that happens it's hard to see how they could continue developing a reference client that nobody uses, especially when the good features get merged into the Segwit2x client.
My prediction is that the legacy chain will fail and that there will be a major governance reform soon thereafter. Some of the core developers will be invited into the new inner circle of devs and some will leave bitcoin completely.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:22:53
My prediction is that miners will drag their feet a bit too much for the activation to happen before August 1st, but sometime in late August or September they'll activate Segwit and then in the first half of 2018 hard fork to 8MB block weight with the witness discount also applied to legacy transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:31:05
That's not exactly true. While every node will be Segwit compatible that doesn't automatically mean they'll use segwit transactions. Also, since every single address in use right now is non-segwit people will be forced to use a non-segwit transaction to move it into a segwit address. We can expect that to take some time.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:21:33
BIP148 has 0% chance of working without the help of segwit2x, ZERO PERCENT. There simply isn't enough miner support for it to have any chance in hell of being viable. So if you refuse this suggestion you don't get BIP148 and there's no telling if you ever get any version of segwit.

When the chain is re-orged there's definitely a possibility that other transactions are affected. Since you would effectively be throwing away 10 hours of blocks or so, the mempool would get huge right away and transactions that were already confirmed with 20+ blocks could end up not getting in and dropping out of mempool after 72 hours.

It's easy enough to invalidate the blocks that the old version produces just by having a magic flag in the new version, so you could orphan all or all non-empty blocks produced by the old version.
I'm still not sure how you would get the old version to accept the new coinbase reward/proof of work though. Are you saying that you would still produce the old proof of work but have an additional new one somewhere in the block where the old version doesn't do anything with it?

The first release version of Segwit2x will only include quite minor changes to the client as agreed upon in New York and soon after. There hasn't really been a whole lot of commits so the raw number of committers is of course small. If the client becomes the dominant bitcoin client it is likely that many more developers will start contributing, and there's nothing stopping them from merging changes made to the client in Core's repository.
The consensus process for Segwit2x was that a bunch of influential actors met in New York to discuss and agree on a fixed set of changes. There's no explicit set of rules to decide on changes going forward at this point, though that's true of Core too.

The movie industry would not exist at all without IP laws. There would probably be a very limited amount of film produced as art, but it's doubtful if much in the way of related technologies would have been developed at all since there's zero profit incentive. I suppose public service TV channels could still air news programming and such.


The obvious example is the pharmaceutical industry where the formulas is public years before you hit the market. I will admit that in some industries it's not quite the same.


No, it won't. In the best case, you would get a short period of sales before your competitors can copy you, but for any sort of expensive research this won't be enough. In many situations they could just copy the technology before your product is even released and try to beat you to the stores.


No, they won't. They simply won't. They will copy your technology and save millions on research costs so that they can provide the same products cheaper.


Whatever you're using is not market theory and has no basis in reality. Why would competitive forces make someone shell out millions when they know everyone else will just copy the results.

UASF has almost zero support. If they just ignore it the people running it would receive almost no new blocks after August 1st and then switch back to another client soon after.
The fact that they're putting in extra effort to try to activate in time for UASF nodes not to get forked off just means they they want to be as inclusive as possible to get people on board with the changes. Pissing off UASF users needlessly doesn't help their goals.
It's still possible (and IMO likely) that some miner delays signalling by a week just to prove that the UASF doesn't work.

If you pick and choose the scale depending on the values, the chart becomes a meaningless abuse of statistics. You need to be able to argue in favor of a scale independent of the actual values. For appreciating assets you should pretty much always use a log scale, and you might also have to take inflation into account for the chart to be truly meaningful.
Bitcoin isn't really a true appreciating asset though, it's (supposedly) a currency. It might be true that at this point it mostly functions as an asset, but once it transforms into a currency your log scales will be a bit meaningless.

If you sell your own computer, you're almost certainly selling it for less money than you bought it for, so there's no capital gain to tax. This is the case for almost everything that you buy to use, as opposed to buying as an investment.

Firstly, that doesn't really counter my point, which was that if you choose a scale to make the chart look nice you're doing it wrong. You should be able to argue for your choice of scale without knowing the actual numbers.
Secondly, a log scale is far from always appropriate. For example, when expressing speed as a function of time a linear scale is almost always better. Percentage charts are also typically better presented in linear form.

In Sweden you would most definitely have to pay capital gains tax if you sell gold that you invested in with profit, just as you would if you sold a house, foreign currency, or pretty much anything else.
As far as I know this is the case in pretty much every country that has a capital gains tax at all. As I said in my last post, small amounts are typically exempt to decrease the bureaucracy, so if you sold a gold watch or some currency leftover from a trip, you wouldn't have to pay.

Handling of stolen goods may leave you liable to pay and in theory you could face criminal charges depending on the jurisdiction. This all depends on if you knew that the goods were stolen, or if you at least should have realized it.

The lack of two-way replay protection doesn't make it impossible to split the coins and sell one or both. In fact, the opt-in replay protection in Segwit2x makes it pretty easy to do so. Even with no replay protection at all it would be relatively easy to split coins after a week or so.


So far Segwit has only provided a ~5% block size increase. Even in 12 months it's unlikely to be more than a 20% increase which simply isn't enough at this stage.

Trading "properly" is not something you can simply learn from a reddit comment thread. The kind of day trading you are trying to do is effectively a zero-sum game, if someone wins someone else has to lose. In order to gain money you have to beat the other traders, many which have decades of experience and are probably smarter than you. Bad traders tend to be weeded out pretty quickly.
At this point it's clear that you are not skilled enough to profit from day trading. IF you do believe in bitcoins it's reasonable to invest 5-10% of your total assets in it, but as a long-term investment. More than that is very risky to invest in a single asset, even if the asset seems promising.
From everything you have written in these comments, it's clear that you ARE a gambler. You might not always have been one, but you are one now. Let's look at some symptoms:
* You are lying to your relatives about how much money you have lost.
* You are gambling with money that aren't really yours (but you are still justifying this in your mind).
* You blame your losses on bad luck and think that you deserved to win rather than lose.
* You are desperate to win your money back and you think this is a reasonable goal, even though it seems more likely you will lose more money if you try.
All of these are textbook symptoms of a gambling addiction. I feel sorry for your sister. Please do not gamble away her remaining college tuition.
