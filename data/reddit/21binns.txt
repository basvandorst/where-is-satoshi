Hi, apologies, Arch Linux isn't officially supported yet. The current supported platforms are:
* Mac OSX
* Debian-based (e.g. Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu)
More platforms and distributions are on the way, like Windows (and also Arch), as well as mobile support for Android and iOS. If you'd like to be notified of releases, please send an email to support and we'll be happy to keep you in the loop.
Also, if you'd like to get involved and be a part of what's being built, [here's a direct link to the GitHub repo]( - all are welcome to contribute.
