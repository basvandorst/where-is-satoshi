Other than making fun of gullible fools like you of course. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:09:08
Yes. It's all documented. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:46:54
Also over your head if you think this is some kind of proof that in 5 years from now there will be guaranteed profits. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:40:22
You have no idea if the price was supposed to be here. You just pulled that out of your ass. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:28:13
Ah so now you're blaming the government for him wanting to kill people. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:53:02
Shh, the story only goes to this point. After that it gets uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:57:05
Yeah, huge problem for the price. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:48:34
Man, this seriously has been asked so many times. There are at least 200 topics that will answer your question. Just do a search. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:00:27
Ah shit. Too late. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:25:35
But apparently you know for certain that he will be doing well in 5 years from now if he invests in Bitcoin. 
So why don't you explain to us how you know this?
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:32:54
Bullshit. You just deny it because he is your hero. It's that simple. And hypocrite. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:37:58
It's mainly to make fun of paranoid cultists like you. Do you really not see that people like you are exactly the reason exists? They don't hate Bitcoin. They hate the cult. 
I'm a Bitcoiner and even i hate the cult. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:43:17
I remember when i was 18 and thought i knew it all. 
I was wrong. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:09:12
Sure. Because a Bitcoiner would never act this way, right?
And all the people who upvoted this to the mainpage are Buttcoiners as well. It's all one big conspiracy to make the Bitcoin community look stupid. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:48:12
No. They haven't been sold. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:50:24
Or you know they just try to make some quick profit now and don't give a crap what will happen in 3 years. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:38:29
Yes there is such a charge and will go on trial for that in Maryland. You idiot. Hilarious how you are telling me to get facts straight. God, you look stupid right now. I almost feel sorry for you. 
And even the updated charge.
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:01:04
As a Bitcoin owner i obviously want it to succeed but an argument like yours is not convincing. It's nothing more than "it will go up again because i say so". 
@_date: 2015-01-09 08:22:13
So yet once again the media makes fun of Bitcoin and it's one big circle jerk here how this is the best thing to happen so far this year?
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:23:10
Could it be it adjusted since then? What do you think? Could it?
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:21:55
I don't. And that's exactly why we keep going down. You must be looking at a different chart. 
And i didn't misspell anything. I'm Han. Some hunk. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:06:08
Amazing logic. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:19:01
Stop being so surprised that they have security checks. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:03:25
Traders. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:39:30
Because hardly anybody uses it. There are more mined coins every day than people who want to buy. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:06:45
Oh fuck off. 
I even got downvoted in a post where we were asked if you think the price will go down or up. 
I just answered the guys question and said down and got downvoted to hell. 
This place is completely retarded when it comes to downvoting. 
And the best part is we have to read 5 threads a day about trolls and shills and what not who supposedly are downvoting shit all day long. 
No, they aren't the problem. Bitcoiners who can't handle any criticism whatsoever are. 
Edit: hilarious how this post got the first downvote in seconds. The irony will be thick in this one. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:36:40
Take your meds. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:39:54
Right. Normally you never react this way. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:48:26
Yes we know. We really do. The 10 posts before you might be the reason why. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:11:18
Lose. Not loose. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:27:06
And ignore we've been going down 12 months straight with no sign of stopping. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:01:55
Just like the dozens of other threads asking the Reddit community to get together and do something this will fail as well. When will you people learn. 
This place is full of 15-25 year old broke and paranoid drug users who own a fraction of a coin in hopes to get rich. This isn't some kind of awesome community that stands up for each other and gets together to fight the evil out there in the name of Bitcoin. Most of them would sell their mother for half a coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:41:25
Without reading the article i assume they're talking about the dollar?
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:35:10
This gentlemen thing is getting cringey. Especially since from the 200 times it's used for something 199 times it meant absolutely nothing. Just like this situation. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:46:27
Can't you see 10 people before you already posted this? Do you people ever learn?
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:23:00
How do you know the bull market will return?
Edit: the downvoting in this sub is insane. All it does is show that you are an insecure little bitch. 
Just be a man and try to answer my question instead of trying to downvote anything you don't like. Grow up. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:46:37
Which they refuse to for some reason. 
Downvoted because i'm wrong or what? Please enlighten me.

Yes. Soon it will be curing aids.

Wow amazing! Sending you my money now!
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:31:56
2 weeks?
Only a total idiot would deal with those scumbags again. (Or buy mining rigs in general)
Which means they'll have shitloads of customers again soon. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:38:33
Test what?
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:31:36
How the hell is anyone supposed to know? How many time travelers do you see here?
It truly amazes me that 5 people a day ask this same question. What goes on in your head exactly when you make a post like this?
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:49:05
Because 1 troy ounce equals one Bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:45:56
Bitcoin was not hacked. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:17:58
No, because obviously they need to go to court first. 
And if he will be found guilty you and the other fanboys will call it a conspiracy. I know how it works. 
You love drugs and Bitcoin so he just has to be innocent. No other option possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:36:30
You are begging for money?
Jesus Christ. Calm down with the downvotes you idiots. Below he admitted it first looked like he was asking for tips. He made a mistake and i made a mistake in turn. 
The downvoting in this sub is just insane. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:08:33
Because it's a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:09:09
Buttcoiner? Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:22:36
Only if you're a drug using paranoid Bitcoiner. But for the rest of the world it doesn't. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:33:36
The fucking judge could post here with all the papers and he will still deny it. It's pathetic as hell. 
Edit: he's gone. I've seen this behavior over and over from people like him in these Ross threads. 
They just keep yelling how these charges are dropped and when proven wrong they dissapear. Only to do exactly the same thing in the next thread about Ross. 
Amazing how people can live like that. 
And let's of course not forget how this all starts. 
"I love drugs and Bitcoin and hate the government, Ross ran a marketplace for drugs and accepted Bitcoin and hates the government, he is my hero so he has to be innocent". 
This is literally the way these people think. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:06:05
Can you point out the trolls in the Wiki for me please?
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:42:59
I'm from Slovenia so my English isn't perfect. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:11:45
How can you guarantee it exactly? What proof do you have?
Downvoted for asking proof of an (absurd) claim. 
Where else than If i would claim we're guaranteed going down without proof i would be downvoted to oblivion. But claim something everyone wants to hear and it rains upvotes. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:04:02
Amazing logic. 
No, not really. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:34:24
"Could have"
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:13:24
It's sickening how this community just keeps defending criminals. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:01:30
No. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:58:06
That's why it's complete bs. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:30:45
Thanks but i don't accept tips. 
I'm seriously getting downvoted for this? What is wrong with this place?
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:22:35
I haven't checked his dropbox but it's either a trojan or he is really dumb. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:52:13
Because we know the address the coins are sitting in. As mentioned in about every post about the hack. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:00:13
5 times a day. Every single day. The same question. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:45:18
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:21:25
They want others to buy. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:29:18
Let me guess. You have this all the time?
Maybe it's because you're an asshole. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:32:27
How old should my account be before i was allowed to type that to you?
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:58:22
I'm aware certain posts will attract downvotes but that's why i gave a specific example. The downvoting here is insane. If you get downvoted because you think the price goes down in a thread that asks for your opinion then there is something seriously wrong. 
You even have people who go through your post history to downvote just because they don't like one of your posts. 
There is also something seriously wrong with your life if you do such things. 
Personally i never touch the downvote system. I think it's worthless and i don't feel like censoring people i don't agree with. Only insecure dumbasses do such things. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:48:40
Yes he is. Can you people just stop lying in every Ross thread?
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:29:55
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:53:10
I realize that. And that doesn't apply to Bitcoin. So i'm curious to know what he possibly wants to test. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:24:40
It's looking more bad by the day. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:27:36
Do a chargeback or call your bank. 
Oh wait. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:25:02
So far the only person here who seems to get his advice through astrology is you. I prefer proof when someone makes a claim. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:23:56
Only a fool would still deal with these mining companies. 
1: you won't make money. 
2: chances being scammed are extremely high. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:58:44
Trying to get rich quick through something that looks too good to be true. 
I just can't feel sorry for these people. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:59:06
Some charges were dropped. Correct. The Maryland charge wasn't. And you will realize what a fucking idiot you are when that one starts. But you won't admit it. No. You will pull some more shit out of your ass why your druggie hero is innocent. 
Since this seems to be the holy grail for Ross news for you idiots let me use this link. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:49:05
So they go to the media first while letting tons of people with their money locked up wait? Nothing on their site or Twitter. On Reddit. On the forum. 
Bad business. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:38:59
Every move and payment regarding that is documented. 
I'm pretty sure they have a very strong case against him when it comes to the hitman thing. I realize you fanboys will keep denying this because it doesn't fit your Ross is innocent mantra but at one point even you people will have to face reality. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:25:14
How many more years are you gonna keep saying this?
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:49:08
There is no common sense possible with you druggies. 
"He was never charged with murder for hire!!!!"
Well here are the official papers which prove you wrong. 
"Faaaaaaake!!!1! Conspiracy!! Corrupt government!!"
See what i mean. You people live a very sad life in a fucked up fantasy world. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:02:40
A mining scam. No way??
@_date: 2015-01-11 11:29:19
This is bullish. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:45:49
Posts like this shows how desperate Bitcoiners are getting. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:13:28
Been going down for a year. So i see no reason why it would go up now. Did anything change? No? Then i'd say down is where we go. 
Edit: downvoted to hell for posting my opinion about the price in a thread where i'm asked about my opinion about the price. 
Well done Well done. 
Let me get this right. I'm allowed to post my opinion if it's something everybody wants hear? This place is ridiculous. And at the same time i have to read thread after thread about buttcoiners and so called paid shills who supposedly downvote everything. 
Take a look in the goddamn mirror!
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:30:04
Yeah. I'm sure that's the one and only reason. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:23:13
Dude, just buy some. Just 1 hour of real work will get you more bitcoin than earning them online in a month. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:46:36
I prefer not to support criminals. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:50:39
Affect. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:12:40
Let me check my crystal ball.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:45:22
Because every time there is some big news 20 people will post the same thing. I can understand this happens if it's your first week on the internet. After that it's just retarded. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:05:53
Or someone hacked an exchange - occam's razor. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:24:55
God, your edit is just beyond pathetic. Please point out just one paid shill anywhere in this sub. Doesn't even need to be in this thread. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:10:19
Wtf are you talking about? He asked what's your opinion. Will we go up or down. I said down and got downvoted to hell for it. An opinion is not allowed here unless it's positive for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:06:26
It's hilarious how all the downvotes in this thread prove my point instantly. But i guess you need an IQ above 70 to understand that. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:12:46
No he wasn't. Stop making things up just because he is your druggie hero. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:35:22
Really? Why don't you tell us what exactly happens in 5 years from now?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:44:35
Please back up your claim with proof. I mean you didn't just pull this put of your ass, right?
@_date: 2015-01-07 12:53:46
ZOOOOOMMMGGG!!!1! Such breaking news!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:42:03
I got downvoted the other day for not accepting a tip. Apparently that is not allowed. 
Edit: and now downvoted for mentioning it. Also not allowed. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:51:28
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:10:36
And let's just ignore he tried to have several people killed. If he gets convicted for that you will call it a conspiracy. That's how hypocrites like you roll. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:23:25
How old should my account be before i'm allowed to type the above sentence exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:52:00
180k what?
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:20:28
It's probably the hacker splitting up his 5 million. Hehehe. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:05:41
Everything in the Bitcoin economy is in decline. They most likely simply have way less business than before. 
I expect a lot of companies to close during 2015. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:18:06
The lower the price goes the more desperate these kind of posts get. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:39:42
My bad. Sorry. 
Edit: you now added a part to your post. It did look like you wanted tips before. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:05:07
Can you people stop using that word please?
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:04:17
How old are you?
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:53:45
Really? Tell us more. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:22:06
ZOOOMMMG THAT IS SO WORTHY OF ALL CAPS!!1
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:14:38
No. They only seem fair to you if you can make your point. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:37:36
Fuck me, you druggies have a fucked up view of the world. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:28:56
Yeah well, trying to have several people killed is also wrong. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:45:15
We're in an extremely deep bear market. But i'll take some of whatever you are smoking. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 13:05:31
What part is wrong or made by Buttcoiners exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:50:50
What exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:00:55
Looks like a paid article. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:35:27
You totally missed his point. Or actually most likely on purpose. You hate this just happened. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:48:34
Could of is not English. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:10:10
How do you know?
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:18:47
(Isn't there a rumour of it going up to a few thousand $ per bitcoin in a few years?)
No, don't fall for that shit. NOBODY on this entire planet knows where Bitcoin will be 3 years from. Anybody who tells you otherwise is lying. 
The main reason people say this is because they need new people to invest in Bitcoin to make the price go up. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:30:30
Haha. No, not really. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:35:39
I have to be suspicious that you are completely paranoid and delusional. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:47:15
Idiot. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:08:41
You're getting downvoted just like the first people who reported problems with Stamp. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:38:35
Exactly nothing. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:41:39
People who fall for this scam 101 deserve to lose their money. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:25:31
Wtf are you talking about. They posted as soon as Stamp was back online. You simply thought you were the first to post about it. Just like the 10 people before you. How much longer do you need before you realize you should check before posting?
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:16:36
Just like the 50 people before you called something the killer app. 
Use some common sense man. This won't be the killer app. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:38:03
Dude, nobody on this planet knows where the price will go. Unless you hold 10k coins you are gonna market dump. And if that's the case they surely won't tell you here on Reddit.
