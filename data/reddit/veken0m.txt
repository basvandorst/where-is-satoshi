Here are some shots of the notification and the alarm configuration menu:

Thanks. It's not open source yet but I'm planning to do so before I start classes again.

Thank you very much for your feedback. I have plans to expand the graphing options unfortunately the graphing library I am using for Bitcoinium is fairly limited (no zoom, etc). For the time being you can view Buying/Selling orders by selecting "OrderBook" from the main menu to get an idea of market depth.
On another note, I have noticed that Bitcoin Widget is unable to refresh the MtGox widget on 3G (might only be some devices/carriers). If you use 3G often and suffer from this issue you might like to know that this is not a problem in Bitcoinium as I have implemented a workaround.

I'm sorry it looks that way. I was testing out satoshidice with funds I sent to the wallet to see if everything worked correctly. As you can see, I haven't really been getting many Bitcoin donations (got a nice one recently, thanks!) because users still seem to prefer supporting the app by using Google Wallet. Which is a shame because Google bites off a good chunk.

Thanks for the update! I will have some extra time once exams are over so I might be able to help with XChange development.
@_date: 2012-12-02 19:06:39
Thanks! 
Bitcoinium is currently using the XChange Library to obtain data from exchanges ( As this library supports more exchanges so will Bitcoinium. If I remember correctly someone is working on adding Intersango.
I would love to support all mining pools but they all have different APIs so they need to be addressed on a case by case basis. If you have specific pools you would to be included in Bitcoinium please email me (veken0m.apps and I will look into it.

Sounds awesome, I'm in.

Whoa... I wasn't aware of this exchange! Been using VirtEx since it started and the fee increase has been killing me. Just set up an account at Libertybit and hoping to trade there once liquidity increases. Will definitely add them to my android app, Bitcoinium, once they have an API. Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:04:53
Great stuff. XChange is used in my android app [Bitcoinium]( It’s really nice to write code once and have it seamlessly work across a bunch of exchanges! Good job guys!

Hi captaincrunchhn,
I'd like to add support for your exchange to [XChange]( java library and my Android app [Bitcoinium](
At first glace it seems I will need to be verified in order to obtain an API key. Would it be possible to make an exception? Would it also be possible for you to make the marketdata API not required a key? (ie: ticker, orderbook and trades)
Looking forward to using Vault of Satoshi :)
Feel free to PM me for any additional information. Thanks!
PS: If you are interesting in advertising your exchange you can do so through our new service, [KarmaAds](

Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:43:51
Awesome! My order is in the screenshot :)
@_date: 2013-03-13 01:48:50
Hmm, good point. Hadn't noticed time was set to US locale. I'll fix it in the next update!

Hi I am the developer of open-sourced android app Bitcoinium and was wondering if you would be interested in contributing to existing open source projects rather than starting from scratch. 
Bitcoinium supports 8 exchanges, 7 mining pools, BitcoinCharts, BitcoinAverage data and growing constantly. Exchange data is obtained via XChange, an open sourced library that creates a consistent interface with Bitcoin exchange APIs. I've made a lot of contributions to XChange.
In order to help the Bitcoin community grow, Bitcoinium has ditched Google Ads and now uses Karma-Ads which displays only Bitcoin-related advertisments.
We have major plans coming up *cough* in-app trading *cough* and would really appreciate the help :). Contact me if you are interested! Thanks!

If you can't see the widgets try rebooting your device. A couple users have reported that they can only see the widgets after a reboot.

Price was actually very decent, intl. shipping kinda killed it though. Although, BTC price dropped 25% since so it came out MUCH cheaper than Amazon in the end :)
