Charlemagne conquered much of Europe and enslaved everyone who survived to work in his silver mines.  But he wasn't interested in the silver, he just used it to trade for gold.

That's not what Gresham's law is.
Gresham's law deals with two monies made by the same issuer with the same fiat value but differing commodity values.
Edit: Hoarding is caused by scarcity.

Have you looked into the distribution of precious metals?  In 1889 Del Mar claimed that at least 50% of all precious metals were obtained through slavery.  Since then a lot has happened, but the more I learn about the history of precious metals, the more I learn that bitcoin's distribution isn't much of an issue at all.

That's also a history of conquest and slavery. In 1890 Del Mar stated that about one half of precious metals were acquired through conquest and slavery.
All this conquest and slavery made precious metal mining unprofitable for the non slave owning miners, as it led to inflation, lowering the value (scarcity) of the precious metals.
So nowadays, if we buy precious metals, are we not increasing their demand, thus increasing their scarcity, and thus making this past plunder even more profitable?

I am currently reading [The Lost Science Of Money]( by Zarlenga.  I think it might be the opposite of Rothbard, but I have not yet read Rothbard.  
I am finding this book incredibly interesting, though I think his conclusion is going to be that government issued fiat is the way to go (as opposed to current bank issued fiat). 
Of course "The Lost Science" part of the name is added to [Alexander Del Mar]( [Science of Money]( from 1885.  A lot of Zarlenga's work seems to be updates of Del Mar's work.  
I had wanted to read something like Rothbard next, but I am so wrapped up in this Lost Science book and reading up on background material with the Greeks, Romans, and Carthaginians it is really making me want to read Del Mar's [History of Precious Metals](
What I have gathered so far from Zarlenga is that he feels Rothbard got the history of gold becoming money wrong.  Zerlenga claims gold only become money by fiat, fixing the price of a cow at 130 grains of gold.

He was right to be nervous, just look at what they did to Bernard von NotHaus in may of 2009.  I am sure Satoshi was paying attention to that story.
