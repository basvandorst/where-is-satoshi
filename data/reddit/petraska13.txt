I predict bitcoin to reach $50m by August 18 too.
and I also predict that governments will only allow conversion from fiat to crypto and not the other way round.

as expected incumbents in the financial industry will have their own blockchain

whats a crypto pro?
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:20:58
i had btc since 2009, still not seeing adoption
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:27:32
the difference here is that everything in the chart generates revenue/sales

Tim could potentially go down as the biggest clown in history or a genius!

everyone will just be rich then, the bangladeshi kids will be worth easily $100m.
I predict McD's increasing price of cheeseburger to $100k a pop
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:28:01
adjusting for the manipulation, btc should only be worth c.4k
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:21:58
lol bought it instantaneously, no KYC!
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:38:20
so who's adopting it?
so long as there is upside potential on pricing, adoption remains a dream

Someone get this nutter outta here :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:07:42
awesome, i guess my model aligns pretty nicely with yours, I'm getting a price of $5117
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:23:21
Great we’re all in agreement, therefore we must be right! Let’s throw a party!

Absolutely chinese too, thinking about the miners and major exchange operator.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:17:37
then why push so hard for it to be accepted as payment for transactions?

low interest rates environment has driven up asset prices over the last decade and we're now starting to see global rates rising, cheap dumb money won't come easy anymore and if a global recession sets in thanks to the ongoing trade war...cryptos wont be spared, a lot of my money in cryptos were made from traditional asset classes on the back of cheap financing. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 06:10:54
that's not the solution, when central banks step in, what do you propose they do? borrow elsewhere to repay? print more money? whichever decision they make, the pressure will be felt across all asset classes, traditional and new...no investments will be immuned
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:29:59
lets hope thats the case. not saying everyone trading with leverage but a lot of funds poured into cryptos over the years were the result of cheap capital and outperformances in traditional asset classes, e.g. property, stocks, etc. - these funds there pour into the crypto space. in a downturn scenario, you will not see such healthy inflows into cryptos.
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:27:53
crypto will crash and burn too if the bond market crashes
@_date: 2018-07-18 23:27:05
in economic downturns, all asset classes become strongly correlated. think there are many empirical research that proves this out there.
