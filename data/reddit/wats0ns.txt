So were you able to get your money back ?
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:10:47
Hope so :D
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:42:42
Well maybe in the future, my current phone is actually most powerful than the computers on the market at the beginning of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:12:41
However, you'll have to provide them your wallet.dat file, but they have a good reputation in the bitcoin community
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:27:54
Well I'm willing to try, but be careful with people you pick, or you will get scammed, the wallet.dat contains your private key, giving access to your bitcoins. Have you tried wallet recovery services ?

Yep, Willy bot would have dreamed of something like this !
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:58:08
Ho man, this is gonna be sad, but no, you can't
@_date: 2015-12-11 09:55:43
Try LocalBitcoins
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:09:19
Yeah, but the block  confirmed before block  ...
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:01:19
Thanks, wasn't sure :D
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:54:30
Sounds like they sent 0.972btc to 1BmVpg9MiCpiFNsJEzQQzayahiDHU25jC. This address made a total of ~~7,831~~ *7795 according to the bot below* transactions, probably a mixing service. However, the rest of the ransom, 2.07, is still on 144TFe6ZjgdzZ9QLihzLXUFNE4TBwiQQKR. You should watch this address carefully (use  Hope that helps !

Basically, NMC and BTC are using the same mining algorithms. Eligius then send you works resolving Bitcoin AND Namecoin Proof-Of-Work

Private Internet Access
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:11:13
The thing is, Bitcoin nodes bans "malicious IP". This is an anti-DDOS measure, as it avoids them being overloaded by false-transactions (badly signed transactions, transactions with false inputs, bad blocs, ...). 
If all the Bitcoin nodes used TOR (or just a majority), an attacker could spam non-TOR bitcoin nodes from the TOR network with invalid transactions, which will result in a massive ban of TOR exit nodes from the bitcoin nodes. This is very dangerous to Bitcoin as this will result in a huge decrease in the number of Bitcoin nodes
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:42:41
You should make it public ;-)
@_date: 2015-06-19 09:38:18
Cool, so maybe they'll stop scamming on LBC
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:28:37
Why's that ?
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:09:12
I knew it !
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:26:58
If I remember well, they're using an algorithm based on the fees, network propagation, etc, that determines the probability a transaction will be double spent. This allow them to accept 0-conf transactions without to much risks, and require 2-3 confirmations in case of high risks transactions
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:48:18
Well, this allows an attacker to disconnect from the bitcoin network every single node behind the TOR network. If a majority of the nodes are behind the TOR network, you can cause great damages to bitcoin security...
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:09:37
I personnaly blocked this with the privacy manager (Cyanogen Mod), but yeah, I don't like that...
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:03:45
Nice work ! send $0.5 !
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:21:58
Would like to know too, if they do I'll setup a node ASAP
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:37:11
DPR didn't have a very good opsec, the fall of SR1 is not due to Iceland laws IMHO
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:02:25
Sites like cashali could be a great option too, but the transfer would take longer to process 
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:37:15
And where did you get the bootstrap.dat ? I can't find recent torrents of the Blockchain :/
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:45:08
Trade for Nubits 
@_date: 2015-12-31 10:44:20
How did you get Willy bot source code ? :D
@_date: 2015-06-08 06:30:21
Copay doesn't support Hardware Wallets...
@_date: 2015-06-20 08:59:20
They got a BTM tough : 
@_date: 2015-12-29 10:38:56
Changetip, you can get 10-15$ with your credit card, no questions asked
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:09:57
Perfectly agree, I'm done with Multibit too
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:58:41
Yes it is :D A port is like a mailbox in the building that is your router. To open it you have to go in your router's interface and configure it
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:44:10
Are you charging fees (or wilio API) for the SMS or is it free ?
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:03:10
You should try to do something like the Bitcoin Rain !
@_date: 2015-06-12 07:00:26
Thanks for the constructive answer ...
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:30:28
Nice, have a SMS on me ! sms
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:14:21
Yeah, but with 50.000$ they could block the network for a pretty long time, and this is not such a huge amount of money...
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:11:06
Wait, what is their business model exactly ???
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:23:42
@_date: 2015-12-28 13:05:34
The most plausible explanation is the arrival of Bitfury's new chips on the market, they are way faster than the others for the consumption of elictricity 
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:47:30
Yeah, but it's fully decentralized, so I guess that's the closest we have of a "Bitcoin-like" forum
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:50:28
Something like 0.5-1 BTC in VPN and Amazon (trough shapeshift.io)
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:24:14
So let's pray for pruned nodes ! :D
@_date: 2015-12-13 23:11:29
Nope (AFAIK), bitcoin Core used a Upnp library which contained a buffer overflow vulnerability (only locally exploitable), this has been corrected like 1-2 month ago
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:00:43
I think it's both, you can enable a new world of possibility with the cryptowonders of Bitcoin !
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:48:29
Hi, I got the exact same problem here in France with 100€ orders, I got 3 peoples last week wanting to buy BTC (+1 in mycelium local Trader), but they never answered to my messages ...
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:46:55
AFAIK, electrum's main developer recently refused to add a join market plugin because he wanted to avoid its wallet be considered as "money laundering software".
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:39:00
I think Bitpay and Coinbase have a "Double spend protection", don't they ?
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:45:28
What if skynet was just a sci-fi character and time-travel impossible ?
@_date: 2015-06-11 08:55:15
That's great, I hope the others pools will dothe samt hings ...

Probably HD earthporn from the Geographic channel
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:53:29
Fell like  is the best solution so far
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:21:45
Think it's for AML/KYC compliances : requires just a phone number under 800$, then requires ID verification for amounts up to 3000$
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:02:58
UPnP ?
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:26:39
Thank you for your answers, so I simply stripped the GUI of Electrum, and it works just fine ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:41:06
We need to take a look at Ehtereum, smart block-size adjustment is one of its main innovations
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:01:26
Yes but fees are actually abut 0.01$, so a large attacker can make as much transactions as he wants if he has a huge amout of money (think about the enemies of Bitcoin, they have money)
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:22:18
And what do you think about Nubits ? The rates are more close from the market rates : 1BTC= 236Nubits= 236$, this sounds good, it's less than a 1% fee !
@_date: 2015-05-09 08:31:39
Yeah, This shows really explain the problem ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:46:34
Looks awesome !
@_date: 2015-05-02 12:39:53
Yeah, but I'm not such a fan of Java, and they are missing some important features that Electrum and Multbit spent time to develop ...
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:41:45
Well thanks, I've never hear of this site before, I'm thinking about buying a node now ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-15 13:29:32
You can pick a fée between 0.5% and 3% ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:01:00
someone just sent $0.01 to this adress :D
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:25:58
Good, this is what will bring Bitcoin to mainstream ;-)

Do you face a lots of fraud-related problems with your BTM ?
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:15:56
SO cuuute &lt;3 :D
@_date: 2015-05-01 13:18:10
Yeah, and according to them 1BTC = 235$, so 1BTC= 235/1.07= 219$, so that's still a 12% fee ....
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:30:28
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:04:11
Yeah but my Bitcoins will be on their site, so not on my computer, right ?
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:14:48
I personally use bitmixer.io with instant transaction when I need privacy, and I use more options (bigger delays, several addresses,...) when I need to be fully anonymous
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:01:56
Maybe add samouraï wallet ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:01:32
Received one too
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:27:17
Some core devs considers the classic hard fork as a take-over by some hostile miners, and a change of the POW algo is actually the last defense against this attack (not saying anything against/for classic fork, just explaining)
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:58:58
Oh that's even more awesome !
@_date: 2016-01-09 12:53:47
Yeah, that's the exchange I'm using ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-09 10:42:07
Had no problems with them, they just ask me to take a picture of a signed confirmation because my exchange is in a foreign country
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:53:21
Plutus fees are around 3-4%, this could repel some peoples...
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:02:58
And frenchs, I'm doing really okay with my internet connections here ;-)
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:31:44
Do you have a link about this story ? Never heard of this thing before...
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:21:16
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:08:35
Totally agree with you, unhappily high speed Internet is not always a reality in the countries using Bitcoin a lot (China, US, Argentina,...)
@_date: 2015-08-28 09:06:14
You are being scammed :D
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:25:45
I've emailed them 2 months ago, still no answer... Think the project is dead, sadly ...
@_date: 2015-08-30 17:16:58

@_date: 2015-07-01 20:48:54
That's a good news, but they still have a premium of 10-15% ...

@_date: 2015-09-24 21:28:25
Nobody denies the fact that they help "bringing bitcoin to the masses", the only problem is that nobody wants to see a company "owning" the "technos of Bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:31:28
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it be more useful to upgrade you mem pool capacity (disk/RAM space, dunno where it's stocked )
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:39:22
Invite sent, waiting for the answer 😋
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:51:22
Blockchain.info is blockchain.info, they are known to be unable to work during Bitcoin Stress Test
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:46:16
Careful here, Shapeshift is one of the main investor of a multi blockchain forensic tool
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:32:20
It's a raspberry PI with a mining chip on it, there is no such thing as "optimized for Bitcoin", you can buy a raspberry kit for 40$ and buy Bitcoins with the 360$ you saved from buying 21inc computer, will be more profitable...
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:25:37
Oh that's weird, no comments of buttcoiners on this sub ...
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:30:14
Who knows ? That's the beauty of Bitcoin (Ether has nothing to do with Bitcoin blockchain btw, so probably contracts or someting else...)
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:57:42
Yep, cause you set a normal fee, but the point of this stress test is to show what happens when mem pool is huge and when blocks are nearly fulls
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:47:14
They still got a mixing service ? Thought it was over ...
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:21:03
