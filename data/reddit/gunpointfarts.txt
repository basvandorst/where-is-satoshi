I too never give advice, but my one piece would be, buy btc! 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:55:11
Inferior coin for crap coffee! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:01:13
I bought more, does that count? 
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:23:54
No, but I want to believe! Lol
@_date: 2019-07-28 06:02:06
Curiosity and a naive hope it would have been legit.
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:24:15
Another 5k and he will be a free man and I will be richer than ever.
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:02:17
It takes me to coinbase. I don’t have a coinbase account. I use the cash app.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:17:57
I bought more at just below 15k. Couple hours later it hit 13.2k and thought, shit I need to buy more! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:43:47
Where’s my lambo? I was told there would be lambos?

I got $15 on a $50 transfer this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:08:43
What the fuck is with you miserable people? Im simply stating how much my fee was. Go be a prick somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:00:55
Noob here! With this statement being said, why does it take so long for me to buy btc using my bank? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:48:58
Have you invested in Dank Memes yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:28:20
[Water4]( It’s a charity heavily supported by Bellator fighter and reddit user Justin Wren aka u/TheBigPygmy. They set up water wells properly for those who have no clean water for miles in the Congo. This guy has caught malaria more than once. It’s a charity I really believe is doing good for the less fortunate.

I need some help. I just got a text message saying “coinbase external account sent you 12btc” and a link to something. I haven’t opened it, I feel like I’m being scammed. Is there a way I can protect myself before opening it? I’m so curious.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:48:26
Says the guy who “started investing a week ago” 19 days ago. Go bark at a tree, big dog. I’m sure you’ll find ur nut up there. If you can’t be a decent human being don’t talk to me. 
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:53:15
I’m not very savy, is there a way you may know I can protect myself after I open it just in case?
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:29:32
Anytime Justin!
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:18
I’m not entirely sure, but this can’t happen forever. That’s crazy fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:55:51
This coming from a dumbfuck as myself, feel like it’s a bit confusing to people you want to convince to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:42
Found this posted here yesterday and ive used it about 5 times already. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:08:33
I must know more about this, “twat” you speak of. Google finds me very graphic images of labia, why so? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:55:19
If I just uninstall the app will it stop the transaction? 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:01:34
Wait so me buying $30 just now is hurting bitcoin? I feel like Ive done something wrong. It's taking forever for them to complete transaction. All I wanted to do was place a bet. :(
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:02:43
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:02:31
Yeah I get it, I m stupid. All I'm getting is people laughing at me. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:23:23
I guess, I don't get how this is going to catch on. I had to do hours of research and still not sure I understand it. So many fees from every way and from what I've found out, not a lot of merchants that benefit my needs accept it. And the fact I put money in today, tomorrow it could be less? Yeah, I'm not the smartest dude by any means. But using something that fluctuates like the stock market doesn't make sense as a currency.

Did you blow him or what?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:17:12
What’s up with the hole in the hammock and feces on his face?

As the customers are eating the pizza do you come by minute to minute and take or add slices as they eat depending on the dip or run at the time?
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:45:48
I just dumped my degen gambling winnings into my wallet. Only around $300 but it’s something. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:56:06
I'm not entirely sure what's going on with btc, but I bought more today after I got paid. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:23:17
Probably the only person that's okay with the decision that went down that night. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:32:29
As a small time holder, this is all just really fascinating. We are all apart of a revolution of sorts.

Well shit, lets ride this bitch till the wheels fall off.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:13:10
Have any of you seen this bot? 
Isn’t bcash bullshit coin? 
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:53:42
How low do you think this dip will go? I keep buying the dip but then it goes lower and I’m thinking fuck I could have gotten more out of this dip.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:11:54
This man likes South American prostitutes to shit in his mouth and face through a hammock. I don’t care what he says, I’ll follow his every word. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:23:34
Good luck with that. Please keep is updated if you get it back.
