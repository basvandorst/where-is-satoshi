You do realise that the so called 2 month burn-in test at manufacturer's facility is actually mining for their own pool until finally they sell them, don't you? Meanwhile they develop a more profitable model and the cycle repeats. Buyers basically get used miners.

Plus also physical seizure of coins upon arrest, if they manage to get physical access to the wallets

How would Satoshi dump any of those coins (not to mention all of them) without revealing their identity to exchanges or banks?
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:20:18
LoL. No they aren't moving
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:32:44
Ira going to dump the coins that she's going to receive from CW? You mean those imaginary coins?
EDIT: Fixed Ira's name
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:34:44
Just wait for the next reward halve
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:38:47
Why everyone keeps on implying that either one of them would even consider dumping them? I just can't follow the logic, especially considering that the value can skyrocket over prolonged period of time...

Donations going to an unspendable wallet (even with the key)

LoL. Wannabe Satoshis fighting over Bitcoin that none of them have ;)
The greed of mankind is astonishing
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:29:19
The coins that I bought in 2012 are still way up for me :)
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:37:00
Haha... CW is fecked either way, considering that now he must pay out over half million BTC to Klein :D
@_date: 2019-08-30 11:27:07
In what universe  will this nonsense even make sense, considering that safety and reliability all boil down to the opposite: wide distribution of nodes for consensus? The more the better. The more widespread the better. Sending something to be hosted on orbit only makes sense for centralized systems
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:29:05
That's the most idiotic theory of them all :D
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:13:49
I know that :)
However, nobody has actually provided any proof on whether Kleiman/Wright together (or even separately) had those 1.1M BTC to begin with. Maybe CW's delusions are contagious? :)
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:29:45
Maybe the real Satoshi will eventually show himself when he/she/they get enough of this shit show?
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:23:38
I don't give a flying feck about it.
Yours sincerely, 
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:45:51
What money? Oh, you mean these coins that never were?
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:42:46
This is a joke, right?
The site's url in the article doesn't work. And when I removed the double www from the beginning of the url I took me to a site of a company that's growing and selling flowers
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:14:19
Obviously :) 
Imho none of them deserve them coins. I'm pretty sure the true Satoshi will sooner or later end this lunacy and consolidate coins or sign a message or smth
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:31:44
Told by someone who obviously has no idea what he's talking about.
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:36:17
So during these latest court hearings, why would he present wallets addresses that no more contain coins? (even if they did contain coins in the past, and especially considering that these addresses weren't even his?)
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:14:04
What's wrong with exchanges?
@_date: 2019-12-27 12:53:34
Were you born in the land of assholes?

What do you mean by "it's alive?"
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:05:00
There's a simple double and add rule.
    Loop through all bits in private key:
        1) double
        2) if current bit is 1 then add
        3) go to 1)
This is a simplified example of the algo, in reality for efficient operation you'd actually loop through double and (add or substract)

QC will be of little help for cracking ecdsa. It's as difficult as breaking sha256. However, integer factoring based encryption schemes, such as  RSA, will fall like dominoes.

You just have to wait it out. Took me over a week to do the full sync. I've got 360Mbit broadband and top spec PC (16 core cpu, 32GB ram, Samsung EVO 970pro M.2 disk doing up to 3GB/s io)  and it still took a lot of time. It got especially slow when it started catching up with transactions from 2017 on...
So yeah, grab a beer and just take it easy

Genesis block is technically unspendable, even with known key. So sending btc to that black hole in no way is showing gratitude.
