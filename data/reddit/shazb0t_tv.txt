Easiest way is to do it on an exchange.

Just be aware that the default segwit implementation for electrum may not work with some exchanges, ie. GDAX.

Is this what shills look like now?

The upgrade to their site really worked out. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:43:32
Seems reasonable.. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:08:36
You're just wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:01:04
I'm getting mixed responses.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:30:58
Awesome, sounds right.

Can you send bitcoin from Coinbase/GDAX to a segwit wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:21:13
Is it legacy or segwit?  My understanding is that you can't send bitcoin from coinbase to a segwit Electrum wallet.

if Bitcoin development is so awful, how come Roger Ver's dev "team" chose to fork Bitcoin making it the basis of nearly all their code?

Possible pump action. Nobody here really knows.

I'll tell you what I wouldn't do. Throw a fit with a new username on reddit with no proof. If what you're saying happened I hope they make it right by you. Keep contacting their support. Make sure it wasn't the fault of your bank. Don't threaten a class action until you have all the facts on the table and they still clearly won't help you.

You haven't given us enough information or any kind of verifiable proof. You sound like a clown until you do those things.

-26 karma all from FUD.  Get a life.

I don't think you understand what ponzi or pyramid schemes even are.  Do some research.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:09:19
It's said "dead cat bounce", and no.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:52:50
You're a clown.
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:27:22
It already happened.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:01:13
Don't forget to put on your red nose. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:28:46
I just don't want to see his Youtube ads anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:10:29
Hahaha, great one!
