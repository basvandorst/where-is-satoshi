Tom Lee, that means it must be true.

Why does it matter?

It would not make a difference if Amazon.com gift card or not. Amazon.com ships internationally but not to every location (for example not to Switzerland).

Yes, not that funny, they came for the fiat.

People will see your personal IP if you run a full node allowing incoming connections (i.e. providing data to other nodes, providing the maximum benefit to the network). Only way to prevent that is to choose a VPN that allows port forwarding and assignes a unique address to you (but that is not the standard).
If you just wish to verify your own transactions independently from any block explorer, you could run a node without allowing incoming connections. For this you could use a VPN or use TOR (while I haven't personally looked into the TOR solution).

Another mistake: nach Belieben would be correct instead of nach belieben...  Thanks for the effort but marketing materials with mistakes don’t go well.  Edit: Bankensystem correct instead of Banksystem

Bitcoin Suisse currently offers btc and eth merchant services according to their website. I don’t know what exactly your point is, but yes, maybe bitcoin and other cryptos. No bitcoin is unlikely.

WTF only in the US.

Fair point, probably need to deduct non-unique accounts / fakes. Do you know if data for active users over time is available?

If the state just targets enough cases, they will be able to make quite some money

First by people being able to spend bitcoin and secondly by making the merchants familiar with how bitcoin works (on a basic level). Merchants could switch to "native" bitcoins later if they wish by just using their own wallet. Of course also publicity that comes with acceptance through a terminal helps.

Bitcoin is not against profit. Bitcoin doesn't care about profit. Bitcoin is built to prevent the state or other institutions to control money to their (unfair) advantage.

Not at all, no.

That was already available, e.g. at bitcoin.de. You had a bank account connected via Fidor bank. No real news, just another player.

Zerohedge is great as usual

Very well written, great detail, worth reading.

No, exchanges should not decide/ strongly influence a coins fate

Yes, to be more specific: The node works through my VPN but my main motivation was to provide "bandwidth" and data / information to the community, thus allowing inbound connections. 
I know that the full node makes me more autonomous but that is actually not my main driver (I am not running a business and do not have huge transactions to make). 
In my opinion for most "normal" people it is probably a bigger motivation to support a concept that they like than to be fully independent from third parties (which is still nice, I would agree).

1. Trying to provide something to the community (since I am located at a pretty "save" country / location)
2. Learning how user friendly it would be, which has an impact on how decentralized it could be and on how many people could decide to set up nodes to support Bitcoin
I think we should put more emphasis on supporting a free monetary system by running a node. For most people I would assume this is a bigger incentive than verifying their own transactions by not relying on third party information. From Marketing perspective it may be better to just state: "do something to support a free monetary system: run a node" instead of: you could look up your transactions and would not rely on their parties using your own wallet (which may not provide such high utility to the ordinary user)

Pretty repetitive article. Also doesn’t explain further why nodes with no outgoing connections are „just as good“ for security reasons. They only help the owner but wouldn’t broadcast so I don’t really understand how they truly help the system. What they do is use up bandwidth from others who share. Maybe I just over-read the explanation of that.

They are trolling you... You are lacking the background, connections and own funds.
