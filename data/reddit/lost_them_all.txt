No I did not. I seriously doubt that I would be able to recover my bitcoins in that case. But I will try anyways. At the very least, perhaps I can learn how it happened. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:41:24
What is this "common sense" you're talking about? If you claim that it should be common sense to know exactly what to do to protect BTC from thieves, then I can say it's common sense to know calculus, or to know how to perform heart surgery. 
Knowledge DOES NOT equal common sense

So with exit node sniffing, it's possible to obtain my login credentials without mistakenly being phished? 
I thought that all data between the user's computer and the blockchain servers would be encrypted. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:10:01
No I did not. I understand two-factor adds extra protection but I assumed that, since I would never use TAILS for anything other than blockchain.info, I wouldn't need this extra security step. 
Besides, I would then have to use an email with the wallet which adds a host of other possible exploitation points.

Thank-you. Your answer is one of only a few genuinely helpful answers.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:29:46
If you took the time to read the post you'd see it had nothing to do with being lazy
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:47:42
I never hook any email up to my wallets. All the info for my wallets is hand written on a paper so it couldn't have been hacked that way. 
I mean I don't THINK it could. Obviously I'm missing something here seeing as, despite my precautions, I was robbed.
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:21:12
Holy shit why are you absolutely fixated on a detail that has absolutely nothing to do with anything? Why are you obsessed with trying to draw conclusions out of thin air? I don't care whether you posted details of being scammed under your "real" handle or not. Are you so self-centered that you think everyone has to follow in your path?
Maybe you just don't understand what the purpose of this post was. Go back and re-read. No  where ANYWHERE do I write anything or ask any questions that require my personal identity to be known. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:49:02
There is a difference between common sense and lack of knowledge of a specific subject
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:46:38
Yes it is. Immediately after the thief reduced it to 0, some friends sent me some bitcoins they owed me (they had no idea I was stolen from). I transferred them out immediately luckily before the thief had time to get to those as well. 
But yes, it was reduced to 0. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:48:39
I don't see how that is relevant in any way whatsoever? Your suspicions are analogous to the government being suspicious of you for using an anonymizing  browser. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:50:09
My question was to help determine how my bitcoins were robbed. You started out calling "BS" on my "story" and then implying that if I don't have anything to hide, I shouldn't use a throwaway. Your comments were aggressive. Whereas mine were purely defensive.

I created the TAILS usb myself, and I insured I obtained the TAILS files from the proper website. I have been using this same USB from TAILS for a few months now (updating it on time every time through TAILS itself). However, I did not check the signature of the image. Perhaps that is where I went wrong.
No I do not ensure that I am using verified HTTPS blockchain.info. I am thinking that is most likely where I went wrong. I assumed that all info would automatically be encrypted and that I wouldn't have to do this manually myself. Stupid assumption on my part. 
Thank-you very much for your help. I now know a bit more about what happened. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:57:53
Take a look at the balance of the wallet that my funds were transferred to. In the last few hours, he/she has transferred 70 BTC to that account from various sources. 
Some of the individual thefts are as high as 10s of BTC! 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:52:43
Holy fuck what is with the judgement? 
Besides I am more interested in finding out how they were stolen first. THEN I'll worry about how to counteract it. Jumping right to the solution without understanding why is not a safe way to do things.
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:56:45
Thanks for the help. Yes I know that psychologically we are likely biased password choosers, and "choosing" anything in itself automatically means it's not random. But as far as brute forcing goes it is random. I very much doubt that it was brute forced. ESPECIALLY since this particular wallet was created only about 2 weeks ago. 
Yes, in the future I will have 2FA enabled. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:38:14
Yes I am using a throw away and yes I am a regular reddit user. Why the fuck would someone lie about this? What would someone gain from that? Not everything you read on the internet is BS
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:48:52
But how? I boot from a live USB into TAILS. I thought that every time you restart tails it essentially reverts back to the way it was prior to being booted up. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:55:34
Thank-you I didn't think of this. I believe I do have logging activated. I will check this later on in the day
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:49:28
I will do that soon. I have a good idea of what happened, and am working on creating a step-by-step process to avoid it. Both will be posted. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:16:34
Yes it was completely random. More or less 15 characters including letters, numbers, capitals and miniscules. Completely random. And I don't even use password managers. They are hand written 
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:09:35
Thank-you every for the help. I came here for 2 things: understand what likely occurred, and learn how to prevent it. 
After sifting through a truck load of dick comments, a few of you really stepped up and have helped me to find out what I need to learn to prevent this from happening again. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:58:45
No, no two factory. That would have prevented the theft, however I am more interested in finding out how the theft could have occurred in the first place. Likely, I was phished by connecting to a bad service node in TOR. 
General lack of the intricacies of computer science is what led to this theft. To everyone claiming it was "lack of common sense" that led to this theft, you don't understand the difference between common sense and knowledge of a particular subject. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:47:02
will you relax.. I am in the midst of answering questions. You can't expect me to instantly answer your questions. And the answer is no
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:44:23
As was mentioned in these comments, 2FA likely would not have made a difference in this case. 
I used TAILS so that I can have a completely isolated environment in which to access my bitcoins. The idea was to make it impossible to be phished by using a system that would only be used with trusted sites. I don't see how it "makes no goddamn sense." 
Where it fell apart was clearly my lack of knowledge of MITM attacks using Tor nodes. Again, this is not "common sense" as most people here claim. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:53:22
Thank-you. With the information generated in this post I should be able to counteract a similar theft in the future.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:46:09
The password was 15 chars long, numbers, capitals, etc. And I only access my wallet in my own apartment. No one saw it over my shoulder
