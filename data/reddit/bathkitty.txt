My local news today: “more tears in crypto currencies today, with the ‘token’ ‘coincheck ‘ suffering a hack costing some 500 million dollars to investors...”

Well done

All from the same, biased source. Perhaps consult An economics text outside the Austrian set.

Deflation is as bad as inflation. Why would you want a currency no one spends because it is constantly growing in value?
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:19:12
That is not At all what deflation is

or they understand how speculative bubbles function

Depends what you mean by "fail". Blockchain tech offers a lot of use value, and looks like it is here to stay. $5k BTC on the other hand represents an inflated perceived value not unlike a futures market. Not saying it's the same as speculating in magic beans but the use value, at least for now, looks similar.

Exactly. These articles pop up every time it looks like the market might go bullish again. Shameful

keep pumping, bro. there's one born every minute and you need to get paid am-i-right?

Enough of this. Y’all are like a flock of hens: “HODL, HODL, HOOODL”
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:53:26
not accurate. Breadwallet will be offering BCC for BTC
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:51:04
The value of BCC is subtracted from BTC

"abandon the gold standard after 5000 years"? Which countries in the world still use the gold standard?? it's all fiat as far as I know
