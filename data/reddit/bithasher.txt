Wow! You were able to buy bitcoins for $0? You only pay capital gains on difference between the price you acquired them at and the price you sold/bartered them at. If you are going to spend $100, then buy a $100 worth right before.

I was involved in an interesting unintended currency experiment at Woodstock '94. To buy anything inside of the festival you had to pay with Woodstock dollars. The organizers did this to take a percentage of sales from the vendors. The festival goers would convert $1USD into one Woodstock dollar. At some point the vendors would convert the Woodstock dollars back into USD at an exchange rate of 1WD to $.90USD or something like that. This way the vendor couldn't cook their books and tell the organizers that they sold less than they actually had.
Tax collection in developing countries is challenging. So a lot of countries fund their government through printing more money. Effectively taxing everyone using that currency. A developing country using bitcoins would lose that ability of taxation. Kind of a disincentive to use bitcoin as a national currency from the government perspective. It also makes corruption harder and these governments won't like that.
I think the main issue would be to figure out how to effectively tax people. One of the main function of a government is to provide services and infrastructure like roads, water, sewage,... In some of these countries these services are private. If I was in charge of a developing country, I would probably just focus on taxing the roadways and only accept tolls being paid in bitcoins.

I'm an Amazon Prime member. In the last month, Overstock has become my first stop when looking for something. Previously, it was Amazon. Overstock has gotten about $2k of my business that normally would have gone to Amazon. Most of that business has been via bitcoins but some of it has been purchase via credit cards because of business expense reasons. Overstock has gotten much higher value out of accepting bitcoins than a $1MM

I'm no tax adviser so don't take this as tax advice. If I was in this situation and I was going to spend $100 on Overstock via bitcoin and I was concerned with paying a high capital gains, I would buy a $100 worth of bitcoins from coinbase right before I made my $100 purchase on overstock. I would than calculate my gain/loss based on the difference with the bitcoins that I just bought from coinbase and the purchase. If done quickly enough, it would ended up being a small capital loss. This would allow those other gains to continue to age.

Here is my experience with my first time use of snapCard.
* 12:30 - Pizza ordered placed at 12:30
* 12:32 - Invoice received
* 12:40 - Invoice paid
* 1:20 - Domino emailed that the order was received. (It took 40 minutes from paying for SnapCard to place the order!!!)
* 1:40 - Still waiting for the pizza
* 2:00 - Pizza arrived
It will take over hour and twenty minutes to receive a pizza. For food orders, I don't think I'll use snapCard in the future.
I almost linked snapCard to my coinbase account but snapCard wanted the ability to debit an unlimited amount of money from my coinbase account. Yeah, no thanks. It might be a limit of coinbase app that I can't place a limit on much snapCard can pull out of my account.
Edit: Why did you down vote me? 2pm the pizza is here. The domino guy requested my credit card and took down my credit card number. It will be interesting to see if my credit card is charged for this.

The difficulty of mining is periodically adjusted via an algorithm. The algo is trying to have a block solved every 10 minutes. If people stopped mining bitcoins, the algo would make the difficulty easier and eventually on average a block would be solved about every 10 minutes.

I support any companies that accept bitcoins. I'll buy via Overstock even if I can find a better price elsewhere(within a 5% price difference).
I switched from eat24hours to foodler.com. I had never heard of foodler.com before someone mentioned they accept bitcoins. Turns out that foodler is better than eat24hours, grubhub or seamless IMO.
I switched to buying my coffee from  from Philz because of bitcoins. I've been actually doing blind tasting with various coffee that I have. Everyone loves the savor coffees. Hands down. 
I have bought pretty much every humble bundle since they started accepting bitcoins.
Tiger direct...
I have coffee, food, entertainment, household items and electronics covered.
It's interesting that I haven't had to compromise to support companies that accept bitcoins. In fact, I have discovered some great gems like Savor coffee.
By the way, I'm an early adopter and I don't want to pay capital gains on those early coins yet. So, whenever I buy something via bitcoins, I will first buy the amount of coins that I need and then spend those coins on the purchase.

In regards to BIP-100, where the miners decide the block size. Why won't miners always vote for the smallest block size possible? That seems like the right choice for them. Smaller block sizes should mean higher fees being paid to have transactions included in a block. Which means more profit for miners.
Though, I guess it could be possible to collect more fees by having more transactions per block. I doubt that.

Let me start with saying that I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin and lyft. I've been using lyft twice a day for several months. It would be a lot of work to get a good user experience for lyft to accept Bitcoins. With credit cards, lyft can pull the money from my credit card but with bitcoins I would need to push the money. I love the convenience of just hopping out of the car and knowing that the driver will get paid. Yeah, after hopping out of the car, you should go rate and tip the driver. So, I guess in that flow is where paying with bitcoins would happen. lyft could then prevent you from ordering any more cars until you pay for your last ride.

I feel like there is a better way to handle these 'high risk' transactions. It would be great to have been given me the option to either cancel the order or have CB hold the bitcoins for x amount of time. They could have emailed and told me that I have 12 hours to decide otherwise they would cancel the order. 
This just feels like they were hedging their bets and lost so they decided to pass that lost onto me and other users. I feels like Coinbase has scammed me. How can I trust that my other orders won't be canceled if there is a 10% rise in bitcoin prices?
It burns me even more that this was a recurring purchase that was setup a number of days before hand.  Couldn't they have determine that I was a 'high risk' and not allow me to setup the purchase in the first place.
My excitement level for coinbase went from being ecstatic about their service to thinking they are a bunch of snakes.

Managed to get out at $320. Just bought at $274 again. Another bounce up. Looking to get out at $315.

I bought some of those at $274. I just missed selling at $325 on the bouncing. Now I'm looking to sell them at $320. Hopefully, repeat a couple of more times. People really don't sell large blocks gracefully.

That would be very foolish to take a 10% penalty and then have to pay taxes on the gains from bitcoins when I could buy via this fund and pay no taxes on my gains. Yeah, the funds have some costs associated with it but tax free gains outweighs those costs. I wish this was an option 3 months ago. I'm sitting on 850% gains where if I sold today 35% of those gains would go to federal taxes and another 10% would go to the state. So  those 850% gains turns into 510% gains. Second Market's bitcoin investment trust would have cost about 4% for the same time period. I would be keeping 96% of the 850% gains so 816% gains. Based on your logic of trying to save money, you are actually losing a lot of money.
tl,dr: Buying bitcoin direct 510% gain over the last 3 months. Buying via SM's BIT fund from a Roth IRA 816% gains.

Who in their right mind is spending USD right now instead of buying bitcoins? A number of months ago, I audited my spending and decided to tighten the belt a bit and put everything that I saved into bitcoins. No more daily lattes, canceled DirecTv, started bring lunch to work, taking public transit, canceled a bunch of services that I wasn't using. Worked out to save me about $20 a day which I use to buy bitcoins. If bitcoins goes to $0, I don't really lose anything since I would have spent that money. It's been working out well for me.

They might honor the purchase this time... What will happen the next time the price jumps? Or if the price jumps higher? Coinbase has lost my trust forever. There is no way that I'm ever buying from them again or recommending them to a friend. I now need to go email everyone that I told about coinbase.

Unless you are buying and selling via cash, there is going to be a paper trail. I have no doubt the exchanges that I use will be reporting my sells to the IRS if not this year, next year. If you are outside of the US, it might be a different story. I'm keeping careful records of my buys and sells. I'm not a fan of taxes by any means but I doubt want to go through the pain of an audit and paying penalties.

I felt bad for coinbase when the price shot up like that and everyone was selling as fast as possible. It seemed like a glitch or possibly someone found a vulnerability. Perhaps that is why their fraud algo is mis-marking so many transactions as fraud.

If it keeps coming up then to me that indicates there might be a problem. How many threads do you see about changing the name of bitcoins? None or few so I think we are good on that but many people have an issue with satoshi.

Short answer: no
Slightly longer answer: Probably not. The difficulty is too high to make CPU mining profitable. GPU mining is no longer profitable if you have to pay for electricity. If there are some reasonably new AMD video cards, you might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit of profit from mining litecoins.

I'm pretty sure this scammer contacted me on Friday via localbitcoins. There were a few red flags for me that I ended up canceling the trade. The biggest red flag was he wanted me to send him the coins directly and not use LBC transaction service because it has been slow for him in the past. That was a huge red flag but when I checked his profile and it showed that he had no trade history, I immediately canceled the trade. 
I'm sorry you got burned by him. Karma will probably catch up to him pretty quickly.

Exactly the same thing happened to me. Though, mine was a monthly recurring purchase that I setup a week in advance. Not sure why they let me setup a recurring payment if I'm a 'high risk'. Plus, I allowed them to do a background check on me. It seems like their automated script to detect fraud is no where near perfect. I was trying to cost average into bitcoin. My plan was to hold on to these bitcoins for years. So, I wish coinbase would have given me the option to either cancel the order or have them hold on to my coins for a week or two longer if they thought I was going to attempt fraud.

This is exactly what I thought when I received that email yesterday. I've cooled down a bit and willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. It does seem really fishy that so many of these 'high risk' emails went out when bitcoins went up 10%. They might have sent out the same amount as usual but because bitcoins went up 10% more people are vocal about it.
I'm still waiting on a response from them. Regardless of the outcome, I'm going to wait a number of months before recommending any of my friends to use coinbase.
