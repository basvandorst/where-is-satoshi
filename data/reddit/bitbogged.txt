Because nobody uses bitcoin to pay with anything.  Wordpress just announced the reason they dropped bitcoin was because....TWO people per week were using it in 2014 and the amount of users has dropped since then.  So basically, the biggest open source web platform used by tens of millions of websites....had less than TWO sales per week using bitcoin.  Overstock undershot their expectations by millions of dollars.  Firefox projected 144k loss in a month by accepting bitcoin.  Accepting bitcoin is not only a waste of time, but in many cases discourages people from buying on top of it!

Because adding more choices makes people give up and exit the website.  And since nobody uses bitcoin, the loss of sales were not made up for in bitcoin.  People saw too many choices and exited the website.  Additionally while there was some sales the first few days, they largely stopped after that.  Just like Overstock, just like Wordpress, just like literally every company who accepts bitcoin, eventually people stop using it.  
Fact is there's 100k bitcoin users world wide and they aren't buying anything with bitcoin.  The most common thing to do with bitcoin outside of drugs and gambling is to simply hold it.  But don't worry, holding digital entries on a ledger will eventually lead to a successful currency.  Or not, who knows!

So that makes Satoshi 1 in 21!  And Roger Ver 1 in 52!  Totally not a pyramid scheme though (even though 800 people own 50% of the bitcoins).  Nope fully legitimate currency right there!
