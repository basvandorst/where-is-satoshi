Correct, and that is actually more or less one of the points I was trying to get across. It all comes down to convenience. Right now there's nothing convenient about Bitcoin unless that's your primary form of currency. The internet killed the fax when internet and email became more convenient to use.
What I'm, well, bummed out about quite frankly is how the Bitcoin community is treating someone who in my opinion has a completely valid argument.

You're not incorrect. You're just speaking logic amongst the sea of Bitcoin circle-jerkers. 
It's a lot easier for Auntie May to call up western union or go to the grocery store to send some money to someone, rather than her create a wallet, try to figure out how to use and secure it, hope that who she's sending Bitcoin to knows wtf they're doing, as well as maintain the value by some other stupid 3rd party means. 
Also, Square Cash (as well as some other services that do the same thing) is free, instant, and I've yet to hit a limit.
So again, you're not wrong, you're just in the money equivalent of Bunch of circle-jerks who don't care about anyone else's opinion but their own, and won't attempt to create a meaningful argument.

Didn't seem too believable to me, especially with the Bitcoin billionaire plug at the end.

So. Fucking. What.

Well, do you have wifi or not?!

Wow. Who the fuck said anything about government propaganda or corporations?

Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch, if you really wanted to make a donation you would.

OP wasn't dismissing Bitcoin, he was correctly pointing out that the advertisement wasn't painting an accurate picture of Bitcoin, to which he was called a:

ITT: a bunch of terds who'd rather graffiti and litter in the name of Bitcoin rather than actively trying to teach and show the public how it works. Is there a less cancerous Bitcoin sub? This is getting ridiculous.

Not a whole lot of people are ditching the iPhone for kind of a silly reason.

Just don't click on shit labelled as an "ad" on a google search. Pretty much all of those bullshit targeted ads are just bullshit targeted scams. I have a really hard time feeling sorry for people who get scammed by this kind of bs.

This is more of a BofA problem than it is an Apple one, and has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Thanks for the trashpost.

Is this all you say in this sub? Like, do you have no valid argument or rebuttal whatsoever? This I would say is a legitimate concern.

If you stumbled into this thread, turn around now, it's chock-full of stupid.

I haven't been able to find any unsubsidized ~$30 Android phones. There's some $30 Nokia phones through Mobal reminiscent of the old Nokia phones, but that's about all I can find.
[edit] ahh, found a couple at Wal-Mart, though looking at their specs it seems like going with one of these $30 Nokia's would be less frustrating in the long run.

Regardless, he broke the laws that are currently in place, tried to have people killed, and provided a means for terrible awful drugs, much worse than alcohol, to get into peoples hands.
He was innovative with the website he created, but it got out of hand and he let power get to his head.

This is exactly what I was looking for, and it looks damn nice too. Thank you!
