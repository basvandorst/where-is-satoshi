Well if you can distinguish the difference between those two acts then I would assume the average person would too, hell, some games even respect this mentality ("Police" AI generally notice the difference if you attack first or if a member of your party is attacked).

The only thing you need to worry about is whether or not your country enforces gambling licenses. If not, and bitcoin is not regulated as a currency then you're fine.

He said it's beside his street piece, meaning there's a piece of art beside the QR that you can't see in the picture.
Much more of a tip than begging. Not any different than someone putting their bitcoin address on their Github.

Are you sure? Definitely looks like there's a piece on the wall behind it. I'd hope not, a QR code is not art.

Yep. Still better odds imo. Plus if you understand the technology you'll understand that blockchain fills a void in our world in general. Unless there's another alternative, certain crypto currencies will prevail.
If only one crypto currency gets traction, that is one of ~1600 crypto currencies. That is still far better odds than winning the lottery (about 1 in 14 million).

With way better odds than actually gambling.

I've made more than $20 from less than $5 investment. It's about self control and making good choices.

You must be new to bitcoin. People talk about it "dying" all the time.

Well that's why we're posting about it in the bitcoin subreddit. It's kinda the whole point.
