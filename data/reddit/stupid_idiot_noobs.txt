Accepting the tip has nothing to do with pride. Most sane people would just take the free bitcoins and immediately sell them for real currency, its free money afterall.

When you put your money in a bank, it's no longer yours. It belongs to the bank now and you are simply a low-level creditor of the bank. If the bank loans the money and the person that borrowed it doesn't pay it back, your deposit is now destroyed. This is most especially true with bitcoin, since there new bitcoins cannot be arbitrarily created to replace defaults. If you deposit bitcoins with a bank, there is no guarantee that you'll ever see that money again. You can say that "oh well the bank can pay for insurance from a third party to replace lost deposits to defaults". However, there is no way to prove that the insurance company will ever pay back that money. So when you deposit bitcoin in a bank, you are throwing away the sovereignty you have over you money, and you are throwing away the assurance that that money will still be there for you.

There is a reason for this. It's the same reason why advertisements on television and the internet are flooded with products and services that you can buy as opposed to offers for work.

We easily see the amounts of money involved with that many coins.
The difference between you and us is that we understand that it is completely unrealistic to think that depositors will ever see even 1% of that amount returned to them.

Bitcoin itself is not. However, cryptotransactions may be. Bitcoin will be replaced many times over by better variations that utilize the same underlying concept that allows instant transfer of assets or contracts between people over a computer network. All major world governments will eventually have their own crypto linked to their national currency, which will actually be backed by something (i.e., all the goods and services of the economy of that country, legal requirement to pay taxes denominated in that currency, etc) rather than nothing as is the case with bitcoin. This will be a good development, especially with the flexibility it will offer different countries in applying appropriate monetary policies, which are unfortunately not possible to do with bitcoin (a major weakness that needs to be addressed in future variations and adaptations of cryptocurrency technologies).

Good for you. I hope you learned your lesson. $27k is getting off cheap, hopefully when you scrape up some real money you'll remember this time and do things differently, I.e.
1) not have all your eggs in one basket
2) have most of your net worth in actually valuable assets

Proof that dogecoin is a better alternative to bitcoin. Out of everyone I know, more people know about dogecoin than know about bitcoin, primarily because of stuff like this. Dogecoin is fun, bitcoin is boring.

If you want to put your bitcoins in a bank then you're not welcome here. This is an anarchocapitalist subreddit, we don't like banks nor do we like statists that want to have centralized control of money vis a vis the banking cartels.
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:33:51
Flabbergasted means surprised. You contradict yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:58:26
Nope. You're wrong on this one. The economy is a real thing. You can see and touch it every day when you drive your car, go to a starbucks, go to a restaurant, watch television, etc. Has absolutely nothing to do with faith. Every day I wake up I know that I have access to some of the best products and services available in the world and will continue to have such as long as I participate in this economy.


This is a good thing, there needs to be an enforcable way to collect tax revenues to build common infrastructure. Only idiot anarchocapitalists harp on this because they hate paying taxes to live in a modern society, yet they have no problem reaping the benefit of public investments.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:02:00
Well as you can see from the submission Dogecoin is making a positive effect on the world by spreading joy. I can't say bitcoin does this, which is proof that it is falling from grace.
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:50:10


No. That isn't what gives it value. If that were the case it would be worth nothing. What you're talking about is speculation. You are saying that you and I are both speculators who think that the value will remain somewhat constant. I can see why you think this way since bitcoin itself has a 'value' purely based on speculation since it lacks any real backing.
The truth is that the US dollar is backed by the full force and power of the US and world economies (e.g. oil is sold in US dollar) as well as the US government. That's what keeps its price stable, not some wishy washy idea that we all speculate that it's value will be this or that tomorrow.
I dont really care if a currency is cryptographic or fiat or gold or whatever. All I care about is what currency can I best transact in? And that is most certainly US dollar and Euro for most of the world. Once there is a currency that I can have the most ability to do business in, I will quickly switch. But using currency as a means of storing wealth is idiotic and I think that's a major problem with bitcoin supporters, that they see this not as transactional money but as a form of e-gold or e-real estate.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:43:50
No one cares about paper fiat money. Bitcoin sucks because it's for people who are just interested in getting rich without doing any actual real work; whereas dogecoin is fun because its about being generous and making people smile. This is why dogecoin will win and why bitcoin is on the way out.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:15:56
Nothing is going to stop it, the 'currency' is worthless and backed by nothing, people are realizing this and dumping it. That's how it has always been; bitcoin was never nothing more than an overhyped penny stock pump and dump scheme.
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:06:14
SaveGox is a pipedream proposal. It's never going to happen; these people have no authority to interject in these legal proceedings and if you think they are then I'm sorry to say that you've deluded yourself with wishful thinking.

Anyone that downloads this and executes it on a machine that stores their wallet files is asking to get robbed. Hopefully another idiot like the kid that lost $27000 in bitcoin from a chrome extension has this happen to him and we'll get to see another hilarious popcorn-worthy thread in this time next week.

Doesn't matter. You can force the captive to give up all of the keys under pain of torture.


Doesn't matter. You can force the captive to give up the biometric data that produces the keys. He's in your custody after all.


Doesn't matter. Enslave captive until the wait time has passed.


There aren't countless other methods.
The simple fact of the matter is that the way bitcoin is formulated it is in its nature that they are easy to steal. You're going to have to get over that.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:18:43
You'll get laughed out of the store. Why would anyone take bitcoin, it isn't real money.
@_date: 2014-04-26 19:19:10
Yes, a captor can hold ransom at $1 million but his chances of getting it through torture are much lower. See, if someone has that much cash sitting in bank accounts they're going to have to go through banking institutions to get at the money. There is no way to do this without major risk of alerting the authorities because this kind of money cannot be rapidly moved since there is requisite paperwork that needs to be done for preventing money laundering. 
With bitcoin on the other hand, you can trap a guy in a dungeon and torture him to death until he gives you his private keys. You don't care about outside institutions, and therefore there is no fear of being caught because you can just kill the guy and dispose of him when you're finished with him.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:37:55
No, idiot. is for talking about how dogecoin is surpassing bitcoin and is crushing it to a pulp.
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:40:40
Why do you care so much to have your employer pay you in BTC? It's all the same. You work and get given in return some currency that has value to be traded for things you need like food and shelter. Just take your paycheck and go buy your own bitcoin, it really is pointless to expect or force people to pay for your services in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:44:15
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:33:05


No, actually the problem is you. It's that you've been brainwashed to think that bitcoin is anything other than a valueless stock.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:48:18
obviously does seeing as this has already made the front page twice (once deleted, one is still up there) and I'm reposting it a second time because the mods are tyrants that want to suppress the good word about dogecoin and how it's doing positive things as compared to bitcoin (which is just really for greedy people that have no kindness in their hearts).
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:35:11
Which is an actual real, tangible thing that exists. Bitcoin is only backed by the fact that it is possible some other speculator will buy it for a higher price in the future. Nothing more than that. That isn't much of a backing at all.
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:29:40
Don't call people faggots you fucking nigger, that language is homophobic and offensive.

I'm well aware of that. Running software you don't trust opens you up to the potential that you compromise the password you used to encrypt your wallet. E.g. keylogging.

This is mostly about bitcoin, and how it's losing out to better alternatives.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:47:25
There is something statist about it, because when they hold coins it becomes centralized and a point of failure. Everyone has needs to become their own bank.
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:40:52
Just thought of something. We haven't heard of muggings for bitcoin yet but in the future, I predict high net worth individuals will be targeted by thugs. Once detained by these thugs, the captors will inflict torture on the individual to get the private keys out of their target on pain of death. Then they just steal the coin, and drop the sap off at some undisclosed location (or kill him).
You can't do this with other types of assets because generally high net worth individuals have their money invested in different assets all with different brokers, and keep cash and cash equivalents in banks.
So by removing this step of having to have your target get his money out of institutions, you can just directly rob him.
@_date: 2014-04-27 07:19:24
No. You're wrong. Bitcoins have been deemed to be commodity, which means that when you give them bitcoins as "deposits" the bitcoins don't belong to you anymore and you become a low priority creditor of the exchange. If the property goes missing then you go through normal bankruptcy proceedings and most time end up being last on the priority list for being paid back. This is how it has always worked and really how it should work. Bitcoin is not money so it shouldn't be treated as such in legal bankruptcy proceedings.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:31:18
The dollar is backed by two things.
1. The sum total of the US economy. All goods, services, and human capital that we produce and maintain.
2. The legal requirement that taxes are paid denominated in US Dollars.
Those two things are actually material backing and why the US dollar is remarkably stable as compared to bitcoin.
All hashing does is waste electricity. It still doesn't give bitcoin any real backing, its just a number game.
@_date: 2014-04-27 08:43:30
That's not what I'm saying. Of course they have the authority to make a bid on a company. But they can't make a bid on the company without funds. SaveGox is simply making a proposal, they don't have any money at all to make it a reality. And if they do, show me one iota of proof of that and the magnitude of the funding that exists to do a rehab. That's why I'm saying its a pipe dream.
