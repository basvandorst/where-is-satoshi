Why?  Even if you don't buy their products, competition is only a good thing for consumers.

My account was never verified and my password is unique to mtgox...not too worried about it.
My balance is still there...which is something...I guess...?

In the form of a prepaid mastercard that can take up to 8 weeks to get to you.

BFL is a sketchy company.  I wouldn't invest in one of these until physical units start appearing in the hands of the public.
That's why the Avalon's are so valuable--they actually have physical units out there that have been proven to perform at the levels Avalon stated.

The value of a bitcoin is also quite high compared to original batch 1 prices. 
If you assume BTC will somewhat maintain its value (say...&gt;$75), it'll pay itself off in a few weeks if you can get one at $6370.  Not a bad investment (though you'll never get a physical Avalon at that price...probably closer to $20-25k)

Bitfloor is the most painless from what I looked into.
Just fill out the deposit form on their website and take it plus the cash amount it states at the top to a Bank of America (no checks).  The fee was about 3% for me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:22:17
They've been saying that for a long time now.

I have a friend that would be perfect for this position.  Look him up on LinkedIn--his name is Tom Smykowski, former customer relations representative at Initech.  He lost his job due to an arsonist setting fire to the company headquarters.

I think ASIC pricing is going to change a bit here in the next 6 months or so as more of them get out there in public.  Gotta remember that, for the most part, the only ASICs out there are Avalon batch 1's.

Just make everything self posts and people can link to whatever from there.  No karma and (hopefully) no more memes.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:36:58
But people are willing to pay Gox prices when you sell locally.  And it's the closest exchange in value to China.  
If it states a price that people are willing to pay, then it's a fair value.  That's pretty much the definition of the word.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:59:32
Makes more sense to measure this in terms of a percentage.  If you started with 10,000 coins, this isn't very impressive.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:38:01
Back in that micro-bubble last March/April (?), there was always a big dip each week.
This is a sign of a more stable price...though the growth rate should make you cautious.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:01:04
I'm kind of disappointed...but at the same time my coins have more than quadrupled in perceived value in a matter of 6 months or so.
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:28:25
I remember me and a few other guys thinking about pooling in money to get an Avalon.  Glad we never went through with it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:53:40
On Bitfloor's site there's a way to deposit funds through Bank of America. The cash will clear in about 5 minutes from there and you can trade away.

All bitcoins will have been mined by the time BFL ships out their units.

Putting in my 2 weeks notice for early retirement after lunch today.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:54:42
Yep...just making sure they don't get too excited. A noob to bitcoin may think an hour of mining at 40 MH/s will get them $100 worth or so
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:16:49
Still need something to plug those USB chips into. Not to mention the gpus will hold their value a lot more than these USB chips.
I agree, it may be a little cheaper, but its still a crumby deal for something that's a dedicated miner.
@_date: 2013-05-05 04:45:52
There's ways to add more slots using things like pcie bridges/extenders. I've seen some guy runnin a rig with 8 gpus.

Well a regular bubble doesn't rise back up to normal value 6 months later.  Not really sure what term you want to use.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:29:02
With the right hardware, yes.
You could crossfire a couple 7950's and get pretty decent returns.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:17:59
Instead of asking reddit why these guys don't use bitcoin, why not ask them yourself?  They have contact info.  
Sorry, but this is an obvious cry for karma.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:12:46
Plenty of people buy bitcoins locally from others and they'll use the mtgox value.  I believe it's the closest to China's market as well.  It's a fair value in my book.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:32:04
I bet you put that real degree from a real school to a lot of work when you're using the trading software that does not require a shred of knowledge from what you learned in school.

We'll be knocking on the door of $175 soon.

Because they're doing fine the way they've been doing it their entire life.
I get it, we want Bitcoin to go mainstream, but can we chill out on the circlejerk for karma posts?  This is literally just a link to bitpay's charity section with no actual discussion.  Just a desperate cry for that sweet sweet link karma.

Sitting on money forever doesn't do you any good.

Should've had a current pre-order BFL model as the one that's "soon to ship"

Even as a currency to purchase goods, he has a point.  A bitcoin may buy half as much tomorrow as it does today.
Just imagine what's going through the minds of people that sold cars or real estate for bitcoin a week ago when it was worth double.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:00:20
I'm angry I didn't put more in at $145...and I'll probably be angry I didn't go in at $220.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:59:41
Potentially NSFW.
Saw someone selling a porno pass and the image was...uhh....graphic to say the least (the item was listed on the front page).  Not sure what's on there right now.

Back when Bitfloor was around, someone I know sold off a bunch of coins all at once--not even a drop in the bucket on an exchange the size of mtgox. Since Bitfloor was a smaller exchange, he caused a bit of a panic sell off which allowed him to buy back in at a much lower price and made a pretty sizeable gain from the situation.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:25:36
GT650 is pretty abysmal for mining (~20 Mh/s).  May have 4 or 5 bit cents after a month.  Could be worth a ton in USD in a month or absolutely nothing, who knows with what the market is doing.
Nvidia GPUs seem to be pretty bad when it comes to mining. A GTX680 mines at 120 mh/s while a comparably priced ATI 7970 mines at ~600 mh/s.
Honestly not worth the time setting up a gt650 to mine unless you just want to screw around.  Not really going to make any money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:32:34
Just figure out when the low is and know whether or not it will go back up as well as when the high is and knowing when it will go back down.
Pretty simple, right?
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:42:10
I like the idea...
but to the new folks out there, 40 MH/s for an hour is gonna get you about 1 ten-thousandth of a bitcoin, or about 2/3 of a cent.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:34:14
I'm waiting to see what happens when mtgox comes back up.  Could be lots of selling, driving the price down more.
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:43:59
Got an insider at mtgox, he says BTC could possibly be up to $250 or more tomorrow, and it could also go down to $40 or maybe even lower.
Hope this helps

People also pay more than 1 cent for old pennies.

My brother and I were considering going in on an Avalon back in April or so. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:35:23
I wouldn't count on ever getting anything from BFL until someone actually receives one of their units.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:27:46
Yup, just putting the warning out there. I'm sure the front page/featured listings changes all the time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:46:12
The people that claim "bubble" every time it crashes don't really understand what they're talking about.
The value of bitcoin dropped because the markets crashed, not because it's worthless.

When you feel comfortable.

Bought in at $145, sold off at $85 earlier today.  Plan on buying back in down the road, whether it be higher or lower.  I invested money I'm willing to lose, but that doesn't mean I should be dumb about it.

Maybe a little, but not really.
Silk Road is obviously popular, but it's not like there aren't substitutes for it.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:44:58
Not a very good price :/
300 at 2 BTC is 600 BTC or roughly $65-70k for 90 GH/s or ~$750 per GH/s
It's currently about on par with the cost of a ATI 7950, granted, I'm sure it consumes less energy, but the video card is going to hold its value way way better down the road.  In a year or 2, the video cards will still be worth $150-200 since they're still solid for gaming while these little units' value will drop like flies because the mining difficulty is only going up.
