Hi I feel for your loss and can't imagine the personal struggles you're going through right now. This will be a long journey and I wish you well. Stay strong.
I'm not a customer of yours and not directly impacted by the Bitfinex incident; I'm watching from the sidelines mostly for entertainment and have no skin in the game. But I do have some disaster preparation and incident response experience in cyber security (specifically financial services).
I'm not here to speculate, but I do find your company's response to this incident to be curious. Typically, disaster response to an incident of this magnitude and severity would require your firm to retain services of one or more external organizations with expertise in:
* Incident Response and Forensic Identification
* Legal Services
* Public Relations
* Consumer Services
These organizations all have specialized and specific roles and responsibilities to perform within the context of an incident. From the outside it appears your firm has done none of this.
It is important to use unbiased and impartial third parties to perform this work in order to:
* not jeopardize the results of an investigation
* retain and re-gain your customer's trust
In fact, it seems as if the entirety of this investigation is being handled with internal resources who could potentially be very close to the problem. You consistently refer to 'the team' getting the site operational again, your General Counsel appears to be handling legal matters, and your posts to Reddit appear to be the official channel and sole PR voice representing Bitfinex during this crisis.
Without a well-established framework in place I cannot understand how your firm will survive the fallout of this, much less the legal challenges you are about to face. This goes well beyond bankruptcy hearings - it is a *criminal* investigation.
 
Can you specifically and explicitly confirm that unbiased, third-party expertise has been retained in the areas outlined above? If not, specifically, which areas are being covered by external organizations? 
There is no need for this information to remain confidential and would go a long way to re-establish trust with your customers. I appreciate your reply. Thank you.
