What's your point? I'm not saying they should compete with people copying their product (which is, by the way, not the same as stealing). I'm saying that they should innovate, improve in respect to technological progress.
Piracy is just a service problem. If it is much easier to pirate somehting than buy it, sure I'll pirate it.
An analogy could be that someone is selling a product, but they aren't willing to ship the product but complain when someone else makes similar product and is willing to ship it.
I know, not the best, but if the service you offer is shitty, expect people to find ways around it. And in the end it doesn't really matter if you go for piracy or just use a more convenient competitor. The effect on the businesses that refuse to innovate is the same.

I had a very thoughtful reply before YouTube crashed my browser, but apart from all the other things that you are wrong about I'll comment just on the last paragraph:


This is simply not true. There are plenty of incentives not to pirate. Actually there are *only a handful* of reasons *to pirate*. The most prominent one is the fact that "it's free", but I'd argue that isn't the actual reason why people pirate stuff. Like surely *some* people will always pirate because it's free, but those people wouldn't buy your product anyway. At least you can hope that they like it, spread the word and someone else will buy it.
You know why I pirate movies? Because there is no way to even *buy them* in my country legally. And I just want decent quality content in english, ideally with optional original subtitles. But I can't even get that.
Another big reason people pirate things is DRM. It just fucks people over, especially in games.
And that... I think that's pretty much it. Compare that to reasons not to pirate: It's hard. You have to find what you are looking for, verify that it's what you are looking for, find it in decent quality. It's risky because you expose yourself to shady websites and software and could potentially get malware. It's often time consuming, downloads tend to be slow and download sites shitty.
Yeah, if the official service is worse than that, then you as a company are SOL, but that's why I said it is a service problem and that businesses should innovate. Selling DVDs is just no longer relevant, how can you cry that noone buys them? I don't even remember when I last used a CD drive - probably a few years back.


People have been pirating since the first stuff that could be pirated existed. The endgame is *this*. As in, there is no endgame. Some people will pirate. Some people won't. The world is not going to burn. And piracy has even gone down overall. Platforms like Steam only show that you can make people buy everything they used to pirate. And even stuff that they wouldn't pirate. Or stuff that they will not even play, ever. So clearly piracy is not an issue; if anything obsolete copyright and patent laws are.

Is that even the correct analogy? A fax is a device that uses *a* network (which will likely be tunneled over internet anyway) to connect to other similar devices.
So if anything I think we should be talking about computers and emails and stuff replacing them.
And it's not like they are not being replaced. I don't know of a company that would be like "yeah email is nice but let's use fax too it's awesome tech". They use it just because *they didn't stop using it*.
Ninja edit: apparently I was already proven wrong by the Japanese. Fuck them.

You could base it on known wallet adressess.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:57:56


As if they ever wanted to innovate and try out new business models and practices.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:05:25
Not sure if it is still possible, but half a year or so back I had successfull transactions with no fee. And they didn't even took *that* long (some half a day or so) to confirm.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:58:44
If there is no better investment opportunity and you don't need the cash, there is probably no reason to sell the coins.
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:57:40
That can happen with fiat too. Depending on your bank and local law it may not be possible to recover lost money. Especially when sent internationally.
But this discussion wasn't really about mistakes people do... those just happen with every system.
I could argue that with bitcoin when you send the coins it is thankfully not subject to chargebacks and similar stuff. Thaat may or may not be beneficial, depending on the point of view.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:29:31
That's true. I think dollars are used to fund terrorism most of the time. They should completely ban that evil thing.
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:00:54
And what I think will really happen: Nobody will really give a shit. The only people who'll have to solve such issues are actual US exchanges and US retailers. But they could use exchanges' services. Why would a miner give a damn? He can just act as if he wasn't from the US. Noone can really trace the mined coins to them unless they want to.
@_date: 2014-01-13 16:29:26
Moral of this story: buy from the source, official retailers, whenever possible, and check the reviews of a seller before you buy from him. Once you buy the product, it's unlikely anyone will effectively help you.

He transferred the money cross-country to many people. If you did this with your bank, the fees would be immense. You'd have to pay 80 times the cross-country transfer fees (which are huge, especially for developing countries). If you wanted to pay a little amount, say, 2$ to every one of the 80 people, the loss would not be 15%; you'd have to pay more for each transaction than the amount you are transferring.
I was just receiving Euros on my Euro account in Czech Republic from Germany (we are neighbour countries). And from the €50 I received I had to pay €3.87 in transfer fees. And there was no currency transfer, we are in the EU and the transfer went through like one or two other banks at most. So it is incredibly expensive. If I could use bitcoin for this, I would lose what... maybe half that in conversions? Something like that. And that is just a regular transfer, not something fancy to 80 people world-wide.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:25:37
Yeah, miners are nice to us, poor people :)
I did that only because it was just a merging transaction from several adresses to one, most of them with really, really tiny amounts. I didn't care when it arrives and it didn't make much sense to pay for it.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:44:51
Oh well, then that's either because my bank is ripping me off or because the bank in German was some odd, obscure one. I don't know, I don't make transfers like that regularly.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:52:18
Because you will keep the one key somewhere safe. At least they are both on different devices, or one is in a cold storage.
@_date: 2014-09-20 11:23:25
By giving keys from a car or a house to someone you don't transfer ownership. That is a much more complicated (legal) process. With bitcoins, keys = full control = ownership.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:45:27
Because the point stands: You will pay either way for *each transaction made*. That is you will pay 80 times transaction fee if you send money to 80 people. With Bitocoin the fee is not only smaller; you pay it once per transaction, which in this case can include all the people you send money to at once.
Also, I know for a fact that non-SEPA transfers are really expensive due to how the money is transferred through other banks.

The user-unfriendliness, lack of client support and knowledge necessary to even have *signed* emails is why it's not used.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:40:15
Well whatever, I don't math, but just something in the lines of that.
@_date: 2015-05-18 09:09:42
Let me give this example: Avengers: Age of Ultron [made a billion dollars in the first month]( Which is like 2.5 times more than it cost to make. In the first year the movie will be mostly done in terms of revenue. After four years noone will really remember it. So yeah, I think they did make their money.
And please don't twist my words. I was talking about copyright, which is relevant for each separate work, not whole franchise. So by now you would be free to redistribute the first season of Game of Thrones, but not the others. Again, HBO has made their money. If there are people who are waiting for the whole series to be done before buying the whole franchise and watching that, HBO can still make money from that. When the last season is done, they would still have a lot of time to distribute the whole season together and make money off of that.
The same applies if you make a new movie based on the old IP. A new Star Wars movie would be protected, just not the old ones.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:08:40
Oh, I would totally do that, but I can't persuade all of the people on my contact list (hell - I can't even persuade the ones I care about) to use it too, which makes encryption unusable and signing useless.
And the truth is that nobody is really reading your email unless you are dealing with super secret stuff, in which case you shouldn't be using email in the first place.
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:53:50
So you are arguing that the vast majority of artists doesn't make enough money off of their art to live from it. How would shorter copyright protection hurt them? Have you considered that interpreters who perhaps aren't so good at making their own music but are great at playing others' could suddenly make money by doing just that? Or that people who are great at making remixes and such could do so legally after several years and make some interesting art that way?
As I said, bands and musicians make most money on stage. And people want to see a particular artist perform, they don't necessarily care about someone else who performs it few years after it was popular.
And again, four years were an example. It would make sense to make some copyrights last longer and some less. My original point was that *seventy years after your death* is really excessive. And it also doesn't mean that there couldn't be *some* form of entitlement to what you made even after that - you could make it so that when someone managed to make shittons of revenue on your work after its short copyright expired you would still have the right to get a portion of it.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:27:45
I didn't say *no* copyright, I said it could be shorter. Nothing would still prevent the authors to say "here sign this I'll give you the rights to my play but you will give me money for the first ten years when you play it". If they don't accept they'd have to wait those four years first.
And I used four years as an example. It would be sensible to make it longer for some types of content and shorter for other. But 70 years *after the author's death* is excessive as fuck.
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:08:24
Well he could increase the price by 7% and have 7% discount for bitcoin users... :-)
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:53:37
I guess the point is that there is basically *no guarantee* that there will not be a double-spend. Nothing prevents it, you just don't have the confirmation. Even single conffirmation makes it so secure that it would not be financially worth it to even attempt a double spend there.
@_date: 2015-05-17 21:05:00
I don't think anyone really thinks there should be no copyright. But do you really need to have your awesome photos protected 70 years after your death?
As someone else said, the majority of income from new products comes from the first 18 months of sales. Wouldn't it be enough if your work was copyrighted for four years? With the ever-increasing demands for quality and always changing society the photos are mostly outdated by that point anyway.
Well... Stock photos aren't necessarily the best example here, but movies and music? The creators make most money by playing music live on concerts and movies make most money in cinemas. Removing copyright wouldn't really change that much.
And it would not only speed inovation (if we removed patents and such), it would also create new markets like content delivery.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:50:47
Two years after it is publicly available should be fair enough.
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:12:58


You mean that the copyright would be expired on the first season of the show and the first four books?
Yeah, why not. they have made their money, and it's not like nobody would buy the books to support the author or something. They would still get sold, because if you want to get the book digitally for free, you can anyway. It's not legal, but who cares if they can't catch you?
So yeah, I don't think anything would change, really. For most people anyway. And for those that already made billions for selling it... you know, it wouldn't hurt those people either, it wouldn't ruin their business.

Is there any point if you in the end can't or won't do it? You know governments don't need reminding that they need their citizens. Even medieval society needed people working for the king. They could easily overthrow the "government" if all the people - including vassals, soldiers and "free people" or whatever - just wanted to do that. The king is nothing if his underlings decide to ignore him. A senate has no power if the people don't listen to them. Today, if police - who are just people like you and me - wanted, they could tell the government to fuck off.
Especially today, when just not paying taxes can't get you killed you don't need guns. Just stop paying taxes. Do barter trade or use some cryptocurrency. Together with other millions of your countrymen. The government can't do anything about that.

@_date: 2013-12-07 21:13:12
Sure, but they definetly should wait for several confirmations, right? I mean there could be a blockchain split and they could accept the transaction, deliver the product/service and then few blocks later find out that the transaction didn't really happen. So while you can pay and get the announce instantly, you should still wait for  confirmations before allowing the customer to take the goods, right? And that seems quite impractical.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:52:18
I thought double-spends without chain fork are impossible (apparently, they aren't). But still - imagine that Bitcoin is really widely used. There can be only one chain fork a year, but that feels too risky. Potentially thousands of transactions could be invalidated.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:07:02
And then wait ~30 minutes untill the transaction gets accepted in the blockchain, no?

The civilised Europe has it as a law, but for example in our country (and several neighborhoods) you don't have chargebacks, unless it's *supported* by your bank. It's now getting better with more banks accepting complaints, but it's not universal. The only option you had before was to get in a court with the fraudulent company. The only thing present is with actual thefts - should someone steal your credit card and take money from it, you could get the money back from the bank if you reported the theft soon enough. Nothing to protect you from frauds from companies or thefts you didn't notice soon enough, though.
