OH. MY. GOD. DELL IS PRETTY MUCH AS VALUABLE AS GOOGLE

That's the nature of bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:07:32
That's OP's point. He was told differently by a misinformed rep.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:44:09
Um, please show me where else I can get an Amazon $100 gift card for under $75.

Imagine all the potential scams possible on the elderly and clueless with bitcoin. And then who do you complain to?
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:21:35
Maybe he can call the police for help... teehee
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:16:59
I'm talking about stuff like Nigeria scams and all that stuff.

Dude, you're getting a Dell

The big three are: Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns. 
How do I know that? Because I've never heard of the others you listed (apart from Little Caesars). LOL
And I agree that Papa Johns is the best of the big three.

LOL. You can just get a chargeback and not lose money at all. You can't do a chargeback on bitcoins.
Plus, I thought scammers always wanted money transfers/wires.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:47:02
Wiring money to those guys isn't as easy as sending bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-22 22:08:46
You could still be refunded in bitcoins by taking into account their current value...
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:21:17
It is the owner that said that. He is the ultimate source. Yes, I'm the troll for providing the best source available on this transaction. LOL Calling people trolls does not make reality less true.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:26:14
The owner himself said that if he had had to hold any bitcoins for any amount of time he would not have done the transaction. He only accepts USD.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:44:28
He already spoke. He said what I've been telling you all along. Why don't *you* ask him to see if he misspoke? He already made his statement clear in that interview.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:25:28
I just checked to see if there were any corrections to the story I posted. There weren't.
His statements were clear. It doesn't seem he misspoke because there have been no changes or retractions of his statements. The assumption that he knows more about the transaction than you do is obvious. 
Don't be angry when the primary source, who knows the most about the transaction, contradicts what you're saying. That's the reality.
He obviously has more credibility than you and everybody else commenting on this story. I will believe what he's saying, not a stranger on the Internet that had nothing to do with the business or transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:23:16
Who's the dumbass, someone that gives the primary source who actually completed the transaction more credibility, or someone without any firsthand experience themselves that thinks they know more than the seller? :D LOL
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:28:22
The owner himself never owned any bitcoin. In the interview he said he never held any bitcoin and that he would not have done the deal if he had had to accept bitcoin. He said he only accepts USD.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:55:31
I was just pointing out what the owner himself said about the transaction. We cannot know what he did exactly unless he goes into more detail.
But he did say that if he had had to do the transaction using bitcoin then he would not have done the deal. He compared it to someone trying to buy a car with gold.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:40:09
If you watch this interview he said that if he had ever had to hold any bitcoin at any point he would not have done the transaction. It does seem pretty simple to me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:31:38
The owner himself said they would not accept bitcoin as payment. He compared it to a customer trying to buy a car with gold bars. He wouldn't accept it. He said he only accepts USD.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:02:24
There doesn't need to be any correction. I get what he's saying. His statements stand on their own. It's what I've been saying the whole time. 
Everything I have been saying is just repeating what he said in the interview. You keep repeating that the owner either misspoke or didn't know what he was saying.
The owner, and the person who knows the most about the transaction, is saying you are wrong.
I never made any assertions myself. I'm repeating what the owner said. My point is that I'll believe what he says over what you say since you don't know more than he does. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:45:25
This is the interview where he says if he had ever had to accept bitcoins as payment he would not have done the deal.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:48:14
"It does not make a shit what he said."
Yeah, because you know better than the owner about how he handled the transaction. LOL
And that was not my analogy. It is, once again, what the owner said himself. Learn reading comprehension.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:00:10
If you watch the interview he says he doesn't accept bitcoin as payment and would never. He said he only takes USD.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:08:02
So apparently you know more about how the transaction took place than the owner himself. If you watched the interview you would see that what he is saying is very clear. There is nothing to be confused about.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:34:26
Yummy, huh? :D
