Mark Karpeles, one of the operators of Mt. Gox. 
Mt. Gox, was a place where you can buy or sell bitcoins. It was based in Japan. A lot of people lost their money there. Details on wiki.

* I work in the farm. 
* Cut grass, 
* chop some wood, 
* repair tools, 
* take care of kids, 
* mod r/bitcoinrealestate 
normal life stuff. I've been hodling a piece of land and the fundamentals are the same for hodling. In farm life, you literally take a piece of yourself and sacrifice it for the land. The hard work shows in the years. You plant some vegetable, it gives you food. Then you have to move and coordinate with nature. Nature says 'typhoon" you could be facing a 90% drop in value of the crops you sweated, worked hard for. Nature says, "Ok, I will be predictable." then you reap what you sow. Put little effort, get little reward. Put a lot of effort - it would depend on how smart you "efforted". 
So, win or lose, farming is not very easy. 
Dad was right, he says, "In other businesses, you get old, you get tired - but if you're a lawyer - the older you are, the wiser you get." 
So, time to sell and let go. Time to stop hodling for me.

Perhaps, you are referring to the sub I made for [Bitcoin and Real Estate]( 
I've been trying to market our own property to achieve this, to no success. But, who knows, maybe in the future, when the investment climate is more suitable. 
In the Philippines, there's a big question mark on "Human Rights". Real estate is mostly about "property rights".  Which is more important? ~Something to think about. Thanks, ~danny [mod] of r/bitcoinrealestate

Hahahaha. I friended you and saw one of your comments. You were in Bali and lived in a Villa. James has been to Bali. Hahaha. By the way, I liked the podcast of Tim Feriss and James. - The power of saying No. A little long, but it gave me an idea of James as a person. Serial entrepreneur huh. Wow.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:54:10
Nah. If he were, he won't use his own name. There are so many scams in bitcoin world. I've heard of Jaltucher before, long time ago. I think James is an honest guy.

@_date: 2017-10-15 23:03:49
bitcoin? Not if you have [real bitcoin businesses that hire people]( Remittance is a VERY VERY big market in the Philippines. Filipinos who work abroad send money to the Philippines on a regular basis. There are more than 10 million abroad who have family at home. It's what's keeping our economy afloat despite all the negative press.
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:34:44
From the market perspective, we will see that soon enough. From what I can deduce, historically, some of the major fluctuations are caused by governmental regulations. It could be affected if governments try to restrict bitcoin to the extent that it becomes unfeasible to use it over other cryptocurrencies. 
From a P.R. perspective, it is creating some sort of stigma to the non-knowledgeable general public. But for industry insiders, everybody is just adopting a wait and see attitude. 
If we think in terms of utility and future usage - the potentials are still enormous granted that bitcoin is able to sustain and scale to growth. 
You just have to ask yourself - how will you pay for that Uber ride 2-4 years down the line? How do you want to pay your bills 2 to 4 years from now? How do you want to buy domains? Etc. 
If bitcoin is honestly there in your answer - then there you have it.

-- One of my concerns is btc volatility. So there is a slight price difference. This is actually one of my problems. The price could increase or decrease dramatically.
@_date: 2017-07-02 05:14:04
Sorry, I was totally using different context for the two. I meant to say, "sell" the property. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:06:21
and now i'm selling my house/farm to you, come to the philippines. i need to make some changes of my own. i'm selling at 75% market value just to get coins.
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:07:48
Dunno how to start. There's a lot of pump, dump, hype, scare, fud, bull, bear, push, pull talk out there. Too many. I just want to be able to 1. Do normal transaction using bitcoin, (for example, like selling our property) 2. Do it in the most cost-efficient way with no drama - come on 99.99% of us, don't need to know jack shit about all of bitcoin's drama.

"Don't be an asshat."
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:41:28
That is accurate and true. The fiat value that I assigned is slightly lower, and we have to go through the tax authorities for the successful title transfer - I don't know yet, whether they will accept it. 
This property is best managed by people with the financial wherewithal to run it according to its maximum use. I have come to terms with the fact that I cannot run it anymore - it is draining our finances simply for the running expenses that occur on a monthly basis. 
It's time for me to let go. 
If you think about it, I may be a real time **master HODLR** for holding on to this property for 8 years. It is time to sell. I'm working out which listing sites to post it on. Can you recommend any? I only see two, bitpremiere and bitcoin real estate. 
To be frank, ethereum may be the appropriate cryptocurrency here, but I opted for bitcoin.

Consider outsourcing non-critical support to the Philippines. &lt;3 Poloniex
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:51:25
It's all about task prioritization so the good people over at Poloniex can focus on the **real problems** - the mission critical aspect of the business.
| Outsourcing customer service is a great way for companies that don't care about their customers to save money.
That is your opinion, and I respect that. Customer service is indeed a very challenging feat - one has to **filter** concerns from the least to the really serious concerns. 
During my stint as a younger man and as a technical support agent working for Microsoft Networks technical support, we were the filtration layer. You know why? Because anything - any concern reaches a publicly known number or contact point. 
There are many stories about customers who were having problems with their printer - only for them to discover that it wasn't plugged in. 
Our lady work mates, would always get calls asking about what they were wearing. 
Sometimes, "high" or drunk callers, would just call and mumble something about their Internet. 
Then their were the dangerous ones that wanted to get into other people's MSN email addresses.
There were calls about several non Microsoft related things and if you factor all of these - in any growing company, it takes a toll, it takes effort, it takes time and **it costs a lot of money** to simply to filter out these "issues". 
I'm very new to the cryptocurrency game. I only see the general aspect of Poloniex as a business model, its profit model and its weaknesses. I can see why they are getting overwhelmed with so many concerns flying about here and there, the DDOs attacks, the challenges of maintaining liquidity in a very volatile sphere and - customer service. There's so much potential, there's so much avenue for further growth - especially if you factor in the distinct possibility that crypto is being stage set to replace fiat within our lifetimes. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:28:07
Ya, I just checked, just wait a bit. I'm in contact with them. Didn't see the - pending approval bar.

Hi, I am selling my house for bitcoin or ethereum or litecoin. How much are you thinking? Plus. I am a licensed real estate broker - here in the Philippines.

what happens if the internet goes out? shut off in a certain part of the US? Say an EMP is detonated somehow. Power, communications. all electronics - all down?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:18:51
This will be a highly unpopular opinion but I've been meaning to suggest this didn't feel the courage to do so, but I highly recommend outsourcing - specifically to the Philippines.
Microsoft, JP Morgan, Accenture, IBM, Chase, HSBC, Google, Facebook, yes they've all set up support and customer service centers here. 
A major factor would also be market penetration - I've recently come into contact with the founder of a series A funded fintech that relocated - yes - relocated to the Philippines, the founder of coins.ph, a bitcoin payments processor (I use them to pay my bills and load up my phone). 
Ron saw the potential for all the remittances being sent home - and saw bitcoin as the solution. That's $26.9 billion being sent home on an annual basis. 
Do seriously consider it - and if you happily relay this suggestion, we could discuss the idea. Outsource the support, bring back the trollbox, less hassle for you guys, to help you focus on more mission critical matters. Serious business.
Full Disclosure: I'm from the Philippines. :)

I feel you. I live in the mountains and I got a dinky little pocket wifi. Missed the BTC spike as well as the ETH spike because I was not fast enough to click "Buy" button. Lost not a few good trades.
