Will do!
I have set up a discord for those to talk about what they would like me to get :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:50:36
Honestly this looks like a sell out rather then a dip...

Hi, What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:52:01
Hi Rapgab, that iss a great idea, Currently the homeless situation in cork city is something i see every day, I do understand this is great for advertisement but my own interest is to help those who I can.
I'll be glad if this works to help organize some bigger movement but maybe we start small?
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:59:53
hey brad, glad to hear your interested, this started off as an idea for awhile and decided to share it last night, gained some interest so if we get the traction we need for funds I will take a few days off work and go about for a few nights handing out the gifts :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:06:09
Of the original post? Currently it's still up. 
 I made a few edits to include the link
 
Can you read the original post at all?
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:14:29
If you want to organise it I have an idea.
Currently there are alot of homeless on the main Street of cork city. We could organise a bitcoin pizza party for them or just hand them out and around, with scarfs and gloves aswell 
Can make sure to have video and receipts for the community

Something is wrong. I believe perhaps regarding the moderating team. I will post all information on separate subreddit. I might need to get in contact with them.

Are you looking to get access to their computer or their wallet for coins?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:49
Brute force best bet... Few programs out there.
 Can take weeks or month
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:30:29
Currently at the moment it's going stable.
Slot of those who have invested before the spike have doubled there investment and have secured themselves.
Have feeling next week might go up after the public sees it can maintain a stability high value.
Also wall Street taking on bitcoin in January

Contact support? Transferring errors always happen in every market

There is a limit of bitcoin but you can sub divide to infinity, 
It’s programmed in a way to prevent inflation and to increase value of the currency. Every transaction deducts from the circulation so those fewer coins become worth more
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:14:25
Oh my mistake, my understanding was the transaction fee was removed from existence. Cheers for correction :)
