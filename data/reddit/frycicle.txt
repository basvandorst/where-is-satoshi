Then why did Gavin just tweet about regretting talking to the reporter?
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:07:29
I don't know what that proves. It could be the same person. I write very differently to different people. I don't think the difference disproves the theory.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:06:55
That's exactly what he would say if he wanted people to stop bothering him.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:45:04
I want to try it, but I'm stuck on the waiting list...
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:38:23
I'd prefer just type in how many I have and it track the price from there.
@_date: 2012-06-08 21:04:04
This could be a bubble too.
@_date: 2012-06-07 23:54:51
Roughly six times higher at 1 point. 
@_date: 2012-06-07 23:53:10
Lol. I feel like this is last summer with all the hype.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:51:27
Ha well obviously I was wrong, but at the time there was all hype and the tech was still semi immature. I did hedge my bet and bought a couple at $300, so I'm doing ok. I watched bitcoin go from $32 (or something) to $8, so I was a bit jaded then.
The thing I've learned about Bitcoin is it's entirely impossible to predict, so just take a small gamble. But hey, I could be wrong.
@_date: 2011-06-07 14:10:09
I have a few customers so far. And no I am not shady, I provide links to my skype and eBay.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:48:18
It is more expensive short term, but may be cheaper long term because you get funds quicker.
@_date: 2011-06-11 13:37:22
The 5000 series has more shaders and is faster at mining 
@_date: 2011-06-18 20:08:58
This link title is so wrong. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:49:36
Just the 5000 series. The only other card effected is the 6990. All the other 6000 series are sticking at their price points.
@_date: 2011-06-05 18:40:07
Unless you get something like this, don't bother.

@_date: 2011-06-05 22:23:57
So can cash. His point isn't good.
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:15:50
They can't really do that. What if a innocent guy was selling those coins or the guy was lying about the lost coins and he just sent them to another account? It is not ethical to try to intervene.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:03:02
It's at 19 again. What is your point?
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:24:38
But for real, you should give those back. How would you like your hard earned bitcoins stolen?
@_date: 2011-07-25 12:26:00
I can only hope.
@_date: 2011-06-05 04:21:46
For $110 you can get a 5830 that will do near 280 Mh/s.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:33:24
I'll help you, because I'm feeling good right now. Sent .01 BTC. You don't have to have the client running.
@_date: 2011-06-26 21:07:33
Depends on how big you'll think they'll get. If they stagnate or even double, it's not worth it. But if they go 100, 1000 or more, it is definitely worth it.
@_date: 2011-06-17 23:01:20
I think it is usually a year or 2. You may have gotten lucky.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:02:37
Install linux on it so you won't get hacked.
@_date: 2011-06-06 17:30:32
What was dishonest about that?
@_date: 2011-06-04 01:55:13
MT GOX is your best bet, with Dwolla to get funds out of your bank.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:42:32
It told me I have over 9000 bitcoins! A miracle product here! More valuable than a 7 legged spider!

@_date: 2011-06-06 16:33:07
I haven't either. That why I would keep using them.
@_date: 2011-06-09 14:40:00
Yeah, isn't the server hidden?
@_date: 2011-06-07 14:10:57
I mostly go on gut. You really can't go on anything else.
@_date: 2011-07-17 06:00:40
I agree. You can do it, but most people won't put the effort in.
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:10:48
People think it's bad because it is so large and the fees are high.
@_date: 2011-06-06 00:47:18

I like how Mt Gox's Volume is close to 3 times Tradehill's. I guess some people still trust them.
@_date: 2011-06-01 19:19:59
Second sale! It was a big one!
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:54:00
Yes, because they couldn't track me anyways.
@_date: 2011-07-21 22:19:08
I know the OP pretty well.
@_date: 2011-06-05 19:23:48
5830 is.
@_date: 2011-06-04 12:54:43
Really really cool.
@_date: 2011-06-27 12:38:18
Saw that this morning. I was like "Hooray, it's almost all green!".
@_date: 2011-06-05 17:25:20
They are going to have a tough time shutting it down since almost everything about it is anonymous. 
@_date: 2011-06-10 02:53:28
6950 and 5750 together at 490 Mh/s
Soon to be getting 2 new 6950s, which should go to 700 Mh/s. Selling that 1st 6950 if anyone is interested.
@_date: 2011-08-04 22:03:02
It is still the same forum, it was just moved to a different address to keep the .org more professional.

If it is centralized, I don't trust it. Someone will always be greedy and power hungry in a centralized system.
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:53:26
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:40:14
No. I was just saying it "could". Chances are that it wouldn't.
@_date: 2011-06-17 03:12:57
If you didn't see this coming, you aren't very familiar with computers.
@_date: 2011-06-03 22:29:06
Since a 6990 has 2 GPUs and a 5850 has 1 it isn't possible. He would need liquid nitrogen to get it that high.
@_date: 2011-05-28 23:25:04
I have feedback on OCN and eBay to check out. I understand you're a bit weary, but I'm trying to help out the bitcoin economy (and myself to a smaller extent). I will also use Clearcoin if you want to try that before I get lots of great reviews.

Idk. Are your doing something else in the background?

@_date: 2011-07-01 18:45:47
Very much agreed.
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:58:53
Somebody is greedy. You want all the stolen bitcoins to yourself.
@_date: 2011-06-03 03:49:55
Can you imagine what would happen if the government did that? The answer is that there would be no more government. There would be a huge revolution against them. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:00:15
I'm 100% manual. I think I will keep it that way for now. I can serve the customer better and they have a more personal experience. I don't want to grow too large, but I plan on being able to serve more people as time goes on.

@_date: 2011-06-23 22:31:34
I have had no issues with that. Both of my 6950s chug along at 330 Mh/s.

Not nearly as fun though.
@_date: 2011-08-01 12:42:54
I think this is false. It very well could fail. Their are numerous possibilities in which it could fail, but I see the biggest issue being government intervention. The government might not be able to stop the blockchain, but it could fuck over anyone trying too accept it publicly and shut down the exchanges.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:59:55
I mostly want Atlas to see it. On the bitcoin forums he is trying to get bitcoins for Ron Paul. lol
@_date: 2011-06-27 17:18:26
It was 17.50 before the hack.
@_date: 2011-05-30 16:35:37
They messed up. They said the guy on TwiST said bitcoin are the worst idea ever, when he actually said they are the most dangerous, as in it could rule the economy. 
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:24:47

Not worth it. 
@_date: 2011-06-04 14:13:37
I edited the comment. And no, it uses 4 5830s. 2 6990s would be $1400 by themselves.

Even then, they only have so many servers. They aren't google and they only have 2 employees. Don't use it if you don't like it.

The market moves too quickly for trading different markets. You could day trade, but it is pretty risky.

He has already paid it off a long time ago.
Edit: I know the OP
@_date: 2011-08-03 19:36:18
Merchants could use something like bit-pay.com , so they can accept bitcoin, but get paid in dollars.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:59:09
I signed up, still a bit more expensive than Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2011-06-05 21:52:19
They pull less than 200W. I don't think even dual GPU cards pull 500W.
@_date: 2011-06-17 16:42:50
It takes at least an hour to move BTC across markets. Good luck trying to do that before the market even up.

You could buy Mt Gox USD from people or buy bitcoins on ebay.

You needed a reason. That would be my reasoning for buying some.

@_date: 2011-05-29 19:08:49
You could split it up too. Like 40% Bitcoin, 40% Gold, and 20% Silver. The only issue is that Bitcoin could crash, whereas the other 2 options are much more safe.
@_date: 2011-06-02 13:00:33
I see what you're trying to do.
@_date: 2011-06-05 19:23:38
5830 does around 280 MH/s at $110.

Looks cool. I'll try it.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:14:43
For every 1 dollar they are taking .0065 cents out. That isn't terrible in my eyes.

If they have good GPUs, you will rake the cash in. If not, it is really a waste.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:52:10
It went from 18 to 30 to 19. Problem?
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:58:07
I have plenty. I just think pushing more will not be helpful enough to notice.
@_date: 2011-06-03 18:43:00
Go with bitcoin. The ceiling is much higher than the floor is low.
@_date: 2011-06-23 01:41:23
I think it will be right with tradehill.
@_date: 2011-06-01 20:01:39
I explained it to a college friend and while he is interested and loves the idea, he isn't mining or investing yet (he has a Macbook Pro lol).
@_date: 2011-06-22 22:46:44
Where are you going to find a $5 wrench?
@_date: 2011-06-27 12:43:09
The hack hasn't hurt prices at all. It is pretty great. I expected prices to go to single digits.
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:38:54
Yeah, I failed.
@_date: 2011-06-30 14:25:09
I used to, but it slowed Firefox for me. Should I try it again?

They want the .org site to be a more professional looking site. All of the trolls were making the site look like a 2nd grade classroom. I think this is a good move.

@_date: 2011-06-23 17:06:56
I have crossfire enabled on mine and GUI miner stills sees them as 2 cards, so I have 0 performance hit.
@_date: 2011-06-11 13:38:55
No. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 14:04:23
They wrote the wrong title. It should be " Senators are trying to shut down Silk Road. They ignore Bitcoin because they can't shut it down". 
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:23:25
Wat is this? i don't even.
@_date: 2011-06-10 20:23:38

@_date: 2011-06-11 01:43:14
I would get a MSI TF3 or Asus Direct CU II just for the fact of the cooling and overclocking. 6950 isn't the best for mining but all the best ones are out of stock right now.
@_date: 2011-06-03 22:23:54
@_date: 2011-06-03 18:36:53
I think we are getting plenty of exposure. China is catching on and Smartmoney put out an article. Let it grow by itself.
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:20:35
He didn't understand that by mining you are helping confirm the network.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:03:57
Who knows? Hopefully sooner than later. If anyone predicts it correctly, they are just lucky.
@_date: 2011-05-30 16:28:16
I would use Buy.com but I need a couple days until I get some more funds in the bank. I will get back to you as soon as I do. 
@_date: 2011-06-11 19:24:22
Wrong. You can go on block explorer and prove they were sent. 
@_date: 2011-06-11 13:56:50
Bitcoin is much more volatile because the market is still very small.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:21:16
I mean like what did they do? Did they have a huge supply and sell them?
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:16:24
I toe that line carefully.
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:00:30
I probably would have also, but they are available no where.
@_date: 2011-06-07 01:42:35
I'm scaling up, but right now it is very small.
@_date: 2011-05-27 03:08:22
I could see this on Fox News and then the Daily Show tearing Fox apart.

If you are expecting it to be a scam, you wouldn't expect your money back.
If you are expecting it to not be a scam, you would expect your money back.
Do you see the issue here?
@_date: 2011-06-04 14:40:57
Stay in. A minimal risk for a possible huge payoff.

@_date: 2011-06-27 04:33:45
See my reply to the other guy.
@_date: 2011-06-03 06:15:30
He has no idea what he is talking about. He thinks mining is a lottery.
@_date: 2011-07-14 16:15:51
It has gone from less than $1 to $14 in less than a year. If it hits $.50, then you can say its dying.
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:18:22
ok i see what you're saying. I was pointing out the fact that if those ways are legal why can't bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-06-02 00:15:47
No but you can post it as a auction and have people post bids manually. 
@_date: 2011-06-04 15:06:15
That is a great idea. I've thought about this quite a bit. Or if the original investment was small enough to not make a large difference, don't sell any.
@_date: 2011-06-04 14:05:30
You sent $48 bucks to this guy? Sen me some free money too, because you're not getting it back.
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:03:58
By raid, I mean the DEA is trying to shut it down.
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:21:01
They should rewrite the story lol.
@_date: 2011-06-09 00:31:08
I adjust to daily prices. I like to do it on the fly. :) Cool idea though.
@_date: 2011-06-17 05:37:33
Why the fuck should I (or really anyone) care?
@_date: 2011-06-21 00:02:28
i'm directing it to kevin if he reads this
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:22:39
I'm saying they could do this (speculatory). It would be a great step for Google and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-11 20:14:46
Actually we aren't sure if they do or not.
@_date: 2011-08-02 03:37:06
I see almost all governments being threatened by bitcoin. I think if one country could successfully minimize it's usage, others would follow suit.
@_date: 2011-05-25 19:08:01
It is actually way slower. lol
@_date: 2011-06-10 04:50:39
Yeah (closer to 19), I should be able to make a stable $30+ a day at least for a while.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:51:43
But they would be wrong.
@_date: 2011-07-17 17:36:50
This would make them easier to redeem, defeating the point of rebates.
@_date: 2011-06-07 01:43:32
Thanks for being honest. I appreciate it. I wasn't trying to attack; this would be good for noobs with can't figure out to setup a miner.
@_date: 2011-06-06 14:13:46
It is skewed to intelligent people. People that can figure out how to set these systems up. I have no issues with intelligent people getting the wealth. And Satoshi deserves a good sum for creating such a great system.
@_date: 2011-07-21 22:24:54
I thought the report was pretty fair. The intro with the guy was teriible, but Felicia did some good reporting.
@_date: 2011-07-21 22:20:55
Blame? I would say credit.
@_date: 2011-06-02 00:13:51
I think you've confused quanity and price. 
@_date: 2011-07-09 04:09:14
@_date: 2011-07-09 08:01:29
So this basically means nothing?
@_date: 2011-06-22 14:00:58
No, if I lost anything, it was only 3.5 BTC.  I don't like him because he is trying to keep stolen property.

So what is the point?
@_date: 2011-05-27 01:39:05
this sucks for mining
@_date: 2011-05-29 03:31:56
Possibly, but I think there is nothing wrong with increasing Bitcoin liquidity for the time being.
@_date: 2011-06-02 12:42:47
I could never get mine working together.  I ended up selling my 560 Ti and buying a 6950.
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:18:23
1. Send coins to a Google Bitcoin address
2. Pay with NFC. Retailers will trust Google bitcoin transactions to be confirmed at a later time, so instant transactions are possible. And if they want payment in USD instead of bitcoin, Google could change that on the fly.
3. Your Google bitcoin account is credited the payment.
@_date: 2011-06-08 12:53:20
Could go higher to like 100.

Nope, I've got nothing so far.
@_date: 2011-05-29 17:27:11
It is very risky. Gold and silver won't lose their value greatly, where bitcoin could. The payoff if bitcoin gets big is huge though. In the past 14 months, Bitcoin has 1000x it's worth. I say if you are young, go for it. If not, put your money in gold and silver.
@_date: 2011-06-06 16:50:40
It can't?

@_date: 2011-06-04 15:04:46
OK, I see where you are going now.
@_date: 2011-06-04 14:27:23


These statements do not make sense together.
@_date: 2011-06-08 14:37:23
I was wondering what the heck was going on. Thanks for the update. 
@_date: 2011-06-03 17:33:21
Bitcoin has less density that other currency. Therefore, it rises to the top.
@_date: 2011-06-26 22:20:10
Security server side isn't the major issue. Getting a secure auditor is.
@_date: 2011-06-27 03:22:33
You can. It just takes a very long time.

It went to 14 for a while. I think it jumps alot after difficulty jumps.
@_date: 2011-06-26 21:02:22
Maybe. If you go by their story though, SQL or really anything with the coding with their site is secure for now. In their story it had to do with a compromised auditor, not the code of the site.

He is NOT accepting Bitcoins. Tradehill is just taking your bitcoins, selling them, and mailing him a check. You can do this already by yourself. No real revelation here.
@_date: 2011-06-02 12:39:24
The investment into bitcoin is very small (Mine was $10 in a domain name) but the payoff could be huge.
@_date: 2011-07-27 12:49:34
Just buy a couple. Probably cheaper in the end counting electricity.
@_date: 2011-06-01 17:16:15
If you would have bought 120,000, you would be a millionaire.

Not on AnonNews.org = Fake 
Plus that website accepts bitcoins. This is the dumbest fake ever.
@_date: 2011-06-03 23:27:48
I want them to move it over, so I feel like i have more bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-08-05 01:52:47
Gold is much less risky, but Bitcoin has huge upside. If I have $20 million, why risk it? If I have $20, I got nothing to lose.
@_date: 2011-06-02 22:29:22
Not the greatest post for bitcoin. Shooting it down isn't great.
@_date: 2011-07-17 05:59:40
Would be cool. I forgot this idea.
@_date: 2011-06-22 05:17:35
There is no way it is legit. It is probably a program that steals your wallet, or sends all of the hashes to one guy.

lol. He is greedy and wants to keep the stolen coins. If he was "doing a service" he would sent the 643 BTC he withdrew and give them back so that the victims would get them. While he did slow the hacker down, he may or may not be involved with the hacking. Read what he wrote. He is trying to keep stolen property, which is criminal.

The issue with no exchanges is that there are many scammers that would never pay. Exchanges are nice in that they protect both parties.

Why do they want to shutdown bitcoin? I can see why they want to shut down Silk Road, but why the whole thing?
@_date: 2011-06-21 00:16:31

They seem to think programmers are a bunch of idiots. I trust programmers more than economists honestly. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:59:19
They have to be verified. Try getting 100 accounts verified.

There was no way of knowing that was going to happen.

Yeah, go through the Python one first then.

Maybe they spent so much time on security, they have done the interface well. As a programming team, its hard to do everything awesome at once.

Mt Gox goes down again, the blockchain gets hacked (unlikely but could happen), it is overvalued because of media hype. Lots of things could happen.

You have much to learn young padawan. Python is anything but low level.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:19:43
Solid point. I agree with you looking at it in that sense.

Because people want a tshirt with a porn site name on it... -_-
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:23:11
There are client upgrades and changes already. The developers are trying to raise the max block size currently.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:28:28
Or they could raise the minimum buy and sell and only 1 transaction a minute. That would alleviate almost all of the lag issues.
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:59:45
Maybe just will Oauth or something and access your friends list. Not sure why they would shut it down, but I agree that they could.
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:37:05

I disagree. Rising price gets attention, attention gets more merchants. The price is a quicker way to get bitcoin into the mainstream.

I will be posting proof of the donation and the return to a winner. I agree, it is hard to randomly trust me or really anyone, but I think after the first couple of raffles people will be more trustworthy. Participate, I promise that I will come through. I'm also posting all the tickets (through the API) I get to prove that you didn't send it to my personal wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:22:19
I believe it is a percentage of the trade that they get, not a flat fee. So if those small transactions were just combined into larger ones, they wouldn't see a difference in profits. Although I see your point as the bots probably wouldn't trade if they couldn't do the low amount, so then they would see a profit loss.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:28:49
This is what we should be pushing just to show everyone we aren't a bunch of drug dealing and gambling looneys.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:15:37
This needed to happen. They can't keep up with traffic. If they didn't they would be stuck in lag indefinitely.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:10:50
No, MtGox is getting DDOSed. It will jump right back to where it was when they fix it. Same thing happened last week.

Wow. This could send bitcoin to $100+ dollars this summer.

You are stupid. I was a DDOS. I'm guessing you aren't technical enough to know what that even means.

China is in on it. There is no way the price is inflated man.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:01:53
Not DDOS, but bots were flooding the system with .02 and .01 buys and sells. They need to put a limit on how many trade a person can execute in a given time. Honestly, they should stop new accounts until they can deal with the traffic.

I think that is against credit card companies policy. If you charge less for non CC purchases, they will cut your CC service.

They believe most people will standardize on one currency, and they are betting on Bitcoin.

CampBX. Why does no one use it? It is way better than Gox
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:31:52
Honestly, this project looks way better than buttercoin. I'm more comfortable in C too. I just recently finished a section in my Systems Programming course  on multi-threading too. How can I help? I can do web frontend stuff too.

We could just make a Facebook app. If you want to send money to someone, it posts on their wall or a message is sent their money was sent. Then they go to the app to redeem it. You could send like .0001 bitcoins to all your friends and get crazy interest.

Ah, I see the confusion. Low level in CS usually means close to the hardware (Languages like Assembly and C).
Go through [this]( slowly and you will learn so much about programming and Computer Science. Enough to probably destroy the intro class at a university and get an internship.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:01:45
I agree. There is nothing to stop them either, since it's open source. Security would be better too.

Trust me, if you're into programming, that stuff especially data structures and dynamic memory will come in handy alot.

Or you can just do[ this]( . LOL 
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:15:32
But we acknowledge we make mistakes, so we build in error prevention, which is in Bitcoin. I doubt the economists think about how to stop all bad corner cases like a programmer does.

Why does no one use camp BX? They accept Dwolla with no verification. It seems like the easiest US exchange to use.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:03:52
