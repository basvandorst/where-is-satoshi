@_date: 2018-01-31 11:38:01

We’re not selfish we work hard for our money. Why would we give a portion of it to someone else that didn’t?

It is 100% usual this time of year. Look at these 4 charts from the previous 4 years

It’s all about price and buyers/sellers. If there are more sellers than buyers the price goes down. If there is more buyers than sellers the price goes up. If someone wants to buy at 10k but no one is willing to sell at 10k it goes up until someone is willing to sell, say 10.1

The green line isn’t “wherever it suits you” it’s at the “higher lows” which is what determines trends

For that Trent says it is. You clearly don’t know technical analysis

Where are we at?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:51:13
After February bitcoin will hit 20k
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:21:37
Yes shitty drivers and bitcoin on a constant basis will easily lead to stress cigarettes

My buddy did this. And even called me before hand about how excited he was that it dipped so he could get in �� 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:22:20
Really? The only side effect i experienced was really fucked up dreams 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:27:59
Let me buy at 15k and hold as it approaches 5k. Yea right. You are absolutely right. No one who bought above 10k is gonna hold all the way down to 5k unless they were just buying pocket change for shits and giggles

If you bought before September you should be still in the green right? I would reccomend selling your initial investment that way all that’s left in the market is profit. Just a risk management idea since you bought in a little heavier than you should have
