You're missing the point.  If you want to be better than average, than you have to find a way to be better than average. If you don't, then yeah, upward mobility is going to be hard because you're just going to be average, like everyone else.  Lots of people do their jobs well, that's the norm.  Its just not realistic that all those people are going to have upward mobility by just doing their job well.  You have to excel and bring something different to the table.  I'm not sure when people started to think getting a college degree meant that you would have a successful career.  That just qualifies you.  You have to actually bring something to the table that no one else does.

Growing up, my graduating class was always referred to as gen X by everyone..... graduated HS 99..  I'm not sure when or why that switched to Y

So dramatic.  Use your brain and figure out how YOU can navigate your reality to be successful.  What are you in your 20's and you've given up all ready?  I was similarly frustrated in my 20's.  Being a college graduate and Working as a receptionist (HS diploma only required)...  I was in my 30's before I got a job I was proud of.  Figure out how the economy works today and position yourself to succeed.  Its all up to you!!

You should be thankful that you learned about fluctuation.  Assets don't forever go up.  For some reason people didn't believe this in the 00's.  Instead of being bitter, just be glad you learned an important lesson

The dot com bubble was completely different them the housing bubble.  A totally different asset class with totally different causes.
