Lustre, Congratulations. I have an idea, but I can not contact the author of the riddle.

the identifier is not needed) you can easily cope without it — you just need to know the seed words)

Everything is very simple. First read the information about the restoration of the wallet in Google. Judging by your words, you just entered the wrong words (or wrong order). And thus created a new wallet, or hacked someone else with a zero balance.

I also tried the dates of Oscar, I also went through all the films of this director. This hint only misled more. i am lost

Good day) you promised to give a hint. We are looking forward

I am far from seed words. I went through a variety of encryption options, but did not understand why we need Rain Man) I even revised the film with the hope of at least finding something, but it’s pointless. The film was released 1988 12 12 — it also did nothing. If anyone has any ideas, write to me — we can work together)

and I had the same situation) I was already sweating��
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:04:14
what are the ideas?)
@_date: 2018-10-17 05:14:43
Привет) было бы немного проще, если бы в Реддит был встроен переводчик)
@_date: 2018-10-11 00:34:34
I have the same situation)

I was also sure that the dates are hidden in the rows, this is the very first thing that comes to mind. There are more than 30 different dates, but I don’t understand how they are related. I analyzed movies, books and more. While I am working on decoding the method of selection (simple replacement).

yes indeed, I also solve a riddle while creating 5 wallets with zero balance ��
