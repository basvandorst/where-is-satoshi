Thank you.  Your info is very useful and very well explained.  We'll see what happens in the next few months.

Yes, it will crash.  Hopefully after we breach the all time crash Bitcoin will crash to a level higher than the previous crash ($3000).

Clod?  You mean, an idiot?

That was basically an index fund.

Since a hardware wallet costs about $100, my rule is that if the value of my Bitcoin is at least $1000, it justifies the cost of a hardware wallet.  At current levels I would buy one.
If you lose the device you can recover your Bitcoin by entering your seed words into another hardware wallet.  The Bitcoins are on the blockchain.  The hardware wallet stores your private keys, which are generated from your seed words.
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:13:57
That's the story of my Bitcoin life.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:38
Actually, that happened to me too.  I woke up in the middle of the night, saw that the price was low, bought it, and went back to sleep.  When I woke up hours later it was even lower, ha ha.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:24:14
It's Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:28:27
Yes, hopefully that will happen in due time.
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:16:56
And what are these better ways of storing value than Bitcoin?  I want to know.  Gold?
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:44:27
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:41:57
In many cases technology ends up not being used for what it was originally designed for.  So yes, it seems Bitcoin was originally designed to be a currency, and now it's used more and more as a store of value, or digital gold.  What's so wrong about that?
@_date: 2018-08-02 03:24:42
That happens to me \*almost\* every time I buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:37:01
that's actually pretty good
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:56:46
Congratulations.  That's a good amount to have.    Move the decimal point one space to the left from Bitcoin's current price to know the value of your portfolio.
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:07:41
There is r\CryptoTechnology.  I am also subscribed to it.  They don’t allow discussions about price speculation there.  You might like it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:50:53
I saw a big dip on Bitcoin, bought as much as I could afford, and then it dipped more.
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:52:22
I made this version:
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:38:58
In order for Bitcoin to be vulnerable and censored it needs to be centralized.  Hopefully that will never happen.
Bitcoin being decentralized is one of the main reasons I got into Bitcoin to begin with.

1.  Most of the bitcoin which will ever be made has been made already.  That's 18 million out of the 21 million.  If governments have not been buying bitcoins secretly already, the most they can buy right now is the bitcoin in circulation, which I heard is around one million bitcoin.  That's not enough to control it.
2. It would be incredibly expensive for governments, or anybody, to do a 51% attack right now.  As time goes on, mining hardware gets more and more expensive.  It's cheaper, more ethical, and more profitable to just play by the rules and mine the way you are supposed to (just verify the transactions and try to win the prize for adding the next block to the ledger/blockchain).
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:24:43
I have always downloaded Bitcoin Core from r/ instead of r/  Including version 0.16.3.  That's not a problem, right?

Oh my god.  Now I only answer calls from people on my address list because most other calls are from spammers.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:04:38
I do run a full node, primarily to help the network.  However, what will happen when I buy a hardware wallet like the KeepKey?
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:51:12
That's about 0.01 Bitcoin.  That's pretty good.  I'm glad you have skin in the game.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:48:22
The main reason she moved there was because after you live in Puerto Rico for a year you won't pay capital gain taxes on any investments.  Smart girl.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:32:55
No, you cannot move the Bitcoin to any other wallets outside of the exchange until the ACH clears.
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:27:07
You can trade it for other cryptocurrencies immediately and you won't be able to withdraw it to a hardware wallet until the ACH transaction clears (about a week).
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:02:49
Remember, this is only temporary.  It will go down again.  Whether it will go down 80%, 30%, or 10%, I don't know.
I'm just glad I bought a very tiny fraction of a Bitcoin yesterday.
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:14:08
That's why I started buying.  I didn't do proper research on Bitcoin until 2017.  I thought I should've bought it earlier.  Still, since I have been a believer of "do what you can with what you have" for a long time, I started buying it then.
At least I got in on 2017.
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:12:02
We have been US citizens since 1917 (I was born in Puerto Rico).  Puerto Ricans don't pay Federal taxes.  I never paid Federal taxes until I moved to California.
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:05:31
I just bought some Bitcoin.  That means it's going to go even lower.  I'm sorry.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:11:01
The Bitcoin Core team is working on Schnorr Signatures and Taproot, which should greatly increase privacy.  It might be ready as early as next summer.  Take into account that team works very slowly, and rightly so, since they are dealing with billions of dollars of other people's money.
Also, once Bitcoin Core releases that feature, wallets and exchanges will have to start using it.  This will take time.
@_date: 2019-10-12 16:59:04
I don't know which exchanges exist in your country.  Deposit your local currency into your exchange, buy Bitcoin with it, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a wallet where you have the private keys.  If you have less than $8,400 to invest as of now, you will buy a fraction of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:26:32
I just finished reading the book.  It does a very good job explaining Bitcoin in an easy to understand way.  I would recommend it to total beginners.  I appreciate and thank you for all the work you did while researching and writing it.
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:07:57
PlanB said that historically, Bitcoin doesn't break its previous all time high until after the halving.  He helped me to have more realistic expectations about Bitcoin's price.  It seems like you have them too.
@_date: 2019-10-12 15:04:51
yes, you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin

I am gay.  My parents were downright hostile to me when I came out to them.  They wanted to control everything I did until I moved out.  Now I live in the gay capital of the world.
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:06:51
I think this is the Bitcoin Core dialog box.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:25:10
Don't worry, keep buying a little at a time.  You are really almost there.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:05:28
But it has been the most common operating system for decades.  It might eventually be replaced by something else, just like VHS was.
I was just comparing it with Bitcoin, which is the main cryptocurrency, and I expect it to continue to be for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:40:27
That sucks.
We'll keep waiting, I guess.  I have believed for a long time that it's better to know the truth, even if it's not what I wanted to hear.
Thank you for letting us know.
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:17:41
I like it.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:26:08
I just bought some bitcoin.  That means it's going to go further down.  I'm sorry.
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:37:01
Congratulations.  Good job.
That amount of Bitcoin definitely justifies storing it in a KeepKey, Ledge, or Trezor.
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:26:06
No.  That's the beauty of it.  Puerto Ricans have been US Citizens since 1917.

Funny if you understand which movie this is a parody of, who said it, and to whom.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:21:35
One of the best explanations of what Bitcoin is was the first definition I heard: the first decentralized digital currency.
Of course, you then have to understand what "decentralized" and what "digital currency" mean, and the implications of that entire phrase.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:13:08
congratulations 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:39:17
This is probably the last 0.16 release candidate.  It only has one open bug and it's 98% complete.  Peep this:
That page also says this will be the release of Segwit wallet.  Hopefully Segwit will be adopted by more wallets and exchanges since they will be using the Bitcoin Core code as a foundation for their own code.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:58:20
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:04:33
I do that too.  Although I don't check all the characters.  Only about 5 from the beginning and 5 from the end.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:14:36
Me too.  Although I will do what I can.

@_date: 2019-09-19 16:44:33
That was Asuka.
\*I do not know if this will come true or not.\* . I include the link for entertainment purposes only.  I invest in Bitcoin because I believe in its long term potential and in what it's trying to do (become an alternative to government/central bank currencies).
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:29:46
I decided a while back to do what I can with what I have.  I started taking photos of models on location because I didn't have the money to rent a studio.  Years later I bought a white background so I could shoot models at home.  But it ended up happening that I liked taking photos on location more: the photos were more interesting to me.
In the same token, even though I heard of Bitcoin when it first came out (around 2010 or 2011) I didn't research about the technology and what it was trying to accomplish until 2017.  It was very expensive by then, but that's when I started buying Bitcoin.  Now it's even more expensive.  At least I bought something and at least I got started at some point instead of complaining about "could've should've would've".
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:31:18
Many times people end up using a new technology differently than it was originally designed for.  Right now people are using Bitcoin as digital gold.
When I was little people were using a program called dBase for things it was not originally designed for.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:39:39
Compared with banks, yes, Bitcoin development is pretty rapid.  Schnorr is not out yet.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:42:09
The very first thing on that video happens to me.  I wake up in the middle of the night, see we are at a bottom, and buy as much as I can afford.  I go back to sleep.  When I wake up several hours later, Bitcoin is even lower!  I get pissed but I don't sell.

@_date: 2019-09-18 16:25:28
Thank you very much for your comment, drrgrr123.  Nobody has explained to me the different types of wallets and their risks as well as you.  I saved your comment.
The only Bitcoin wallets I ever had have been Bitcoin Core and the KeepKey, so I somewhat knew what to do even thought I didn't completely understand it.
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:56:19
Yes.  It took me a very long time to accumulate enough Bitcoin in order to withdraw it.  I believe it was worth it because I used the experience to learn about how Bitcoin works and how to make transactions.
I no longer use that faucet because there are more efficient and faster ways to get Bitcoin.  For example, I got a second job and use the money from that job to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:08:51
I don't like the fact that privacy is not built into Bitcoin's first layer.
Taproot and Schnorr Signatures are coming, although it will take years for them to be implemented.  Bitcoin's development team moves very slowly, and rightfully so, because they are dealing with billions of dollars of other people's money.
Bitcoin was designed to be transparent, not private.  Being transparent makes corruption way more difficult, and also takes away your privacy.  You can have one or the other.
