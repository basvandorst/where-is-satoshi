I wold agree, the Democrats did kind of steal the whole word, however, language changes over time. If you say liberal in America everyone knows what you mean and when you want to reference liberalism in reference to something like the enlightenment or libertarianism, you would say classical liberal. I’m not happy about it but I’m not going to put my hands over my ears and go “LALALALA” because I don’t like that the Democrats hijacked a term.

Were all slaves to our debt, and our debt is a necessity because mass transit sucks and roads are the only way to move around even slightly efficiently. The transportation market has been completely monopolized by the government and that’s insane.

Yes I’m fully aware. That’s why I said “also.” I’m blaming democrats as well as republicans. You’re responding with “but the republicans do this!!” Even if corporations and small businesses paid the same tax rate, corporations would still lobby for more regulation since small businesses have a harder time complying with them because of scales of economy. There’s no question that small businesses are being stifled but to blame republicans completely for corporations thriving how they do is laughable.

Thanks for answering my questions! You’ve been pleasant.
@_date: 2019-07-03 17:48:31
Not pedantic at all. Government has the ability to tax people that don’t consent. You’re saying we should fill that void with something similar, meanwhile it should be replaced with a bunch of private companies and charities that do everything the government does voluntarily and efficiently. There would be a market for transportation where you would have a bunch of companies competing to get people where they need to go as fast as possible, there would be charities in communities that would help people get back on their feet, the health insurance market would be unregulated and people with pre-existing conditions would join a group buy making it economically feasible for the insurance company to cover them. What you’re calling for here is actual unfettered free market capitalism and I’m with you.
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:32:55
My argument to all of this would be that all of the things you listed can be done better by the free market. We already have private security companies. With our extremely inefficient policing, it wouldn’t be hard to beat what we currently have in both price and quality. No more black kids getting shot for no reason, no more war on drugs because generally people won’t hire security companies that persecute drug users. As for roads, we probably wouldn’t have anything close to our current system. We would have privatized mass transit that could get you anywhere you were going 3x faster at a fraction of the price. Everyone knows that monopolies are bad, and then fail to realize that the government has a monopoly on most of the services they provide. The idea that ONE entity should be in charge of all transportation, and all security is absurd but we’ve been living that way all our lives so it’s not so easy to see. [This]( video does a pretty good job of explaining how your rights would be protected in a free market system.

Honestly I really think the left exemplifies fascism right now more than the right does. The right has its problems, but if you think the left is going to save you from a catastrophic economic collapse I’ve got news for you. It’s happening either way.

@_date: 2019-07-03 18:51:12
Yeah regulation is definitely one of the most pressing questions. How do I make sure the doctor that’s about to cut me open isn’t going to kill me, how do I make sure the food I’m eating at a restaurant isn’t filthy. The way I see this going down would be to have private companies that are aware of what the public finds important in the quality of various goods and services we buy and have a certification process. So instead of FDA approval we’d have Safefood inc. approval, and various other companies doing the same thing. As for global projects, there’s not really a limit to a private companies reach when there’s no governing bodies to draw imaginary lines that businesses can’t contract with its customers across. I’d need a specific example but I don’t see why private firms couldn’t contract and organize on a global level.
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:37:11
Okay but also over regulation from the left makes it extremely difficult for a small business to compete with a Walmart. Without minimum wage laws, a mom and pop grocery store would be much closer to being able to compete with a Walmart.

Your first misunderstanding here is that bitcoin isn’t a “stock”, it is a means of storing and exchanging value. While profiting from an emerging market is a nice and all, that isn’t bitcoins purpose. It’s purpose is to give individuals control over their money instead of the federal reserve, or whoever regulates currency in your land. It will be the global currency and the value will continue on an upward trend until something better comes along, which I don’t believe will happen for the foreseeable future. That is the nature of a deflationary currency, as opposed to inflationary currencies, which describes all fiat currency today. They tend to lose value over time. Now, that article that you read was taking a bitcoin maximalist stance. I could tell you all the reasons on why bitcoin maximalism makes sense but Jimmy Song can do that much better in [this]( video. Hope this all helps!

@_date: 2018-10-06 15:22:26
It’s not that the value would change because of the decimal, the decimal shifts because the value is changing. The effect that you’re seeing is deflation rather than inflation which is, contrary to popular belief, a good thing for a store of value.

Well I mean people aren’t just going to not spend money on entertainment. Might as well spend and continue to buy more. The only way enough people will see bitcoin as a viable replacement for fiat is if they see it being used and popularized. The more you  spend it you’re increasing the chances that the person receiving it is actually using it as a store of value. Then you can sell more fiat for BTC. That cycle is how it’ll populate itself in everyone’s life and that’s when we reach the moon.

Economies have collapsed despite fiat currency playing an important role. I’m not saying people will just willingly switch to bitcoin in masses, I’m saying that people will switch out of necessity. Just look at Venezuela. Their currency was extremely important to them and that didn’t stop it from tanking. As long as the national debt grows and the fed keeps printing money and giving it away for free, the economy WILL collapse. It’s not a question of if, it is a question of when and right now we’re seeing a lot of the same patterns that we saw in 2007-2008.

That all depends on your reason for investing. I personally don’t care about my profits. The only reason I care about the value of bitcoin is because the price and the amount of people willing to transact with it have a positive correlation. I am emotionally and mentally invested in the technology so no matter if I believe the price is going up or down tomorrow, I’ll be investing more because I believe in the long term. I tell this to everyone I talk to about bitcoin and if I can make them feel the same way as I do I don’t see that as a bad thing. This isn’t some stock or mutual fund. This is a completely new asset class that will revolutionize the way we exchange goods and services and I think that in itself is priceless.

And then everyone that’s been waiting for a crash will pour in to buy. Look at orders on GDX that’s just how it works.

Calm down Chandler
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:31:41
I was just commenting on the emphasis. That’s how chandler would say it. Didn’t realize the quote was from another show.

Supply and demand. If there are more people selling than buying, it goes down and if there are more people buying than selling it goes up. Look up box and whisker plot and the go on GDAX and that should give you a better idea.

He sold his house... For bitcoin...

Yeezy taught me
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:02:21
You can buy bitcoin with anything though.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:53:33
Yeah, if you go through my comment history I normally try and engage in actual discussion and spread my ideas in a well thought out manner. Idk what was up with me yesterday, my bad.

Thats not a tax anymore. Taxation is by definition compulsory. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:56:30
I wasn’t taking a position on whether it’s good or bad. I just think it’s silly to say you own property when you really don’t. You rent it from the state. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:31:12
No, we pay taxes and follow building codes on our own property. I feel like I rent my property, not own it. I’d like much more control.
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:21:52
I mean you can use Venmo, Apple Pay or any other money sending service...
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:34:35
Do you know how many people blindly make consumer decisions based on the Kardashians? This is the exact sort of publicity bitcoin needs. People don’t care about economics. They care about what’s popular.

To assume that McDonalds is using fillers, even though we have the technology to break down exactly what's in every parcel of food we eat is willfully ignorant. Also the original assertion was that it had gotten smaller, not that the recipe had changed.

When you’re quoting a lyric? Easy pass
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:44:57
Hey I bought a bunch of your bitcoin right around 10k yesterday, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:29:46
How do they know whether or not thats been traded for goods and services?
@_date: 2018-07-30 02:46:15
Lol so you want adoption to stay low? Bitcoin is still in its very early stages and people see it only as a get rich quick scheme. It’s going to go up and down a lot in the next few years but it will trend upwards. As it gets more adoption, people will see that it’s viable as a currency and stop trying to just get rich off of it.

Bitch I’m living til 120 I’m buying lab grown organs with my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:47:25
That is not the case. They have stayed the same size throughout the years.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:52:56
Lol nah I just was curious and have a source that answers pretty much any question I ask it relatively accurately. Her name is google ❤️
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:46:55
Yup, the end is near. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Prepare yourselves.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:58:21
I said “relatively”. I would argue that relative to pretty much any other source, google is the best means of finding an answer to the widest variety of question. Also prove that the Big Mac has gotten smaller. I can’t find a reliable source that supports that claim. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:42:01
Its never too late. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:34:00
God damn it. Just saw the price for the first time today. Ive been trying to buy all weekend but coinbase won’t fucking verify me. I’m pissed right now.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:08:31
So you’re worried about losing the suuuuper competitive market of ISP’s we have today?
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:47:53
It’s unstable right now because of how new it is and how many new adopters there are. It will be far more stable than any fiat currency eventually.

"wow its cool that ford is making all these cars but it'll suck because only one company is doing it."
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:56:19
But it’s cool because the poor are also getting richer 
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:40:51
You're doing something wrong
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:39:27
Unless they're an anarcho communist.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:13:22
You’re working on the presumption that no one else will do this. Criticizing a pioneer because you’re worried about no competitors coming along is an argument that holds absolutely no water economically. In a free market competition will always follow.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:48:47
That will not happen in the foreseeable future. That's exactly what they're trying to fight when they secure iOS from jailbreaking.
