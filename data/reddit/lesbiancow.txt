From the press release:
"The company, named ‘OB1’, will continue releasing improved versions of the software over the coming months, **and will begin offering services to users on the network."**
I speculate my bold in the quote above will generate fees sometime in the future.

I could not agree more.  
I went up to MIT for the event last weekend and will be back for the meetup at Moska on Monday.  I left last weekend feeling that what is about to happen in the next two years in Cambridge is going to be very powerful.

I am here as well - not a student just a member of the Bitcoin owning public.  I did text a bit and even did a trade at Bitfinex on my tablet but the speakers were excellent.
It will be very interesting to watch this project at MIT develop.  I suspect the math geeks at MIT (and I say that as a math geek myself) will flock to Bitcoin.  They will set up businesses around campus, create new applications, and I would wager that most of them end up owning more Bitcoins than the 100 USD worth they are given.  
The world needs a math based digital currency that is not controlled by a central authority and the smartest among us are figuring it out first.  I think this will be an entire new community of adopters and they will spread adoption to their peers at other universities.
While the price relative to the USD may fluctuate wildly due to the early stage we are in, I do believe that as adoption continues to grow price will surely follow.
