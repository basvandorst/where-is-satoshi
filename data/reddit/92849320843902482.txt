I wont donate until they change their shitty name to something less nerdy

This is very true which is why I am super interested in what will change the tide of public opinion on cryptocurrencies.
For nerds it was the technicals
For young nerds it was dogecoin
For everyone else it is????

very interesting. 
this new internet economy is very fascinating. i got a brief brush with it in 2009 back when it was all about spam emails and ppc/ppv ads

Yes, humans are pretty strange... the same amount of doubt they have over bitcoin isn't shown towards regular banking, credit cards, etc when its all basically the same.

I'm still a little fuzzy on how the virus would know that it was dealing with bitcoin specific data.. i mean its just sitting on his computer watching him do stuff... how does it know what the relevant data is
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:39:47
Well what do you think happened to this users coins?
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:22:17
After doing research i'm pretty sure he created a brainwallet
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:31:04
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:36:18
Probably more secure than that.... I think what this user did was create a brainwallet with an easy to guess password which is like putting your money in someone elses mailbox and expecting it not to be taken.

Can you show the transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:42:44
Yea, i think if Bitcoin were just an app or a website, and money wasn't involved, it would already have hit critical mass
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:16:55
The main problem here is that you are trying to explain Bitcoin to people in order to get them to use it. This is the wrong vector of attack.
This would be similar to explaining HTTP to people in order to get them to use Facebook or Google.
Instead, wait for killer apps to be developed for Bitcoin. The possibilities are already there, they just require more adoption by businesses and organizations.

yeah if it is long enough it should be very secure, but the problem is that 'random' mashing by the human brain is actually pretty nonrandom... if I try and mash it would have some sort of pattern like
Im sure some nerd out there has a huge text file full of possible 'mashwords'

my bad, thats when i take my upvote botnet offline. i use it to make bitcoin look more legitimate than it really is
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:09:48
write down the private key on a piece of paper
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:20:32
Honestly that looks quite strange, the coins were taken seconds after they were deposited which to me sounds like something that would happen only if a script already had that address loaded in its 'watch these and steal coins if they arrive' list.
Either it is because the private key is from an insecure brainwallet, or wherever you made the wallet is compromised.
care to have a discussion on this?
Also I have to ask why you would send 18  bitcoins to a kryptokit wallet?
edit: ok so i just read the post you made yesterday
your private key must have been really bad... by private key you do mean a simple password right? I doubt they would allow you to ented the hex value that makes up a real private key
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:04:07
I've been doing research into this myself since reading this post as I am normally skeptical of basically everything related to bitcoin... it seems legit though.
from a review

ha, no way. my real password is much more secure
no bot would ever try it backwards. got my life savings in there.

This is a problem with the human brain. 
It is probably best just to give the idea of Bitcoin away, but to not force the issue. I think that the average person will have to hear about Bitcoin 3 times from 3 different people in order to develop a real interest in it.
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:46:35
I like your percentages, and had about the same thoughts as well, but if so how were his coins stolen in mere seconds? Maybe i'm not giving enough credit to the attacker but if it were a keylogger ...
unless new keyloggers check every single possible password against a brainwallet..
because i'm guessing it was completely automated
