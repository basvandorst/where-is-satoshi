I've had no problems even with 10k
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:32:28
that's bitpay's problem. not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:37:34

i often wonder what the "average investor" that makes up this subreddit really has as a bitcoin balance. can you even be considered a serious owner if you have less than 1 btc? i mean that's only like 10,000 usd. or do you need 3 btc, 10 btc, 100 btc?
most people can't even fully day trade equities these days with less than 30k

i went from assuming i'd be working until 65, to working until 35 or 40. I haven't thought at all about what i'm going to do or where I'm going to go...but it will be somewhere warm.

no problems with Citi Bank or BMO Harris Bank

the Asians love bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:43:26
I've had no problems either. The problem is probably with the bank, not coinbase.

simplex is just a processor; it's your credit card that is likely the issue. I've used simplex-based merchants quite often lately
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:21
no it isn't; it's just a processor 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:17:54
wrong. go back to r/hillaryclinton

just a processor. it's fine

look at gold prices and gold mining stocks in 2009, 2010, and 2011...i hope bitcoin does the same thing

if you want instant you'll have to pay more. maybe if you weren't poor and had more money this wouldn't be an issue
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:53:09

 and she's running a major investment fund? scary.
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:52:51
when i first started day trading stocks in 2009 I learned alot. I made some mistakes but learned from them. Damned risky though - if I had just bought and held some of those stocks I would have made a lot more money
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:49:04
I mean, it wouldn't hurt. At worst, you'll lose some money. At best, you'll make some
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:00:54
not over yet. that being said, I was almost tempted to sell before the second drop to 7500ish and buy back. wish I would have but I don't regret it ultimately.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:26:48
I missed 11k.... i really enjoyed my time there in 2017, albeit briefly
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:54:57
yeah, it feels like we've been stuck at 8k forever 
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:32:23
200k? not setting your goals very high
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:34:28
but couldn't these banks and hedge funds make more money in a bullish market with futures? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:21:51
I've made a few purchases today
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:37:36
coinbase, coinmama. 
anyone really, just transfer the btc out and into a secure wallet if you are (and should be) worried about security 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:56:32
i ended up selling some in 2018 on the way down at 10k...which is fine because i bought a lot more at 3500 in 2019...but i can't count on luck all the time
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:31:44
since you already did it, sell at some point soon (assuming you have a profit) and pay back that loan. then keep the remaining balance invested.
or else you could be rekt
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:52:32
Kabbalistically interesting
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:49:00
if it was a debit transaction it would be an instant purchase. My bank flagged it as fraud, in which case I had to alert the bank to accept at coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:14:56
IME bmo harris and citi bank allow it. you may have to verify the purchases via their fraud management offices though
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:57:49
i used coinmama once for a 300$ purchase.
something larger than 300$...good luck

I'lll be that guy. 780$ is not a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:35:37
isn't it possible that a lot of "those people" panic sold and lost money, so they won't be the ones buying this time around? but somebody is buying...

I'd be inclined to sell half of 1 BTC at 50K maybe, I'd have to gauge the sentiment at the time tho
