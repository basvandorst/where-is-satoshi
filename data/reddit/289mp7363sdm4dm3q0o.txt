BitFlyer charges so much more than other exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:26:50
I'll stay to bother you.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:59:47
This sub is pure propaganda.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:08:37
Both subs are stupid.
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:49:01
Just want to say I appreciate this sort of thing. I often don't know the context of the discussions, so this is very helpful.

Is this elementary school?
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:08:12
Who's panicking?
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:03:50
Yes, and they say the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:02:51
Not at all, they're a bunch of children too. I'm in these subs to learn, but all that's happening lately is a bunch of elementary school level name calling.

Fuck Donald Trump.

Right, there is no capital gain, so I don't need to report anything? Since coinbase has to turn over user records to the IRS, I'm concerned because all my records will show it that I received lots of BTC and sold it. It doesn't show that I received the BTC from myself.
@_date: 2016-11-12 02:27:58
Because he was blocked at every step... 
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:03:28
I just hope it doesn't have to be specifically from BitFlyer (not that you could really do that). Total rip-off exchange.

@_date: 2017-04-21 02:10:31
I looked around and didn't see any similar threads, and just shot off a quick question. I see a few threads relating just to Bitfinex, but not about discrepancies between other exchanges.

@_date: 2017-04-21 01:43:29
Thanks for your kind and helpful response.

I teach at a university, and most of my students can barely use a computer. They're all about their smartphones of course though.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:21:47
Sell? Now? What a stupid idea. We're just getting started.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:12:05
After it hits 1200 
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:11:34
Should be any day now 
@_date: 2017-05-03 03:25:30
Doesn't that cost you a ton in fees?
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:03:04
And everyone in the LTC sub is expecting everyone to sell all their bitcoin and buy LTC.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:14:33
Go check out that's really all it is. OMG THE FLIPPENING!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:00:42
That's because we pay coffee producers ridiculously low prices while they struggle in extreme poverty.
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:48:54
Would you please stop spamming every single crypto sub with your videos?
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:12:24
It's cool and all, but why anyone would give up any BTC right now is beyond me. Remember the pizza.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:38:38
Well the last one sure was exciting.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:43:22
Why are you asking random people on the internet for investment advice?
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:08:23
So I'm a millionaire?
