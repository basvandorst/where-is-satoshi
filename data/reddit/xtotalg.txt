It’s not the size of the doge. It’s the quality of doge heart. Very steal. Much evil.

I think it can be useful to know how things work. But do you know how your computer works? Or your car? I don’t think you have to understand how things work in order to use them. The more people that buy bitcoin, the more yours is worth. This post feel kinda gate keepy. r/gatekeeping

You listen here. Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general might crash and burn in the next couple years. But with reports like these popping up and crypto showing up in popular culture it is only a matter of time until $2000-$3000 btc will seem amazingly cheap. Invest and hodl.
