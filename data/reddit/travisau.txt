Yeah I think volume is killing them. it's weird though I have had support issues before and they've been super fast.
I expected a delay to be honest but I didn't think a single email reply over a 4-5 day period was too much to ask
Hmm I'm on the hunt for other sites to use now too, will post back any experiences i have :)

err the post about delays is from May 6 moron.  "Posted 13 days ago. May 06, 2017 - 19:59 AEST"  I'd also already fully investigated and knew about the delays that have been happening 
I also already know about the mempool values, wakey wakey...
The BTC backlog has been flaring up repeatedly since January and escalating. That's exactly why this event shouldn't be happening on 16th May 2017 onwards - What you dont understand , is they are paying 122 Satoshi per/bytes when you need much more than that right now to get transactions approved (you need over 200 satoshi/byte or even more lately)
That they've known about this since May 6, haven't fixed their fees, haven't informed customers (I'm a long term customer and had no emails and no replies, nothing), and have not done anything to communicate, that's the major issue here. Fees are way too low, they knew about the congestion, did nothing, now its a big huge mess in their customer base. No responses to support, no posts in their forum, NOTHING. They're meant to respond in 2 hours - not ignore customers for 4 DAYS.
I'm aware of the overall BTC issue, but if you pay higher fees, it will get mined, even now. Go look at the confirmed transcations today. 200satoshi/byte or higher. 
Anyway, nice try newbie, get angry for real reasons next time.
The post is here to HELP people avoid unnecessary issues, not bait staunch wannabe-defenders who twist facts to suit their agenda. you know...like you. :) Interesting you call me an idiot but obviously you didn't even read the mempool pages or look at the average transaction fee paid to get things mined right now (and recently) versus what CoinJar are paying. Did you even notice I mentioned CoinJar are lowballing their fees?
well done, well done. You're the idiot. :)

Yep bingo. They literally underpay the fee dramatically when you use reward points.
Even lately normal transactions they use a low fee. Which is crazy considering the escalating mempool /unconfirmed transaction list, requires exactly the opposite (much higher fees!)
I contacted them initially 2 weeks ago about loyalty points taking a lot longer than normal xfers. Not exactly what you expect from a loyalty program.
It's kinda worse that they acknowledge the fees must be higher, and the mempool issue, and then go on to fail to pay higher fees

You work there right?
They updated their SUPPORT post (which you probably follow/are subscribed to hence you received an email) with info on May 06 that they will try to increase to 200/Satoshi to clear the backlog.
Yet in transactions as recent as May 19, they are paying 122.
Stop replying dude, you're just looking dumber and dumber and more and more like a CoinJar shill account.
