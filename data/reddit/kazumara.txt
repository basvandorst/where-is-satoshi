Ow that google translate hurt my ears but it makes it all the funnier

Wait how do you mean default address, does the service actually claim it's own local IP? Or do you mean that :9332 is the default port and 192.168.1.217 is the IP you used for testing?

They list someone else on the wiki here:  but I don't really know SolidCoin
@_date: 2014-05-21 15:53:05
They wrote encrypted. So it's either someone who has no idea of what he's writing or they really were so stupid. Which is completely believable unfortunately
@_date: 2014-01-15 16:49:16
Why didn't you use loopback then? 127.0.0.1:9332?
Edit: Not trying to put you down, just wondering why it was necessary to use a LAN IP.

You can usually chose to encrypt the filenames too when encrypting the zip, so renaming can be left out. Just maybe don't call the zip wallet.zip \^^
What would you consider robust storage? I mean I have heard that CDs may only bee good for 10 years. Do you happen to know if flash or harddrive storage is more reliable for long term storage?
Edit: removed superfluous question mark
@_date: 2014-01-15 12:11:49
Now that doesn't sound right. A local IP which might not even exist in your LAN. How does that make sense? Maybe it's something he used for testing...

Peercoin and Primecoin were both invented (programmed? made?) by Sunny King. Not much known about him, but he seems like a good guy, genuinly caring about the waste in electricity cryptos are generating on a large scale.

Why not just make an encrypted .zip or something. Would be easy enough right?

I don't really participate here but seriously how can everyone involved continue their crusades day for day, some people censoring stuff, others crying out agaisnt censorship what the fuck is going on with you lot. This constant struggeling is affecting new users more than anything else. Any sane outside person who sees this would take their leave, because obviously the the trenches are to deep already.
I will unsubscribe now and stop lurking because this stuff only makes me angry and is frankly fucking boring. I hope you guys either manage to sort your shit out or someone else comes along to make a cryptocurrency with less infighting.

Honestly, I think nowadays it's hard to find a country where English is not taught widely.
It's definitely mandatory in Germany
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:11:56
I bet you are familiar with the European Language Portfolio. Would you think someone who has a certified level C2 in their second language could potentially translate to their second language?
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:26:14
What do you mean?

DSL, specifically ADSL2+ and VDSL/VDSL2 can get quite fast when your DSLAM isn't too far away. We had 25Mbit/s for a few years.
And the newest DSL standard G.fast is being tested in France I think. It makes sense primarily with FTTC because the copper wires may not exceed 250m, but then it has theoretical speeds of 1Gbit/s synchronous. I don't know what is typically reached but you get the picture

But what does that actually mean you challenge it? You don't believe it and want him to demonstrate?
Sidenote: How did you get Aust**ria**? New Zealand is a neighbour to Aust**ralia** and even then it's still just a neighbour, not part of the same country.
Edit: I think both of the latter countries have a lot of natural resources. I'm sure that at least Australia uses those resources to finance a lot of stuff for its citizens.

I'm not saying those who produce the medication should be forced to provide it free of charge or anything, just that I see it as reasonable when society regulates the maximum allowed profit they make off it, so the price doesn't just go up to whatever. If that is still not affordable then the cost furthermore needs to be partly socialised through insurance or similar means (just because humans watch out for each other).


But medical R&amp;D very much depends on a period of exclusivity granted by patents. Otherwise there is no way to turn a profit on those new products if everyone can immediately copy them. Without that there is no incentive for a private entity to research. Sure I guess we could state fund all medical research and sell the results to all interested players, but I think you and I both agree that such a government backed venture would be less efficient.
I'm all for free market where that makes sense, but I honestly don't quite see it here. At some point humans have to say fuck we're in this together we want an outcome that seems more moral or more useful to us that what the market would trend towards. And so society makes some deals, pharma gets the right of patent protections for some amount of time and in exchange they guarantee to not make excessive demands far beyond what they need to be profitable towards those in need and those in the same insurance system who help bear the cost.
To me overall this seems like a decent way to shape the market without being overly intrusive. But what do I know, I'm not an economist. Maybe there are better theories around that I haven't heard of yet.

He might be trying to get a case. It could be a strategy to get the issue into national news and eventually change the situation to the better somehow. But I don't know how likely that is. He might just be relying on the fact that nobody will care enough

That does not sound like a good idea to me for this field. What if just one company knows how to make medication against a certain disease. That's a natural monopoly and if the disease is a deadly one, then the price elasticity of demand is practically zero. Which means no matter the price they demand consumers will buy it because they need it, people will plunge into debt to pay it.
One example for that is actually Insulin. There is still no generic on the market and it's wildly important for people suffering of diabetes [[Paywalled paper]( that talks about it](
In those cases I see it as a good thing that some outside force is applied on the market, it's better than lots of people having to give up everything in order to save their life. It just seems the regulations in different parts of the world are contradictory and less than ideal today.
