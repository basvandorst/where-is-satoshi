Thanks, im not doing anything ilegal but my family lives in venezuela and for me bitcoin gave me the oportunity to send them money and open me to work as freelance to a lot of clients arround the world, but yeah cashing the btc for me is the hardest part (mainly to use it to pay for rent and other regulated stuff that need the money to be clean). setting aside the way you get the money, u have been really insipartional to make me understand that living on bitcoin isn´t impossible. Thanks for the reply.

you are telling people what to do, telling them why they can/can´t use drugs, who are you, god ? drugs have existed long before states, they prohibited most of them to gain public support, in the process destroying personal freedoms. Alcohol kills thousands on road accidents, destroy entire lifes and drag people to suicide, facts are facts, if you want to see the truth go to a A.A meeting and see with your own eyes.

yeah, more people have died in state caused wars (vietnam, korea, irak, etc) so better look who you are defending.

u just said that you want the gov to punish him harder, so yeah, you are basically saying: im ok with the state controlling every single individual action and desition. Let people choose what they want to get into his/her body. Individuals must have the right to choose.

the fact you get angry shows you have very little infrastructure under your ideas, you are defending the state condem over this provider. You are asking for more punishment, because you can´t tollerate the idea of people choosing.

Did you launder your money ? i mean, could you use your btc to buy a car/house ? or was only useful for limited products/services ? if yes, how did you do that ?

i think you should fight with the same energy the alcohol industry and other industries that sell legal drugs. The guy was a provider, you cant with the magic finger tell people what can/can´t buy for their solely private usage. So instead of blaiming the guy, blame the goverment for brainwashing you, drugs just bother the establishment, drug wars are a circus, some day u will learn that.

so yeah, that's my point. Drugs existed long before states, they prohibited most of them and started fighting them to gain public support, when do we gave the states the right to do it ? i just cannot believe your happiness relies on destroying other people personal freedom so your vision of a utopian society gets more complete, u are disgusting.

thanks, i will try my best. You know once you get your first payment in bitcoin u never want to go back to paypal or traditional banks, its that feeling of freedom, of decentralization. Did your family know about your business while you were doing it or you lied to them ?

my last question, did you developed the website ? or did you use an existing darknet market ? if the first one, did you pay someone to develop it or did you build it yourself ?

Incomplete, my argument is that individuals should be able to choose their personal actions/desitions as long as they dont  interfere with a 3rd party individual rights. I would condem your "right to choose to agree with the gov" the same way i would condem anyone trying to destroy personal freedoms.
