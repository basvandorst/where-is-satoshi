Scary times but i agree 100% with you.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:11:13
Damn,....then why its taking forever to send to ledger tho..
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:04:31
I heard something about a "lighting network", suppose to make it faster and cheaper to use bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:01:09
How long did it took you to transfer from coinbase to GDAX? Im trying to send eth to ledger bt no success....
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:34:13
Yeah ypu can try that, you also can try to find a place to  buy crypto with paypal maybe works...
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:59:15
Im gonna try again..its an ethereum wallet on ledger...safer than a phone ..

@_date: 2018-01-29 13:25:49
What about a VPN to change your location and get some online? Or you could maybe get a cloud mining plan like in genesis mining for example...
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:00:17
Whats your country???
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:55:03
Do you get any benefit from the Belgium goverment?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:02:29
So whats the problem? You can get on binance website?
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:49:27
I want that in a red cap. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:43:23
So when would be able to see if this is succesly implemented?? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:06:53
What about  and spend a bit of money on facebook adds to advertise the campaing? You maybe can make a small one page website on  + create a few crypto wallets/addresses and mention that you recieve any help?... Just as an idea...
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:22:49
Did you tried localbitcoins.com? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:10:55
So once btc gets LN running accepted by everyone...it might kill most of the other crypto coins right?

Exactly, but still, if you wanna laundry money, theres others cryptocurrencies out there.

@_date: 2017-12-28 07:25:58
Do you have the btc plan? Its gettin so long the transfer that i dunno if genesis will keep the contracts alive... Used to have the btc deposit within 4 days..now its 9...:/
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:01:24
So what else do you recommend for buying instant btc/eth?

@_date: 2017-12-10 09:06:07
Im on genesis mining, got the btc plan for 300$ back in august, now ive mined worth of 700$-+. But the thing is:
- As The dificulty goes higher the mining is less / but the price  of btc goes higher so balances out.
- Probably spending the 300$ back in august and hold it wouldve cost more now without the fact of mining.
Dunno if im explaining well but i think its kinda the same, i just tried it to figure it out myself and create...
Got my initial investment back already so im happy :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:34:44
Yeah man, keep your chin up. You had balls to get into this and just got robbed.
Ive been bit more than 6 months into crypto, ive seen some coing going up and down...you have 2 years of crypto experience...you have it man. You know what you dont have to do next time. 
Get a job, pay your debts. And start fresh with the wisdom you got from this experience.

Totally tired of that shit, and people askimg how can they do it, or what type of wallets when you just have to scroll down and find the subjects.. I like /btc but memes, and wannabemillionarie kids are bit out of control
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:28
Yeah localbitcoins could be your option.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:32:58
True, greed.
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:04:40
Yeah i dont know the fees tho, is an example of how it works :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:52:06
The safest for big amounts surely is offline. Paperwallets are free but easy to lose. Best choice would be LEDGER. If u r gonna use it regulary (not hodl) u can get an app on your phone...but most defo secure them offline, u can always lose phones and then wanna killyourself for having all your portfolio on it.
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:03:35
Yeah they have a fee... Lets say u wanna buy 50, they gonna charge u 52 (example)
So if u have 50 to spend, u would have to sellect 48 as amount...

Scammers see the oportunity of making money and they take it, right? Besides using btc to not pay fees, taxes, etc on regular transactions are we, btc users, also scammers to others? (banks &amp; goverments for example?) im just being neutral here. Im sorry for your lost, really sucks to get screwed and i know desesperation make u do crazy things, but what ive learned its that you gotta be well informed and not take rush desitions. Im sure you can make those 240 back with crypto ;)

Can you switch between them later??
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:22:03
7k? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:44:13
Im okay with it.
Transparency, im not doing anything wrong buying btc. Holding or make profit out of it. I dnt want any institution on my back asking me how did i make this money. You know what i mean?
If u invest 1000 and make 3000 and u dont hide it, its okay.
But if you come out of the blue with 4000, might rise some flags (taxes, ilegal business, etc).
Call me paranoid bt it make sense to me haha.
And i havent cashed out. Hodlin for the moment.

12btc! Niceee
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:30:47
Yeah you're right. I bought 2.7k€ in btc bwck then. So i gave mining a try..was 280€ (300usd) the 2.500ghz i think.. I was just giving a try to mining. Eitherway all this is risky buziness but now trust on btc more than evah
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:05:23
To "order" it you mean? I waited 3 months for my ledger...
Have u checked their twitter?

@_date: 2017-11-20 06:18:03
"gave"....with their fees? Its just a psychological /marketing thing....bought 120€ on etherium, fees ware around 5€ + getting 8€ on btc 123€..3€ Whichhhhh imma spend again if i keep using coinbase...��
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:16:23
Maybe when u reach 1k? That would be shit to lose...
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:49:56
Dunno, did u tried google it?
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:30:33

I get your point, and wise point. 
Is good to see that btc is rising to the moon...but we have to be aware that if the rocket (by a-b-c reason) might have dificulties or issues. Lets not cry about it later coz you sold your house for greed. Anybody investing more than 2k should be an adult and act like one in times of bad weather.

Boniiiiiiiiiita shorooooo
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:53:10
Private info? My name? My Address? Coz they aint asking the size of my dick.
I'll google later how to cash out, hopefully i dont have to cash out fiat, im planning to use Bitcoin.
You can buy btc in Localbitcoin" too. Totally incognito ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:26:14
I guess when japan start taxing btc you can just go to another country from the area to cash out? Thailand?

@_date: 2017-11-22 09:39:11
Sorry, get a paper wallet, transfer the funds, make 3 copies, put 1 in a safe...
Mean while: order a ledger nano. 
Once u get it, transfer the btc and voila!
Thats pretty safe
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:11:00
Okay, thanks for he heads up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:08:33

Im in belgium and theres black friday (as starting tomoro thursday) so theres chance
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:49:07
Just get the money and do it yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:27:55
Just get a hard wallet? Way safer for big amounts.

@_date: 2017-11-22 19:52:38
Next time test out with an small amount....or more research about the site?
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:15:37
Coinbase makes it pretty easy!
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:09:12
I dnt like the fees from coinbase, plus if you want to buy lets say 100€ btc you'll get less because of the fees (lets say 94€)

@_date: 2017-11-30 07:53:48
I invested 3k on btc... Now is worth around 7k which means i have a "4k profit" right? I could sell 3k now and i'll be okay... I think the profit is obviously seen when u cover ur investment... I havent sold any because for the first time i feel  comfortable where my money is..with me in a hard wallet and worth something... If i have 1k in my current bank i get a 0.05% revenue x year... Thats just crazy...i get 5$ for having 1000 x year... In 4 months 3k = 7k... Nobody can tell you when to either cash out or stay in. Thats what u gotta figure yourself and for the profit its the same.. Cash out when u feel comfortable. No regrets.
And taxes depends where you are right? Im in belgium atm and its based as "gamblimg" i think so theres no taxes on it...im really not sure but i didnt let go this btc oportunity...
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:10:18
The comments on video hahah
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:21
Just checked on their website they aint doing btc mining atm, bt theres a few more that do the same...just research "cloud mining" you'll find everything ��
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:06:20
Dont use Exodus, the fees are too high!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:36:07

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:07:52

@_date: 2017-11-23 15:07:21
Bitstamp the best i europe.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:34:45
Coinbase and bitstamp. (europe)
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:53:52
Its cloud mining, so u pay once and they mine..they take their cut to pay electricity etc etc.
I had no issues or weird shit wiv them. Got my money back in this 3-4 months and now is giving aprox 10€ every 3 days.. Check em out!
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:08:44
Still coinbase too..
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:29:07
True! I dnt smoke tho, literally burnin money...crypto is a blesssss
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:02:55
There you go!
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:46:56
Even worse, coz when u transfer your btc you gonna have to pay more...i say it for experience.. ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:42:39
The same happen in july/august dip..but that was pre bch fork + china regulations... Dunno what can else drop it now more than scared people cashing out.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:37:42
Ahh insee.. Did u claimed BCG on the ledger too? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:47:55
Yeah makes sense its just im scared i fuck up btc doing it... When u do it on ledger you dnt lose your btc right? Coz i was checking it says "send your btc to your btg address".... Scared to lose itttt
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:24:39
Exactly. Im currently in genesis mining. Started in july and i thought was gonna take me at least 6 months on get the money back....and well, i reached it 2 weeks ago, still mining getting aprox 0.02 every 4 days (coz the transfer fees still high) before was 0.019 every 3 days... Im wondering now where else to cloud mine btc.. Coz is really not much of a hassle
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:02:51
Online its the best/trust
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:25:24
Ye i get it, like when bitcoin cash happen right? My point is im not gonna lose part of my btc claiming the btg right? ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:18:56
Dificulty higher and price of btc going up so it balances out eitherway... I think those "life plan" are just a placebo tho..we know they arent forever..
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:48:02
Look at that...back then was possible to buy 1 btc without seling your organs..
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:13:16
Exodus is bad in my experience, pretty interface bt expensive transactions....
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:48:27
