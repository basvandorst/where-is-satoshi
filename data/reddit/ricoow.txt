Well, thanks to a transatlantic cable you learned something today
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:15:25
Doing the same here, never mentioning numbers of profit, just yes I made some, nothing special.
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:55:24
Post again when you learn how to give constructive feedback. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:08:04
YOU get it's a joke, right? 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:06:30
You bought in December 
@_date: 2018-10-31 14:32:14
Yes, day ends at 95:32. Really weird people
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:22:24
At least it is your cake day. Happy cakeday
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:09:06
ETH going to be a safe bet? 50:50 with LTC? 
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:04:52
And where is the corresponding bull run that belongs to this news? We should at least get 250% for this
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:16:04
Why the fuck is it not useful to buy little bits? If you can't spend more than 200 bucks and you earn 30 bucks with it, you'll be happy as well. 15% profit in a short space of time
Hell I just made a 20% profit in a month worth of trading using 250, I'm happy about that. 
There is a very nice Dutch saying for this: roughly translated: Who doesn't appreciate the small things, isn't worthy of the great things
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:26:15
But saying in general that buying little bits isn't worth it is because you are already stacked is kind of weird . 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:43:48
I agree with you, becoming a millionaire in the next 2-3 years is only possible by investing over 100k, you should only try to make some minor (however 20% in a month isnt really minor but still) profits with the little bits. And be prepared to potentially turn losses.
It just sounded as if you meant to turn people away from investing little bits as if it wasn't profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:13:16
You should make this a business. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:57:19
*makes 40k*
regrets it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:52:14
Only thing I am getting ready is popcorn.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:58:55
I am curious, the Netherlands has a show planned on March 13th on Bitcoin, blockchain and other cryptos. Waiting to see if it is a good talk or just mainstream slander
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:47:04
Mamma mia

You know scamming with ICOs is profitable when governments start doing it
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:45:36
I only upvoted subcomments + vegeta
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:38:07
Provide proof for 200m tx pls
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:38:11
Let's buy a five dollar whitepaper and start scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:09:06
Would having your own node also be profitable? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:01:00
There are a few bars and cabs that accept Gulden. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:15:42
They haven't seen one either mate. For all we know they be liars
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:58:17
Don't know I'm afraid... Not from there but I bought some Gulden a while ago and happened to know that some places accept that over there. Maybe they will accept the mothercoin too 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:07:06
But you are a redditor too, inception 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:32:36
Wasn't vechain already China backed? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:27:42
Actually two leaderboards now
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:42:39
Woo-hoo, took first place on a leader board! 
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:21:54
Lies!
