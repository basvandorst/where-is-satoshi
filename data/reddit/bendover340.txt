It is a paper written for an academic purpose that happens to be published on a blog.

Deflation is simply not advantageous to an economy. A assertion claiming deflation as an advantage is preposterous.

Many of these points aren't particularly valid. For instance, yes prices go down during deflation but so do wages as well as unemployment, which really cancels out the benefit ( some points may carry some weight, I'm not a economist). The biggest problem with deflation is that it shrinks the economy by postponing spending and investment.  Inflation certainly can be a harmful if not controlled. But controlled inflation around 2% is ideal for a number of reasons. Some inflation stimulates investment, which is a good thing.

While I can't disagree with Dr. Paul's arguments, I personally don't see the value of the US dollar plummeting. So I do think you are probably right.

I would say probably not. Bitcoin generally does not covary  much with traditional markets  ( or in other words has a beta close to zero).

Oh wow, that is awesome! I will pm you sometime!

Wash sales apply to  securities.  This likely is doesn't apply in this situation as bitcoin is generally classified as property.

I current hold most of all my holdings in Doge, I thought the exchange rate at 50 satoshi was favorable ( compared to historical price), but apparently I bet wrong. I hold a little LTC, UNO, TRI, Earth and Nyan.  Most of which were gifted to me or I got from faucets.
