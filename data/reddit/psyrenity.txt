Still picking such high quality from the bunch! Keep up the great work and I'll be giving away like you someday ;)

You are insane.

I actually cannot believe how good this guy is at picking suitable recipients :o

Exactly. Szabo is the exact kind of person who would have Billions of dollars and just never spend them. Live a modest life and continue on learning about this strange existence, the thing he was passionate about for decades before he ever became a secret billionaire. 
I hope he is Satoshi, I hope its never confirmed, and I wish Mr Szabo the best, hes a shining example. 
If anyone wants the most solid proof to why he may be Satoshi, here is his blog post on Bitgold from *2008*

Yeah, hes probably Satoshi imo. Hes been writing about "Bitgold" and smart contracts since the 80's. He's the only mind in crypto on par with Vitalik.

I think comparing him to an Ubermench is absolutely fine, but be aware that it might be due to your own bias's toward what the Uberman should be, Szabo is probably close to your ideal vision of yourself, if you see him as among the Ubermench. 
Id happily add him and Vitalik to this ensemble, among many others.

Core devs want it shit because they have patents on pegged sidechains. Lol, only way to make that competitive is co-opt bitcoins brand from within. Which they are succeeding at by the looks of it. Imagine trying to ICO Bitcoin in the current climate :) "Hey guys, we are doing a blockchain that can handle up to 3tx/sec, for as little as $10, hard cap $170B, 10% of that will be lost in fees when sending funds to the ICO, and it will take 6.5 years for all of the funds to reach out wallet, so be patient. By then we will have sidechain solutions where you can keep your funds with centralized entities who use their own ledgers to maintain state, you can trust them though its cool."
Joke, bitcoin running on emotional attachment, ignorance and branding.

look at you smart boys, at least one of you is intelligent enough to have read nick szabos blog. Well done. 
Btw, that painting is a very efficient store of value, not an inefficient bank note. Da Vinci is part of history, and thats never going to change. Id like to see the value of that painting vs inflation over the last few hundred years. 
Now, im not saying Bitcoin isnt going to do well overtime. I'm saying that if I only had $450m today, and I had to put it all on 1 thing, Bitcoin, or that Da Vinci painting. Id put it all on the Da Vinci. Because that painting will probably remain in the top 10 most expensive in the world forever. Im talking in 500 years. Bitcoin may not be around in 500 years. The price uncertainty is waaaay higher than that painting. 
Bitcoiners really getting big heads when they looking at some of humanities most treasured artifacts and pretending like they overvalued, when BTC is in bubble territory and clearly being proped up by USDT.

you guys are hilarious. Look at Eth distribution of wallets here, and understand that the eth in wallets such as Polo is owned by a huge number of people.  Notice how nowhere near 50% is even in the top 25 wallets, Including exchanges. Hard to argue that 50% is in the hands of 15 or 25 people when Vitalik only have himself 1% of Ether supply. And has since given away some of those coins to the foundation.
For your statement to be true, there would have to be 50-100 people with more Ether than Vitalik. He currently only holds about 0.5% of supply. At least use realistic numbers. I used to respect your opinion, you used to give facts Kybar. I have upvoted you many times on Ethtrader. 
 Eth is very decentralized. Eth foundation gets to make decisions because the community trusts them and no issues major enough have arisen enough to justify a split since the DAO. 
Vitalik has made it clear that all forks are fine, and he encourages it. So any team/faction is free to do whatever they want with the eth code. Market can decide. BTC is not taking the same approach to BCH, which is very disheartening. 
Vitalik defends BCH because in his eyes it is a legitimate fork, in the same way he acknowledges all forks as legit. And he is a big blocker. Which tells alot imo. 
Eth foundation has done nothing to lose the faith of the community. If at any point they lose that, that can change very quick. That is decentralized. And Eth nodes are more diversified than BTC nodes, geographically. These are all facts.
