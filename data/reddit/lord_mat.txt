Venezuela had taken off several zeroes from their latest currency so you definitely wouldn't need a wheelbarrow. Anyway, there's the option of US dollars or the fiat of a neighbouring country like Colombia. These will more likely facilitate buying and selling than using Bitcoin.

Silver coins and bars - I'd say these would be the most useful for buying and selling daily items. One ounce and smaller (half, quarter and one-tenth including the Dirham-type of around 3 grams), and junk silver of pre-1965 US coins.
In emergency-type of situations, people will start figuring out how much this or that essential item would be when priced in silver. Or whatever medium.

This is true and a sad fact of real life. It's always the poor and less well-off who will suffer the most. Preparing with Bitcoin, US dollars, gold etc. and having alternative power supplies and also food and water - these require money. Many live on a day to day basis or just a bit more - here and now. They aren't able to allocate for the longer term.
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:51:16
Which is why it's prudent to always have "some" cash stashed away just in case. For at least a week's worth of essential items. More is better of course. 
There's the question of security - of the money being stolen especially, and we certainly must take steps to prevent this. But the key point is this: *Be Prepared*... Anticipate different scenarios and take the right steps while we can.
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:13:16
And that's the whole point of the tweet by Pomp. I often agree with him but definitely not with this one. I too support Bitcoin and cryptos for they provide various alternatives and possibilities. Among others, to prevent confiscation by authorities. 
But in this case of the blackout in Venezuela, Pomp is way off with his claim that Bitcoin would have been the saviour. It wouldn't be anywhere close as compared to having US dollars in creating a willing seller-willing buyer situation.  
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:16:17


Unfortunately that will most likely come about over time. It's the same with the internet of the earlier years when the research and knowledge-based communities were the main users. Even a tech giant, Microsoft, was initially dismissive of the internet, thinking it was just a fad that would gradually disappear. And then they saw there's mega money to be made.
Governments and corporations are generally still dismissive of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies now. But yeah, history will repeat itself. For better or for worse.  
@_date: 2019-03-18 06:03:19
The crash of 2018 will be seen as a good thing for BTC. It's unfortunate that some people had bought at those giddy prices near the peak, and then suffering horrendous losses when converted to fiat. However, the purge and correction over the past 15 months have enabled many of us to stock up more BTC. If one is a believer and had bought at $10,000 then he surely should buy again at this current price.
"Averaging" - I'm sticking with this because it has worked during the good and bad times. That is buying at different price levels, *and also* selling some during sudden spikes.  
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:57:13
Good observations here. If Bitcoin doesn't see significant usage in countries which currencies suffer from hyper-inflation, that's an indication it won't ever replace/be a national currency anywhere. It's been shown time and again that the US$ is the go-to as the medium of exchange in countries where there's some sort of turmoil. 
Sure, "one day" the dollar might crash and become worthless, as some doomsayers have been preaching since years ago. But it certainly isn't in the foreseeable future. The most critical phase in everyone's life in NOW, the present. For people in Venezuela, I'll bet they would much rather have US$ in hand right now than Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-03-30 02:07:38
Yeah, have to say that's a better representation. I strongly believe cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin especially - will become something significant worldwide in the future. With so many smart people working on various projects, and backed by various resources, "something" will appear.
Anyway right now we can only speculate and guess as to how things will pan out. The future is something extremely difficult to predict given the variables. And there are likely a few variables that we aren't even taking into account - seemingly `insignificant' now but will turn into something else over time. These are hopeful times regardless of the bear market price-wise.
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:26:09
Even if one is in a country with more reliable electricity and telecommunication infrastructure, it's prudent to always *Be Prepared*. That is in thinking through possible scenarios of unexpected breakdowns as had happened elsewhere. 
Despite the wide usage of credit and debit cards, online payments etc., it's always good to have a certain amount of cash stashed away. Just imagine the confusion, stress and chaos when the ATMs and POS terminals at supermarkets and shops still don't work after 24 hours. If one has some cash stashed away to last a couple of weeks at least, then he has a huge headstart as compared to those who don't.

This is a country whose people had seen A LOT of hardship over the past hundred years at least. Wars, famine, oppression and widespread poverty. Only in the past several decades have things been better, and by A LOT. In general, the country and people are in the best state ever. 
Yes, the government may be authoritarian by western standards. But it has allowed a lot of freedom too. There are no more worries about wars and famine, and the people are rightly proud about their country's achievements over the past decades. It's definitely not a country that those in and from the west can look look down and be patronising about, as they had in the past. Do you think the people really care too much about this \`Orwellian Cashless Payments' given all the good things that have come into their lives?  
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:44:59
After sending all their life savings, what do they then use to pay for their daily living?
In that situation, having Bitcoin is of extremely little use. As compared to having US$ or even the fiat of neighbouring countries like Colombia. Filthy cash will help Venezuelans in that situation, not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:00:46
Don't exclude the real-life issues. Firstly, the seller of the item or service must want to be paid in Bitcoin. Both parties must have phones that are working. The seller won't part with his item unless he sees at least one confirmation.
Now comes another buyer for the same item/service, and he has US dollars. I'm betting this will result in a willing seller, and the guy with Bitcoin going away empty-handed.
@_date: 2019-03-30 02:25:46
"Choices" - people have this with Bitcoin. If they still insist on keeping their BTC and cryptos (or most of it) at exchanges, despite the risks as shown in various disasters, that's their choice. As with risking their capital in ICOs. If and when they lose money, it's because of the choices they had made. Not because of Bitcoin per se.
But many others handle or use Bitcoin in other ways and methods. This includes as an asset that cannot be confiscated or frozen by the authorities (one needs to also learn how to securely hide it, of course). It could also be an item in one's basket to hedge against inflation or/and turmoil in fiat (which should also include gold and silver). Or whatever else that one thinks is best in protecting HIS interests. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:50:23
It's actually because many people elsewhere, especially in the west, don't know any better. BUT have some feeling of superiority over China and the Chinese, like it was the `good old imperial days' of decades ago or when the population was mostly country bumpkins. Things, particularly the more important ones in life, have changed a lot since then. But many people, despite never having been to China, somehow think they know better.

Your poison is another person's meat. This is among the features of the Bitcoin blockchain, especially the permissionless part - people are free to utilise it for anything and in any way they want. They just need to abide by the consensus rules and don't have to justify how good or crappy their transactions are. And they are paying for the privilege.
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:09:44
In 2025 banks will definitely still be around. No matter how much one hopes that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will turn the world on its head, AND EVEN IF THEY DO, banks will adapt and still have major control on what is "money" in 2025. 
Among other things, the demand for custodial services will remain among governments and corporations especially. And they will still call the shots, not the people. With governments' power to legislate and enforce, especially by force, banks will ensure they will remain relevant. As they have for centuries. Bitcoin certainly has its uses, but it won't change the status quo.
@_date: 2019-03-30 03:48:27


Or even significantly higher than that, depending on the individual's evaluation of how critical it is to move the BTC as fast as possible. The thing is, one has a choice when it comes to the fee. Individuals will act accordingly in pursuing their interests.

I've hedged my bets, and will tweak these depending on my assessment of the developments. If Bitcoin becomes the TCP/IP, others could then utilise its unique features (especially security and widespread acceptance) to build on top of it. Or based on BTC in some form or another. Financial-wise some of these will be the huge winners, not BTC, ala Facebook and Google that utilise TCP/IP. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 06:42:53
Exactly! Many seem to miss the main point here - the difficulty of Venezuelans in earning/having enough "money". Whether this is Bolivar, US$, Bitcoin or gold is secondary. From what I've read, it's not just a matter of electricity and telecommunications disruption but an economy that has become dysfunctional.

I'm a supporter of Bitcoin and cryptos. But this tweet shows someone who's wearing rose-tinted glasses and rather clueless of real-life conditions. if I were in Venezuela, I'd much rather have US dollars, and a certain sum of that in cash. During power outages, I'll bet these will get me through for goods and services that are available. But Bitcoin likely won't cut it in most situations.

Cryptos provide flexibility. And it's just basic prudence and common sense to never put all of one's crypto assets in a single basket.
This may be a bit off-topic but I'm adding it anyway. In addition to what you've already mentioned above, I've added another step as part of my contingency plan to face various events. Something that's much easier to do than with fiat or precious metals. I can't remember 12 words, but am able to with 6. Plus added a BIP39 (or is it 38?) passphrase that's easy enough for _me_ to recall. 
Should there be the need, like strife and chaos where I'd have to flee, most of my cryptos will be moved to the addresses of this set of seed words + passphrase. With the ones on my phone, laptop either deleted. As with any history of these ever existing. Should I be searched, there won't be anything to extort or steal.
Sure, cryptos may not be easy for many. It wasn't for me either when I first started 2 years ago. But I made the effort to learn, including at Reddit etc. And that's the keyword here - "effort".

I'm using the Futures exchange at Binance. Newbie at this, with only a week of experience with it. But my Sell/Short position from less than two days ago has helped to keep my crypto portfolio just a bit below water despite the sharp fall several hours ago.
The one for BTC is simple to use. You can read the FAQ at its website (find "Binance Blog") for more details. Basically it's a Perpetual Contract, without months etc. which makes it more suitable for newbies. 
It offers up to 125x leverage which I feel is too risky (but great for some, I suppose). I'm using 'just' 20x leverage, with adequate Maintenance margin so that my position won't get liquidated in a sudden sharp move. Anyway, the leveraged value is almost the same as the Bitcoin I own. 
Some people use the Futures facility to try make profits. Either through Long or Short positions. With me, it's to protect the value of the BTC I have.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:00:46
It was just that not too long ago. Felt 'low'...when compared to the $13,000 previously :-)
The Futures facility at Binance would have been handy had it been available at that time. Would have provided an option to the dilemma faced by many: sell or wait. Can have both with a Futures position.

If the world sees value in cryptos, then another coin will replace it at the top. Bitcoin may be the first, and it is indeed the clear cut top dog. But Bitcoin isn't the total sum of cryptos. The new Number One will definitely have a lot of value, and the other cryptos will then be assessed according to its value. Just as Bittrex now values coins in BTC, these coins will later be valued in "New Top Dog".
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:43:54
Based on the action over the past few weeks, this is a reasonable prediction.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:44:38
What's wrong with anyone wanting to dethrone BTC? Or does BTC have the God-given right to always be the Number One crypto coin, just because it was the first?
Let anyone and everyone try to dethrone. If BTC is technically solid AND retains the support of a huge chunk of fiat moving into cryptos, the it will remain as Number One. Let the free market decide. Regardless of what others' motives are.
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:55:30
In the not-too-far future, Bitcoin might be like the cellular unit above too - superseded by something that's better. If it fails to recognise what most people want, and do what's needed to remain attractive. 
Bitcoin is sturdy, like this unit. But both are also clunky and much more expensive to use than others. One day people will no longer care about things like highest hashrate and become exasperated by its shortcomings. Once they start to move to something else, the unthinkable will happen - Bitcoin is no longer the top dog in the cryptocurrency world. And once it loses that, there will be no coming back.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:03:47
When *speculating* in cryptos especially (it's not \`investing'), best to be in "unsure" mode all the time. With one foot out the door and ready to flee. When we are so sure and confident this or that will happen, it will likely lead to a disaster. Especially when we have our ego entrenched in the speculation, i.e. with a rigid "I'm definitely right and you're wrong" mindset. That means we won't have the humility and sense to take corrective action whenever we are wrong.
In crypto, we will be wrong fairly often with our predictions on whether the coin or market will go up or down. But that's fine - regardless of what kind of analysis one uses, and how long he has been into this, at the end of the day all of us are just making intelligent *guesses*. If we have humility and willing to accept we are wrong, we are then free to do what is better.

No one is perfect nor infallible. Satoshi had made a great contribution by putting things together and coming up with Bitcoin.

I said it - the program - was discarded when others arrived. It's true these were likely inspired by ICQ which had been the trailblazer (while it in turn had been inspired by the likes of mIRC). Regardless of the part played, ICQ the program is long since forgotten.
And back to Bitcoin - like ICQ, it's also a trailblazer. Hundreds and thousands of projects have been inspired by it, and this will continue. But we can't deny the possibility that over time something else might supersede it. Might be years and decades in the future. And then it will become like ICQ. Not totally forgotten, of course, but no longer important as now.

Yea. I believe it might go to around $5,200 again but won't be able to hold this (and trapping buyers at this level). I feel it will have to establish a new support level first. Only after that will we see the real thing.

Yup, unfortunately it's very difficult. It is strongly suspected that many exchanges put out fake volumes because they have a lot to gain, with no repercussions. Like having to answer to tax authorities. 
Compare the volumes at CoinMarketCap (CMC) with the ones here at  [  (OMC). Such huge differences! The latter may be very conservative but I believe the volumes here are more likely. And based on OMC's figures, I strongly believe Binance is indeed the biggest. Most of us here likely have an account with it, and use this exchange more often (and involving more value) than others.

This is generally how I see it too. Especially in the "something better" part. There are so many smart people working on various projects, and backed by critical resources.

You didn't send that but "the equivalent of $100 USD in Bitcoin". If both parties are willing, then all well and fine. But it's NOT the same as $100 USD being received. For one thing he can't use it in lieu of USD - he'd need to sell it for this particular fiat first. 
But you do agree it's NOT an investment?

@_date: 2019-04-04 12:35:14
Yup, that's the thing with BCH - sure, the big blocks help to carry many times more on-chain transactions. BUT the block times are about the same as BTC. Even with small transactions, there are sure to be those who will try to game the system by reversing these. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:06:08
That may be the case. During moments like this, i.e. the past couple of days of exuberant action in the market, people tend not to think about the dismal days of drops. They only focus on what's up - $6,000 with some already dreaming about the magical $10k. 
Well, it won't be a straight line. Despite the months of bear market, I believe we haven't reached the capitulation level yet. One more dump to below $4k should shake things out, and create the situation where only strong holders remain. Only then could the next bull market begin. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:57:50
Although I suspect we'll see a dump first after this, that doesn't mean I'm selling all my BTC at $5.2k or thereabouts :-) Must always have contingency plans for when I could be wrong (which I've been many times). I'm sticking with my strategy of averaging - selling at different levels when it goes up. But never selling all, in case it goes up some more. Should that happen, at least I can console myself with the fact that I still have some BTC left.

And Third Uncles, Aunts and the neighbourhood too. When one is so absorbed in Bitcoin and cryptos (like many of us are), it's easy to lose sight of others. Crypto supporters tend to think others are like them too. Or "should be". That's presumptuous, and a grievous assumption too - "other people" have their own specific interests. They don't care (or understand) about things like hashrate, decentralised etc. But they do care about legal recourse should something go wrong. Like it or not, most will go for something that's supported and backed by governments and institutions.

My thoughts too. A sudden dump is likely based on what had happened several times in the past. I'm with the camp that thinks BTC will test its low one more time. During this stage, the last of the weak/weaker holders will declare "I give up. So tired of this. I'm out!"
If the support holds, that will further encourage others. They will buy more and the price goes to the resistance again. But this time it breaks through and stays up.

This "Bitcoin believers" - how many are there and, more importantly, how much value do they hold? No one knows.

There certainly had been diehard ICQ loyalists too who had insisted on using this program alone when other Instant Messenger programs came out. Until one day they realise it's time to move on.
The thing is, people will look after their interests first and foremost. That includes with Bitcoin too, no exception. If they feel that something else in the future is better for them, and they can see it is superseding Bitcoin, they will move to it. A few bitter diehards will surely hold out and refuse to accept the new status quo. But eventually they too will quietly move over. Because they grudgingly accept it's in their interest to do so.

How do you know about this `majority'? For instance, how many they are and what their average buying prices were? Regardless of how many seconds, there surely had been sellers AND buyers at this price. 
And how about the level that's a bit lower, say $16,000 and thereabouts - A LOT of value in fiat went into those units. Try talking "Bitcoin's store of value" with them.

This is the guy who had gone all-in at the \`solid proven support' of $6,000. Then went into a coma and admitted to intensive care at the end of last November. Glad to see he's still alive and at least able to stand up.

Bitcoin isn't like the internet. Unlike the latter, Bitcoin can be superseded and replaced by something better.

That's a prudent thing to do, i.e. educating ourselves on that. In some (many?) countries, profits from cryptos aren't taxable. Lucky for them! That's because their relevant authorities haven't even made a stance on what Bitcoin and cryptos are - whether commodities, currencies or assets. Only after these are defined could taxes be imposed.

Coinmama most likely don't really care. But to appease the government, they are picking on a few users and placing them under a microscope. To be used as evidence they are all prim and proper when it comes to their users not breaking the law. OP happens to be one of those who were unfortunately picked as fodder to appease the government.

Exchanges conveniently ignore this and keep charging 0.0005 BTC for each withdrawal.
@_date: 2019-09-26 04:59:44
What's the problem with that? Trading cryptos is almost the same as with other markets. One needs to keep track and records, and make the proper filings.

It's true that governments tend to be hostile towards things they can't control or have significant influence over. With cryptos, I believe it's due to them not being able to get a cut of the action. And not so much about money-laundering, funding for terrorism. If there's a mechanism for them to tax, they become more tolerant. 
By the way, with taxes, we do our best. If there are ways to legally get around etc., then do that. Based on experience and observation, the government is often happy when it gets "something" and thereby leaving you alone. And going after those who try to evade. 'Legal extortion', yes. But that's how it is.

For those who do, most don't have any idea on how to buy this.
But gold... Even the illiterate is comfortable with it. Something with a track record covering thousands of years.

Number 3: I'd say the Bakkt factor was already priced in well before it finally happened. And when it comes to derivatives, there's also the short selling to contend with.
When the price slipped below widely watched and followed support levels, stops were triggered. It pushed the price further down resulting in a cascade of sell orders.
Now most everyone is waiting to see support established first before doing anything.

Cheaper, yes. But it can always go down another 50%.

Had started with Bittrex. But since early 2018, it's mainly with Binance. I also use Poloniex, Huobi and Kucoin but not often.

I bought the dips...AND ALSO sold when it spiked.

If you had actually followed him through his social media like YouTube channel, he DOESN'T know how to get headlines. It's others who create these headlines on their own initiative and time.
How do these come about? Due to the content of what he says and writes about which are always open to scrutiny, challenges and debate. Including and especially by those well-versed in the confluence of technology, finance and socio-politics. 
Try watching some of his videos - you will surely learn something.

And some more a few months ago at $13,500

I prefer reputable escrow services like Localbitcoins.com, Remitano.com and similar. And  immediately getting the coins off the escrow service to my own wallet.
Averaging has worked well enough for me. That is, making separate buys over time and not one big buy. In retrospect, the recent prolonged bear market was also helpful if one had taken advantage of it. Bitcoin was for the taking at $3,300 or so just 5 months ago.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:57:36
Often enough and 99% sure A LOT more than the value of yours ever.
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:40:26
Dollar is "a shit asset" *and* "with no future". I presume you're also insisting "...while Bitcoin is the opposite"?
You need to get out of the hole you're in and have a look around.

Plus to hedge against the possibility of things suddenly turning. Which is quite frequent in the crypto market. It's always a good thing to take some profits when they come. This ensures smooth cash flow.

A bit off-topic: This face says a lot. If you were to put a red nose to this guy, he'd make the archetypal clown we often see in circuses and movies. And based on his points about Bitcoin, this guy is a natural!

In case of financial collapse, I'd much rather have gold and silver than bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:39:54
I've decided to lock in some profits just in case. It might go up some more but that's fine. Because I didn't sell all. I'm trying to avoid feeling regretful should the market suddenly correct. With cryptos, that's always possible.
Anyway, can always buy again later, albeit at a higher price if the rally continues.
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:42:24
And many are now regretting and lamenting with that "If only I had (fill in)..."
Bitcoin was there for the taking at $3,300 five months ago. Those who averaged their buys - and kept to this strategy - would have bought some at around here. And at slightly higher when it crept upward. Ignoring all those _anal_ysts with their charts and lines who insist BTC was going lower still.
With Bitcoin, averaging our buy prices works. Plus remembering to also sell some when there are sudden spikes. This ensures we always have smooth cash flow, and able to buy again when others panic sell.

I've just accepted dollars for some BTC an hour ago at $6,900. Part of the units bought over different price levels. Including near the bottom of mid-December last year.
Why am I accepting dollars over BTC? Because I can use the profits to buy things. And have the capital at the sidelines, to provide options in changing market conditions.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:28:13
Yup, it's often that - regret not buying, regret not selling, regret not buying more etc. No matter how hard I try, can never get it perfect.
Oh, once in a while I might...buying at a certain price and it suddenly goes up significantly. After taking profit, it immediately stumbles. But usually it tends to be murky. 
One thing that has worked reasonably well for me - averaging the price. In buying and also selling.
