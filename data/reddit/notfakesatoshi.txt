I don't think you understand what he means by "native currency".
The internet is decentralized, permissionless, and open. Credit cards are not.

I hate bcash, but on some level I feel kind of bad for the guy. I think he truly believes he's doing the right thing for Bitcoin.

I think is more excited about "OVER 9,000" than they will be about 10,000.

It would make a lot more sense to steal lower profile coins than Satoshi's.

In the short term the price would drop significantly.
In the long term, if the coins were mostly divested then I think it would pave the way for even higher prices as it eliminates the possibility that BTC is massively funding some authoritarian regime.
If he just moves a bit then comes out and proves he’s Kim Jong Un or something, well, goodbye Bitcoin (or fork to blacklist his coins)

I refuse to believe the dude went from humble genius with near perfect opsec to flaunting lambos and hanging out with sketchy billionaires.

Pshh, anyone well-versed in Bitcoin should know that the genesis block reward is unspendable.

That would be epic, though it’s a scary amount of power for one person/entity to have. He could single handedly destroy every fork (and probably Bitcoin itself)
