coinbase charges 10 dollars if you want to send bitcoin to anyone idc about the little 2 dollar fees but i wanted to transfer 15 dollars to someone and they wanted a 10 dollar transaction fee
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:59:20

98% chance of not getting audited. The income you were reporting was so small compared to what a lot of people report who do super crooked shit all the time.
They rarely get audited. You aren't even a blip on the radar. Only way you would would be if you were just an unlucky person the IRS audits each year.
Source: multiple members of my family are accountants and I do taxes a little bit in the winter for extra money.
Why are you asking this now though? Did you file late?

Using banks abroad is usually a sign that your involved in some kind of criminal activity (tax evasion is the most common) I mean why the hell would you put your money overseas unless you don't want your country to know how much money you actually have? Lots of famous people and drug kingpins are notorious for this I doubt this guy is into that but he probably doesn't wanna pay what he owes to the government lol don't feel too bad for him if he has money like that.

I hear you im the same way bro
@_date: 2018-08-01 04:52:22
What did you buy in at? please don't tell me anything 5 figures. Either way hold onto it, watch the prices and accumulate fiat money in the meantime so that way when bitcoin does pop off again you'll have other money to your name and out of nowhere make more worst case scenario you lose some money but i would hold.

Coinbase sucks out of all the bitcoin exchanges they charge so much more money and they sell it to you for more than bitcoin is worth and buy it from you for less than it's worth then on top of it they whack you with a ridiculous fee. I remember I wanted to use 20 dollars worth of bitcoin but after all the fees it was like 35 dollars of real money..... horrible company

Wrong subreddit
I think r/trashy is more appropriate

Business and family don't mix.
Bad idea.

I hear what you're saying man, I signed his petition a long time ago.
I'm just saying the real reason he's doing life is because he was the FIRST person to make a website like that. The government wants to use him as an example to say "this is what happens when you create an illegal online marketplace."
He shouldn't be doing anything close to life. People do way worse shit than he did and get small sentences. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:10:28
They made an example out of him. 
That's why he's doing life.
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:24:35
He's probably an FBI informant.
His right hand man, Brian Farrell, got an 8 year sentence. 
Benthall admitted everything when he spoke to agents. There is nothing about a trial or sentence. Usually, that kind of fishiness means they co-operated in ongoing investigations or at least co-operated on taking other people down, aka snitching. He might still be ratting for all we know.
I'm not disagreeing with you at all. I think Ross should have got some time, but nowhere close to double digits or life.
I'm just saying the only reason he got life is because he was the first person to do this and they used him as an example.

If you bought bitcoin and you are just holding on to it dont sweat it yet.
If you earn a profit then that is considered taxable income and you should report it and pay your taxes.
If you sell it for less than what you paid then you should be able to write it off as a loss.

1000,000 should either be:
Or if an extra zero was added

Very nice of you, good luck to everyone hodling.

Thank you I bought on Saturday and still haven't been credited but that may be 3-4 biz days thanks buddy!

Thank you for this my friend.

Kinda what I'm saying homie, he said he was going to sell land to invest that's more than I'd be willing to lose, but I do agree with you and abide by the same rule.
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:02:35
I wouldn't sell land to invest right now, but I would definitely invest a smaller amount but don't sell any assets or anything with a legitimate value-your land will not depreciate but bitcoin swings like crazy. Then again it's your money do as you please, just know you could get very rich....or very poor.

I don't have alot but I have a small investment in bitcoin, I've made money on it and I've lost money but my earnings pretty much make my losses null, I don't plan on getting rich, but even Robert Herjavec (shark on shark tank, owns the  global cyber security firm, and he grew up working on a farm in communist yugoslavia!) Even says the price of bitcoin will spike again, i would take his word over ops, but at the same time I wouldn't invest serious money, I see bitcoin as a very cool and discreet way to use money, I also like the fact that it's digital so it's  much harder to hack a bitcoin wallet than it is to encounter a stick up boy and get got.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:17:48
That sucks friend. I don't know if mycelium wallet is a scam but personally I really like Gemini it's an exchange and wallet without coinbase's draconian fees or rules, but maybe it's just an error? I've had times with misc. Wallets/exchanges when nothing has shown up so it could be an error, contact support if they have any support if they don't it might be a scam but hey worst case scenario at least your only out 27 dollars nothing crazy. Good luck though.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:44:54
I've run my own business and op is right there is no guarantee in business... If you want to actually make money the real stock market is probably a safer choice. (Inflation people) 
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:43:40
Kinda what I'm saying homie, he said he was going to sell land to invest,which means he's probably thinking about investing A LOT, so, taking that into consideration, that's more than I'd be willing to lose, but I do agree with you and abide by the same rule.
