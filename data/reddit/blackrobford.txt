Please tell me this isn't one of the people who supported the government shutdown. That would be very very unfortunate

Starting to use rhetoric are we? I like it. Rhetoric is absurdly powerful, just look at the whole "Death tax" issues that came around. Lets do this more.

If you have several thousand coins then you can spare the money for an offline laptop (as in never connect to the internet) .
With this offline laptop you can either store them using electrum or make a paper wallet. The only problem with electrum is that in the unlikely chances your harddrive fails then your screwed. I would recommend generating multiple paper wallets and then storing them in a security box at the bank. They cost like $15 a year, feel free to Bip38 encrypt them but just make it so that in the unlikly chance you die that someone else knows the password and able to access the coins.

I would like to point out that there is a good chance a significant amount of these huge wallets are probably back from 2009 when bitcoin was first launched and most of the assists in them are likely gone forever. I wouldn't be surprised if 25% of all coins ever mined are lost forever due to computers failure, lost passwords in BIP38 encryption or even just straight up forgotten about by the owner and they threw the computer away.

You just scared the living shit out of me.
For some reason when I first quickly read this I read "Firefox" instead of Safari for some reason. I had a slight panic attack because I created BIP38 encrypted paper wallets using Firefox and placed the fruits of my past 5 summers working at a local golf course in these wallets (I'm 17). On closer inspection I found out that my brain was fucking with me and made me read Firefox instead of Safari and had the biggest sigh of relief I have ever had. 
Good catch. Thanks for the adrenaline rush too, it feels awesome.

If bitcoin is comparable to the internet then I would say we are around 1993 right now if that makes any sense to you. 
So to answer your question yes, I do believe anyone who is in bitcoin right now could loosely be called an early adopter. Few people still know what bitcoin is and a fair majority of those who do believe it is obsolete or a ponzi scheme.

Out of curiosity how much does he take for his own compensation? Isn't like 20%? Non the less still a solid deal for you.

This is my mistake, that hyper inflation was ment to be *hyperdeflation*. 
The point I was trying to address was that while in the short term the deflation is good for us investors but extremely extremely bad for the currency as a whole. Why the hell should I spend any BTC today when its almost certainly going to be worth more tomorrow. What happens if bitcoin is widely adopted and because no more bitcoins can be produced that shit hits the fan hard and absolutely no one spends any of their bitcoins? It seems to be a glaring fault in the system that no one likes to talk about.

As a 17 year old in the US I was able to buy Bitcoins through coinbase. I had no troubles along the way even though my bank account is in my name. All I had to do was get like my routing number and other information through my parents. I was actually quite surprised I could do that.

lose money? No.
 
lose value? Yes
You are not a fortune teller, no one knows where the market will be in the next year, theres a chance the price could settle at $30. No one knows
This is a good post about your *opinion*, nothing factual though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:45:35
This depends on your point of view. When I bought in at $296 I told myself I will not touch any of these coins until I graduate college (In 5 and 1/2 years), even then I wont be cashing them out I will be spending them. So then with your logic I will have neither obtained profit or loss profit because I never sold. 
So yes, that is a fact but it depends on your viewpoint.

No where, thats what Bitcoin is about. Its decentralized and anonymous, naming a place the "Capital of bitcoin" is slightly contradictory to this. While there can be places that are viewed as the early adopters of Bitcoin in my opinion no single place should be named the "capital".

This is actually a REALLY good idea, my only concern would be if it gets scratched and unreadable. OP should offer this
