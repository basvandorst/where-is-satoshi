Lol I didn't even notice til you pointed that out. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:25:38
I'll work on it.

Top shelf feedback. Thanks.

Buy buy buy. There is never a bad time to buy bitcoin...

Bitcoin is better than gold as a store of value in every conceivable way.

its clickbait for my target audience, you should watch the video.
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:46:23
Congratulations. This has got to be a great feeling. The first time you get to use crypto (particularly bitcoin) for its intended purpose of uncensorable p2p money, it is a pretty awesome feeling. 
Just transacting with people for services online will help open up your eyes to the possibilities of this. No more banks. No more frozen credit cards. No more daily withdrawal limits. 
Sovereignty over *your* wealth feels good.

This is an excellent book if you like austrian economics.

Why the personal attack?
You would probably like my video if you watched it.
 At least then we could talk about the content instead of ...whatever this conversation is.

This guy gets it. Most won't get it until they learn the hard way.

The difference is that the halving isn't a hype event. It's a tangible supply shock.

Hold your own private keys

Custody and security in bitcoin is...complicated. there probably isnt a perfect answer.
 ideally you would be storing your own private keys on a device with plenty of code review like a trezor or a cold card, and those are never going to be 100% safe but they certainly are much safer than storing your keys on computer or an exchange. Trezor being more beginner friendly but cold card probably being more secure. 
For larger amounts, just that probably wouldn't be enough. You'd want to be running your own full node and verifying your UTXOs against your own personally synced copy of the blockchain. You might look into multisig or timelock or custom built hardware at that point.

Generally speaking yeah. Though certain exchanges will have better order flow...and maybe be less likely to leak your info

Uh huh. All markets are totally efficient and all knowledge is symmetrically dispersed. Give me a break.

I'd assume a good many of his followers have read end the fed which has tons of sources that go deeply into the history of money if you dig through them. The fact that people who understand the history of money as a majority prefer bitcoin over gold is a positive sign.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:25:28
Dont think the commentor is talking about trading between currencies but rather the change in purchasing power of a held currency. Ex: you dont pay taxes when USD gets strong against the Yen, so why do you pay taxes when BTC gets stronger against USD if you're only holding it. I could choose to get paid in BTC pay my income tax and then see appreciation in purchasing power but that would be a taxable gain under current regulation. Not so with USD (granted purchasing power appreciation is far more limited than BTC).
I know why it works this way, but I think that's what the previous guy was getting at.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:21:58
I think the difference implied here is between trading different foreign currencies versus holding and spending something like USD. Appreciation in the purchasing power of held USD is not a taxable event. I think that's what the previous commenter was getting at.

Ballet crypto is still a shit product. Be careful of charlatans.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:34:06
I'm okay with it being increasingly popular amongst the libertarian types who follow ron paul and have read up on the history of money (end the fed, creature from jekyll island etc). 
Many of the old school libertarians are entrenched in the "if it's not gold its no good" mindset. For bitcoiners these are some of our harshest critics. 
I'd say this poll is a positive indicator of sentiment for bitcoin amongst libertarians. 
Sure this poll isnt a scientific sample size...but I doubt anyone here is trying to pretend that it is.

If you're looking specifically for technology only, you'll be hard pressed to find that. Best thing would be to find a couple good podcasts and tune into the more technology focused episodes. 
Some of my favorites:
[Cryptoconomy]( (he just puts quality articles into an audio book format, you could pick out the more technical readings)
[Noded]( Some episodes are economics heavy but there are many in depth technical discussions
[Stephan Livera]( Again, often economics heavy but many episodes are solely tech focused.  
There are several other good ones if you are looking for more, but this would be a good place to start.

If you started dollar cost averaging at ATH in DEC 2017, [you are currently seeing positive return.](
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:37:04
Yes but there are ways to do it through an LLC where the 3rd party custodian manages it for you legally but your LLC (you in this case) holds the actual private keys

Podcasts and twitter are a great source for those kinds of discussion. Also github, bitcoin optech newsletter, and bitcoin dev mailing list are worth checking regularly. 
Also pretty much anything you can think to ask about bitcoin was already asked and debated ad infinitum on bitcoin talk 8 years ago. 
Quality of reddit discussion in general has been on the downhill for years now imho. Many of the people with interesting insights dont bother with it anymore.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:56:43
If you REALLY only want to hear about tech, just subscribe to the [bitcoin optech newsletter]( and the [bitcoin dev mailing list](

Sure. But a block chain based ID system is a stupid idea.
@_date: 2019-12-11 02:14:08
Blockchain, the time stamp mechanism for preventing double spend helps with that...how exactly?
A distributed database for identification...It sounds great in theory, but you cant have a self soveirgn ID system, unless its for pseudo anonymous social credit. If you want the ID system to be useful for anything at all, there has to be some authority to approve people are who they say they are.
Else every 16 year old can just put their own entry into the database.

Wouldn't that require a money transmitter license. Where as this particular case allows OP to offer bitcoin through an intermediary?

First thought I had when I saw the banana going viral is either money laundering or a marketing gimmick but probably both.
