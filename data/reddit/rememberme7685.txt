Perhaps you didn't read my full comment.

You don't think you live in a democracy or a republic do you?  You live in an oligarchy that pretends to be a democracy.

Windows is about 40 times better than linux as a desktop OS.  Linux is about 50 times better than Windows on the server.
EVERY single time I experiment with linux on the desktop, something isn't quite right.  There just isn't enough money to be made right now for linux on the desktop to work well.
Like I tell everyone a gui on Windows is used for management.  I gui on linux is something you have to manage.

ABSOLUTEY!  I'm really pulling for linux here.  I hope it works.

No problem.  I measure it in boxes installed and problems requiring hours upon hours of research and no resolution.  Obviously I just pulled the numbers out of my ass.
You're likely ok if you get fully supported hardware.  Anything less and you're asking for trouble.  
The absolute truth is Nvidia nor AMD get much revenue for supporting their gpus on linux.  Why should they make the drivers better or help with open source development?  I've only seen promises from them and business doesn't run on promises.
If you have a call center or some standard productivity needs requiring an absolutely known set of applications running on a gui then linux would be fine as long as you maintain strict requirements on the hardware you purchase.  For general desktop/laptop stuff you're just asking for trouble.
Anyhow, this has been my experience and the experience of others I trust to tell the truth and not market.  Take it how you like.

I think that's the joke.

I meant the 1MB block size part.  I don't think Gates knows enough technically to feel comfortable saying anything about the blockchain.

Totally agree.  R1soft by the way?

That's fine if they are.  Most studies show they have a higher iq.  The problem is when they run the banks and give their friends and family more loans than others.  This is intrinsically unfair and essentially evil

Not when they control banking.  Banking should be impartial and fair.  Of course if you like living in a world where one race determines the winners and losers then I guess it suits you.
Since you're fine with ethnocentrism then when the white supremacists wake up the 63% white population in the US and they start agreeing on what is happening, you should be fine with whites kicking the Jews out of the banking system and putting in only European Americans in power positions.  
Ethnocentrism rules huh?
