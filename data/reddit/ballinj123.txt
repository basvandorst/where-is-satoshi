This is a joke right....there has to be a good reason to fucking fork, we all know what happens when you create tons of supply of a currency out of thin air because of greed...
Hopefully everyone will see this crap for what it is and not put any value in it

Ok I'm just going to say it - no one has the balls to short this. Wall St. is more scared of losing $$$ when the optimism is this epic and everyone is saying it's going god knows how high. They either don't dare to short, or will be buying in which case the greed is on our side. If they do collude to short it's only to flush out the weak-kneed ones. They can short the price to shit but your losses are paper if you stick with what you know will be long-term adoption
We have balls of steel forged in HODLFIRE so bring it on

Yes they did, but pretty sure the real estate bubble pop wasn't caused by short sellers, but massive credit overextension and then rising default rates. We have neither here, at least I know of nobody borrowing to buy

"what a ride"? 5%, you're kidding right
The more you stare at the ticker the more you're going to hear voices in your head. Same here, nearly sold a couple times, always glad i didn't

Good thinking. You'd get so many years in jail insider trading (on your own exchange) if it was any other security other than crypto haha.

twas definitely consensual. It was asking to break above 16k for a long time
