I don't think we're at a point where we can clearly define bitcoin other than it is a token to transact on an unprecedented ledger. (2) and (3) will almost certainly be affected to some degree. (1) might only be attainable in the future if on the blockchain, so there's that also.

@_date: 2015-01-15 17:16:42
bitcoin is in a very volatile price dicovery phase. There is no "intrinsic" value per se and its value is pure speculation at this point.  My belief is over time as utility is presented, the value will increase dramatically and rapidly.  Volatility will subside once Bitcoin is determined to be "the thing everyone will use for X and Y and Z and every finacial service and every vote and any need to prove ownership".
Google wallet is a network owned by Google in which the default currency is supplied by a private instution or "corporations."  Bitcoin is owned by its users and its default currency is based on a mathematical algorithm which no one controls.  The reason Bitcoin persists is because more and more people around the world have come to a concensus that this is "a thing to be valued". 
EDIT: Companies like BitPay and Coinbase offer instant transfers back into FIAT at no risk to the merchant.
