@_date: 2014-09-07 18:05:56
You mean like this guy? Yikes... 
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:51:27
This has been verified, yes.

Did you actually read the comments? That tx fell off the network, nothing was lost... yours will confirm, it's just going to take at least 6 more blocks, which could take anywhere from an hour to a few. i'd relax and go do something else for a while, trust me, you won't lose the BTC.  EDIT - i've done this as well, and it took a full overnight to confirm. Why? Because i was cheap and didn't care how long it took! :D

Nick Szabo. 
Guy is clearly brilliant. His bit-gold appears to be the basis of bitcoin imo, but he publicly denies any involvement. Many claim he is indeed SN, however, my digging has found that Mr. Szabo is indeed a living human, not a pseudo-nym, and probably not SN after all... oh well.. so much for language studies.. :S
Edit there is a lot of debate about whether Mr. Szabo was not a pseudonym, however i have pretty much proven that indeed, he is a real guy, and not hiding out or anything, despite his lack of photos on the net.
edit 2 - Hal Finney claims to have met him in a posting on a forum i read. Hal Finney was no liar. 
Edit 3 - Szabo was a cypherpunker, just like Finney, and a lot of others.. interesting stuff if you like conspiracy theories i suppose, but interesting nonetheless, when you read his work then look at BTC etc... 
Cheers and welcome to enlightenment! :D

Hi, did you see this part?  **Estimated Confirmation Time	Within 6 Blocks (Medium Priority)** ... Yes it will take a while, but it will confirm eventually... Just curious, why did you send no tx fee? 
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:34:23
sorry, you said you hadn't seen any at all. anyhow, like i said, believe what you want. it's all good. :D
edit - "Gavin Andresen, one of Bitcoin's core developers, told Business Insider in an email that he had attended the Princeton Bitcoin conference with Szabo in March" source - 
Also, there is this redditor claiming he met him there as well. (Yeah i know, still not good enough, but hey, just saying there is more evidence of him being real than not,  IMO).

i'd love to say the same, but i tried to deposit about 80 USD in btc to my wallet there (it was the *night before* the price went up from 80 USD per 5Mhs, and only half my deposit ever showed up). I have had an open ticket over it for a week now with zero replies since the first day i opened it. I even sent them the block chain links that proved that they basically stole around 45 USD in btc from me. so, i learned a big lesson. their wallets are broken , as the next day the pop up showed "Oh, dont' deposit from exchanges to your wallets, it may take days" bullshit from them. So. That said, with still not refund or anything, I'm kinda skeptical. I hear you tho, but i just hope your not a serious miner with thousands vested there - don't keep all your eggs in one basket. ive seen a ton of miners who've traded hardware there for hashlets, literally investing a shit-ton of USD, and i'm just like groaning going.. wtf.. and then the price increases and now you can't buy anything? Ok, i understand they are probably overwhelmed, but seriously, scale it up and fix it then if you are drowning in millions right? .. but.. unfortunately, i just see all this ending really badly and hopefully not but probably making btc looking shitty again. i don't trust that ceo - his past is too sketchy. not a way to win in the long run at all.. ok done bye, sorry to rant lol, but hey i just want my BTC/money back!??! :D  Edit - I didn't even deposit to them from an exchange, it was just two seperate txs that apprently their broken wallet can't handle properly.. :(  Edit 2 - So i never got that 80 dollar hashlet as a result, so withdrew my btc the next day (the half that made it there) lesson learned again - buy direct from their website, screw the wallet/zenminer interface crud! :\

duster's gonna dust. sounds like an ocd issue, have you tried just ignoring dust tx's? :D
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:53:47
i thought it got deleted but nope... enjoy! :)
PS - if you had actually looked at the first link you would have noticed that the prof was pointing to Nicks' Term paper as a "great example for a term paper".... I'm sorry your so slow.. really...  you should take more time in life, it's too short!
So.. the only real issue here now is this - He's not a prof at GWU. Nor has been, However he has been quoted as being both an economist and law prof there. I can find zero evidence of either. can you? or anyone? thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:55:20
no i don't believe that. Go back and read through the Cypherpunks mailing list archives from 1993 or so -- you will find some very interesting things, one being that he and hal finney were apparently friends and may have worked on different projects together. for example -   Edit - that example is not proof of hal finney's contact with him, this is - 
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:51:20
fwiw, this was the first complaint pdf right?
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:56:08
omfug, i almost posted this way earlier today, but didn't know if redditwould care. FML.. Thanks tho! :)
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:09:00
Hey, so i've been digging further. check THIS out. I'm pretty convinced he's real. the fact that an old address of his shows up on a post for a cypherpunker's party?  That pretty much seals it for me at least.
Also, his past at GWU is sketchy - he obviously graduated from there, but there is nothing anywhere on GWU's site about him, only a link to a paper he wrote as an example of a "Good term paper".   (that's here - 
&amp; Here's the best stuff i've found so far.

@_date: 2014-08-30 02:34:06
ah shit, sweet, thanks yo!!  
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:55:26
yeah this.... i see them as mt. goxx Part 2 now actually. the payouts seem too good to be true, and why on earth do they encourage their users to store BTC on their broken-ass wallet services? (oh so you can earn "Hash Points", so you can better deals on their hashlets of course)!... I'm still working on it, but something smells amiss over there. big time. :(
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:33:17
btw , the douche deleted his post. probably to conceal it all..
here ya go -
1. 
Check the past addresses for him and carefully see this as a prior residence? Coincidence? LMFAO.... -
So yeah, sorry the original moron deleted it today!! but i'm right and your wrong. sorry to dissappoint you, maybe you should call Nick up on the telly and ask?  :D
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:55:09
totally. i feel ripped off in a way. my phone is worth 200x more than this pos plastic dealie.. lol.. but, i still feel safer! :D  
@_date: 2014-09-15 01:18:37
+100 .. XMR is the future, unless gov't makes  it illegal of course.. for now, i'm in hard... and loving it like BTC back in 2010! :D  
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:09:19
There is actually one - i found it facebook, i'd link to it but it's against reddit policy. it's captioned "At a conference circa 1997" - hint - google "Nick Szabo Facebook Public Figure" and you should find it.  Disclaimer - i don't know if its' legit or not, but I have read somewhere that it is indeed him.
@_date: 2014-09-06 02:38:43
he is fuxxed. plus the legacy of his dead sons whom he fuxxed over so hard, and are now all dead... LOSER SCUM - Hope he gets butt-raped daily to be honest.. LOL
@_date: 2014-09-06 01:44:58
i dont' get it. i have one, but what is to talk about? the crappy web ui that is NOT decentralized at all? Seriously. it's just another usb device that does not expose private keys to the net, but is definitely secure assuming you can read the instructions LOL... 
@_date: 2014-08-29 03:41:57
thanks man. I'm no fudder. True poop here. always!! edit - and when the f would Gavin ever lie, right??!! :\  (not proof ,but still. I do believe that Nick is real, he even has record of reciveing a degree, but not a job as a prof there... all the old guys on that mailing list weren't fakes, trust me. (I was there too actually, but noone will believe that so i dont post about it. I missed bitcoin, but i did have an C2.Org remailer account, so im seriously not full of shit, trust me.. and RIP to Hal.. cryogenics aside, he will be sorely missed - in fact IMO,everyone owes him. Maybe zimmerman gave birth to PGP, but hal certainly made it work, without zimmerman. 
cheers and thank you for not shutting the ideas out, they arent even mine!
@_date: 2014-08-31 01:27:31
lol.. who cares, it's still epic yo!
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:41:07
maybe someday i'll get my invite.. sniff, sniff... 
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:10:03
i heard he is the absolute winner of the ultimate loser award. thanks for the confirmations. - edit, sorry for anyone who got goxxed..
@_date: 2014-09-06 04:24:02
Lmfao. why do you consider me "misinformed"? Because i didn't post it first, or because how utterly moronic the article is , which made me not post it here? Derp.,
