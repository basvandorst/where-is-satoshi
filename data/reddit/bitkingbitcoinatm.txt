True. But in the big picture, it would shows we don't need the central banking system which is more important.

There are some ATMs that can perform this transaction. Check some out some of your local crypto ATMs
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:21:26
This is also because General Bytes (one of the largest manufacturers) is based out of Prague.

We're a Bitcoin ATM company out of Memphis. We may be able to help you guys in some aspects if interested!

Looks like an old arcade game converted into a Bitcoin machine

Yellow vest protestors in France have threatened to pull all their money from the banks. They should put it in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:24:29
Do you make these or source them from overseas?
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:02:48
Do you have an operator you use to fulfill these requests?
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:33:58
They should secure it to ground and wall
@_date: 2019-11-02 03:01:45
Hindsight is always 20/20 my friend
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:40:55
Do you guys operate machines as well? How does the hosting work?
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:02:00
We just started a year ago and have gained a lot of experience. Compliance is the biggest factor in my opinion. If you have any questions, feel free to message us
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:50:20
Did you try contacting the company? Did the receipt say anything about failure or success
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:22:06
We have. It all starts with compliance tho, research your state money business laws first
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:23:21
Interesting, do you mind me asking what you mean by you have tried 2-3 companies? As in you tried making your own and failed or you were brought on as n operator under a bigger company?
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:16:54
You could set up a macro on a Excel file then link to your website maybe. Do You have cash management issues or why would you need to provide this service?
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:41:06
No worries I understand. Sounds like you were brought on as an operator, so probably made 1-2% of what the machines brought in. That's typically what companies in the States do at least.
@_date: 2019-10-06 03:22:42
Average of 30k per machine per month according to coinatmradar
@_date: 2019-10-05 01:14:33
I would post on a personal finance forum, they have a lot of good info for people who fall into money. A lawyer would also probably be a good start
@_date: 2019-10-06 03:52:27
Typically a company ones the ATM and pays rent for a location
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:08:49
It was indoor bolted into concrete. They used a firemans 6' crowbar to get loosen it off the wall
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:10:32
Haha got us there. Engineers aren't the best spellers 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:52:17
Yes it's not very feasible
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:24:06
Was it bitcoin ATMs? What company did you rent machines from?
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:51:42
Haha someone definitely thought they came up with the greatest idea
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:53:35
We actually had some fishy activity the same night. We're in a pub/diner and does around $400 in sales a week
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:54:12
Give it a shot. Don't have to invest your retirement or anything
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:29:23
Yep, a smaller ATM that can be picked up by one man is definitely more of a target. We actually cashed out the same night which was super convenient.
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:26:20
Our ATM talks is a terminal that talks and works thru our server. I'm not the expert on the security side but I think they would have to be very talented and hack into our server as well and initiate a withdrawal without any notification that would we see. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:45:23
Inside a pub/diner
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:00:28
It's inside a pub/diner. It happened 10min after the last employee left. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:54:43
@_date: 2019-02-25 00:20:47
We've only been up since October and this was our first and only machine so far. It's was picking up lately tho, around $400 a week. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:21:30
You know what happens when you assume...
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:43:07
"you just have to know how to use it anonymously" that's how it's decentralized? So I gotta go find someone off Craigslist and buy from them? Not the most efficient strategy id say
@_date: 2019-10-06 03:21:33
The cashbox probably isn't large enough to hold anything else
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:30:27
As in personal or the business of being an operator? To be an operator, one would need to register with Fincen as a MSB on the federal level and look into state MTL act if they need a license for the state as well.
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:30:02
Great point
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:48:00
Right now is also an interesting time for Batms. Some people want to start their own and start throwing up machines without looking being compliant with state and federal MSB regulations.  A lot of the companies are going to recieve audits from the IRS this year.
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:22:16
Anywhere from 4-20%
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:08:16
I don't think any operators use the fingerprint scanner in the states, it may be needed for other countries KYC tho. Most machines are on coinatmradar as well like you said and you can always give them a call and ask before showing up.
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:07:42
Yes General Bytes has been talking and very helpful to us so far. Definitely glad we chose to work themm
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:09:42
General Bytes has been very easy to work with and has responded to all our needs in the past. As for their machines, I don't think their objective is to design a impenetrable ATM as that is not economically feasible along with other factors. We did not use the stand GB has which probably would have deterred the robbers longer but that is our fault.
I don't think that would be possible as our hot wallet limits would kick in, cashbox open notifications would appear, etc. 
Which machines do you use?
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:00:27
Did they take a fee
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:00:37
Started my own Bitcoin ATM company
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:45:04
Yep I guess this is what I'm getting at. At what point does the 3rd party services affect Bitcoin or will it at all?
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:46:34
As a Bitcoin ATM operator I think you are spreading wrong information, we do not ask for ssn at our machines. As for KYC, it is actually probably less than using an online exchange to purchase bitcoin where you do have to enter almost all your information.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:40:43
Compliance with state and federal money service business regulations is the biggest thing when first looking into operating
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:34:44
It's really depends on the location and rent associated with location
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:56:29
Freshly picked from the Bitcoin atm tree
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:32:52
Maintenance really and week to week check ups

If you have any questions, feel free to message us!
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:54:55
If you create and use your own server
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:52:29
Sadly New York is one state that it is next to impossible to obtain a license to operate in
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:59:27
We are compliant with all regulations and even have a bank set up for a crypto msb account
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:35:35
Nice! It can be overwhelming starting out so if you need any help or advice, feel free to message!
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:50:09
Not very often. These are older generation machines that needed some hardware upgrades
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:10:22
They want 37k and in return they will give you 2%? That doesn't seem fair
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:02:34
Contact the company. It may have not had enough in the wallet and sent all it had at the time.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:23:51
Haha pretty good
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:41:00
We have messaged a couple people, stepped away from replying for a bit. Really looking for people passionate about crypto and willing to work and operate ATMs with us
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:05:51
Where are you located? You need to register with federal and maybe your state as a msb first to be compliant with anti money laundering regulations. If you have any questions, feel free to message me!
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:34:08
They can be left unattended, just needs power and internet. Convenience stores and gas stations are most popular spots
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:41:18
I think this is actually a great and transparent way to talk to people and meet other operators. I have met some great people thru unconviental methods of reaching out like this. In this industry, you also need boots on the ground if you are wanting to scale and expand.
