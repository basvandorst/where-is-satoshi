I reached to some lawyers based in U.S. but they asked a lot of money and i couldn't afford it. I explained in the blog post how i tried to contact different media outlets asking them to cover my story. And for the insurance, i live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. There are no insurance companies here and even if i could buy insurance for my house i still didn't have the money to do so.

Thank you. I hope this will never happen to you.

I've posted enough evidence on my blog post. I want the U.S. government to give me back my money that they confiscated illegally. What kind of scam is that?

I just edited the post to explain why it was our only option.

I remember i looked it up back then and it was a very huge file like 20 gigabytes or more i can't remember exactly how big it was but i couldn't download it with Iranian internet.

You are right. My biggest mistake was trusting this U.S. exchange when they said Iranians can have accounts on their exchange.

The point is back in 2017 there were not many functional wallets. We could not risk using some software that didn't have any feedback.

Even though I've been studying English in my free time in the past, i still don't believe it to be flawless. I used to work on my accent and speaking skills but since i lost everything my hope vanished and i can't get myself to study anymore.
