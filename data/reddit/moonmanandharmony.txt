Same. I know people who are just now getting into Bitcoin and they get incredibly emotional about any and all price swings, news, whatever... And for the most part I just listen to them and nod and think about how grateful I am that I've moved through that - something I didn't realize or appreciate until I saw them reacting and felt unmoved to do the same. 
Damn it feels good to be a gangster.

My understanding is that miners help to verify transactions of bitcoin users. So after 2140, when there will be no more miners, will transactions be able to be verified? Is it possible that the number of miners become so few as the block value nears 0 BTC that there won't be enough to verify all the transactions (assuming the success and prevalence of Bitcoin remain/grow)? Thank you!

Do you have any plans or interest in making cards for other cryptocurrencies - Litecoin, Ppcoin, etc? Either in the long term or short term? I would no doubt buy a card if multiple coins could be stored on it (or even if I could have one card for each coin)! 
I think many Bitcoin users have some stake in the success of other coins and you'd receive a great deal of support. It seems to me to be a logical next step.

Living in the age of information it is evident that the future of innovation lies in digital technology. Any idea that can be reduced to information has a digital blue ocean market that is just waiting to be sailed and conquered. This includes the idea of cash. Cash is a fraud-proof, instant, fee-free form of economic exchange. Its only constraint is location. The innovative technology of Bitcoin, however, completely solves this problem by allowing your customers to pay you in digital cash from anywhere in the world. I recommend all businesses adopt Bitcoin as a payment method, and I can quickly show you how they work. Do you have 5 more minutes to spend in front of a computer or smartphone?

So would it make more sense to send just one PM to &amp; its moderators, or have as many people as we can? I would want to be respectful with just one message, but sending a volume of messages could speak more to the importance of the subject to the community.
I think we should request mods to post a thread disclosing how much the ad campaign has raised and what their intended plans for it are. And then open the thread to everyone to post ideas and have people volunteer for helping in the campaign - which would then give me a chance to discuss what I could add (along with anyone else)

Woops, accidentally posted this to but it was meant this thread:

And that is the only activity ever produced by Interesting, but I'm sure its not out of the ordinary to make frequent throwaways on &gt; No, you did not. I spent 30 minutes staring at Google images, and I found nothing.
Maybe... The logo was uploaded [here]( 10 months ago on 12/21/12 (hey, wasn't the world supposed to end that day? CONSPIRACY! anyway...). *Today* the image is literally the fourth picture to appear if you google "camel clipart."

ETR:~1month, I'll be graduating with a BA in marketing/management from one of the [top 20 schools in the US]( plus I've worked in publicity in the music industry for &gt;3years (with international and Grammy winning artists) - not bragging, humbly giving credentials. Now while I've been passively watching BTC for &gt;1year, I've only actively engaged in the last month - so I might need assistance in understanding some particular details, but I would love to figure out a campaign. I would love it even more/be more motivated if the project received donations ;)
Question, though: why don't you just donate to the Ad campaign on the side bar? -obviously I know a marketing campaign would be better, but I'm interested in your opinion.
**EDIT:** I'm also graduating in psychology and just started a thesis paper with cognitive dissonance as a main subject, so excellent observations in this post imho
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:53:31
First of all, there is an Ad Campaign donation link in the sidebar.
Second, I agree, [some of us]( have been talking yesterday and today about this very thing. Please check out "[some of us]( to see what we've begun and support - PM the mods!

Thanks man! So then could it be possible that there would be be too few miners mining to verify transactions? Is there a known ratio for how many hashes verify one transaction?

Brian Armstrong, a founder of Coinbase, used to work there. I'm shocked they haven't begun accepting BTC already. Especially since they already deal in tons of currencies. Surely it's on their radar.

What confuses me is why he would pay so much. If you browse the hidden wiki you can find multiple mercenaries for hire. They aren't hard to find and they all charge approximately the same: $20k worth of BTC per job. I guess they could be scams...

can you please expand on *"easy"*. from what I've seen, it is nearly impossible to begin mining for any kind of significant return (in some cases a deficit) nowadays as a beginner. What easy ways are there that produce positive results?

FYI "[Blue Oceans Markets]( is a common business blanket-term that covers all ideas related to the innovation of creating more (and new) value by way of  improving utility, price and cost. It's the idealistic concept of shifting the market to make all competition irrelevant (it's opposite term is, appropriately, call a "Red Ocean Market"). In this case, the competition consists of the banks, credit card companies, etc. "Blue Ocean Market" is just a fast way of saying all that.

I mine and invest with coinbase. Whenever I have an opportunity to spend Bitcoins, I use coinbase to purchase the necessary BTC and then spend them immediately. So I'm essentially spending USD via the blockchain. Hoping that helps the bitconomy in some small way.
Edit: I also keep fractions on my phone for spontaneous merchant inquiries. Hasn't worked yet, but I'm working to spread the word.
