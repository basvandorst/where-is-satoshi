That's not a good argument for mass adoption though.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:53:39
Hurr durr blab!
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:05:41
You can be sure there will be fees to use certain channels.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:23:38
Aaah yes, the 90-hours week, this pillar of modernity.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:45
So this thread is considered FUD?
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:52:14
Fees are still over twice the price. Mass adoption!
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:25:33
Oh shut up please, not everything has to be polarized.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:51:18
Transaction immutability wins again!
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:26:29
Which other exchanges? Name them. Have you used it to get proper fiat usd from them back in your bank account? No you haven't.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:25:53
Where else is left?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:36:47
Half of the threads here are about r/btc/BCH and half of the threads over there are about r/bitcoin. It's such a polarized shitshow that doesn't help anybody.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:35:29
Yeah, I'm asking because every single exchange has vocal people claiming they're a fraud, stole from them, etc. It's very hard to find one to trust.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:24:22
Again, ONLY on Kraken. And in limited quantities. Kraken uses USD and USDT as two separate things.
Also, I've never heard anybody successfully getting USD from USDT but I'm not saying it never happens. It's just not widespread.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:41:21
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:12:59
Any of the others what? No other exchange does tether to usd withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:31:46
You realize that having a "USDT/USD" pair listed on coinmarketcap doesn't mean you can exchange between both at will?
Hell, from the list:


We know that bitfinex doesn't deal with USD since their banking is fucked. 
The list has 4 other exchanges listing a USDT/USD, including Kraken. Never heard of "Exmo", "C-CEX" or "Coinut", eh. I would be surprised if these three exchanges dealt with USD and had any sort of liquidity at all. It's still very few options and the only serious one in there is Kraken. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:00:06
Yes, on a SINGLE exchange, that's overloaded and unresponsive most of the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:44:53
Disk space is so cheap these days, worrying about it now is a red herring.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:35:42
Because sidechains and LN are corporate tollbooths serving Blockstream's profits digging.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:55:27
Out of context? It horrifies me reading *in context*.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:20:04
Yeah, we need Greater Fools to take it to 8,500, surely not us!
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:23:54
They are bound to do KYC, nothing shady in that.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:22:00
How can you "lose", just don't panic sell and wait it out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:54:59
Totally agreed, it's impossible to close them. I was able to open an account on some shitty crypto day trading app and deposit money into it. The only proof of address to my name is my lease (all the bills are the landlady's) and they refuse it, blocking me from withdrawing the funds. Been emailing them for a week to try to close my account and refund but hey, they're in no hurry to do that.
I even tried to shop around for miners, I figured playing with an Antminer would be fun, would give me coins and might even turn a profit. I don't know where you live but I'm in Saigon - 8 million people, tons of tech startups and it's basically impossible to find ASIC hardware. The few shops that exist don't actually have anything in inventory (but they say they do, of course), until you drive to their place and "So sorry, we don't have. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next month. Pay us first and we order from Bitmain and charge you double price?"
I gave up frankly. Mass adoption!
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:58
Another hardfork to sidestep a dumb error made by the devs of a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:50:54
And banning anybody who has a different opinion. Echo chamber much.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:57:42
It's simpler but make sure they let you withdraw. I tried Iqoption briefly and had no problems withdrawing profits but I've heard a lot of places are scam.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:20:44
Nobody has ever cashed out Tethers so everything is normal then.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:28:15
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:07:46
Nobody can cash out Tethers anyway! Haha!
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:42:43
He actually is. But fuck that guy for trying to pimp his referral code.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:29:15
Thanks, will take a look. Nicehash is a cloud mining thing right? (On my phone right now)
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:18:02
Thank you for your flawless argument.
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:39:42
But I already do that for free. :(
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:47:05
So coming back to this - NiceHash only handles BTC payments. Which brings me to my OP, I am unable to buy BTC in any form so far, so that option is out for me. :/
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:42:02
I'm not criticizing bitcoin, I'm explaining how difficult it is to pay money to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:22:35
Fair enough, I've never tried to open a bank account online - only in person and it's always been same-day.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:37:53
So the entry point into BTC/ETH is to spend hundreds of dollars on hardware (or like $2k on an Antminer), learn how to set it up and wait no idea how long to get some coins (with the current difficulty, I'm assuming a single Antminer won't get you far). 
I might actually look into getting a mining rig for fun and learning purposes but that's not something that can be done quickly (especially in the country I'm in).
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:06:01
Right, right, this implies buying a mining rig, of course.
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:40:53
Thanks, I might look into this.
Although, that's your only post on reddit. Are you a shill for genesis mining?
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:20:30
Please let me know if there is any other way to get bitcoins on my first time, other than fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:38:39
I did not know that, I'm glad to hear.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:32:14
Lucky you!
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:51:59
I'm in Vietnam, looks like there's nothing in the city I'm currently at but I might have better luck in Saigon.
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:39:44
Because I ran into difficulties with each previous one, so I tried opening accounts with others to see if I'd have the same problem.
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:33:05
I'm not. I may have doubts about some of the exchanges and their security. I'm mostly sharing my recent experience and reading about others.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:20:28


Not mine, I'm not American. You're also assuming everybody lives near a bitcoin ATM, which is definitely not the case. That does make the barrier of entry not quite low.
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:02:41
Interesting, Coinbase only allows me to input a credit card - possibly because I'm not in the US.
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:30:46
Mentioning that a few exchanges have been hacked is legitimate.
@_date: 2017-09-25 02:19:17
I never had to wait two weeks to open a bank account though. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:40:54
I do agree that using a CC to buy mining power in a mining cloud IS in a way, probably the easiest method to go from credit card -&gt; eventual coins. I'll have to do more research.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:59:45
Regarding your last point, I asked myself that question about a week ago. I thought that maybe it would be easier if I mined some units of a given altcoin and *then* exchange those for BTC. That way I would not need to involve fiat at all in the process.
But let's face it, I do not possess the hardware necessary to even mine some obscure new altcoin with a low difficulty. I actually did a lot of research on the subject and I'm not going anywhere with just a laptop, so that idea is moot. 
I will be in Ho Chi Minh City in a couple weeks and apparently there are 2 bitcoin ATMs there so I might give it a try, if only for the novelty of the experience. 
I will look deeper in Localbitcoins but even via electronic payment (let's say, paypal) or a bank transfer, I would be suspicious of paying a stranger without using an escrow service. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:38:19
Thank you for these links, will look into them!
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:03:50
Strange. Maybe I'm unlucky because I'm not American and living abroad.
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:09:28
How long ago was that? A few if not most of the exchanges appear to be swamped under account creation requests and probably do not have the staff to handle the load. 
And then, how do you personally feel about having your private personal data, like pictures of you holding a proof of ID, being stored on 8 different exchanges? Just curious.
