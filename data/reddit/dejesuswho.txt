I usually call them and press the number to where you think your account has been hacked and pretend that you didn’t know that, that was the line for people with hack profiles. And I would ask them a general question, and they would help you. That’s my shortcut around coinbase customer service. The “hacked account line” usually doesn’t take long to get you to a representative. Hope this makes sense.

I’m still in the profit by a 10k+. I’m not worried, even if this tanks to where I’m not in profit anymore because we all know the value of bitcoin. Ripple is just hype until the government finds a way to fuck them because it’s a centralized currency. We all knew what we were getting ourselves into. For those with week hands, good riddance. Call me greedy, but I’m all in till I’m satisfied.

@_date: 2017-12-14 02:42:06
It was brought to my attention from my wife’s friend who works at a bank, that if their bank finds out you are receiving money from cryptocurrency investments; they have the right to terminate your account? Can someone confirm? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:53:17
Hey fuckers, quick question to anyone who isn’t butt hurt about me saying “hey fuckers.” If I transferred money from my checkings to my USD wallet in coinbase, and buy all them goodshits that’ll make me a millionaire, will it hit the goodshits faster when compared to using my checkings account to transfer into the goodshits? It usually took a week to hit the goodshits from my checkings. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:45:35
Hey, quick question. Do I need to verify my account with binance? Verification steps as in taking a picture of my ID.
