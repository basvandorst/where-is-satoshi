I am not so sure about your assumption that the money is pumped in by "someone or a group". 
Since April 10 at least Bitcoin is suddenly in the mainstream news. Billions of people heard for the first time that there is a decentralized global currency in the making. 
It can e.g. be used right away to bring large sums of money from one country to another. So I guess there are quite a few people who put part of their money into bitcoins, because of an actual need, or just to safeguard them against hyperinflation, confiscation etc. 
So money is flowing into the system - thanks to the spike (I don't want to call it bubble) which triggered the media hype.

Don't you get it that the current government in the US and most **governments worldwide are not on our side** (the 99%). So they are our enemy, because they use the financial system to transfer our remaining real wealth (our labor, resources and land) to the 1% elite that refined that exploitation system since usury has been allowed to flourish. 
Bitcoin is successful because it's driven by the hope of millions, that this p2p means of exchange may give us back a bit of our freedom (to do things under the radar of the allseeing eye). 
And you dream of a government controlled "official" crypto currency?

No reason for criticism. Maybe some people are envious.

I agree, let's be generous and welcome contributions from non experts. 
But, often those experts misrepresent bitcoin in the mainstream media, partly on purpose, partly because they are biased and therefore make wrong assumtions. If they would have studied the intricacies of bitcoin beforehand, they would not do such mistakes, but they didn't, because they are not that interested. 
And that's when I get angry.

It's maybe good that Alex Jones scares people away from buying bitcoins. There is too much demand right now. A slower progression would be better in the distribution phase - the bitcoin market needs some time to develop. 
But also read the comments in that article. Quite surprising that even his own readers don't that that shit.

I sent 12 btc with 14 confirms, at 14:48 over 2 hours ago and not showing either
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:02:14
I set up an account, sent money several times from my Japan Post Bank account to MtGox as domestic transfer (you need to put your MtGox account No. e.g. M12345678X as name of sender - a bit strange but it worked at the Post Office ATM machine). The money was credited to my account within a few hours (officially Mt.Gox says the need one business day). 
When you send bitcoins to your MtGox account it may take up to an hour, when they are busy. For transferring money from MtGox to your bank account you need to "Add a withdraw method" in their page under FUNDING OPTIONS tab "Withdraw funds" - thats where you put your bank data in. Maybe you want some help from a Japanese person to do that - if you are not fluent with language and customs in Japan. They charge 200 yen for sending money. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:45:24
On r/bitcoin it makes sense to promote bitcoins that way
Otherwise, yes I wouldn't like it to become a habit, a requirement, supported by social pressure. And paying someone with the connotation "well done! keep up the good effort" is like padding someone on the back from a somewhat superior position. 
But sending bitcointips to show your willingness to help with a problem, help someone to get over his losses, help someone to get started with bitcoins etc. is kind of nice. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:45:21

Reading between the lines, Peter Vessenes already seems to regret that he filed a suit - instead of getting on the phone and settle things with Mark. I understand Marks English is often hard to understand, but Peter seems to act like an elephant in a china store. 
It's kind of strange, that he thinks that MtGox would move the greater part of its custumer to coinlab "in bulk". 
Usually such things develop over time. Customers don't need to be forced to switch, they could open an other account with coinlab to try it out and then decide which exchange to prefer. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:10:37
In the contract between Mt.Gox and Coinlab I don't find  the clause that Mt.Gox must transfer its american customers in bulk. 
I only found part 2. G that 
"MtGox shall make available to CoinLab during the Term, on-demand and read-only access to MtGox's databases and other related records and data pertaining to any and all customer accounts managed by CoinLab under the terms of this Agreement. "
Part 3 TRANSITION OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS it is not clear and explicitly stated that current Mt.Gox customers need to be transferred to CoinLab. It only talks about CoinLab customers, and that those need to be exclusively either American or Canadian citizens.

@_date: 2013-04-18 10:56:17
First let's see if it can go up to 1000$ I would say. 
Thinking about Satoshi's being used for practical purposes is a bit premature IMHO. 
I think the greatest danger for bitcoin to grow to become a world currency will come from governments and large financial institutions. They will act together and try to prevent large disturbancies of the status quo, e.g. they don't want to loose even a tiny bit of their comprehensive control. 
Bitcoin24 was hit by such an action today. What do we do if they close down MtGox? 
Let's hope that we can make it until some decentralized exchange gets created. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:13:15
No, I don't expect a crash. 
I wish and hope that bicoin succeeds in establishing itself as alternative currency, which could become the mainstream thing, perhaps together with other p2p crypto currencies. 
Thats how I think its going: 
Phase 1 - the currency was started by miners creating coins from 2009 on
Phase 2 - early adopters finance the system with fiat money. Value (energy) - fiat money, gold or services - is pumped into and absorbed by the system, which consequently raises the price of bitcoins in relation to fiatmoney and even in relation to gold, due to the growth of the system in this phase. 
Bitcoins could go all the way up, because its not a bubble what we see here, but the energy and hope of a growing number of people who are fed up with the current mess, got aware of bitcoin and eagerly jump on the bandwagon. 
Phase 3 - bitcoin gets more and more independent of its relation to other currencies. The growth slows down and the steep curve of exchange value to fiat currencies turns into a plateau (not necessarily, if the fiat currency is hyperinflating it will only look like bitcoin rises in value, where in fact all fiat currencies loose value - as is the case now)
This phase requires a large user base. That base is being filled up in the current phase 2. Then people will increasingly trade in bitcoins and get independent of fiat money. 
This is IMHO how it should go, how it was designed to establish itself, to grow and to stay. Let's hope for the best and help its success by being alert and fighting against negative influences. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:47:39
But that's what he offered you. phroztbyt3 did suggest to try to recover as many coins as he can and he wants you to pay him 10 bitcoins from the first that he can recover. That's how I understand it. 
Nice offer, because its only 4.1%. 
I guess if he can recover some, chances are high that he can recover all.
We all know by now that you don't have 1800 fiatdollars, but you have 240 beautiful bitcoins out there. You just need to collect them. (Just to remind you that they don't live in your computer).

No, no, no its doing great. 
Or did you expect more??
Don't expect, be happy that a crypto currency is now in the making.
The current phase is a take-money-in from fiat and breathe-in breathe-out phase to distribute the money to ever larger circles. 
It's not a ponzi scheme, but you can compare it to one in this early growing stage. Money comes in from new users. After the system has collected enough energy by people turning their hard earned fiat money into bitcoins we will have OUR OWN INDEPENDENT CURRENCY. 
But first it will have to fight for its place under the sun. Against all the other currencies, who don't like newcomers.

How come they can have so much business when the Deposit/Withdrawal mechanism for coins and money is so hindered.

@_date: 2013-04-19 12:58:08
yes, I was wondering about that. 
There are a lot of people getting into bitcoin right now. I appreciate that you release btc at that early stage, altough you might get more fiat later. 
I look forward to the time when we don't need to compare btc to fiat currencies - just using btc (mbtc etc.) or other crypto currencies would be great. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:06:39
Verification is NOT necessary to do normal business. Verified persons have higher withdraw limits. 
But they want you to use a bank account that is under your name and you also have to prove (by sending utility bill copies) that you live at the given address. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 08:49:53
why auction it?
They will just change bitcoins to dollars at an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:50:51
No and I mean it. Due to the fact that bitcoin has survived the many problems, DDoS attacks, Mt.Gox downtime, closing of other exchanges, blackout of bitcoinity and clarkmoody etc. and is still going up strongly since a full week from 50 to 130 - due to that, the tone of the media coverage has changed and the now much greater user base got new hope. 
There are billions who have learned about bitcoin recently, many of them want to use it for one reason or another. Moving money across borders, safeguarding from inflation or confiscation (Argentina etc.) and yes speculation. But also there are thousands of small business now thinking how to add "pay by bitcoin" to their businesses. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:53:13
Sorry for posting this again. 
But now that bitcoin is churning uphill aigain just fine, this time with hundred thousands of more users, who have educated themselves in the process of joining the bandwaggon the fear mongering of Alex Jones sounds hilarious.

But when I looked the ticker didn't work. 
Data delayed it said and showed 75$. But MtGox is working.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:03:15
On a different note, bitcoin had strong impact on me too. 
I have tons of other things I wanted to do exactly one month ago, but instead I opened an account at MtGox (I live in Japan) bought a fair amount of bitcoins and then was taken on an unforgettable roller coaster ride. 
Now I think, that I couldn't have spent the time better. It is important to be part of this revolution at this crucial moment and to being a part of it also contributing to its further development. 
I have the strange conviction from deep inside that some otherworldly influence made the fiction that Satoshi wants to be to write the protocol and programs to bring this new currency into this world. We need it and it came just in time. 
That bitcoin survived the first crash and then the crash that wasn't and that it is now going to new heights convinces me that it has divine origins.

@_date: 2013-04-16 16:57:22
Rallies and rollercoaster like ups and downs are good for bitcoin. It's the distribution process in the making. That's how bitcoin grows in value by absorbing money from new users, who get coins and then at least are equipped and informed how to use it. 
And its also good that there are stupid speculators who leave their money here. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:32:13
In the contract they talk only about CoinLab customers. So far all customers are MtGox customers. 
In my understanding, CoinLab customers are only those who have registered and sign on on the CoinLab website. 
That means to the beginning of the contract there were no CoinLab customers, and MtGox customers, american or not have nothing to do with that contract.

@_date: 2013-04-17 11:52:27
Crap - very disappointing. I actually had a good opinion about the Mises Institute and the Austrian School, but not anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:53:18
With or without bubbles it's on the way UP.
Because the recent media hype informed a billion+ people about a kind of "privat" currency. A currency just for us, the 99%. And now some of them are coming. If 1 per mill of a billion is coming its a million people. Each of them wants a coin or two. And brings money. So people bring money into the system.
That traders try to profit by doing what they do, and that early adopters are happy when the price goes up is just a side effect.
So some will part from their coins with a good profit or with a loss, but overall it doesn't matter. The whole process is like breathing in, breathing out and accordingly the charts go up and down. It's a distribution process, that brings the coins or fractions thereof among the people. Let's just be patient. The process needs time to reach out, like waves after you throw a pebble into a pool.

The private key is a 256-bit number = 51 characters in the range 0-9 or A-F in wallet import format (starting with a 5):
e.g. 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF
The public key has 33 characters (0-9, A-F) starting with 1 or 3 and is a hash (derived from) the private key. 
If you have just the private key you can compute the public key with a formula. 
But nobody can compute a private key from the public key, the account address. 
Therefore only the person who has the private key can use the content of an account, which has  the corresponding public key as account number.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:45:42
The bitcoin universe is still so infinitely small that there is nearly limitless room for growth. One groin of sand on a beach. What is one or two billions (market cap) compared to the many trillions of the market. 
We are all early adopters for some time to come. That's why I see the price in fiat going "to the moon".
It would be good if people try to use bitcoins as a means of exchange direktly without going through the dollar. But the btc price for something could nevertheless be related to the current dollar price.

If you do buy now you will get about 27 btc. Plus 8 you will have 35. 
Bitcoins could go all the way up, because its not a bubble what we see now, but the energy and hope of growing number of people who are fed up with the current mess, got aware of bitcoin and want to jump on the bandwagon. 
If you are bold enough and in a position that you can risk your fiat cash, you have a chance as relativly early adopter to become enough wealthy to be able to get out of the current treadmill and do what you really want to do with your life. 
I mean we are now on the way to 200. 1,000 is on the horizon and 1,000,000 is not impossible if you think of how many trillion (dollars) fiat money need to be replaced.  
An also because one million fiat dollars will not be what they are now. 
For such a chance risking 5000 $ is not so much. Even if you loose it, you can earn it back in a few weeks or months. 
But if you miss that chance and it turns out to be the money revolution it promises to be, then you will not forgive yourself for the rest of your life. 
(I bought 100 coins at about 80$ 11 days ago, feel very lucky and will be greatful for the current adventure even if the dream should suddenly end with a big bang.)
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:12:29
but that bubble was a sudden spike. All  happened within 3 weeks from a starting rate of about 50$. The peak of 266 was over 5 times that much. 
Now after the correction - don't want to call it a crash, because it didn't crash to the floor - its where it was 2 weeks ago. 
But now the user base is much bigger, publicity has soared and many more want to come in. That's why its going up again.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:58:35
Good question. Most of us here are hoarding I guess. 
But there are some who need bitcoins for other purposes. Let's hope that one time we all will be able to follow their example.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:50:47
With or without bubbles it's on the way UP. 
Because the recent media hype informed a billion+ people about a kind of "privat" currency. A currency just for us, the 99%. 
And now some of them are coming. If 1 per mill of a billion is coming its a million people. Each of them wants a coin or two. And brings money. So people bring money into the system. 
That traders try to profit by doing what they do, and that early adopters are happy when the price goes up is just a side effect. 
So some will part from their coins with a good profit or with a loss, but overall it doesn't matter. The whole process is like breathing in, breathing out and accordingly the charts go up and down. It's a distribution process, that brings the coins or fractions thereof among the people. Let's just be patient. The process needs time to reach out, like waves after you throw a pebble into a pool. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:26:05
Yes Please read the comments of that youtube video. There you can see that people can see how both Alex and Mike Adams turned around as soon as the socalled bubble and the socalled crash occurred. 
The will turn around again. It just depends from where the wind blows.

Thanks, that's very nice, but

Why is there no instruction anywhere?? Sorry
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:58:42
yes, indeed a bit more concise, but also a bit more complete. 
e.g. he doesn't explain what happens with the physical coins, when the content of that address is transferred to some other account. The coin is spent, the address of that coin doesn't contain any bitcoins anymore and could be used as "fake" invalid money to trick people. Or did I understand that wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:17:52
None of them can think "outside the box". 
So they are all "boxed in" and that is good so. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:06:24
... and if a customer does not approve to that his account is transferred to CoinLab?
... or that his passwords, yubikeys etc. are handed over to someone else?
Isn't the contract impossible to fulfill - I mean is it legally possible for MtGox to share confidential info (passwords, etc.) with 3rd parties?
The whole thing is very strange, stupid or immature OR the brainworks or a sly and clever lawyer. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:05:32
"have to appeal ..." that's what I dont't understand.
"A" want to sell at 100, "B" wants to buy at 99 - how is the trade finally made, e.g. by the MtGox engine? 
How can the enginge overcome that gap?

Please see my edit above. 
I bought 100 BTC 10 days ago at about 80$. 
Now I feel so lucky - but at the same time worry a lot about that things can go wrong. As posted here before, bitcoin is mainly for computer nerds, not for Granpa and Grandma. I like computers and make good use of them since the eighties, but I need to get used to that creepy feeling when thinking 
- what if the program just cannot match my keys
- what if something else out there in the big cloud goes wrong and doesn't know me anymore
- what if etc. etc. 
In order for bitcoin or other crypto currencies to conquer the world - some comfort layer needs to be put between the user and the system. 
Something graphic, visual - that gives people confidence. 
Like having a little savings account booklet that they can put in their safe - with all the code in it. As with current banking it would be ok. if an additional password is needed. 
We had anonymus numbered savings accounts from the post office in Austria - whoever owns the book, owns the money in it if he can provide the password.

That was a few hours ago when it dropped from nearly 195 to under 175 und back up to 187 all within one hour. Now the fluctuations are calming down and we will probably be seeing the next climax in a week. There seems to be a weekly pattern due to banks closing on the weekend. So I think you need to wait for the next chance.

Don't count out MtGox. They have 10 times the volume than anyone else. We need to believe them, that the extreme surge in business overpower them sometimes - they have new machines come in which might solve their problems. Can you imagine how busy their support desk is. I have ticket 71673 at present. No wonder they can not cope with 60 thousand of new customers just in early april 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:29:09
Yes that's how I described the slowly draining of wealth in 
Phase 2 - early adopters finance the system with fiat money. Value (energy) - fiat money, gold or services - is pumped into and absorbed by the system, which consequently raises the price of bitcoins in relation to fiatmoney and even in relation to gold, due to the growth of the system in this phase. Bitcoins could go all the way up, because its not a bubble what we see here, but the energy and hope of a growing number of people who are fed up with the current mess, got aware of bitcoin and eagerly jump on the bandwagon.

Bitcoins are not stored on your harddrive. They "live" in the internet, in the blockchain ledger to be more specific. Your private key may be stored on a harddrive (not so good if connected to the internet), in your head (brainwallet) or printed on paper (paperwallet - best) which is locked away or hidden somewhere.

1. Buy lots of bitcoins with your ill gotten cash
2. Set up a secret letter box company in liechtenstein, panama or elsewhere
3. Invent something that doesn't make sense. Something that no one else had thought about before. Then it's easy to get a patent for that idea. 
4. Send the bitcoins to your secret letter box company and have them change it to dollars or euro. 
5. Sell your patent to your secret company at conditions that suit you. A one time lump sum, or monthly payment as long as you live etc. 
6. That way you have a proper legal income and nobody knows where the money originally came from.

I live in Japan use MtGox in Japan. Domestic transfer of yen in Japan is real time and instantly, but nevertheless it took up to a whole day to appear in my account. 
Withdrawing yen is currently not possible because there is a flaw in the input form "create a new method" (enter your bank data). It doesn't accept the branch name I put in. Tried with other bank accounts didn't work. Waiting for the help desc to respond since yesterday. 
Otherwise I am happy with MtGox and wish them well to get over their problems due to increased volume etc.

@_date: 2013-04-15 01:27:41
sure, that's what most of us would like to happen. 
That bitcoin absorbs the money a growing user base invests, and we, the early or relatively early adopters, will profit, because our coins get more valuable. 
In that way it could also be seen as a ponzi scheme. It's not but in the expanding phase it behaves like one. 
The world is big, bitcoin is tiny, so we can be bullish for some time to come IMHO.
