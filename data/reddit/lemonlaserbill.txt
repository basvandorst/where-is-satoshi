you're right in that regard. I think we were just a little bit on different wave lengths I was discussing macro without regard to micro. You're right about choosing consumption packages and factoring in opportunity cost when deciding on leisure vs work. We're totally off on a tangent now. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:32:57
I don't even understand your argument because your comments have no substance. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:02:23
You as well my friend!
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:48:30
Oh yeah right 
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:07:52
This isn't a very reputable source and certainty isn't pointing to a law but you're right. It looks like the coinage act of 1965 includes provisions that state businesses must accept USD. So yeah I was still wrong. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:11:50
By the way the decree is that the fiat money has value. The decree is not "you must use USD"
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:41:36
Yeah I wish they had just chosen that story because it would at least be somewhat realistic. For example Rick could have created a device capable of creating currency (which is probably digital in their universe so it would be easy for Rick) and then carried out what you said above.

This makes no sense. If there is no market there is no supply and demand. Let's be clear - if someone on the island has a demand for coconuts and the island has a supply of coconuts this is NOT supply and demand. Supply and demand describes the relationship between buyers and sellers in a marketplace.

We just shared a beautiful moment together. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:19:56
No one here seems to understand what fiat money is. It literally only means the currency has no intrinsic value (it is not backed by a good with intrinsic value such as gold).
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:15:55
That's exactly what the first comment said. Please elaborate. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:48:36
Ahhhh yes, this actually really cleared up their point of view (assuming you are correct). 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:06:05
You and I aren't even speaking the same language. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:42:38
No, that would make me worse off because of transaction charges when converting to pay taxes. It would also be very hard to find someone to trade with. I'm not arguing that you should use AUD, simply that you have the right to. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:54:28
Have you studied economics? Genuinely curious. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:43:11
No one should be tying legitimate economics to this episode. Rick and Morty is an excellent show, but that scene makes zero sense. The currency is valued against itself (How does that even work?) and he devalues it by entering a zero in a computer.  Believing that is possible is like believing someone could just type $150 into a computer for FB stock and all of sudden it would just be worth that. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:06:42
Lol nice contribution. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:24:11
Now you're just stealing other people's comments. Nice. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:44:07
In what way?
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:16:55
It seems that way, but this is not true. Gold can be used to fabricate goods. It's an excellent conductor of electricity for example. A dollar bill has no value because you can't make anything with it or consume it. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:50:14
I don't see how bodily need has anything to do with economics. Obviously supply is an issue but the amount of resources on a given body has nothing to do with laws or theories of economics. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:33:59
Okay, I believe you. We were talking about trade though. Hence why you brought up "Legal tender for all debts public and private". So the paying taxes comment wasn't really relevant and doesn't prove your point.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:50:34
How could one be subject to the laws of supply and demand when there is no supply and no demand? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:57:54
If you enjoy learning econ casually in your spare time check out Milton Friendman's lectures on YouTube and some of his books if you haven't already. Honestly, economics is one of the most important things we can study and it's almost never required in High School, at least in the US. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:12:21
Haha, well it's better to admit you're wrong and learn something than be in denial. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:28:48
In what way are US citizens forced to use USD? That statement doesn't make sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:36:42
Intrinsic value means the object has value outside of the market, everything has value in the market of course. Think as if you are on a desert island alone. Gold could be used to kill something or to make tools whereas cash offers nothing in that situation. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 03:08:23
Finally someone who makes sense! I'm going with this story because it's actually feasible. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:14:21
Not exactly... the govt can't force businesses to accept USD. If I wanted to open a store that accepts only AUD it would be perfectly legal. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:22:04
Okay point to the law that states "Businesses in the US must accept USD." If it exists you'd be able to find it easily.
