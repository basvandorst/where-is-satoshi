Idk, not seeing too many useful dapps other than people using it to make other tokens off it. It’s neat but still not what I would say super useful. Fun to develop on though.

This post makes me want to buy bitcoins.

You should be.  "Buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy."  --buffett.  Right now, everyone is greedy.  I've bought several times and were when everyone was saying: bitcoin is dead.  So I'd wait for that.

Sold a small percentage as well today. Still pro bitcoin long term. No one can predict when a correction will come but this sudden runup seems irrational. Having been through this in 2014 I plan to buy more when people start once again writing articles that bitcoin is dead... just like I did last time.

Like I said I only got rid of a small percentage. I'm doing just fine and I have my reasons for doing it now.   But I also subscribe to the Buffett: "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful". Right now you and many others are greedy and people are crazy to want to buy near the all time high. 
Markets have been around forever. They have bear seasons and bull seasons. I'd be surprised if there isn't another dumb article written about the demise of bitcoin in the not too distant future. (E.g. Your life time (may it be long and prosperous!)). 
Meanwhile I'm enjoying the ride up along with you.
