Underrated comment of the century.

EDIT: Made my 2 points into 3. 
tldr; Three things that I feel really sure of: The solution is a 24 word seed, the words were selected before the creation of the puzzle with an explicit order in mind, and the words make up a phrase of some significance, perhaps to the cryptocurrency as a whole. 
1. Someone posted a link to the Bitcoin stack exchange earlier with someone asking about creating a 24 word seed. This post was made at the end of this past January, and I'm pretty sure its the creator of this art for a few reasons. Also, if he used a 12-word seed it would be a matter of days to brute force the seed if you were able to collect the correct words (or even most of them). If you were doing a several thousand dollar giveaway, would you want it to be easy?
2. This goes back to the Bitcoinstackexchange post. If the creator was asking about how to make a specific mneumonic seed based on the English BIP39 words of his choosing, then he definitely selected the words beforehand. It is possible he did not, but extremely unlikely. Why go to the extra effort you randomized everything? 
3. This sort of overlaps with number 2, but remember, the puzzle's creator said we would be certain when we figured it out. It will be a phrase that makes sense. I don't think you'd even need to brute force the seed if we only had 12 words. Once you found the correct set of 12 words a sentence generator online could probably put it together. This is yet another reason why we probably have a 24 word seed. If the puzzle has a somewhat coherent statement about it and it holds 24 words, it'd be a lot harder to eyeball a meaningful statement out of them.

I totally forgot about that! We're dealing with 11 pairs, so it could have something to do with "almost open" (possibly being the last pair?) or "Try +1"?
Also, here's the stack exchange post I was talking about

That means (for proof and work) each appear 7 times independently and 27 times if you include the hyphenated "proof-of-work".

Thanks man! I was worried that I may have made a mistake with the addresses.txt file. Is it formatted [ "word", "word", "word", "word"] for each line?

What values did you have to change inside of the pastebin for your particular setup? I've been having issues with the code all night. It's been a few years since I've been coding, but I'm getting to the point where I think it's on my NPM installation end rather than my code.

Thank you! Your most recent comment is as insightful as ever!

Except for investing some $33M into Bitcoin this past Spring?

Question: Is this safe? Would this work without risers? I feel like having those 3 cards so close together and without auxiliary power you are asking for serious heating/performance issues and potentially even fried motherboards.

Okay, I'll bite :D

I would wait until things become a bit more stable, but I don't think this is the last time that we will see BTC at 1000 USD or higher. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:39:14
Honestly dude this is an insanely high price for a Bitcoin. You should wait until the price crashes sometime within the next couple weeks. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:33:16
It doesn't really matter if you are trying to buy in at the current low prices. The price that you buy it with is locked in.
