They will never understand. Bitcoin is going to $10000. Dont believe me, sell all your bitcoins if you do not believe. There will be winners and losers in this game.

23 years is too long to wait, this better not fuck up the price of BTC. I got in a bit late but I'm planning on hitting a million on this.

Relax they can manipulate all they want but they will be the suckers in the end when it hits $10000. These are the sort of risks that all early adopters have to face, the ridicule, the market manipulation, being accused of being criminal drug dealer. Those fools will never understand the power of bitcoin.

You will never get it. I'll see you at bitcoin $10000.

BOOOOO Korea. The Koreans ought to petition and protest this, they're missing out on all the sub $10000 early adopter gains.

I dont understand this joke but it is only a matter of time. We're all getting rich! FILTHY FUCKING RICH! The price is over 1000 again, next stop 2000.

Not harsh at all, i'm a true believer. just bought some more today with my paycheck last week. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:03:42
Who the hell cares? We're all getting rich!

Kid you are doing the right thing. Once we get to BTC = $10000 I will personally tip you $100 dollars stay on this username

Very good, get all the chinese to start buying right away. Call all your chinese friends and tell their mother brother and sister overseas to start buying. We're going nowhere but up!

Good riddance. 
BANKS: stay the fuck outta BTC
let the $1000 mark be a warning to you. next up, we're to $2000. then $3000 and then on until $10000. Finally the little guy is winning against the banks, we'll be getting all the sub $10000 price early adopter gains while all the banks catch on too late.

Dont eat it yet, wait until it crosses back over 800 for goodluck.

early adopters like us will always be ridiculed. that's the trade off between getting in on the sub $10000 BTC early adopter gains while every one else thinks its bad
