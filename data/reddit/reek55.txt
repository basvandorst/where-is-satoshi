No big players can prevent new privacy features from coming to bitcoin. They can only make it more difficult. Has everybody forgot about UASF?. Worst case, as Andreas pointed out, you get forks. You don't need permission to innovate. You just need to follow the fork that you want to support.

Bitcoin Cash was soft forked multiple times (by a small group of people), without the majority vote the users and nobody seemed to mind. They are more concerned that the payments are fast and cheap.

Geuko is boy (4 years old), who lives in a town near me in The Netherlands, Europe. He has a very rare decease called Acute flaccid myelitis (there are only 7 other known cases in Europe). There are a few local initiatives to collect money for a trip to a Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore in America, but so far we only have raised EUR 88 000,- of the EUR 250 000 needed in total.
This is the donation page: 
This is his blog:  (unfortunately only in dutch)
Unfortunately they don't have a bitcoin address. They do have a IBAN bank account: NL08 INGB 0007 5028 26. If you want to choose this charity, I can arrange a meeting with myself and Geuko an make vlog of the event, so you can see this is not a scam. I can act as an intermediator so when you send the 1 BTC to me, I will send the money to his charity. I am even willing to pay upfront from my own bank account first.

Edit: I send an email to the foundation so I can help them setup a wallet themselves, so they can post the address on their site.

It's a real shame (it looks like) they only mention the price and not the technology behind it.

You should NOT trust this wallet. If you don't opensource it from the beginning, that means you don't understand security or are incompetent. Both are bad.
