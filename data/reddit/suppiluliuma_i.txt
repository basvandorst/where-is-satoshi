Go is not comparable to C/C++ and if you knew anything about either of them you would understand.

Don't think just because your upvoted by your fellow morons I am the one who's wrong. Please go tell historians and anthropologists how hunter-gatherers needed to inflate and debase their non-existent currencies to go to war.
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:31:51
Yes, as the money issuer it has a monopoly on issuing currency. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:01:06
hahaha and genghis khan's inflation? Did he split horses in half? or how about hunter gatherer communities? Quit shitting yourself man. war can be self-funding if you do it right, conquer, take shit, use it to conquer some more.

nice irreverent catchphrase, but have you guys ever actually answered this question? I've yet to see an actual answer.
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:53:04
Of course. If there is one thing that the capitalist class is lacking in right now, it's idle wealth. Nope, there's none of that here. No desperate chasing of returns or whatnot, Nosiree

No it's *definitely* true. I've had 5 accounts with three of the big 4 and two credit unions and none of them charged me for checking OR a basic savings account. what the hell are you on about?

you're a dumb fuck you know that. If you clicked the eBnaking option and expanded it you'd note that if you only operated online or through ATMs there's no fee. Where I live now in Indiana there isn't even a BoA in 40 miles, I've never set foot in a branch.
So I say again, YOU'RE A DUMB FUCK MATE

I didn't even bring financing and debt into the equation, I was simply talking about property as an illiquid asset, but since you did let's talk about that. 
Have you thought about the effects of deflation on any industry with a long payoff time, where you have pay a lot for a long time, often on a line of credit, before you ever see any money? The deflationary period from the 1870s-1890s was absolutely murder on farmers, and led to mass movements of a scale that wouldn't be seen again til much later. Now a much smaller percent of our population is farmers, but plenty of industry works this way.
I know for a fact it would kill construction, at least that of small entrepreneurs like my father who have to rely on credit to purchase supplies and pay wages until a project is done. Maybe bigger firms could have enough cash to take the hit, but you'd be killing the small fry. You'd be killing a lot of small business, who rely on credit to cover costs until things pay off, only the big guys can afford to make these upfront costs in cash.
In addition, the falling prices would again hurt anyone who sold any sort of commodity, from farm goods to mining products. Indeed, these were the two main factions in mass movements of the late 19th century. The only people who benefit from deflation are those who are hurt by inflation, wealthy individuals who hold lots of cash and are net creditors.

Saying that deflation is theft from people holding no deflationary currency at all is rather silly. When something gains value because demand increases for it, that is deflation, but that is not theft from those who don't own that thing.
is partly incorrect. Just as these things become better holders of value in times of high inflation ([See Venezuela] ( in a time of deflation, they steadily become less and less valuable.  Deflation disproportionally affects those who  hold most of their wealth in illiquid assets while benefiting those who have large liquid assets (such as cash).
Since the poor and middle class hold the vast majority of their wealth in their property like houses and cars, while it is almost exclusively the upper class who can have large cash reserves, deflation results in a transfer of wealth upwards, which I personally find highly undesirable.
