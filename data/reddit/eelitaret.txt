idk about absolutely insane yet. Whats insane is people at a casino using cash advance for slot machines. That's guaranteed to lose you money, but they do it.

You're the one supporting puppy mills to get inbred puppies at an overpriced rate. Sorry to hear you experienced that.

So.... If I hodl 0.1 then I can eventually afford 10% of a house? Nice
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:59:24
By that you mean you chose to give thousand of dollars to sick people who breed puppies in tiny cages for profit when there's already a surplus without homes?

Wouldn't we pay taxes in crypto that the government then could bail people out with?

It's a good thing that they don't like it for the reasons we do like it.

So like exchanging usd to bitcoin would be easier? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:45
I guess so, I don't really get it either, I thought the whole point of bitcoin was to evade all government meddling with currency.

Not when you go zero to sixty on your face! Everyone would be better if someone said HANG ON first
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:05:55
I don't know enough about hanging to dispute this

They could have a heat pump/air conditioner running though, they can still cool in low temps with little electricity bc outside air is so cold.

It's like he got yours
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:18:46
No, you'd filter the exhaust of all weedy smellz with activated carbon/charcoal filters or something like that. I mean realistically they could also just have AC keeping the house at like reasonable temps with the lights, probably like 90 degrees inside the apartment lol.
