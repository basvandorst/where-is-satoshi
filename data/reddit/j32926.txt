Bitcoin is intentionally made the way it is so that you CAN'T use monetary policy or other means to manipulate its value like you can with fiat.

Mining does not create value, there is an important distinction! This is akin to saying a treasury creates value by printing a new bill (not to replace an old worn out bill but to add into circulation). Mining is just the way bitcoin handles coin dispersion, and both uses resources and devalues remaining coins in circulation.

Technically Mt Gox is an exchange, so it doesn't actually "sell" the Bitcoins.  A more accurate description would be:  "Mt. Gox knew that it did not have enough bitcoins to back up the posted balance in wallets yet continued to allow exchange trading of "phantom" bitcoins without notifying customers to collect fees"
On a side note, this "fractional reserve" mindset whereby only a fraction of total deposits actually exists is exactly how banks operate (exactly what gox was doing).  Fortunately central banks guarantee all such deposits, so in the event of a crisis they can step in to give or "loan" the banks money.

I think you hit the nail on the head.  These are all problematic concerns and will take some time to iron out.  The important thing, however, is that all of these issues can be solved.  They are dwarfed in comparison to the problems of early money.

The DoJ has always been above the law, and anything but "just".

Putting two spaces after a period is an old school practice that i'm sure a large portion of adults who used computers in the 90s got accustomed to.

Like so much current financial regulation today, I feel the direction of the regulation is a bit misled.  The resounding central idea seems to be "consumer protection", but laws that are put in place often backfire in one sense or another by creating either imperfect competition or inducing businesses or consumers to take risks or do things they wouldn't normally do in a free market environment (financial crisis 101).  
Regulation, almost by definition, is a double edged sword.  In this sense you hinder the party that must comply with the regulation in exchange for added consumer protection.  It is true that regulations may result in mutually beneficial results for both seller and consumer.... but allow me to pose a hypothetical question:  If it is good for both seller and consumer, wouldn't the seller do it anyway thus negating the purpose of the regulation in the first place?  "Ay but regulations protect us from large corporations running ponzis and other illegal activities that steal our money!"   Don't get me wrong, it is good to have some regulation/legislation in place to specifically protect individual rights (life, liberty property) and economic equality.  Though the goverments track record on staying within those boundries is piss poor.  I can say with near certainty that regulation will not be good for bitcoin in any sense with the exception of giving it more exposure and legitimacy in the financial world.

Good post, the differences are quite large.  Would be hard to believe that this was the same person.  (Edit: convinced we have the wrong guy, deleting this post.)

For clarity here, Mt. Gox does not buy or sell bitcoins like a merchant would buy or sell a rug.  A merchant takes temporary possession of the rug and profits by selling it for more than he bought it for.  
Mt. Gox is more like a crooked poker dealer.  They hold your cash for you and provide a means by which you can move your chips around, profiting off of fees or "tips" for the service.  However... if they are pocketing some of the cash on the side, what happens if everyone decides to cash in their chips at once?  It won't all be there,  Goxxed!!!!!!

Seems pretty consistent with the [news week article]( that was released a few hours ago.  That is, it is consistent in relation to the behavior of the man Dorian S. Nakamoto (birth name Satoshi Nakamoto) that news week has identified.  Might have to dissect the article a bit and dig deeper to prove 100%

Don't get me wrong, cryptocurrencies are a better medium of exchange than M-pesa, but since M-pesa's value is guaranteed by the cell phone company and almost everyone has a cell phone, its rise to popularity has been very easy (that is the advantage I'm referring to). It fulfills the common definition of money as the most liquid stable asset available. If Vodafone started working with BTC instead of M-pesa I imagine BTC would have a similar rise to prominence in the region.

1. In a transition to BTC investment products would not see reduction or gain, they would simply be repriced in BTC. In a full economic transition to a decentralized currency you are correct in that assets won't see nominal increases due to currency weakening over time or central bank credit injections. This is not to say that investment products will weaken, it is to say that they would be more appropriately valued based on nature supply and demand.
2. Fact, governments especially don't like this because central banks buy treasury bonds in order to maintain lower interest rates. This provides a natural and infinite outlet for the government to finance its debt obligations.
* Is government economic intervention a net positive or net negative for humanity?
 In the Keynesian theory, economic intervention is said to lessen the damage of massive inflationary or deflationary periods by artificially changing market set interest rates to provide excess credit availability in deflationary periods and decrease credit availability in inflationary periods.  In the Austrian view this is rubbish and any manipulation only delays or prolongs necessary market corrections as well as funding inefficient and wasteful expenditures including but not limited to government spending.  
* Would we have the same potential economic evolution without government influence? 
Not sure if I understand what your asking, but rest assured that government expenditure is less efficient than private expenditure, and thus economic productivity would benefit from minimal government influence.
* Does rapid economic growth matter most? OR Are we sacrificing the progression of morality and humanity for increased economic prosperity?
Is it immoral to prosper?  I think not, but I would agree that the way money, forex, and some other investments are handled by the banks and the SEC is very immoral and in many cases downright illegal. It doesn't have to be a sacrifice, it just seems that way in today's environment.

This is old news to anyone with a decent background in monetary theory and/or the Austrian school of economics.  Ultimately, the ideal currency is neither inflationary or deflationary, it is STABLE
