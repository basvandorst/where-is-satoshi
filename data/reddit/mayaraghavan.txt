this is why i stay and play in the cryptospace, because the people who have paid me in crypto are more honest with payments than anyone else. it has been interesting to me from the beginning that this is about not having to trust, but in the one-to-one transactions people paying me in crypto have always been so honourable, i tell you. this is one reason why as a vedic astrologer i am committed to only accepting crypto until it becomes even more popular. well done to you!
