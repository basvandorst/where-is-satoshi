To the news! Things appear to be close to falling apart. Trump investigation/Steele dossier, the Jerusalem business, more middle east shakeup, etc. The old guard is looking to stash its money.

Oh man, you just ratcheted up my fantasy. Tulips. Yeah, that's nice.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:26:12
/s   you dropped this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:09
Watch closely and you'll notice that the FUDers will be here commenting in force when the price is dropping. They go away when the price starts recovering because they are only paid for a certain time frame.

So bitcoin is only worth the juice it takes to mine it? Okay, got it.

See, I don't understand why you would take the time to post this. It's like you're gloating that you're smarter than everybody here for comparing bitcoin to tulips but you don't know appear to understand why bitcoin works. Would you like to learn? Or do you just want to feel superior to people who've made millions and institutions like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange?

Damn, the Ruskies really are fired up in here.

So keep it in the fish tank? Got it.

I agree. So many newcomers are wary that it might be a scam like they always hear then CB pulls this shit. Coupled with Judas saying "tough shit, there's no law against us manipulating coins," it has weak hands bailing.

Somebody needs to make a gif of Saving Private Ryan's storming of the beach, but with price drops killing newbs and weak hands, culminating with the flamethrower shooting huge gains and burning dollars out of the pillbox. Not me, but someone should make it.

I just got started and I've already figured this out. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:00:52
Yeah, but eight arms to HODL? That's impressive.

 Whoosh!

That's the kind of thinking that led to people living like paupers while owning a hoard of gold buried in jars in the yard back in the gold standard days. "I can't spend any, it might be worth much more some day."

Perhaps we need to start talking in millibit units. I was just contemplating a post to discuss the subject. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:26:15
It's possible that companies looking into blockchain implementations will one day have very valuable stocks, but this is like the Netscape internet days. It's too early to tell who will prosper but keep watching the space.

Back on the 8th of September Blockchain had me transfer all my btc to a new address and made that my default wallet and archived my old address for some reason. As far as I can tell, you can only get your bcash if your btc was in your default wallet in August 1st. So where the hell is my bcash Blockchain? Has anybody seen their bcash balance on the Settings/general section?

I've found that people think of it in terms of stock and think that they have to buy a full bitcoin at minimum. This stock perception may also be why they think it's a ponzi scheme. Sometimes explaining that there is no promise of getting rich and the price rise is simply the scale up of adoption helps them understand. In regards to the full bitcoin perception, at some point it may be helpful to start using millibit units in conversations.

See, a pyramid scheme promises that everyone will get rich. There is no promise of riches here. It's possible you'll lose everything. But people are getting rich in the simple fact that the technology works and adoption drives the price up. Early investors ride that increase but eventually it will stabilize. Please take some time to understand the technology.

Where the he'll are they getting a loaf of bread for $1.40? Back in the day I don't think they had the equivalent of the super shitty store brand foam bread substitute.
