I don't view price volatility as a good thing for a currency.
@_date: 2016-08-28 18:02:08
Right.  And that's...good?
I'm not saying volatility is unique to bitcoin, just something that isn't praiseworthy in a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:55:01
Vendors don't know that, though.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:38:40
You are being down voted by the delusional, but if you make 10,000% on an investment for which you have no rational basis to establish a fair value, and don't sell at least some of it, you're just being greedy.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:28:06
Maybe, it's just numerous studies have shown that loss is much more hurtful than never having.
To use a crypto example, I put $100 in Ether and then sold it for $10,000.  If ether crashed and I only sold it for $200, I would absolutely not be saying "Hey, $100 for free!".  I'd have been devastated.
So it depends on what you think you can handle.  I didn't get in to crypto to make money.  I was hoping to be able to use it.  It's not my investment style at all.  I don't have the tolerance for that sort of risk.  My guess is many others don't either, but they just don't think about what would happen if bitcoin crashed to zero.  My guess is many of these people, who scream "HODL" no matter what, wouldn't be with us any more.

Bitcoin only up 110% in 3 months! Sell, sell, sell!
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:23:41
Remember if you have an erection for over 4 hours after noticing that block size, see your doctor!
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:05:53
Yeah, but on the plus side it's increased recognition.  Lots of people have at least heard of Bitcoin now.  But negatively, it's raised transaction fees so that Bitcion is no longer useful.  If Bitcoin had scaled, all the attention might have been a great thing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:36:40
It's not a store of value if it has no value (meaning you can't do anything with it).  If people didn't assume that one day you'd be able to spend it again, it would be worth $0.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:33:00
Yes.  This is definitely a trait all those who go to the gym share.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:27:15
Including the dev team.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:28
This whole situation highlights just how far Bitcoin has fallen. Remember when we were trying to develop a currency that wouldn't be regulated? Now you're desperate for it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:39:17
Yes! I've always said bitcoin died the second ASICs were created for mining.
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:50:28
I had suggested to someone I know who does street art and murals that she could include a qr code and she said she'd heard it was difficult to get working right. Any trick to it? Does it just need to be of a certain size?
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:21:52
There aren't enough people using it yet for it to be stable.  The price is fairly arbitrary, and therefor will be volatile.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:43:16
How can you have a free market and a government at the same time?  
Let's take a fairly extreme "minarchest" view and assume the only function of government is law enforcement (of a very small number of laws).  If I don't think law enforcement is doing a good job of enforcing the law, can I hire a different group to enforce those laws (protect my rights)?  If yes, then this isn't really a government function, but rather a market function.  If no, then it's not a free market, because I'm having a service forced on me.
The same follows for any other government function.  If it's voluntary and open to competition, how can you call it a government function?  If it's not, how can you call it a free market?
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:45:00
Those arguing for the state don't hold themselves to the same standards.  Anarchists have to prove a utopia; statists just have to have good intentions.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:38:14
What does that have to do with this thread?  We were discussing capitalism and bank bailouts.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:36:41
Edit: They won't care about collecting from you, if that's what you mean.  But they will collect from any point-of-sale device, for example, or from any business that tries to use it, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:05:58
Yeah, I don't get it either.  Is the joke simply that someone stamped bitcoin on a dollar?
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:04:29
Nooooo!  I just moved from Sterling.
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:21:25
Pretty soon it'll be much cheaper to move money with WU than bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:48:58
It's a Merkle tree.
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:26:47
No.  Capitalism is voluntary exchange by definition.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:48:41
It shouldn't be zero if people are willing to pay more. The small block size creates artificial scarcity. Its true of any product where demand is higher than supply. Price raises until the demand at that price is no longer there. Look at Superbowl tickets for example. The only difference is that is actual scarcity, as opposed to the block size which is arbitrary.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:26:24
My point is it would be cheaper to use a credit card. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:27:29
Did op edit the post? What was the reference to government?
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:21:20
Unbeliever! Burn him!
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:00:45
Just like how heartbleed was immediately discovered?
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:31:24
As a mostly outsider who is subscribed to both and the way both sides talk about bitcoin immediately makes me think of political or even religious factions.  I've certainly never seen technology talked about this way.  Even Linux vs. Windows vs. Mac doesn't compare.
Everybody on the other side is "other" and is obviously a demon working to bring about the destruction of the world.  It honestly looks that bad.
I can't imagine bitcoin succeeding in an environment where all disagreements are personal/religious, and not technical.  They certainly aren't scientific as facts are ignored by both sides, and most arguments are based on theory.  (If we did x, then y would definitely happen, though no proof is given.)
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:18:52
Don't have time to watch the video. Could someone tldr why you need inflation for an unlimited block size?
I assume miners would just add transactions until they solve the pow. What is the problem with this?
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:39:09
But isn't there something like a 10% transaction fee to buy a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:19:48
Why would miners want to destroy trust in Bitcoin? That would tank the value, and then what is the point of being a miner?
In the past, we've seen miners do everything they can to protect trust in Bitcoin, even acting against their short term interests.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:21:47
Probably based on the presentation of the news, and not the news itself.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:37:02


And that about sums up why Bitcoin is screwed.  You dislike "them".  BU isn't a them.  It's code.  Nobody cares about code any more.  It's all us vs. them now.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:59:50
Also *Countdown to Zero Day*.  One of the best books I've ever read.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:16:43
Pfft, that price is so $100 ago.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:54:18
I bought such an expensive shoe rack :( I mean, it's nice and all, but it's like a $500 shoe rack now.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:27:00
Are you suggesting that your laugh was out loud?
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:09:01
Increased adoption would decrease stability.
@_date: 2015-08-07 01:55:18
Been buying a lot from overstock.com recently. Easier than using a credit card (and safer).
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:47
If this was a regulated market, most of us wouldn't be here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:58:42
No, the massive transaction fees do.
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:08:27
Crypto has (and needs) rules. What it doesn't need is rulers.
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:54:36
It depends on your definition of democracy.  If you mean "rule by the people", then no, anarchy isn't compatible with that, unless by "the people" you mean 100% of the people.
Voting, however, is perfectly consistent with anarchy, as long as any resolutions are non-binding.  If majority opinion begins to be enforced with violence, then it's no longer anarchy.  Having lots of rulers is not necessarily better than having one.
That's how Bitcoin works.  Everyone can vote, and everyone can ignore or accept the results.  You can pick whatever chain you'd like, you can ignore the cryptographic signings, and no one will attack you for it.  But there are consequences to going against the consensus.  
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:24:03
The only ones who could afford the fees.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:28:10


Why is this?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:40:39


Way off.  I don't do it because it's a violation of my ISPs ToS and I risk being held legally responsible for whatever neighbors do.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:27:19
I agree, but what does that have to do with a high bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:17:29


And while that might not be a worthwhile tradeoff for people trying to buy a pizza, it's probably worth it for people who want privacy.
I didn't say bitcoin would go away, just that it won't be used for privacy sensitive applications.
In theory, some of bitcoin's privacy problems could be solved, but I've lost any hope in bitcoin's ability to grow.  I don't think it will ever be anything other than what it is right now.  Maybe used as some sort of "gold" equivalent, or as an intermediary between other currencies.  But if we can't even get a 2MB block size, I can't imagine ever getting privacy.
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:50:25
Exactly.  Probably you wouldn't actually get convicted if you could prove others were using your connection.  But you risk getting shot by the SWAT team, and might have to pay $50,000 or so to prove your innocence.
I've thought about doing it and forcing the traffic over TOR or a VPN, but there are issues with that as well.  The legal framework just isn't ready for this yet.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:08:58
It would cost you more to move that coin than it's worth, though.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:29:32
Last time I resolved to be completely relaxed on a roller coaster I nearly blacked out.  You must need muscle tension for blood circulation at high Gs.
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:28:53
But not same as 300 to 400, which I think was the point.  Look at percentages, not dollar amount.  A $100 increase in the price of a Bitcoin isn't as impressive as it used to be.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:48:40
But currencies with much better privacy protections are already becoming popular. I don't see anybody using Bitcoin for such uses 10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:36:25
Yeah I'm really confused by this. If you don't like Bitcoin Cash then just sell it or ignore it. I don't understand all this hate.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:59:58
It would be called wrong initially, but the judges would look in to it and overturn it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:13:44
The majority of people have long since lost the ability to evaluate this stuff rationally.  Religious debates are far more civil and reasonable.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:40:31
This has little to do with bitcoin.  What you've encountered is an important ethical problem that we all face.  You'll encounter it at all levels of school, and all through your professional life.
You have two choices: 1) You can play the game, please your teachers, and get good grades, or, 2) focus on your education, produce good work, and roll the dice on the results
Option 1 is the safe path.  You'll do fine in life if you follow it.  You'll get into college, and get a decent job.  But option 2 is the path that the greats take; it's the path of a Satoshi Nakamoto.
It's a question of self-esteem.  You know what you produced was good.  Don't get upset if your teacher can't see it.  That's not in the domain of your control.

Power does not grant moral authority.  You can force my compliance with a gun, but all the violence in the world won't make it right.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:30:03
They ban would be on the business end.  To try and stop bitcoin all together would be impossible.  But to stop Amazon.com from adopting it would be easy.
@_date: 2013-10-14 13:59:18
Doesn't it take a long time to verify a transaction?  Like 30 minutes?
How does that work at a register?
I understand you can pay extra to have the transaction processed faster, but how much does it cost to have it done in 10 seconds or so?  And would that scale if everybody started doing it?
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:31:16
What didn't you like about it?
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:12:34
You said it was a "load of crap". Do you mean it was a load of crap but you liked it anyway? If so, why?
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:07:14
Government is founded on groups doing what individuals can not.  So where does the group get the moral authority that the individuals don't have...  MAGIC!
