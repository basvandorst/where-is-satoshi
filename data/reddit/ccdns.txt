applepay is built into the IOS so kinda easy to get those numbers and a bit like counting IE as the browser of choice on a windows machine.

what was the milling/engraving setup you used?

The genie is out of the bottle, they can crack down on bitcoin, but other crypto currencies can easily take it's place.
I can't imagine it would be all that difficult to switch out BTC for an alt coin and carry on business as usual, maybe not to the masses and for high prices, but there will still be an audience for it.

I would be suprised if it weighed more than 15 grams.
18k gold is 75% pure and currently around $32/gram.
being a casting, it doesn't really have much labour costs associated with it so 3.25 btc is a little high.
If anyone wants one but at a reasonable price, let me know

got a chip on your shoulder there son.


you got all that from my comment history? or just that 1 line?


Again your incite-fullness just blows my mind, it's like you really know me man.
Kurdistan as it stands "as a nation" is non existent but I am sure you would like that to be a reality, no?
Which by the way was my fucking point you ~~retard~~  sorry to the mentally handicapped.

We need more payment gateway options for the ecommerce packages that don't need to go through a 3rd party.
Not every retailer wants to cash out their BTC straight away.
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:34:28
yeah bitcoin is unique there isn't it? [sarcasm] before bitcoin there were no such things as fraud, money laundering, extortion or scams.
Damn bitcoin to hell [/sarcasm]

heh was in the same boat, had gold, silver and bitcoins.
sold the gold and silver and currently own more bitcoin than before i was laid off :)
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:48:34
that's a classic signet ring style, any input on what you think would be better?
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:33:29
I don't think it is about how bitcoin will change these kinds of problems, but more how bitcoin is now going to be facing off against these same criminals in pin stripe suites. They are corrupt and will attempt to destroy bitcoin at every turn and this article sheds some light on what we are up against.
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:01:23
what a story. To all you would be assholes, remember karma is a bitch.
@_date: 2014-10-18 11:20:55
trolls feed off the reactions and you just laid out a feast, congrats
@_date: 2014-11-26 10:35:06
how dare you speak sensibly
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:54:15
I agree with you on all points but to have something like bitcoin that chips away at their power, however small, has to be encouraged and protected.

Governments have been working for some time now to create a cashless society and create high levels of trace-ability and accountability. At the very same time that governments are fine tuning the AML laws and cracking down on offshore tax havens, bitcoin is attempting to move to the next phase. These guys are basically saying it is not going to happen without regulation, which is fair enough if you are talking about taking bitcoin mainstream. You are going to need these guys on side, not working against you. 
It is interesting to note the general enthusiasm for blockchain itself too, but I can't imagine those guys wanting that kind of transparency.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:36:18
It's the closest we have to a digital version of cash. BTC doesn't need to go through special clearing houses and can be exchanged at the street level, globally. It can be as anonymous as you want it to be and as much as they try to persuade you that it is, it is not such a bad thing to have.

just spoke with AU team, no plans to implement in the near future unfortunately.
Looks like it is up to the americans to show Dell it is a successful decision

Sounds like you been at it for awhile then and commend your efforts. However the website from the facebook images take me to a drupal install with no content, this itself made me unsure about your product but the idea itself seems cool.

All you can do is advise, but don't lecture, everyone hates that.
Just remember to rub it in though when they realize that they have missed the boat, they hate that too but I'm sure you won't.
@_date: 2014-11-26 12:38:47
mate I could not care less about you or that shit stain part of the world you come from and really do not care what further crap dribbles out of your brain and onto these pages. I tried to to read some of your comment history but the level of verbal diarrhea was too much for 1 man to bare, so sorry I cannot partake in this pointless repartee with you any longer.
Challenge you? First I would need the challenge.

Platinum is a premium but shouldn't need to be so high without a brick s and mortar store front. I lost my job to overseas outsourcing so I have no problems undercutting their margins.

I dream of a day when all fiat will be pegged to BTC.
but seriously if US dollar lost it's throne, there will always be another currency to be the benchmark, whether BTC or RMB or AU.

Bitcoin is crashing, here is why I think it's a good thing.

Correct me if I am wrong but of course they are allowed to, however if your smsf does not make an income then you are eating into it's value year by year to cover the expenses.

ok you got me wanting to go into the workshop now and make 1 up ( and work out full costs) but I am guesstimating around 1.5 btc for 18 carat

a bit like kurdistan will never exist?
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:44:06
Too many people with shiny new dell computers? 
With all these new opportunities to buy with BTC, it is outweighing the new people coming into the market. Why would you convert fiat to btc just to buy something?
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:52:02
thank you for the file :) I just recently invested in a dlp printer but looking into a laser engraving setup at some stage (hopefully soon).
Any recommendations?

platinum is another story, i would say around the 2 btc mark

Nothing to see here, it is business as usual.
I just hope all those businesses  accepting bitcoin also keep a little aside, as the buyers re-enter and drive price back up again. 
IMHO to kick start the price to further highs, we need to do away with current business model of how bitcoin is purchased and become more dynamic.
All this jumping through hoops to move from the legacy model "BANKS" to the digital age is crippling uptake on the consumer side.
