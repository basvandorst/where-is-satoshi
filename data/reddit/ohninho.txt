For what it's worth I don't think religion bestows any special goodness on people and ethics and morality can be viewed many ways. Though I'd definitely feel more than a tinge of guilt that I'm taking other people's money. 
Would I do it? Probably not and I can admit it's because of the legality rather than the ethics. If you get caught you are fucked for an unknown amount of money.

This seems incredibly unethical and potentially illegal.

Exactly, in reality things like bitcoin that increase electricity demand are eating up the renewables that are coming online and maintaining a reliance on conventional generation. 
It's like taking a step forward only to instantly take another back.

"something will happen"- great info to have in my war chest

People speaking with confidence on things have absolutely no knowledge of is what's wrong with this sub. I have no issues telling these people to fuck off
I am interested in cryptocurrency and hold some assets in a few of them including bitcoin. But you guys are totally delusional here, simple as that.
And good job avoiding the point by the way :)

Oh fuck off. There are huge incentives and subsidies in place across the world for renewables and carbon taxes for conventional generation.
As renewables become cheaper and the problems they solve become more manageable renewables will move to 100% of energy production by 2100.
1MWH from wind where I work costs €80, Solar is €125 and conventional plant is around €35. Please do not believe the propaganda you see on reddit. 
Right now producing reliable electricity at affordable prices means we can't just go 100% renewable.
Bitcoin is creating a monstrous load, that will be picked up by existing generation be it renewable or conventional. Indeed most likely now conventional plants will turn on or up to deal with the extra crypto mining load, as renewables generally left to run at full output.
Renewables will change the world but it will take several decades and has nothing to do with crypto.

Haha, you're upset because I've come down on you like a tonne of bricks for being a moron. 
Please refrain from talking as if you have any understanding of power systems and the integration of renewables in future.

People are mining for profit. Otherwise they wouldn't be mining. Given the recent rise in value,it would seem safe to say they are mininh 1BTC for comfortably below $10,000.

Why would I be shilling against something I have invested in significantly? The paranoia is insane. Anything that is not glowing praise means I'm a shill? 
I don't care if you think I'm an asshole. You have to be realistic about what you're involved in and not get caught up in the enthusiasm and wishful thinking, which seems to be the only allowable perspective here. 
The reality is Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly, no matter how much we want it to be green and how marketable that would be, it is the opposite. It's the same as 3 million people leaving electric heaters run all day full blast right now, imagine that with mass adoption?

They don't get free electricity. They pay huge power bills, that will cover a large portion of their income.
