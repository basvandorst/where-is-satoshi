Because its all tracked on the blockchain. Every single transaction that leaves that wallet has a record. Just use a program to follow each one. Why wouldnt that be doable?
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:02:51
Very interesting. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:05:41
Ahh, I understand what you mean. Good question, im not sure either how that would work. The problem is, he needs to control all the addresses hes sending coins to. To have 100,000 addresses all with bitcoins in them, you would need a substantial amount of bitcoins to 'hide' them. And the only way to do so would likely be to create the addresses and send bitcoin to them yourself, meaning the attacker is still the one in control of the new wallets. Meaning yes those wallets are dirty. How could he possibly obfuscate that much bitcoin. I dont see how its doable.

All of the names of the tools in this leak were revealed in previous leaks. Theres very little "new" stuff in this leak, so in my opinion its easily faked.

Oh come on, nobody believes the whole "DPR isnt ross" tale. It was a convenient way to try and get off the trial convictions, but its silly.

How has bitcoin not taken off? It has billions invested into the idea. Not to mention it's a household name now. Sorry it hasn't replaced fiat, but I consider it to have taken off.

I'm including money invested in startups.

Honestly, backblaze is considered pretty cheap stuff in the field of storage, but yes you are correct. Its quite impossible in todays market.
Its not possible to fit 5P in one rack. 2P, sure. 5? No. 
And if you were to build a rack using 10T drives (which apparently are an existing concept), things like garbage collecting or balancing, or resilvering would be hilariously slow.

Funny since the advice I usually hear is "only keep money in crypto that you are willing to lose"

It happened 2 years ago when they accused Dorian

Where can I get a rundown on the way this works technically? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:29:02
It reminds me of the scene in wolf of wall street where they have to tape the money onto the peoples bodies to get it across the border. If they had bitcoins it would have been painfully simple.
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:44:15
One of the main downsides to bitcoin in my opinion. My credit card gets hacked? The company takes care of it all. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:28:13
He posted less than a year ago in his p2p account saying he was not Dorian Nakamoto. So he isn't dead and he is watching our moves.

For the average consumer its usually close to free? I put my money in a bank, its pretty secure.
@_date: 2016-06-25 22:34:05
Bitcoin absolutely beats other currencies in certain areas, but falls flat on its face in others. Its simply not a convenient currency to use at this time. Its risky, complicated, and has major problems that will prevent it from becoming a true competitor to credit cards, or cash. For now. Hopefully these can be resolved.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:03:11
Ya that wasn't a fun day. It's kind of surreal to think about how back then I only lost a few hundred dollars worth. But if I still had those coins now....
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:59:01
LMFAO good luck dude. No chance in hell. Actually, ill bet you 1 bitcoin at the end of 2017 you are wrong.

Ahhh yes, right when I sold.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:05:04
Whoa, its almost like people enjoy fun things! Crazy man!
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:37:24
Nope, I actually swore off putting any significant money into it for probably 4 years now. In my eyes I already missed the real payday of getting in really early, and its all just as risky as some stocks on the regular stock market now, id rather invest safely using known strategies there. Crypto is far too volatile for me at this point in my life where I cant afford to lose the money. I cant risk my investments dropping to like half their value when this bubble pops.
But ill probably buy back in when it does pop :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:41:28
The fact is that most people who bought bitcoin early on sold when they had their first big bump to like 300 bucks. Nobody could have expected the price it is now and its incredibly tempting to just cash out once youve made a moderate profit. Myself included. I regret not holding but I also was able to buy me and my mates beer for weeks off that initial investment so I felt like a winner at the time. If only I knew I could have had like 100k now I would have held of course, but I feel like most people have a similar story to me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:00:01
Hooo boy it was a process. Had to sign up for dwolla, add money there, and then buy on mtgox. It generally took over a week to get everything verified back then.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:43:14
Horseshit your cpu makes any sort of a profit. Cpu mining hasnt been profitable for many years.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:38:24
Yep, I started buying bitcoin in 2011 also when they were like 7 bucks. Sold about 50 of them the first time they had a decent bump (maybe 50 dollars? Idk). I was in college so it bought us beer for a week and I felt like a genius. Ive bought and sold probably 100 bitcoin over the years also but never just fucking held. Needless to say I want to kill myself.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:25:52
Considering were on the btc subreddit, in a thread about btc mining, its a little misleading to say you cpu mine profitably without specifying
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:50:15
I realize the title is a little misleading but its not wrong. He is a "bitcoin CEO". He isnt the CEO of bitcoin, but he is a CEO of a bitcoin company. Aka a bitcoin CEO.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:45:48
It comes down purely to risk analysis. Holding a few hundred dollar worth? Whatever, keep them on coinbase. Its unlikely anything will happen. Thousands? Use Electrum or a hardware wallet. Nobody thought MTGox was going to shit the bed and lots of people lost a lot of money (myself included). If something ever did happen, you will be protected.
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:59:41
Please post pics of your lambo
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:50:40
Yea I lost money in the Gox hack. At the time it was worth little enough to just shrug it off. Now I'm mad that I'm not buying a lambo with it.

There used to be a tor site called "bitcoin faucet" that would just give you free bitcoin if you visited. I wonder what the guy who made that is doing now.

Hello. Has this been made available yet?
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:57:23
Thank you for the response, though that doesnt really answer what I'm looking for. Open source means the code should be publicly available and viewable. Not a program people can use, but the actual code. The Bitfi website and you are claiming the code is open source but it doesnt seem to exist anywhere.

Can you explain how his opsec was shitty? He ran the site for several years and only got caught because of a misstep in the very early days. How else is he supposed to administrate the site if he doesnt log into it as an admin? None of what you are saying makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:15:57
I think this is an entirely different case. Dorian was being harassed and wanted nothing to do with this whole situation. He was an innocent casualty in this. Craig wants this publicity, he wants people to think hes Satoshi, Dorian didnt.

I dont get this, how would he ever expect to get away with this. Its OBVIOUS fraud, its just too stupid to assume that he could somehow walk away with all the investors money. There has to be a deeper story. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 01:43:31
I havn't been into bitcoin lately but 2 years ago or so coinbase was what everyone on reddit used. It was like a godsend after the dwolla mtgox days. What does everyone use now?

So how do I get my fucking bitcoins back when this prick is found guilty?
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:43:07
That's not conducive to a mass population adopting a currency. Your average Joe doesn't want to learn about encryption. And they shouldn't have to.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:21:42
At this point hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost due to hackers. How is this not bitcoins biggest issue right now? If a bank lost many thousands of dollars of my money, the government would step in.

That fake video that floated around the video a while back?
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:55:35
You're deluded if you think the general population is going to go for that. 80 percent of people dont know how to use computers without getting a virus every week. To think they will properly implement cold storage or encryption is silly.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:19:15
Did you even read the headline? He's not talking about satoshis motivations for creating btc.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:21:11
Hell, if I knew it had that many of drop some cash to build a computer to crack it as fast as possible.
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:51:10
Semantics. You know what I meant. Kickstarter popularised crowdfunding.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:44:13
I would say this is very unlikely. I would say he doesnt want bitcoin to have a face and a name. He doesnt want to be a jullian assange. He wants it to be his own thing. I think he just doesnt want to be associated with bitcoin even though he created it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:45:21
Thats you. Hes likely an older gentlemen, possibly with a wife and kids. Possibly a school professor and maybe at a prestigious school given how brilliant he clearly is. It would bring an incredible amount of unwanted attention to him.

@_date: 2013-12-12 23:36:05
He slowed his response rate down from forums, then to just with several bitcoin supporters, to just communication with one guy privately, and then gone. Its not like he was an active member of a community and then just dropped off the face of the earth. Although it is weird he cut communications so suddenly instead of saying goodbye. 
Also to add to my previous response. Its likely Satoshi is in the educational industry or atleast a very intelligent worker for a company. Would you want to be the face of a very very controversial software if you had to put your job and reputation at risk? Its likely he knew the potential his currency had for elicit activity. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:40:01

Im kicking myself now.
@_date: 2013-09-19 20:38:31
Anyone else intrigued by the idea of a kickstarter for hacks?
@_date: 2013-07-29 02:55:31
Listen I appreciate the fact that you have a site with a cool bitcoin funded product, but this is kinda spammy. Let the mods decide I guess.
@_date: 2013-08-29 15:58:33
What website is this?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:21:34
I bought and sold bitcoins long ago when it was less than 10 for 1.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:24:05
First off, the fact that he used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Many people have concluded that he was likely not Japanese as his name suggests based off the way he talks and times in which his posts were made (many people think british). This indicated he was trying to mask his anonymity. Why would someone do that unless they didnt want to be known?  Also people dont "just die". Unless he was hit by a car or something. He didnt die from sickness. And if he did wouldnt you assume a close relative of his would have said something? Also he said he was moving on to work on other things in his postings. If you read through his posts he makes it clear he doesnt want to be known.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:02:16
Same here. Seems intermittent. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:35:41
I meant developing a separate website. I know kickstarter would never allow it.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:26:48
I bought around 150 BTC back in the day. Lost the wallet. Oh well.
