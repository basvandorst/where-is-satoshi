Comes up fine in my chrome?
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:33:51
Absolutely, I know we can save you at least $100-$200 a month since you have more then 5 seats.
If you PM your details I could send you a formal quote.
@_date: 2015-06-05 02:09:01
Sweet! Yeah for low volume diy calling they're pretty great.

They're also a voip service, but they don't include a pbx and also charge for extra DID's.
We can beat their price by offering 0.90/month and .009/min but it would also be a stripped down version that matches their limited features. We enjoy making voip easy.
Our primary focus is flat rate unlimited service, with personal support, and all enterprise features without additional addon costs.
I think voip.ms would be a cool solution to anyone comfortable building their own pbx and working with sip and a general hands on approach.

We can connect customers globally. Anywhere the internet exist, we can service.
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:50:34
You forgot the /s!
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:34:56
Dang, beat us to the line! hm... maybe we're the first to offer Office 365 for bitcoin? :)

We definitely have sms, we also have some pretty awesome new call convergence technologies for cellphone integration. If you're interested we can setup a call/email with our sales engineer. Sales
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:59:38
One of the cool things with our technology is that we've made a huge leap in call quality. We license codecs that can handle some pretty junky connections, it took us quiet a bit of testing vs our competitors to break though this hurdle. We're hoping it's one of the aspects that sets us apart from everyone else.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:22:51
Awesome question. That is possible! Since it connects to coinbase you can set a wallet for payment, put in your amount to hold and let it auto pay from that pool. Or manually pay each month... or we can prepay for the year. We can setup billing anyway you'd like, let us know the best way for you and we'll make it happen!
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:02:07
I absolutely agree with this statement.
For us it's supporting the payment methods our customers want. If even one customer requests a payment method, we'll put our best efforts forward to accept it.
If someone wanted to trade us shoes for phone service, we'd find a way to make it happen for them! That's our primary focus, customer service.
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:55:50
Since we'd be porting numbers and setting up fax, it'd be best if we set the project up via email/phone and move forward from there!
Can you email us: sales and we'll contact you tomorrow? (the response from this community has been overwhelming!)
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:53:24
There are definitely some cool companies out there. The DIY companies are pretty interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:38:59
Management wanted to see demand before investing in paying our devs to do the integration (since our devs aren't cheap!)
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:27:47
I feel like bitcoin might make that easier? Dealing with fee's from the CC companies is painful and expensive.
One way we've reduced chargebacks is with flat rate unlimited pricing.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:33:46
Great questions. I had a PM with similar questions so I'll answer here.
1) We're a VOIP provider, skype for business comes as part of our business Office 365 offering. The two services are separate.
2) We are currently are only servicing customers in the US. Customer privacy is a primary concern. We don't share customer information with anyone outside the required federal communication laws.
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:25:18
Yes, we absolutely do offer LNP, the carriers are becoming more standardized so it's now less painful to transfer service.
It's nearly 10:30 here. I'll let management know there is interest in the bitcoin community. Thanks for the comment!
@_date: 2015-05-05 04:53:34
We offer plans built to fit anyway you like.
Most customers choose our unlimited plans and pay per seat. We're very flexible to customer needs.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:34:41
As of this morning, things are looking positive!
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:34:21
You're right! This is day one for us, our initial scouting, and we're all somewhat new.
We'd love to be your provider!
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:15:19
We're located about 20 miles west of the new Tesla Gigafactory in Reno, NV!
We prematurely put the bitcoin logo on our website but we haven't built in the integration yet. I think if we can get 5 interested customers together it would be worth integrating. I've already received 3 other PM's so I'll pass this information along to management tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:29:48
Our pricing is flexible. We try our best to provide Unlimited plans, but in a similar business model republicwireless, we need to make sure the customer is the right fit.
Also there are situations where people need more seats and less lines, high compression codecs, and other variables.
We're a small 5 person company. We try our best to get each seat to be unlimited phone for as low as $15 a month (if they have great quality internet, low jitter and latency).
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:20:45
We're still a small company. 5 employees working hard together. We'll get there soon, we promise!
One of the biggest hurdles is building out all the automation. It's great fun and we enjoy it, but the api's take time to integrate. Also procedure writing and support services take time to get spot on, so we're working hard in that area as well.
We want to stand out in price and customer service. For the moment, that means we'll have to have an old fashioned talk :)
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:39:20
Just doing our part if it works out!
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:45:49
Sorry about that, our web dev and marketing guy are uploading the final draft today. We haven't advertised it until recently. Our starting client base was existing cloud services customers. Now that we're established we're making our first reach!
@_date: 2015-05-05 04:55:27
That's what we are afraid of. We'd like to plan our projects around hard data. Currently 99% of our customers pay by some form of CC.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:42:39
We do provide a sip gateway.
Sorry, the site is lagging behind, our web dev and marketing guy is working on finishing it up today.
@_date: 2015-05-05 04:57:14
That's great news. We'd love to talk more... if we find enough interest, we'll put together a follow up list and reach out to potential customers after we're ready to accept bitcoin.
Thank you for the comment.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:50:13
We did get clearance this morning to manually process bitcoin transactions. If you'd like we can have a sales engineer work with you on processing an order!
