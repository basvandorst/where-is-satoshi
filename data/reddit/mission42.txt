You should research more first. Go Google BCC vs. BTC and realize the misake you made on bitcoin.com

Until it doesn't.

Shorting is buying a contract that is letting you sell x number of shares for the value now and you will give the shares back in a set amount of days at that days current value. You're say borrowing 10 bitcoin and selling now at 14k or whatever and in a week you will buy back those 10 to give to who sold you the contract and hopefully the value of bitcoin is now less than the original price of 14k so you make a profit. 
When you do it on stocks 1 contract is generally 100 shares and you just deal with the premiums. Often you'd sell the contract before it expires unless it's ITM or you are long and want the shares still.
Selling on the way down and rebuying is not shorting.

Angry much?
I'm not saying your net is less after taxes. Of course it's a good deal if the risk factor was 0. Since any investment with a decent return also has a risk factor associated with it, especially bitcoin, then you have to factor that in as well. The risk along with the nearly 40% capital gains loss is a big decision to make when deciding to diversify or invest in bitcoin. 
Many new people here just see it shooting up quick and want to get on for the ride.  Most likely they've missed the big gains and they are going to be left holding the bag when all is said and done. At the end of the day people here are spending $10k on 1 imaginary number. Could it pay off for them? Maybe. Most likely, no.

Balked at $800 but you think $17,500 now is a good deal?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:42
Ok. Never has happened...yet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:37
You can buy fractions of a share though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:49
Not sure when you bought in but don't forget about the short term gains if less than a year ago, which I'm going to assume it was.

Sell before futures trading gets very far in. The big banks and whales will be manipulating this and buying up the shorts then sell all together to drive the price down.

I'm a firm believer of researching before investing. A few Google searches about what BCC or BCH is vs BTC and "is bitcoin.com legitimate to buy bitcoin from" would have yielded a lot of information. Instead they heard about bitcoin making big gains and jumped in without much knowledge. Is it there fault bitcoin.com is a shady front for bitcoin cash? No. However, a little due diligence where their money is going would have helped. Otherwise if they didn't fully understand the investment then I don't suggest making it.
Hopefully it was a small price paid for a good lesson learned.

It's going to be able to be shorted soon on the market. Watch out for the manipulators and whales. They've been playing this game for a long time, don't think they can't run a pump and dump on bitcoin too. 
Amazing how it's taken 6 plus years and then this year it exploded, especially the last month or so with the run up to hitting the stock market. Kinda seems like some people are manipulating the price up getting a bunch of new people on board that knew nothing about bitcoin until a couple months ago and only see these gains. Then Sunday hits and the whales start buying shorts for a bit then all sell off at the same time to drive the prices down and make a load of money on the way down as well.
This spike bitcoin has been on lately is ridiculous if for no other reason than manipulation. People are jumping in for fear of losing some speculative gains and instead are going to be left with the empty bag which is exactly what the big players want.  Don't think big bankers and investors who have been doing this stuff for decades don't know exactly how to manipulate an unregulated market and scam some people that have been "invested" in bitcoin for a few months or even less out of their money.  
This "HODL" mentality is something else around here when people are buying in at 12k, 13k, 14k.  Bitcoin isn't viable as it sits now for worldwide adoption as a currency. It can not and will not at this level be anymore than a speculative tool. Transactions are not seconds like many claim, fees are climbing unless you wait which is the opposite of what anyone wants from a digital currency, and the swings are so wild it's tough to accept as a payment option, places that do aren't HODLing either, they are getting their dollars back out as quick as possible.
Just be careful bro, don't be stuck holding the bag when it all comes crashing down. At least get your initial investment back out if you've made a decent profit and if you have debt get out what you can to pay that off too. Then gamble the rest away but know the odds aren't in your favor. Big banks will win, the rich will get richer and the rest of us will stay in our place.

Research a pump and dump and the futures market. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:39:44
Yes, this is what the whales call the pump. They get people who know nothing to invest their money based on hype then when the futures start they short the hell out of it and sell their coins collectively.  This causes panic from the new buyers who are buying at ATH and don't understand bitcoin in the least (probably heard about it from big bang theory or at thanksgiving dinner) and they sell quickly to save any bit of their money that they can. The price keeps dropping and more and more people panic sell instead of "HODL". The whales take all the money from the shorts and then rebuy together at a very decreased cost, then rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:58:45
Read about investments before investing. Futures trading starts tomorrow, everyone thinks whales drove the price up, will buy shorts tomorrow, sell off a ton of coins to drive the price down, profit on the shorts, then rebuy the coins on the rebound.

It's always best to research any type of investment before you actually do it. Also learn how the stock market works and some history of it. Research the tech behind bitcoin and see if you actually think it is a good choice or you just bought in because it was going up.

Preach brother, preach!

Who thought that? Trump is a rich business owner with only intentions to cut cost for big business and lower taxes. I never heard anyone who thought Trump would be bad for the market.

Short term capital gains can be almost 40%. I wouldn't call that small by any means. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:57:10
What do you mean lost? He can't recover it and put it back in a bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:33:00
Or a bagholder. One or the other. Good luck!

I don't know why you asked me but no probably not in 1 transaction. Coinbase limits to 10k unless you provide license and a webcam picture/video to verify identity then they will raise the limit but not to a million plus. That said over a course of a few weeks he could easily sell it and get the money. Or possibly do an off network transaction and have the money sooner if he can find a buyer.
