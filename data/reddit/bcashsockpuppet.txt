The target is way too high. 50000 not more.

Yes, you can move your coins from segwit to legacy, legacy to segwit and segwit to segwit.

I just checked his history. He surely was outspoken and got a lot of hate, but it seems real. And as far I can see, he only responded harshly, if he was attacked.

SegWit is supported by the core client. Do you really think, exchanges use the graphical wallet?
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:04:57
It's just a list of current developments. Why do you think, it's positive?

He wasn't sentenced for buying fireworks, he was sentenced to sell and store it illegally. That's a different story. 
I don't know, if he simply didn't know about the laws or if he intentionally ignored them.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:39:22
Lots of reasonable people expected this.
It's still a shame, that so many services making good money with Bitcoin don't support segwit in their products, especially after the release of bitcoin 0.16, which made the transition way easier.
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:37:14
You got me ;-)  
I wasn't aware, that it isn't allowed.

Todays Bakkt volume might represent about 5% of total volume and Bakkt barely started especially if one compares the volume to other market segments.

Maybe still good entry prices. Who knows.

I could even live with a little bit of shitcoin attitude.
Bitcoin without Twitter would be great. Hero worship and the subconscious urge to get a quick endorphins kick are all over the place.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:09:38
A person like Andreas with tighter ties to Core would be a great.

There is not always a need to keep many connections alive. It depends on your use case. It might be ok to just download mined blocks one time every hour and ignore the mempool. If you expect an incoming payment, you start the app and it will sync the missing it in a matter of seconds.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:46:07
Sorry for the late answer.
I get your sentiment, my only reply here is, that these people will lose Bitcoin either way.  
I just don't believe that distributing your money on dozens of use case specific apps has a lot of drawbacks. The most obvious is, that the user needs to manage his funds in the apps. It would drive me crazy.  
If you insist on standalone apps a compromise could be a standardized wallet API that is easy to integrate in third party apps like the before mentioned tipping app
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:39:50
Does the GUI version of Eclair support custom third party plugins? Is it possible to write a tipping app inside Eclair?

It's a slippery slope in my opinion. Especially as the arguments used are almost identical then those fake  arguments against Bitcoin like drugs, cp, arms, terrorism and what  not.  
If they get a majority vote with this weak argumentation, it could encourage them to try it with Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:03:29
Nothing wrong. It just made me thinking, as their argumentation can 1:1 be used for a law on banning Bitcoin or privacy coins.  
An outright ban is still a risk and I think it's imperative to oppose such proposed policy changes in quite similar fields like Tor.   
And it directly affects the way I run my Lightning and Bitcoin nodes. I would be considered a criminal just be running it over Tor.
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:59:43
Yes. It's a shortened version, but there are already some proposals injected into the parlamentary system.  
It's not clear yet, if they get enough votes.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:15:24
I agree that it increases the attack vector massively. Nevertheless as long as the user is aware of the increased risk and is willed to accept to trade security for comfort I am fine with it.
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:57:25
In my opinion it's important to tell your representative  your opinion. Small scale lobbying is powerful
@_date: 2019-04-04 16:53:20
It will be enforced on a case by case basis  and the  one, who just want to protect their privacy  will  be treated  as criminals.  
Out of fear many legit users will just not risk it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:10:25
Still you would always risk to get catched if your opsec isn't perfect. Wouldn't that harm adoption?
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:56:14
"Günter Krings, the Parliamentary State Secretary of the Federal Ministry  of the Interior, demanded during the opening ceremony that the use of  the Tor browser be forbidden in the union."
Sounds like a ban to me, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:49:38
My main concern is this the maturity of the current implementations. If the trend continues, we will surely observe some implementations failures, like routing information spam, inefficient path finding algorithms and what not.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:56:16
That's a scam. CSW is Satoshi, not Greg!

In my understanding BetterHash allows individual miners to decide which transactions go into a block. So in case of a re-org the attacker would not only need to bribe a few mining pool operators, but also all individual miners.
