Absolutely, my numbers were just a demonstration of the dual sided effect.

It hit me when I saw a Toyota carols ad. A car I bought new in 2013. The car has had major upgrades in tech and fuel efficiency,yet the newest version cost only slightly more than the one I bought 7 years ago.
To further this idea, I believe Tesla’s will experience massive deflation now that they are much closer to computers than cars. This is all great for consumers using fixed supply money ��

On a side note, corporations probably support this system as well, their wage costs are significantly reduced by these effects in real terms.

Correct, commodities and products should lower in price over time (deflation). Not to be confused with a deflationary currency where the money supply itself is shrinking. 
It’s the difference between products and commodities becoming less valuable, and money becoming more valuable.

Inflation is the amount of new money created. Full stop. 
How and when that results in higher prices is a whole different story.

That is another huge theft, by income and assets increasing only on a nominal basis, property and wages are taxed and taxed at higher rates with net losses of buying power.

The reason loans were made that way in the early 2000s was because of govt guaranteed loans and a push to “give everyone a chance at the American dream”
Cheap money was a factor to inflated prices of homes but just one of several

Crazier things have happened.

Appreciate it, to me the best way to look at USD is a medium of exchange only. Besides all of the restrictions of banking and financial services, USD is an amazing tool for trading in and out of assets. I suppose as long as these exchanges are done fairly quickly, there is little chance of loss in buying power. 
It’s the measuring of value in USD that throws everyone off. “It’s like making a measurement with inches that change length constantly. 
This is not standard unit of value I guess? Everything is in relation to everything else. 
Large implications of this “changing inch”
Income tax
Capital gains 
Loss recoup 
By measuring value in a shrinking inch, it crates massive miscalculations and unfairness, especially in taxes and wages.
