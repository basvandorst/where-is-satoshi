Isn't a public/private key simple free speech that anyone can create and use? Random numbers and letters that can be generated by anyone can't possibly be private property.

What if it could send all traffic through a VPN provider or tor? Not sure if that would be better or not for swat issue.

It is interesting that so many countries do not criminalize money laundering, then is it really a crime?

Definately turned off by the need for all private information to donate bitcoin. Seems that could be an influence that is not accounted for by this test.

By 'level playing field' Mastercard means for them and not for bitcoin.

If you really want to help the bees, then help the hobby/small bee keepers. Find a way for them to sell their surplus honey with bitcoin. 
Right now most people with 1-2 hives end up giving a lot of honey away. This is due the hassle to sell it through wholesalers (with minimums) and farmer markets with high cost fees and regulations.

Someone could hack a POS automatic change dispenser, that instead is a printer that will print the bitcoin pub/priv key with value of change on it. Maybe it could be a drop-in replacement for existing automatic change dispensers.

Example of how this is affecting bitcoin now for users with large holdings is..
Almost all of bitcoin's large holders and market makers from initial bitcoin success have faced fines and jail time.

Yes I like wifidog captive portal project it seems like minimal work to get it going to do auth with bitcoin. I think this package gets included in many downstream distro builds for custome router firmware, like in Buffalo Networks hardware wifi ap.

You could use a bitcoin address for the network name
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:08:41
I think as soon as you spend with any vendor your security needs increases beyond encrypting your key.
Since the transaction history can be traced easily that vendor will know you had at least X bitcoin from Y date.
What's to stop someone from demanding your private keys or your life? 
Insurance could allow someone to recover stolen funds and proper security could prevent that from the start.
edit: clarify question

There are many ways to value bitcoin, his method seems like the way to arrive at the lowest possible value of BTC.
I think one has to consider bitcoin as digital gold - it functions as both a payment mechaism and store of value. It's two sides to the same coin... can't have one without the other.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:17:18
Already 100s of altcoins, why not add govcoins. No doubt they will get hacked like many new coins and have the same problems as fiat.

Ripple = paypal of crypto. They have been there since the first bitcoin conference, trying to ride the coattails of bitcoin. Seems they are finding traction with the govcoin group.

1). Steal all the coins you can
2). Arrest anyone who had success in making the initial bitcoin market
3). Stifle innovation by conflicting regulations.
4). Make it very hard for consumers to buy bitcoin with fiat

It's possible the trust of the bitcoin core dev team can be lost and that would provide an opportunity for litecoin to benefit for wider adoption. I feel this is how LTC will go much higher than $50.

Just call it 'bits' for the amount that is before the decimal place. 
100 bits = 100 bitcoins or 100 mBTC or 100 uBTC

Pre-orders remind me of a saying:

Still no proof that they are mining with their own hardware.

Yes very trustworthy, they refunded my BTC after I canceled my order but had already sent the BTC... no problems.

I'll buy it when 1 BTC = $1,000,000

Maybe this is the first sign that pre-orders are dead?
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:09:16
No one can predict the future and mining hardware may have value beyond the basic block reward calculations many use.
