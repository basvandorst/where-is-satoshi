So I essentially have to wait until it goes through and then sell back through coinbase when the tranaction goes through? Is that what the case is right now?

Couldn't get them to validate my Driver's License so I went the other route because I didn't know it would take longer. Live and learn I suppose!

So if I bought bitcoin through my bank account (Not using the Credit / Debit option) - As in, I did not add money to my wallet, I actually bought it. I will have to wait 7 days until I can sell?
There is no way I can sell the same amount I invested now to undo the position I just put myself in?

I bought some bitcoin through Coinbase. I set it up to go through as an ACH from my checking account (Not the credit or debit card option because I couldn't get my ID to verify). I thought I was adding money to my wallet but ended up actually buying the amount of bit coin. But since it is an ACH it says it will process in 7 days. It says I can't cancel but I wanted to know if there is a way through Coinbase to short the asset (I think that's what it is called?) and just undo my position? But I don't know how to do that or if its an option.
I am technically up right now since I bought in which is a saving grace. But I didn't want to take such a big step in initially and I would like to have flexibility to get out of my position before 7 days. Any help or guidance you can provide to get out of my position earlier? Sorry for such the obviously noob questions!
EDIT: issue --&gt; option

1) How do you move bitcoin through exchanges.
2) If I put a stop payment at my bank on this transaction (since it was through my bank account not the debit / credit card option) will that stop it? Is that even an option? What would happen there?
3) You're last sentence, can you explain more on that to a noob?

Because I am a noob. Sorry. I usually lurk, sorry for the unnecessary link!

That's why I did it, didn't know if I just missed the text post option somehow.
