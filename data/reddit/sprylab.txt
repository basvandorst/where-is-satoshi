Thanks so much for coming to see us! For everybody else, we sell all locally sourced food, online at freshfully.com and out of our market in Birmingham. We sell pastured beef, pork, lamb, and goat, in-season produce, local cheese and milk, farm eggs, and pantry goods. We also serve lunch and starting Tuesday, breakfast and brunch. We ship. We love our customers. No request too large or small.

I'd love to have one in my business in Birmingham, AL. We would really appreciate it here!

Oh yeah, thanks! Now to figure out how to do that...

Thanks y'all! We are a local-food seller (grass-fed meat, pantry stuff, local produce) in Birmingham, AL. We also have a little lunch cafe and do brunch on the weekends. 
We sell things like CSA boxes and meat boxes online at freshfully.com. We have an awkward workaround on our site at the moment, where you add items to cart, use the coupon code **bitcoin** to complete your order, and then send the funds. You can subtract the 3% yourself. 
We are happy to ship food, including items not listed online like the legendary [Benton's bacon]( Alabama gift baskets, McEwen's organic blue grits, and Dreamland BBQ Sauce. 
If we're shipping something to you, no need to send funds yet. We'll email you the total with shipping. Props to who sent 10 rounds of fresh veggie boxes to a local food bank!
We're at 200 41st Street S, Birmingham, AL 35222.

2 pounds, not 2 dollars ;)

We watch for the verification email on our phones, which happens really fast, and keep the customer engaged while we wait.

Hey Torchius, this is us, and we're not far from Irondale. We're just in Avondale.

There's an update here, unrelated to this post. We're actually having to close our store. I hope to bring you info on the next one! 
P.S. I just wanted to say why it is we chose to accept bitcoin. For me, it's the only viable way to correct the problem of income inequality. Miners are doing god's work. Mine on!
