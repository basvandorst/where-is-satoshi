Hey, isn't Gandhi the guy that ordered hitmen to kill his enemies?

Gold is used in electronics manufacturing to coat connectors that may be exposed to the air, to prevent corrosion.

The network can't even clear transactions in a useful amount of time, how do you expect businesses to start accepting Bitcoin for day-to-day stuff?
Should people wait in line at a grocery store for 8 hours to buy bread and milk?

Produce with what tools? How do you buy the equipment and raw materials to set up this infrastructure when your country currently produces nothing and has almost no natural resources? By using a weak-ass currency?
And when you say "quickly", what timespan are you talking about? 5 years? 10 years? 20?
And what exactly do you propose they produce?

And in the meanwhile people starve? How do you propose the tourism industry be propped up in a country that can't feed itself, let alone the tourists that come over to visit?
Who are these investors you speak of? Do you have any concrete idea of what companies would be interested in setting up agricultural explorations in Greece?

Until it is, there is no point suggesting that bitcoin can solve these people's problems.

Or simply the 3 largest pool owners colluding.

I'm not quite sure I understand your comment. Do you think that the Euro is a "greek" currency? If the greeks leave the Euro Zone then everything will be turned into drachmas?

Apples and oranges.
Iceland is practically independent energy-wise, it only imports oil and gas because it can't produce any of its own.
It also has a large aluminum mining and processing infrastructure set up, among many other exports.
They also have a relatively small population to support: about ~320K versus Greece's ~11M.
Iceland pulled through because they could devalue their currency to increase exports, but that was possible because they have a strong industry in the first place. 
Greece going back to the Drachma won't help them because they produce almost nothing to export!

Again, Iceland has the means to hoist itself out of a rut which Greece simply does not.
You people keep saying Greece should just go back to the drachma and everything will be fine, but just hand-wave when asked exactly how they're going to accomplish this having no natural resources or industry to build upon said resources.
Either way it doesn't really matter; what you are really interested in is using Greece's suffering as a way to pump your particular brand of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:07:00


Not really. The reason why this is so bad for Greece is because they produce almost nothing compared to other Euro Zone countries.
Going back to a nacional currency that they can use to boost exports won't help much because they export almost nothing!
This is not remotely same for the other countries in dire straits at the moment (Portugal, Italy, Spain), let alone the rest of the Euro Zone!

This sounds like a really sensible solution to the problem of censorship and monopolization of subreddits, because there is nothing preventing the same things from (re)occuring on Voat or other Reddit alternatives.
But I think you're probably not going to get much support on this subreddit. Folks here worship the blockchain as if it were a magical solution to the world's problems. :|

Nope. Maybe some other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin isn't the end-all of currency, just like previous forms of currency also evolved over time.
Honestly, there are other alts that have already implemented improvements over bitcoin's original ideas but for some reason were never merged back into bitcoin. 
And in the end, who knows what other problems will exist? Bitcoin is an experiment, and if it doesn't work out as you hoped you shouldn't hang onto it like a religion.
