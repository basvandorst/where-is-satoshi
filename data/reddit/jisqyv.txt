bitaddress.org generates in your browser. The real risk is the printing path. If you at home, you are probably fine, but if you at work using a print server, many servers store images of print jobs, and your private key will hang out there...

They are being investigated by the State of New Jersey, which is pretty strange as they have no connection to New Jersey and the hackathon was not in New Jersey. In fact one of the legal issues is whether or not New Jersey can claim any jurisdiction at all!
Some Background: NJ busted a botnet ring that was using people's computers to mine (I'm not sure which coin, but it doesn't matter). I suspect that the New Jersey prosecutors believe that Tidbit is doing something similar. They have subpoenaed Tidbit's source code as well as demanded that the students answer some very pointed questions (as in if they answer in a given manner, they are admitted guilt).

Yep. Go to  and click on the "Security" Tab.

If you look the address up on the blockchain you will discover it only received one transaction for 0.2 BTC back last May. So its a nice try, but doesn't look like it has generated much business. (sigh).

Just don't use the Brainwallet feature. Brainwallets (really bitcoin addresses generated from a typed string) do not contain enough entropy. If you use a simple password as your Brainwallet, you will risk having your coin stolen in real time!

An approach might be to keep two different wallets. One wallet is where you keep your investment btc. The other is where you keep your operating btc. You can buy btc into your operating wallet near to when you will need it, so the price you purchase it at is likely close to the price you spend it at.
The fact that btc exists in "addresses" makes it easier to keep track of then stock.

This points out that you really want your wallet separate from a long running process that is managing the bitcoin network (aka bitcoind or bitcoin-qt).

Another thing to consider is never using the same address for more then one transaction. Money in (multiple times, no problem) but money out just once. Not only does this guard against the side channel attacks (by the time the attacker gets the key it is worthless, literally!) it also protects against other attacks against your public key. Before you spend funds not only is your private key private, but so is your public key. Your address is a double hash away from your key. So if I only have your address, I have to reverse two hashes and then I can start attacking your key.
Once you spend funds though, you reveal your public key in the block chain. But if you never use that key again, who cares.
