Like it or not, people trust banks, or most people do, they leave their money there and do alot of other important business trough them.
Visa and mastercard is only a small part of the whole thing and I think a sidechain on R3 will solve whatever issues they have, or not who knows.
Ledger or not, they see the blockchains potential and do what they always do, secure their positions and block change that would be harmful to them.
People on the street will never have any Idea of the difference between permissioned and permissionless blockchains. I does not matter to them, trust and security matters and the R3 will seem like it has both.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:34:34
I think that you are right that there would be alot of issues for them to overcome but when it comes to the banks and greed I would not put anything past them: They have realised the potential here and will definitively make a worthy effort.
I think getting a product ready today will be the smaller task, I think the details between the banks will be harder. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:25:38
I think they will be in competition, why would they not offer almost everything that the Bitcoin blockchain offers?
The safety will be the illusion that the consortiums efforts to secure the network will be better and more secure than the miners securing the bitcoin network.
I think they can make it safe enough but as long as the perception of safety for R3 is bigger than for the Blockchain, that is all that matters.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:21:00
Why wouldn't the R3 solve it as good or better than the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:19:33
Most people will have no clue of the difference between BTC and R3 than the difference the marketing and propaganda to them.
They just want to do their shit as friktionless as possible while grabbing a beer on the weekend, the do not have the same insight and disdain about the banking system that most people here does.
Why would people want to use R3? they don't care about R3
The banks will use it to make transfers cheaper for them and faster for the customer anyhwere in the world the customer will get most of the blockchain benefits without knowing why.
The banks will then create regulations that makes sure that use of another blockchain for the same purposes as they use it for will be impossble to comply to unless you are a big bank.
Hopefully Bitcoin will continue to exist in the perifery but I am sure the big banks will do everthing in their power to take over all the important functions of it and more. For a fee from the user ofcourse

If they were in bankruptcy that would be true which they are not but even if so, in this case that would be a very small portion since I don't think wages and environmental cleanup costs would be a large issue for GOX.

Classes of preferred creditors
Creditors who are characteristically preferred creditors are:
revenue authorities
in some countries, environmental clean-up costs
in some countries, tort victims[1]
In the United Kingdom employees are preferential creditors for their wages (subject to a statutory limit), as are occupational pension schemes. The right of the Crown as a preferential creditor was removed by the Enterprise Act 2002.

Maybe you don't fit your stereotypical image of the people here since you and your life must be soooo much better than the people you ridicule. 
Or maybe you should take a break from the reddit sub you despise so much and take a look in the mirror. 
Just because you feel superior doesn't mean that you are.

@_date: 2014-03-25 18:42:27
If it was true that the coins were gone he would have no option but to file for bankruptcy, but he filed for bankruptcy protection which was granted by the judge. 
This means that he has shown the judge that there is a possibility to continue the business, tarnished or not has no relevance. 
If all the coins were gone there would be NO way to continue the business and bankruptcy would be the only thing left.
This seems to fit now since they have confirmed the first find of 200K coins.
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:36:27
So I guess trolling would be an appropriate description?

Well, since there were fake accounts too with inflated balances it actually means that some of the missing coins must have been fake.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:17:08
It means that the 202K coins are to be distributed to less people than previously thought since there were fake accounts with inflated balances.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:51:00
I don't think that is a possibility however the coins were lost.
@_date: 2015-07-31 05:41:35
It is really not that difficult.
The 202K coins left are to be distributed to less people (accounts) than previously thought since there are fake accounts with inflated balances that will not partake in that distribution.

Bit-X has no FX fee, I have a card in Sweden and all I pay is flat fee of 0.002btc To Bit-X and 1% to the card issuer. 
I have checked my purchases and that are all the fees for store purchases.
@_date: 2015-09-06 07:09:03
I would go with Bit-X since they seem to have better fees. (flat fee 0.002btc) + 1% on purchase and NO exchange fee BTC to EUR/USD or any other currency.
Advcash has no fee on purchase but seem to take 10% exchange fee from BTC to EUR/USD
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:24:54
No reason to put that large sell up if you want to sell, looks like someone is bluffing.
@_date: 2015-09-09 15:51:59
If my USD card does not charge FX for SEK purchases, I doubt it would charge me for USD purchases.
They still would need the card pin or you could just keep a small BTC balance and refill the card when you have shopped it empty or withdraw the BTC at will.

If you use your brain instead of posting bullshit assumptions you may be able to figure out that of the over 120 000 active accounts in Mt Gox (before the shutdown), most will be transferred to Kraken with the claim amount and a large part of these will be active with Kraken.
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:17:45

@_date: 2015-02-07 18:01:44
Since I was expecting nothing, I would be difficult to dissapoint.
It seems however that the more information that comes out, the more it points to inflated balances in the compromised database and if that is true, the liabilities will likely decrease and the amounts returned to real verified customers will increase.

Yes it is. If it changes we will comply with the law.
We will always honor the drawings and you can verify this every week.
How to you verify a random number? BTC-L has developed a system to ensure that we don't cheat you. We take the last deposit, get the transaction id, then grab the time the block for when that transaction was created. This time is then verified with another service to ensure that the time is correct. Once that time is verified, it is converted to a unix timestamp and then the mod of that unix timestamp and the total number of tickets is found, and that is the winner. Here is what the code looks like
// Last Transaction ID for the Current Lottery (uncontrollable variable)
$txid = $lastTransaction["txid"];
//Get the time from BlockExplorer of this transaction
$blockexplorer = file_get_contents("
$time1 = strtotime(array_shift( explode(")",end(explode(" (", $blockexplorer, 2)))));
//Get the time from BlockChain of this transaction
$blockchain = file_get_contents("
$time2 = strtotime(array_shift( explode("  ",end(explode(" (", $blockchain, 2)))));
//Verify that the times match so that we have verification of time and neither sites were hacked
	//Get total number of tickets and get the modulus of the time
	$winnerTicket = $time1 % count($tickets);
This is completely secure in that that a block can not be manipulated by a single user and that the time is verified by two different entities. Once the winner is selected, the lottery account is closed so that no more transactions can be made to this account and so that the last transaction will always remain the same.

Sweden has done great job balancing socialism with capitalism and managed to build a society with a very healthy middle class, this is what have kept the country great for so long, much like America in the fifties. 
Now they have decided that we don't have it good enough and need to go full capitalism to get it SOOOOO much better. So we are pissing in the pants and are selling out energy health and elderly care and schools which for some reason just keep getting more and more expensive in private care and let's not talk abou quality.
Many Swedes realize that they have to put their kids in private schools in order to avoid getting harassed by gangs of immigrants.

If it was only the Romanians I guess we could manage but with the open borders to the least educable and most religiously indoctrinated (Islam of fucking course) people on the planet, we are in trouble. 
Somehow the idiots in charge of this place have decided that our culture is nonexistent an not worth preserving and ALL the other stone age Islamic cultures on the fucking planet have all the damn rights in the world ahead of the Swedes.
Mosques are poppin up all over the place where the indoctrination of the next generations can proceed uniterrupted. Separate bath times in swimminghalls, halal food, changes of law to favor immigrants, rebate for crimes ( the more you commit the better) 
We are also the rape capital of the world soon ( second now after Lesotho ) yippe!
Violent crimes and robbery of elderly has skyrocketed, I can go on forever but have to stop before I pop  vein and have to go to the emergency room, which have been refitted with more securityguards and security chambers to only let one person in at a time to prevent whole families of idiots to attack hospital staff because they are trying to do their job.

I lived in the US for about 14 years and I LOVE the people there, friendly helpful and generally awesome. Problem is that congress and the whole political system has been captured, infiltrated and held hostage by psychopaths from big industry. 
I believe that is what is happened here now too. The current admin is demantling the social safety net with the help of useful idiot in the name of political correctness. We will soon have so much unemployment ( yes, beacause of the immigration) and that will give them reason to sell out what is left of the commons and lower minimum the wage and workers rights ( to provide an entry as they call it to the workforce)
Soon enough we will have only Mcjobs for a lot of our Islamic friends and that will lead to even more segregation Islamization and hostility towards the Swedes Since we ofcourse already are the source of all their problems because of our  "racism"
Oh well, Just another country saved by the awesomeness of islam

I understand this and that is part of the problem.
The problem is that once the bitcoins has been transferred some assholes just take off without delivering the goods, there are plenty of examples here of this happening.
