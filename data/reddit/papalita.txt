@_date: 2017-12-15 06:44:45

I think you have never bought crypto with cc on an exchange. They ask for your selfie with the card you are holding and your passport.  So you can’t use stolen card on a crypto exchange.

Oh the people who cannot use google but can post same questions on Reddit over and over again. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:24:11
Your real life wallet can be stolen too. :) you are responsible for your assets digital or not.

Do not day trade on cex.io

I don’t think that will make a change. They don’t have limits for how many contracts one can make as long as one can back it. So mostly more volume less voltality will happen as we have seen this week. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:39:54
Sorry for misinformation I thought they both use average after seeing that talk. Maybe Gemini will make an average price for them rather they collect data and average it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:35:54
This can happen with credit cards too. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:14:20
I don’t understand why people post this kind of news here on reddit. These stupid idiotic ideas over and over again. To be insulted??
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:19:18
Actually they are using average. Andreas explained this on a talk.

They are just buying our buying/selling probabilities.

His bitcoins probably stolen because he installed jaxx chrome app on a compromised pc. 
Other than that if you keep your private key safe and don’t let people mass around with your phone(wich is jaxx installed I presume)you are safe. 
But if you really want to change your wallet 
Breadwallet &amp; Mycelium are cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:43:14
No they are saints.

Bitcoin is legit enough without nasdaq or any other futures market. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:25:48
You need to be able to sell that risky tab to another person with interest. Wrigh?
So your risky depth is not an asset as long as no one is buying. You need to stop thinking with the same depth centered monetary mind. Bitcoin is just a medium to read the real thing “the blockchain”. The blockchain keeps every private keys account. None other institution needed for that service.

This guy is obsessed with gambling not bitcoin. He is playing odds not investing in technology 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:42:20
Your math is wrong!!
Did you heard about difficulty adjustment ??? 
Block time never changes 10 min. The difficulty adjusts it self to maintain that time. More computing power increases diff. So the 10 min does not change. So you cannot mine faster.  2140 is the year for last satoshis.

Use passport to confirm your id. It’s the fastest way. Other ids are mostly rejected. 
With passport it’s like five minutes to confirm 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:53:18
And the initial 10k to invest in mining.

Google translate doesn't do good with turkish. 
So basically he is saying that if the crypto currency is desgined good it can be a great investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:51:44
This is the same as printing paper money.

Why the other morons dont ask him how he uses gold ? 
And the regular folk sees this and try to understand what bitcoin is. And he/she feels like a moron. But the reality is, the people on tv trying to talk about bitcoin are the morons.

Oh soory mate. Mtgox was giving out the bitcoins that are not attended by their owners to new families who can feed them love them and even maybe one day send them to the moon. 
Where have you been all these years? Didn’t you even miss them?
Now your bitcoins have a new family to make happy and proud :)
