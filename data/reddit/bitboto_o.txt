This is actually news!
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:53:20
Did you talk to their support about it yet?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:54:13
This goes for Alex Green, too. His last known location was Japan. Probably hanging out with MK.

Me gusta. It was inevitable with their international release.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:21:45
This may have valuable insight, but I just can't get past the title.
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:45:51
This is actually not news!

You have to crush the rock yourself to make the cement, otherwise it may be bugged.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:06:46
It is decided.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:27:47
Looks pretty

I was about to call this hooey and point out that other exchanges aren't the same story, but BTC China is actually showing more volume than last year, and so is Huobi and BTC-e.
To the moon!

More friction caused by fitting Bitcoin into traditional monetary systems. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:38:39
This certainly seems to be a more sensible approach to dealing with incoming regulation than other alternatives proposed here.

Funny enough, I believe he was travelling in Japan, too. He may actually BE Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:30:46
Sure, not part of the Coinbase team *wink*

That "instant max" button, such a huge improvement.

I agree with his vision that police should be trustworthy, but I'm afraid at this point it is more of a delusion than a vision. The authorities have become an industry that rakes in money at the point of a gun, and he wonders what we may have to hide.
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:38:20
What could go wrong?!
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:07:55
It is so. History is written by the victors....
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:28:42
Are you interested in non-bitcoin artifacts. Like, say, Dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-10-14 10:44:11
Although Coinbase is a great one-stop-shop, I think one thing that could improve our experience is a secure internal messaging system.
This would reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and make it easier to collect sensitive personal information when necessary.  
Any plans for something like that?
@_date: 2014-10-10 19:54:01
Paying rent. I would love a bitcoin billpay service, but I don't see how you could make it trust worthy.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:21:20
I LOLd, and was immediately sad. Bravo sir.
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:43:08
Agreed. I don't think any single analogy can sum up Bitcoin entirely. It is not like any existing structure society has today.
@_date: 2014-11-17 12:16:35
Something makes me like this company. I'm not sure what, though.

Depending on how much you are buying or selling, it may violate local laws if proper paperwork isn't handled. You should check your local applicable regulations regarding what may qualify as 'money transmission' if you are worried.
Edit: To clarify, when I say local, you should be primarily looking at state laws, but even certain counties may have guidance to follow.

If your "merchant name" in your merchant profile is set to anything, that overrides your display name. Check to see if your merchant name is your legal name. If it is, change it to something you don't mind having public. I had the same question not too long ago.

As squirmy as I'm sure this makes all of us feel, regardless of legislation blockchain payments will continue. Might as well pay to get a cheerleader on the hill.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:52:19
How can you give someone this advice based on the lack of information he provided? He doesn't even say what country he is located in.
Is there something wrong with buying on LBC? No. But is it illegal? That depends where you are, how much you are transacting, and what paperwork you plan on doing.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:39:19
What I wonder is, isn't 'locking' just another way of exchanging the bitcoin to fiat? Is there a difference in the eyes of regulators?
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:05:30
Don't you know that enjoying a company makes you a shill. This is reddit, you must be absolutely opposed to and skeptical of everything. Here's your fedora.
