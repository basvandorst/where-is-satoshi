What??? Think again...

really? From Mikes reply: "In the event that the &gt;1mb chain does eventually win, I would expect Core
to apply the patch and rejoin the consensus rather than lose all its users.
That would take XT back to being a fairly small patchset to improve the
network protocol."

Man... if only you would come out of your basement and do something productive (like him) instead of stupid comments. His dad is rich? Guess what, his dad once also was a wealthy son of a venture capitalist who helped build companys.

I think trust in companies who handle the technical layer of bitcoin is needed to reach mass adoption. You also have to trust Coinbase and even changetip. People only need to realize that they are responsible for their coins and are not supposed to store thems on 'Bitsapp' or any other 3rd party app

A mobile app where you can send bitcoin to anyone in your phone contact list, who is also using bitcoin (without explicitly adding them!). Just like with whatsapp where you could send messages to other whatsapp users without adding them

Lol upvote

Look at this. I really think anyone can contribute:

I know, volumne stats would be cool, but my goto place to find out if something is popular or not, is to look at how many people are searching for it: 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:44:10
Why isn't there something like Whatsapp for Bitcoin?
The reason for Whatsapps' success (in Europe) was, that it integrated well with your contacts.
I think a huge step towards mass adoption (a required step?) would be a smartphone wallet app that connects the generated Bitcoin address(es) with your telephone number. That way you could send someone BTC like you would send a message. My grandmother could do it!
I don't accept a "this is not safe enough" answer. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:19:51
Funny but these ads have nothing to do with the btc price . But a little snowball effect would certainly help the campaign
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:51:31
Why does everybody seem to be so very cautious about generating a paper wallet the right way. I read  but it seems almost paranoid and not very mass-adoption-likely (who installs Ubuntu from a USB?) In comparision to how most people handle their online banking credentials that process seems to be extreme
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:32:04
thank you! upvote @_date: 2014-11-24 12:07:10
(Serious) Since the process of receiving ransom money is the most dangerous part: What keeps criminals from abducting your daughter and only releasing her if you send Bitcoin to a specific address?
Or why don't they just break into houses of people with bitcoins and [ask them friendly]( to empty their cold storage?
@_date: 2014-07-21 11:38:06
How do I attach a message to a transaction? There doesn't seems to be an option with the smartphone wallets that I use (Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet)
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:08:00
Say I want to receive money from a group of people. I send them my QR Code and they send me BTC. How do I know who already payed? (without them sending me a email) With a message attached, they could write their name in it

What happens to the stream URL when you stop to stream?

Stickers! Last year i had a similar idea: [
I quit, but I still think it's great idea for a campaign... :-(
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:19:51
I think it's a great idea, worth testing. Go for it! 2$ @_date: 2014-08-11 19:00:56
I just received printed bitcoin stickers from them last week that I use for this campaign:

I'm not promising anything:

not at all!

This video will become a classic, I guarantee it. 
I am more than willing to see intelligent, reputable people find flaws in bitcoin and in the beginning it looked as if he did his homework, but unfortunatly he proceeded with bad arguments...also: please don't downvote the video
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:20:52
This was my idea for a worldwide advertising campaign bitcoin-style:

Very good conclusion. Everything else but keeping up with bandwith IS a policy change
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:50:39
unfortunately not. because of the log scale you don't really see the dent in the other versions. hover over the chart and you will see that almost all the other nodes are losing
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:54:21
Here is a chart that shows the growth:

If that is the case Segwit didn't really help alleviating network congestion?
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:08:29
Definitely Augur. I'm going to ~~gamble~~ predict the future so hard once it is out and has some volumne
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:28:52
So XT, Classic and BU were not relevant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:25:24
This article convinced me once and for all that there is NO harm in raising the blocksize
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:25:03
it looks like that is indeed a valid point when you look at the transaction volumne in $: 
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:23:29


virtually none of the remaining bitcoin core developers. There are lots of developers that are not part of core and are in favor of 2X

Really? That ist a post nowadays? Is that somehow impressive?
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:47:22
The amount of patience and levelheadedness that you have shown in the last months is truly remarkable, Erik.

Tell me one reason why Amazon or their customers would benefit from adding BTC as a payment option! 
It just doesn't make sense for anyone to accept BTC right now...sad imo

what would happen if 20 or so (otherwise competing) banks join this initiative and agree to start mining a new blockchain with each of them thowing money at mining equipment to create "network effect". Wouldn't that be a somewhat decentralized architecture with a blockchain that is immutable?
@_date: 2015-09-08 20:08:47
Can confirm, very level headed and -minor mistakes aside- good journalism. Positive tone.

I like how Google has 123.000 pages crawled from that domain:

Censored AMA answers would be hilarious... nobody who cares about Bitcoin would do an AMA in this sub I hope
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:04:23
I think this is awesome. Because it looks like it is a new (but experienced) dev team and a new client. Decentralizes the dev team!

Is it possible that parts of "unknown" belong to bigger pool operators?
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:44:04
Can someone explain the point that OP is making? Most of the coins that "popped" are way up now
