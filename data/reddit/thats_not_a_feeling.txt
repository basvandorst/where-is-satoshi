wow, talk about a strawman...
You seem to be confusing anarchism with some kind of social justice warrior cliche, do you think all anarchists have dreads and plant beets in co-ops as well?
While I am not denying that women and LGBBTQQIA(lol) face a particular set of obstacles in what we commonly call "society", but that is a very poor summary of anarchist ideals.
The most radical anarchists I know probably dress better than you, and me, in fact.
They are chameleons, they understand that the state is all-encompassing and are quite capable of blending in when the need arises.
Anarchism is the very simple, well-documented belief that people are capable of governing themselves, and do not need to be ruled over by a group of plutocrats.
This can express itself in a variety of ways. Your very lacking "summary" and the points you chose to underline ultimately say more about you than they say anything about anarchism.
They also underline that you have not understood what that word actually means, despite your "time spent with fringe politcal groups over the years"
For one thing, I would go so far as to say that any group which defines themselves as "political" is already outing themselves to be a bunch of cunts.
there is no denying that there are a variety of left-leaning groups busy bickering with each other about patriarchy, words we are and arent allowed to use, and why we are not allowed to do anything more radical than a candlelight vigil.
These fuckwits are doing little to actually free humanity from the yoke of the state, in fact I would go so far as to say that many of the SWJ movements are in fact controlled opposition, or they were well-intentioned originally and now have been co-opted.
Ultimately, a lot of so-called anarchists are statists attempting to negate their cognitive dissonance with minutia.
So long story short, NO, fucking Hippies and pseudo-feminists on tumblr are NOT an accurate representation of anarchism.

this is true as well, but its preeety fuckin easy to tumble coin, and I really doubt there would be anyway to enforce "black" and "white" bitcoins, which has been debated by various statists ad naseum.
I think the benefits of going along with these cunts for now outweighs the negative effects (which we will hopefully be able to mitigate with more and more ease as time progresses)

Ive spent a bunch of coins already, although most of them were on the road....
really stupid looking back, I could have gotten cocaine and high-grade pretty much anywhere, but there was just something magical about sending bits to some random criminal, and getting a letter from the Hilton the next day with a banging gram of coke.
This was when coin was at about 5 dolla, so yeah you can imagine how much I technically spent on said...
It truly felt revolutionary at the time.
Oh yeah I also play poker for coin exclusively, gambling in and of itself is basically a guarantee that BTC will become semi-mainstream eventually.
ohh and I really want to get some of those alpaca socks, they look hella comfy.
ah fuck i need to fire something at Seansoutpost as well.
GIVE SEAN SOME COIN, PEOPLE. HE MAKES GOOD SAMMICHES AND YOU NEED THE KARMA, REAL KARMA

@_date: 2014-04-11 04:50:25
You mean DARPA web?
what we really need is a global meshnet, the future of the internet looks a lot darker than the future of bitcoin imo, which is obviously a problem for bitcoin.

I think all we need to do is wait for some creepy/bad news like cyprus a yearish ago.
chill out people, we are getting a second chance here, its what ive been waiting for honestly..
heres hoping we go below 200!

I too have found that even "rational" potheads i.e. people that arent 16 and define themselves through their drug consumption *still* have a tendencyto gravitate to this number...
I wouldnt be suprised is what im saying.

Molyneux is a bit of a twat, honestly.
His video on Gun control statistics is excellent, and im sure there are others that are good, but ultimateley I think hes a douchebag and has ulterior motives.
If you want to hear something creepy from this guy, hes got a video on how he describes his utopian society, and how we would deal with criminals(shudder)
His video on Zimmerman was also full of misinfo, ryan dawson called him out on that bullshit: 
all in all I would say dont trust this guy, as much as he styles himself as some kind of socrates

this all reeks of smart grid honestly...
I dont fucking want all my devices to be connected, I want to have a very clear overview of what can connect to what and when.
All this does is open up all kinds of doors for vulnerabilities.
You havent really made a case against QR, other than "hurr durr some people are too stupid to use it"
thats a copout if ive ever seen one, and combined with your clickbait title I question everything about this angle..
Qr works fine. I know a chick that doesnt know shit about tech, shes scanned way more QRs with her (sp)Iphone than I ever have...
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:01:47
great, thank you.
I will be firing some coin at these tech-priests, god knows they deserve it.
We need meshnets, badly. The internet as we know it is going down and no amount of begging at the feet of our masters will change that.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:30:07
hes right.
It would be really fucking easy to mess with someones timeline, reminds me of the historical revisionism the protagonist in 1984 is busy perpetrating..
lets say you piss off the state in some dystopian near-future, woop de do all of a sudden youve been friends with a goddamn thought terrorist for 2 years, look theres a photo of you and him, heres some cell phone data linking you two...
looks like the best plan of action in the name of zhe homeland is rendition to gitmo nation east, shitizen!
Obviously this is an exaggeration but lets face it, facebook is creepy as fuck and the feds basically have an office at their HQ
facebook is the kind of tool the stasi would have creamed their pants over, the last thing I want is them "representing" my identity, thats about as far from trust as you can get with me.
There have already been claims of facebook manipulating peoples pages, in real time.
If I want proof of someones identity I go and meet them face to face.
I dont need proof of anyones identity to do business in BTC, thats the beauty of it. Coin talks
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:38:32
hello fellow seal!
read all this shit, sucks mane im sorry you lost your coins.
I was actually running Multibit way back when coin was 5-10 dolla, never had any problems.
Ill definitely tell people to watch out for this, sounds like a real clusterfuck, and no help from multibit peeps. Hope you get your coin back:-(
(p.s I thought you were Lew_bama, he got a job at starbucks recently lol) rather not say who I am since im here on a throwaway for various reasons, but ill say hi if I see you in the lobby;-)

I know nothing of this case but THIS:
"The police have been making a concerted effort to locate my assets in Cyprus, which doesn't seem the most logical way of handling such a case, surely they should be trying to contact me to get the full picture and not issuing warrants based on hearsay."
is hilarious, thats EXACTLY how the cops do business everywhere and it is in fact very logical.
Assets first, nigga.
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:29:47
It nice when you got in at 5 dolla hahaha pretty hard for shit to go wrong..
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:43:26
listening to the recent podcast aboout sidechains made me fell *really* stupid, what exactly is the main reason why this would be useful?
not clogging up the blockchain? or is it more of a blockchain experimental build, so things can be tested before they are fully incorporated?
I am not a smart man...
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:13:47
heh i wonder how many people are thinking about any local yard sales as they read this...

If I wasnt poor as fuck myself, I would make sure that these kinds of crews stay fed and happy.
That would probably be a solid investment in our future, at a very low cost.
Shit is cheap in Spain, you could give them ample protein and as much pueblo tobacco as they want for a few hundred euros a month, no strings attached.
Would be worth more than millions invested in some start up in my honest opinion.
Does anyone here know anythihng about Gui-fi? Is it like CJDNS?
I cant even find a donation link or a wallet of Amir Taaki

I would love to think that the call for regulation is actually a trojan horse, but im not so sure honestly...
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:12:36
I havent finished this whole thing but the biggest logical flaw I can see so far is that this guy is assuming *nobody is going to fuck with BTC*, as in a government, or some kind of fuckin International Bankster task force.
I think this is entirely possible in the near future, so my main interest in stuff like LTC is as a hedge, a hedge in case the Powers that be try to take this whole fucking thing down.
This guy is implying that BTC will *always* have the biggest market cap of the cryptos, and although that seems highly likely its is most certainly not a given
@_date: 2014-04-15 12:03:20
yeah, people that like to whip out labels are usually full of shit, and the passive-aggressive SJWs out there are probably doing more damage than good.
I can say little about unSystem atm, although I hopefully will know more soon.
In my limited experience, real anarchists dont go waving their black flag around for all to see. They will give you their political leanings if you press them for it, but foremost they are involved in projects that do not automatically fall under the auspice of "anarchism"
To be perfectly frank, people that aggressively label themselves are not only hypocrites, they can be downright fucking dangerous.
These are the types that would happily line their ideological opponents against the wall if their theroetical "revolution" ever happened. Authoritarians, essentially.
I tend to lend "hacktivism" more credence than your usual run of the mill social activism, these people are at the very least approaching the problem with a unique set of skills as opposed to simply elevating themselves to some kind of martyr status. Even if you are doing important work for humanity, entitlement leads to supremacism, which makes you no different from the powers that be, ultimately.
The best example imo is the anti-fa movement, which can get downright facistic in some parts of europe.
Its a tricky fucking landscape, no doubt. We should be looking for ways in which we are all similar and finding common enemies, not interfighting.
Call me a paranoid schiz, but I am quite certain there are forces at work that are actively undermining any kind of cohesion, "divide and conquer" so to speak. I think this is very important in order to uphold the present power structure.

oh no, I meant is right.

Its an interesting thought experiment I guess, im sure there are people that actually use their timeline for something but to claim it is an accurate record of anything when Fakebook can change it anytime they want, well thats bullshit to say it in simple terms
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:53:52
yes, definitely, he floods it with excess info that is irrelevant, almost as if to mask the event in minutia.
the zimzam vid in particular demonsrates how he uses "facts" to come to a predetermined conclusion, not exactly a "truth seeker and philosopher" if you ask me
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:18:00
I would say that a semi-intelligent anarchist quickly dismisses the idea of being some kind of martyr in the favor of being effective.
Nothing is gained from denying reality and making things hard on yourself.
Dumpster diving can still be viable, but the "property is theft" shtick is usually only blown out of proportion by people that are attempting to create some kind of strawman against anarchism in general.
Ultimately I would say the reason that "anarchists" choose to live on societies peiphery is because most are in some form or another aware that "you do not change the system from within, the system changes you"
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:48:50
the other guy that answered me gave a good retort, I would suggest you look at that
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:44:03
so....I should buy doge?
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:36:03
Excellent points.
In fact the only problem a pleb like me can find in your logic would be if the..."powers that be" actually designed BTC from the get-go to slowly phase out national fiat currencies and get us all on the one world government track...
As far as I can tell thats pretty far out there, so all in all im with you.
Fuck it. Let the regulators try and regulate. They cant stop this
