they dont. stop shilling this exchange and spreading misinformation

if this story is true, i feel bad for the sudden influx of americans who are signing up... and will find out afterwards that there is no way to deposit ach usd online like coinbase. they will need to go to their bank and pay to send a wire.

this is a good idea. i was wondering what exchanges have usdc pairs
@_date: 2019-10-05 04:28:11
wrong, because coinbase covers ACH transfer in US and kraken does not.  dyor, but you are correct that with Kraken, your bank will charge not kraken, which is why i wrote "wire charge", not "wire fee".

since they dont disclose their exchange rate or btc withdrawal fees i am not going to do all their kyc to find out.

and at the same time never investing more than you are willing to lose. and being ok with the value going to zero. you are going to need two different brains to make ops mindset work

maybe downvoters have account with kraken and know first hand this page on their site is bs. there is no way to do ach. support tells customer to go to bank and request to initiante ach. which they dont do as banks dont do free services to be kind

no mention of how much they charge to withdrawal btc. also how they calculate their exchange rate.  these costs are what makes coinbase still the cheapest exchange, unfortunately. i follow my dollar, so does most everyone, that is why everyone is on coinbase, and still will be

lol. WRONG. not according to their customer support. if you are in USA you have to go to your bank in person and request a ach tranfer. there is also no way to do it on their website, you would know that if you had an account. but fun to tell people they are wrong on the internet isnt it

everyone arguing about what actual fees are and no info on their website. 
i posted a kraken comparison (below) can anyone give similar (verifiable) info on voyager

\-Wire charge $20 (no ACH in USA)
\-wire deposit fee $5
\-exchange fee $16 (%0.16)
\-withdrawal fee $4 (0.0005BTC)
Total: $45
$10,000 purchase of BTC via Coinbase
\-ACH deposit charge $0
\-ACH deposit fee $0
\-exchange fee $50 (%0.5)
\-withdrawal fee $0 (0BTC)
Total: $50
@_date: 2019-10-05 04:30:11
right, i forgot you can actually do that instead of free ach tranfer

sepa = single euro payments area. not everyone lives in EU.  USA cheapest option is the one i outlined above
@_date: 2019-10-05 04:28:35
