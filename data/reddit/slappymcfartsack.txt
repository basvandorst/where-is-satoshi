Horse and buggy owners might have been unfriendly towards automobiles in the same sort of way

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:13:42
You would need at least the initial one transaction to show.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:15:49
I bought in the day before 10k was hit, so then my value went down, so I bought $100 (cdn) more, so I'm happy with my 0.0145 btc empire!
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:13:08

Just because Gates figured how to make Windows work, doesn't mean he can fly a jet, bake a cake, or predict Bitcoin prices, amongst other shortcomings.  :)
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:48:21
-Or not.
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:34:25
Is this the 74th person this week to predict huge Bitcoin numbers, or the 75th?  I forget.
They don't know any better than any of you know.
Take their advice with a grain of salt.
