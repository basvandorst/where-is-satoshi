Why does it matter that you’re new to the subreddit? You don’t need to know anything about bitcoin to know that someone isn’t going to give 3.5 billion dollars away via a random email

You can only tell misinformation from information if you “waste” time analysing it. If you don’t tolerate the authors comments then isn’t calling it out for what it is the best mode of action

I made a post which asked some questions about an article on the lightning network. It didn't show up in 'new', I can see the post but if I log out it says it has been removed - but doesn't say why and I didn't get any automod messages or anything, anyone know what the go is

Asking for good bitcoin exchanges on the bitcoin subreddit, how dare they.

A bitcoin subreddit isn’t the place to discuss articles about bitcoin?

Who’s website is that? The ticker for the coin being sold on there is BTCC, so it’s not the same “Bitcoin core” being sold on ver’s website which is BTC (real bitcoin).

Bitcoin core = Bitcoin = BTC. It’s not an altcoin,

BCH supporters won’t call it Bitcoin because they believe their version is the ‘real bitcoin’ hence they call BTC Bitcoin core. It’s deceiving, but also is completely unrelated to bitcoincore.com, which sells a completely different coin to those sold in bitcoin.com.

Those numbers don’t look right... what do you use for Q? If M is 15 million and V is 4, Q would have to be 1.2e9 to give P = 0.05
Besides, that formula may have worked in 1911, but there are other aspects of cryptocurrencies which separate them from normal money which give them value, that this formula doesn’t account  for.

He’s saying it’s value has fallen like 90% before and still recovered, so recovering from a 50% fall is possible if not likely
