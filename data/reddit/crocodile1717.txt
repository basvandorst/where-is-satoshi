Ok will do! Thank you!!

Thanks - just took a look at that website, but it seems like they get your keys if you have forgotten/lost them, so not that applicable as I know where both keys are - they're on the hard drive, problem is that the hard drive doesn't work anymore, so can't get them.

Unfortunately the hard drive is completely broken (doesn't spin), and I'm not experienced enough to fix it, so it's either no bitcoin ever or attempt to get them back and maybe get them stolen. Bit of a difficult situation...
Sorry I don't think I quite understand, the file is just a txt file on my desktop - how would this have been compromised? I've never sent it to anyone and to the best of my knowledge my laptop was never hacked/had a virus.

That's my plan currently, but finding said reputable service that does home visits is proving quite difficult unfortunately.
Question - in your opinion, reckon i should tell the specialist about the bitcoin so they know what they're looking for which might help them or just keep quiet?

Ok i think I understand.. but how will I send the coins to a new wallet if multibit doesn't exist anymore?

Yeah makes sense, thanks! I will be writing it down on paper the moment I get it back.
Any recommendations for a secure wallet? And I don't think I've ever switched wallet before, is it as simple as putting your keys into the new software? Or do I need something more from the old multibit software to transfer?

Problem is, even if I was to watch someone repair my harddrive right in front of me, I don't know what I'm looking for. I think I just need the wallet.dat file (and the key txt file) but I don't know what format this will be in, or where it's usually saved etc. And even if I found this file, I don't know if that's all I need to access my btc or if I need other files/software etc. I bought these btc a long time ago, and my memory is very hazy....
Was thinking of asking for a house call but wouldn't that then be an immediate flag to the repair person that there's something valuable on there?
