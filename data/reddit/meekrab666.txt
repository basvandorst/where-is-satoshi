good to know!  also back then, circle did a college program where you did certain things with btc like buy things with btc from 2 brick &amp; mortars stores, 2 online stores, and giving btc to someone.  you would post these on social media and whoever got the most likes would win more btc.  not sure if they do that anymore either, but you can look online to see if certain exchanges support college students

I was just in ARG a few weeks ago and was there for two weeks.  When i first got there, it was 28 ARS for $1.  the last few days i was there, it went to 31 ARS for a $1. 
The fucked part is, a lot of businesses in argentina dont accept debit or credit card, so tourists have to withdraw cash.  the ATMs limit cash withdrawals at 2000 ARS, maybe 3k at some.  on top of that, they charge you around 200 ARS to withdraw.  
i really liked argentina but the whole currency there is so fucked.

i was talking to my buddy about this a few days ago.  but the BCH thing taught me about how wallets work.  I didnt really understand the whole concept of private/public key, and how sweeping accounts worked.  the BCH fork taught me the tech behind wallets.  I probably wouldve never learned if it wasnt for Roger and Jihan

do it!  also make sure you buy it from the the official ledger page.  im sure youve read threads where people buy ledgers from a 3rd party and the device was compromised.

i have the ledger and i like it.  its simple.  they are about to release the desktop app soon.  currently its a chrome app.  i havent used anything else.  you should invest, its give me a peace of mind.  i dont have to always be paranoid anymore

i use to work at the bank, and saw the flaws of the entire banking system.  then i found out about bitcoin and it solved a lot of the flaws of bank esp when it came to remittance and transfers.  i quit the bank soon after.

i went to CES 2015 when they first had world of bitcoin area.  Circle and maybe it was blockchain.info was giving out $5 worth of BTC (around 0.02 at the time).  I saved them and cashed them out awhile ago to pay for some small bills and treat myself.
