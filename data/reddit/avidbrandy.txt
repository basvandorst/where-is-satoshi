I didn't realize they raised fees when it happens. That's really cool of them.

Multibit will show a transaction as unconfirmed in your wallet as soon as the blockchain sees the transaction. Perhaps I didn't 'get' them, but was at least able to see that there was a transaction made to my wallet almost immediately.
@_date: 2014-02-02 11:06:24
When I heard about these issues I immediately went and withdrew the 2BTC I had at MtGox. I received it within literally seconds. Seconds. Like 4 fucking seconds before Multibit showed it in my wallet. And another few seconds for first confirmation. 
I am a fake account that has existed for the last 3 years solely to tell you that This transaction worked. Though this may upset my wife, my existence is now fulfilled. I may die in piece. 
Edit: here's the transaction: 
It looks like mtGox used a .001 transaction fee which would explain why I got it so fast. BUT FUCK ME I'M NOT REAL.
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:07:56
This is a very silly question.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:14:21
No I can confirm what he said. I withdrew several BTC about 12 hours ago from MtGox, and within seconds it showed in my transactions on Multibit. the fee you pay is .001, not .0001, so it's extremely fast. I had no issues withdrawing BTC from MtGox. Nor did I the last time someone said BTC withdrawels had been halted.

I used to on  in very small amounts, but enforcing loans is still usually more trouble than it's worth at the moment. Though I made a small amount on it, I started sitting out when BTC got over $100 each. Too risky right now.

I did a similar thing a few years ago. Needless to say it was with an amount of bitcoins that I now regret.
@_date: 2014-01-18 13:07:38
That's what I do. I have a computer that hasn't been connected to the internet for years, that I took a flash drive and put all my bitcoin software on. Then I use the flash drive as a backup now and never connect it to any other computer. I generate all my wallets on there.
@_date: 2014-01-01 10:29:56
That's because Bitcoin is still in it's early stages trying to find what it's actual value is. I saw a soap site the other day where soap cost .01BTC each. It didn't fluctuate. That kind of pricing will be more common as time goes on, and we stop using the dollar for reference.
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:53:40

I love bitcoin and am heavily invested, but stuff like this always makes me chuckle.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:27:31
Yea I really like the idea. I keep my bitcoins in about 3 dozen wallets, and it would very handy not to input the pub keys 1 by 1 into blockchain whenever I feel paranoid.
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:21:22
Yea exactly. I remember for a while on the way up just constantly monitoring the CNY price because it was indicative of where the USD price would be later. I think they peaked a little higher too.

I'm curious, does anyone know what Stewart's personal opinion is on bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:02:22
I feel you. I sold hundreds between $3 and $20. Then I sold a large amount at $77 thinking we must be nearing the peak of the $255 bubble. After that one I finished I figured out the error of my ways and put it all back at $100-$110. 
Some very costly mistakes, but no point regretting it at this point. All gonna work out still.

Not trying to be a sarcastic prick. Logically you hold if it's going up. But if given the choice, I would rather keep my spending money in BTC as well on the off-chance I don't spend it.
