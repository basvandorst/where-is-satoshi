Canadian here.  
1) We have to buy $500 worth of currency for our limit timer to start.  
It should take 1 week to get to $500 purchased (if you buy $250 on the day you open your account and then $250 once you can again) because of the $250 a week limit.  
2) After you have purchased $500 worth the limit timer will start to count down (30 days).  
So to get your limit up to $1000 it takes approx 1 and a half months.

Something along the lines of that.. I just thought it was funny people are trying to capitalize off bitcoin using these methods. Next well see a binary trader bitcoin popup.

What makes this any different than seals with clubs? Or any other Bitcoin poker website, what problems are you solving..?

They have been around for awhile and used to list an ALT I was buying. Deposited BTC Purchased the ALT from them once with no problems but this was last year and it's no longer listed. I'd imagine the errors are because their first language is not English.

No and I also turned off UBlock, my guess is due to localization.

Canadian, doesn't apply here. We can't use Gdax.

Localbitcoins or Kraken. I know some people who have used quadrigacx but haven't tried them myself.

I have this turned on for Chrome:  
Keep local data only until you quit your browser  
So no caching issue, I see bitcoin.org first still and wiki second.

Bitcoin:  
Quick:   
Full Node:   
Never use an exchange as a "wallet"  
Other types of coins will need coin specific wallets there are services like  but they don't support every single coin.

The only problem you'll have is if you place ads on the site for revenue, you'll have to get a guardian to help you on that side of things.

IMO it is in your best interest to place unobtrusive ads for extra revenue it will help pay your hosting and domain costs at the very least..
