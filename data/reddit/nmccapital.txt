Agreed. If they were going to be actual market participants it be a much different story. But thats not going to be the case.

Why don’t we all donate 1% of our BTC Hodlings? We’d be there in no time.

Sorry No link, but apparently Bloomberg is running a six part series on cryptocurrencies. This should be some dog and pony show.

Even if it goes to 100k a btc doesn’t matter in your case. You practiced discipline and stuck to your convictions kudos to you for that.  Great story. 
Be sure to give that family member a few shekels for storing that user seed on the photo for you.

Is it just me or does anyone else not want big financial institutions and IB’s getting involved in BTC? I originally like many others thought that instruments like BTC derivatives, puts, calls, futures etc etc would be key for broader adoption and acceptance but Im rethinking this. At current our price do swing wildly but thats because its a truly unregulated free market. Im beginning to fear that the banks will to an extent manipulate and mutate financial instruments linked to BTC much the same as they did with mortgages CMBS, CDS’ , CDO’s the list goes on(Note Im not comparing crypto currencies to the housing bubble I’m referring to banks consistently creating profitable instruments that have calamitous effects). In the end they may end up causing systemic risk once again and the public wont be able to tell the difference between who’s to blame in the case of a correction. Derivatives and what not only create price stability in the near term at the expense of future buyers in all reality. I really hope the BTC price remains independent of all the incoming financial instruments and institutional money. I thought we wanted to get away from the Banks??

Thats the point I have a bit of insight and Ive spoken to bankers, brokers, the likes and they’re not necessarily interested in scaling props or broader adoption or use cases. Thats why I don’t think its gonna the good news people often think it is. My point they don’t have the protocols best interest in mind but we all know that right? Btw wouldn’t be in finance had it not been for BTC so my loyalty lies here. I Learned to code before I learned to trade.

Correct but in regards to the uneducated public. Thats  my fault for clarifying. Im speaking in regards to price perception and broader awareness. Bloomberg and the likes consistently misrepresent and misinterpret BTC already cant imagine what the headlines will be after the rollout. Its not as if they control 51% of the network but if the institutional money floods it could get dicey. Fin institutions especially exchanges simply transfer risk they don’t create any value. Appreciate the forwardness however.

I fully agree. Certain times I cant even blame them for making misinterpretations or bad comparisons. Theyre given notes for a segment to report on and they’re not informed enough to meaningfully speak on the topic.
They try their best to analyze crypto and  BTC by relating it to traditional financial markets and assets which shouldn’t be done for the sake of the public.
