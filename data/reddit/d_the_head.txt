i've done the same over the last two months when i first got in. started at 750 and now have average at 583 for 4 coins. purchases are usually .10-.25 at a time, but i made the mistake of making the larger purchases (.4 and .6) right at the beginning without thinking about the volatility and spreading out purchases. i'd still buy at 750 if that's where the market is since i believe in the long-term usefulness and limited supply economics in our favor.

if you're a more careful reader, you'll see the original post said "easy money policy". that's monetary policy, not wall street acting like deregulated fucktards. i'd recommend to you, some fucking glasses.

I think you nailed it. So basically all I did was transfer coins from a hot wallet on Coinbase to a hot wallet on Blockchain.info.
I'm not looking to spend btc at all. It's just a wallet that will receive deposits. 
So what I need to do for the security I'm looking for is to generate a private key offline for a new address and then transfer the coins from my current blockchain wallet?

how have you been purchasing bitcoins? with some form of currency backed by a government? indeed. 


but you're taxed on transactions


what do you call december?

Agreed. Ayn Rand and Ayn Rand Lovers are the worst kind of dreamers. It's one thing to be hopeful and have public discourse on improving the state of "being" and society. It's an entirely different discussion to believe that government is the root of all evil and that individualism and oneness is the highest form of existence.

it's a currency and an asset. anything generally accepted for exchange is considered a currency. brush up on your macro econ. pegging currencies is a horrible economic policy unless very, very specific qualifications are met that rarely occur IRL. and the status of pegged or not-pegged does not a currency make. i can use my feces as currency if it were generally accepted.

it's going to be much easier for general acceptance when there's a solid and easy reference point for information. 
much better than: go here for this, go there for that, in my opinion this is best for those ect..

no need to be so smug. please explain how mtgox going bankrupt leads to a pullout of cryptsy? the big news of losses with mtgox occurred well over a week ago. bankruptcy doesn't change anything. the coins were already gone and traders already knew that.

i've waited since last tuesday to ask this moronic question:
i transferred btc from my coinbase account to a blockchain wallet. i printed the wallet and the pass phrase for storage without ever downloading anything (two copies of each in separate locked places in case shit happens). i've also enabled 2FA for logging into blockchain.info. is there anything else i should be doing to secure my wallet short of doing what some users suggest by getting a laptop not connected to the internet yadda yadda?
thanks in advance for the help!

how do people not realize they haven't lost anything if they haven't sold? if you're worried about being 50% down, then stop looking at the number. if you couldn't afford to be 50% down then you shouldn't have bought into the world's least understood currency. 
also, we all have individual risk profiles. to say that i'm dumb for putting 75% of my investment dollars in bitcoin doesn't look at the whole picture. i'm 29 and make a good bit of money, i can afford to fall on my face for investments and still have a nice paycheck next week. think about how many other individual stories there are. stop prescribing percentages to people like it's some goddamn "how to manage a portfolio in 10 easy steps" book.

exactly this. it's the same as if someone sold stocks and used the money to buy a car. you'd owe taxes on the profits from the stock you sold, but that is unrelated to what you did with the money afterwards.

nice. i stand corrected on the logistic trend. never used R. i use SAS for work. i downloaded the input dataset. would you mind linking to the forecast output? i'm curious to see how this plays out.

I can't believe you have an economics degree. How the fuck would you get a group of people to vote on monetary policy? The sole fucking reason the Central Bank is SEPARATE from government is because PEOPLE IN POWER DOMINATE THE MEDIA AND MESSAGING IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, i.e. our current fucking political process. Why would you give them something as important as the most important currency in the world to fuck up as well? They already have enough media slant to convince idiots what to think. Do you really believe we should decentralize the bank and allow those guys to make the choices? Do you think the people with all the fucking money would all of a sudden work towards a goal that benefits "the people"? Do you think the people that don't vote right now and don't give a shit about politics would now have some reason to vote about which way they would like interest rates to go? It's a pipe dream. For all the flack about what's wrong with our current monetary system, it works pretty fucking well. We have the world's reserve currency. Protect it like it's your butthole (unless you like that and i have no backup analogy) and we'll keep on keeping on.

where are the data smoothing (alpha) and trend smoothing (beta) factors being set? i'm assuming the trend smoothing factor shouldn't have to be so high as there isn't much of a trend. i'm curious of the output at somewhat higher levels of alpha (.7-.8) as the volatility is pretty high with some self-reinforcing patterns.
is this R?
