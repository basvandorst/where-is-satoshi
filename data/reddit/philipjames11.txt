I appreciate your response, as it makes a lot of sense. But if btc will remain volatile by tens of thousands of dollars every few years, then it will be impossible to be used as a transaction medium.

It's not fud its critical thinking. I'm not sure why you're so defensive of something you cant back up with facts. Sure you can get an account and trade. You can also decrease the salinity of the ocean by pouring freshwater into it. You implied inflation could happen at the drop of a hat, and perhaps I misconstrued that as random, but i dont really see a different way of interpreting it

Utilities, sure perhaps there may be a tiny bit of room if you consider commodities in that space, but I wouldn't. Strictly gas, electric, etc are generally safe bets, and you can play in that market with relative safety. So sure you can have utilities. But currency? No way man. Look at currency exchange rate scams. Through the roof. Theres plenty of articles as to why you cant trade gov currency's for a living.

Good point about Google. So you know forex is basically huge banks trying to control currency prices by making deals with other banks in the range of a few billion dollars. And the DXY hasn't varied more than 10 points in the last 3 years, and no more than around 35 points for all time. It definitely helps my point, but I'm not sure of the one you were trying to make?

Very interesting. Looking into right now. Seems as though most of that is big banks however with slim margins and international deals for buying vs selling to control prices a bit. Idk still looking at it. My mind was more along the lines of people transferring money to a diff currency, waiting for a while, and transferring back to their home currency. That kind of stuff is not sustainable for an individual. Forex is mostly for large banks. I can see how they'd make a profit, but I dont see any chance for an individual

Forex is not people. Its huge banks controlling prices for calculated gain. And inflation isnt random theres causes. A quick Google search could tell you that much.

Happy cake day. I dont think that last part makes sense. It can go up or down thousands of dollars. It could disappear if the gov invents it's own crypto. It can disappear in lieu of a different currency. It can disappear if theres a tech oversight. Hell if the market just decides it doesnt want it then it's gone. I agree saving bitcoin is using bitcoin though. It's new, and it needs people who believe in it to make POCs using their own stores and wallets. However people 'hodl'ing increases prices and when they sell it decreases. Anyone who thinks about  hodl is part of what is going to kill bitcoin. Now if you want to hodl to keep prices high, and not cash out when you see profits, or when you see losses, then you're what might help save bitcoin. But my main point is that speculation for profit is the issue. Buying to use and support it via making transactions with merchants that accept it is the ideal, 'correct' scenario

Theres literally a saying that goes once your taxi driver tells you to buy a stock you should sell immediately.

At that point you've already lost money and shouldve sold long ago.
