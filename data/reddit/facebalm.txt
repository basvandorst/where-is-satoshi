What an ignorant and hypocritic comment. You call the people that were essential to Bitcoin's beginnings, the only ones that believed in it and had the foresight to realize how impactful and valuable it will be, a cancer to bitcoin. 


You are talking to millionaires by the way.


Hypocrisy and you don't even realize it. All you want is to make a quick buck or two, or even out your losses by artificially inflating the price - again. Another huge crash would be terrible for BItcoins public image. With every crash, the public are taking it less seriously.

...Think what?

Because it's been said a billion times in every thread in this subreddit and every forum post and blog comment about bitcoin. It's actually reason # &lt;10 why bitcoin "will do well".

I think people seriously underestimate how big SR was and how much it meant for the Bitcoin economy.
9.000.000 Bitcoins have gone through SR, there are 12.000.000 Bitcoins in total. So I'd say SR is at this point synonymous to BTC. Remember a few years ago that btc was worth less than 5 dollars, suddenly SR became known internet-wide and bitcoin value rose to 35 BTC. And that's even before SR even had a forum, or 100k users.
The Silk Road is reported to have had just short of a million registered accounts.

Your argument makes no sense. What if you withdrew from another exchange that took 1 day. If it rose 30% in 8 weeks, it would affect you the exact same way.
The point is that you get the money you sold your Bitcoins for in both cases.

I'm just answering the question.

Sorry, only threads on the frontpage are about SR getting seized. I thought it would be worth it to warn people. Oh well.

I'm not saying BTC is not a viable currency, at no point in my post did I even insinuate that. I'm just saying it's crashing hard because of this.

3/4 Bitcoins have gone through SR. So I'd say SR is at this point *synonymous* to BTC. Remember a few years ago that btc was worth less than 5 dollars, suddenly SR became known internet-wide and bitcoin value rose to 35 BTC. And that's even before SR even had a forum, or 100k users.

Haha bull trap for sure.

Talking about technical indicators as if they, alone, can make you a profitable trader. This is bullshit, no serious (profitable) trader relies on RSI or MACD or any other indicators. People upvoted that idiot because they've never heard of indicators and have never traded in the past, so his reasoning sounds very scientific to them.
I suggest to people that want to learn more about trading to head over to Never listen to "experts", *you* are responsible for *your own* money, not strangers, so educate yourself. It isn't easy, that's the only sure thing.
