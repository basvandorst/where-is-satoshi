Just HOLD. Thank me later.

Appreciate :)

Thanks for your comments! Unfortunately you can't, although this might be possible in the future. More on that:

You should give Coinomi Universal HD Wallet a go:  which does exactly what you're asking for.

Hi storyplus, thanks for your comments. 
If you are so concerned about wallets you should check out the 2-of-3 multisig transactions, in this way the responsibility for your coins stays in the blockchain and all you need is 2 out of total 3 keys to use them, if a hacker gains access to your device and you keep only one key there they won't be able to steal your coins and on top of that 2-of-3 multisigs facilitate transactions in a totally trustless environment as you don't have to share your private keys with any 3rd party (such as an e-wallet provider) if you choose to go this way. 
There are many ways to monitor an address, the easiest is to call listreceivedbyaddress or listunspent, they both perform pretty well and yes, the most effective way to know you received funds is to run a loop in perpetuity for the addresses or the accounts you wish to monitor. For most specific questions you can also use BitcoinLib's Issues facility on GitHub.

Good to see more C# contributions.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:17:31
Sure. Konstantin Ineshin, Bitnet's author was a pioneer and most of the wrappers that were released after bitnet, including bitlib, bootstrapped from it.
That being said, one major difference is that Bitnet was last updated on 2011 and its signatures are now broken, whereas Bitlib is fully up-to-date (2014). 
Furthermore, Bitlib follows a design-by-contract service-oriented architecture, uses strongly-typed structures for complex RPC daeamon's requests and responses, performs all the JSON casting behind the scenes so you don't have to do it manually in every single RPC call, encapsulates all Qt API's logic into a single interface, it comes along with some extended methods for every-day scenarios where the default methods fall short, it is Testnet-ready, fully configurable, and on top of that you get two test clients (console + web) out of the box with some nice demo methods implemented in them. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:07:59
There's already a great C# library doing that: 
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:23:57
Although Bitlib is hashing-agnostic, it hasn't been tested yet against alternative coins except for Litecoin which is scrypt based just like Dogecoin and works fine except for minor parts where implementation is just different but those can be patched pretty easily. As a quick test, you can run the console-based test client included in the project which comes with a variety of demo methods and see if everything runs smoothly.

Just a heads up, BitcoinLib is now fully up-to-date with bitcoin-cli 0.9.0.
@_date: 2014-04-20 00:38:54
This one is actually pretty cool: 
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:09:38
[BitcoinLib]( is a battle-tested  Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Bitcoin-Clones Library &amp; RPC Wrapper written in C Just give it a go, it's pretty straightforward.

Fantastic job, well done! How would you like to be mentioned in the "About &gt; Translators" sections of the app?
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:48:21
Good job! Some corrections:
* While Coinomi has 284 reviews it's displayed below Airbitz that has 256
* Coinomi is multilingual (languages currently available: English, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and Russian), it is translated and reviewed by native speakers with excellent technical background on oneskyapp.

Thank you, I'm sure our French speaking users will love it.

Thanks for your feedback, btceacc. Please bear in mind that Coinomi is not a one-man show; we are a team of twenty and counting. Customer Reps are available on a 24/7 basis and they handle most of the interaction with our user base. I still didn't quite get how all this relates to me personally, but I guess I can live with that. I can agree with you in most points and although I'm tempted to argue others my time is very limited, so I'll kindly pass. For what it's worth, our objection to the recent proceedings wasn't to the findings per se, but to the way they were (not) communicated to us properly and in time so that all this unnecessary noise could have been prevented in the first place. We also failed to communicate this properly to our users and so we soon found ourselves asphyxiating amid the s* storm. But it's OK. S* happens, life goes on. Always look for the silver lining, they say. Thank you for your comments and for standing up for Coinomi, btceacc. We owe you one.

Great comment.

Thanks for your feedback and for standing up for Coinomi. Having said that, I didn't quite get how my "communication problems" are related to this issue. As a CEO I'm definitely responsible for the way our company operates and handles such issues, but since I don't run our media I don't see how that comment is relevant. Once more, thank you for supporting Coinomi. ps: I'm George.

Yeah let's bankrupt these scumbags that have been helping cryptos evolve since day one and provide for free a super-safe wallet that took hundreds of thousands of dollars and many years of hard work to build. It's only fair after all, no?
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:22:39
The Glidera integration will be included in Coinomi's next update, along with a similar service for Europe.
