Wow, that's pretty amazing stuff. Thanks.

Can anyone ELI5 what multi-signature means to someone who's been away from bitcoin for a while?

I just bought one a couple days ago, can't wait to actually see it in person.

PM your email, my girlfriend really likes sketchy art and I think she'd really like your stuff. Thanks!

Not sure if...

Has anyone in here purchased a coin? If so, do you have any images you can share?

You can always buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. There's no need to buy a whole Bitcoin. Think of it this way, if you don't buy .06BTC today (~$25USD), this time next year you may be kicking yourself for not being able to afford that same .06BTC then. If you lose that $20, no big deal right? You can obviously adjust the money to what you feel comfortable losing.
That's what I did when it was at $40, then again at $150 and now again at $250. I've only put in what I'm comfortable losing, but so far it's made me a lot of money.

Does the inside piece pop out when you pull out the sticker? Or is the key hidden under it? I really want one but it's hard to justify it when I can just use that money to buy an actual bitcoin. They just look so cool!

It's dropping pretty quick right now, think of it as a savings for when it finally balances out and you're able to purchase them at a lower price.

I don't think it's stopping anyone but once you transfer BTC to Bitstamp you're selling at whatever prices they have there. If you withdraw from Bitstamp you'll be getting a lot less than 1k.

To be honest, it's been a while since I used blockchain and I'm unavailable to login and check at the moment. I'll have an answer later today.

Terrible analogy aside, I completely agree it's like winning the lottery. There's been winners and losers in this "bitcoin bubble game." Like everyone else, I've got my hopes up. Especially with all the news about bitcoin ATMs, services and general adoption ramping up. But, like everyone else, I still completely understand this can all end tomorrow.

If you're in the US, I'd recommend coinbase.com. I've used them a few times, they accept credit cards now, I believe. If not, you can link your bank account info. I believe they've even recently lowered their minimum purchase amount as well, making a lot easier to buy in small increments. One thing to note, however, is that purchases through coinbase do take a couple of days to process.

I've only tried 3 others before, one of which is no longer in operation (bitfloor.com). Coinbase just seems like the easiest way to get into buying. Last I checked some other places require a Photo ID and possibly other paperwork along with various days of waiting for verification to go through. It may be different now,  someone correct me if I'm wrong. 
Also, Coinbase has a big enough user base that it's a lot less likely to just disappear, especially considering that they're actually making a profit. 
You'll generally get a good feel for who you should and shouldn't be doing business with just by reading the posts and comments here on the community. 
There have been some "hiccups" in the past regarding missing coins or delays from Coinbase, but they always seem to get resolved. From what I've seen, it also seems like they've got people reading posts here and helping people out when they're having issues and that, to me, shows dedication. So for now I'm sticking with them.

Glad I can be of help. But like anyone else here will tell you, "only invest what you're willing to lose." As much as we all think Bitcoin is great, there are still some very serious risks to consider. 
blockchain.info is really what I'd recommend for new users. Coinbase, although it can be used as a storage of some sort, should not really be used for that. It's been a while since I've used it but, I believe blockhain allows you to export either your private key or your wallet file so that in the case they should lose all their data or they disappear for whatever reason, you'd still be able to import your info into a software wallet. Here's some good info on different wallet types 
If I made it out to be like Coinbase is the only real alternative worth looking into, I didn't communicate myself as well as I intended. Coinbase is simply what I've experienced and what I've had a good history with. Others may have different views and opinions. It is simply what I choose to use and have personally deemed "safe."
One thing to note, if/when you do buy Bitcoins, from wherever, you'll want to send them to your blockchain.info address. Always copy, paste and then verify that it matches, never type in address manually since a single typo will send it into a different address and there's no getting it back.

You're probably kidding, but I'm gonna keep pretending you're delusional. It's hilarious!

It's probably because there are still a lot of people who aren't too sure it will take off at all. To a lot of people, including myself, this is all still one big gamble. 
The currency is still in its infancy and while it seems like its going really well, nobody really knows what will happen tomorrow. If the bitcoin value drops for whatever reason and people decide to abandon it, people will lose a lot of money.
It will take time but I hope that, just like the internet, it gets adopted by the masses.
