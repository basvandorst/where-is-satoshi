I would argue that bitcoin storage needs to be very user friendly in order for bitcoin to get wide spread adoption. What you describe is very confusing to a layman, hell even making an offline wallet would be too much for my dad to handle.
The only real solution I suppose in the future is got a trusted party to create wallets (prehaps a bitcoin bank) which would be fully transparent about their activities and liable under law for any misconduct which occurs.
On a somewhat relevant side note, I completely expect companies (btcbanks) to eventually pop up which offer a system where one could transfer BTC from one users btcbank to another without there ever being a transaction on the blockchain unless you were to "withdraw" the bank money to a personal address. 
This ofcourse would  be user friendly enough for your grandma to own btc and alleviate chargeback issue as the banks could refund the BTC, but one could also withdraw BTC and transfer that way. 
When this occurs I would expect a serious drop in needing to have paper wallet and trusted btcbanks would handle your money for you.

ya thats what I think would be its competitive advantage, since they are the biggest company in bitcoin atm they can act as VC for other start ups in the future.

This is more of a guideline than a law. It is directed at those new to BTC and the one's most likely to be scammed and there are many being scammed everyday on the forums. 
There have been people on the bitcointalk forums who run the long con and will build up their reputation in the community and then end up stealing from the community that trusted them.(see pirate/bakewell)
Also I did mention that as long as you do your due diligence you have nothing to worry about (and if something goes wrong its your fault). 
I personally own Asicminer shares, could friedcat run away with my money? Ya, sure but based on track record I am willing to take the risk.
The problem I see is that in the event of a scam there is little one can do to even try and receive justice, short of going to court or reporting to the police that your "virtual money" got stolen there isn't anything you can do.
My point really lies in the fact that, would you give someone your Visa/Debit pin or online banking password if they could make you a cooler looking card? No. 
Would you let a non-regulated guy (trusted or not) open you up a bank account (to which he may or may not know the password/pin)? No.

Well I wouldn't expect the dividends to always be this high. Personally I think (assuming equipment sales arn't going to be sustainable as difficulty increases) that ASICMINER is worth 5-6btc

Okay, lets say one day bitcoin is worth 10k + a piece or 100,000. Are you really comfortable with someone having access to your private key??
It takes less than 5 minutes to make a secure paper wallet and print it. This is not a trust issue, the ammount of security gained with your own made paper wallet vs. time to secure your paper wallet is well worth the 5 - 10 minute time investment.
You don't have to take my advice ofcourse, but I will post this up here for everyone else that uses a service like houstonbits because I know I personally trust myself more than anyone else.

safety deposit box with paper wallet
new paper wallet every 2 weeks - month
if price of bitcoin goes up split you bitcoins into a proportionate number of wallets.
that is what I plan to do
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:37:14
This is common practice for all exchanges yea?
Edit: Nvm pulled the trigger worked as expected thanks

Lets run a little thought experiment here. 
Inflationary (I) vs. Deflationary Currency (D) (10%).
For Super wealthy (A), Wealthy (B), Middle Class (C), Poor (D), Dirt poor (E)
Percentages and time frame of I/D are exaggerated. # used as not based on any "currency" just
numerical values used to make a point.
Inflation (10% a year) :
Year 1.
Man A has income $100,000 of (I) and requires 20,000 of (I) to live for 1 year.
Thus in Year 2 he has $80,000 saved.
$80,000 now has an approximate buying power of $72000 in Year 2.
To make the 8,000 loss the man needs to make $8900 in investments.
to make the 20,000 expense he needs to make ~ $31111 or 38.88888889 (% of net worth)
Fill in the rest yourself with the table I made
Inflation|	Income |	Expense per year|	Net Worth Year|	Buying Power of net worth	|How much money has to be earned from investments to retain Net worth buying power|	How much money has to be earned from investments to retain income buying power 	|% of networth to required buying power |

This is a very misleading comment. 1 BTC is the 48 h low, the average price was was most defiantly quite a bit higher. 
But the sentiment of how sustainable it is may be a valid criticism , however I would argue that is in fact worth more than it is selling for today based on further growth (as asicminer not only mines but sells equipment).
For those who are considering investing, yes the price could go down but if you do your due dilienge on the company you will see they around value higher than the current price.
Just like bitcoin the price could go down but eventually it will rise to a stable level which I believe is higher than it's currently selling at. Just cause it may go down doesn't mean you shouldn't buy shares now if you (like myself) think it is worth more than it is trading.

Do you make your own paper wallet and houstonbits send 10 btc to your public key?. If not I'd take all ur btc out of those wallets and into ur own secure paper wallet
@_date: 2013-05-17 23:47:27
I wish I knew about bitcoin that long ago.
In the coming years we should see many companies IPO and if due diligence is employed it is likely we will all be rich :D

good news :), glad I held through my first roller-coaster 
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:51:13
haha a part of me wanted to sell at 110 so I wouldn't "lose" money and then buy in later, but I figured why would I risk possibly having less bitcoins to my name when I buy back in. 
If I believe in bitcoin enough to want to buy back in at some point later, I believe enough to hold.
Its exciting to say the least ahah
