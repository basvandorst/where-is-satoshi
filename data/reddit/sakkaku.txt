Good rack mount enclosures are comparatively more expensive.   Plus you can achieve better cooling by using side fans or taking the side off.

- People often times use the same password on websites as their email.
- Compromising an email account grants you access to 100s of websites (most let you reset via email)
- You get a nice history of someones activity on the internet
- Breach paypal, bank, etc for $$$

You do realize that a keylogger defeats the purpose of encryption right?  You need 2 factor authentication where one of the methods isn't easily stolen just like the wallet.  And an antivirus does nothing to stop programs that do bad things because it is largely based on a blacklist.

Who is to say they didn't "leak" the information to their buddy?  This is why security audits are a joke if handled improperly.

ps3 has a lot of floating point power, which is why it was decent at folding.    Bitcoin is almost entirely integer math.

Alright so you want to hire a consultant to review your code. 
1) you are giving an unknown quantity acess to the full source code and probably the server itself. 
2) now you have someone with access to your database, dwolla API keys, and bitcoind
3) you have to trust them immensely to not run off with thousands to millions in assets.
even if you censor out information a little social engineering or inserting your own exploits while 'fixing' the code and bam, more $$$ for you.

The average user has minimal common sense on the internet.  And they are the ones who will be hurt the worst.

The client will show it once it finishes updating the blockchain.  
If you keep the client open 24/7 it will usually show up within a minute at worst.

I believe it was the developer of bitcoinj (who works for google) grabbed the list of gmail accounts and added additional security.  Facebook has also been known to lock accounts that are compromised in email/pass releases.

You might have tried to make a payment to the [mybitcoin]( payment processor.
1) Make sure your client is connected.  The processor will probably refund your coins since the transaction timed out.  Or the client might have cancelled the transaction itself.
2) If not go back to the website and see what processor it was (since I might be wrong) and contact them with your payment address and amount.  Chances are they will refund you once they look into things.

mybitcoin offers a merchant api similar to paypal.  It gives you an address to pay, sends you to a waiting page, then redirects back to the website once the transaction has started.  I only tried one transaction with it but it seems simpler than interacting with bitcoind.

PHP is also well know for producing tons of people who know nothing about preventing SQL injection, much less any other forms of attack.

You only need to store the wallet.dat to recover your coins down the road.

The passwords will be brute forced.  You are retarded if you think someone wont try.
1764 / 59252 are MD5 hashes, that take a minimal amount of CPU power to crack.

The problem with security is that you genuinely need to understand how an exploit works in order to understand how to protect against it.
Most places people learn to program barely even cover the basics.  Even the classes you take in college are lol.  I think I had one class that went over SQL injection for a few minutes out of the semester.  'Security' classes focus mainly on network attacks (man in the middle, replay, etc) and encryption rather then actual decent practices.  If I was a teacher I would fail &gt;90% of the students at my college.
Then you have to factor in server hardening on top of crappily written applications and there is little wonder people are leery.

I don't get why people are so retarded in this subreddit.
I posted [this]( and got laughed at.  The the exact thing happened abeit outside of the specified criteria (or is it?).  State the truth, get downvoted.

if you are asking for a script you are doing it wrong.
Do you know about hardening a server? 
Protecting against SQL injection and xss attacks?
There is more to running a service than throwing up a script and collecting profits.

You can do ACH transfers in the US between accounts for no cost.  The problem arises when you need to send funds to a different person.

They have a Windows and OSX build which work ok.  
But they could really do with some form of code signing.  Windows 8 and new(est) versions of OSX you need to go through hoops to actually run it.

Virwox has a funky trading system that doesn't allow partial amounts for L$ &lt;-&gt; BTC.  Between that and large fees to withdraw money it is something to know going in.
