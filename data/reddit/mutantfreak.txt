You're not answering my question. My question is very simple...
Have you looked for evidence that European-derived populations are also at higher genetic risk for certain psychiatric disorders? It seems like a pretty important search if you're shaping your world view partially on genetic studies. If so, what psychiatric disorders are European-derived population at higher genetic risk?
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:05:25
Only cherry picked genetic studies confirm your bias. You already admitted you "didn't know" whether your not you searched for studies that contradict your world view. You're a stereotypical racist. Incapable of critical thinking.

You've shown you lack enough critical thinking skills to engage in a productive debate. If you can deduce whether or not genetic studies support your worldview by doing an proper lit review I will have some more faith that you can be taught. Until then, I'm going to keep repeating this statement.

You wrote "I don't take you for someone who looks at demographic trends, crime statistics, or genetics studies". But we already uncovered that you don't really look at genetics studies either. You couldn't confirm whether or not you looked at genetic studies that would contradict your claims. I'm satisfied with the insight I was seeking as to how/why people think as you do. It's some sort of willful ignorance where I end up pointing out the most basic logical fallacies like "confirmation bias". Not very insightful, unfortunately.

Nobody knows what will happen with bitcoin. I personally think it has a much greater chance of success than failure, but we must entertain the possibility that bitcoin will crash back to the hundreds of worse. If we don't do that then we lack imagination and may gamble more than we can afford to lose. There are no guarantees in investment vehicles. There are only bets we make that tend to pay off more than 50% of the time.

You "forgot" if you looked it up? Oh man. I had to repeat the question this many times for you to state that you simply "forgot"? Well, buddy you should remember such an important search. See, there's this thing called "confirmation bias" where people without critical thinking skills tend to seek out and remember evidence that supports their world view. They either don't bother to search or simply "forget" any evidence that contradicts their world view. You should keep yourself form making any dumb claims if your selective memory keeps you from remember whether or not you searched for evidence that disproves your worldview.

No, you look at genetic studies that confirm your political views. There's a difference. One falls for confirmation bias, the other does not.


That's right, because someone who only looks for genetic studies that confirm their political views and "don't know" whether or not they've looked for genetic studies that contradict their political views is not worthy of my time. My goal is not to educate you nor was it to debate you as my equal. I won't stoop. My goal was to investigate whether you were misinterpreting genetic studies, in which case I would have educated you. Instead, you don't even remember if you looked up genetic studies that contradict your world view so misinterpreting them is not the problem. Confirmation bias is.

I understand what you're saying. The honest answer is that I don't know. I'm ignorant regarding why/how people maintained their in that environment. It's very possible that fiat increases the velocity of money and encourages investment and that this offsets the unfavorable advantages of printing new money. If I had the proper amount of time this is something I'd like to research as well as an impact analysis to understand the effects of printing new money on the economy. It's entirely possible that abandoning fiat will do more harm than good for all I know. I romanticize the notion of stripping away the advantage of powers that benefit tremendously from newly printed money. It could even the playing field in isolated industries, but I don't know for a fact that it would have an overall net positive for the economy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:26:35

It's weird to refer to bitcoin as succeeding of failing. It either has adoption or doesn't. People are either willing to pay plenty for some bitcoin or they're not. It's decentralized so there can be no mission statement. Even bitcoin's creator doesn't have control at this point and whatever hopes he had for bitcoin are irrelevant. It belongs to us all and it belongs to no one. It can't succeed and it can't fail. It can only be used widely or not be used at all.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:14:57
I agree that the volatility is a temporary problem. Even if 90% is speculation, that 10% will grow and grow over time, but only if people can use Bitcoin without waiting too long and without high fees. I'm more worried about those two factors than anything else. It just seems like no matter what, this thing will grow. Let's say that Argentina or Venezuela citizens start using this thing en masse. How will this affect transaction times? Will the bitcoin core client be so huge that people have to buy a 1 or 2 or 10 TB drive to be able to run it? What effect is the current cost and speed of transactions having on adoption? Will it always be choking the tech so that it never gets used on day to day purchases? All questions I don't expect anyone to be able to answer, but these are my fears. That being said, I love the tech and I hope it succeeds fabulously. I just don't share in the blind optimism (although I never thought it'd make it to 4k either)
@_date: 2018-03-28 18:40:15
People who voluntarily use bitcoin pay for the bitcoin network. It's decentralized for a reason. You say fees make a small percentage of revenue for the banks and I say you missed my point completely. Who cares what percentage of revenue fees make up for the bank? They hurt the poor disproportionately just the same, which was my point. I know how banks make their money. I also know that you will cause a crash if you run in and make ANY major change from one day to the next like eliminating the ability to loan money. We can have an orderly transition to a better system over time if one did emerge.

@_date: 2018-03-30 17:42:47


You need money to benefit from the banking system. Other people are paying in some shape way or form for all your advantages.


What's wrong with banks? It's not the mere existence of banks that hurts the poor. It's the policies, most of which would not be possible with non-fiat currency. Can you imagine how loans would work in bitcoin? People would actually have to part ways with actual bitcoin because they can't create some out of thin air for a loan.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:04:55
The fact that someone else is paying for this system should be something you care about. I'm not saying you should decide solely based on this. Perhaps you go with banks at the end of the day and shun bitcoin, but you should care SOME that your "free" service is being paid by a combination of backdraft fees by the poor among other things
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:36:51
You don't understand something. It's not possible for them to MAINTAIN control because they inevitably have to part with bitcoin via various means. They can't print more. They have to earn more the second time around. Fractional reserve lending is not possible with bitcoin because to lend it, someone else has to part with it
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:40:26
I love the idea if bitcoin, but I'm worried about how slow the transactions are, how much transactions cost, and how much worse this will get as more people try to use bitcoin. Also, isn't it the case that the vast majority of people who own bitcoin just hold on to it rather than actually purchase goods and services with it? That's worrying as well.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:15:53
I want to believe, but allow me to play the devil's advocate. "Lots of people use it to buy things". It's not that we need "lots of people" to buy things with it. What proportion is this? Is it as low as 10%? If so, up to 90% of the value may be easily wiped out and volatility will continue.
How do you figure slow transactions and high cost for transactions will fade out as bitcoin grows? Won't this make the problem worse? What happens when bitcoin core requires a terabyte to store? 10 TB?


This is a belief. Let's talk logic and facts.

Agree 100%


Hmm, what about people who don't have capital to invest? Which system will benefit people living paycheck to paycheck? I think a deflationary currency would help these people along in a world that is rapidly increasing total production and thus the available wealth.


I disagree. Getting extremely low interest loans and then investing it in the market is a hybrid. On one hand, it is tied to an increase in production, but on the other hand, it's money that was attained by already having money. This ultimately hurts poor people living paycheck to paycheck who wouldn't be able to get that extremely low interest loan that they can then throw into a Vanguard mutual fund. The rich getting richer seems to me a result of inflationary currency.


While technically true, this oversimplifies the process of wealth distribution. Even if there is more wealth to distribute and the poor get a tiny taste, where is all the new wealth going? Is the gap between rich and poor growing? Why? Are they working harder? Are they more clever? Perhaps, it's none of those things. Perhaps, they are able to get richer by already being rich. We can explore the consequences of this if you like, but I propose that getting richer by virtue of already being rich does more harm than good.

Bitcoin is decentralized meaning that people have to switch over to the new fork and this ensures bitcoin devs can't just force changes that people don't want. There will only ever be 21 Million bitcoins.

21 Million Bitcoin were created out of thin air ONCE. You have to have a currency exist to use it. There's nothing wrong with creating it once. Can't use it if it doesn't exist.


You're not getting my point. There is no way to just *poof* create bitcoin to lend out from central banks. While p2p lending or other central-based lending is a possibility, someone has to actually part with their bitcoin and take all of the risk. Lending would work differently as a result... very differently.


Not necessarily. Like any system, it has its upside and its downside. I'm not fully convinced that the current system is that awful.


The power to take advantage of recently created currency is an AWESOME power to have. Central banks have that power. Theoretically, bitcoin will make sure that nobody has this power. So it's not just movement of money from one group to another, it's destroying the ring of power. Every time money is created it's no different than taking money from everyone's bank account and giving it to those who have early access to this newly created money (banks and corporations). This makes money flow to those who already have money. This would also end.


Sure, it's not an "end all be all" solution to society's ills. It does help in that it ensures that nobody can benefit from currency pulled out of thin air, which is always going to disproportionately be the ultra rich.


It's a false dichotomy. Will the man's strength go from 100% to 66%? Will it go from 100% to 95%? It's not like the man is either there or not there. It's how much power "the man" has to maintain your analogy.

If it's not the government, the fact that it's "China" is irrelevant. Why not just say 70% of the world's miners? You do realize that 100% of the world's miners may get together and destroy bitcoin by shutting down their nodes, right? You seem to have a problem with mining farms, not "China".


Have you done any research on this? You sound a bit paranoid. Do you know how many individual mining farms would be needed to form a conspiracy to try and create more bitcoins than 21 Million? It just takes one to sound the alarm. Have you thought about the workarounds even if it did happen, like rolling back such a change and forking it? It's a decentralized open ledger. Any such changes can be rolled back. You seem to be sounding off a series of "what ifs" without much backing.


I'm glad you've changed your mind. You were pretty concerned at the beginning of our discussion. As I said earlier, there will only ever be 21 Million bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:36:14


No, bitcoin is real now. You're just throwing random stuff against the wall to see if anything sticks, using my knowledge of bitcoin to debunk your "what ifs".


I never made this claim.


I don't follow your logic.


This is false. Banks would not control the money supply in the case of bitcoin. Nobody would because there will only ever be 21 Million bitcoins. That is the benefit of decentralization. Power is not concentrated to a room full of bankers.


The word "possible" has a very low barrier for entry. It's possible a comet will destroy the earth in the next 5 minutes. We have to make judgement calls based on what's likely to occur.


I disagree. I encourage you to get educated on how bitcoin works on a deeper level.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:57:56
What is the obsession with labeling. You know what Bitcoin IS without applying a label.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:53:37


Anybody who claim there is a real possibility of there ever being more than 21 Million bitcoins is feeding you FUD. The fact that you cling to this exposes just how disconnected you are from what Bitcoin is and how it works. The fixed number of bitcoins is THE  selling point for the tech.


That's what is meant by having control over the currency. The people who use it get to vote on forks.


That's absurd. The Chinese government doesn't control over 51% of the nodes. It's not like the government of China itself has the hashing power. It's a lot of individual miners in individual pools. Would you be so concerned if the US citizens had over 51% of the hashing power?


Bitcoin is not a monopoly. It's a decentralized peer to peer store of value and/or currency. The second you identify a monopoly forming you let met us all here in know, ok?
Your level of expertise on bitcoin is nowhere near your level of conviction.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:24:07


Neither am I, at least not completely. There are reasons to think it would be.


It doesn't matter if your money is under your mattress. The second more money is created out of thin air it still loses buying power. You're still part of any system as long as you own its currency.


That's because it won't be pulled out of thin air. There will only ever be 21 Million bitcoins ever created and that's it. Forks fall into the category of competing cryptocurrencies. There is Ethereum, Litecoin, and over a thousand others, but they're still not creating anymore bitcoins.


I don't get your point.


You're not actually making any points. You're just making an assertion in stating "that's not how the world has been shown to work".


Incorrect. There is tremendous power in being able to create money out of thin air. It's an implicit tax on everyone holding the currency and it leads to accumulation of wealth for those with this power and their contacts. Bitcoin destroys this power so that nobody has it. It's a move in the right direction in terms of making sure there is no accumulation of undue currency printing power.


I don't understand what you're asking.


I'm not saying "one would be better than the other". I'm saying if we're talking about the ability to print money out of thin air, then nobody will have this undue power. It's a step towards more fairness but not a complete solution, by any means.


We have power over fiat and the power to not rely on fiat. There are some people who want something less prone to manipulation and that would make it impossible to print money out of thin air. I see bitcoin as one way in which we're exercising control over fiat... by abandoning it to some extent.

It's not really useful to say you disagree or try and give me a literature assignment to uncover the complexities about why you disagree. If the reason you disagree is so damn complex that it requires reading a book to comprehend then it's more like indoctrination. State your reasons why you disagree or go away. No problem having my ideas challenged but it's not productive to say "I disagree, bye!"

We can agree that the lightning network will hopefully make it possible to spend and buy bitcoin without worrying about the size of the blockchain.
You're missing my point regarding the velocity of bitcoin. It doesn't change current hodling behavior. It's meant to create pressure to use bitcoin more than it's currently being used to gain awareness and reliance.
Sounds like it goes against the narrative of people telling others to buy bitcoin and hold onto it because it's scarce. I don't really care about that. I just want to see bitcoin used and people being more and more aware. I do believe if more merchants relied on it then we'd see demand and price of bitcoin increase.
I still maintain my original position on what should be done.
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:42:19
Let's dissect your statements.


There are workarounds, like lightning network.


I don't understand what your point is about bad money being driven out by the good. You just made a statement there without saying much about my proposals or why they're so damaging.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:31:17
I disagree with you as well.
@_date: 2018-12-02 03:24:08
I still disagree.

Why do you need bitcoin? Well, technically it's not a need. More like, do you want shit to be more affordable? I don't know if you've ever owned a business but if you had you'd know just how high merchant fees can get. There's a whole industry waiting for their share of your money whenever you buy anything using a credit card. Walmart, McDonalds, and other corporations with leverage pay virtually no merchant fee overhead so it fucks the little guy. Imagine if you could drastically reduce the merchant fee overhead. You wouldn't just create an even playing field but you'd also make things cheaper. The more you use bitcoin the cheaper things get for everyone. By not using bitcoin you're giving a significant percentage of every single purchase to the finance industry. Merchants simply raise the price of all their goods to compensate.
That's only one of the benefits. There are countless others. Bitcoin is a new tool for doing business. This new technology enables things that have been historically intractable like virtual elimination of merchant fees.

They're not mutually exclusive. Seems rather obvious to me that none of the proposals I listed would hurt the efforts to make it a global store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:10:19
I don't understand the harm that would come from merchants accepting it. You said my proposals were damaging. Sounds like you just don't think they'd work as opposed to them being damaging.

Glenn Beck is a hysterical idiot. There is not one shred of integrity in the entire man's body. Don't listen to a word he has to say. He represents noise not sound.
