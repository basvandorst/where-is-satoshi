It will be like this: you will buy at 10k, watch your investment disappear while BTC keeps falling down, sell at 5k, watch it  skyrocket to 25k and buy back because of FOMO. Rinse and repeat.
Trying to time the market is gambling. It is a classic trap for day trader- wannabes. Why not to buy more at 5k? Because psychological pressure is enormous. Everything and everyone will be saying that the Bitcoin is dead, it is over, bubble is bursting.

Check bitstamp subreddit- it is chaos now, everyone panicking, people can't get their money. You might want to thank your bank. For saving your money from disaster.
In EU I'd say go with Kraken, slow as shit but one of the most regulated and reliable.

Well it should not be a big deal to get such translation. I mean it depends on how much you want to invest. If it is &gt;1000$ I'd say reliability&gt;ease of confirmation.

Eli5 What are the benefits of a bigger blocks against segwit? It has been answered thousand times, but I'm lazy...

You don't need to, kraken was fair and credited everyone who had Bitcoins on kraken with bch. I already sold mine

And if you bet on the coins to go tremendously up why not just buy the coins and spare the hassle with mining?

It's called a hobby.

Can anyone eli5 why the price is supposed to be connected with the difficulty/miners at all? Is it not enough (theoretically) to have just one miner to keep the block chain working? can't wrap my head around it

"It's just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed," Dimon said Tuesday at the Delivering Alpha conference 
It will be closed? Does he even understands the decentralized concept?

This!!! Everyone who lives in the country with FIFO taxation should do that. Also if the price rebounds later this year, don't forget to sell and rebuy some part - just enough to cover the losses you realized now. This part of the growth will be tax free for you!

What would be a smart way to cash out? Asking for a friend...
