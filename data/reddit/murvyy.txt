Thank you for your comment buddy. Honestly, I don't think I would be able to make it in the business I want to do only accepting Bitcoin, since everybody else takes credit card. I think it would take many years to establish enough of a reputation that I could make any real money that way.
I will consider that possibility though, if there aren't any other options.

Really? Is there a guide you know of that will teach me how to do this?

Well, it does have something to do with Bitcoin, because in part of my question, I asked if there could be some kind of service which processes the credit card payments and transfers the money into a Bitcoin account.

Just admit you wrote a dumb comment. It's not "shady" if I have no intent on doing anything unethical.

Right, because the only reason a person would want to protect his identity when selling goods/services is so he can scam people. Just like the only reason someone would use Bitcoin is if they're doing something wrong.

If I was to use Paypal, is doing something illegal the *only* way that my name could be discovered by anyone in the public?

Well, I'm open to this being less than 100% anonymous. I'm not doing anything fraudulent, so I'm not too worried about my information being subpoenaed from anyone (unless it's a result of the anonymity somehow creating the belief that I am in fact doing something illegal).
Basically I just don't want the public to find out about my business. I am a public figure, and I think that being in this business would harm my career and influence, so I want it to be a secret.
If the money is going from the merchant to my bank account, do you know if the bank would be able to know about my website and/or the service/goods being sold? (stupid question?)
Honestly I'm really clueless about this stuff. Does anyone know if my personal info held by the merchant or the bank could legally be made publicly available?
Thanks, M

I just want to update and say I think a better question for me to ask is: How can I receive credit card payments on my website, without my connection to that website/it's products becoming known to the public?
Do I actually need to use any special protection to do this? Or could I just use a normal credit card merchant and my regular bank?

I would ask you to logically explain why you think that is unethical, and I doubt anything worth reading would come of it.
And I've actually only been on reddit for 2 days...I don't know why it says 8.

Why are you doing this? Other people here are actually trying to be helpful, and you just keep writing negative things on my thread that don't make any sense.
Money Laundering:
"The process of taking the proceeds of criminal activity and making them appear legal."
What are you getting out of this? What do you have against me? Or do you do this to everyone? Did you interpret the humility in my original post as vulnerability?
