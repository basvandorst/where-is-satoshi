If any of you ever considered investing their bitcoins in stocks, I'm glad to share some additional info:
[ :
\+ One of the best apps out there (but charts are very basic, no indicators). Deposit/Trading/Withdrawal worked fine so far.
\- Shady. When I asked their Telegram support group (looks like it was one man show at that time) if they are regulated, he responded that they are registred in somewhere like BVI. When I kept asking if they have any license to do money business or trade stocks he told me that no one is forcing me to use their services. When I asked what exactly stops them from pulling out an exit scam, he blocked me. When I escalated the situation and my question if they are regulated to one of the founders via Telegram, he blocked me too :-)
\[Update\] When you press 'Legal' in their Android app, instead of any legal info its sends your logs somewhere :-) (you need to press it multiple times)
[ :
\+ I had not found any
\- Their App looks like it was made in 80s, after latest update I do not see an option to buy stocks anymore
[ :
\+ Nice web app, deposit/trading/withdrawal worked fine so far.
\- Shady. Despite the fact that they required their users to pass KYC, the owners prefer to stay anonymous :-)

2 more facts about [currency.com]( which will tell you a lot of what kind of organization they are:
1) I made one of the deposits, it had been confirmed on the blockchain but not visible in my [currency.com]( wallet. When I contacted support, they told me that the guy in charge of deposites has already left the office and will proceed my deposit the next day :-)
2) Now their support, in addition to confirmation of the funds origin, requested me to confirm that my withdrawal btc address belongs to me. Still awaiting their clarification how exactly I'm supposed to do that

Mycelium is a scam, Google about their ICO before using them
