Remember, never sell when you're afraid the price has dipped to much, it will recover over time. I bought my first fraction of a Bitcoin back on my 16th birthday in October when the price was hovering around $600. I just got in the habit of putting my spare money from selling candy at school into Bitcoin instead of buying video games. Much more rewarding to see your investment change price everyday. 
If you have a smartphone, download a Bitcoin ticker widget or app. Check it daily and you'll get use to the trends the price follows.

Still doing it myself, ten times better pay than working minimum wage every night, so much more fun as well.

I try to. I every new trend I try to hop on quick, buy some stock and sell as quickly as possible. For example, during our school's prom I noticed a ton of guy's buying new watches. I went to the discount store and bought a bunch of watches for $5 each. Managed to flip them for a nice profit. 
Also managed to sell internet throughout the school at one stage. School blocked mobile phone connections to the wifi network so I set up a few data boxes throughout the school and sold packages for an amount of data. Was a lot of maintenance so eventually moved on from that.
Fidget spinners, cubes, candy, internet, google cardboard, trading cards, video games, Mother's/Father's Day presents, watches, discounted Spotify subscriptions. I've tried it all and I ain't stopping anytime soon :)

It's interesting to watch. Over time you can begin to see the trends of the price, which helps when you're buying more.
