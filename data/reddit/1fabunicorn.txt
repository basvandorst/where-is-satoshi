I wish they accepted visa debit gift cards :  (
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:09:00
this is actualy really smart and ironic. Will do
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:23:51
Yeah you need to hold your ID next to the card, while taking a selfie. 
One, I'm under 18 so I don't have an state or government ID, 
Two... I think the reason why they do that is to check if the name on the card matches your ID. There is no name on the gift card so idk what they would say. Otherwise, there's only one way to find out! 
@_date: 2016-04-24 04:25:54
apparently its back up... 
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:02:02
I'm 15! And me and my Friend are starting to mine!!! Yay 
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:49:56


Sums it up
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:21:04
Well... Let's role back time! Technicaly with voting it would be okay but it's still a strange idea

this is to funny 
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:53:47
Not sure you kissed much, it does really suck. 
But you can find places on local Bitcoin that do sell without id with a bank deposit 
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:03:25
Ironically they probably use the funds and use the mixing service they are impersonating to get them to a central address.   
@_date: 2016-02-05 11:40:00
wouhhhhhh how could it ever?!
@_date: 2016-02-03 23:49:39
lol we all get spammed by someone about ethereum I don't think anyone want to talk about it
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:15:06
Didn't we partially fix this by using barcodes with your address? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:20:19
haha. and girls! 
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:15:59
Super cool! I am gonna learn more about this. looks pretty old but still interesting
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:14:55
But you have to admit its an interesting response if its true he said that.
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:37:49
Haha seriously. But imo, they think *everything* is related to national security. It's thrown around like a buzzword
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:18:49
Like I have always thought that they are extremely smart economically and sociologically, but I personally don't like there software. 
but now... hmmm yay
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:43:40
I am 16 and I got into bitcoin by mining! It also teaches me a bunch about cryptography because I want to major in that 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:20:54
I am confused how you got the scam site from the actual clearnet site. Was the clearnet site a scam too? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:13:57
I understand now. I am sorry that hapend to you. 
Can you see the address you sent the coins to? I wonder how successful they have been at doing this
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:17:51
Can you explain what this is? 
@_date: 2016-09-25 14:38:02
We sell cryptos is good. They have 15 usd limit unless you verify with an id
@_date: 2016-09-28 02:27:38
@_date: 2016-02-19 20:18:14
or you can use electrum. I am pretty sure that you can turn of the internet on your computer and you won't connect to a node but itl still generate the private key. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:44:50
I saw. Pretty interesting how much things changed
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:09:25
im 16, and I use localbitcoins and buy using a deposit. I do live in the us so it could be different for you 
@_date: 2015-11-16 16:11:47
So with lightning your not putting any trust on an individual service, more trusting the sha code thing and the various levels of encryption security? 
@_date: 2016-10-04 01:31:39
check sum of the whole index.html stylesheet.css, and javascript.js? or just individual quote context? If its the whole site, fine. but what if they change anything. 
Personally, I do think this is a great idea for the quotess
@_date: 2015-11-16 15:39:20
obviously there is lots for me to learn. i found [this]( article explaining it in some way I slightly understand. The main thing I got was 




If bitcoin was to become the new worldwide currency, we would obviously need more then 7 transactions per second. 
One more point right here


This is definitely a great way to decrease the size of the ledger, *but* isn't the idea of bitcoin that it is not controlled by a individual networks, kinda transferring over to the idea of a **government** currency?
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:00:02
Hey, I straght up stumbled upon this exchange 
I talked with there chat customer service, and it seems they do except gift cards. 
If you use this place, tell me how it goes! 
@_date: 2015-11-16 14:07:39
this is soo cool!!! I didn't even know you can make an amount of bitcoin unspendable intil a amount of time. Kinda makes sence though. 
let say Samantha wants to send .5 btc to Dan. Dan wants proof that Samantha has the .5 btc so she sends them to him via a escrows that's built upon the coin itself? 
@_date: 2016-05-12 18:29:51
Well, you already have possibly one customer while I'm at school down here. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 01:16:41
for hells sake lol. I woulda used it but I don't have identification docs. Pretty cool you can buy ltc with fiat tho
@_date: 2016-05-10 14:19:59
Anyone know if a minor could get one of these? Or would I need to register it in my dads name? 
@_date: 2016-05-15 15:36:55
What's the prices look like? I'm away from my computer 
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:39:38
For some reason I found this extremely funny 
@_date: 2016-05-10 19:04:54
problem is I don't have a government issued ID. I wonder if my highschool ID would work. Probably not. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:15:36
There is an interesting parallel I have seen recently relating to cryptocurrency and web anonymity (tor). Right now, many of the horrible things people are doing are used through these services because of how safe(and to our unbenefit, anonymous) 
This is the future, but thats just one little thing i've noticed.
*Thoughts* 
@_date: 2016-05-16 01:06:22
yeh but its still very positive to btc future
@_date: 2016-05-10 01:17:29
very helpful

@_date: 2015-11-16 12:55:35
I'm new to the art of coining, (haha) can someone explain what this is? 
I'm guessing it has something to do with how blocks are read between peers 
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:33:13
I've tried, and they denied the card. Best bet is trying out purse. I bought around 72 usd using 100 usd on there using a pre-paid visa gift card
@_date: 2016-05-12 18:27:52
You're absolutely correct. Its actualy really silly because that is pretty much the best rate available for gift cards. Like on local bitcoins the rate is about 600 ish per btc, and on purse its 530
@_date: 2016-05-09 11:06:36
get the private key QR code tattooed really small somewhere silly on your body instead?
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:21:12
@_date: 2016-05-18 01:45:39
I am curious into this too
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:25:46
yup. Its what eventually happens to all of us
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:50:43
ayyyy
