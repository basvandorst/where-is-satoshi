Say I let you store your bicycle in my garage, and someone else stores their watch in my safe.  Some jackass breaks into the garage and steals your bike.   We're friends.   Do you expect me to sell our buddy's watch from my safe to pay for your bicycle?    I don't think so.   
You can certainly make a case (depending on the structure of the holdings and the venue) that certain options may not be legally permissible, but don't make it about ethics.

Except that people make choices in evaluating risk.    Bitcoin is more risky than USD.   Lending USD (which is affected by what they've proposed) had a risk reward (what percentage do you loan at, for how long).   I'm not sure how they're going to deal with lawsuits and potential bankruptcy courts, but in terms of simple fairness, its really not fair that those who took different risks are subject to the same impact.

Been watching all day.   This is the moment you've crossed into sounding too much like gox did before they went under.  It really does matter, or it really doesn't matter, depending on what you "decide".
If individual account separations are to be honored, then yes it matters very much.   If the risk of holding USD which remained safe in your bank account is different than the risk of holding BTC which was not safe, then it matters whether you had USD, BTC, ETH, etc.
But if you're about to declare bankruptcy and put us all through a lengthy process of trustees, expensive consulting firms, lawsuits, and ambiguous settlement terms, then it really does not matter.   If we're all just fucked to the same degree regardless of what risks we were taking with our respective currencies, then probably its time to just give patent answers and avoid the lead on.

Really this will be decided on what is considered legal in HK and based on how they structured the holdings.    
Consider that its also 'unfair' for someone holding only USD to be at the same risk of someone holding BTC, which are more easily stolen.   Would it really be fair to use my dollars to buy your stolen Bitcoins back?
I made an analogy yesterday about a bicycle in a garage and a watch in a safe.   Two friends store their stuff at your house, bike gets stolen, watch stays safe.   Do you sell other friend's watch to cover the portion of the stolen bike?   I don't think its intuitively "fair" for that to happen. 
Now it may or may not be a legal requirement, which is a different matter entirely.

Plenty of risks are unknown unknowns.   One would assume ETH and LTC were just as equally easy to steal.  Either there was something different, or the thief didn't consider it worth the effort.    But there could be other risks.   The fact that ETC is still around is a good example.   That's something which could easily burn an exchange.  
Again I'm not even speaking off legalities, that could be a whole different reality.    But in terms of basic fairness, would a bitcoin holder feel fair covering losses due to mishandling of an Ethereum fork?

This actually made sense to me immediately when I read your version of events.   Bob wanted to have another hacker involved as a plausible cover.   He seems to have fumbled badly in executing that plan, but I suspect it was his main reason for selling the credentials.   He never guessed Rovion would get in touch with you.   
This also explains  ...  he'd want to make sure Rovion took the deal and went through with the hack.    Plus it might mean he didn't have to offer much proof of his ability and willingness to deliver.
I think Emin's analysis could have been interesting food for thought.  Nobody should take things at face value.   But he does go WAY too far into the weeds on pure speculation for his own theories to be credible.   Viral marketing?   C'mon.    There's no way in hell this was positive for Shapeshift.   Being down at a point in time when there was a lot of BTC/ETH trading going?    And I personally have a project that I am strongly reconsidering using the shapeshift API for as it reminded my why I don't like relying on external parties.    100% this hack lost money, and opportunity for Shapeshift. 
Critizing on lack of humility is also insane.   He's gone with err on the side of full transparency beyond what might even be good strategy.

Can you please expand on this?      To be clear, my thinking was that a recipient of a UTXO could create a child transaction which competes for placement in the block using escalating fees.    In the case of SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, would this not require the original sender to set SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY for the UTXO recipient to increase the fee?   If so this isn't that useful as it is difficult to enforce for regular users.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 06:18:43
Yes but if the original transaction from the customer has to include SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, it is not realistic.   Not all wallets will make it easy to set, most legit customers will not do it.   With CPFP the recipient can simply create a new output with the higher fee.

If you're doing trading or arbitrage, to take advantage of the size of capital you need to put it at risk.   Because of regulations, established markets are able to keep that risk mostly tied to the risks of the position you are taking.  This kind of counter-party risk with MtGox would be very unusual in regulated securities, fx, etc.   
Those of you who pride yourself on staying safe by staying out of the market, you should know that your dollar/eur/whatever price you think of your BTC in exists only because of those willing to trade volume, ie take that counter-party risk.

American living in Japan here.   ATM machines in Japan only spit out 10000 yen notes (~ US$100).   Everyone uses cash.   The smallest bill is 1000jpy (~ US$10), and the next denomination is a 500yen coin.   No nasty wrinkly gooey $1 bills.   No problems spending the cash, even machines generally take all denominations.   
I've become accustomed to this system and now its very strange to visit the US and see people pulling out a credit card for tiny transactions.   I tried using $100 bills and it was nearly impossible.  NO ONE had change, even vendors at the airport.   Everyone looks at you like you're nuts for not pulling out a credit card or some gnarly old $20s.

Willy was buying bitcoins at any price.   Other people were buying them cheap at other exchanges, selling at MtGox, withdrawaling (in JPY), and moving the money around to the cheaper exchange.   Rinse repeat.
MtGox did not separate people's cash into individual accounts.  It was all in their own account.   This means there was a draw down of up to 100 million JPY per day (about $1m usd at the time).   This does not count anyone foolish enough to deposit fiat at the time.
So that's where the fiat went.  The arbitragers withdrew it legitimately. 
The real question is why didn't MtGox react when they saw their cash reserves dwindling?   Their bank was closing their account because of the rate it was shrinking.    
I believe the answer is in part that they had for a long time realized they did not have enough cash for everyone to withdrawal at once, and thus were basically ignoring the shortfall with the plan to somehow make enough profit to become whole again.  Despite the fact their their own terms of service said they would hold all customer funds in full.  
So..fraud/ponzi on top of massive incompetence.

Most Japanese never heard of bitcoin until the MtGox news blew up.   Almost none of the MtGox customers where Japanese.
I knew about all the public issues with Mtgox.   It was a risk, but there was no evidence to suggest they might lose every single bitcoin.   And there is no specific evidence to believe any of the other exchanges won't fall to the same fate (other than the assumption that most people are not totally incompetent charlatans)  
The whole point of this post is that without people taking those risks, bitcoin would be next to worthless.  Those of you arguing to the contrary are intellectually dishonest.

Rebuilding out their exchange on new equipment is certainly a complex project.   If they start it up and it falls over on the first day, they're going to catch a lot more flack than if they take their time.   Worse, if they lose any more coins they're probably done for.   
The theft is unfortunate, the waiting painful.   But as someone who's worked in IT infrastructure for going on 2 decades, I do not find the amount of time its taking to be a surprise at all.   As a customer I'd rather they take their time and do it right than to take risks in bringing it back up faster.
Could they have been amazing and had fully tested disaster recovery with dynamic provisioning?   Had a PR team on standby to field all the questions and sooth worried customers?    Certainly that would all be great, but then again could they be certain it was all secure without double checking everything after the hack?   Would having a PR team give you more frequent updates of "not yet" really make any difference?

Had MtGox been held to existing laws, they would not have been able to perpetrate the fraud that they did.   I made my own decisions with eyes open, to an extent.   But I had no reason to believe they were a complete fraud.   Again I'm not asking for a bailout.

Gemini has stated that they will follow the chain with the most work.   This means that if a majority fork occurs, they will upgrade to that chain.

Once BU HF happens, it would also pave the way for a cleaner HF implementation of the concepts in Segwit.    Being strongly in the blocksize increase / HF camp, my issues with Segwit are 100% about the false narrative regarding softfork safety, and with using the issue as a means to keep control of bitcoin's development.   HF Segwit makes for a cleaner implementation without the technical debt.
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:55:53
The false narrative is basically that a soft fork is "opt in".   The fact is, your node silently begins processing transactions that it does not understand.   Sure, you can keep running that node, but it is no longer helping to secure the network.   It's much safer to receive notice that the network has been upgraded and your node no longer can fully validate.   You then have the choice of upgrading, or not.   Really, in either case if you're of the minority view, you're drug along for the ride.   So better to do it affirmatively with a software upgrade (hard fork.)
Mike Hearn did a good job explaining and I share his viewpoint:
As for why -- The root of this is an intention to frame the narrative in such a way to drive people to the solution preferred by certain key parties (and now companies.)   They understand that on-chain scaling does not need to stop at 1mb.   But they fear (and have stated) that if it is shown to scale on-chain, it will set the expectation that on-chain scaling can go on forever.   They feel it is their right and duty to ensure that expectation is never established, so they can deliver the abstract solutions they (and their company) promote (by making them necessary.)
In order to achieve their goal, they needed to prevent on-chain scaling from happening before their solutions could be brought to bare.   To do this, they created a fear campaign against upgrading via a non-backward compatible manner, by terming it a "hard fork", calling it an "alt-coin."   They worked themselves into a corner on this, and now are no longer able to use the tool of a "hard fork" without going against the narrative.
Also employed to foster their goal is to promote the fear of bitcoin "centralization".     The problem is, bitcoin is already centralized, and has been for awhile.   Its not that centralization isn't bad, quite the contrary.   But the reality is, with ASIC dependent mining, that ship has already sailed.   So, I believe that fear is being thrown around under false pretense.      
The other is that malleability fixing and signature fee discounting are suddenly so important, when previously it was just a nuisance issue.   The reason is they are pre-requisites for LN / sidechains style solutions.   Those are super cool technologies, everybody should be excited about them existing.    Problem is, they're not here yet, they're super complicated, and most important, they still require sufficient blockspace to get in and out of the channel.   There really should be sufficient block space for everyone in a channel to exit safely, or it's like a packed concert in a nightclub with locked fire exits.    It should be OPTIONAL and based on market demand whether those solutions are used.
Further, every possible compromise was put forward over the past few years.   The side promoting segwit is intransigent and was unwilling to make even the smallest concession.   They've burned all the good will from those who disagree with their point of view.

Right so, as long as you only need to spend one output for this transaction, your rate could be what you say.   If you had received many small payments and needed to spend 3-4 outputs, you could easily be spending $1 in fees with current rates.   So your 5% estimate could sway as far as 20%.   For almost the entirety of Bitcoin's existence, such a payment was pennies, and not worth worrying about what the overhead is.   Even 5% is more than a credit card.  
And this comes with risks both to you and to the payment processor; either for them in accepting this transaction unconfirmed and risking losing to a double spend made easier by RBF polices and fee differential, or to you where you send a payment and its not accepted, and the merchant has to ask you to pay in cash, leaving your transaction in limbo, with need to follow up and request a refund.
I've been lucky to live somewhere that I could make such purchases regularly in Bitcoin.   Especially when attending meetups, it really helps sell the idea to normal people.   The recent exponential increase in fees puts this at risk.   So please think about how nice this experience was for you, and how tenuous the potential for lunch sized payments has become.

How does a segwit (or other softfork) unware node validate the new rules it doesn't understand?   Softfork is a hack to get old nodes to accept new rules that it isn't able to validate. 
Why do you have to be so dis-genuine in your arguments?     You could've worked out a moderate blocksize increase and accomplished all your goals with segwit a long time ago.    Why the intransigence?

Perhaps a new term can be coined for the situation with LN if you object to vaporware.   bait'n'switch-ware ?   Second layer scaling was sold as a way to scale without centralization, yet there is zero evidence that LN will be able to accomplish this goal.

LN's "success" outcome is one where people buy LN coins on an exchange, and then move those coins around without ever going on-chain.   In such a future, the limited blockspace will still become arbitrarily expensive.   If on-chain transactions cost $10, $100, or $1000, this effectively means on-chain is unusable for anyone other than for those LN hubs (banks &amp; exchanges) to settle.    The decision to rely on such schemes to scale BTC very intentionally subverted the large portion of the community who believed Bitcoin should scale on-chain.   This is a far more wide reaching impact than one payment processor adopting a payment protocol standard.   What Bitpay did is no different than Apple adopting standards like Firewire or Thunderbolt. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 01:35:03
BTC core development team and those who control the moderation of this sub are the "they" I would hold responsible.    And yes, force (in the form of coercion and disingenuousness) was used to drive BTC scaling off-chain. 
Bitpay's use of the payment protocol was their effort to keep BTC payments commercially viable.   Same as their adoption of BCH.   And this is the real reason OP is calling Bitpay anti-bitcoin.    Further, the payment protocol they used is not custom, but based on the BIP-70 standard.
@_date: 2018-06-05 01:36:10

Yes, I could have mentioned maybe displayport which they adopted early, but choose the others for their even closer association with Apple.  I take your point, BIP70 not being Bitpay-proprietary differs slightly from Apple's development of firewire, or their joint development with intel of thunderbolt.   My intention in using this as an analogy was not really focusing on who developed it but who choose to actually adopt it.    
That a leading company in the space made such a choice should be understood, not feared and hated.   The reason they did this is entirely because Bitcoin's utility was damaged badly by the decisions regarding the scaling strategy of the core team.   Those who fail to appreciate the value of the budding industry that has come up around this space and with such hubris fail to see how other tokens can and will supplant Bitcoin if it under-performs...its exasperating.   
LN is absolutely relevant to the Bitpay discussion.   The poster I replied to originally claimed 
"You are not doing anything wrong, Bitpay is an anti bitcoin company, and as such are forcing you to use a payment protocol that most wallets don't support. Ask the merchant to use another bitcoin gateway."
This person received 30 upvotes for saying that one of the companies who has done the most to foster Bitcoin adoption is anti-bitcoin.   Bitpay was EXTREMELY SLOW to adapt to the complete breakdown of the Bitcoin system in 2017, because they were among the more bitcoin maximalist companies out there.  What happened in 2017 has not been fixed, and any surge in use of Bitcoin WILL result in the same event.   Bitpay's payment protocol adoption was not about BCH, they obviously had it in the pipeline before BCH existed.  It was adopted to have some hope of dealing with the unsustainable small-block fee model.   They were adapting to the situation caused by small blocks.   They could have adopted LTC, ETH, DOGE, whatever the hell a long time ago and they did not do that.   I can't independently verify this but I've heard they are (and their actions reflect) large holders of BTC.   That they would adopt BCH in parallel is only further evidence of them having already been large BTC holders (as opposed to adopting ETH on day 1.)
I on the otherhand got -18.   Throughout the conversation I have avoiding using ad hominems, depite others succumbing to that desire.   But, you anti-Bitpay fuckers deserve to be called out for the looters that you are.   Trashing those who've done the most for Bitcoin by claiming they are anti-bitcoin is slanderous and unfactual.  Get your facts straight and do something constructive instead of bashing the people who are making this shit work.

Driving transactions off-chain is the strategy BTC has latched on to for the last couple of years.  The fact this happened while LN was still vaporware didn't stop it from driving BTC adoption into the ground.   Bitpay added a payment protocol in order to cope with the transaction fee fiasco created by the anti-blockchain crowd who've taken over the BTC project.   
So, yea, forcing people to use LN (which isn't even out of beta!) definitely seems more obscene than a company like Bitpay doing their best to adapt to the unsustainable situation with BTC and tx fees.

He's either a charlatan or a fool.    If he really received an oversized payout to keep quiet about his concerns of Mtgox embezzlement, he's very liable for civil litigation to reclaim the misappropriated assets.

Unless Mark sold or lost coins before the bubble(s), and was already effectively net short on coins before the run-up.   He had an explainable excuse (DHS confiscation) for not being able to remit fiat, but no excuse for not allowing coin withdrawal.   So in this theory he's forced to buy coins using the locked up customer fiat.   This compounds his problem by driving the price up more.    Until finally arbitrage through JPY accounts leaves him out of fiat, at which time (as indicated in the wizsec report) the bot starts selling.  The fact that they suddenly had a JPY withdrawal bottleneck at the beginning of 2014 supports this conclusion.   Finally he's out of coins and fiat, except for the 200k coins which would presumably have been what he hoped to keep for himself.   In this theory I suspect he felt the heat from all the media attention and reluctantly decided to cough up those coins.   
Obviously this is all conjecture but its really the simplest answer that supports the history.   Especially if he was short those coins due to a much earlier hack.  This would make his insistence that he was hacked true, and his sense of victimization justified (in his mind).

Bitcoin has an arbitrary limit of 1MB blocks.  This was added in the early days to prevent spam.    Several proposals have been made to increase this limit, however certain key members of the development effort are against it, despite it being a popular concept in the community at large.   To give the community a choice, BitcoinXT adopts one of the proposed increases, provided that a large portion (75%) of the hashing power of the network adopts the change.

Banks do have to coordinate inter-bank transfer of assets and currently use a variety of expensive proprietary solutions.    You could have multiple banks each mining an a bankchain which they all use for clearing transactions to each other.    Most databases have lots of single points of failure and are difficult to distribute.   Blockchain could simplify things a lot.
Where I see fault with this would be that they'll have to contribute significant hashing resources, or some rouge element could 51% attack them if they could get access to the network.    Of course, given that it would be a proprietary chain they could likely just agree to roll back the chain.

The core argument against increase is the theory that it will increase centralization.   Its all conjecture and no one really knows if it will have that impact.    What I think we can definitely see though is that there is too much centralization when it comes to who develops Bitcoin, and apparently who controls the conversation about it.
As far as the name, there are plenty of Bitcoin node implementations already.   Btcd/btcsuite, bitcoinj, Bitsofproof, others.   Bitcoin is a protocol....one we know as a specific network / instance of that protocol.   There's also the Bitcoin testnet for example, which is Bitcoin run on a different port.   The goal of XT is not to permanently fork the Bitcoin network, but to give an opportunity for the community to vote on the rules they want to govern the network.   
Hopefully if the consensus moves to XT and 8MB blocks, the core developers holding things up will relent and implement BIP 101.

People have given several kinds of indirect explanations to why your premise is mistaken.   The most direct way to put it is supply &amp; demand.    1 USD is not the same as 1 CAD, 1 AUD, 1 SGD, 1 GBP, 1 EUR ,1 CHF, 1 JPY...
Every..single...currency has a different floating rate (aside from a couple which peg themselves to another currency).   There are different variables at work, especially for these central bank controlled currency (how much they print, interest rates they dictate), but at the end of the day the value is based on supply &amp; demand.
With Bitcoin it has an extremely predictable supply.   A diminishing number of bitcoins are allocated over time until the total reaches 21 million.   So a controlled, asymptotic rate of inflation.   On the demand side, it is based on the utility of bitcoin, how desirable it is relative to other options people have, how easy it is for them to access, regulatory regimes, and so forth.   Bitcoin price relative to other currencies will be a product of this supply &amp; demand, and the convenience of exchange rate relative to some other currency like USD will not be a factor, at all.   You can't peg bitcoin price, as there is no central bank to dictate supply.

I think you have it backwards.  Bitcoins bought with real fiat, that was conveniently locked away by the DHS troubles.   Probably to make up for a shortfall in coins which had either been sold at too cheap a price (to fund lavish expenses), or perhaps stolen.   Arbitrage by people with Japanese bank accounts slowly sucked out the remaining fiat, until they started having trouble doing JPY withdrawals after new years.   Then bot ran in reverse, selling coins to get fiat (and the price falls).

The reason pools want smaller blocks is so that they have lower orphan rates due to large blocks not propagating.   The block reward is far larger than the tx fees, and thus they are currently incentivised to create small blocks (less transactions).
Smaller block size makes spam based DOS more effective, not less.   The larger the block, the more the spam costs.

Lukejr's activist position is at odds with the libertarian idealism  inherent in Bitcoin.

It is corrupt and authoritarian, subversive and manipulative.

Size and coin age are properties which can be determined from the transaction alone.   They are not discriminatory to anyone, all participants are treated alike.  Address reuse can only be enforced if the relay/miner has white/black lists, or is implementing address indexing.  It has no purpose aside from promoting a specific political agenda.  
All it would do is force those on-chain services to increase their fees.   As with the scorched earth concept needed to prevent doublespending by full-RBF, this just hands money to miners.  What's next?  How about we start forcing fees as a percentage of the transaction?     For that matter, what if miners decide they don't like a certain pool, gang up on them and orphan all of that pools blocks with a different sort of blacklist?   
So many ugly things that can happen if we normalize behavior which creates second class transactions or participants.   The same rules should apply regardless of WHO is sending or receiving.

In order to sell bitcoin, someone must buy it.   Turnover to more optimistic parties could be a good thing, if your opinion about bitcoiners' view is correct.  
Further, while many individuals may have purchased in the range you specify, I would suggest that the majority of bitcoins are NOT held by those people but by earlier adopters.   Those who did not sell when it went to $1200 last time are not going to sell at that price, ever.   
And last, while negativity on bitcoin will surely be higher when the price is down, the enthusiasm will kick in if prices rise.    If greed was their motivator, I see no reason to believe that will not be a motivator during another price run up.   They held through months of price down, even if they plan to cash out they'll want to see some profit.

My mom has become decent with day to day computing things.   And I think if I showed her exactly what to do she can handle Bitcoin as well, to a point.   But you're right in recognizing that the current status quo is dangerous for non-savvy users. 
I share your concern, with a somewhat different perspective.    One thing I've learned from various boom and bust cycles from many years working in the tech and finance industries...is the value of diversification.    My mom has no business putting her money in Bitcoin, simply because if Bitcoin becomes huge, she'll have plenty of benefit through me.   
Just tell your mom "I got this".
Further, even technically savvy people may be blind to some serious problems with Bitcoin itself.    While I work full time in the Bitcoin space, and completely believe in its potential,  many of us underestimate the weaknesses of the system.   Not technical weaknesses in the crypto, but the fact that the system relies on humans as much as any that has come before it.    Developers, miners, nodes, companies...these are made up of people.   Bitcoin works by consensus, math is only a building block.     There is plenty of opportunity for failure, not from external forces, but the most strident supporters themselves.   Good intentions don't insulate people from bad decisions.

Even uncontroversial updates to bitcoin core take a very long time to trickle out to all the nodes.   The conservative approach here is to take action as soon as possible so that we can have a nice long lead time for the change to take place.   
Unfortunately the needs of the community have been hijacked by a few pundits with a specific agenda.   They also happen to be the same people who are working on a (VC funded) "solution" to scale-ability.   One which quite arguably increase centralization dramatically. 
One other point that hasn't been made in your request for a ELI5:   miners ALWAYS have the ability to set soft limits.   Even if block size is totally uncapped (as in the original software written by Nakamoto), miners can (and do) set lower limits based on their own market driven incentives.   Having 2, 8, 20mb, or uncapped does not mean we're going to (routinely) see huge blocks.  The possibility of scaling to spikes in transactions is a very strong disincentive to spam.   Spam is cheap because their transactions often dont even get mined (thus free).   Without a cap, a miner could decide to temporarily remove their soft limit and sweep up the whole lot of spam in one go. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 06:32:08
Yes but the point is that if the network casually accepts full RBF, it becomes arbitrarily easy for wallets to doublespend at will.   And yes I fully understand that unconfirmed transactions are not in the blockchain, which is the entire basis for bitcoin security.   Doesn't change the fact that businesses can and do operate with a manageable risk relying on the current paradigm of most of the network being honest and rejecting doublespends.   RBF, without protective measures which it seems Peter Todd may very well end up supporting, is the most disruptive change imaginable to the current Bitcoin network.

@_date: 2015-08-30 04:42:05
The answer has always been obvious but most people are too afraid to accept it.
Miners already vote for themselves how large a block to make.   Why do we need bip101/0?   
It is good for the community if miners compete economically to make larger blocks.
Presently the pools have an incentive AGAINST including transactions in blocks.   **Its not centralization in mining they're trying to prevent, it's competition**
The answer, of course, is no limit.   A return to the original plan, before the temporary 1mb limit. 
A "technical" limit like 32mb is fine so long as it is understood what criteria will be used to raise the limit in the future.   This is no different than issues such as OS file-size, file-system size, hdd size, etc.  These things can be dealt with without heated debate.
Miner soft limits already exist.   They already decide how big a block to make.   They're only afraid that other people are going to out compete them with blocks having more utility (holding more transactions).

Considering we have pools mining 134kb blocks while there's a nearly 100k tx backlog, I don't see how this would make the problem any worse.
It is a much better solution also than implementing full RBF (as a way of allowing people to increase their fee) which has the result of suddenly making it trivial for any user at virtually no cost to simply reverse their unconfirmed transaction. 
When I first got involved heavily in bitcoin back in 2013 I made many mistakes with fee handling and would have enjoyed such a feature.   Certainly in the climate we have now where we may have continuous efforts to disrupt the network, this would be a welcome tool.

Thank you for posting this.    Its exactly right.    Unintended use cases can be the best kind =)  
There is NO RUSH to solve this non-problem.   Sure, if you want to educate people about the non-safety of 0-conf by all means do it.   There are far more important issues to tackle long before we change what we've come to expect from the network.
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:41:22
RBF isn't some panacea for miners that is going to be a huge economic boon to them.   It's being actively pushed by certain people in the dev community, and social pressure should be all it really takes.   If people are educated on what it means to them (no buying that beer, food, coffee, digital download without waiting an hour), I expect the vast majority of regular bitcoin users would protest strongly.

@_date: 2015-07-20 03:46:41
There are many successful businesses which can mitigate the risk down to a small acceptable loss.    I really wonder whether the people arguing for RBF actually USE bitcoin in their daily life.   It requires sufficient planning and technical know-how to discourage someone from double spending the pizza or beer, or even the bitcoins they sold to someone they just met.   But add an "undo" button to a wallet and the number of unethical people who will double spend grows dramatically.
@_date: 2015-07-09 00:58:11
I would add also that this could be used by the recipient of the transaction not just the sender (as RBF would).    CPFP is not widely implemented.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:40:24
Upvoted for being reasonable response.   
Only thing I would add is that I fully expect mining to ultimately be a non-profit endeavor - that is, part of large (profitable) businesses infrastructure spend.   Assuming Bitcoin is still going, which is a huge if.   More likely some USA sanctioned corporate facebook crypto takes over.   Enabling the unbanked to have an equal footing at the cost of US hegemony will be resisted with the full force of American imperialism. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 08:58:44
You shouldn't buy bitcoins from a stranger (and walk away) unconfirmed.   The new additions (RBF) to the latest bitcoin core make it trivial for someone to doublespend you.

My point is that having separate projects which proceed to deploy their own changes is NORMAL and HEALTHY.   Pick any open source tech and you'll find this kind of thing.   This keeps things in check.
What's really lacking is a proper standards body.   A W3C type organization, with constituents participating from all Bitcoin interests.

I've wanted this for awhile, my only concern / suggestion is that it should have a policy of not promoting double spending.    While many of our pedantic friends will insist 0-conf tx's should not be relied upon, we should make every effort to discourage making them any less secure than they already are.

@_date: 2015-07-19 11:22:43
As much as we all like to profess otherwise, Bitcoin (the network anyway) is not based on math, it's based on consensus.    A majority of "honest" miners.    The purpose of POW is to make transactions more and more secure, as they get deeper into the blockchain.   No one is saying unconfirmed transactions are secure.   But why would you not operate on the basis that we do not go out of our way to make them LESS secure?    
The RBF debate ignores the ecosystem which, for better or for worse, has grown up around the gap in the Bitcoin system, for instant transactions.    The better solutions to this are not yet available and certainly not in wide use.   No one is saying we should not progress with payment channels and other mechanisms.    But you need to deal with the reality on the ground, which is that right now a whole lot of the usability of Bitcoin is enabled by payment processors and others ability to make a service with a small acceptable risk. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 08:57:32
If transactions pay the proper competitive fee that everyone else is paying, the transaction should be treated as any other as a matter of best practice.   Efforts to try and decide which traffic is desired and which isn't is a very obvious slippery slope towards censorship.   Network attacks cannot be stopped if the people are willing to pay the fee.   The only way to combat them is to increase the potential transaction volume so that it is prohibitively expensive.  
What if we start adding hooks to talk to chain analysis APIs, KYC processors, etc before agreeing to relay (or mine) a transaction?   Is this possible, yes of course.  Bitcoin is not based on math, it is based on consensus.  A network founded on the concept that money should flow uninhibited between willing parties.  While these things may be inevitable, there is no reason that we should not resist censorship at every turn.
Regarding whether on-chain gambling (or other services) are a good or bad idea, that can be debated elsewhere and really shouldn't be the matter of discussion in any kind of bitcoin core development or mining policy context.   As a note, the reason these services are popular is because they offer a level of transparency and proof of honesty and solvency only currently practical in Bitcoin (and other cryptos).  Suggesting vaporware as a solution isn't a real answer.   Surely as other side/tree-chain, lightening-whatever networks come into existence and become useful, those services will move to use them.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:38:09
The purpose of Bitcoin mining is supposed to be to enable people to use the Bitcoin network right?   So, on one end of the spectrum you have really high fees and few transactions.   On the other you have many many transactions and small fees.   Which would you say is more aligned with the philosophy behind Bitcoin?   Which is more likely to gain global adoption and much benefit for the developing world?    
As for long term when fees dominate block rewards, that's going to be quite awhile given the current blocksize limit.   Currently to equalize, you'd need 0.0244 fee per 1KB.  After 8 halvings, or 29 years from now, you get down below the current 0.0001/KB. 
Mining takes a lot of investment.   The long-term health of Bitcoin is very much in miners' self interest.    Acting for only short profit, miners could do any number of bad things.   For example they could require transactions with large values to include a bigger fee.   But they don't, simply because its obvious to them this kind of thing is self destructive.   Absent activist developers pushing for this upending of the standards that govern the network, you are not going to get a significant number of miners doing this kind of thing.   This meme of inevitability that is circulating is totally baseless.
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:31:19
The more hashing power implementing RBF the more risk 0-conf processors have to take, no doubt.    But I disagree completely with the conclusion that it is inevitable, and more so with the idea that inevitability means we should hasten this outcome. 
I could argue that it's inevitable that large companies ultimately take over Bitcoin mining, and that governments use their influence to control what transactions get mined.   Does this mean we should not do all we can to resist it?

It's up to each participant, and their own need for secrecy.   I'm never against education.   Truth should be the most highly prized goal of any human in our society.   But forcing people to act in the way you think is best is what we're fighting against, implicitly, by supporting Bitcoin.   Seeing this kind of authoritarianism within the Bitcoin dev community is the first time in the 4 years I've followed this project that I felt truly negative and sad about my involvement.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:14:36
Yes.   If the transactions pay the right fees (chained or not) they should have the same treatment as any other transactions with those fees.   If a person is willing to spend money to fill the limited block size, they'll be able to do it with or without this.

If you publish a static donation address for a long time, it'll get cached in a lot of places and could get donated to even after you thought you were done with the address (had changed it on the current donation site).   Some future person donating to your 'old' address after quantum cryptography has made it unsafe to spend twice even with a proper RNG, *might* conceivably cause you to lose your donations.
So basically, a convoluted set of future events.   For all intents and purposes, presuming your RNG is not broken, you can get away with address reuse just  fine.   Its not best practice by any means.    But its a matter of risk / reward whether simplicity trumps best practice.

I don't think OP is advocating for censoring Blockchain articles.

The transaction is not confirmed.
It's nested under two unconfirmed transactions.   
The last tx this chain depends on that confirmed was :
You can see the outputs were both spent, 
The one that went to 1F3BiJs97zpn6HgEPMbvKN3pFbYQkGcz3J is identical to the one above that starts 4a4d.    This was transaction malleability.   Everything that was based on the other instance of the malleated transaction was nullified after it's unconfirmed dependency disappeared.
While blockchain.info has some bugs in their wallet which have dealt poorly with malleability, this is not their fault.    Until the new updates released with core 0.11.1 are adopted by all the miners you'll continue to have problems here.  How gracefully each wallet/service/blockexplorer deals with this is a secondary issue.

I'd add to cqm's advice that even if you choose not to sell now given the short vs long cap gains,  you may still wish to do it in the future and given the sordid history at most bitcoin exchanges, I recommend you obtain the actual documentation of your cost basis now if possible, if you haven't already.    Will come in handy later even if you decide to sell at a profit and don't want to be on the hook for paying cap gains on the entire sale price.    
I do think your 1 year time frame is likely a bit optimistic on profit though, given your entry point.   If bitcoin sees that kind of momentum again, I hope you'll consider at least staying in part of your position for the long haul.  Making money on an investment is a nice feeling, but even better to be part of a historic movement!
