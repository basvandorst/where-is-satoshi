My advice to anyone out there wanting to be financially secure is to never have children. Not only do you save a lot of money without any effort but you also create one less slave in the world.
I personally became financially secure when learned about r/antinatalism, refused to breed, minimized debt, and lived a minimalist lifestyle.

If this happens with fiat, can the money be recovered? Suppose you hold a lot of money in shares and someone forces you to log into your online broking account and sell it and then transfer the money to them.

Many places accept it, and you can easily convert to USD if you need to.

No problems. For anyone reading I suggest r/antinatalism and r/vhemt and r/childfree and any books by David Benatar. If we talk honestly and earnestly with others we can spread the idea and have a huge impact on the world. Not only is a birthstrike a very selfless and noble act that helps the planet and the environment but it also has monetary benefits, giving you financial security and wealth and freedom. Being childfree is both selfish and selfless at the same time.

Maybe, but the number of times he or she emphasises that he wasn't emotionally or financially affected by the scam (eg not affected emotionally by praising the scammer, and not affected financially by saying that he is not broke and doesn't need the money, etc) looks like he is overcompensating.

What do you think is the solution? Would a birthstrike help? What if we all went antinatalist?

The world would be a much better place with more socialism. Right now there is too much capitalism. I believe there needs to be a good balance between the two. It's not a case or one or the other.

This all happened before when bitcoin crashed from $1000 to $200 and before that it crashed from $30 to $2. Mark my words. Bitcoin will go sideways for about three or four more years and then shoot to $100k. If you think I'm wrong then short me while I go long.

Perhaps you have too much in crypto. Adjust your allocation accordingly.

I think tech stocks are great but right now they are expensive. The best time to buy is when blood is on the streets so I'd hodl the tech stocks and buy the crypto.

Unless you keep it in bitcoin for investment. If I get paid in bitcoin (e.g. if someone splits the cost of lunch with me) then I keep it and HODL it. If I need to spend, just use your existing fiat. In the future, I believe bitcoin will be accepted almost everywhere. It already is accepted in many places.

I am semi-retired in my thirties. The key is in never having children.
Otherwise the advice to buy stocks, bonds and crypto is solid. But you need money to buy these assets. How much money you invest depends on avoiding huge expenses.

What's going on? Why is this a scam? 
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:09:22
There are no strings attached to dating, friends and hobby. You can do these and stop at any time if you realize your expenses are growing too much. A child is different. Once you have one you are legally obligated to pay for it until it is 18, and Time Magazine has stated that the overall cost of a child raised from birth through to college and including opportunity costs is about $1 million in lifetime earnings lost, so it is not a small amount of money.
I know it is unpopular to be antinatalist, and I personally do desire a child of my own, but I suppress any desire for children because I cannot deny the inherent oppressive, evil and depraved nature of humanity. It is immoral to have children. We should all do what we can to curb the growth of humanity.

I'd prefer her to Trump. Trump being president is the strongest argument why we should all stop breeding to prevent innocent children being subject to a hostile world. Antinatalism is the only solution.

I get paid in fiat and then convert fiat into crypto for investment. When I buy goods I use fiat. However, when my crypto goes up in value a lot, it is cheaper to spend the crypto rather than convert it to fiat then spend the fiat. Businesses will also find it profitable accepting crypto because of low fees compared to credit card and cash handling fees. So as crypto prices go up, more and more businesses will accept it and more people will use it as currency.

Hold on to it for the long run. Many people borrow money to buy property, and it may take decades before you earn good money because 7% growth is considered good. Yet when you borrow to invest in bitcoin with 600% growth, suddenly it's a dumb investment. People say this because they don't understand. They are not used to it. They invest based on familiarity and imagery rather than logic. But the same argument they use to get a mortgage can be used for bitcoin. Simply hold onto the bitcoin when it goes down. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:28:08
It's all about how much volatility you're willing to tolerate. The lowest volatility investment is cash but that has little returns. Then you move up the volatility scale to property then to shares then to crypto. The more risk you take, historically the more returns you get based on historical prices. If you borrow to invest, you can magnify your returns through increasing volatility even more. It is a personal thing and depends on how much risk one is willing to take.

1) Not everyone accept one currency. There are multiple currencies in the world. For example if I had USD and I went to Indonesia I wouldn't be able to use it. I would need to convert it to IDR just as I would need to convert BTC to IDR.
2) Bitcoin is a store of value. Why would it now be worth $9k if it were not?
3) Bitcoin is volatile when price in USD but USD is volatile when priced in bitcoin. That being said, bitcoin is volatile relative to common items people buy, but that is because most items are priced in fiat currency. In the future many items I imagine will be priced in crypto so crypto is now an investment that will perform well if it is used a lot in the future. It will be used a lot in the future because if distrust in suppliers if fiat currency, which by definition relies on faith whereas crypto is trustless.

Going into debt to buy bitcoin is smart. For example, credit card interest rate is 20% but bitcoin has gone up 600% on the last year. People justify going into debt to buy property, so why not leverage into Bitcoin?

That's not true. You invest in crypto first. After a massive windfall when you become a millionaire and you retire, you spend your crypto. If crypto goes up a lot in the future as those who invest in it are predicting, many businesses will accept it. When you invest you do so based not on what happens today but what you predict will happen in the future.

Borrowing money to start a business and borrowing money to buy bitcoin are actually very similar. Bitcoin can be seen as a business.

Bitcoin's value comes from its ability to be used as currency. It has the properties of money e.g. fungibility, store of value, etc. Why not just use fiat cash? Because you cannot trust the issuer of that fiat currency to simply print more for themselves or their friends. Bitcoin's protocol ensures this does not happen and caps supply at 21 million.

Odds are against you? Bitcoin has been going up since its inception. The odds are for you if odds are based on history. Historical prices are used to justify just about all investment eg shares in retirement accounts or property.
