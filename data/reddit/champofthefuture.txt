What's more inexcusable than not knowing bitfinex and not taking the time to google it, is publishing this story now (that the price of BTC is recovering) when the research paper is more than a year old and resulted in a federal investigation on bitfinex, about a year ago 
This is manipulation of information to serve his anti-bitcoin agenda (which is not even his but that of the banks and other advertisers he indirectly work for). 
Yeah mainstream media columnist are cretins who's role is to defend the establishment. I can also tell you about Thomas Friedman of the New York Times in terms of foreign policy but why waste time on overweight establishment boomers. You're not going to learn anything new, true, nor interesting from them. It's simply not their role.

Kitsch as fuck

You have the most valuable of all assets, time and not much to lose. So a few 30-something-years old boomers will be jealous (I am one, fuck you OP), but it can pay off bigly in the end. And it won't necessarily be all white or all black two years from now. Bitcoin will most likely just be a few percent higher or lower than its current value. And you will have time to cash out during those two years, assuming you manage to get access to an internet connection.

Some cryptocurrencies die or become valueless, e.g. DAO. It can happen. 
In fact, Bitcoin completely losing value would be less of disruption than it hitting 1million. The latter would most likely lead to the collapse of the USD and large portions of the global economy, hundreds of thousands of death. There will be a shutdown of the internet long before it happens (not your submarine cables, not your bitcoin). There have been world wars foe much less than this. Won't happen.

Humans will always need shelter and homes will remain a good investment, because there is only so much habitable land. 
Whether it'll be a better or worse investment than bitcoin is another question, and one that no one has the answer to. Don't understand why it has to be one or the other though. Why put all your eggs in one basket? You can continue holding half your bitcoin and buy half a building or a smaller building.

If you're in bangkok, there's a BTC ATM in Rama 9

I don't like to talk with people who comment on links they haven't opened. If you did, you'd see the opposite of what you're saying stated in the link you are commenting on (i.e. that the federal investigation resulted from that Journal of Finance paper, a peer-reviewed journal article btw, not merely a report).
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:12:50
We will most likely never hear about them. There are already many bitcoin billionnaires (a lot of which are drug dealers and hitmen who were forced to use bitcoin on the dark web since 2010).
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:26:24
If you're into trading, better learn about altcoins my man. Bitcoin is not really the best instrument for that. It's more of an investment asset.

This is extremely cool but the "only" part is also a bit scary. There should be some sort of label for apps in the crypto community. Something you would immediately see when visiting the website of a crypto app, like the little lock for SSH encryption, with criteria such as 'keeps data on device', 'gives you control over your private keys', etc. .
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:48:13
Good stuff. Perhaps you could add a beginner-friendly glossary of terms, such as market cap, volume, etc.
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:05:37
Imagine the crappy feeling I get when I think that I made a note to myself on my desktop in 2010-2011 to buy 100€ bitcoin (in order to buy...things from the dark web). Still have the note to self but didn't follow through. And then went through some real bad financial hardships in 2014 where the bitcoin could have literally avoided me homelessness. Now it's all good and I have bought bitcoin in 2017. What's really crazy is that it is still growing, with even more room to grow and even investing now is most likely a good idea.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:11:01
The paper has been reviewed and accepted by the journal of finance (the top journal in the field with an uber-selective acceptance rate). “Is Bitcoin Really Un-Tethered?” 
Of course Bitfinex is going to refute it.
PS. Personally, I find the claim that a single player can influence the price of bitcoin that much a little hard to believe (what about the exponential increases in the price, before tether?) and as is common, their conclusions are being misrepresented by journalist pursuing an anti-bitcoin agenda. But the journal of finance is solid. So I hold no conclusive opinion either way.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:49:44
Makes sense
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:58:42
No, let's be factual. No one is buying and selling things using bitcoin. Most bitcoin owners bought it hoping thatbit will go up in value and for them make a profit, which may or may not happen.

How does that frequency compare to that of the credit card payments you make/receive on the internet?
I wish it were otherwise, but it's still far from being the currency of the internet. I hope and believe we will get there some day and have put a significant amount of my savings where my mouth is. 
PS. "No one" is obviously not meant literally. Sorry for the misleading use of "factual" but let's not nitpick please. 
That being said confirmation bias is the enemy and we have to fight it hard in ourselves.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:48:52


Alright. I stand corrected.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:49:28
Just saw that it went up again. And that was my first thought lol
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:51:14
The currency of the internet is fiat paid throught credit cards/paypal and bitcoin has a long way to get there is what I am saying.

*clenches hodl muscles*
Curious why do you think it will go even lower?
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:45:13
Crazy inscrutable little shit. Even if it's worth zero some day, the ride was worth the while fuck it.

From the sound of it, you have great work ethics and family values. These things are priceless. They're what will make you win long term and put the right opportunities on your path. As for the short term, win some lose some and learn from your mistakes.

Good advice. Thank you!

It's obviously superior in every possible aspect (decentralization, limited supply by design, digital nativeness). Fiat rightfully looks like an obsolete boomer legacy shit. 
But we're not there yet and there will be massive resistance. Pretending that the battle is already won is no way to win it. It's actually counterproductive.

Or more dead or convicted drug dealers that operated on the darkweb. It was their de facto currency for years before most of us heard of Bitcoin.

It would be hilarious that there is such a simple model of how to become a millionaire IRL, in plain sight on twitter and it turns out to be correct (and save for major catastrophes there's no reason for it not to imo. It's been correct over the last 10 years).
We'll get a serious clue with the next halving.

Why are you talking like some financial guru being interviewed on TV 'I have been saying this for years' lol. Your unsubstantiated opinion is duly noted, Sir. Now, off you fuck.

It's about that in Spain too, but there's no standard really. It's still the wild west out there. One was at 25%, the other at 10%.

Calling a token you are offering "an enormous hidden opportunity" is not very ethical, man.

No one ever claimed that it applies to all tradable commodities, let alone paintings lol

What do you think are realistic best and worst case scenarios for Bitcoin, by 2021? (Value, adoption, use cases, effect on fiat, anything relevant).
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:12:20
Awesome! Will check it out in detail.
Yeah that was my very first remark to PlanB. It only works for intermediate/long term investing and tbf he clearly stated that it's only use is for investing, not trading. I was precisely looking for something like what you have posted.
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:55:13
Just learn about how to put it somewhere safe and forget about it for a few years then
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:37:11
I was aware of the podcasts. Will try to find the medium analysis. Sounds interesting. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:19:48
Nothing much there, except this 6 comments thread asking a theoretical question, not discussing the model itself 
@_date: 2019-09-16 10:51:51
Yeah nothing technical about it, it's just entertainment.
It's self-referential too. A guy does TA because he is credible and his credibility is endowed by the fact that he is doing TA. 
Learn the basics of bitcoin and money (Saifedean's book is enough) to know that there are at least valid reasons to be bullish. The rest, no one knows.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:38:06
Great insights. He does have a model with the price as just a function of time and it seems to perform just as well as the more complex stock to flow model 
For error measurement and charts (and in his whole code of github) he seems to consider discrete data points for price. I don't think there is any malice in it, must be the only data set he had access too. Will point him towards your error measurement method.
