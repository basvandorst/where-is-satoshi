No let's be real here back of granola packet duh
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:12:33
That's what I'm hoping also.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:28:42
Thank you for the advice! I will look into that right now.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:45:05
We will see, only time will tell.

I'm watching it to, this is getting crazy.
To bad my BTC won't be here until Wednesday.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:47:51
If that's the case why will it take 7 days to receive my BTC? If it's a loan shouldn't the BTC already be in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:01:36
How can I do crypto transactions, because tbh I have no idea what that means or what it is lol
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:59:32
Okay so what I'm understanding is that the BTC has already been purchased and is in my wallet. It is just currently on standby and unusable until they can verify the funds Will go through.
Thanks! Guess I will just have wait and see if the ETF goes through and decide to Hold or sell on Wednesday then.

Not for long
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:43:33
Is it common for most people who use Bitcoin to have to wait a week for their BTC to be deposited?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:09:31
I am so lost with this. What is everyone talking about with these new currencies?
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:00:27
Wait what split huh??
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:42:11
I hope all you laughers are right, but I think the price is going to be on the decline for at least a while. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:38:30
I think hitting these kinds of highs were just because of the speculation on the ruling to be honest.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:39:45
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:40:41
When my price was $1,166 I honest can't foresee it climbing back up again anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-03-09 03:41:13
Canceled why?
