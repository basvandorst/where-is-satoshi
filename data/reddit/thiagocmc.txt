I'll use this money to rebuild the Wardenclyffe Tower to send wireless electricity to the entire world!
Lets finish what Nikola Tesla started more than 100 years ago!!
Also, I'll start the first experimental city of The Venus Project, based on wireless electricity!
I'll also donate part of this money to  and I'll plan to adopt a child from a war zone soon as I can.

They found a way to mine more efficiently, this is NOT wrong.
They are not breaking the Bitcoin protocol standards.
They are producing valid blocks.
Nothing to see here.
If someone thinks that I’m wrong in my opinion, please, say it!
From what I’m seeing, they are just more efficient than anybody else and people are jealous about that. So, boost your AISC too!
If BU and its FlexTransactions, EC, and etc, works with ASICBOOST, so be it!
Personally, I don't like BU's Emergent Consensus. But, I also don't like SegWit as a soft-fork.
Looks like that BU have something similar with SegWit, its FlexTransactions, that is simpler and can support things like lightning networks as well, and a fix for transaction malleability, alongside with way bigger blocks!
BU without human involvement in EC would be GREAT for Bitcoin! Don't you guys think?

Mercado Bitcoin (a.k.a Leandro César Marciano), still owes me ~2.500,00 Bitcoins.
I'm asking about my money since March.
Don't trust this guys, they are scammers.
Editora Abril is one of the worse companies in Brazil. SuperInteressante is pure crap.

Rodrigo, where are my 2500.00 Bitcoins ??? I'm asking about my money since March... You are kidding, right?!
You have my money and I'll do everything I can, on this life, to get it back.
You guys have said on a lecture at USP, that I am a legend, right?! Okay, okay... We'll see. I'm a legend that will not let you live, if you not return my money ASAP.

Guess what?! Brazil have about 185 millions of idiots.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:38:01
They claim they have around 1,471.75  BTC / month of volume, this is HUGE for Brazil. And lots of times, price drops too much here, on MB... People throwing money away?! Don't think so...
I'm seeing that, in less than two months, Mercado Bitcoin sold all my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:02:00
Yes, I am.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:36:40
You know, right?! No Bitcoin was stolen.

Yes, Leandro (Mercado Bitcoin) still owes me around 2500 Bitcoins. They are scammers.

Thanks!  =)
I was working with "Mercado Bitcoin / Leandro / Bitcoin Rain" for more than a year... I researched a lot but, yes, my mistake to move my Bitcoins, to a wallet that wasn't mine, lesson learned the hard, very hard way.
Anyway, I trust MtGox, BTC-e, Bitstamp, ZipZap... I'm a trader... It is not very hard to imagine money flowing from here to there... I'm saying this because, well, in the end of the day, we need to trust each other... Don't you think!? For example, others drivers, health care, etc...
Yes, I bought when it was cheaper but, well, not that cheap.
When the prices raised a bit, I requested a (~1,300.00 Bitcoins) withdraw (23 and 26 March) and, couple days later, Leandro announced its scam here:  
The point is, Mercado Bitcoin is playing with my family's money, they knows that. So, I'll do everything I can, during my lifetime, to get my money back. Mercado Bitcoin have two options, give my money back, or give my money back.
There is no way in hell that Mercado Bitcoin have so much liquidity, after "losing" so many Bitcoins... Where those Bitcoins come from?! You know that it is easy to follow. Right?!    =)

He is ignoring me. I mean, he answers my e-mails but, I don't want words, I need my money back.
Believe me, I'm doing everything I can to receive my money back peacefully (I talked a lot with him, but not anymore, I lost my patience), since March, in Reals, in Bitcoins or Litecoins, in goods like cars, bikes, apartments, anything that have a good value and liquidity, I accept... But guess what?! Nothing.
