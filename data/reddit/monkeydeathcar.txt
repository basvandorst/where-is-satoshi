Am I the only one capable of seeing that the volatility is due to the low number of people holding BTC? I mean, concentrate all dollars into the same number of hands and the dollar will be just as volatile. It's a "problem" that sorts itself out as adoption grows. As simple as that.

I'm not worried about any of my Bitcoins because they've already said that bitcoin holdings aren't subject to reporting. They don't care about anybody's BTC. What is subject to reporting is any fiat in the same exchange. So if you had more than ten grand in Gox, or if you had less than ten grand but your other foreign holdings, plus whatever you had in Gox, total more than ten grand, then guess what? They will have grounds to prosecute and/or fine and/or imprison you if you don't include it in your FBAR. Everybody has to pull their heads out of the sand. It's not an acceptable defense.

I think it will be 1.3k for three days in April, then slide to 500 for the following six weeks, then rocket to 6.8k in June. Unfortunately, in early July one of Coinbase's founders gets caught with a dead hooker in his trunk and the price goes to five dollars each. Then 38k just before Christmas.

One: If you've received a lot of money specifically for investing, I'd recommend against putting all of it in any one thing. 
Two: Bitcoin is still something of a gamble at this stage. I wouldn't consider it a sound investment. "Invest" only as much as you'd feel comfortable "investing" at a casino in Las Vegas.
Three: If you do want to purchase coins and store them securely, I'd recommend Bitcoin Armory and a PC that never has, and never will touch the internet (except for maybe initial OS install). Fill the network adapter with hot glue or disconnect it from the mobo or something.
Google "Bitcoin Armory" for more details.

Worst: against all natural law, people start seeing collisions in wallet addresses. People make new wallets to find money already in them. It is discovered that the algorithm used to create new addresses only uses a portion of the huge range of possible addresses and we've begun to overwrite well before the heat death of the universe as a result. Unlikely.
Best: Banks and other financial institutions scrap their current money transfer systems in favor of the cheaper blockchain and there is a land grab for as many BTC as each bank can buy in a very short amount of time. These coins go into use immediately and become the predominant institutional system of asset transfer worldwide.

Bitcoin needs an application layer on top to take care of security and whatever, just like HTTP needs an application layer on top (the browser) so that we don't have to worry about skimming through raw code. That need, however, does not make the protocol any less useful or valuable.
Now, what that layer will look like is at this point anyone's guess, but that doesn't mean it will never happen either.

And think about when you were a teenager.

Now image if you were hanging out in your friend's room, opened a closet, and he said, "Oh yeah. That's my child porn collection."
OK, I'm going to be charitable and say that OK, maybe you wouldn't go looking for a new place IMMEDIATELY. But compare that to Pierce's reaction, which was, "Getting a villa in Spain together is a rational next step."

No, but it is easy to get caught up in the excitement if you don't understand how these things work. And especially if you come from a background that holds money dear, as this kid seems to. The well-off don't have an emotional connection to money; it means less to them. And it's VERY hard to make smart choices with your money if you're too emotional about it.

How does mine sound? I just created an encrypted volume with TrueCrypt and moved a copy of the wallet.dat file into there (with the client off, of course). Then I deleted the original wallet. Then, when I want to use the client again, I open the volume and replace the wallet and put the now outdated encrypted wallet into a folder with today's date. Then when I'm finished, I move the wallet back into the encrypted volume root. Can I improve this? Are there holes?

I'll give you my story as an example (and cautionary tale for anyone else): I didn't know that bitcoin was a bad idea; I just saw people getting rich and I thought this was how people got rich. It might have worked too (to a small degree) except that it took so long to get money into Mt Gox. I wanted to buy when it was at ten, but I couldn't get any money in until it was already at 28. By that time, I had spent a week reading people's comments of elation and shouting, "Hurry up, hurry up" in my head all day long. I was WAY too emotionally invested before I put in a single cent. So when the drop hit IMMEDIATELY AFTER, I couldn't believe it. I actually bought some more on the way down because I was convinced (couldn't tell the difference between conviction and hope at that point) it would come back up. I didn't panic until it hit ten again. Then I realized what I'd done and decided to cut my losses. Then it shot back up to 25. If I had just been able to detach myself from the big dreams of FINALLY having enough money and not having to worry about it for once in my life, I might have been cooler about it and I might have stepped away from the PC, taken a deep breath, and waited to see what happened the next day. But I didn't. I made a small profit on the second uptick, and ended up only losing half, not 70%, but I still would have walked away with only a 20% loss if I hadn't been all like, "OMG OMG OMG I need to get out before I lose everything Jesus save me."
I don't know if this answers your question, but money is something I'm used to seeing other people with, not me. I grew up hearing my parents fight over it every night. It triggers a lot of anxiety. So I do tend to make judgments based on emotion more than intelligence with it. I'm learning, but not as quickly as some others, I guess.

You misunderstand what a "psycho" is. Psychopaths come in two types: the manipulative domination-seeking type, and the unable-to-exercise-impulse-control type. The first type would refrain from selling poisoned drugs, despite his lack of empathy, because doing so would result in no profit and even if he wanted to see someone die, he wouldn't be able to because of the nature of mail-order sales. The second type kills due to a lack of executive function, usually in the heat of the moment, and if they chose to kill someone, they wouldn't do it by going through the trouble of establishing a trusted seller rating on Silk Road or whatever. They'd just grab a claw hammer and ring their target's doorbell.

Ok. So the way I see it now, my read-only wallet should generate the change address and receive the change, then, right? I can just continue creating unsigned transactions without having to update anything on the offline machine? And this doesn't make the wallet less secure, having spent a portion of it? I'm sorry if my questions get annoying, I just REALLY want to make sure I'm as secure as possible and rule out any nasty surprises.

Two things:
1. at the moment, bitcoin is viewed as a rapidly-appreciating currency, making it more attractive to merchants. Thus the perceived value is actually greater. Merchant hesitation is not universal; in fact, it is declining now.
2. It hasn't entered the "mature currency" phase yet. We're still in the adoption phase. You see how it works? First, simply owning the currency makes you wealthier. Lots of people buy and hoard it. Then, after this bubble has calmed down, people decide the price isn't going anywhere, and they have all this bitcoin lying around doing nothing, so they start using it. When everyone has adopted it and it has reached near-saturation, the bubbles stop. THEN it becomes a mature currency.
You don't get it because you are operating out of a flawed thesis to begin with. You think that your assessment of the situation, which is (mostly) correct, is an argument AGAINST bitcoin when it is actually a rather strong argument FOR it.

OK. I'm thinking laminated printout at the moment. Safe from water. Fire is another problem, I suppose. I'd have to have a copy in a fire-resistant safe I guess.

You can start here:
The main things to remember:
Your private keys must be made on a machine that never sees the internet. Ever. This can be a virtual machine as long as it runs off a DVD or CD, not the hard drive. Disconnect hard drives and all network connections before booting into it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:12:18
Don't do anything until you have talked with an accountant, and perhaps a tax specialist.
Don't make money decisions when you are emotional. Cashing out entirely might sound tempting, but you'd be better off cashing out just a little bit at a time, if for no other reason than not getting whacked with a huge tax bill all at once.
Also, charity is a great thing, but with all this free time, you may have better chances to distribute this money yourself. Charities can take a HUGE cut of your donation as overhead - more may get to the people who need it if you send it yourself.
Actually, if you're sitting on 2 mil, you're in a decent position to just start your own charity and run it yourself. I know that's something I'd love to be able to do.

So what you are saying here is that I don't actually need a wallet.dat file at all; all I need to spend coins is the public/private key pair, and these can be written down/printed on paper or something. So I don't have to encrypt and save the wallet.dat file?

OK. Figuratively, I'm with you. For all intents and purposes, you can send to wallets that aren't connected. But you can't REALLY send coins into a wallet that isn't connected to the net, like, you can SEND them AT the wallet, but the wallet won't have any coins in it until you connect it to the network, and you can't spend coins out of that wallet, because the wallet has to be connected to know that it has "received" coins. Correct?
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:31:51

@_date: 2013-11-28 04:57:56

@_date: 2013-11-19 09:21:45
It doesn't. In fact, I'd argue that BTC isn't a mature, robust currency just yet. Still has some issues regarding ease of use, theft, etc. But the mania phase we're in doubles as a kind of advertising campaign (really, there is no better advertising than people becoming millionaires overnight) that gets people into it.
Once we reach an even distribution of bitcoin, a closer-to-universal adoption, and a system of consumers and merchants that will deal in it, then we will have a viable currency.
TL;DR: It isn't a viable currency yet. We are watching it become one, in real time.

Did you create your wallet on a computer that was connected to the internet - ever or in the future?
If so, your coins are vulnerable. Even if you have never had problems with viruses before, someone could have found a way to get a quiet, invisible virus onto your computer that scans for anything that looks like a private key and sends it to the virus writer, who can then do whatever they want with whatever is in your wallet.
If you want to backup your wallet long term, there is already a more or less accepted way to do this. It's called cold storage. Armory does this well, but you have to be willing to get your hands dirty inside your PC or else buy another PC that will never, ever touch the internet.
You can do it without Armory, but that is a bit involved as well.
I use Armory to create offline wallets on a PC that has no connection to the internet and no connected hard drives, and I don't use the same PRINTER on the offline PC and the online PC (just in case something remains in the cache after printing out my paper backup), and I STILL worry about waking up one day and finding my coins gone.
TL;DR: No, you are not doing it right. You MAY be safe. You MAY not. It's a total coin toss. You won't know until the coins disappear, and by then it will be too late.
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:58:19

Actually, the instability is promoting adoption, and doing that job quite well. Slow, steady growth in usage among a hardcore group of enthusiast-nerds would not have gotten Bitcoin into the news anywhere near as quickly as the wild, sexy swings of a runaway market have.

OK, got it.
Two USB keys, or, actually, I was going to burn to CD as well, since (I think) optical media is slightly safer regarding data loss than USB stick. I could be wrong though. So one USB stick for public keys only, two CD backups of private keys, and a paper backup, printed via USB, not ethernet.
I can destroy my offline OS after using it (I'll be booting off a LiveCD and my hard drive and internet connections will all be disconnected), and then boot into a new LiveCD instance, reinstall Armory and reload the keys when I want to spend something, right?

Like, I can just use the bitcoin client to generate public/private key pairs, as many as I want, and then print or copy those out to paper, and then anything I send to those addresses (public keys) will be safe (safer) than if I kept it in the bitcoin application?

You could, and many people do, but the trick is getting the money you make off the sale back into the States. Good luck if you decide to try.

OK. So a wallet IS your private key. Or, your private key plus your public key. And your public key is the same as your address, right? So instead of "address" and "wallet" I should be saying "public key" and "private key" or "private/public key pairs." Cool. Thanks.

I don't know exactly if this means "good job" or "I'm clapping because you put a lot of effort into a solution that is patently wrong" but I'll accept either one as encouragement.
If it meant anything else less positive, then

Oh sorry - should have been more clear. I meant, is it mandatory, if using Linux, to use this particular distro. Sorry about that.

Ok. So I DO need to back it up, then. Correct?
