Ummm. The fees cost much more than a pizza so I'm not sure what the point of this is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:51
Half the payroll will go in to fees...
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:20:15
Hmm, is there anything he is saying that is fundamentally wrong though? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:03:55
Yeah Bitcoin won't be doing that until the fee issue is resolved.

Here you go "bud".

Bitcoin is not under attack, stop deluding yourself. 
The market doesn't like the idea of $20 fees to transfer any amount of bitcoin and is pricing accordingly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:29:24
$6.25 is better than $50.

If the mempool can get spammed and it grinds transactions to a halt, that my friend means that Bitcoin classic has a MAJOR flaw. Your comment is basically giving more credence to Bitcoin Cash being a better solution.
I think you should look at your own intelligence.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:30:57
Actually, it wouldn't. That's the point.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:36:20
It doesn't matter why or how. The fees are ridiculously high and that's a big problem for bitcoin classic.
I had to pay a $75 fee for one transaction yesterday. Made me miss my fiat bank fees.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:28:40
What you are failing to grasp is that if didn't set the fee at 1,381 sat/b then it LIKELY would not have confirmed for a very long time. So basically I either set the fee to 1,381 and have a good chance of getting it confirmed in a timely manner, or I put a smaller fee and not get a confirmation for days. This is a bad situation for both options.
Also, even if I 'triple paid' for the transaction, that's still $25. Which is stupidly high.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:45:03
If you put 0.0001 fees your transaction might never arrive or at best will arrive in several days. That's not functional in my opinion.
Can people stop pretending the fees are fine? It has gone from less than 1 cent to +$50 if you want a timely confirmation. This is a problem now, and will get worse as the landscape grows.

Gotta love the delusional misleading posts like this. This veteran economist is a Blockchain cofounder....
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:42:15
Bullshit.   Data doesn't lie.
If you paid 20c per transaction you won't get any confirmations for a very, very long time. 
How about proving me wrong by sending the txtid of your "20 cent fee" transaction being confirmed?
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:40:32
Loving how people down vote this despite it being true.
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:02:08
Same can be said about it going increasing it's value by 90%.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:22:38
So to summarise the responses posted so far:
- A few people claiming that they sent transactions with small fees and they went through (but conveniently leaving out the part about how long it took ), and unable to provide any txt ids as proof.
- My original point that it will cost you $6-$12 to get a fast confirmation still stands, and that this will only get worse as the ecosystem grows (assuming no action is taken)
- Seems like this is a sore subject for a lot of delusional purists out there. By all means, keep pretending that it doesn't cost 80+sat / b to get a confirmation in a few hours.

A house and land provides its occupant(s) with a place to live and is amongst the most useful assets to humans. Bitcoin provides no such tangible value, apart from it's potential future use-case as a digital currency. If Bitcoin disappeared nothing would really be affected outside of some cool innovation, but if houses and land started evaporating we'd have chaos. Therefore it is rational to borrow "at 4%"in a house and not rational to do the same for investing in cryptocurrencies.
Placing Bitcoin investment on the same risk-profile as housing investments is exactly the type of delusion that is concerning.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:13:16
The risk is in its value, not in it's ability to perform its function. Bitcoin could just as easily be worth one tenth of the current value and would still serve it's intended purpose as a currency.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:43:50
Data doesn't lie.
As I wrote, if you want your transaction confirmed within a few hours the current cost is ~80sat/b
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:20:08
It generally is more of a gamble than the stock market but it depends on which stocks. If we're talking blue chip stocks (which is the  majority of share capital) then it is significantly more of a gamble. Blue chip stocks have revenue and assets that is usually in line with it's share price. Bitcoin has none of those properties and it's value is propped up by pure speculation of future use and adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:10:57
Txt ID to prove it?
Yeah, thought so.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:37:26
I set a fee of 0.001 for a small btc transaction and it took over a day to get 1 confirmation. I did some research and the current price it will take to get confirmed in a reasonable time frame is around 0.0022 for a simple transaction.

We need a bit-coin ebay-type auction site. It will give loads of credibility to Bitcoin, as people are accepting bitcoin for goods, and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:21:05
Create a Bitcoin-only Ebay-type auction site. 
It will help secure Bitcoin's future as a currency.

Hey Niki,
I'm from Sydney and looking at becoming an angel investor. Perhaps we can chat.
