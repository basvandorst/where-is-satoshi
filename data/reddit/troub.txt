You asked who? The bank? "It's not our fault" is standard unhappy-customer-handling-speak, especially when information to the contrary is hard to find, or the rep doesn't really know for sure themselves. Blame the other guy, and it's up to you to spend the time to keep tracking down the blame. So it's kind of difficult to find out for sure, but here's an article that seems to have some reasonable information: [
Key points:  




* ATM withdrawals and cash out. ...  
* Gambling transactions. ...  
* Gift cards and prepaid cards. Most issuers consider the purchasing or loading value onto a gift card or other prepaid card as a “cash equivalent” transaction that is subject to the cash advance fee and interest rate.  
* Credit card checks. ...  
* Buying foreign currency or traveler’s checks. ...  
My point is, the language of the whole article is about the card *provider/issuer* and what *they* consider to be cash advance transactions, and what *kinds* of transactions are outlined in your card's Terms &amp; Conditions, etc. In other words, it is up to the *issuer* to define whether a particular transaction type falls into a category such as the above that they define as an advance transaction. Is Bitcoin a currency (and thus filed under "buying currency/traveler's checks")? Is it a store of value (such as a gift card/prepaid card/investment/cash or "cash equivalent")? Is it gambling (subject to risk/loss)? All of the above? It shouldn't be surprising.
I'm lukewarm about Coinbase, they seem to have some issues, but as far as I can tell they're *generally* a reasonable way to do a certain thing. Chase legitimately seems like an asshole bank, and they shouldn't be *closing* accounts or threatening over ACH transfers to a regulatory-compliant entity that they don't like (but again, what do I know, maybe the customers in question are overextending themselves or being otherwise risky or suspect, etc.). But closing this credit churn thing down seems like a no-brainer. Honestly.

It's possible Chase (or whatever bank) didn't do it themselves, and it was the *card network* (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx) that did it, as they apparently are the ones responsible for *assigning codes to merchants*. The IRS is also involved, at least insofar as they publish a sort of a base list for transaction reporting purposes.
It appears Coinbase could make a request to the networks to have their code category changed...what would be the upside for them? If anything, legal/regulatory/IRS reporting stuff, I suppose. But it would be something they *had* to do, rather than *wanted* to do. Most likely, if it wasn't the *bank* it sounds like it's the processor network.

Who determines whether a particular transaction/merchant/whatever is a charge or a cash advance? I would expect it's the bank, **not the merchant (Coinbase)**, though I admit I don't know for sure.


And you think the credit card company isn't getting wise to this "crazy popular" way people are *scamming* them? Whether they deserve it or not is a separate question, but why would they keep allowing this when they aren't in the business of giving away free shit for no benefit to themselves?

Opie Taylor: There is?  
Sheriff Andy Taylor: There sho' is.  
Opie Taylor: I never seen one, Pa.  
Sheriff Andy Taylor: Never seen one, what?  
Opie Taylor: A half a boy.  
Sheriff Andy Taylor: Well, it's not really a half a boy. It's a ratio.  
Opie Taylor: Horatio who?  
Sheriff Andy Taylor: Not Horatio. A ratio. It's mathematics - arithmetic. Look, now, Opie, just... forget... forget that part of it. F-f-forget the part about the half a boy.  
Opie Taylor: It's pretty hard to forget a thing like that, Pa.  
Sheriff Andy Taylor: Well, try.  
Opie Taylor: Poor Horatio!

Exactly. From what I've seen, a lot of big fast food places, Starbucks, etc. and bigger stores seem to have an armored car pickup (in the city at least; I worked fast food in a smaller town many years ago and a manager took the zipper purse). I've never seen an armored car at a mom &amp; pop, even in my crime-ridden city. *Somehow* (sarcasm italics), robberies were and are pretty damn few and far between, on the whole.

Yeah, I don't see why the 2 spaces thing is still seen as weird at all. I'm 33, which is old in internet years, but I was sure as hell taught to put two spaces after periods and colons. First learned on a typewriter, but this continued even in the computer typing classes I took (likely because the teachers all learned/used to teach on typewriters). I swear even the typing tutor software of the time (Mavis Beacon, etc.) wanted two spaces.
I only *first* heard that you're "supposed" to use one space now about a year ago. I literally had never heard that EVER until very recently.

I live in a city, and I guess there's a lot of people who try to drive off...a lot of pumps you have to pre-pay. A credit card swipe unlocks it for however much you need. Cash customers go in, lay down $20 (or whatever) and the attendant sets the pump so that it stops at $20. It would/could be exactly the same with bitcoin.

Perhaps this is why the Humble Bundle page is set up the way they are now: all of the regular pay buttons, and then a very small "or pay with Bitcoin" plain-text link underneath. It doesn't distract too much, but it's there for those of us who like to use it. I admit it took me a while to find it the first time, it was so unobtrusive.

Yeah, I saw that ad and clicked it; saw nothing and assumed it was because I didn't have any referred friends sign up. Just got the email earlier this afternoon for my $5.

Mostly, but I bought a 1/2AA battery there that I couldn't find at Target, the local hardware store, or anywhere else. Sure, it cost a ridiculous amount of money, but I was in a bit of a crunch. And of course the clerk had NO IDEA what I was talking about, so I had to find it myself. But whatever. I also was able to get a weird fuse there that the hardware store didn't have.

Eminent domain abuse, specifically. Some cases are more egregious than others, but at pretty much any point the city/govt can come to you and say "we need this for X, fair market value is...oh...30k. Take it and get lost."

Well, if they give up, won't the difficulty go back down, making it easier to be profitable (admittedly eventually, speculatively)? For instance, I've been using my old 5770 to mine some Litecoin, and until recently was able to get about a coin every 4 or 5 days (~.2-.3LTC/day). Sucks, sure, but $40 or $50 just to leave my computer running (which it is most of the time anyway)? Ok.  The difficulty's been shooting up, though, so I've shut it down because now I'm only getting something like .01 LTC/day, which is just pathetic. If the difficulty drops, I'll probably start it back up again. I've had this card for a while, so I've considered upgrading for gaming anyway and maybe getting back to a coin a week or something. LTC seems so tied to BTC, I do believe they'll both continue to rise long-term. 
I don't know how many miners would be quite ready to give up unless they're in the hole due to recent hardware purchases and had expected to derive a lot of their income from it.

Not yet, but I was going to give them a few minutes. It's only been 15 or 20 minutes and they've said elsewhere they're backed up. If it doesn't come, I'll send an email to the address posted elsewhere in the thread.

Yes, but I think the idea of doing it as you spend is because when you spend that mbtc, you're spending 'x mbtc = y USD'. At the end of the month (or beginning, for that matter), 'x mbtc' may be worth '2y USD' or .5 or .9 or 1.065 or anything else. You're probably not going to be getting a 1 to 1 replacement of what you spent; it'll be a gamble.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:04:47
That is true. I still think it would *always* be a problem, though maybe not one of terrible degree. It would still be disconcerting to not know for sure how much you'll have to spend in the future to replace (or how much you'll be able to buy this month), even if it just fluctuates a dollar or two.
I do agree that this convenience would have to be weighed against the massive load it would add to the block chain, and it just might not be practical as an large-scale automatic process.
And what you're getting at *is* probably the best way to go about it -- give yourself an "allowance" at the beginning of the month and spend from that. Since even once stabilized BTC is expected to be at least somewhat deflationary (correct?), the coins you buy at the beginning of the month will gain (even if very slightly) value throughout the month that you spend them. Then you buy the next month's coins (which would be slightly more expensive than last month's, but will buy you more, and so on). Since the conversation started with replacing coins after the fact (albeit instantly), I had started thinking in terms of replacing them at the end of the month, which would suck. But approach it the other way, as you said, and I think it would work well (when BTC is relatively stable and there less risk of a crash, correction, whatever-you-want-to-call-it).

And these take FOREVER. Which is usually fine, if you're used to that and plan for it, but then something better comes along...

I'm may be overlooking something, but even if gifts are bought with bitcoins, Bitpay (or whomever is the processor) usually converts that to local currency to pay the vendor. Presumably, they have to sell some coin to do that. So generally, it seems that even if the gifts were bought with coins, they would still end up being "cashed out," just a question of whether the buyer or seller does it.

I got that a couple of times. Ended up clicking "Sign In" and just logged in and it worked.
