You can just atomic swap for tether then.

Why would anyone be interested in this offering in the world of atomic swaps and hyperdex?

Only condition of the blockfinding bonus is you must be actively mining this round to qualify for the bonus next round! We should crack this block any minute now to begin the next round.

The difficulty has dropped already. Although an 8percent difficulty drop doesn’t mean shit when the coins value dropped 20%

Pplns pool offering zero pool fees  permanently to users whom sign up until 30ph is achieved back at the pool. Has been around since 2015 and paid out these bonuses before.

Actually yes it is really good. For years they have owned 60% of network hash rate. With them out of the game and so many competitors popping up, this can help bring some decentralization to bitcoin and its holders. This is actually the perfect time for them to go under.

Why barterdex has been flying under the radar I have no idea. They have been doing this for a while now.

I took down my initial post because I thought it was erroneous. Turns out it is real. Bitcoin just moved over $5m in volume at an all time high of $33021.44

As the title states. To further incentivize new miners, we are offering a 1 btc blockfinder bonus to anyone whom finds a block during this round mining btc. This is in addition to the zero pool fees you will have and all tx fees paid out to miners,

Nope 5.82 million in btc just moved at that price.
