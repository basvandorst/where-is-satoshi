I got a refund on postage for something I bought in btc the other day. Still sitting in my wallet. Same number of Satoshis. Hasn’t changed.
I can see that fiat currencies move around a lot in value in contrast to bitcoin. But I wouldn’t covert btc to something so unstable. Why would I do that?

Quick overview of my first Bisq transaction last night.
Note: I was selling btc in a small country for my country’s fiat.
1.	Set up account and funded it with Bitcoin. You need to have a deposit (.011 btc I think) on top of the btc you want to sell if you’re selling. This is to prevent scammers.
2.	Put in a bank account that I know will accept cash deposits in the branch. For me these seem like the best option. Don’t have to to face to face with a crazy person. You can’t reverse a cash bank deposit.
3.	Put the bitcoin up for sale at the price it was worth last night.  Requested that seller have 50% deposit to deal with me.
4.	Left the application running overnight because it has to be connected to the TOR network to work.
5.	Woke up this morning and it was sold.
6.	Says I have to wait for the deposit before I release my BTC.
7.	Four days to finalise transaction
At this stage it looks like it will work. It’s only a small transaction, so I’m thinking I just sold some anonymous, tax free btc. I’ll try to update on Monday to let you know if the transaction was successful. As with all things new when dealing btc I am cautious. Waiting to see how this dude will try to scam me.

The only way you know you can trust anybody is if they’re willing to tell you what to do in public.
Any PMs are scammers looking to steal your btc.
On a separate note, if you take the time to look up btc forks and how to claim them, you should be able to figure this out yourself. Be careful though. Some of the sites are just scammers too.

Depends on the laws in your country. Mine has decided crypto is an asset or some shit. That means if I sell it, I have to pay some kind of tax. That’s the law. If I don’t like it I can relocate or start my own country,
Or I can try to dodge tax. I’m exploring ideas.

Bitcoin is back in a big way
Bitcoin has nearly tripled over the past three months as 'fear of missing out' once again grips retail investors.
Patrick ComminsColumnist
Jun 26, 2019 — 11.46am
What's a bitcoin worth?
Right now, according to Bloomberg, a single unit of the cryptocurrency is valued at $US11,741. If you'd asked the same question three months ago, the answer would have been: a little above $US4000.
That's right, bitcoin is back in a big way. The virtual currency has jumped by 50 per cent over the past three weeks. As for what's next, the boom and bust of 2017-18 is both a warning of what can go wrong and a promise of what might come.
Bitcoin's price peaked above $US19,500 in intraday trading on December 18, 2017, after turning parabolic in the preceding weeks. At one stage it doubled in price in a mere 18 days.
There's a touch of the exponential, too, in the recent price action.
What's going on?
For one, Facebook's announcement that it is planning its own virtual currency, Libra, for its billions of active users should lift the profile of bitcoin, as well as its peers, such as ethereum or litecoin. At least that's the hope.
Investors are also drawing parallels between gold and bitcoin – the precious metal and "ultimate store of value" has also jumped and now trades at six-year highs.
Indeed, bitcoin enthusiasts refer to it as "digital gold".
Golden age
To some degree this is fair: both are alternative currencies and sit outside the reach of central bank manipulation, at a time when the guardians of fiat currencies are flagging a renewed round of extreme monetary policies.
Of course, it doesn’t help when the US President says the Federal Reserve “doesn’t know what it is doing”, as he recently opined on Twitter.
Honestly, though, this link between bitcoin and gold feels more emotional than anything else. In fact, you probably can't think of two more unlike assets – one a new and flighty virtual currency which is digitally "mined" at a rate determined by a computer algorithm, and the other a millennia-old embodiment of tangible value.
Indeed, if bitcoin represents anything, it is as the purest expression of FOMO – or "fear of missing out". There are few things more excruciating than watching your neighbour get rich. This is a market clearly driven by massive speculation. The lack of institutional involvement means retail investors and momentum-chasing rules the day.
Which begs the question: what is bitcoin really worth? Are there reliable ways to value it?
Analysts at JPMorgan reckon the best way to determine bitcoin's intrinsic value is to treat is as a commodity – it is "mined", after all. And that uses electricity. Electricity costs money, so it makes sense that people will be incentivised to mine more bitcoins for as long as the price is above the marginal cost of producing those coins.
The problem with this: it's probably bunkum. Bitcoin is designed to be used as a medium of exchange: for easy and cheap transacting across borders, remitting money back home, buying coffees, that kind of thing.
Its true value
Which means beyond the hype and the hope, the greed and the fear, the true value of bitcoin and its fellows will ultimately be driven by the degree to which people use them, Pepperstone's resident Millennial bitcoin expert Sam Holman reckons.
Daily transaction volumes in bitcoin have reached annualised levels of about $US1 trillion, near all-time highs, Holman says. Compare that to the big payment systems like Mastercard and Visa, which have annual volumes of $US4 trillion and $US8 trillion, respectively.
But how do you actually buy bitcoin? This journalist wanted to find out. No surprise, it is very easy.
First you download an app such as Coinbase, which is the largest of its type in the US and apparently 100 per cent legit. Then you verify your identity by using the app to take pictures of the front and back of  your licence. Add your credit card details and you are ready to go.
So it was that in, probably, about 10 minutes I had spent $50 buying 0.00282615 of a bitcoin, worth $47.76. That included a $1.99 transaction fee.
A hour later it was worth $48.43.
"It's difficult to pinpoint where [bitcoin's price] will stop or where it will go," Holman says. "It's hard to gauge how far this rocket will go."
Whatever: I'm riding this thing all the way to the moon.

Quick summary of my initial impressions of each website.
1. Kraken looks good.  I can't join it though because I'm in Germany
2. Vaultofsatoshi is my favourite.  Good security and easy to sign up.
3. Coinfloor has put me in a "queue" (which is very British of them) because they're not accepting new members at the moment
4. Coinsetter are in "beta" and are only "incrementally" accepting new users.
So, I guess I'm hoping vaultofsatoshi verify me and let me buy some more coin.
I wish BIPS wasn't down!!!
EDIT:  I tried itbit too but I can't remember what happened with that one...
EDIT EDIT:  Changed spelling of "queue" as suggested by dude/dudette below.

Copied a top comment from another thread:
BTC is way more hardened than bcash and not comparable at all in these regards. Bcash is just a shitcoin and no one cares if it is attacked or whatsoever.Bitcoin on the other hand has about 35 times the hashrate bcash has. So attacking it is not that easy.Also miners didn't invest millions into hardware, infrastructure, staff, facility, electricity just to render their hoarded coins and their complete business worthless and useless. So even if they could, they wouldn't do so. Furthermore there are mechanisms to defend such attacks. Andreas Antonopoulos on that topic:
