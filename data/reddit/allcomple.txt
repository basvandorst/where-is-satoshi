You know technical analysis has 0 to do with fundamentals of the underlying asset? So what your saying is irrelevant. There's been lots of strong bear signals on the charts and the price has indeed followed.

So the current popularity of Bitcoin makes it the best? Sounds like a pretty weak reason.

No of course they wont, but that is why I keep my money in a bank. If I held bitcoin I would have to make my own provisions to safeguard my money. Vaults, encrypted USB sticks or a safety deposit box at a bank. 
Yeah I can keep my bitcoin on an online wallet, but if that company goes bankrupt; goodbye bitcoins. If my bank goes bust I'm insured up to £30k per bank account. 


So these people don't have access to bank accounts or credit cards, but do have access to portable devices connected to the internet to spend?


There's no evidence that he doesn't have the private keys to them either. On the balance of probabilities, he probably does have the private keys still.. If he moved just one coin, this place would explode with excitement and then the market would price in the 1,000,000 extra bitcoins which have just been proved to be in circulation. 


New features = new bugs. 


..and What fraud protection do I get with Bitcoin? None, if I lose my bitcoins because I got hacked, It's my fault and I'll have to just deal with it. I must not have followed the 30 steps to ensure safe use of bitcoin.


Email has a tonne of advantages over Fax for end users, that's why it has ultimately succeeded. Bitcoin is more complicated, provides no insurance against losses and slower than current mechanisms to pay for goods.


Like how MySpace had to monopoly on the social networking sector? Something better came along, everyone jumped ship. Same thing could happen here.
How much do you stand to lose if Bitcoin fails? Would you care if Bitcoin failed as long as another superior cryto took over and solves all the problems you've been talking about? Because none of the issues you have mentioned can only be solved by Bitcoin specifically.

Those 10 have lost about 5% in value against the dollar plus any fees you accrued getting them since this morning. Why are you buying in a falling market? Serious question. Why doesn't every wait for a trend reversal 
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:09:13
I'm willing to change my opinion. But I see more negatives than positives at the moment.

Forex has zero utility?

Define: Value.
estimate the monetary worth of.
"his estate was valued at £45,000"
Edit: "his bitcoin *was* valued at $1000"

The fraudster? Criminals shouldn't have their assets seized? Is that because the only good application I've found with bitcoin is buying illegal goods?


Cars have clear advantages over horses for transportation. 
Bitcoin doesn't have clear advantages over cash or credit/debit cards for 1st world consumers, in fact it carries many disadvantages at the moment.


I was responding to his comment that more features = less bugs. Which was a ridiculous statement. 


I've not heard of that no, but I'll check it out. 
My comment was regarding how difficult bitcoin is to use currently, and that most 1st world consumers wouldn't care to check out the inner workings to understand the "rules". They just want a quick and safe way to spend or transfer cash. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:13:26
Other than liquidity does bitcoin offer any advantages over another altcoin such as litecoin?
@_date: 2014-07-29 20:12:32
Well, Good luck with your investment, you truly believe in it. I'll be watching with interest.
I'm still not convinced, but I hope it works out for you. :)

Except what you've already got is currently losing value?

Desperate move

*     You can store it yourself without the need of a bank
Is this a good thing? Never heard of anyone having money stolen from the bank and not getting it back. But have heard countless stories of people getting hacked and losing all their bitcoins. I don't want to have to build a vault in my house to store my wealth.
        
*     It's accepted all over the world
Maybe, but in very very few places. I live in London and seen 'Bitcoin accepted here' maybe twice, and when I tried paying with Bitcoin it took 25minutes. 
My Mastercard however is truly accepted all over the world and offers me insurance and a decent exchange rate.
*     You can send it to anyone, anywhere in the world without fees
Until you have to exchange it into a currency you can actually spend...
And there are fees, how would miners get paid in the future otherwise?
*     Created by the people, for the people. Nobody owns its technology.
What % of total Bitcoins does Satoshi own? 10%? Not good.
*     Being upgraded constantly
More bugs.
*     Accessible by anyone and anyone can upgrade and view its inner workings (transparent)
How is this a good thing? Most people barely understand what bitcoin is let alone understand its inner workings.
I've not been given one convincing reason why Bitcoin is good for the average joe consumer :( 
@_date: 2014-10-05 06:16:17
So Bitcoin isn't a currency now? Because charts work just fine with Forex

Except this time it isn't falling because of negative news

Yeah some banks may not cover you, but in the EU we are generally very well protected. The fact is, no one will cover you if you lose your private key or if someone steals it. 


If I tell my bank I'm going there before I travel, it won't get declined. I know because I've done it.
Yeah you can't use Mastercard everywhere in Africa or India. Can I use bitcoin everywhere in India or Africa? No, not without an internet connection.


Why would anyone accept an asset as payment which fluctuates so wildly? It's such a hard sell. Save 3% card fees today, loses 20% value the next... 


OK, He ONLY owns an estimated 7%, he could sell up and send the price through the floor. What makes you think he won't? 


Upgrades do not mean less bugs, more features = more potential bugs. I do not pay anything for fraud protection on my bank accounts or credit cards. 


I don't dispute crypto currency could be an amazing thing, I would love it to become a reality, but it requires so much to change I can't see it happening anytime soon. The current system isn't broken enough for the entire world to have to change. 
And, why Bitcoin? It's come so far it 3 years, but what's stopping another crypto becoming 'the next big thing'. Just because it was the first doesn't mean it's the best, remember Lycos?
