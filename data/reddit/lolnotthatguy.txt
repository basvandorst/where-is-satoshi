Haha in India you have to get clearance from a bank to make an international remittance. If I make it in small amounts. The transactions fess would make it pointless

How ??? Just depositing money is costing me that percentage
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:17:40
Yeah couple of millions
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:47:53
Yeah but I can’t. There is no way to buy bitcoin in India. Every website is dodgy as fuck

What I meant was, someone is supposed to pay me money with which I can buy couple more bitcoin. That payment is due in 3-4 days. Sorry for the poorly worded comment before

What constitutes running a node ? If you can explain in it layman language I would be very grateful.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:08:52
I can buy 2btc in the blink of an eye. 4 if I can wait fora another 3-4 days

Thanks for explaining. couple more questions, how much would it cost me to run a node, any special equipment needed? and do i have to be a tech person to do it ?
I like the rationale behind running one, its a greater cause.

No that fees is what I need to pay to make a bank to bank transfer from one Fiat currency to another Fiat currency.
