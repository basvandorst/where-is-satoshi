Well everybody was so happy to see Wall Street coming into the crypto-currencies world, now enjoy being fucked by professional traders.
They will play the swing up and down till you are all broke.

I'm sure their trading bots will take care of that.

What feels weird is bitfinex price always being a lot lower than on any other exchange, this and the enormous amount of flash-crashes (sometimes price : 3) they have since the last 3 days, oh and the fact that they have an enormous amount of BTC and at the same time controlling the supply of fake dollars (USDT).
Always look who benefits from the crime and if your add the trading fees due to the mass amount of stop-loss on top of that, my bet is on bitfinex.

Zcash CEO is fine with backdoors for LEO so I would say in the trash.

Looks like I'm not the only one wondering : 
Anyway, Coinbase is higher than average among the top 10 volumes but it's not completely out of range like bitfinex. Bitfinex is dragging the market down with a ridiculous market cap.

IOTA doesn't even work with no real use. Maybe Byteball or Raiblocks.
It's great to read this post, usually this chan is filled with delusional mooners who think 30$ fee and 60 min confirmation time is fine.

The thing is, short-selling cryptos is now possible.
