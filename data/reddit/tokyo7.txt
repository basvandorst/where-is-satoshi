What did the letter say? I didn't actually get a letter - but I feel like I'll get one shortly?
I just went to buy a bulk load of crypto (wanted to increase my exposure on some new altcoins) (which I've done before numerous times without issue) and it declined my transaction and told me to call a number to get it pushed through... I rang them - they interrogated me and said 'sorry we can't push this through and due to the activity - we've also disabled your account - you'll need to go to a branch, verify who you are and explain the situation'.
I then went in and got grilled again - including a conversation with some fraud guy who seemed very un-impressed / was asking lots of questions ... he was making the case that 'lots of people had been scammed' and so they had this sort of stuff on lock down... eventually he relented and re activated the account.
It makes me feel more confident about investing in crypto, if the people who work in the banking industry still treat it like its something 'strange' that only a 'weirdo' / 'criminal' would be meddling in - then we know we have a long way yet to grow as a currency (and thus there's still plenty of money to be made by HODLING).

I had a similar problem the other day with Halifax Bank (UK) ... they totally locked down my account - I had to go in branch and verify who I was and speak on the phone with their fraud department to explain what i was doing before they gave me access again
