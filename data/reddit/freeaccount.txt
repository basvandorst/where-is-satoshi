No, but you can go onto e-bay and buy an S3 antminer and a power supply. 
Then plug it in and you will start making Bitcoin.
No age requirements at all.

Another interesting stat, a year ago that 4TH/s would have earned you 40 Bitcoin *every single day*. 
Today, 4 TH/s will earn you 0.08436 Bitcoin per day.

The problem with polls that ask whether or not you "know about something" is that people don't want to feel like idiots who don't know anything. You've got some professional poll person asking you a question, you don't want to look stupid. 
This tends to make them lie about whether or not they know about it. 
I can say that the people coming in to our company trust us and have already spent a lot of time listening to us tell them how things work in regards to their PC. They are already in the position where we know everything and they don't, so they don't need to lie about not being tech savvy. 
So when I tell them that the machine is "mining for Bitcoin", if they don't know anything about it, they're not going to lie. They trust us and feel comfortable with us knowing they don't know about something.

Where did you hear this? 
Bitmain has actually lowered the price again, looks like its only $213.50 on their site now...

This was 100% true up until about a week ago when you could buy an S1 for $250. 
S1's run like champs, and at a cost of $1250/THs (oc'd) they're one of the first miners that will for sure make ROI.
