Just hit 22k AUD on Australian exchanges! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:30:04
Yeah... That's not normal for Australia. We normally pay $3 - $4 (AUD). And that's for a very good barista made coffee. Can always get a semi decent 7-11 coffee for $1.

That's the first thing that came to my mind when I read this article.
Off to do some research... Will report back if I find anything.

Toro are a CFD provider. You are trading contracts for differences between yourself and them. You aren't buying any crypto currency through them. 
This isn't the same as leaving your crypto on a centralised exchange which may get hacked. CFD providers are insured and regulated by governments similar to stock brokers.

I don't think you understand what a CFD is, which is what eToro provides.
It's a contract between yourself and the CFD provider over the price of an asset (e.g. Bitcoin).
Toro do not sell you Bitcoin. They simply allow you to bet on the price of it going up or down.
Your statement is correct, I agree. It just doesn't apply in this particular instance as you are not buying any coins, but instead just betting on the price.

I'm with you. I would always prefer to be in control of my crypto.
I was just pointing out the "not your keys not your crypto" argument doesn't work here. It's a CFD, a completely different financial instrument.
Also if Binance gets hacked or goes bankrupt, you're fked. You'll lose all your funds on the exchange.
If the same thing happens to a CFD provider, there is insurance and regulations to protect the consumer.

What a completely cherry picked number: one year ago.
Such a strange period of time to measure the financial performance of an asset. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:57:22
You guys need to chill. I'm not some crazy bitcoin maximist or anything.
I've literally said one thing: that a 12 month timeframe is not an arbitrary or cherry picked number when measuring the financial performance of an asset.

When you see financial statements, what does MTD and YTD mean? 
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:42:51
Nvidia today: $247
Nvidia one year ago: $153
How is that 166%?

To measure the financial performance of an asset, a 12 month timeframe is not an arbitrary number. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:05:34
At any point in time, you can compare it to the price 12 months ago.
It won't be a "cherry picked" timeframe then either. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:56:03
What's the YTD return for bitcoin right now? 
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:44:34
If there are accusations of cherry picking numbers because they used a 12 month timeframe, then yeah sure, I'll post it again if I see it.
