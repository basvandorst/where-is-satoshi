It's less than £5000 unless your a company

Not if a bank declares it can't pay/wont, then you ONLY have a government hand out that is bugger all.

Just your management firm, that's the only point of failure it takes to lose everything.

What 'actually' happened when banks and investment companies have failed in the past. How the smaller savers have always been hung out to dry in every case. Brussels platitudes about liquidity and guarantees are there only for public perception. When the banking crisis hit, people across Europe found when it came to actually getting money from failed financial institutions the public were very last on the list of priorities. Yes some new liquidity laws have been passed so (in theory) a bank that keeps to all the rules could pay out, but even then it isn't 1 to 1 the actual structure is 20c per €1 up to €100000 and only then if the money exists. Of course, if that money existed there would be no need for invoking that rule in the first place. If it doesn't exist that guarantee is void as the Liquidator sizes all assets. The 'guarentee' does now technically extend to other banks in the same group in theory, but that has never been tested in court. If a foreign banking group refuses to accept they are liable for a partners debts in your country that is uncharted water and small savers will lose that fight, back to where you were before.

A bank (any bank in the world) rarely has more than 20℅ of deposits in any way reachable at a set time. When a bank goes tits up, they can't just ask for the lost money to be printed. 
Most customers will have less than €5000 in a current account, and most domestic customers only have such an account, they will get precedence. Second is corporate accounts and last on the list is savers.
EU law does 'look' like it gives protection but has never been tested in anger. No bank has failed since these were rushed in after the last crash. Italy may be the first to see this and already people are issuing warnings that the 'guarentee' is meaningless where the unrecoverable debt is over 60℅ even before a crash.
Savers will always be screwed by the financial market no matter what governments tell them they must do. Greek and Spanish banks are also unlikely to comply with the EU directive on this. UK banks already reduced the amount they even claim to guarantee. The concept of a third party in any way insuring the banks is ridiculous, only a countries government might choose to honour a fraction of such debts should any chain kick a bank out (breaking it's link) prior to a bankruptcy. There is no legal way to force another bank to pay out in that case. 
It's theatre to promote confidence, nothing more.

Invest €10000 and your insurance would cover you for €1000 I believe. Less if it's a bigger problem. My point wasn't actually that these are uUNtrustworthy, just that the security argument isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Almost Certain as in "What we'd really like you to believe we suspect" as opposed to "based on any actual proof, or investigation, or effort having been expended"

Possibly Frances stance on crypto control to avoid tax evasion etc - they refused to rule out an all out ban.
My guess is many French in power missed the boat and want to create dips to buy in.

OK. lets be a little serious here. HSBC bought a bank that was involved in Money Laundering. Then after threats against employees and their families from organised crime - the new staff didn't report this or have it ended. THAT's why no one went to jail over it.
It seems Charlie got really unlucky and caught up in a 'We must be seen to take action' crusade that was quite frankly wrong. He also **pleaded guilty** to, and was sentenced for, aiding and abetting unlicensed money transmissions - not money laundering.

Well, let's be honest - in the traditional sense Bitcoin IS a bubble. But it keeps inflating after each burst.
Remember when it was $0.36 and the bubble burst with its price crashing to $0.21? Or when it was at $50 and the bubble burst and it crashed to $30?
Or when it was at $1100 and it completely collapsed to $300? 
It really IS a bubble waiting to burst again! And again! And again! See you at $250.000! :)

Greece have defaulted on National loans with times in the last 150 years. It honestly wouldn't be sensible to loan without security at this point. To be honest, the last two generations ALREADY sold the country to Europe, maybe it's time to collect.

Except you didn't, not in this world. Oh, wait, were you pretending to be from a cartoon?

And I do, but that doesn't mean 'never, ever ever sell anything at any point ever'
I have held since the early days and still have a decent number of coins. If I decide I need money, I will cash in again but until then I still buy with my spare cash during dips.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:14:18
As a long term crypto investor, if my entire remaining holding becomes worthless I will only have made enough to clear all my loans and buy my house outright. Just from what I already sold I am way ahead, so stupid me huh?

Yep, the US banks are going to be deeply affected by the China crash when it happens. More bailouts ahead for profiting now.

Nearly everyone. Most of what you buy has components (if not the whole product) sourced from overseas and you are paying a premium for third party services that do the conversion for you and add their profits on top.
Just because the markets are local today does not mean this is the best way, or the cheapest. Bitcoin (or what it represents, I don't see Bitcoin in anything like it's current form getting general acceptance) is a move towards that more global economy and market.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:20:14
Which would only make any fiscal sense if the borrowing didn't outpace inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:35:45
They own somewhat less than 20%, yes. But they still can't lose, and that still doesn't demonstrate any way a Government can benefit from increased tax due to inflation.
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:07:22
Technically he said N'obody went to jail for the 2008 crisis' which is 'tecnically' correct. People went to jail for Tarp fraud introduced to HELP in the aftermath, so unrelated. No bankers were jailed for causing the crises but some brokers were for cashing in.

Governments don't get any money. It goes via the banks, Government has no say in how much or when money is printed? They can only make recommendations.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:57:49
The game NEVER EVER worked like that. Not even slightly, not even seen in a bad light from a distance!
The banks started with zero regulation. It was introduced to stop the worst offences, then changed to limit or prevent competition. 
YOU try again, maybe after learning what your talking about.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:03:44
But that was entirely my point? People claim inflationary currency is the only system that can work ONLY because it's the only system that they know. A loaf of bread is worth the nutritional value, we are used to prices going up rather than down but there IS no real difference.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:54:44
Inflation does not, and cannot, 'raise taxes' as those taxes are then used on services/goods at the inflated rates. Governments do not benefit from inflation, only those printing the money do.

In the UK the post offices are more and more frequently just in small shops and mainly rely on income from other services such as Passports, license, giro accounts, benefits payments etc. etc. etc.

Based on FIAT currency markets only. Actually, commodity based trading is way older (and still very much around) but there are no records for them as a general economy.

Again, please read comments before replying, HSBC bought the Mexican bank that was engaged in money laundering. THEY reported it and that bank got fined for current and historic wrongdoing. Noone got fired because having a threat against your family doesn't leave you much of a choice. It's pretty nice to just believe bank = evil without trying to understand any of the facts.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:21:01
Ignorance really is bliss for haters!
HSBC BOUGHT a bank already having problems. They actually didn't sack anyone because they felt having organised crime threaten your family was a good enough reason to breach rules if the authorities were not willing to help.
They changed the processes to make such things much more difficult and also THEY reported the irregularities, they didn't try to hide it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:02:37
So stating facts makes you a Shill now? Must make life SO much easier if you disregard everything you hear that you don't want to be true. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:23:08
Never had a problem with it whilst with them. But have had an account for 30 years and have a business account with them too. I don't know if that buys good will.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:15:16
HSBC have had no issues with my Bitcoin sales previously.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:10:04
Scummy bank. Yeah I have read all that before. HSBC come forward with problems all banks are having, all banks get investigated but some people think the first to come forward means worst offender? 
HSBC were also the first to pull out of the sub prime mortgages before the crash and have a superb record for customer service. Maybe look in to the reasons for investigations some time. The facts tell a different story. Most of the 'scandals' have occurred after HSBC buys a bank then revealed long standing illegal activity as part of their process to stop it. Of course, their practice of renaming banks HSBC makes that hard to see sometimes.
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:43:07
You forget, they don't KNOW they arn't effective at regulating the banks ;) Secretly they are just hoping for new paymasters AS WELL as the banks.
