Not true, you can donate to AntiWar.com with bitcoin or credit cards anonymously. You can also provide your info and write it off on your taxes if you wish.

1) electrum offers an auto sweep function, but I have never used it.
2) use Bit.co.in or OneName.io when publishing a donation request in a book or print anything.

AntiWar.com, but I have also supported other great groups like Fr33Aid, Seans Outpost and EFF, but AntiWar is the one most important to me.

this is great news, I have enjoyed watching CoinKite grow its wallet this year and this is really the icing on the cake!
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:08:34
I don't always use a hosted bitcoin wallet... 
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:19:43
thanks again for the support...

But if there is no fold app, how did just just buy this cup of coffee... 
Remember, there is no spoon either.

I would agree that this is vandalism, but it's not for me to judge why this person expressed him/her self this way. Maybe the wall aggressed against them first, you never know.

Updated the header on our site in response. Hope the graffiti artist sees this :)

Great job Will and the whole Milwaukee crew!

CashIntoCoins.com You could still be anonymous but I think you would have to buy less them 10,000 a day.
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:29:57
I do see it from your perspective, and thanks for any and all feedback! we want to make this successful project for everyone!
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:19:34

@_date: 2013-09-14 08:23:09
Thanks for the support y'all!

We just put our Bitcoin Not Bombs honey badger shirts and hoodies on sale, but BitMit is also a great place to look around on. Also, I love  for first time purchases.
@_date: 2013-09-09 22:50:41
We have 30 days to finalize the design and need peoples feedback, I will post a full size image soon. Thanks for looking!
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:57:02
thanks buddy! 
@_date: 2013-09-10 03:36:34
We do give a bit about the homeless, I'm sorry you don't find this project valuable, 
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:20:29
Thanks for adding us! Hope it goes well!
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:31:02
I like that idea! We have been talking with Jason King about how to cross promote our efforts.
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:29:59
now that magic the gathering cards are for sale on bitmit.net MtGox is completely irrelivent
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:54:05
Fr33Aid is matching up to 10 BTC, the post has been updated.
@_date: 2013-09-10 04:10:27
Thanks, just to be clear we are not set on what the art will be.

I got a quote from our vendor on bulk blankets but it's still cheeper to buy fleece fabric from a bulk discount fabric store and cut them in to square blankets. Maybe just do a spry paint stencil with messages on them. I also love the idea of putting your lawyers number on them. And yeah get video! Best of luck to you Jason, this is just awful!
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:05:55
I don't know but Fr33Aid is taking Bitcoin donations to help out in the Philippines, up to 10 BTC in matching funds too! 
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:57:37
This video was very helpful for me and Matt is a great guy!  
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:40:25
No offense taken, I look forward to showing the results of the 4.2+ BTC Fr33aid.com has gotten so far. We will be completely transparent. I will gladly PM you with a updated blog post that will be done showing our successes and the efforts on the ground.
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:58:14
Thanks for adding us, hope you keep building momentum!
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:08:22
Great job!
@_date: 2013-09-10 03:12:25
I do my best to help people in need as I can, I can't afford this many hoddie on my own and in this way we can show the power of distributed funding in bitcoin. The PR campaign is just an added bonus that could attract more people to support the effort and get them involved in creating the art, we plan on sending out press announcements to the SF media and welcome all the flak they will give us for "exploiting" the homeless. Something I dont think we are doing.
@_date: 2013-09-09 01:32:40
We will have to work on that, we are out of our BNB sticker so we should look in to ordering more. thanks for looking!
@_date: 2013-09-10 02:35:24
I'm sure we will get lots of flak for this but people in need, need to stay warm this winter, hipsters can just ask mom for a new hoodies. it's a win win in my mind.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:05:45
