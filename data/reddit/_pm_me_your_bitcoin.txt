Anonymous source? Ok, let's assume Wright himself is the source.
1) Blogposts can be very easily edited (and they were). No evidence.
2) Close email adress names? really? No evidence.
3) Leaked emails, transcripts, and accounting in text form. Takes no time for a 10 year old to fake those.
4) Kleiman died in 2013 and can't be questioned if the emails are real. Very convenient.
5) Tulip Trust PDF signed by Kleiman. Now this looks like very strong evidence. Unless Wright got the PGP key from Kleiman after his death or wired didn't check if it's legit.
6) McGrathNicol liquidation report: Wright owned $23 million in bitcoins in June 2013. Bitcoin price in june 2013 ~$100? That's ~230,000 coins. That's strong evidence he's Satoshi or at least a very early adopter genius who believed in bitcoin from the start.
7) More easily fakeable emails. No evidence.
8) Tessier-Ashpool email: uses the same email service as satoshi. No evidence and to be expected if he wanted to fake it.
But the email content is a bit worrying. I didn't read the books but it appears like Tessier-Ashpool is a ultra-rich family investing in AI, spacestations etc. If he is satoshi he probably plans to use his money and didn't destroy any keys FYI.
9) Profile matches.
=&gt; 75% he's Satoshi. 25% he's a very early adopter and faked the evidence

Does this at all match with the early mining Satoshi did? I thought he used a few PCs in the early days but nothing so extreme?
