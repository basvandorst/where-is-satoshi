you put money into loads of things without knowing where it goes to....... charity money for example.
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:21:24
if thousands of people put money into a firm which looks legitimate and everyone for the past however long has been doing it, what would the worry be for? its like going to your nearest supermarket for the past 5 years and all of the sudden you get robbed.

i meant to write that I'm buying btc for btc price + 5% and i wouldn't want to do person trades as i could easily be robbed, also i wouldn't feel comfortable doing that method, cant he just take the money, and say what money? as theres no proof i gave him any money

had a little look, looks informative but not too cluttered, good work man, will read it when i have the chance to. Thanks

did you mean to write "clone base" as a play on words? if so could you say why anyone can use my wallet please
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:08:03
thanks, I'm just considering investing x amount of money per week

i know a guy who takes skill for 5% fee, so BTC price + 5%, is this worth it?
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:32:10
definitely not going trading in person =/
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:01:42
except for the "a" which i probably accidentally typed, could you elaborate where my grammar was too unbearable, thanks for your criticism as this probably is your only hobby

"You may also be eligible to use the Coinbase Services if you are at least 13 years old" Thanks, if they ask to see verification, i can just use this excuse right?
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:03:57
perhaps i am a kid, but id rather just buy bitcoin from a person, and if its not a wallet, does that mean i cant hold any btc in there

why? if coinbase does not want to sell to nationwide bank users, they dont have to? why does everyone carry the sense of them verus us?

building a house is dangerous? driving a car is dangerous? fishing without a license has consequences for the environment?

tax still pays for your security, schools etc.  also looking at your accounts comment history, you are genuinely a bitcoin fanatic lol. Chill out with this anti government bs 
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:29:21
you only see negative comments.. no one comments positive things. Why would people post good comments when it is expected for them to be satisfied. Itll be unusual for them to be unsatisfied hence the posts...
@_date: 2016-09-09 12:11:00
if the whole world gets integrated with bitcoin, so paid in bitcoin how will tax work and why would you down vote my post?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:11:40
so if you have 1btc, you get 1 bcc for free?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:54:34
could you guide me on how to do it please
