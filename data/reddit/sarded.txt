While there is, it's irrelevant to my comment.

I would love to eat cruelty free meat and other animal products.  
It's cheaper not to! So all my eggs are cage eggs. It's the same for many people.  
But at least I can be reasonably sure all those eggs and the way they're produced meet a minimum quality standard and are unlikely to harm me.
If you don't have an enforced minimum standard, then at the poorest level what you end up with is "I would love not to eat these death-eggs. Unfortunately they're much cheaper than eggs that don't have a significant salmonella risk. Oh well!"

You consent to government the instant you use something the government helped produce.  
This includes most buildings, if they're up to a government-regulated building code.  
It includes most foods, to be up to minimal standards of not-poison.  
It includes most timekeeping standards.  
It includes modes of transport - including vehicle standards as well as infrastructure (roads, rails, air traffic regulations, etc)
If you don't want to consent to any of that, stop using them.

I'm assuming USA (though I am not a US citizen myself), but I am specifically referring to bodies such as the FDA, NIST, Department of Agriculture, Association of Transport Officials, and Weights&amp;Measures.   
Standards are only standard if they're enforced. Any enforcing body (with actual ability to enforce and penalise) is a de-facto government.

Gotta have some kind of body to provide social welfare and justice enforcement.  
If you have it done by a corporation then it's still a de facto government.
