There is no single company that has the ability to "control Bitcoin." Bitmain can signal whatever they want, but the masses who actually use Bitcoin never wanted, don't want, and will never want his handicapped version of Bitcoin. You've been reading too much FUD my friend.
Hodlers/the general users will always determine the course.

So, did you learn to 
- enable 2 factor authentication on every site you use?
- never resuse a password?
- send your naked pictures via Snapchat, or Signal?
Frankly, by what youve written, it sounds like you had major flaws in your opsec. If you had 2 factor auth enabled, none of this would have happened, guaranteed.

the simple quote "swiss bank in your pocket" is enough to send anyone tired of banks' games running to find out what Obama was referring to. 
Obama probably boosted user adoption of Bitcoin thanks to those five words.
You're overthinking it.

I can't advise you on your issue with Bitcoin core, but what I can do for you is save you from transferring funds to blockchain.info.
No web wallet is as secure as a hardware wallet, or even a mobile wallet. Storing your funds on blockchain.info means you are not in sole possession of your keys, your funds may inexplicably vanish at any time, and good luck trying to hunt them down.
There are a multitude of good wallets. Mycelium is very popular one.

it's not in the interest of any bank to see bitcoin succeed.

Increasing adoption, increasing "I'm- gonna-miss-out-so-better-buy-now" syndrome

This whole time I assumed everyone sent coin to an intermediary wallet before sending to gambling sites... This is becoming almost as frequent as people asking if Coinbase is good for long term storage
