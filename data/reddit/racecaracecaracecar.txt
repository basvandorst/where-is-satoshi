Because puts a friendly face on cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin needed to be super serious to be taken seriously, but dogecoin has found success in being easily marketable. Maybe they both need to stay clearly separate, but a little more friendliness might not hurt Bitcoin.

I never made any comment on intentions or altruism. I merely commented on appearance. Dogecoin appears "friendly" and "approachable", which is just good marketing.

Can they refund it? I was under the impression that fee goes out into the ether and whoever processed the transaction keeps it, not the payer or payee.

You're going to need to space it out like this: h u n t e r 2 (just using my password as an example). Otherwise it gets autocensored.

Yeah, I was tempted after the price increase, but now I'm glad I stuck on.

I left my computer solo mining today. Can't wait to go home and see if I struck the lottery. (spoiler alert: no) edit: confirmed, no. betting on red again.

You are so smart.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:06:03
Yeah, that's why I went in. I'm not even counting on making money back, just indulging my geeky hobby. I guess that's why it hurts wandering in the wilderness on this waiting to find out if this was for real.

When will BFL voting ASICs start to ship? "Two terms."

This kills the currency.

It's an ASIC, I don't think there's anything you can do with it other than mine bitcoins. And you're in line behind people who have had their orders in for a year now. I'm waiting on a little SC, so I'm right there with you. My philosophy is that even if it takes the life of the ASIC to break even, it's a fun geeky hobby. It's why I mine with an Nvidia card now. My bitnickle isn't going to offset my power used to mine it, but it's fun having it.
