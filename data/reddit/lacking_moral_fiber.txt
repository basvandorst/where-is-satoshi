No. The price action is what snapped people out of their dream state. That reaction in traders/investors was predicated on the exchange rolling over.

As someone who as felt kinda the same way as you, today, based on advice from other redditors, I looked into CAMPBX. They are domestic US. You can send money orders to them. Their website is functional and they explain everything. I will be sending them a USPS money order later today. So many other sites are offshore and the funding options get a little tricky. At least for me. So its CAMPBX for me.

People are selling. If there were no sell orders, there would be no buy orders getting filled.
The issue here (its a great thing for BTC holderes) is that there are too many hands chasing too few coins right now. Thats why Ive come to believe the prices goes much higher from here. Not from technical analysis. Not from historical bubble stats. From the notion that as people, especially younger people, become aware of BTC, they will buy in. Getting setup to trade isnt that easy. It takes time, so there are many who are just now considering a BTC account. For me its simply demand for the coins-screw Cyprus, screw hedging, screw libertarian politics-its demand for the coins without any ideology attached (except for a scant few who will claim its now a new dawn of libtard economics). People want to get rich the easy way. Im rooting for ya! But I cant help but expect this to end badly. It usually does for us peons.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:53:03
Donations? Really?
If you are in the US: Go to CAMPBX.com, sign up, go to the post office, buy a money order for $xxx. Express Mail the money order to their Atlanta office. You will be trading within 24-48 hours with a US based company. The best thing is the tiny transaction fees. Only 0.55% fee. No fee to open an account. No free to transfer funds into the account. If you buy $100 US  worth of bitcoin, you will pay 55 cents in commissions. Thats awesome.

I hope for the best for you. Listen, I lost $400K during the market crash of the dot com bubble. It hurt me and my relationships in so many ways. I have crusaded against anyone I come in contact with ever trading stocks. Trading BTC is infinitely worse than stocks. But what is done is done. You cant unring a bell. So, now what to do? Admit you were wrong. Admit defeat. Show remorse. Ask for forgivness. Work on putting this shit behind you. Get the fuck off of reddit and get on with repairing your relationship(s).

The issue with the USPS has nothing to do with email. It has to do with the gop forcing the USPS to fund, in its entirety, all future pensions (out 75 years) and to do so within a three year period. It was done to destroy the USPS. Its all but worked.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:58:11
In order for $70 to be considered support, it would have to act as support. That has not occurred. prices jump higher, and drift down to $70 and it holds, thats called support. Not when the price is $55 and then wanders up to $70ish. Lets not confuse the folks here.

The coming tsunami will be with the exchanges and with account hacks.
The exchanges are anything but transparent. With the "lags" (yeah, right) theres opportunities galore to frontrun orders and manipulate markets.
If a few sites get hacked and account holders lose all their BTC, then massive selling will ensue and future deposits will dry up.

Viable future currency or accident waiting to happen?
Id say both. If you think adoption of a radical new currency will be smooth and uneventfull, you are nuts. There are powerful forces that will look to tamp down BTC if it begins to have any legitimate uses. And the price action will prly be wild to say the least. So your libtard wet dreams are not yet to be realized.

I can imagine a huge price drop. Its possible.
Im inclined to think that a serious challenge to BTC acceptance would be if multiple sites were comprimised and a hunderds/thousands of BTC traders lost all their funds (not saing it will happen). That would scare off almost everyone.

Were it not for fear around these parts, well, there wouldnt be any entertainment. Every jump in BTC prices is met with universal celebration that the coinage is gaining acceptance (like that idiotic unfounded claim that BTC took off as a result of Cyprus) and all price drops are the fault of untoward forces out to stop the spead of BTC. And these same people decry regulation. Yeah, right. When exchanges close and take all the money with them, see how much you want regulation. Lag times and price fixing are happening right before your eyes and you refuse to accept that this unregulated clusterfuck will soon crash and burn.

If you are in the US: Go to CAMPBX.com, sign up, go to the post office, buy a money order for $xxx. Express Mail the money order to their Atlanta office. You will be trading within 24-48 hours with a US based company. The best thing is the tiny transaction fees. Only 0.55% fee. No fee to open an account. No free to transfer funds into the account. If you buy $100 US  worth of bitcoin, you will pay 55 cents in commissions. Thats awesome.

@_date: 2013-04-02 11:51:03
We have heard this explanation ad nauseum with zero facts to back it up.
Are we to believe that, in lieu of the Cyprus banking mess, that hundreds, even thousands of people around the world looked at this tiny little island and decided " Hey, Im going to buy bitcoins to hedge against a banking collapse. Now, how do I buy the coins? Where do I keep them? How do I transfer money into an account to buy bitcoins? Which vendors, if any, accept bitcoins? Do bitcoins really hedge against anything?" So Cyprus caused the jump in bitcoin prices that began in Feb 2013? Thats simply untrue. Nothing factual points to a connection between Cyprus and bitcoin.
Its the marketers of bitcoin who are pushing this bullshit narrative. Cyprus and bitcoin are 100% de-coupled.
Bitcoin has no known use as a hedge. It is purely a speculative trade, not that its a bad thing. It just is.

Just because a few people want it to be, doesnt make it so. BTC is not a commentary on libertarian economics. Its a speculation vehicle for most people. While I applaud the stick it to the man attitude, well, it aint the 10th grade no more. I read post after post extolling the virtues of BTC, saying its a hedge, claiming the price rise has something to do with Cyprus and proclaiming the dollar is dead. Maybe, but its against some huge odds. Still, that doesnt mean the price of BTC wont continue on a tear.

Great advice. One cant stress how difficult trading something like bitcoin, or stock, can be. When you are the smallest of the small, without sophisticated trading tools and information, you can tend to become obsessed with your bitcoins price.
As a daytrader from 1996-2003, I can tell you that the hardest thing I have ever faced, ever, was knowing when to sell a stock/option. It was gut-wrenchingly painful to watch thousands of dollars of profit vaporize in the blink of an eye.
Trading bitcoin will test your mettle. Trading is not for everyone. If you decide to sell out, you cant look back. 
Seek out books/forum on stock trading to get a better understanding of how markets work. If you life is being rules by bitcoin prices, its unhealthy. You may be what is called a "weak hand". These are the folks who sell out way too early when the proverbial tree gets shaken. Whats that mean? Well, regardless of what others say, this market can be manupilated to a degree. When you see prices falling, your mind says sell before the price goes lower. 
I really sympathize with folks in this situation. 
As with any trade, you must know your parameters for success/failure. Know when you expect to sell and where you will buy. Have discipline. Selling small lots of coins over the course of time is a good strategy, but can be hard for noobs to execute.

The reason TA is popular is not unlike the reason bitcoin is popular.
TA only works if enough people believe it works. There is no fundamental reason for price action to be dependent of past movements. Its like playing roulette and believing that too many odd/even red/black numbers in a row can be bet against.
Bitcoin exists in the same universe. It has value because enough people believe it to have value. The belief strengthens each time prices increase and new waves of buying occur.
TA works. Until it doesnt. Always looking for patterns....

@_date: 2013-04-12 14:19:41
When the price hit $266 and the price started dropping, how did all those sellers access the market? The lag times prevented anyone from knowing the real price. Sure some folks panicked. Thats always what happens. But I cant get this lingering suspicion out of my head that the heavy hitters were allowed access to the markets while the end consumers was essentially locked out. Big boys sold all the way down to say $200, while a few buy orders were allowed through, especially market orders, so buyers got filled way too high. Although Im sounding a bit CT over this, lets not forget, IT ABOUT YOUR MONEY BECOMING THEIR MONEY. Zero oversight. Zero accountability. A true libtards fantasy. And we pay for it.

You are 100% wrong. The exchange itself was attacked yesterday. Remember all the $0.02 orders? The exchange failed, causing panic. Its quite a normal reaction, actually. People fear losing money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:12:44
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:02:06

Jesus this kinda whining is so pathetic. Grow a set. Traders love pussies cause they always freak at the slightest hint of change. Fear is your enemy.

Awesome news. Happy for ya. Im about to retire all my debt-paying off the house and the two cars, but its not due to BTC. My MIL died.

Why should anyone care about downvotes? Its kinda childish.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:04:30
Yes, however, do we know if MtG has been conducting itself in such a way? No. They could easily have been running an "exchange" to benefit themselves. For fucks sake, with no oversight, do you expect the foxes to spare the hens? Its freaking money! They want it all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:12
Just bot at $170.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:39:54
Im reading projections of $300 by April 15th. It could happen. Or the price could fall. Who knows. I bot my first coins today. Will buy more soon.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:34:42
Ask an attorney. Your answer will be "caveat emptur, bitch", which translates into: buyer beware. libtards love to spread pain. They are gleeful when little guys get fucked over by fraudulent exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:48:51
Prly right. Although the trend line from high to today looks like curent price is right on the "which way do I go" point. Might be healthy to hit $50 or $30.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:46:30
How can we say support is at $70? Price quotes are whack again. We continue to make lower highs and lower lows. $55 is the intraday low. We are lagging and trying to find support? Good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:22:07
Explanation: there is loads of money to be made by insiders during lags. They run the damn exchange. They can do as they please. Just like the bankers, its in broad daylight too.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:11:42
Specs arent running away. Its weak hands how are selling. Or its smart people who seek the exit. Who knows.

Thats right. DDOS claims are a distraction. Question: are there any laws governing bitfloor and other exchanges? Answer: NO. Conclusion: MtG and others have a license to steal.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:24:41
The whole entire mess was strated by the exchange. The exchange caused people to act. If you are cool with that kind of manipulation, fine.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:22:33
Why would you buy above the current price? Fuckin reddit...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:33
It means there really isnt a bid ask spead. Dont even try to trade it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:51:01
I respect your willingness to take risk. 
The way to look at Bitcoin investing is: the $ you are willing to put in a paper bag, take to your backyard and set on fire. Thats the amount you should invest in Bitcoin.
Yup, its a big gamble. Risk is either richly rewarded or it is punished severely. Know your own limits and pull the trigger. Or dont. Its that simple.
Me, Im interested. I think the sudden price jump is related to the Cypress stuff, so the price may cool down a bit soon. Then I may drop say $1,000 into Bitcoin. Again, not more than I willing to send up into flames, without losing my ass.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:44:41

So they fixed their problem with an upgrade, right? Oh, that was yesterday. The "lag" is just a shiny object diversion.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:58:40
LTC is moving in sympathy to BTC. It happens in the stock market all the time. Companies within the same industry can move up, or down, based on an outlook for just one of those companies. Also, folks who missed the huge move in BTC are looking to get in on LTE at this price, although this price is a giant move from recent prices.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:45:35
So do you believe you could go to the FBI about what happened yesterday? What scenario do you foresee where you would take legal recourse? Im really curious about this point. Thx.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:40:00
Thats not what happened yesterday. Their very own exchange caused the panic.

Along with the fear, the level of n00b here is astounding. Its like they want you to take their money. Its a perfect storm for those who are gaming the system.

Congrats on the snag. Another problem is that you get filled on the way down and the prices continues down far past your fill price.

Camp BX is trading at $80ish. Down $12 in 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:20:44
The exchanged was attacked, causing panic, resluting in the predictable outcome of driving down prices. Its been nearly impossible for 24 hours to know what the price is/should be. My exchange CampBX is at $100.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:26:09
Study human nature, especially regarding money. Humans have lots of hangups about money and the loss of it. The exchanges simply play into that fear response. If the exchanges were run like real entities, then people wouldnt panic.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:39:15
This comment should be required reading for ALL redditors. Its fucking money people. They want it. They will take it if it aint nailed down. Ive been saying this for days now and no one else seems to get it. Its freaking fraud.

This notion is really really dumb.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:22:51
If I werent so trusting, Id say these guys stole the money, folded the tent and took off. Lacking true transparency means we have no freaking clue what is happening with our money.

Sam wont need to do that. It isnt meant to succeed, if by success you mean widespread adoption. However, success could be defined as a very few making as much as possible off of a great many.

@_date: 2013-04-12 12:51:00
Dude, if an "official" of MtG is using something as asinine as reddit to post updates on his sites performance, we have entered an new paradigm of big balled brazen fraud. And if you believe him, you deserve what you get. In fact, you know about as much about this official as you know about MtG and the exchanges. Nothing.

Responsible for what? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:53:07
You will never sell at the high and you will never buy at the low.
As a former daytrader, I say you do not want to play this dangerous game. Buy some coins and enjoy the ride. Do not invest more than you can lose.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:31:40
Yes, the True Believers(tm) cant be fazed by price changes. Im convinced many of these buy and hold voices are plants. They are flipping coin like crazy but trying to get you to hold. Its a giant scheme and its working well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:51:17
Agreee with every point. Well said! Given the situation, you still buy/trade? even with all the potential/real problems?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:30:51
What horseshit. Just another brain dead survivalist CT er. Expect BTC to draw them out of the cesspools they live in. If you take advice, any advice, from the likes of this fuckstick, you deserve what you get.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:36:10
Whats interesting is that there were large numbers of people wanting cheaper prices when we were at $266. Now, we are 1/4 that and no one is buying. Why? Most people cant buy because the exchanges arent working.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:49:18

As an ex-daytrader, I can testify to the truthfulness of this statement.

@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:43
Well, I dont enjoy seeing others suffer. Thats sociopathic. When dealing with money, people have some really weird emotions. Like being completely oblivious to the fraud being commited by exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:24:29
If I understand correctly, the cash deposit option is using your existing bank account, then the $ is wired. Thats great, except I dont want to do the transaction in my bank account. Im using the WIRE option.

Making a profit is not a loss. Possible future price increases are not current profits.

Waiting for the True Believers (tm) to post the gold drop is evidence that money is flowing into BTC. HA!
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:23:24
Preach it. Absolutely.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:41:13
Agreed. Unless there is an outside force that acts to negate BTC's demand. Maybe something we havent even thought of.

@_date: 2013-04-08 13:37:26
Anyone with a lick of sense would, of course, layer their sell orders. A 1M coin order in any market would have negative effect on the seller.
Depending on my cost basis, I would sell some coins at $186. Id would have been selling all the way up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:34:34
Im getting a $118 x 124 quote from Camp BX. Through all of the mess during the last 24 hours, they have held up pretty well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:00:37
Yeah. Dont blame the bankers for tanking the world economy and stealing trillions of dollars. Its just in their nature.
If you can not grasp the fact that the exchanges failed due to poor planning against effective attacks, thereby causing panic in the BTC community, then you have drunk way too much kool-aid. What we are witnessing is flat out hyper capitalism in action. They will take your money because they believe it is rightfully theirs. The exchange caused the sell off. Seller werent lined up at $266.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:00:58
$218 tape on MtG. Down $48 from the all time high. Nearing a 20% correction. All you studs who claimed to want lower prices should be all over this, right?

A completely unregulated ~~and volatile~~ fraudulent market. FIFY
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:41:57
The facts differ from you assertions. The price rocketed up and some selling occurred. The MtG exchange began to lag. Some people panicked. Its normal. The folks running the exchanges know this. Exchanges were essentially inaccessable, but selling continued. Hmmmm...the exchanges caused the panic. Hence, MtG is at fault. BTW: MtG is robbing folks blind with this cute little game about lag times. Free advice... Its a diversion. We cant watch the people running the exchanges. Want to know why? Because there are no laws, no regs, no oversight at all. And we wonder why we're losing money? I am floored by the number of people who refuse to accept that BTC is a scheme.

They earn very small transaction frees from trades. The real money is to be made through manipulation, like when markets lag. They get to see all the freaking orders. They can front run. They can short. They can delay and fill market orders. The opportunities are almost endless.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:51:46
Your question reveals you know very little. Im not criticizing. Im telling you trading BTC is not easy. If you want to fail, by all means rush ahead. You dont even know the current price. $122 is pegged at MtG because the site is down. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:19:43
Thanks for the post. Im not one to care whether BTC is adopted as a currency. It so, great. Im in it for the pure speculation aspect, not for any sort of ideological reasons. My hope is that the price rises significantly from this point, after a nice drop, PRIOR to any of the bad thing you describe, providing all a chance to get out with large $ holdings.
