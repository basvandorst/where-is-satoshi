One turn turn on the phone miners!

TLDR?? Holy Shit

If you lose your phone. You have the written down back up codes. 
You use that on a new device to gain access back to your google account. 
Yes, for all accounts connected you’d have to have them send your confirmation for a new number via support in most cases or else can’t sign in. Unless the site has an option for email too. 
Other than that you’re fooked.

I will never understand why all these stupid people don’t just use Coinbase or paxful. Most of all others are a scam. Virwox if anything.!
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:48:00
Np. Lost my Coinbase once cause of a car accident and new phone. Had to send a voicemail to prove it was me.. :/ at least I got my account back but I was unhappy that Authenticator didn’t carry over even with the backup code
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:25:21
Yeah. Exactly. 
I put in $300 and now I’m at $490~ around this time. I hope it keeps climbing so I can get at least $700-$1k maybe even more!

Who the fuck does taxes for just a few hundred bucks lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:54:41
To have gotten this spam you fucked yourself beforehand so it’s on the user... 
Just don’t be stupid and know what you’re doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:02:08
Doing just some quick research on the services you want to use and their history. The good and bad... so yes for me, it would be my fault if I continued to use a service with hacked email lists, etc... 
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:04:15
Shit I’d keep that money so once everything settles you’re rich as fucking balls 
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:14:08
Some would do their taxes on those $2 too! HA!
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:27:52
No one would own that unreliable piece of shit car unless they’re retarded 
@_date: 2018-06-07 00:12:31
Why can’t I save this? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:22:42
I was hoping for $1-2m and hour. Is that possible? 
I also just can’t stand the kids that kill you or mess around with you for no reason. How do you do those exporting missions without always getting killed. I play on a free aim server and still everyone goes around for each other for no reason.

I already am level 140 but with barely $600k and a couple cars. I wanna restart a new character cause it seems to be impossible to do a single thing right now on my current character. Deleted my only group of friends cause one day went their full rascist mode cause they had family over. So starting fresh seems the best thing to do but if there’s a way to keep my normal one that’d be awesome 
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:40:16
Yeah true I don’t mind the grind. I love grinding it out on games but I do like being rewarded with good income or experience. 
Ahhh you got me there. I guess I’m the type that doesn’t like that it alerts others. I like being in a full immersive lobby but I just don’t like when it’s outta nowhere when you get shot up. I like livestream lobbies cause everyone is on the same page doing what they want without worry unless both come to an agreement they’ll fight it out. I at least with people weren’t toxic in game chat so you could just ask them to stop or if it’s fine and everyone got along. Have completed single player. I find it boring after not having any more main missions 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:10:36
I’m on PS4 
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:44:40
Is it possible to start fresh and rack up levels and cash online  without friends or buying any micro transactions from them? 
I have no friends and would like to play this game without paying hundreds of dollars for two or three items. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:29:17
I wish there was modding on PS4
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:18:56
Look at mr. money bags over here with auto cruise control

Look at mr. money bags with steering volume controls 
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:21:17
Oh I can only imagine the underlying problems all expensive af cars get. They’re are never reliable mechanically for a long time
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:29:09
Cause they have great weed

I can’t give away what I owe
