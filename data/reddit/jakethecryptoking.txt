You may be in the top 10% of IQ nationwide. But institutional money is hands down in the top 15% from an IQ and fiscal analysis point of view. This means that as a blanket statement it applies to 85% of people. You may be an outlier.

I am hopeful with you! However, I do believe institutional money is like whales on plankton. As they get involved the plankton need to prey for regulations or they'll get swallowed (assuming weak hands).

You should always have funds on the side ready to buy up alts during dips!

I appreciate it! The 50-Day Moving analysis is trailing BTC through the entire past year. I'd be surprised if we weren't back at 20k, with alts correcting as well within the month.

*** Corrected this. You are right, I misspoke. ***

Check them out in my daily posts :), I don't think it'll let me post them in the BTC channel.

The institutional investors did not make enough in month 1 for life. They will play games with this unregulated market because their alternative is the regulated stock and options markets. How they manipulate it is yet TBD. I have a feeling there will be huge crashes (last week) with also big pumps. In options you do not get rich with a stagnant price, it must move, up or down. IMO they will continue playing this game until regulation is implemented.

Completely agree and I should have used the proper term. I was using them interchangeably and they are vastly different.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:59:27
Agreed, but I do see BTC breaking 20k and heading toward $30k leading up to the Dallas Super Conference (February), and Token Summit in March.

Happy to help!

Thank you!

The majority are thinking crash...but I like to fade the public!

I've been telling everyone to get in on the NXT airdrop via Bittrex for the last 3 days and Bittrex finally came out and said traders wouldn't even have to remove their coins from the platform to receive the IGNIS airdrop. The futures of IGNIS can be googled, and are trading at $2.20. With NXT trading at $1.10 the value of the airdrop is literally equivalent to the value of the underlying asset (NXT). If you spend $1000 on NXT today, during the airdrop at the end of the week you will receive $1000 in IGNIS.
The math on that: 2 NXT costs $2.20. The value of the IGNIS is $2.20 so literally in 1 week all holders of NXT at current prices receive a 100% bonus, airdrop, profit, whatever you wish to call it. Because of this I expect NXT to continue to appreciate in the 7 days leading up to the airdrop reaching $2.00 by tomorrow evening and $3-$4 by the time of the airdrop. At $4 the value of the airdrop would still be over 25% of the underlying asset. The price of NXT could hit $8 this week because that would place the airdrop at a value of approximately 12%. Get in on NXT as quickly as you can before it moons.
I do own NXT as I believe every word of what I just stated. I am stating my strategy, I am not providing investment advice. I wish you all the best and hope we can all capitalize on NXT appreciating to where it's airdrop is valued at between 12-25%, a climb for NXT of over 400% this week. The more people that realize the ease of not moving coins from Bittrex and the size of the airdrop, the higher the price will climb.

Real businesses implementing blockchain tech!
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:30:59
That is because they have been taught well. HODL! Let the whales play. The BTC HOLDERS have cojones now!

Fantastic title, when BTC is back at $20k time for a Lambo and a Jet :).
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:30:31
Very excited for this! :)
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:53:15
Love this!

Going to $50k+ because of automated machine to machine transactions and arbitrage opportunities! Great read

I was reading about this, mining in the Permafrost is very cheap for cooling!

Interesting...could be a hidden reason for BTC's movements this week.

As have I. This will be a very exciting second half of 2018.
@_date: 2018-07-23 09:49:39
100% agreed but mainstream media would have you believe otherwise.
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:13:17
Thank you!

I am predicting between $15,000 and $20,000 with a ETF push possibly bumping that 
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:38:11
Thinking that will be a good hold by the end of the year!
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:19:27
It seems BTC like most assets will continue to appreciate!
