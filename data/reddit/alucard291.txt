Leaving aside a very legitimate argument that something that isn't used as money isn't in fact any kind of money - good or bad...
Crypto in general isn't "good money". It is basically fiat but with no safeguards and guarantees.
It also has an added disadvantages of being cumbersome, inefficient and inconvenient.
Or in other words, it takes worst things from both gold and fiat.
@_date: 2019-03-20 17:47:26
I'm not gonna lie. I'm bored of this conversation to death, so I'm just going to respond to the worst parts of the stuff you posted:


About the same. And if your network is actually getting any activity it will take roughly as long.


Nothing to do with familiarity. Everything to do with zero adoption. There is no adoption of shitcoins until things are priced in them.


Why's that? 
Besides fiat is sufficiently digital and significantly better than any creepto you can name.


Like you can copy bitcoin.


That would be because nobody needs decentralised money. That said this "nobody" excludes the usual suspects. Pedos, nazis, drug rings, slavery rings. You know the people who actually DO need it to continue being vile cunts.


It was not a first pyramid scheme. There were many others before it.


That tends to go away the moment you grow up. I'm quite happy for the existence of laws, police etc because by and large they work for my benefit.


Well yes scams tend to be very very long lived. And with a much much larger pool of greater fools creepto can go on much much longer than MMM and similar "projects" before it.


Currently the amount of people/businesses pricing anything in crypto is a number which is very very close to zero. There is no network effect.
@_date: 2019-03-20 18:15:20


I call a courier. He picks it up. Zero effort. It's insured so safety isn't an issue either.
Bitcoin? Fat finger the address and it's gone. Forever.


There's yet to be any evidence of value creation in this space.


Yes, one without pyramid scammers.

Well given the 6 or so years prior, there's not going to be any adoption of blockchain, let alone crypto.
There was some vague interest during the peak because it looked like one could earn some quick cash, but that's obviously over.
So yes in the rapidly changing world there's literally no interest in this technology.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:54:43
Yup because its insecure as fuck.

Oh so now I'm greedy? Brilliant keep them insults coming!
What you don't seem to understand is that blockchain is no different from any database in that if you feed shit into it, you get shit results. An unchangeable database doesn't make voting more honest. Won't make corrupt PEOPLE stop taking kickbacks for entering incorrect data into the system. Only difference is that once the data is in the system, it's there forever, it's immutable.
You literally have no clue do you? You're asking me how it's inefficient? Currently btc alone eats up 2.5% of the world's electricity and billions of gigabytes of space on idiots' hdds just to support this database recording some transactions... it's slow, it doesn't scale... It's shitawful for security - every user/hodler has to have multiple stages of security, which aren't free I might add (so it shifts the costs to the end users from banks lol), to even approach the levels of security we currently expect to have for free.
That last paragraph is straight up batshit btw. Shitcoins will bring balance to the ~~force~~ world huh? You mean in the same way that bitcoin is currently evenly distributed right? (1600 accounts hold 90% of it)
Please stop, this shit is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:57:17

That some non scarce, inefficient, incorrectable and insecure shitcoin is a good replacement* for something we already have?

@_date: 2018-06-18 14:49:13
Since you're not the usual 6 week old account-shill (which is SO REFRESHING by the way), lets discuss!
My general arguments for crypto essentially equating to a bog standard ponzi scheme (except on a larger, more international scale) are the fairly usual ones but they do as a rule check out.
It promises amazing returns, despite showing next to no progress in the stated goals. (Hell at the moment the progress is negative as most people are starting to realise that blockchain due to it's own nature doesn't scale).
The time scale for the said returns is always "10 years away".
There's a LOT of "just put money in please and leave it be". Even you just did it. By the way I did put money in, and I DID cash it out just before ATH (well you know you can't guess them all).
It is sold on the premise of faith - hell there was a guy proudly indoctrinating his 10 year autistic niece into this religion the other day!
It relies entirely on "the bigger fool" to keep its value. As in it constantly requires an influx of new money (which is currently drying up as is evidenced by price and liquidity), while all of the old hands are basically selling off at every opportunity as they try to cash out their gains/minimise their losses.
The aggressiveness of marketing deserves a special mention too! Look at all the 3 month old accounts, shilling shilling shilling. They will tell you that you'll be left behind, that you won't succeed if you don't buy in etc etc etc. 
Also people who invested in crypto are not homogeneous, some of them are indeed morons who bought in at ATH because of the above ponzi pressures. Some of them simply got lucky and timed it right. Some still believe that something without any scarcity and without any real reason for existence (I'm sorry but there is NO future to blockchain tech) will bring them meeeellions. Some are playing the market... Its not really so simple.
Aside from all that, there's a VERY big reason why a monetary system NEEDS to be inflationary. It stops people sitting on money (deflation literally means that not spending money earns you value - which is terrible as it kills off investment, growth and circulation). Even though $60 (AUD? - I doubt a pack of ciggies costs that much but yeah hyperbole, I get it) now isn't the same as in your father's time, I'd like to point out that you right now have (and expect) a SIGNIFICANTLY higher standard of living than he did at the time.

@_date: 2018-06-18 08:24:49
I'm not sure i understand. Have you actually got one of those silly crypto credit cards or are you just saying that you used the money you made by selling off crypto assets?
I'm the first case, you're not using crypto. The transaction is entirely in a real currency of your country. The processor simply takes the conversion off your hands (and very likely charges you a nice fee for it).
In the second case (i.e. if you simply made a quick buck on crypto)... Well what can I say, you made a quick buck off a ponzi scheme. Good on you. You did it at expense of morons who bought at ATH. Good on you I guess, you indirectly defrauded some desperate people
P.S. I already use a digital currency. It's called the pound. Haven't held a note or coin in months. But naturally your chosen shitcoin is much better than that because of reasons none of you can actually list. I'm guessing it's because its slower, more expensive and requires me to have bank level security measures at my own home just to match the security and protections I'm habitually used to.

Oh boy he leads with an accusation of childishness when his own argument is basically that of a 16 year old. But alright, I'll indulge you. I'm also not in crypto sorry. Well aside from a few flutters i made last year. (They worked well enough for me).
I'm most definitely not on anyone's side though. Especially not your so called "good guys" (darknet, ico scammers and shills).
Do you actually know anything about blockchain? Do you know that it's nothing more than an inefficient database? Ofc you do, you wouldn't be here with these desperate shilling attempts if you didn't realise that your bags aren't worth shit.
How will a database fix inequality? All that has happened so far is that most of crypto is in whale bags and is once again owned by the rich, the powerful, "the system" if you like.
So by supporting it, you are supporting the system.
Anyway, I'm bored. Ciao

You mean because traditional banks are insured against fraud AND are required by law to run checks on suspicious transactions?

Oh this is SO CUTE!
So the putinbots now want to organise a bank run. And some gullible (aka useful) idiots support it.
The general notion is of course that on the off chance that this does happen is that the money is insured or some shit.
Ok lets take a reality check here. Yes, some money is indeed insured, yes the\* nominal amounts for the average person will stay roughly the same, however what do you guys think this money will be worth if (big if) there is a real bank run?
And naturally very few rich people have money in actual cash.
So all that will likely happen is a further collapse of wealth of\* the poor people in Europe.
Then again, in a way I support all of this because if these guys are stupid enough to fuck themselves up, they deserve everything that's coming to them.
Just like over here, the North wants brexit? The north is likely to get hit the worst by the economic collapse post brexit. I'm good with that. They voted for it.

Oh don't worry low paid jobs are going to remain low paid. That's because the bar for entry into those jobs is nil. The only difference is that we are likely to "liberalise" labour laws post brexit and that will likely get rid of all the cute notions like living wage and the rest of it. Might keep minimum wage at 5 quid. Cos why not.


That's correct. There are also discussions about cancelling brexit, a no deal brexit, TM's deal on brexit, and many more things. Our government is clueless as to what they should do but they will forge on off the cliff anyway. So as I was saying, shit's uncertain yo. Bad for business.


China was just one example of a location where investors into our housing market come from. The chinese aren't even the biggest iirc. 


You got figures for that? Or is that... as they say... surmised?


Certainly, its full of cheap labour which we will gladly import as our economy frankly cannot function without cheap immigrants to leech off. How else are the northern gammons gonna keep claiming their dole?


Why would that be? Or is that you "hoping" again? Because together with liberalised labour laws and lack of externally enforced regulations - this country will see the levels of inequality that even the yanks never dreamed of achieving.


They are also lobbied by very very rich people who for example support brexit, as it stands to benefit them immensely (at your expense). Also you might notice that currently, the government thinks that brexit is a wondeful idea. It just so happens that I disagree and think the opposite. Unlike you it seems. So yeah, nice of you to fall for the agenda of the ultra rich.


Quite. Except you're about to fail GCSE business studies let alone a-level econ.
@_date: 2019-01-09 09:02:39
Sounds great so let's have some more inflation and let's get rid of some of em labour laws! That'll help!
So as I said, the benefit scrounging North will get shafted. But that's what they voted for. So it's all good.
I do like that you mention two of the most corrupt countries who benefitted massively from cheap lending facilitated by the euro and are now both learning what "paying money back" means (first time in Greek history I'd wager).

Ah yes the 1 doge is 1 doge argument. Although if you were paying attention the pound went down in value. Our inflation went up a notch, and so did the interest rates.


Yes, for the British CEO, however it is much cheaper for the Chinese Investors to simply buy up our housing market at it's root. Keep building them houses... so that chinese can snap 'em up on the cheap.


Ah yes, school level economics. The key word in that whole phrase is "hopefully". Keep on hopin' buddy.






Because weak pound, service regulations for trade between our biggest trading partner and uncertainty are fucking shitawful for business.


Or they could (and will) just offshore the jobs. Alternatively we can import more cheap labour from the commonwealth. I'd like that - actually, Eastern Europeans are getting a bit expensive these days.


That doesn't really follow your own logic - isn't 1 pound still 1 pound?

Of course the sad part about your perspective is that you "believe". Like you know "have faith".


Which found no traction outside of darknet.


Does not need or can not? Don't forget that bitcoin (and all other coinzzz) is classified as an asset. Subject to cgt and so on. This classification is unlikely to change in the foreseeable. And while that's the case noone sane will ever use it as currency.


Given 10 years worth of data showing practically no interest (until the bubble when a lot of normies got burnt), yes it certainly looks like adoption is coming and it will be total.


Hahahaha dude, what? No advertising? You lot here are doing what exactly? Or do you think advertising is posters and tv ads only?
