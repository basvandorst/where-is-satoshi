Too many people think of it as "that drug website" and not the fact that is does so much in risk reduction for those looking to experiment. Its worth a donation.

And bring the fees up right now? So you propose to raise the price of bitcoin by
1. Stopping new bitcoin being added to the market (stopping any chance of liquidity being an attainable goal).
2. Instantly raising the fee for transaction mining (generating bad press and causing those looking to adopt it as a form of payment to think twice).
3. Completely ruining the system designed to slowly introduce more bitcoin over time, to cause a short term growth.

Couldn't this end up trying the price of a Bitcoin to a barrel of oil in some people's minds?

You'd think they'd want to make a device people could actually figure out how to use

Do you ship to the US? Also, tell him to get checked out if he is a little septic.

Holy shit, that is insane

Right now, you have to use a virus-prone smartphone to scan a QR code with a wallet app.

Except that now there is more transactions to be processed in the same amount of time, with less miners. So yes, the miners will choose to up the fees.

There are groups of people who also agree the system is broken, and donate money towards candidates they believe in. Unless you're talking about a full-on revolution (and that will never be achieved through non-participation in the current system alone), you have to do it that way and work through the current system to change things. 
I'm not saying its easy by any means, but it is certainly not impossible. What is impossible is just deciding you're not going to participate and having that make any real difference, besides you quickly being jailed.

All candidates? Every single person? So if I run for Governor next cycle, I'm already serving them? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:20:50
What if this works, but we end up finding out the price isn't what was expected?
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:32:23
Why not?

I was really fishing for some more over-the-top answer to keep myself entertained :(

Doesn't this seem to rely on mass adoption of this device to operate?
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:50:56
All that does is make you not be involved with the system, it doesn't change the system.

Nah bro its cool, we hang and he told me he paid $800 a coin and is also the resurrection of Jesus

So not voting at all is a better option? People notice when you use a vote to make a statement. Bitching on the internet doesn't fix it. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:26:07
So, cut the incentive to mine (processing transactions), which will inevitably raise the transaction fee, and make a less secure blockchain?
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:06:17
Trezor is not safer than offline storage, what happens if you plug it into an infected USB port? USB is not secure.
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:05:30
Not correct, you can claim the system is broken and that is why you lost. But its better than just letting a broken system run without trying to change it.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:24:10
Don't vote? Are you serious?

The chinese mobile phones are also making a large quantity at once, which drastically lowers their BOM pricing. Look at price breaks on electronic components when you go from 1000 to 10000 units. A $50 wallet is impossible right now.

The uneducated ones are concerned with destroying the protocol in order to gain a temporary price spike to make quick cash.
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:06:01
Then how do you propose to fix it?
