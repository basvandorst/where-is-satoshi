Sell sell sell!
This is so stupid! I'm leaving, bye...

I would change if Bitstamp would confirm the ID I submitted for verification over a month ago.

What am I seeing here exactly? Sorry, new to this.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:18:10
Similar conditions, though. :p

Could you give some examples? I'm fairly new here and have only seen/used CB/GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:01:36
How do you do it by hand? I'm fairly new to GDAX, still working it out. Using CoinBase right now.

Is the Ledger Nano S better than the Trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:07:24
I've moved from using Coinbase to GDAX and starting to learn the slightly more advanced methods, but I'm trying to figure out, when I'm transferring funds into GDAX, do I have to do it through Coinbase and then into GDAX? I thought GDAX has lower fees, but if it's all going through Coinbase, am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:18:04
So what other exchanges are good? I've come through using GDAX, so don't really know any others too well.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:35:27
Thank you for that. Makes sense. :) So am I right in that I have to put money in through CoinBase and then move it to my GDAX wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:34:03
I don't get it. What, exactly, are they getting you to do? Is it a pyramid scheme of some sort? I invite others to the site who invites others, and so on?

I've never used a hardware wallet before. Does the nano s support multiple coins?

The only post you've ever made on a 2 day old account?
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:13:11
Same. It's a joke.

About time! I can finally uninstall Chrome! :)
