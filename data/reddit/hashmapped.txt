We all knew asiicboost was increasing the fees. Jihan and Roger has no power over Bitcoin now.
This chart is proof.

This is easily manipulated

When the reward drops 50% next year will you have made enough money back to buy twice the number of rigs again to stay even?

Except that dollars have no value and only use case is a representation of some other value. bitcoin cannot scale right now and will never be as scalable as a centralised system like visa or MC.
Bitcoin is more like gold than any currency.

Everyone so hungry to attack op here.
Long gone are the days of Andreas posting here and development discussion. Now it's just shitty memes.

After 6 years of having the nagging feeling in the back of my head, I've finally invested in a fire proof save.
Going on over a year ago i read the tragic story of u/Drwillpowers, and his/her house-fire scenario. This drilled deep into my nerves but as a regular human being I'm prone to procrastination, and the prospect of a fireproof safe seemed slip into the nether.
However, I've now made the $27 investment and I'm feeling a little lighter and more confident as I'm sure you can all relate.
Lastly, I hope you're all accumulating during this time... When there's blood on the street...
