It was mentioned on Criminal Minds last night too.

Absolutely!  Amagi had treated Silverbugs well.

So...you make a post about Dogecoin to complain about people making posts about Dogecoin.

Charts mean nothing. Can a chart predict if Amazon will announce they are going to start using Bitcoin, or if the a country will ban Bitcoin?

I'm in the same boat.  It's annoying and I really don't want to open a credit card just for this purpose.

As someone that is new to Bitcoin, I found this educational.

Nothing wrong with gold.  Silver will follow gold.  Gold goes up, so does silver.

I don't disagree, but one could argue silver is still at  a low and BTC is still  at a high.

Jmbullion.com accepts Bitcoin too.  Jmb along with provident are both great sites.

It's the only way to keep the rally going.  I added a little today too.

It takes a week, but the price you bought them at is locked in.

It's fine.  I did the same thing.  They need it to verify the account.  I just changed my password immediately after doing it.

His article is assuming that everyone is going to work with/accept every single crypto currency out there.  I see people sticking with Bitcoin and maybe Litecoin, rendering most others pointless. My point is, I don't see stores with signs that list 5 different crypto currencies they accept, but that sign will have Bitcoin.
