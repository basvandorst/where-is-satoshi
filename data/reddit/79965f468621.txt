I once sold 50 rotten apples just before they unrotted. Always hold.

Yes, and the way prices are spoken is Nam is a good argument against using "bits".
Because saying "two hundred thousand" is quite long, casual speakers just truncate it to "two hundred". So then in increasing order the sizes are thousand, hundred, million.
2,000 = "two thousand"
200,000 = "two hundred"
2,000,000 = "two million"
This is when they speak English and there may be a language barrier but lets not forget that bitcoin must be usable across languages.
Lesson: you can't just have "bits". You need spoken abbreviations for exponents of 10 that make sense, otherwise people will invent their own informal abbreviations and they will be extremely confusing.

Absolutely. This was the year of the first modern windows, "Windows 95". The OP treated it like it was 1980. 1995 is the fucking post-dos era for PCs. My high school had a computer lab. Hell, I got banned from the computer lab for stealing files and creating a student phone directory. My friends and I traded in porn downloaded from usenet. We had web browsers. We had Doom. BBSs were dying. AoL was growing. WTF, OP.

The good news is that bitcoin scales linearly O(n) after mass adoption. Initially it's O(n^2) or worse because each new user is a potential contact for every other user. There will likely be chaos for a while, but once it looks like it's going to work, it's going to work. The reason is that each user is essentially capped in the number of transactions they can handle, and transaction fees or other negative effects such latency provide reasons to keep microtransactions off the block chain. So if every user is averaging 15 transactions per day then that's O(n*15) = O(n). I think off-block-chain services will spring up to handle the transaction volume in the risk/convenience niche bound by the technical limits of bitcoin, and the blockchain will therefor operate at capacity.

Whatever it is, paypal is NOT money. It doesn't have the same properties money has had for ages. Bitcoin, however, has all the properties of money.
