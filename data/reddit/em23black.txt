this clearly shows how incompetent CampBX is!! if someone can hack CampBX so easily and get user email IDs... then, it is not difficult for hackers to steal all bitcoins from the platform one final day...

Difficult to believe that, its a fat finger trade, given that such a trade was executed during DDoS, when CampBX was not accessible... If such a fat finger order (market/limit) was placed earlier, it would have been executed earlier...
