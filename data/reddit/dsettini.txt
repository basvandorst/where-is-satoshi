I know Gemini is there, but it looks like (i'm not trying to shill or give advice here) Bread is attempting to be a decentralised type of coinbase. I have no idea how it will work out, but they have a nice brand/logo/product already. Hopefully they can give coinbase a run for their money.

Hi, I have a similar problem. I imported mine from cold storage to breadwallet, and the automatic fee they put was 49sat/byte. It has now been over 1 month and i've had zero confirmations. 
I've emailed bread 5 or 6 times and they are always very responsive and try to help out, but they said all i can do it wait. It's been a month though.
any ideas?

Lunar New Year in Asia. It's like their Christmas. Estimated 100 billion in spending. They are cashing out to live a little. This dip has occurred each of the past 3 years at the same time. 
Not a financial advisor or expert at all, but looking at past charts, this seems like the dipty dip to BTFD

i sent a transaction for 50 sat/byte which was the recommended, and it hasn't gotten a confirmation in 9 days. The mempool is clogged right now, and I only see it getting more clogged. That said, there's no way in hell i switch to bcash. With segwit and LN thing will get much better
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:44:27
can you re-import a paper wallet to breadwallet if the first import hasn't had any confirmations in 2 days?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:10:44
Is it possible to re-import a paper wallet into breadwallet if the first attempt had a low fee and isn't getting confirmations?

Hey guys, if you store btc on a paper wallet created with bitaddress.org, is that a segwit address? If not, are there paper wallets that do create segwit addresses? thx

I could see Roger Ver shorting bitcoin to then dump the rest of his.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:53
i've tried but can never get in.. thanks though
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:49
I was told to wait. It could be 2 weeks or a month. You can go to blockchain.info and type in your transaction ID and it'll show the status. So have had success using viabtc as a transaction accelerator. They only do 100 at the top of every hour though.. so you have to get lucky form what I understand. Chances are we're both just going to have to wait.

Well damn.. there goes my weekend. Got some SERIOUS reading to catch up on. THANKS!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:39:08
it's now been a week. I wrote breadwallet and they've been good an responding, but they said the safest way is to wait. But it's been an entire week
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:15
Does the difficulty adjustment have anything to do with bcash today?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:56
bcash just seems to gain more and more on btc.. so frustrating

When will another company come along with a similar user friendly, intuitive, and similar interface as coinbase to give them real competition? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:01:39
for people wanting to make some trades today and tomorrow, do you guys think it will be too congested to get anything done? I'm talking in terms of getting confirmations and such.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:59:34
mine was 50sat/byte

Won't people that are selling now for profit, to then jump back in after the fork, have to guess which of the two will come out on top? It seems like hodling or buying more now makes more sense than selling now and buying after the fork. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:34:05
How does the doom and gloom balance out when factoring in tens of thousands of new accounts per day on exchanges, increasingly intensified interest from institutions, introduction of futures with CME this quarter, and the likelihood of ETF's next year? That's not a rebuttal, it's a serious question.

@_date: 2017-11-06 02:18:44
A lot of people say it'll drop after the fork, but if people are supposedly going to dump their b2x for btc, wouldn't the btc spike and not drop? I mean I understand a lot will go back into the "discounted" alts.. but with how they've been performing, I think a lot of people will just put their b2x into their btc. Plus with both previous forks, I didn't see a dramatic drop off. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:30:14
The way I see it you can buy now at was is supposedly a high price and get both coins. Or you can buy a potential dip after the fork and then try to guess which one will win out. Looking at the past forks, the dip/correction following a fork was never that significant and it went up shortly after. I'm no expert and this isn't advice, but it seems logical to buy now if you're hodling long term. This way you know that you'll have which ever one wins out (likely BTC imo).

Thank you, but I never was interested in send partially from my paper wallet. I want to send the whole amount directly to gdax. Thanks for the links!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:13:39
According to most of the people/news I follow, b2x is bad for multiple reasons. Other than 80% of miners signaling, what is it about b2x that is so worrisome? If consensus is not determined by the miners, why would investors/public go to b2x over btc? Just because the transactions are little faster a cheaper in the short term? Is that really enough to shift the tides?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:29:06
From 240 to 70 was a while ago. The market is incredibly different even from just a year ago. I totally see what you're saying and it's totally possible. But those dips didn't have these other pressures that act against a colossal correction. Who knows. I mean if you want to use dotcom "logic", then also consider that the dotcom bubble bursted at $6 trillion+, bitcoin is at around 120b. I'm no expert, I really don't know much, but my research tells me to factor in all these variables for a long term perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:00:56
But why do we have to go through ANOTHER wallet? So just to confirm, there is no way to go from Paper Wallet to Gdax directly? Thanks guys for your help

at what price are you guys waiting for to get back/more in?

Hi, I used cointracking.info the other day. Imported everything and ran the tax report. However I noticed that I had trades where I sold coin "A" for Bitcoin and immediately bought Coin "B". It shows I had a gain on both though, one for $380 and the other for $300. Is this because I chose FIFO?
