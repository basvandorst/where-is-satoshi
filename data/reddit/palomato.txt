Historically, markets will fall when war is first declared. War is a risk--no one knows how it will turn out. People will pull money out of markets for security.
Prices recover, and ultimately wars highlight the importance of sound money. Think German hyperinflation after WW1, Hungary's hyperinflation after WW2, etc.

One of the first real-world examples of a sovereign attempting to use crypto to skirt sanctions.  If successful, expect other sanctioned countries to follow suit.

The Fed knows the US needs a new system in place before the government can default on its debt.

Probably filled a bunch of Stop Loss orders on its way down.  
Careful not to put your activation price for Stop Loss orders too close to the current price.

Powell recently announced no additional rate hikes by the fed in 2019. Today may already be the peak interest rates for the next several years, if there’s a downturn.

What a random example. Taxpayers aren’t a blank check excusing people from personal responsibility.

Don’t get hung up on the $500 number in this example, it is only meant to illustrate how the market moves without infusions of capital. It is true that Buyers can pump capital into a market to make it move up, but also Sellers can raise their asks creating a vacuum to pull it up, or both can simply believe the valuation is higher.  The reverse is true for moving a market down.
Massive infusions of capital are not required for price changes of any asset.

The price can move up without a massive infusion of capital.
To illustrate with an extreme example, imagine all of the buyers in a market are represented as one person, and all of the sellers are represented as one person.  The seller is willing to sell at $10K, and the buyer is willing to buy at $9,999.  A few trades happen at the $10K price level, but then news comes out causing both parties to believe the valuation should be higher.  The seller may raise his price (say to $10.5K) and the buyer may also (say to $10,499).  The next few trades happen at the $10.5K level.  Although only a handful of trades occurred, the price per bitcoin jumped $500—no massive infusion of capital necessary.
So the actual price of an asset is only what buyers and sellers value it at.  If the price per bitcoin were to go from $8K to $10K, it doesn’t necessarily mean $2K of additional capital per coin got added to the market.

Coinbase Pro did 46,300 BTC volume in the last 24hrs. 
Conservatively estimating maker/taker fees averaged 0.15% and $8500/BTC, that's $500K+ in revenue in a single day.

If $1.7T went into bitcoin, assuming bitcoin is still one chain, that's minimum $80k+ per coin
