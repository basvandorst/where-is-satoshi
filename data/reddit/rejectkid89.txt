Update [here](

do research..... Applepay is not stored on iCloud.  1 time tokens, numbers on cards aren't even visable during transactions.  Thumbprint required
iCloud wasn't even a breach really.  I understand brute force guessing shouldn't happen (and it's now fixed) but a widespread actual hack isn't there

not sure about where they pull from. :-(

still early on in yahoo adding this, so details limited. However I can confirm since this post mine hasn't either
EDIT: mine is now updating not sure on interval though
RE-EDIT: updating very regularly now

if you made 1mil/hr you should help me pay my 100k in student loan debt back :-)

Oh nice!  Thanks for extra info!
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:56:42
That would be great!  I have a feeling it'll take awhile if they are to do this.  The big name tech companies out there seem to be so slow on the bitcoin wagon :-(

go to stocks app, click hamburger menu icon in bottom right, and now each stock opetion has it's own hamburger icon next to it. click and drag that to wherever you want

You are correct. And I understand this. I just like to be able to swipe down at EOD to see how my junk did.
And naturally I can watch BTC(now) and Dow if I choose too.

UPDATE:  It is now updating very regularly (seems every minute).  And based on when it polls vs Bitcoin price trackers it would seem to correlate with Bitstamp's pricing.

For some reason apple dubs the iPad not worthy of their base app. But it would seem if you DL a stocks app with yahoo finance. Then you should be good. However then you don't get the notification center thing so it seems useless since there's others apps to get BtC price. Lol sorry :-(

2 things:
1. i like to read about it and see how it's doing
2. did a little bit of mining on an altcoin (that got me a nice chunk in the crypto world

Could you give us (or more like me) a guide on how you did?  I've been looking around and USD-&gt;BTC isn't as easy as I thought.  THanks!

how many fees were charged doing it that way?
