For a short amount of time yes. But assuming that the bank didn't make bad decisions and still has a positive net worth then people would get their money. They would just have to convert non-liquid assets to liquid assets in order to give back the money to their customers. 
But after that short hold everyone would still get the exact same amount of money back that they put in.

Thats different. Because banks normally have their money in non-liquid assets such as loans. The issue there isn't that there isn't value in what they have. The issue is that their value isn't instantly accessible. These assets are based on contracts and unless gross negligence has happened, should absolutely pan out. If one bank were to do it what they would do is likely put a hold on accounts, sell some assets, take a loan in order to keep other assets. 
With cryptocurrencies the "future value" is 1 of 2 things. 1) other people put money into the currency which raises the price or 2) it gets largely adopted and used for something making have some sort of usable value. However at this point 2) is pretty much just a hope because it doesn't really happen yet.

The entire crypto market is a Ponzi scheme in the *hope* that one of the coins will have long term value. people who are in now make gains when other people decide to put money into the market. This pumps the prices and people want to put more because of the insane gains. Then more people join in and throw in money which keeps pumping the prices. Its a market growing only because the base is growing and the amount of money going in is growing. Not because additional value is being created. 
What happens if everyone at the same time decides to pull their money? The entire market crashes. You might try to liken this to the stock market, but if everyone pulls out money from the stock market the companies still have intrinsic value such as property, products or services, brand names, and a market share to sell those products and services to. 
Now maybe you're agreeing with me in how ridiculous this is and you're going "Why the hell are people putting money into this?" And the simple answer is if you put in 3k 3 months ago you might be sitting at 30k right now. And that isn't rare. That's actually kind of common.

Thats true. Where as with Crypto currencies people would want to pull out their money in order to realize profits. Because the only way to use it is to sell it. Considering people are putting money into cryptos largely to make money, that scenario is pretty much going to happen at some point.  We've seen it happen in small portions like this previous small crash. But the larger the overall market gets without some sort of intrinsic value or underneath it the larger the crashes will be.
And realize I say this while also putting money into cryptos.

Or a speculative bubble...

Do not invest money you do not have. There is the large potential that you will lose it and will be left paying a credit card bill with nothing to show for it.

Giving a fallacy isn't enough. You also have to say why its wrong. Also it wasn't an appeal to authority.


The inverse, claiming someone isn't an authority, isnt an appeal to authority.
