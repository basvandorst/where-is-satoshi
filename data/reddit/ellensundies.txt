I read an article some years ago about 'the rise and fall of Bitcoin.' The cryptocurrency had made an unprecedented rise to $ 25 (not a typo, I meant twenty five) and had dropped back to like $9. 
I often think of that article. 
And of my father who advised me then not to waste my money on such a ridiculous thing. Thanks, Dad. 
Edit for spelling

God damn, really? I hadn't thought of investing with them.

Right. It got super high and crashed .... but from my perspective, it’s still way way higher than it was when I bought it.

Goddamnit. 
I’m only saying this because my father reads IBD. And when I was talking with him about bitcoin, years ago when it was $200 a coin, he encouraged me NOT to invest. So I did not buy anymore. 
Thanks, Dad.

Hang in there. And remember, there was a time when bitcoin’s value crashed from $25 down to $9.  It was “the end of bitcoin” everyone said. You can bet that everyone who sold during that crash is kicking themselves now. HODL, at least until it reaches the price you purchased it at.

What does this even mean? Is it a reference to the expense of a single coin these days? Ha ha ha ha I have a friend who bought some at $20.  I remember wondering if it was a good investment.   
Sigh.

I thought Microsoft was developing with the Ethereum Blockchain, not the Bitcoin one.  ???

They can only be used one place, and for one purpose, so they are really just an extremely limited type of scrip. They have a certain Similarity to Civil War Tokens.

Yea, I remember an article from years ago: “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin.” It had gone all the way up to $25 a coin and then fell back down to $9. What a ride!
