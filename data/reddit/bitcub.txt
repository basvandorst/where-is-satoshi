Thanks how to create a segwit address. Can I do it from blockchain.info. , sorry I dont have any idea.

Is it true, sending BTC from old BTC address will cost a lot. But sending to a segwit address is much cheaper? How much is the difference? I havent tried it yet.

I dont know if I am going to believe what other says: whats happening now is planned and drama. Hacked news,  BTC dumps,  etc are propaganda to make Bitcoin crash in favor of wall street whales late comers who wants to join crypto.  
Do I need to dump now or hold?

I wish Satoshi Nakamoto is present so he could file Cybersquating against Roger Ver for acquiring bitcoin dot com and twitter to promote his altcoin.

Hi,  what is the assurance that this is the right time to buy.  Some people predicted BTC to drop to 4k?
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:05:27
I sold at the 10k rate.. my USDT is ready, I'll buy a huge BTC when the chart hits the ass of Bart Simpson

SIr what if I only have 0.3BTC , will I get .03BCC ? What wallets can you recommend?
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:26:35
Lol, the guy at the back is the true hero!

I have a big concern regarding BIP148. Will Bitcoin dump big on August 1 or before? Do I need to do something or prepare something?
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:41:52
This is amazing, I wish the whole world would transact using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:52:14
Guys if I use Electrum will I get BCC along with my BTC in my balance?
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:36:58
Hi guys, am sure Bitcoin will dump before or during Aug 1 (BIP 148 / Legacy btc ) .
Is it safe to sell all my Bitcoin to buy USDT or ETH. Then rebuy the winning Bitcoin chain later?
