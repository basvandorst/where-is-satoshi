No, its that they could spend x at home or y while on vacation. Not sure how you see the money being worth less in the future when they get home. They aren't earning money in USD and converting it to Eur, they already have it and are converting to USD.
By your argument, no one would ever buy a car or new tech, because every day it get cheaper and more powerful. Its a wonderful thought exercise on economics, but its something not born out in reality.
Real world example. I make most of my income off of Cryptos and I am beta testing a visa that let's me spend btc at any POS anywhere that accepts visa, I spent 20$ at the store today, because I need food. Yes, I could have waited for btc/USD to come back up to 400$, then I could wait for 450$, and never eat again. See where your logic eats its own tail?

It goes to intent. If they had posted once with a less outrageous headline/title, then you would be correct.

Agreed, so much wrong with that logic that even with what I have posted, I have no chance of putting that crap back in the bottle.
If what they were saying was true, economies would have ceased to function thousands of years ago and people would be holding onto stores of salt and other spices because there value will be more in the future.
Its one thing to look for the best deal on a car, house, computer, cellphone, etc. But there is not one person not including rino that would stop buying essentials like food and hygiene items because they might be able to buy 2 rolls of tp in a week instead of 1 today.
No matter how deep a recession or depression, people still need to eat, wipe their ass, and shave. I have worked many facets of retail and can tell you this from the ground floor, even if there is a massive snow storm that has to close a store for a day or 2, that lost revenue will be made up when it opens up because everyone has basic needs that must be met.

While I agree with the basic tenants of your message, its akin to saying hey all you USD/EUR/CNY users, if you don't like scams, stop giving them a platform. There has always been and always will be those that try and get over on others for an easy profit, rather than working for it. Some of those schemes are legal and some are not. 
Bitcoin like the cash in your pocket requires people to be more diligent about every aspect of their financial well being. We have to remember that we live in a society where I can leave my credit card out on the sidewalk and then claim it was stolen and be reimbursed for every single purchase made minus the usual 50$ or whatever they say your responsible for. People are way to used to being coddled in every aspect of the financial lives, crypto is different, it requires one to be aware of their surroundings so to speak and if something seems to good to be true, it probably is, but sometimes greed blinds people to the things that others see clear as day.
What I am trying to say here? We will be more effective at preventing scammers from taking from newbs if we focus on educating people on how to recognize a scam and how to avoid them, rather than just standing up and yelling fire every time someone lights a match.
Those of us "old timers" that have been around since the egold days need to stand up and do our part to educate the newbs, but it won't be easy and most people will ignore us because they see $$$. I am considering starting a verification site for cloud mining operations, if anyone wants to chip in with some ideas or whatever please send me a pm, as I am not sure where else I am going with this post, I am signing off.

Right, but you also have to weigh that 20 versus the next 50 or 100 years. I would rather have a few years of suffering now and prosperity and health later, than faux prosperity now and suffering later. 
Just in my lifetime I have watched items like soda increase 50% and in some cases 100% or more. No one with any common sense can argue with a straight face that, that kind of inflation is good for a country and/or its people. 
In retrospect, I don't have much of an issue with the gm bailout, they tried and failed to find private financing, and the feds actually turned a profit on that investment. Its the Goldman Sachs, et al I have an issue with. Those were the people who made the mess, and we cleaned it up. They walked away with billions in profits while the taxpayer paid to clean house.

Another try at this. What I was referring to with the jewelry was the purchase of items they wouldn't of purchased at home because they couldn't necessarily afford it, but, they happened to be on vacation in a country with a more than favorable exchange rate to their own currency, so....
I can see how you would ignore and misinterpret this idea, because it argues against your view of deflationary economics. Economies with deflationary currencies tend to not have the boom and bust cycle the USA has seen over the past 80+ years. Before we dropped the gold standard USD was more deflationary than inflationary, and besides the 29 crash, our economy was pretty damn stable. It was only after 29 and the dropping of the gold standard that we started to see massive swings up and down.
My argument that actually agreed with yours was the following.
In a world where BTC is seen as equal to fiat currencies, and fiat still exists. I do not believe that BTC will become the 1 world currency.
An individual might choose 1 country over another because, heres a small economics lesson, Items are priced in the local currency, so thanks to lower costs to produce in said country, they would be cheaper in BTC. This would have a positive impact on that economy.

My "old fashioned" was the simple version for small amounts of funds. Not going to get into a tax/legal debate here, but on small amounts of funds, no one usually asks where the funds came from, as long your paying taxes, if your trying to stay in the law. If your not and your not paying taxes and your dealing strictly in cash, it doesn't matter and no one is gonna ask or care where the funds came from.
Your correct, using a business to launder large amounts of consistent income is the way its usually done. High cash businesses such as restaurants, laundromats and car washes are the typical fronts. And you don't have to borrow any money to buy one of those businesses, you can find a restaurant/bar owner looking to sell that will take cash pretty easy.

You are comparing apples and oranges.
First off, cex is priced at 0.0038 not 83. And petas price is as low as it is because people have sold off and pushed the price down. Cex is I believe being propped up by the guys behind the scenes, they have stated publicly that when they bring on new hardware they put it on the market in a way to create as little disruption as possible.
The maintenance fees are NOT that large of a deal for operations that aren't overcharging their customers, and neither is that big of a deal for home miners. Hashnest.com's current fee % is 32% while cex is 25%ish and peta is 75%.
There has been a lot of positive bitcoin news over the summer as well as growing interest in the financial sector, it is likely that we are close to the beginning of another bubble if/when this happens those fees will again go back to being near nothing. 
As for home miners, if your running your own gear and you have other income, you get to keep the bitcoin you mined and if the math works out, your turning electricity into btc and your better off when the price increases.
As for the clouds, hopefully cex/peta, etc are already looking to the next gen of hardware to replace their aging equipment, if/when they do this they can if they are willing, drop fees to keep themselves competitive.

It depends on how you look at it. Those of us with any sense don't see money laundering as a thing that exists anyway. But depending on how you look at it, me buying coins with cash and then selling them and ach'ing out to my bank account could be seen as laundering.
This discussion though is about breaking the connection between you and coins you use to purchase something online for various reasons. I still question why people use mixers when you can use exchanges that have much larger amounts of btc to mix with and you can completely sever the trail making near if not impossible to trace.
First step, signup at exchanges via tor or vpn.
Don't use your real name or address, make one up, they aren't going to verify that.
Second step, generate a deposit address for the first exchange. If your really paranoid, send a small amount to the first addy and then generate another one, repeat until your satisfied.
3rd step, Purchase another high volume stable priced coin with that btc, doge and ltc are good choices.
4th step, generate deposit address at second address for coin you bought from first. Again, if your paranoid, follow step 2.
5th step, sell the altcoin on the second exchange for btc, enjoy the fact that even if you bough that first btc with cash or credit card, that trail is now severed.

Not really a loophole, its the old fashioned way of laundering money.
Say I have 10k dirty cash I want to clean up and have harder to trace. I find something to purchase with that money and then someone else to sell it to thats not related to my source of said product. Doesn't matter what it is either, it could be watches or mattresses.

Your point is? Did you even read my post. I feel like you don't want to have a real discussion or debate as to the facts. You want me to agree with you and the op that josh is a scumbag and a blatant scammer, I can't do that, because the evidence doesn't point to that. The evidence I have gathered by participating at ht as well direct communication with someone who I believe was josh, it appears that his intention is good, but he is out of his depths, he has let a cult mentality fester on ht so you can't ask any questions if they aren't can I suck your cock.
As I previously posted, I went at josh hard asking questions that no one else would, this got me banned the first time, after that I got shadow banned by the downvote squad because they had a bug in the forum that gave people with high enough rep mod privileges. Do I think that forum and how its run is a joke, fuck yes. Do I believe josh is incapable of running an organization, fuck yes. Do I believe he is intentionally perpetrating an outright scam? No, I don't, I think his handling of people and his operations give off the impression that something is up when it is simply incompetence.
If you wish to provide real facts and info pertaining to whether or not its a scam or not, please provide so and I will keep discussing it, but if all you can do is yell fire, then I am done, if you look up my post history on btctalk you will find I already had this round and round and decided to stop and just see how things play out, me yelling about will change nothing, just as a million GAW is a scam posts won't stop the diehards, in fact all it will do is make them double down.

So you still believe that those that run a ponzi where as many people get paid out as possible, is worse than someone whos goal is to take in as much money as possible and bolt?
And yes, A ponzi is a ponzi, regardless of whether the runner is upfront about it or not. A ponzi scheme and a ponzi game are the exact same.
While I don't condone the running of a cloud mining ponzi, its actually a better choice from the owners perspective than actually buying hardware and running it. Look at the diff derivatives on havelock, Yes, they are upfront about the fact that there is no mining, BUT it is a ponzi, the funds being used for payouts came from the initial issuance of the derivative.
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:58:37
While I have been one of the few asking the hard questions of josh, and even got banned a few times because of it, you are clearly misinformed as to whats going on. Regardless of everything else right or wrong, the conversion from hashpoints to xpy happened over a week ago, the coin is live with people running the wallets in POS mode, I have withdrawn all of my coins from zencloud and they are sitting in my wallet on my pc as well as some at cryptsy waiting for the supposed 20+/piece so I can cash some/all out.
As for the argument being made that they will be manipulating the market. They have claimed to be providing a floor of 20$/xpy, how is this a bad thing? This is not the stock market, they are a corporation creating a coin and if what they say is to be believed, it makes sense that for big money to come on board they would want some stability in the price.
Again, someone please tell me how creating stability and a price floor for a coin is a bad thing? If a group of big BTC holders were to get together and "collude" to keep the downside to a minimum, this would be a good thing for bitcoin in the short and longterm.
Its very hard to make a simple ponzi/scam claim for gaw. They did sell zeus miners with their brand on them, so they did have access to hardware to backup the hashlets and primes, whether or not they had enough hardware to match every single one is a whole other matter. That might be why they are still charging 8c/day/mh when genesis and others are at 4c and below. That could also be why they let them get converted into stakers for xpy. 
If anyone questions whether I am a gaw shill or not, I didn't really want to connect this username to my real identity, but, here it goes. You can find me on btctalk under rdyoung, look through my post history about the source of their funds, you will also find where I posted some back and forth between josh and I. If anyone is interested, I saved them in a txt file and will gladly start a new thread on reddit with them. 
In short, I don't believe gaw to be an outright scam or ponzi, I believe josh is over his head in this industry, he made his money rolling out and selling wireless services in a part of the country where he had no competition, the internet is loaded with shitty reviews on their service. My thinking is he saw crypto and thought he toss a shitload of money at it and be a big player, but he doesn't know how to run a company, nor deal with the public.

We should NOT have bailed out anyone in the last "crash". All we did by printing more money is make the hurt go away for now, and if we can't fix it again next time, then it will really hurt. However, if we had let the economy crash, let us fall into a real depression, it would have woken the public up to a few things and 20 years down the road we would be stronger for it.

My issue is the lack of actual help. All I got in reply was an offer of 50$ to counter any fees I may encounter cashing them, as well as the equivalent of "our bad". 
No acknowledgement as to the details of the situation. To add insult to injury they offered to provide a wells fargo cashiers check the next time I withdrew IF I requested a MO. 
 
1) I requested a wire for a reason and to just send me a MO without contacting me is just bad business practice.
2) The MOs came with NO paperwork saying where they were from, as I have posted about the MO scams, that had me almost tear them up because I was not expecting them.
3) The website for the MO company states 500$ max face value yet mine are for more that each. Explain please.

Considering the cost is the same for new hardware as with older hardware, it doesn't matter if they bring on new hardware without reducing fees.
As I posted, the fees equal 25-30% of earnings, I am not in the mood to do the math again. So as I posted, we are further from that day than you think we are. With btc set to start an upward trend again, no one will be talking about fees until the next crash.
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:49:57
I will try and elaborate further.
Goldman Sachs and other companies lied to people to get them to invest in cdfs and other derivatives, they also put pressure on the banks providing the mortgages they were repacking to be more lenient in handing out mortgages, this led to people who had no business getting a mortgage, getting one that the banks knew they couldn't pay on for long. We know what happened from there.

Non us exchanges of course, but all in all 2 is enough. Once you have turned btc into x?x your trail is severed. You could also generate and use more than 1 deposit address at the second exchange and for the 1st if you feel like it.
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:48:38
Yeah, just depositing 1.234btc and then almost immediately withdrawing 1.234 - fee, would be an easily traced transaction. You could however space out your deposits to newly generated addresses for that exchange, let it sit for a few hours and then withdraw to a HD wallet, with mycelium or electrum you get a new address for receivables everytime the last one was used, so you can split up the withdrawals to several addresses and make it harder to trace, and then send them all in one transaction to their final destination.

Waiting to purchase a car or a house is one thing. 
However, people aren't going to wait to buy food, toilet paper, shaving cream, etc. If/when btc becomes more mainstream, it will be spent regardless of its conversion rate to a particular fiat currency. What will happen in your line of thinking though, some people will choose to vacation in a certain country because there btc will go further than in others, same as happens here. 
About 10 years ago, the USA had a boom in sales of jewelry bought by Europeans on vacation because they could buy more for USD than at home in euro.

I'm not sure you know what the standard definition of a ponzi scheme is. In truth, the us economy is a ponzi scheme. 
I am not participating in anything, I am looking to make a profit. Anyone who buys my xpy on an exchange is responsible for anything that happens after they buy it. I am not making anyone do anything. I spent a decent amount of money on the primes when they were cheap, made a decent profit before btc took a nosedive and ltc diff went past the moon, I chose to "mine" HP as a longterm bet.

Whats in progress is their "paybase", the coin was already launched with the grace of a 3 legged, one eyed cat, they had issues with the amount of hashpower thrown at and it went down for 2 days, then they had issues transitioning to POS. Obviously they believe money can fix everything, instead of looking to the altcoin community and getting the likes of the peercoin or reddcoin devs in on it. I wasn't in on PPCs launch, but I helped beta test the transition from POW to POSV for RDD and it went smooth as silk because they tested it on testnet first with the publics help. Apparently gaw thinks an inhouse team of developers can put as much stress on software as even a thousand testers worldwide.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:59:58
This is a viable choice, IF you can find a decently priced service that is legit and is likely to be around for the foreseeable future. You might also consider buying some hardware to run at home. You don't need to buy a ton of hashing power, but you can buy hashing power from 50c/ghs and cheaper these days. And during the winter, you have the added benefit of being a nice space heater.

No, they are different, there are different forces at work. With a stock you typically have a fixed supply, not counting for splits and buy backs. With btc we have a supply that is growing at 3600btc a day for the next 18ish months. Plus we have the difficulty which can slow down or increase the rate of supply on a 14 day average basis.
Tldr; stocks and bitcoin are like apples and oranges, close, but nothing alike.

Apparently quite a few if not most are not understanding your point. Those trying to justify the decline of other markets by bringing in the inflation are obviously grasping at straws. There are less than a handful of other investments that have done as well as btc in its short lifetime. 
Even if we discount the 1100 high because it was likely due to mtgox phantom trading and say that 300 give or take is the markets true value for btc, thats 1000s of % increase from only 4 or 5 years ago. Even in the time that I have gotten back into it, its up 300%++ since I was buying in sub 100.

Thats the point the op is making. When the sp500 or Dow is on a downtrend, that doesn't mean that the us economy will never be the same again. We can also say the same about the Nikkei or any other market around the world.
Let me ask you this. Do you really think that all of the investment in the infrastructure for bitcoin, in businesses, etc, along with the millions invested in mining farms will just stop or go away because btc had a "bad" 12 months? Let's also not forget that it was bad for the price only, not for adoption. Do I need to list all the big international companies that are accepting and investing in btc?
Let's forget about the day2day price of bitcoin and instead focus on adoption and usability. The price will happen when people don't even know they are using btc.
I am not sure of the chance of this happening, but, what do you think would happen to the price if someone in charge at western union woke up and realized that they could use btc to move money around the world for a fraction of what it currently costs them? This is the kind of thing that btc was created to address. This is when we will see the price hit the insane  that some of us believe it can hit, when people are transacting with btc but don't realize that's what they are doing.

While thats possible, it still requires someone to be running bitcoind to transmit that transaction to the network. And the in person credit card is not a good example, a better one would be before we had pos and the merchant took a carbon copy of the card to be charged at a later date.
Your obfuscating and ignoring my response to your question.
In short,YES you need a node running bitcoind to accept the p2sh SCRIPT and transmit to the network.  I say server because it makes more sense to trust a server with any type of script over a desktop.
Either your playing dumb, or your the one putting on a charade of knowledge. Its possible that you have a basic understanding of bitcoin, but lack the experience and technical knowledge that makes the internet function.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:15:24
Indeed, I am hesitant to rely on a script to do it in case the system its on fails for some reason. I know this can be overcome with redundancies, but personally I think that if you the funds to warrant it, you might be better off trusting a top tier law firm to handle things.
I have gone a different route and created a set of accounts that have mining income being into from my daily income, these accounts at the moment are setup for any future nieces/nephews I may have, when that day comes I will probably tell the parents about it and figure something else out for said funds.

Buffets advice is to be greedy when others are cautious and cautious when others are greedy. That said, if he understood crypto he would probably advise that this is going to end badly and short it if it was possible.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:21:05
Unless I am mistaken, you need the script or supporting software to spend from an x:y address, but the address is generated similarly to standard addresses. By this logic, all software is a script.

Mycelium has been out for quite sometime and I would argue its the easiest to use. Bitid is implemented in beta, not sure if its production yet, but it will be eventually.

Do you need to have bitcoind running to send a transaction? Could I make a payment to a local store if my phone/device was offline?
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:19:06
This is an awesome idea, though it would likely require new code, or the use of a coin that is programmed for this purpose. When I have the funds to do so, I will likely find a law firm that will know how to handle such things.

First off I would say you have no knowledge of the history of the USA or other fiat based economies. Second, you can't compare the fiat economies that have been around for thousands of years to something that is still technically a toddler. 
Crypto is bringing back the idea of having a stable and inflation free backing for an economy. Yes, right now BTC is technically inflating, but, with the next block halving and the one after that, we will move towards to a deflationary currency which by all means is healthier for an economy overall.
For the USA specifically, I would suggest you look up how much the average citizen had in savings before ww2 and then compare it to now. Inflationary currencies are great for consumer based economies, they are not so great for anyone trying to build wealth to retire with and maybe pass on to future generations. No, its not impossible, but it was easier to build true wealth when we had a gold standard than it is now.
TLDR: You need an education in the history of fiat and inflation based economies. NO currency lasts forever, and at some point in the not so distant future, the USD will have to change in some shape or form if it wants to stay alive. IMO The only reason why the USD is as strong as it is still, is because it has such a wide use worldwide. If enough no us citizens decided to move to something else, a local currency or a crypto, the dollar would lose strength.

No. Stock price for a publicly traded company is a reflection of what the market participants deem is the current value of said company. This is why you will see stock prices move up or down on news and rumor.

That's funny, I have been using bitcoin for 2+ years now and have yet to have any btc stolen. Maybe its because I know how to lockdown my phone and PC, maybe its because I don't download random files from email or the web. But, getting btc stolen is like getting cash in your house stolen, if you leave your doors and windows open, and advertise that you have funds to be taken, someone will take you up on it.

Not for long, every time garza posts, the price drops. LTC was actually something new and kinda different, xpy is just ridiculous in its implementation and long term "plan".

What??? Not sure what is so confusing about my posts, I figured it would be obvious, but I will explain.
I am hesitant to run a script on a server hosted by anyone, that includes myself, that is responsible for sending btc or any other crypto to an heir when I die. Why? Because shit happens, someone doing construction cuts off power or a fiber optic line, etc.
Obviously you have no idea what your talking about past the point of p2sh addresses are a script? They are script based, but if I am not mistaken its essentially a multisig x:y address. The script is only to automate the sending funds.
Again, if your looking to send funds to an heir after your death, it is probably smarter to trust a law firm with experience rather than trust a script to send the funds.
If your talking about other uses such as a script to initiate a payment to a specific address based on the outcome of a specific event, then yes, p2sh is perfect for that application.
Again: p2sh is a script that automates multisig payments under specified circumstances, p2sh is not a type of address.

While I appreciate your enthusiasm, your title and premise is misleading. Most of the sites you site, don't "use" btc at all. Google showing btc/USD? Really, that's them using btc? Wikipedia informally takes it for donations, its not on the giant popup asking for donations. That's all I have time for now.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:25:26
I down voted and here's why...
A consistent and steady increase of value against fiat currencies is dependent on new money. Btc could see the price level off and stay somewhat steady and likely will as more businesses close the circle and are able to pay their suppliers and employees in btc. Note: I am not going to debate why anyone would want to get paid in btc.
In short, the market or other value of a good or service is dependent on several factors, it's not something that should be eli5'd

Then the interbank system there, is light years ahead of the USA. We are just now seeing same day ACH debits from accounts, noticed this with a new auto insurance policy recently, gave ACH details, expected several days, it was pulled same day.

Not sure your aware of what p2pool really is or what it offers. On average it's more profitable to mine with because its designed to be more efficient. This extra profit more than makes up for any of the negatives you think exist.
Edit: To add, that p2pool functions like other pools, you don't have to run a local instance if your hardware or bandwidth doesn't allow for it, you can connect to the closest public node to you and get paid directly to your btc address.

If nobody buys, then nobody is selling and there isn't a price at all. This is the preferred future, not needing to sell into fiat.

That doesn't teach the actual history of the US economy. If your basing your whole argument on what you have read on one website, there is no more need to debate because clearly you already have all the answers. And in the same vein, I can find out who the next president will be by asking the homeless guy on the corner, no way in hell he would ever be wrong or steer me in the wrong direction.

Exactly. While we all want to buy bitcoin at x and have it go to y, we have to realize that it will take time for the insane evaluations that I believe are possible down the road. If btc is successful, the average person won't know they are using it, when this happens values of 100k or  1mil/btc are definitely possible.
Those of us into crypto now are akin to the investors who took a chance on msft or google before they were big. We need to stop worrying about the price of bitcoin and focus on adoption, as adoption grows the price will surely follow.

While I do feel for the swarms of people who maxed out CCs to buy primes and hashlets and then converted them to stakers, all we can do is sit back and watch.
Its obvious that josh and whoever else is running gaw has no financial sense whatsoever. Assuming they were going to do what they said they would with XPY, simply setting a fixed buy price @ 20 on paybase would have almost immediately brought all other exchanges in line with that price, thanks to something called the "Law of one price". I was bored on NYE and decided to do battle with the cult and everyone kept posting rationalizations that no amount of money could battle the P&amp;Ds, thats where the LOOP comes into play.
Even the supposed big dog daytraders on there were rationalizing the about face on this. There were a few that understood this, but I would bet that they are shadowbanned as well.
What can we do about this? Sell any and all xpy your holding and watch it slide. Regardless of how many are locked up in stakers, even the most hardcore devotees like volder will eventually cashout when they see their millions disappearing because of joshes lack of knowledge and lies.

Considering that the usdollar was gold backed until the early 20th century, saying the $ has been going strong for 2+ centuries is disingenuous. If you look at the inflation rate of the $ before we dropped the gold standard we had as much deflation as inflation if not more, ie the $ was gaining value, now it loses value year after year.
Take a look at currencies from around the world and you will see that inflation is the death knell of currencies.

Correct, but they chose to keep production at par rather than slow it down. Why? Likely to try and reduce the USAs growing market share. And it doesn't hurt that is also affecting Russia

And let's not forget the service they provide that stops people from reversing transactions to sellers. They totally have the merchants back, they would never reverse a payment with overwhelming evidence in favor of the merchant

Wait!!! How is less than half of one percent a large amount? Thats less than cryptsy charges. Perhaps they could eventually move to a volume based fee, but as it stands, that is a reasonable fee for the back end needed to support the service.
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:55:09
How is it not relevant? And you still didn't tell me how half of one percent is a large fee for the backend and support to run the service that mycelium is offering?
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:29:30
OK so in short, your argument is A) they only compete with LBC rather than all avenues for people to acquire btc for cash. B) the fee is too high because some clients ask you to bypass the trader so they can avoid fees, sounds like a solid basis for fees being too high to me.
You clearly missed my saying that perhaps they could move to a volume based pricing structure, ie a market maker setup, charge the buyers but not the seller, this is an incentive for people to use it to sell.
You also clearly believe that a person or company shouldn't make a profit over running cost, this is the reason people attempt to bring their ideas to the masses, without it the economy would cease to function.
And no, I wasn't being a dick, you refused to answer my point so I kept asking until you did.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:08:13
Really? Do you mean like circle? Where they don't charge a fee, they charge you more per btc also known as a spread?
You still haven't told me how thats a large # for what they are offering. Are companies not allowed to make a profit anymore? Do they have to provide services at a loss because you don't want to pay?
