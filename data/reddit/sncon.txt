Any good reads that educate on why Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi scheme? I have a lot of family that thinks it is and I am unsure of how to explain that to them.

Most people have been moving toward buying a [Ledger Nano S]( This is a hardware wallet that stores your coins totally offline and tucked away safely into your home. 
Second, people have been advising to stay away from Coinbase with a decent amount. Sometimes, Coinbase/Gdax goes down due to a heavy load and for those periods of time you are not in control of your BTCs. I would definitely advise you to buy a hardware wallet!
And lastly, congrats! Smart move by your younger self.

There are other subreddits for this type of question, but basically you can buy an adapter "USB to SATA" Or whatever type of hard drive you have and you can plug it in to your computer. Or you can plug it directly into your motherboard. Anyways, once you get an adapter you boot up your computer and go to File Explorer and you'll see another hard drive pop up other thank your (C:) drive
