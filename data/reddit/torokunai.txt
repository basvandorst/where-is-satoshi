Money is life. The artificially-limited supply of money in the US economy in the 19th century allowed the already wealthy to acquire much more wealth on the cheap, like title to millions of acres of productive land via the railway act.
The key thing is credit/fiat must be used to construct wealth-creating capital, not just consumption or tulip acquisition.
The former is the path to happiness, the latter is crash city.

The housing crisis of 2007-2011 was caused by the newly deregulated private mortgage industry in 2003-2006 giving TRILLIONS in "suicide" loans to specuvestors and people who lacked any of 4Cs of credit and being able to sell these quite dodgy loans on to bagholder investors via improper credit ratings by the several ratings agencies.
What made the crash of 2008-2010 worse was the wider economy of 2002-2006 was being entirely juiced by the cash-out refis pushing up to $100B PER MONTH into the middle-class homeowner consumer economy (plus the wealth effect of rising home valuations making people more happy to spend $ even if they didn't "cash out" / borrow more then).

what caused the housing crisis was corporate-insider **control fraud** among mortgage originators, Wall Street investment houses, and the ratings agencies, not our monetary system. They knew what they were doing was wrong (unsustainable) but the profits were quite sufficient to do it anyway.
While I generally detest Austrianism as a rich-man's ideology, I do agree with the criticism that the current monetary environment is being abused to patch together a broken system.
Capital should be available to those who have productive needs for it, and fiat and/or fractional reserve lending (contrary to the FPP these are not the same thing) is a great way to facilitate that.
While it can be abused by politicians unwilling to enact unpopular tax policies, I trust democratic systems over he-who-has-the-gold-makes-the-rules systems.
