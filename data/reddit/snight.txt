That is true, but it is also a cop out. If Btc ever became totally worthless then it wouldn't need a price feed anymore. So, you're right. 0.0000 will never show up on a screen for Bitcoin, but that is true of any asset. Even bankrupt companies still trade above $0, even if only by a few cents before they get delisted (which is what would happen to bitcoin if no one wanted to buy it). BTC could become worthless, however, if no one wanted to buy it. Again, it (BTC) isn't a real thing.

Seeing as the main premise of your argument was " Every lost bitcoin just adds to its value like a donation." I think you're just falling back on this to save face, but hey, what do I know? I'm not a cryptocurrency founder, after-all.

If nobody in the entire world wanted to buy your bitcoin then the value of bitcoin would be 0. You also forget that bitcoin isn't a real thing, it is a concept, and as such it only has value so long as the idea (movement) behind it has value. If I have a piece of plastic, it might only be worth the raw materials that make the plastic, but with bitcoin there is no underlying "asset" - I.e. physical thing - that it represents, and therefore the only value that it holds is notional.

I don't think you understand how supply and demand works. If there is no demand it doesn't mean shit if there is less supply.

If nobody wants to buy bitcoin it won't matter whether there is 1 bitcoin or 1 billion bitcoin in the world.

And you know this how?

I think you need to re-evaluate the way you think about investing / crypto. Repeating the words of others does not make them true or you right.

Tell whoever wants to buy it that they get an x&amp; discount if they convert the money to bitcoin and complete the transaction that way

Ooh, lets put all of our money into this ethereal "crypto\-currency" with no tangible assets whatsoever to protect them from a crash \- yeah, sounds smart.

Bitcoin could be a fad. I have no doubt that there will be a successful crypto currency, or some iteration of it, but what makes you think it’ll be bitcoin?
