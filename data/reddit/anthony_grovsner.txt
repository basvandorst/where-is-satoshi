i appreciate this, but what about various alts?  With a Nano S you could easily have a Ripple wallet, Eth wallet, BCH wallet, BTC wallet, LTC wallet ... etc etc  how easy is it to recover alts?

paper wallets.

when i saw it on the news, I certainly thought (concerned) about people with paper wallets.

I would like breadwallet to offer a "duress" wallet, where you could either enter an alternate PIN or 12+1 seed words and it instantiates a pocket change wallet.

in theory ioS is *practically* as secure if you thrust the wallet.   I am facing a similar decision, and even though i "know" iOS is sandboxed i would find it difficult to have more than i would be prepared to lose.  At some point i will get a Trezor - see what Trezor 2.0 offers and see if the pricer reduces a bit ~10% of your total coin seems reasonable to start considering it? .... then as the price rises it makes it easier : )
When it comes down to it, it all depends what level of "cash" on your person starts to trigger freaking the fuck out.  some people it might be up to $3000 some might be ok with $300, personally $100 is my limit.
I like showing people breadwallet to try and get their interest, maybe offer to sell them $10.  Dont think i would want to be flashing more than double digits - not that i have much coin in total anyway.

where the link you gave me above says


how do you know if your offline / cold storage wallet is BIP148 or legacy trusting?
I guess the safest is just using the raw private key, but for convenience sake i also have a MultiBit (cant recall version) wallet files ... although i also exported the private key 'just in case'

interesting .... this is difficult to get head around.
Why would it be legitimate on BCH chain if the transaction was sent on electrum BTC servers (that are BTC blockchain) - sending from one electrum wallet to another electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:47:00
Thanks for the explanation, I had read - but not completely understood that their *may* be an issue if you are not careful about old wallets somehow becoming invalid somehow.  Perhaps I am mixing this up with BU / Hardfork (?)
Is there any thing the should be done with old cold storage wallets (like perhaps sending the funds to a new address) in the event that the describe UASF "persuasion" of SegWit happens?

just to let you know - I initiated a transfer from Coinbase at a similar time and after ~24 hour of "Pending" the transaction was broadcast on the blockchain and has a couple of confirmations.

what is his referencing?
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:51:45
just to be sure i understand
* On on July 30th I have Wallet called "PREFORK" containing 10BTC.
* On Aug the Xth (once fork have sucessfully happened) I purchased 1 BTC from Coinbase.  This 1 BTC is a "split bitcoin"
* I send my 1 BTC purchased to "PREFORK".  
PREFORK BALANCE =11 BTC
* I send the total balance 11BTC (minus fee) to new wallet called "POSTFORK"
* "POSTFORK" wallet now contains "split BTC"
* "PREFORK" wallet is now empty of (split) BTC
* load "PREFORK" private key / seed into BCH/BCC wallet that will contain 10 BTC.
*note to stalkers i have significantly less than 10 BTC but using 0.001 mbits complicates things : )*
@_date: 2017-07-31 09:33:27
Unrelated but related.
I have entertained the following idea regarding Bitcoin Cash / BCH:
I don't think it would be possible to do what Jihan has done over the last years without significant and serious input / funding / support from the Communist Party, I don't doubt he would HAVE to be very close to them NOW to be able to function.  This would mean that it is in the Party's interest for BCH to be as large a success as possible.  Perhaps that will mean that outside of a handful of outsiders BCH won't be adopted in the West, but i can see how (with the help of the party) BCH could be the adopted digital currency of the Chinese economy (why would the Chinese administration allow the alternate BTC to flourish?).
BU was an attempted takeover, the split is exactly that - a breakaway.
TL;DR we are in first currency war of the 21st Century.

@_date: 2017-07-29 22:00:02
My understanding is as following.
*in the case of having 1 BTC in electrum wallet on 31st July* .....
Post fork - *perhaps once everything has calmed down*, move (send) the 1BTC from your electrum to a new wallet (that has a different private key).  This will mean that your old wallet is "empty" and your new wallet will have 1 BTC that is received as a transaction on the BTC blockchain.
Next, export the private key from the old empty wallet and import it into a trusted BCH wallet (which will be trusted i don't know).  As this BCH fork of the blockchain will not include your 1BTC transaction (sending to new wallet), this wallet will have 1 BCH as balance.
*clearly importing a BTC with balance/funds wallet private key in BCH wallet software is not a sensible idea*
... someone correct me if i am wrong.
