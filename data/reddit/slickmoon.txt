The fee in a transaction is determined by the amount of data needing to be transferred. E.G having many inputs and outputs means you need to store a lot of characters. I've recently done a 1 input and 1 output transaction with segwit that was 100 or so bytes. Half of what I'd normally expect to see. 
With the fees as low as they are at the moment, it cost me almost nothing.

This [link]( was stickied last week by the mods that details some of the upcoming tech advancements for Bitcoin this year.

I don't know, I leaning more towards [hanlon's razor]( on this one.

My guess would be that Coinbase is designed not for market trading but rather like a foreign exchange platform. There's probably a larger element of risk in it as well for them.

It can sometimes mean that Bitcoin has grown too fast and is sucking value out of other altcoins. Once that happens I've never seen Bitcoin hold its gain.

There's a 485btc sell wall on gdax right now. Should be interesting when we get to it.

Unless you hold the private keys, you don't own the coins. Don't store all your Bitcoin on an exchange because you allows yourself to be potentially held to ransom like this. If you really have to, put it in a multisig so you can recover them.

Storage space, bandwidth, validation time. 
You could pick any of those but I'm sure when they built that road, they thought they had enough lanes. Scale will likely surpass [Moore's law]( by a considerable factor.

At 20million per coin you have about 6x more money in Bitcoin than the entire GDP of the world.

There is a lot of hype right now, nobody can really predict what's going to happen. 
Overvaluation is likely now due to the sudden rise. But crypto doesn't act like a standard commodity or stock, so this behaviour could be nothing strange. My guess is that the CME Bitcoin futures opening very soon probably has a big part of it as it will bring in tonnes of institutional money.

I'm not sure you have the right attitude here. Some people spend their entire life trying to live comfortably without having to work, worry about loans, insurance and the such. You've done the same in about a year, don't devalue what solving all those life problems means. 
Especially when you are in such a risky market. Don't make the mistake in thinking you have that money. As long as it's in the market you've got a couple of number that don't mean anything. And those numbers can easily go back to 0.

"only" 225? Are you missing a decimal? I'd be pretty happy to be a millionaire right now with that many coins.

If this is retroactive, does this mean Australian purchasers are entitled to refunds?

Bcash has such a small hashrate that it is trivial for any large pool to have more than 50% of the hashrate and rewrite the bcash transaction history.
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:22:18
And it can still be reversed in bcash.

Not that any of that is really relevant here. 
It's highly likely that any exchanges/purchasing platforms that operate in AUD (eg: Coinbase and Coinjar) are required by law to charge GST on purchases of crypto tokens by the Australian government. 
GST is not income tax, it's a VAT.
