edit: oh i see what you're saying
Yes, I already use coinbase and bitstamp. :) Withdrawing BTC from my mtgox account would have been good if I had a time machine :(

Why would a password reset be used to brute force people's account passwords? I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:30:49
As in, I've moved everything to my laptop (freshly formatted) that I do with bitcoins. The laptop does nothing else and is not actively connected to the internet. I've even done this with my email for my mtgox account.
OS: Windows/Mac, both kept up-to-date
Flash is also click-to-play.
I've done security work years back, I'm pretty comfortable with my ability to keep my computer secure.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:40:43
LOL, that means their webserver trusts a proxy-forwarded IP (X-Remote-Addr or something like that). Try putting a single-tick quote in that header field and see if it generates SQL errors or anything for added facepalm. Thanks to a [different security issue]( with their service I can't test it myself. ;)
This is a pretty serious security issue, yes. You should tell their staff right away.

Definitely blows man. I fucking hate their support as well.
Too bad there is pretty much no way to get MtGox's attention but to bitch on social media until they make a press release. There's no other way to contact them or their managers.
@_date: 2013-07-16 00:37:50
I've been told I do a good Mackey impression.
@_date: 2013-07-16 00:42:38
Or just use bitpay, like most merchants do, and you don't have to worry about a thing.
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:46:32
I asked mtgox, they said that someone did indeed log into the account other than my IP.
I tried to use the password reset code in my email. The "confirm" button on their page just reloaded the page and didn't do anything. Probably because someone else had already ran the code, or reset the account, or whatever.
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:45:42
Hey. Private message me your story. Have you posted anywhere else about it? Is your mtgox username obvious to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-07-14 21:04:08
I also had the [same problem]( and I've seen at least 10 other people who experienced it. It's not because we had shitty passwords, there's some security flaw with mtgox. Nobody read the password reset email I was sent but me.
I cannot get mtgox to even reply to me over their support, it's just awful. At one point they told me to just do a password reset in 24 hours, then they told me I would get an email, now they're just asking stupid questions like "what's the email you have on your account" and they haven't replied all day.
Get attention to this now! It's scaring the shit out of us. Even people with 2FA on their accounts have gotten them hijacked!
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:48:01
I do not have java installed on my system. Ethernet.
I have everything sandboxed.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:52:00
I didn't reuse my username, but it could be possible to figure it out if you dumpster dived through my comments and correlated it with a post I made on a forum somewhere, yatta yatta yatta.
Anyway, other people have been reporting this issue so I hope you can put aside our differences.
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:42:46
Java will never touch my web browser.
@_date: 2013-07-14 14:33:54
Yes, because the best idea would be helping account intruders find my mtgox username. This will surely keep me secure.

U.S. is world police, they'll probably raid burnside for securities fraud regardless of what country he lives in or where it operates from. U.S. law applies everywhere.

"Whitey is too frickin stupid to get it."
lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 99% of bitcoin users are white libertarian college students in urban areas.

I didn't exclusively trust MtGox, I have a lot more in other exchanges and in my BTC wallet. That said, the 200k is only in there because I couldn't withdraw any faster from them and they paused withdrawals for 2 weeks. I also didn't resume withdrawals again because some banks started closing people's accounts who wired to MtGox, and I needed to arrange a new bank account.
So all around, what a gigantic pile of shit.
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:40:46
what is this faggot shit?
@_date: 2013-07-14 13:48:16
Thank you so much for the link, I could not find that anyone else experienced this problem.
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:48:36
Well mtgox told me no withdrawals occured so I'm cautiously optimistic... I'm sorry if you lost any BTC that blows hardcore man...
@_date: 2013-07-14 20:29:12
That's why I said it...
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:41:53
Wait so they send me a password reset email and change my password... when someone tries to bruteforce my account?
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:06:13
MtGox hasn't replied to my support ticket in 24 hours. My account was hacked due to *their own* security problems, *not mine*. Someone is intercepting password reset emails as has been reported in the last few days by over a dozen people. In the best case scenario, their password reset system is completely flawed. In the worst case scenario almost any account with a known email or username can be hijacked. Or even worse if there's a rogue employee.
In fact, it wouldn't be a stretch to think mtgox themselves are playing a game to secure deposits from people's accounts if indeed there is a liquidity crisis.
I've talked to two people who have lost bitcoins from this issue.
I have over 200k USD in my account as well, so yeah I'm pretty god damn pissed.
What a completely incompetent support staff as well, none of them speak English and they evade almost every question. I don't trust these people at all.
@_date: 2013-07-15 17:40:21
Sorry, my account is new, but these troubles are legitimate. I didn't want to use my other account since someone could potentially figure out my mtgox username from it and I've had enough problems with account security there.
And according to MtGox nobody has withdrawn from my account and my limits are set to zero, it's just that they won't reply to my tickets. I can't get back into my account. A couple other posters haven't been as lucky and actually lost bitcoins and I feel for them.
And I'm bitching about my troubles here aggressively because historically that's the only thing that has ever gotten MtGox's attention.
Remember the last time they got hacked? They kept telling customers, "oh, well you must have messed up and used a bad password", "oh well I guess your computer got infected" meanwhile some SQL injector was siphoning off thousands of bitcoins from people's accounts. I know for a fact that my computer is not infected, my email was not accessed and my account was compromised due to some security problem on *their* end.
@_date: 2013-07-15 22:33:08
that poem sucked bad
but to be honest with you
mtgox really sucks
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:57:40
no lol
other people have pretty much demonstrated this is an epidemic with mtgox customers, I believe there has been some sort of security breach on their end.
@_date: 2013-07-23 00:36:36
Just got mine in the mail! Wish I would have ordered one of the custom background ones you just came out with.
The QR codes are small on the ones in the picture, my (Nexus 4) phone camera can't focus on them. :(
