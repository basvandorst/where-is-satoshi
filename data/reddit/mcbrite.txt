I understand SegWit, what it does and what features it's needed for.
Did not really understand your last paragraph/2 sentences?

mbtc would make the most sense... Great for every day use and 1000 of them is always a bitcoin, so there is only upside in my view...

This is filled with half-truths and does not attempt to answer the question?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:03:45
Thanks for that, food for thought!
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:37:24
Sorry, but that's just parroting without adding any facts... No use to me at all... I can read stuff like that all over the internet... And unfortunately I do... Way to much...
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:24:05
??? The fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:08:12
1. YOU said scaling is 100% doable with the second Layer... My point was: How? How will you fit even more, "real", normal transactions in the Blockchain while keeping it Legacy? 1MB is 1 MB... SegWit already strips all but the tx, so how is that supposed to work? And if it DOES: Why the fuck have the Blockchain at all? THAT was my point...
3. Kind of hard to film that, since current browsers start caching the download as soon as you click the link and before you chose where to save it to... :D Even then, could I not just speed up the footage? :-D But if you're feeling generous ;)

Yes! That's the exact problem! 95%+ of people everywhere just parrot what they heard "their favorite" mention about future of BTC, without even understanding the first thing about it...
Reminds me of the entrenched, retarded opinions of Democrats/Liberals AND Republicans/Conservatives... No thinking, just shouting over each other...

Thank you! My reply:
1. I know it roughly doubles it... But like I said: What do we do in 1 or 2 years, when it's full again? With bitcoin exploding, that's merely a bandaid and fixes nothing, really?
2. I watched some presentation where somebody said, that currently a transaction reaches 98% of hash power (as in the biggest, most important pools and miners) in about 2 seconds... Seems there is plenty of room to grow? Also those miners have better internet-connections than the tiny "alibi-notes" that don't add a lot to the network anyway... Even my private home connection could upload a current 1MB block in 1 second... Never mind datacenters with commercial connections and symmetric up and down channels....
Could you please elaborate on "hierachical growth" a bit more? Did not really follow what you meant by that and how it impacts BTC...
3. Of course I verify them? Or rather my bank does? As I do by checking that the cash I receive is real money and not just printed out pictures of money on a piece of paper? Otherwise the system collapses in less than a day? Really don't understand your point here... If anybody can spend anybodies money, all money and BTC becomes instantly entirely pointless?
Again, thanks for engaging, you've already helped!
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:21:01
Really looking forward to this!

1. So why even keep the original blockchain? Either you need it or you don't...
2. We already agree on this 100%... Aggregation healthy to a point... Don't see how it ever get's down to "3 worldwide", though. That seems very far fetched/sensationalized to me...
3. I mean the time it takes stuff to propagate through the network... Latency, if you will...
4. I never claimed anything of the like... I'm referring to tiny, alibi miners... Like 4 nodes running on a single raspberry pie and other bullshit nodes... If I started mining with my PC right now: I'd be a bullshit node in my eyes...

Thank you for mentioning this,, a great point and also reminds me!
Does SegWit do anything to reduce or eliminate these spam transactions? Seems like that is a "must have" for future of BitCoin?
Also reminds me of the discussion Tone Vays vs Roger Ver, where Tone mentions he wouldn't mind transaction fees reaching 100 dollars per tx... That makes NO sense to me at all, UNLESS Bitcoin is a pure asset for saving and holding money, rather than using it to pay for stuff and USE it in any meaningful way.

Let me just leave this here...
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:25:50
When will we see Fees improving? Anybody got an educated guess?
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:39:28
1. I admit my knowledge on Lightning Network is limited, will read up on it! Did not know it affected scaling...
2. Ok, that might give us some room to work with then... Still, fixed 1MB block will continue to become a problem at some point...
The aggregation of miners long term may not be pretty... But that's pretty standard in ANY field of business... Also, like I mentioned elsewhere: "Private Miners" on BTC already do not add great value to the network... They ONLY add decentralization, IF that... I wouldn't be surprised if many of them had so much latency that the "2-Second/98% Hash power" had found a consensus on the block way before they weighed in...
Really interesting conversation!

Got it, thanks for clarifying!
