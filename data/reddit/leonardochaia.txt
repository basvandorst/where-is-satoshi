You have point.
It was a nice conversation. Have a wonderful weekend.

It saddens me to say that this has already happened.

Kindof, I mean, Satoshi's original idea was that BTC was anonymous and it was at that time. Now we've learnt that it's indeed pseudonymous.


Double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.
No mint or other trusted parties.
**Participants can be anonymous.**
New coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work.
The proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the
network to prevent double-spending.
- Satoshi Nakamoto 
I don't agree that traceability is a feature. I don't like how anyone in the world can see my public spendings. 
It makes sense for public organizations or non-profits that would like to have all their spending and funding public. But for the individual, it's nonsense.
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:35:04
would you elaborate, please?
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:39:47
I half agree with you. *but* sometimes you really don't have a choice. You can choose something different that Coinbase, but at the end of the day all exchanges are shit.
Perhaps you live in the US and you can find plenty offers on localbitcoins, but this is not the case everywhere.
Unfortunately, exchanges zuck, but are currently needed.
I really wish they would stand for their customers more and stop doing crazy shit in order to cover they asses when they don't really need to.

I may be wrong but I think Fluffypony actually lost a lot of crypto in a boat accident.

PUBLIC OPEN PERMISIONLESS SYSTEM
You can't have a fucking open system and not like certain people who use 
it. 
This people do not represent the crypto community; they represent the business people who are profiting off the people's money.
FUCK YOU COINBASE.

Gitea for the win?

Ok, so you don't need free speech because you have nothing to say?
YOU may have nothing to hide, but there are other people in life threatening situations that need to keep things private. Perhaps you're a lucky guy living on US soil enjoying all your human rights. **this is not the case in the entire world**. People need privacy in order to survive criminal regimes, domestic violence, espionage, corrupt governments exposure and so on.


It's not about sensitive information. It's about any information. If I choose to keep things private, it's my absolute right to do so.
Why should anyone be able to see my personal information, spendings, personal preferences, sexual preferences, or any information at all if I do not consent for it? I am the owner of my life and I choose to do with my personal information whatever I desire.
If you have nothing to hide, then please, why don't you make public your banking info? sexual preferences? Why do you use a nickname instead of your real name? why do you cover your windows with curtains? why do you cover your parts when someone you don't trust see you naked?
It's a natural human reflect to keep things private. You should be respectful of other human beings who need privacy to survive.

You know very well that I'm not gonna be able to give you the amount of people that transacted in this block, since I'm not a chain analysis enterprise.
There are well known business addresses and even some block explorer show you the business/exchange name next to the BTC address. If I know that address X belongs to Jane, I can trace how Jane's BTC got there in the first place and see where it goes next.
I am aware that there are multiple things one could do in order to improve Bitcoins anonymity (like mixing), but come on, lets be honest here, wouldn't it be better if it just worked that way?
We can agree to disagree. I love Bitcoin, but I'm truly worried about a future where most of transactions can be linked.
I'd really appreciate if you would explain me what is that I do not understand about our conversation. I'm not saying I know it all, I definitively don't and I don't consider myself an expert or even having advanced knowledge on the topic. So please, kind redditor, enlight me and correct me so I can know better.
I appreciate you keeping answering since I'm not trying to be stubborn, just saying what I believe, which of course can be wrong, as I'm a human being myself.

Time will come when they will realize that they were the crazy ones.
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:10:49
Fair enough.


I believe that this has already been proven either with Monero or ZCash. The math is complex but it is possible.


This is an excellent, and totally correct quote. I agree with you 100%, if you screw up, there's nothing the tech can do to help you. It can lead you to the right path, but the rest is up to you. And this applies to all cryptos, until we can find a way for the users to have to do nothing at all.


I get your point. Personally it's not a matter of need. I just like to keep my things to myself.
Despite of this, I think that financial privacy is very important because of the impact that it has when analyzed together with social mass-data collection.
I also believe that, people can judge you because of what you buy, it can be just a "bad look" but it can also affect you in your work life, if people for example find you you consume any illegal substance, or whatever.


I agree with you on this one as well, specially on the censorship resistant. What do you mean about the last sentence though, "even without it being its primary objective (quite the opposite in a way)."
It's my understanding that Satoshi wanted the system to be anonymous, from what I've read of course.
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:30:01


That was the entire fucking point of Satoshi's system.

You should add Monero :)

Stop playing with my currency :(

Fellow Argentinian here.
I feel you, my friend. I really hope Venezuela can be what it was, soon enough.
Crypto will save us latin americans.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:31:27
That looks awesome.
There's something that I don't understand. Where's the fiat coming from?
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:49:03
Ah I see. It's different to what I was expecting.
Will sign up and give you feedback.  
Looking good so far. Keep up the good work.

Damn, that sucks :(
Just wondering, I've never done OAuth with Twitter, although I'm familiar with the protocol.
Usually the consent screen is formed according to the scopes you request when requesting a token.
If you just want to validate identity and get a valid email address, an Identity Token should be enough.
When you're requesting the id token, are you requesting any scope other than "email"? 
Still, email-only sign up would probably be pretty appreciated for paranoids :)
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:11:33
Why would you need permission to "**Read Tweets from my timeline**" and "**See who I follow**"???
