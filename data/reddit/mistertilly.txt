I see I see. You're messing with us. Nobody is this stupid. 
Take care.

I asked for you to provide an example that Peterson is xenophobic. Instead you came back with this. Well done. 
"Vile" and "horrible" are also words that can be used to describe morons spouting baseless garbage to slander someone with horrific claims and no proof.

You argue like a person who has only read and then drawn conclusions from slanted headlines about Jordan Peterson meant to make him look bad.
He has thousands of hours of lectures on Youtube. I've watched hundreds of those hours. Nothing xenophobic about the guy in the slightest—point to an example if I'm wrong, I'd love to see it—don't much care for xenophobes. 
I've been to one of his lectures and read his book 12 Rules for Life. I just don't see the people you're describing or the views you're trying to project onto him and the people who like what he says. 
He deserves critique and there's plenty he says that I have disagree with, but the dude is a centrist if anything, willing to go after identity politics whether it's being played by the Left or the Right. 
P.S. "Please don't idolize Peterson and please don't shoot up innocent people at mosques." could be the most baffling sentence I've ever read. 
It would be like me saying "Please don't idolize Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and please don't rape penguins."
 What does one have to do with the other?

It's a great flick. Give it a watch.

Thank you for the sampling of veiled intimidation that the billion+ people of China get on a daily basis. 
Not super tasty—needs more MSG.

Spoilers: I hate Trump, a lot. Incel? I mean, it's been a while, but also, if I have my lips latched onto some overlord's dick doesn't that neutralize my incel status? Because technically...
Free Tip: Saying someone is something over and over doesn't make it true. Still waiting for that proof you keep promising that Peterson is xenophobic. You just have to have that whole pesky "evidence" thing to be taken seriously. It's rough, I know.
And holy shit, now I'm celebrating an act of terror? Since when? Where? Point to it. Holy shit, dude....
Free compliment: That's some absolute first class straw-manning there, buddy. Bravo. Bravo. 
And finally, my impression of "Everything is xenophobic. Literally everything."

If anyone wants a fun read, go through the comment history of  He's anti Hong Kong protests, pro China, and seems to revel in spreading FUD when it comes to Bitcoin. 
For all of those reasons I see his presence here as bullish for the longterm. 
Now I'm not calling you a Chinese operative looking to spread fear so the CCP can consolidate cheaper Bitcoin, but I'm also not not calling you that.

Uh oh. Someone's cover has been compromised. Taiwan numah one!

No confusion here. Never referenced you as a shill. 
Thanks for stopping by—means a lot. Now I'll let you get back to promoting the interests of the CCP.

Your first comment is a lighter shade of FUD. You might be wrong, you might be right, but you clearly made that comment to make peoples hands a little bit weaker.
