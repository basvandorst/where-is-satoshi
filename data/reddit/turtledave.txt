I've been wondering where/ if you can see individual orders.  Can you tell me how to view them?

Pretty cool sub.  I subbed. While there, I checked about 10 threads and didn't see one single RemindMe! bot mention.  I figured that sub would be a haven for that bot.

I suppose keeping it in GDAX is just as unsafe?  Fairly new to this, don't have a lot yet.

Ok, that sounds a lot better to me than what I thought was the case.  I'll try to be patient.  Thank you.

Thank you.

OK, thank you so much!  I thought my first foray into cryptos was going to end miserably.

Copy and paste.

I did the transaction in GDAX, where it says Confirmed, but checked Coinbase where [THIS]( is in the list (looks like two transactions).  The top one seems to be the [GDAX Transfer]( and the bottom one seems to be the [Coinbase Transfer](  It says pending.  So, that's good, right?

I entered the address and it said no transactions. Not sure if the address is personal
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:55:10
Ok, I did that.  Can you see my reply to below and tell me if you think I'm ok?  Thank you so much for working with me.
