To what standard? 
It's not as well regulated as it could be, sure. But if we are comparing an unregulated market to the U.S. financial market, it's certainly well regulated.

We’re basically a marketing agency that saw the opportunity in DC and jumped in. Most campaigns are way overspending on nonsense like TV commercials and direct mailers because the consultants make easy 15% commissions from those buys and the entrenched good old boys club is full of firms that have been doing it that way forever.
Our goal is to build audiences in social media based on behaviors we know indicate someone is likely to agree with the message (and in many cases using the voter records directly to build custom audiences of individuals we know are registered to vote already) and then feed engaging content. Yes some of that is memes.
We aren’t doing any bot nets or anything to fake organic engagement with the content. But the Trump campaign benefited from that at a big scale (comments on “no collusion” aside). We prefer to make something compelling enough that with some paid media behind it people will pick it up and run with it on their own.
One campaign we are running in Maryland even publishes all of the content we make on his website to demonstrate his commitment to transparency. 
And if you are curious we work with progressives only.

I run a digital agency that uses data and social content to support political campaigns and I have no problem saying memes helped Trump win.
The saying in DC has always been “themes win elections, not issues” and memes are a modern way to communicate themes.

Deregulation is a fun talking point but the American financial market is still insanely regulated with an entire agency dedicated to it's oversight. It's not like the SEC is just sitting around twiddling it's thumbs all day.
To say it's not predominately well regulated sounds like someone sitting in a tent at Occupy Wall Street riffing about the man and not someone objectively looking at it in comparison to the alternative of zero regulation or oversight.

You just described Reddit.
Even me saying that is so Reddit.

That's not the actions of a crusader for truth.

Yeah, Trump, a serial liar and building developer from New York, is just a bastion for equity, truth and justice.

The guy was literally selling anti-Hillary merch and peddling conspiracies with no evidence during the 2016 elections. Oh, and colluding with the Trump campaign and Russian operatives behind the scenes - this isn't a conspiracy, this is in public filed court papers.
People are being intentionally obtuse if they don't see exactly why many people's perceptions of him changed given these actions. It's not about tribalism, it's about him being the complete opposite of what people thought he was.
I actually never liked him because it was clear his ego was at the center of Wikileaks. I don't even see how anyone here could remotely compare that to bitcoin which is decentralized and whose creator is anonymous.

The article I posted was about how he directly helped Trump win the election. I said that’s not the actions of some crusader for truth. You said it is.
Pay attention.

Index funds spread the investment to reduce the risk. Of course they are far safer than putting all your chips in bitcoin and the fact that this is discussion is silly.

Most banks these days offer you paid dividends and interest for holding your money unless your literally just letting $5 sit in your account while receiving monthly paper statements that cost them $.50 a pop.

Stop moving the goal posts. Point is there are plenty of banks that don't charge you to hold cash in an account
