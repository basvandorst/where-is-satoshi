when buying altcoins, is it cheaper to exchange from ltc to eth to altcoin or ltc to eth to btc to altcoin?

Whats the best altcoin exchange? I've heard binance and bittrex but am skeptical of bittrex. Any thoughts on cex.io?

I bought bitcoin at 16000 for 1000$ thinking it will keep going up, i can break even and back out now because it seems it keeps going down, idk the whole situation bought bitcash but i fear it will keep going down because of ghat, should i sell half and see where it takes me?

Should i buy bitcoin right now or wait until people can sell bitcash

WE RISE. AGAIN.

Are you trolling me or is that a serious advice, i dont wanna lose money i mean i wont be in debt or anything but 1000 is still a lot to me
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:36:58
I never said i wouldve gone in debt or anything like that, 1000, even if i lose it all, wont hurt me lifestyle wise, stop judging that i put all of my savings into it, all i said was i didnt want to lose momey because who likes losing money
