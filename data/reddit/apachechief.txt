No, you can. Literally the same as money. I can print you a private key with .1 BTC on it, hand it to you, and you can be on your way.
Just like with a real dollar there is **NO WAY** to verify its authenticity! However, with a Bitcoin you can verify its authenticity and that it cannot be double spent. You need to connect to thousands of peers (effectively, you can do this with only 4-8 direct connections, exponential) to verify the money. You *cannot* do this with CASH but you can with BTC.


You just described one. How do you know money is real? What is the consensus that the $100 bill you got is real? How do you know it wasn't printed in Russia or North Korea?


Because what is the limit? Who is it up to? Whoever is in charge??? What if Trump and friends somehow print a stupid amount of money? Bitcoin is resistant to this because Bitcoin already has very conservative standards set in place.
Ask Zimbabwe why printing more and more money is a problem. Or Venezuela. Or Argentina. Or Brazil. Or India.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:32:45


So wait we still got all the capital to build 5 factories but you are disagreeing with me that pushing more units doesn't increase their revenue? OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Dude you are super wrong, if I make a product, sell so many I can't even get 2 items on the shelf before the first 1 is gone, then I am looking good. **Of course I shouldn't spread myself too thin and make 5 factories when I maybe only need 1 additional.**
You don't know what you're talking about, it's insanely simple and you're making it stupidly complicated.

Wow like 4 comments negative about bitcoin the minute this was posted, impressive shilling!
Here are some instances I run into often:
* Man I'd like to just send him some money 
* International wire transfers cost $20/ea and take weeks, then if there is a problem takes weeks to undo/resolve
* I want to "stream money" to someone for this new app idea
* I want a contract that moves money IFTT style
* I want a store of value that I can rely on
Off the top of my head, I think about uses for Bitcoin all the time. It's unfortunate how hard it is to integrate with, but so was Facebook and Email way back when.
# The lightning network and instant fee-less payments will make transactions between Fedex and Amazon cheap as fuck. It's going to change the world. Think about how much volume that is, for free, instantly verified, instantly accounted for...
Oh, you're already connected to Amazon to do most of your transactions? Boom, you're *connected with everyone in the world now, basically* because Amazon will have connections across the entire Lightning Network. Your coffee shop orders their filters from Amazon.

....you are hording money right now while people are starving. Ever consider following your own beliefs instead of trying to force them on others? Instead of complaining about Bill Gates not giving, why aren't you leading by example? Give what you can. Certainly you don't *need* a refrigerator, you could learn to eat raw food and vegetables. You could give all that wealth to poor people, **why don't you put your money where your mouth is?**


NO! Because that's hilariously stupid. You need to learn history, people have done this thousands of times and it never turns out well. In Russia they killed all of the rich people because they were "exploitive" and "greedy." Welp, turns out the rich people were actually the best farmers and provided the best products/services. They killed the rich and then **millions** died, in the name of fairness. COOL!


Literally, yes, this is how the world/nature works. It's called the Pareto Principle. Averaged out over every group there will be a few people much more productive and many people not productive. About 80% of work is done by 20% of the people. And this is fractal. In the 20% doing the work, the top 80% of the work is done by the top 20%, again! And again, and again, until you arrive at Warren Buffet, Elon Musk, etc.
There will always be people that much better than others. In basketball, in football, in finance, in business, etc. etc. etc. We shouldn't punish people for being so skilled at football they blow everyone else out of the water. 
There was a shift in perspectives at some point in US history. You should be happy these people are so successful, not jealous. You shouldn't try to lobby gov't to steal their money.

Man, you are really not convincing me.
I think of it this way: I am Amazon and I deal with Fedex and **billions** of customers (potentially, at least). It costs me 2% in fees, processing, accounting, etc. to do all of these payments and fix charge backs and other problems. As much as I can leverage Lightning network, with 0 fees, like if I **just had a payment channel with Fedex** and that saves me .5% in all my fees... that makes me billions of dollars
2 companies adopting it, Fedex and Amazon, for just that one account, would be insane. There are huge incentives to do it, as well!

About what now?
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:23:43
You can structure the lightning payment in such a way that you have people watch it. If at any time someone tries to steal money (i.e. your computer goes offline for a bit and they were holding some funds en route to destination) these watchers can enforce your contract, redeem all the funds (and as punishment for being a bad actor, take all the funds in the channel I believe), and the watcher gets a pre-defined cut.
So I can have a simple watcher script running that costs almost nothing, but makes a huge amount of money for me if I find bad actors. I'm incentivized to police the system.
Also, the money you put in a channel has a "lock time" so it automatically goes back to your wallet, I believe.

You connect to the lightning *network* where you are basically a node in a graph of all people on lightning, so you should be able to use that channel to communicate with basically anyone. Also, in the future, we'll have channel factories where you connect to thousands of people who are connected to thousands more so you can get the lowest fees.
Also, joining a channel factory takes like 1% the transaction space as sending a single transaction to start a payment channel?

@_date: 2018-01-03 03:14:02
You don't understand. People are purposefully pushing the fees to these amounts. If it's 1mb or 4mb they can still push fees higher than normal. What you need are **computer science/engineering** improvements, not infrastructure improvements.

My father was in a car accident that left him completely disabled. He had insurance. Insurance covered it. My family helped take care of him. We didn't need gov't at all.
You know what? **Gov't gets in the way of us getting novel treatments that may cure my father's permanent brain damage.** The biggest thing between us and awesome stem cells that may one day save him: the damaging regulations **written by big businesses** that harm consumers. There are untolds amounts of suffering in the name of FDA approving drugs.
How much does it cost to get drugs through this regulatory laden red tape shit show? $2.5 BILLION. For some shit medicine. How is my father going to get help when it costs $2.5bn just to get through the door?
Think about how foolish you are. You are saying people must pool their money, non-voluntarily, and have someone distribute it "fairly." 
How about these other situations:
* Mental health problems
* Bad knees
* Bad back
* Fucked up teeth
How does gov't handle those problems? I know people with bad knees/backs who waited months for help in Canada... I know people suffering from severe depression unable to afford help in Europe...
Think of it like public education. Do you want Trump educating children and choosing their health solutions? **Do you think people should control their own money and make their own decisions?**
That's capitalism, you fool. Socialism is relinquishing your decisions to Trump, or whoever is in charge. Look at Venezuela. What was Hitler's party called? The nationalist socialists???

In the future it will be easier to "top up" but consider that while you may put .1btc ($2k...) in a node, you may get *paid* to this node as well.
So if you get paid a bit, spend a bit, etc. you could live perpetually on lightning network. 1 transaction (I believe) to open the channel and that's it. This is pretty unviable right now... no one paying over LN ;)

Internet (the "road" of Bitcoin) isn't going away any time soon, and you can certainly get around any kind of blocking because packets can be encrypted (resistant to shaping).
One of Bitcoins **strengths** is that it can't be censored and requires very little to broadcast a transaction. This makes it the most decentralized, censorship resistant, anti-fragile money we've ever seen.

@_date: 2018-01-14 19:39:14
Controls all paths.............. yeah..........
You can't choose the path, the originator chooses the path... btw, how many possible connections would there be in the graph that Alice controls? Are we talking about controlling hundreds of connections, billions of connections, or trillions of connections?
What about routing back-and-forth to the same node or other ridiculous obfuscation? You don't know who originated the message, or when it will end..
Also consider the popularity of "cyclical connections" which would apparently be a nice solution for rebalancing your channels... just read about that in a paper..
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:54:16
You don't, because you don't have that much money in the account...........?
You deposit more into the account then make the payment. LN isn't suited for large payments, anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:21:32
Yeah no that makes sense, just arbitrarily one night Godman Sachs will have ruined Bitcoin....?

You can run a node without mining. You can do this for free. I do this. Many people do this.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:35:28
Huh? Look at a 1yr chart and draw some trend lines, ya knucklehead
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:28:22
Cool, so given your knowledge about routing, how would you implement a solution for finding a path in a graph like Lightning? What are the pros and cons of alternative routing methods that you are familiar with? I asked you to describe BGP and you didn't, hence more specific questions.


Google............. there are tons of academic papers on routing. There are specific ones for Lightning.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:01:40
...nothing. nothing is stopping you from making Facebook, why would it be hard to replace Facebook? Network effects are strong.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:17:55
You haven't demonstrated any understanding of anything and statements like ***"The truth is a big deal."*** in terms of how there's no possible way to route in Lightning is lying.
So, don't lie.


If that gives you a clue as to where to look, then you have 0 experience and are lying. Stop lying.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:11:56
Oh so it's easier to setup a node and RPC you knucklehead?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:53:58
...? What does that have to do with it having the ability to use segwit...?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:35:18
Do *full* nodes verify blocks or not? What does a full node even do, if not mining?
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:44:22
Not really, friend. It's in "production" right now so it's blown past alpha and beta.
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:52:58

@_date: 2018-01-24 02:12:38
It's natural for a few to have most. That distribution occurs in almost every system... this is not unique to Bitcoin, and applies to every crypto.
A few basketball players are the best and in a league of their own. A few StarCraft competitors are in a league of their own. Billionaire investors, league of their own.
Does it matter a few people own billions in bitcoin? Not really, obviously they can manipulate the market. So can billions of cash though. I think you get why it doesn't matter? A group of a hundred medium fish, what about that...

@_date: 2018-01-25 20:24:31
Does that work with a min of 3-6 connections?
Does that work if (nearly) every transaction you make on chain also opens/closes a payment channel? Oh someone paid you $300 for painting their fence? Well, since you asked nicely, they paid you via a payment channel so you can spend that straight on LN. You'll probably do this quite a few times and have quite a few channels open in many directions.. I think..

@_date: 2018-01-15 22:57:29
You make bitcoin more appealing by obviously lying. Bcash will fail horribly in the wake of this.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:30:54


No. If blocks aren't full you could, potentially, pay 0 fees.


That full blocks are great. Fees this high


Right... not disagreeing on that. Disagreeing that we'll have just as strong of a fee market with larger blocks. Moving block size means it will probably happen again sooner and push back incentive for producing improvements that make the blockchain better. Increasing blocksize is one of the worst things we can do to improve bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:58:35
........what? Yeah BCash sucks and objectively a worse version than Bitcoin, what is your point?
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:09:36
What that's like no growth lol
I do appreciate it though, pumped to see what happens.. working on getting LN running myself
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:24:38
Depends, really. Buying a car? Probably no need to even open a lightning channel with that much at stake in a hot wallet, should just keep private key on hardware wallet and sign transaction that way.

@_date: 2018-01-19 19:47:30
I believe currently all clients confirm to 0.167 max, but you and Alice could easily re-compile and agree on 0.2. Lightning "Network" doesn't care, but your clients do.
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:37:23

....yeah you get it from reading other comments I think...
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:16:54
Well, if you don't know what Bitcoin is resistant against then I assume you don't live in:
* Brazil
* Venezuela
* India
You should research what has happened to these places. You are "ignorant" :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:37:50
Yeah, that would be mining not running a node. Obviously mining requires fees.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:23:58
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:02:01
Well, yeah, the premise is failed. It's not decentralized, has no developers, and has no scaling solution.

@_date: 2018-01-19 19:49:34

Yeah these definitions are weird right now... you could definitely do LN through some hardware thing connected to the Internet I guess, but that still seems "hot" even though its hardware sandboxed.

@_date: 2018-01-06 21:35:22
Or, you shouldn't be so anxious. Very, very possible no one cared about Bitcoin. Yes we're spied on horrifyingly, we know. OK, we can say "lol" on a forum, friend.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:15:09
Yeah, you can probably get them back by properly setting up things but it's still painful. I really don't understand the dismissiveness towards testing... I guess they are terrified it will give LN a bad look to have failures...?
I think it will be wonderful to have something out there failing and being iterated on extremely quickly. That's one of the big benefits of layers, faster iteration.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:31:07
Not concerning at all. VPN + open many channels to large distinct nodes and sometimes take a not-optimal path = you good boi

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:42:52
Yes it was. That's what node means.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:20:28
Yeah that's what they currently do and probably will forever, I'll run a node forever... probably.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:32:28
It takes 30 days for your credit card payment to "settle" and the money to actually end up in the businesses hand. This is slow.
Bitcoin transactions are instantly verified, but take a while to end up "confirmed" and placed into a block. This is what the 10 minutes are for. **For lightning, you will wait for ~3 confirmations then you can spend instantly with 0 fees.**
So, if you move $1000 worth of BTC onto lightning network, it will stay there until you take it off. And you can spend that $1000 instantly. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:44:16
....right.. that's only one of the "unfunded liabilities" we have.

@_date: 2018-01-11 00:54:55
I'm wondering this, too, but I believe a channel can receive more than it started with, but it has to receive this in chunks less than the channel size......
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:20:19
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:39:26


That's true, but why did Facebook beat MySpace? Was it massive network effect? What crypto has more network effect than Bitcoin? Does Ethereum have a futures market? That's kinda what I mean.
BTC has solved scaling via Lightning Network and improvements like Schnorr signatures. Energy consumption is a good criticism, but, [unfortunately I think it's the best option.](
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:46:13
So wait, over the last year Bitcoin has grown about 15x -- what is that trending towards?
Compare the trend of Bitcoin vs Bcash from Bcash's inception... I mean, Bitcoin is *very* strong and gobbling up competitors like crazy. So is Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:00:51

Yes. Ln has solutions to these that keep decentralisation.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:16:34
No he's right competely. If people are pumping billions of dollars into the market saying "I need this" then someone on the other end is going to want to provide it.

@_date: 2018-01-30 06:34:47
A single user having many channels is not only practical, it is how it will work! You want ~3 connections, probably, to remove the attack vectors (from DDoS and such).
Almost every transaction, on chain, in the future will *also* open a lightning channel.

Limited supply, lots of demand.


Technology no longer useful, network effect gone.
What black swan event would make this global network get smaller, instead of get larger? I feel like even if something terrible happened, the value would spread as people dumped it but the technology and network would remain relevant. In the long game, Bitcoin should be worth an insane amount as it is the best technology. It has the "magical properties" like gold not tarnishing, but in this case it's leaderless, anti-fragile, and censorship resistance that are the useful properties.
Can you give some example black swan events? Are you talking like a Solar Flare level thing that basically wipes out everything, or another Mt Gox? Another Mt Gox is nothing...

@_date: 2018-01-19 19:58:00
Yes, a ton stops them.. like needing developers who can even understand and work on it. LN was built around Segwit, so they'll have to re-do all of that work for whatever malleability fix they use that's non-segwit so BCash can continue exploiting ASICBOOST.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:45:22
No you haven't.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:36:13

Think of "Lightning Network" as an exchange, like Poloniex. You send crypto to Poloniex and you can play with it/move around freely on their exchange. Move it between wallets. Trade it with people. Instantly.
When you're done on Poloniex you send it back to regular Bitcoin on chain! You could "live" on Lightning Network.

I run a full node, it is a bitch to sync. Do you run a full node? Why are transactions expensive right now -- if they are so expensive why not use segwit? Do you understand these problems are complex, and childish solutions like "dad just buy a new computer *geez*" don't work in the real world with constrained resources? 
Whether it's 1mb, 4mb, or 8mb (it's 2mb currently with segwit) the blockchain tech itself doesn't scale. You need layers.
People want segwit, obviously, but we can't force its implementation. That's kinda the point of Bitcoin, ya know, freedom.

Errr, right. So how many times, on a payment channel that I open with 1 BTC, can I receive 1BTC to that channel?


Right, but other people can do on-chain transactions to add funds **to the lightning network** and then send those funds to me. Or they could have done that 10 years ago and the channel is still open.


Ugh misread this so many times: you can fund more than the original amount, it just takes many transactions. (to my understanding)
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:03:26
Can you explain that a bit more, please? What do you mean?

@_date: 2017-12-16 03:26:12


1mb or 32mb doesn't matter. This is **not** scaling properly.
When you are programming a game and it's going slow should you a) buy a second graphics card to make it faster but fewer people will be able to play with a 2 gfx card requirement or b) optimize the game to get the **exact same thing** but runs on every computer, even cell phones.
You don't understand exponential improvements.
32mb blocks = ~100 transactions per second.. wow! Amazing!

How much would it cost to spam a bunch of 1s/b transactions hmmmmmmmmmmmm
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:14:21

Gee I wonder how many people would be incentivized to use this...?


Yes. Well enough to know the implications and hodl.


Do you think there is no more development to be done here? You can fund payment channels without closing them, apparently, thanks to new techniques!


What's a better alternative? BIGGER BLOCKS!? LOOOOOOOOOOOOL! That's *not* a solution to scaling.
That'd be like if when Google started, they immediately jumped to a huge datacenter, instead of using **computer science** to leverage trillions of operations better instead of just doing trillions more operations!

Not really how lighting works. You will basically pay one main block fee to spend however much you want and keep the channel open indefinitely.
Scales basically infinitely
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:52
Pretty dumb stuff. I can open a lighting node to Amazon, because I often shop there, and keep it open indefinitely. You know what else, anyone else that exists on the lighting network... I can talk to them! I only need one channel open..
Every node on lighting could be running on one single transaction each, forever. And they all compete on fees. It's great for everyone ya knucklehead.

Literally, yes, going from 1 to 2 is not an improvement that is worth the cost. We can stay at 1 and process 100000000000x more transactions. Gee, I wonder which is the better solution?


Oh man thanks for explaining that! I was just wondering: what happens when 32mb * 144blocks/day = ~5gb/day needs to be transferred around the network? Do you run a full node? That would be **~155gb/mo or ~~2TB/yr**. Talk about centralized, let alone transmitting that data around
How long does it take to sync your full node?


...what... 


Right!!! Which is why exponential gains like LN solve this problem. Learn about payment channels. If you want to spend 1 BTC you can open a payment channel for that 1BTC and spend from it indefinitely. 1 transaction fee, for the life of that BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:49:30

@_date: 2017-12-30 02:30:16
Getting you into the lightning network, if that even works. Once you are in you can receive funds. The only way to get funds on LN is on chain, but I believe you should be able to create a payment channel with 0 funds on both sides.... the person you are opening the payment channel with should have connections with other people so you are effectively connected to the entire graph.
It may not work, I just saw someone mention authoritatively that you can start a payment channel with 0 funds on each side OFF chain.... trying to confirm this, haven't yet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:17:35

@_date: 2017-12-30 02:04:43
[Here's]( some explaining for how we will handle millions of payment channels.. a clip from the abstract:


the blockchain and the payment channels. The new layer addresses the
scalability problem by enabling trust-less off-blockchain channel funding.
It consists of shared accounts of groups of nodes that flexibly create oneto-one
channels for the payment network. The new system allows rapid
changes of the allocation of funds to channels and reduces the cost of
opening new channels. Instead of one blockchain transaction per channel,
each user only needs one transaction to enter a group of nodes – within
the group the user can create arbitrary many channels. For a group of 20
users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transactions
is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels
opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin
introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.*
These are actual computer science solutions to computer science problems. Increasing blocksize is, as a solution, literally retarded.


Lightning works almost exclusively off chain, so....
I'm trying to find more information, i.e. starting a "payment channel" with 0 funds on each side so no need to even hit blockchain, haven't found anything yet. Could easily be wrong about that.

Meanwhile there's already a way to compress it 90% right in front of you (Segwit + Schnorr) and on top of that, a way to take that 90% further with a 2nd layer that can handle infinite transactions (off chain!)...
It's dumb to not just install 7zip and compress your stuff. If it's already completely compressed (like Video) THEN you explore new harddrives. We're not even remotely compressed, though, in Bitcoin world.

OK genius, what is actually limiting transactions per second? Size! How large is a transaction? What if you can batch them? What if there's a way to reduce their size by 90% so you can fit that-many-more transactions on chain? Why do exchanges batch transactions?

It's an attack on the network, really. Bitcoin is antifragile. Attacks on it make it stronger. Segwit will get more adopted. LN is already working and will take off quite a bit of stress.

Re-read my post please and address it line-by-line so we can clear this up, because I absolutely addressed that:


So if it would take 10 million transactions to **start** the Lightning network with 10 million participants, that number would be reduced by 90%. So if we have 7TPS now with 1MB and that takes 16 days, then a 90% reduction would be to ~1 day. If we increase block size to 1.7MB and get ~12TPS then it's less than 1 day. For 10 **million** people.
If we have schnorr signatures, etc. etc. then that goes down even further. Not to mention payment channels can stay open forever. I could have 1 payment channel for the rest of my life.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:45:23


There is nothing to switch to that is faster. The other options aren't faster, they have literally the same problems when many people start using it! It's hilarious.
You guys think processors succeeded by going from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc? No. They went from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32 etc. etc. 
Linear gains, like increasing block size, are not good computer science solutions. You have limited resources. For bitcoin you *want* limited resources.


This is dumb. It's not delayed the same way streaming on Twitch wasn't delayed. It's just not ready...

I think that makes sense. Creating a channel is just a transaction. You and someone else sign the transaction, they send you funds, you can close the channel on chain or start doing your own lighting transactions.
Someone could offer a service giving you a lightning channel in exchange for sharing personal information, just like how you use YouTube and Facebook.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:41:25
Wait -- what vague statistical models are you talking about? What speculation? It's like a biologist studying species, there may not be enough information but it's certainly a scientific process. Like explaining ant behavior, that's not scientific?

Yes but it will be harder to mine from increased difficulty. Your processor is the same speed, but if you try the newest games it may be slower than it was in older games.

And fees are public information, with people competing to have the best node people want to connect to. Proof of Stake, in a way. Why would you connect to someone who is shitty? Easy enough to connect to someone else.


Yes you can.. they just have to have a connection, you don't make the connection, new paths could be arbitrarily chosen to add entropy.
The choices aren't very limited because the fees will come close to the marginal cost of running a lightning node, which are basically 0.

Yeah I'm not sure if you can start with no funds (it makes sense though), but obviously channels can receive more funds than they start with...... Those funds were added on chain but exist in lightning network, almost anyone on ln can receive it.
You yourself can't add funds without on chain, but the coins can exist in ln already...

@_date: 2017-12-29 17:54:31
Please Google around, you do not need on chain transactions to move money between channels. You just need to put the money in *a* channel. This is like the most basic part of what makes lightning cool. If you couldn't move between channels..... Well, no point really?
I'm not sure about being able to participate with no on chain transaction ever, just something I heard which I can't verify. But, I know lighting is multisig with time lock, and if you don't have coins to time lock you may not need to be on chain! You just create a channel transaction that is empty and fill it from lighting channels with on chain money.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:46:05

@_date: 2017-12-12 10:22:00
Google transaction fee calculator. Also lighting network will be 1 transaction to open a pre paid channel that you can spend from near instantly to other wallets.
Imagine Amazon and FedEx being able to do all of their transactions instantly for free............
Then imagine that anyone with a channel open to Amazon probably has a channel to Netflix, Walmart, etc and boom you have a way to route to cousin Bob who shops at Walmart. When you open a payment channel it's like becoming a router on the internet, kinda.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:38:03
....think about it this way..
Alice is a random no body with NOTHING. Bob is a node with tons of connections with BTC in them. Somehow we open a channel together off chain with 0 BTC in it. Then, Alice is effectively connected to everyone Bob connected to, Bob or anyone else can send Alice some coins.
Get it? The other people with coins connected to Bob, or Bob himself, already made on chain transactions at some point putting coins on lightning network. When you connect to *anyone* on lightning network, you are connected to *everyone* (assuming they are on the same graph).

Currently Bitcoin is unregulated and doing fine. Altcoins are annoying, but people will grow to associate Bitcoin with stability in a market of coins to choose from. I think we should have regulations that have broad fruad-based protections, but we do *not* want to give politicians so much power!


No, negative consequences. What if I fudge the law up in such a way where only certain organizations can be approved, and the requirements are such that only my organizations can be approved? Seems like a good way to get rent seeking behavior.


Very different question than what I am asking, moving the goalpost quite far... we can have protections for fraud but not state-wide laws banning the sale of Bitcoin unless you have a License of which they only make 10 of.. on and on and on.
Why do we need laws for the sale of weed? Do we need laws for the sale of tomatoes? Again, broad-based laws covering things that causes personal harm or are fraudulent make more sense. The more specific, the more power, the more potential for abuse.

You *can* have socialism inside capitalism, but people should have a choice, right? "Pride of ownership" -- who mentioned that?


Errr, right...... I want to own my stuff. I want to be responsible for the good and the bad.


Oh, okay, so which system is the most innovative and why?


Yes and they get insane bonuses/leverage these skills into insane wages. I've done small versions of this myself, and a friend of mine makes $400k+/yr at Microsoft for a badass frontend library he made. It's open source, owned by no one, but private industry + profit still recognize that value! You need private ownership, but within private ownership you can have people consent to public ownership. Forced public = socialism.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:04:34


Can you be more specific here? This is different than what the article says, which is just a 51% attack


Pretty funny, everything I've been saying is in this article already...

Just to be sure we're on the same page, what do you think capitalism means? Does it mean you can just murder people, or does it mean your money is yours not someone elses?
Google's definition of capitalism:


All that means is you control your money. It doesn't mean you can pay people to fight to the death...
In a socialist society, the public owns things. It's not yours. In both systems you can have regulations. I.e. in Venezuela GM's car factory was taken by the public. If you don't even own your stuff, how can you prosper...?
In a capitalist society, you could even have a socialist business that is owned by everyone in the company -- you can do whatever you want with your money in capitalism, including sharing it!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:10:08

I am not saying is "hurculan," I'm saying it's do-able. I often times get from Socialist guys that there is some kind of degrading aspect to hard work, it's weird. What was my "background in tech" before... creating my background...? What was my business before I made it?
It's not a zero sum game, you know what that means? The "pie" actually grows as more people learn more skills.


We're talking about socialism vs capitalism man -- not trying to impress you?


Yeah I donated to Bernie Sanders, learned a lot more about the efficacy of his positions, and now I am almost the polar opposite. Reaaaaaaaal closed minded of me! 


So? I love capitalism. I have a huge amount of meaning in my life *that I would have missed out on* if I wasn't basically forced to start a business because of the circumstances. I wanted to be a teacher. There's no way I'd have been able to help people like I have in this path. 
I've literally made men successful, it feels amazing. I can't wait to keep doing it. Makes me excited to go to work -- not because of the work, but the *real* impact I have on the world with my freedom. We're working on making games in our free time.. it's really a blast.
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:29:39

USA is mixed, like pretty much every economy.


Why? How can a company restrict your personal freedom?


Yep, that's capitalism. Socialism can exist "inside" capitalism, because you control your money. By choice you can participate in socialism. Socialism is bad when it's forced, like by a state, like with heavy redistributionary taxes.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:06:18
Yes most every economy is mixed at this point, and yes there are a few profitable state owned businesses like Norway oil (I believe).

I literally have done this, with no college experience that's the only way I'd be able to work as a software engineer. You have to provide value to a company. I've trained 3 people and given them careers with no former training, as well. Taught the men to fish, feels very fulfilling.


I don't care if everyone isn't like me, they should have *choice* though. State enforced socialism is no good. Socialism can exist in capitalism, not the other way around. Capitalism rewards innovation and risk... but, some businesses don't *need* risk, like WinCo. Employee owned businesses in staples like grocery marts is an amazing idea/business model. And it's consensual, not enforced by the state.

Yeah if only we had some kind of new technology that makes such operations trivial, even, automated...?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:42:40
...right, so needing $2k in hardware and $N in bandwidth is a cost. How many people can pay this cost? OK well then if fewer people can pay that cost it is more centralized, and weaker.
Consider the latest and greatest video games. Of course they could only support the best hardware and make a far better (graphically) game, but network effect is more important. It's better to have optimizations and the ability to support cheap harder, than it is to rely on expensive hardware.
Should games force you to buy a 1080ti, or should they be optimized enough to run on a 1050? The solution isn't always a bigger pipe, in fact, it rarely is. That's the last thing you try to upgrade, mainly because you're *forced* to.

@_date: 2017-08-26 01:51:23


Siacoin actually solves this problem amazingly well and would use existing hardware and not require gigantic infrastructures. But, yeah, centralized trillion dollar infrastructures is better than decentralized mesh networks we're going to eventually have... wait.. if we're moving towards decentralization already.. would that maybe mean it's more efficient!?
Gov't, for example, forced the evolution of filesharing. Centralized systems can fail much more easily, they are not resilient. Bittorrent is almost entirely decentralized. If the search engines were decentralized, it'd be perfect.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:36:09


Literally, it's exponentially better. Not sure you're understanding what I'm saying.
Again, look at it this way: say a video game comes out and it **requires** 5mB/s download. What if somehow that game could optimize itself so it only requires 5kB/s! 1000x faster, and at **no cost increase to the end user!** 
That is called **creating value**, you aren't creating value when you increase the blocksize, you are adding more work for the end user.


Then you don't understand it.. it's relatively simple to understand until it branches out. You lock coins for some amount of time, anyone can broadcast a transaction appending a signature within nLockTime. At the end of nLockTime, transactions are executed... is my naive understanding... it's relatively simple though.. compared to something like organic chemistry.


Would you rather have cable TV or Internet? Because that's what we're talking about. Playing on some big corporations platform with few choices OR playing on a decentralized platform with many choices.

To improve anonymity it is sent to a new address and a new private key is stored in your wallet.dat. In the old versions, you had to backup your wallet after each transaction to keep these new change address private keys. In new versions, it seems like there is a queue of a few hundred (no idea how many) addresses to protect against this, so if you backup your wallet.dat you backup those few hundred addresses as well. In the old times, you didn't back those up as well.

I believe this isn't true. Do you "spend" your bitcoins? What if you could hold them, they accrue interest, and you loan them out to people to start their own businesses? 
The economy isn't driven by people spending all of their money paycheck-to-paycheck. It's driven by people with savings who invest (RISK!) that money for nice returns. Stock market? Bonds? Businesses? Who cares, these are the kinds of $$$ movements that grow the economy. People burning holes in their pockets don't.
Have you ever saved up money, started a business, paid employees, grown that business, and sold it? It probably took a fuckload of saving, cutting costs, etc. to get there -- if it takes 5 years, is inflation really helping you?
Big business/etc. want little guys to not be able to save jack shit. You can't get assets and holding cash is horrible... it's on purpose!

Money 2.0: Low/no fees, complete control
Uhhh? Just because some people are manipulating BTC right now to force high-ish fees and wallets aren't calculating fees efficiently... doesn't mean the underlying aspects of BTC aren't sound.
What if you compared email in the early 90s to now? "Sorry, can't email me, you need to get on the compuserve network first, they aren't connected." "Well.. this is inconvenient, there's no way this fledgling technology will grow by leaps and bounds!"
Another comparison is the first Nintendo vs a PS4. It takes time. 
Even right now I pay $16 to receive money from Europe for my business, within 10 business days. The same in BTC would be &lt; $1 and near-instant. Paying out to contractors takes days via the service I use. BTC would be instant.

Yeah, you pay "fees" seeding for getting the download originally. And yeah, the technology itself settles transactions for you. Basically, this is as easy as setting up a retirement account and adding funds to it.
(high fee is relative, btw -- I pay $16 each time I get paid from Europe to the US)

That's like the saying answer to game networking is to just get fiber. Well... yeah I could make the pipe bigger, or you could somehow make the protocols more efficient! After you've exhausted all of the protocol improvements you can think of, then the last (and most expensive) thing you can do is make a bigger pipe.

Yes! Have you ever run a node? If you don't sync for a week, you are downloading a shitload of information. And *everyone* has to have this information, so it explodes in bandwidth.
The best way to make more people play StarCraft wasn't to make everyone upgrade their Internet, it was to make the protocols/etc. more efficient. When we hit limits we need to up bandwidth, like for video/audio.

No. Teaching yourself, and being able to do that, is extremely valuable to the right companies.
The culture in most organizations is that you need a degree. Some organizations will disrupt this philosophy by hiring "lesser qualified" people who are capable of teaching themselves MIT material without an MIT certificate. 
The culture shift will happen, because it has to -- "free college" has been a fairly failed experiment.

You're half right. It's 2.7mb, approx, max, I believe. But, you only need 1mb of data to verify everything. The other data is extraneous. Still an improvement, especially because it unlocks more potential!
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:40:02


Because the solution already exists. 


Who cares about the price now or 2 months from now or 1 year from now? What about the implications of this engineering 10 years from now? You aren't looking at this correctly.
What if you *knew* the Bitcoin was going to be successful in 2010, because you understood the engineering and the network effect had started? Would it matter if the price was $5 or $10 or $100 from month-to-month? 
All that matters is you understand:
1. everyone you try to explain bitcoin to doesn't understand it is another person who didn't understand the Internet in 1995
2. these people do not need to understand it because BTC is a platform, just like they don't need to understand how YouTube scales
3. because of the insane profits involved, the problems associated with BTC being difficult to use will be solved... see: Gmail for email, Google for search, discrete GPUs for gaming, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:33:59




Oh, okay, phew, right -- it is exponentially better :) Increasing blocksize does little to stop the bottleneck from happening. 


Yes. It does. At a &gt; 400% cost increase...


Exactly! For **free!** And, it helps enable LN, which scales to infinite transactions. Stop worrying. You don't even understand LN, so you can't even evaluate what I'm saying ;)
We'd never get amazing FPS games with great graphics, without GPUs dedicated for matrix math/parallel processing. Imagine if we got the first generation of GPUs and said "Awesome! OK guys, increase the power and size of this exact framework/architecture. Do not ever try to optimize the algorithms within this device, just increase the size of it."

The fees are based on risk/scarcity/etc.
Fees will get low, just like lending on Poloniex, when things are safe. This is obvious. This is great, for everyone. It doesn't matter if the US gov't is running a lightning node, it has to adhere to the same rules.

What didn't make sense about that? Why does gov't having power over money scare people!? The USA has killed like a million Iraqi civilians...
A magical item with no central ownership and instant transmission, like a faceless nameless coin (Bitcoin) is an ideal commodity economists and philosophers have dreamed of for eons...
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:03:27


Right, but plenty of people want greater returns so they take the risk!
The point is: people don't have as much $$$ as they used to. Why? Why does it seem to get more centralized? How can *they* do that to *everyone*? Did Nixon ever wield gov't power against citizens? Could a politician/business man do the same -- maybe to hemp industry, banking, etc.!?
Inflation (like min wage) doesn't really help us.

If that didn't make sense to you, not sure I'd bother trying for a degree...?
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:19:42
Yes, if you can somehow rewrite history and not affect all subsequent blocks, then there's nothing you can do -- this wouldn't happen. However, this won't happen, because banks/military/etc. would be more interested in fixing it than we would. Before we even get close things like Lamports signatures and such will be in use, and all of bitcoin's history can be re-hashed in some newer format.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:09:28


I did...? What do you mean "use it for transactions?"


I did provide you with data, you're just not listening ;)
Here's the data: Lightning network can scale to infinite transactions. You make a transaction, sign it, and the next guy signs it... same size message as before.. and the next guy signs it, and on and on... same size... (from my understanding)
That's a *real* improvement. Putting a bigger graphics card in a computer is stupid. Putting a better one in is smart. Think for 2 seconds about this... you keep moving the goalpost..

Yes, we pay too much taxes. It still does not negate that 40% *do not pay income taxes.* It is a moral hazard that the majority can tax the shit out of the minority.

Relinquishing control of your intellectual property is a lot different than there being no way to facilitate storing money than giving it to someone.. until BTC.


Right, so what are you even talking about? If socialism exists within capitalism, and involves government in no way, and changes nothing about our current society... what are you even talking about?




But, Capitalism is necessary for socialism, to you? I'm very confused on what your point even is. To you, socialism isn't a political system and is in no way different from our existing system. Seems dumb.

Not if he helped make the art, came up with ways to have better stage presence that persisted after he left, added lyrics to songs, came up with melodies, helped form their "Signature Sound", etc. etc. -- in capitalism that's what would happen. In socialism the group would just vote him out and steal his work, since he relinquishes control to the group and accepts his fate.


Right. That's the point. The "group" doesn't determine ownership, private property and individual rights do. If you choose to relinquish your rights.. well..

Nope, you are just not understanding. You said: *"A group of employees making decisions about their company isn't central planning."* Which is dumb. What if there are 10k, or 100k employees? They have no idea and probably don't care about your needs.


AH! Like someone named Hugo Chavez?! Now I know you're trolling ;)
Very wise to give up control, yeah? Definitely capitalism... wait...

You are glossing over so many details. Let's get really, really focused here.


**How much is "shared?" Who is "everyone participating?"**


There are plenty of businesses like this. This can (does) exist in capitalism. Socialism says this is forced, so, how are the profits forced to be shared? How are you punished if you don't share?

This logic doesn't make sense in the computer world. You want exponential returns. Going from 1 to 4MB is not helpful.
Being able to store billions of transactions in that 1MB? *That* is a good return in computer science. That's what lightning networks do. That's an actual computer science solution to a computer science problem. The solution is often not to take up more memory and more compute power, it's to design smarter solutions.

Geez, so let's just make gov't even bigger, give them all of our money to distribute, and then that solves the problem of overly powerful oppressive gov'ts!? Wow, how has no one ever thought of that before!?


What is wrong about inequality? Our per-capita income has gone up like 6x since the 40s....... that's pretty insane.....

And he also said:


@_date: 2017-11-04 01:42:44


...there are enough laws that do that? That's already what gov't is for: stopping individuals from being harmed (protecting your negative rights). This leads into a discussion about law suits and such, which I'm not very informed about. I do know that gov't suits this role well, although there are certain problems with the current system (patents, pollution, etc.), that's what gov't is for solving.


Yep. That's why we have all of the amazing stuff we do and we live boring safe lives.
Let me ask you this: should gov't be able to make weed illegal? Why is weed illegal?


Corporation is just a group of people working together. There's nothing wrong with people working together. We need to be concerned about gov't not becoming powerful, but at the same time protecting individuals. We don't need to redistribute wealth to correct cosmic injustice.

YES! SO MAKE GOV'T WEAKER, DON'T CENTRALIZE ALL THE POWER AND MONEY WITH GOV'T! Sweet mother of Jesus! You guys, this has been thought through. "Sharing stuff" with everyone isn't effective.
Market systems work for 90% who are productive, but not the 10% who aren't and will never be. Negative income tax, not socialism, is a solution. Give people money (power) to **choose** their own services. Don't just give them public school, give them the $14k/yr per student that we're spending and let them spend it themselves.


Wow... inequality of wealth yes 10% of people pay 95% of taxes. Those 10% = ~10-30 million folks. That's not "a few" people with money. Not to mention everyone gets one vote, that equalizes things to a certain extent.
Centralizing spending power at the gov't level is the polar opposite of what you want. Think. This. Through.


No. The best way to "game" money from people is via gov't. Otherwise it's consensual transactions between people, not forced, so it's not as easy to get screwed.

Run a business, make it successful, hire people, fire people, you'll see why *everyone* having say in a business is bad. That's why it's great in capitalism where you can choose which system to be under, unlike socialism where you are a victim of the majority.

Right, in a capitalist society you have the freedom to do with your own capital whatever you wish. In a socialist society, you don't own the means of production -- everyone does.


Right, capitalism. Choice.


Yes. This whole premise is that businesses are unethical and exploit workers. That's the whole point of Socialism.

How do you not become a multi-millionaire if you are pretty successful and rise to that level? Are you prejudiced -- or rather -- do you realize you are prejudiced?


OK, so the root of all of this is gov't, we agree there. So why should gov't be picking winners and losers, it should just be protecting citizens. Why does it pick winners and losers? Because it can! If gov't didn't have as much power, and instead individuals had much more power, corporations would be more in check. For example, why is weed illegal!? It's definitely not to protect people.

If you want profit you have to take risk, if you have a portfolio worth $3 million and your investor spreads out all of the investments so you have many winners and many losers for 8% gains... you have done OK with that investment. You would be much better off just picking winners and getting 30%!

This is laid out in contracts way ahead of time. Again, if you had experience running a business, bringing products/services to fruition, and **most importantly** being successful enough to profit and feed your family + employ others: you would know people make the best decisions when they have something at stake -- when they are responsible for their own actions and outcomes.

EXACTLY! Gov't can't regulate this. The act of trying to regulate and makes things fair inherently makes them unfair; freedom is the fair way to go, and capitalism is freedom. A paternal gov't cannot be fair. See: gulags.
Please answer these questions, which should be simple:
1. How much is "shared?" 
2. Who is "everyone participating" in a business?"
3. Socialism says this is forced, so, how are the profits forced to be shared? How are you punished if you don't share?

Socialism = public ownership, because wealthy people exploit others (is the idea of socialism)
The actual reality is wealthy people, typically, have given a lot to society and *that's* why they are wealthy. The top 10% of tax payers, for example, are wealthy folks but that's **millions** of people, not some elite class that inherited all their money, ya child.

@_date: 2017-11-06 20:09:34


Yes I do. It's a system by which you give up your money to the collective to be shared more equally. You don't own your McDonalds (private property; means of production), everyone does.
If you are starting in a system with private property, where I own the McDonalds and you want to work there, how do we distribute ownership? Consensually =&gt; capitalism. Coerced =&gt; socialism. Unless you are starting in a system with 0 ownership, then everyone could own everything and wait... who gets to make decisions? Who gets to take the reward (profit) for taking a risk? What if no one believes in Bitcoin, and everyone owns the computers together, so they choose to not put effort towards furthering Bitcoin?


Nothing stopping people from doing that now, that's capitalism. Socialism is forced.

So you are saying it's *not* a political system to you -- okay -- but it has to be: *owned or regulated by the community as a whole*. If the "community" in this case is a business, then it is owned by even the janitors. So what if 80% of SocialistMcDonalds employees want to close my store because they feel like it?

Right, by the way you see "who created it" that means redistribute it which would have to be done by govt policy. Someone owns that McDonald's and the fryer you're using... the taking of that ownership and giving it to the fry cook is what would be socialist. We currently have policies like this right now! 
Capitalism means you would actually control all the value you create, which is consensually determined by markets. Which is what you keep describing. Capitalism is all about employee owned businesses, go right ahead!
You can keep capitalism and add a safety net with negative income tax. Keeps choice.

From them:


2. Funds are not frozen. Some payment channels are closed to us while new channels are being opened.
3. Bitfinex is not insolvent. In fact, completing the BFX Token redemption process on April 3rd has paved the way for us to retain a major accounting firm to audit our balance sheet. We are in active discussions with several candidates and expect an announcement on this by the end of this month. 
4. To the best of our knowledge and belief, neither Bitfinex nor any of its principals are being investigated for any crime of any sort, anywhere.
5. To the best of our knowledge and belief, no entity in the Bitfinex group is being singled out by correspondent banks. We understand that Bitfinex is a victim of correspondent bank de-risking, targeting money service businesses (MSBs) in general and “virtual currency” exchanges in particular.

Paying $0.001 per video would be no problem. You are, technically, paying at least something for the Internet. So divide up all your usage, it's costing $0.10/video (or whatever) per month to have Internet...

Well, yeah, that's what it means. But, further than that, I'm allowing you to argue that smaller entities (not just states) can/should be socialist. That's dumb. Relinquishing control to the collective isn't the answer.


Right, which isn't socialism since whoever owns the business is who owns it, even if that is a group of people (Corporation).


Right and communism is another flavor of socialism...


...uhh? re-word this?


...straw man, again. I'm willing to talk about the idea of "relinquishing control to the collective" in any context. Whether it's in a religion, corporation, state, etc. The individual is the strongest piece of the puzzle.

Why is it strange that when they "tun on" millions in USD streaming through their banks, that their banks have sudden concerns?


2. Funds are not frozen. Some payment channels are closed to us while new channels are being opened.
3. Bitfinex is not insolvent. In fact, completing the BFX Token redemption process on April 3rd has paved the way for us to retain a major accounting firm to audit our balance sheet. We are in active discussions with several candidates and expect an announcement on this by the end of this month. 
4. To the best of our knowledge and belief, neither Bitfinex nor any of its principals are being investigated for any crime of any sort, anywhere.
5. To the best of our knowledge and belief, no entity in the Bitfinex group is being singled out by correspondent banks. We understand that Bitfinex is a victim of correspondent bank de-risking, targeting money service businesses (MSBs) in general and “virtual currency” exchanges in particular.

If the package was damaged along the way (checksum doesn't pass) then you don't pay. The package can contain gold or dirt, Fedex just provides 
We're talking about separate things: delivering content and paying for content creation. The delivery is decentralized. If you want remediation (didn't like a movie), that's a totally separate service and the cost paid to the "delivery men" is a cost of doing business.

@_date: 2017-04-03 11:41:01
No, I'm saying it's the friction that's the problem. It isn't *paying* -- it's the act of being interrupted when you're watching something. 
If it costs $1/mo to "top up" your browser to browse some decentralized video website with no ads... that's worth it. If h3h3 and all the popular YouTubers make way more money there, the market will guide them! You pay by the second you watch the video, so the more content you watch and the more times you watch it the more the creator makes... 
Watch your favorite music video 100 times for $0.10/mo. Creator has 10,000 fans makes $1000/mo. 100,000 fans $10k/mo.

Yes, and as I mentioned in my other comments: they handled what was a horrible situation relatively gracefully. Along with all of the other stressful situations happening recently, like contentious hardfork.
When you get older you realize: it's not how people/companies/etc. behave when everything is perfect, it's how they behave when shit goes down. Bitfinex seems very trustworthy. They are following regulations and playing ball as best they can. 
It's easy as fuck to say "mtgox again durrrrrrrrrr!" but you have no evidence, at all... there's a mountain of evidence pointing towards Bitfinex's credibility....

As a software engineer, this is obvious to me, but let me explain: before you pay for anything it will be verified. Each chunk of data will be hashed and when it arrives it is compared to the hash, and only then will you pay for it. Obviously the system will handle this kind of behavior..................... just like BitTorrent already does............ you are listing out solved problem after solved problem!

By the way, what's your experience working with people in third world countries? I have quite a bit, even setting up bank accounts can be extremely difficult. What about shipping a harddrive to a remote place in Africa?

...what? I never said any of that. The wallet of the future does not exist today. LN wallets will not require full node, but ideally would be run with one. Watchtowers will have plenty of incentive to keep things kosher.




There's absolutely no reason there couldn't be similar services. Did cell phones come out with voice mail on the first release or was that an implementation detail added later?


Or like a cell phone.


**That is not a good criticism, because it's fundamental to the network and can be made much nicer over time with different implementations.** It's like saying computers won't ever become popular because keyboards suck for interacting with content, no one will *ever* invent a mouse! Fundamentally you need a way to input actions into the computer, it can't read your mind (yet), so is that a downside to computers?
LN wallets, just like the Bitcoin network, should become easier to use over time. It may fail, but it *will* become easy to use if it succeeds. Chicken or the egg, almost.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:58:49


Again, I am a big Bitcoin guy, but this isn't true *yet*. Bitcoin requires an Internet connection, for example. Gold does not. I think the context matters here. Like if you are in an always on world with no intermittent connection problems and no potential way for electronics to be damaged (no solar flares, no EMPs or whatever fanciful shit we can imagine) then sure. 
The nice properties about Bitcoin basically apply to all cryptos, certainly Litecoin for example. If Charlie Lee died it'd be leaderless just like Bitcoin, as well.


Err, not really. Even without ornamental or practical uses, Gold just as a form of money still obviously is more reliable than Bitcoin. 
I think the statement "Bitcoin is more reliable, easier to use, and a better money than Gold" will be true in so-many-years, but is clearly not true right now.
Maybe I'm just being a whiney lil bitch early in the week, but seems silly right now.

They pay the fees then mine them back.
To understand this you need context. Do you know what asicboost is? How much more money would you make as a miner if you could pump up the fees? What if you were also able to remove hashing power? These aren't really assumptions, but what lead up to the high fees. Why did the fees seem to "stick" at certain levels? There's one thing that leads to an assumption, but that's after many facts.

@_date: 2018-03-20 15:12:16
Eh, I think that's a weird way to look at it.
The question we're talking about: how much did the user pay for the transaction? The miners paid in electricity to find it, and were rewarded with Bitcoin. The miners effectively paid $x in electricity for 12.5 in Bitcoin.
The miners "pay" for the block reward while the users pay for the transactions. It doesn't matter if there are 0 or 5000 transactions, the miners still pay for the 12.5 reward. Seems silly if 1 block has 1 transaction to say that 1 transaction had a fee of 12.5BTC, assuming the 1 transaction already had a fee attached...
I think that makes sense.......
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:25:38
SE here... I think you're missing it. A fork **isn't necessary, because we haven't exhausted optimizations.**

Yes, the thing you created in your head is dumb. That is not what I mean. Lightning still runs on Internet, yes, but you can run your **own Internet!** How do you pay other people to route for you?

this is not a myth this is a very very studied topic in economics.. Gresham's law.
Bad money pushes out good money. For example, when you used to be able to pay taxes in tobacco, would you pay with the good tobacco or maybe the shitty stuff that got too much sun? You will always spend your USD if you have a lot of BTC, or should anyway. It's acting *against* your interests to not keep deflationary currency, so it really shouldn't work.
AGAIN, I love Bitcoin, I think it's new and can actually work even if deflationary like real estate. It's my biggest worry about Bitcoin right now, since it has scale via LN.

@_date: 2017-09-05 01:35:31


I don't think so, I know so... Google re-wrote JavaScript engines because they literally could not handle it! Google created Go! We made a device, because CPUs aren't fast enough, just for processing 3D/graphics.. called a GPU.
Why do you think we have smart phones and not brick phones, jesus-fucking-christ! The gains you get from optimization/good algorithms/etc. can make things **possible** that were not before. Like the beauty of LN being able to scale to infinite transactions.


Hurr durr, exactly, that's why LN and such 2nd layers on top of BTC are great -- we don't want or need all of that data. Which is another great reason why blocks don't need to grow.

Err, no, it's one person with the patent and access to ASICBOOST which doesn't work on segwit -- what are you talking about? There's no "assumption" there, those are facts. So given those facts, how would that person most reasonably act to secure their profits and continue making those profits?
No "collusion" needed, just people independently profiting and the most profitable way to do that is spamming network, moving people to BCH where you can still ASICBOOST/get a derivative on your BTC, etc. -- "assuming" someone wants to make the most money, that's one way they could do it.
What is ASICBOOST? Do you know? What is SegWit and why did people oppose it? Again, there is a *whole* lot of context you are missing.


Err, most every purchase of Bitcoin does not end up on chain, it's off chain (i.e. Coinbase). Very few people were actually doing transactions with the new coins they bought -- wtf would they be doing?
Transaction fees were up to almost $20-40... wouldn't they still be high right now if your premise was true? Bitcoin just doubled from $5k to $10k -- where are the high fees?

Your cell phone has to be on to receive a call. I wouldn't say that's a downside to a phone, that's literally how the transaction has to work. You need 2 people connected to a network at that time to send &amp; receive a call. You can't have 2 parties sign a transaction without them being online.

Which doesn't tell me much. I'm just curious about Warren's thought process, but he often doesn't disclose finer details.


..right... which is? That he doesn't understand them? But he doesn't understand Apple, either, so what did he understand? Not just that they are "hardware" there are plenty of hardware businesses he didn't invest in...
Apple makes amazing profit margins, like 40%... that's probably the simple reason? Not hardware vs software or understanding vs not understanding the product. He sees the profit margins and returns and that's maybe all that matters?

Paying for access to *what?* What is the Internet!? I think it's really important that you understand the Internet is just a bunch of relatively-simple-for-what-it-does rules. As long as you follow these rules you can participate. There's no reason you and your neighbors couldn't setup your own Internet and your own way to broadcast domain names, etc., and pay each other for resources via LN. Pay $0.000000001 penny to lookup a domain. Pay the same for a few bytes of data. Who knows.

These criticisms don't make sense. They have to do with implementation of whatever wallet you're using, not LN. A wallet can make the experience seemless. You won't even realize you are using LN..


Again, that is literally not a downside but how the network *works.* It requires 2 parties to sign, so necessarily you have to present your signature. When you send your coins to someone normally, they are not signing anything!
Not sure how to make this clearer...
Same downsides of a cell phone in this regard, meaning it shouldn't be that impactful for adoption because people need their phones powered on and ready to receive calls. People won't even realize they are using LN, just like they *typically* don't care if it's 3g, 4g, 5g, wifi, whatever as long as their text/call goes through.
Also, same limitations of a website. The website has to be *online* for you to request a page from it. Like, that's not a downside, that's how it works! "Yeah I don't know if the Internet will succeed, you have to be online to use it."

You could run a game on lightning network, you realize? As fast as you can send packets, you can flip contracts back and forth on LN. Play StarCraft with actual resources. Play with actual Magic The Gathering cards, verified, non-duplicable.
Maybe even one day something similar to LN and you can get fast enough to run Counter-Strike or similar, ***instead of paying an ISP you would be paying individuals to route your packets.***

As a Dev I disagree. This is why we make money. We're stressed out and responsible for this and we worry. Without strong project managers many engineers would never be finished with their projects. They worry so much they never finish the first module because they got side tracked on making code highlight perfectly. The ones who can do it on their own end up becoming project managers!
The point is, they are being a little too wimpy. This is probably why dev split anyway. If your first release doesn't have some bugs then you're probably too late to market.

No first you'd have to not mine for months, gaining nothing, presumably missing out of 50% of Bitcoin rewards during this time! Doesn't even matter, there is no incentive to do it... 
You short, one whale (because price is down) moves in, drives price up and up with low liquidity(!!!), then your margins are called and liquidity comes back while you're contributing to the pump. Why wouldn't someone counter such an obvious move? They can see the shorts and blow them up knowing they'll get squeezed
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:46:22
But, you are saying this is hugely profitable, why does it matter if it's $1k or $20k? Why don't people band together and 51% attack to make huge profits?
See why the price doesn't really matter? Your attack won't work now, just like it won't work if the price goes down further.

Your path to destruction makes no sense. The only actual way Bitcoin will die is if better tech kills it, or there's some fundamental flaw undiscovered. Regulation or network attacks hurt badly, but it's a gobal good/service so it's resilient to that.

Every bitcoin payment in the future, for a tiny fee extra, can open a payment channel. Wallets will do this automatically.
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:58:21


Constantly would be 100% mining power. 51% means 51%. It would, effectively, congest the network up so things go at half speed. People would bump confirmations from 1-6 to 10-20. Things would grind to a halt, basically, just like they did this last Dec. Also, during that time you are getting **0 fees** from mining, costing you tons of money. The incentives are properly balanced, as time has shown.
It will be fine, especially with Lightning Network being much more resilient.
Also, what happens with very low bitcoin liquidity and high demand? What's to say the demand can't be high even if base transaction speeds are rather low? Assuming Bitcoin has a much higher level of adoption, many people will want to buy "cheap coins" to spend later when the network is decongested, which it eventually will be, because "attacking" it just drains your funds.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:00:05

@_date: 2017-09-24 07:05:05

My point was something completely different: we don't know if they are selling on there or not....
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:54:41
 &gt; Oh but there would be no double spends. Again Alice sends to Bob. You let it go through. Once it does you send the same amount back (Bob to Alice). There is no double spend. And being the longest chain it will win out (than any that does not include it).


This would cost an insane amount, and is basically gambling -- you're betting on shorting the market, right? Well, with such low liquidity and only your own transactions going through, what if the price goes up? "Change your forging algorithm" -- this means spending millions more on mining longer... this is unsustainable. 
You even go on and on about how expensive it is to mine, and therefore execute this attack!!!


Also, this will be clearly visible on the blockchain! Whoever is perpetuating such an attack would lose many people from their pool and all of their credibility. Where's the game theory in that? We have to stick together in pools now to be profitable.
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:43:42

No no no! You could short BCH and control 85% of it if you were Jihan and fucking *print money* according to you, why don't they!?
@_date: 2018-07-29 23:10:15


But, you said, difficulty will go down... and I'm saying there are *plenty* of people who have basically 0 mining costs. Also, you're saying that hardware is basically maxed out already. Given all of that, your scenario makes no sense.. people will continue to mine, and there are no scary attacks with a large % of mining. If there is a large network disruption, people actually using Bitcoin will make sure to move their miners to the appropriate pools, because they want Bitcoin to succeed.


People prospecting on Bitcoin, and if you're saying miners are basically maxed out -- who else believes that?


Not if the chain has invalid double spend transactions!
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:34:19


have a stroke writing that out? Think I get what you're saying, though.
It has nothing to do with physical vs nonphysical. It has more to do with understanding the business model. So. What about Apple business model made Buffet want to invest? You put Microsoft Windows in a empty machine, just like you put Coke in an empty cup.

@_date: 2018-07-28 22:16:38


Yes there is? And why would anyone do that?


OK I said fundamental flaws would  be one way it dies, but what you are describing doesn't make any sense. It's anxiety. At best your attack would hurt bitcoin's perception a bit, big whoop? The basic point of Bitcoin is that it's a new feature of the Internet. It's not going away. I don't know how people don't understand that. It doesn't really matter what it costs, it matters who leverages it and how. Otherwise, some other coin will be leveraged and solve the problem's Bitcoin is meant to solve.
The reason Bitcoin isn't $1,000,000/coin right now is because it's not that useful. Just like the Internet wasn't nearly as useful in the 80s/90s.

Sure, and also costs quite a bit? Not really sustainable.

@_date: 2018-07-27 08:43:39
No. 51% attack just means you can put transactions that anyone else might not approve in the blockchain, like a double spend. These blocks are quickly overwritten by other parties. If you have 51% but you miss a block between the 6 confirmations, you will be busted. 51% attacks are not that scary, really.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:21:05

"Well, if all these people jumped off bridges, they'd die!" .. why would they jump off of a bridge? What's the game theory behind that -- who benefits? How does their family benefit? What about societies perception of them -- do they want to look stupid and useless, or valuable and competent? Do people want to be a doctor or con people all day? I think there are great odds people like doing useful things, and those useful things win. Shitcoins will always be around, but there is an actual purpose to bitcoin.


In case of what abrupt change? Can you give some figures? If 50% of hashing left right now, what would happen? Geez, it'd take 50% longer to find blocks... then it'd adjust after a few weeks (currently).... uhh....


How are difficulty adjustments not solved. What happened with bcash? They launched with a weird difficulty algorithm, didn't they? What happened when asics came out and everyone was mining on a PC?
Your argument: people will make Bitcoin slow for a period of time and drive the price down, so those people can short the market and make a killing. I think that's pretty stupid, and why wouldn't someone on the other side pump the market up when volume is low, only to unload when volume is high?
It's not unsolved, and if it were Bitcoin would already be dead
@_date: 2018-07-29 22:42:31


I expect them to continue mining and expect the held coins to gain value over time. 


Didn't you say 51% attacks are damaging? Couldn't someone easily do that to BCH?


You aren't saying how the network is unworkable......... I just said the solution would be to bump confirmations a bit. This doesn't even account for Lightning Network.........


Why would they do that? I would just sell my miners while they are still somewhat profitable and move onto something else. Why plan some insane/weird attack when the market could go the opposite way with low liquidity in the markets?!

**At that moment, maybe!** Again: miners specifically choose the cheapest locations and methods. Maybe even "free" i.e. via solar or gov't subsidy. It costs them nothing.


So? How is BCH secure vs Bitcoin's hashing power?


Then how are you now confident in the resilience of software?! Bitcoin is, literally, anti-fragile.


Attack in *what way?* Double spends on Amazon for 10 minutes until they bump confirmations? And it costs you millions in unprofitable mining? And Bitcoin price is *already low?* If you have bitcoin-only-miners you should be incentivized for Bitcoin to succeed, as we've seen demonstrated over and over again.

Right. What incentivizes that?
Isn't there much more profit and incentive to making Bitcoin succeed and getting the full value out of the miners?
If you can put $1bn into miners and shorting or put it into Bitcoin and growing Bitcoin for the longterm... what would you do? I mean, if you believe in Bitcoin and the technology, the answer is obvious. If you only care about price/making money shortterm, then the answer is obvious.

@_date: 2018-07-27 01:29:21

It's not like you need a new Internet pipe for YouTube and one for Google. You just make one channel onto LN and you have that much capacity to work with. Also, in the future, you will be able to make channels *within* LN with factories, greatly reducing their cost. LN can scale to trillions of transactions...
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:44:11
...huh? It would be easy af to move tons. You just accumulate however much a day over a long period of time. You don't *have* to send it all to the same wallet address. For all you know, Soros could be responsible for all the buying pressure. We have no idea.

.........what............. price discovery? Every bought a stock because it was cheap compared to its value?


...dude, what? I *can* get it, I have a 1070, I got a 1080ti (VERY good price) but it broke down -- I returned it and got a refund then went back to 1070 -- what is your point? What are you arguing? I'm saying fewer people will buy it at this price, even if they can afford it. This is true. Fewer people will buy it, because they aren't willing to pay a higher price.


Dude... you don't have a point.. you are saying $800 is the same as $1300 price wise for a GPU. You are saying it's exactly the same.


If the price is the same at $1300 and $800, why wouldn't it just be $1300? Why would newegg sell it cheaper?
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:59:11

Right....... why are you typing at me..


right...... you're not making any points, why are you explaining everything I already agree with or understand?

By default in most wallets addresses are deterministic and each receive is new... not rarely..

Are you serious? Imagine you had a candy bar and could infinitely divide it -- can you imagine running out of that candy bar?


Yes Bitcoin is more valuable than Gold because it can be divided more, transmitted instantly, not be double spent, etc. That's baked into the value of bitcoin. Making bitcoin further divisible makes it more useful, so adds value, sure.
What is your point?!? 


Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, hard to tell if you're trolling or not.

Huh, well if it was so valuable I think someone will get use out of it? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:44:17

@_date: 2018-04-03 18:15:27
How much money do *you* have? I don't waste $500. I have money *because* I don't waste $500. I can afford a 1080ti because I don't buy it 50% more than what it should cost. I don't buy a brand new car, I get one used. I don't get the best hotel, I get an airbnb. I don't get the game right when it comes out, I wait for it to drop in price (most of the time).
So. I save money, I have more money to do more things, and I don't buy things when they're overpriced "because I can."

....that's not what I'm talking about.
Literally, there is a limited finite amount of real estate and its value is deflationary. Regardless of the current bubble, real estate is "the same kind of value" as Bitcoin in terms of you own some property in real life vs digitally.
So maybe Bitcoin (right now) is more like real estate than currency. But, since it's programmable and highly divisible, maybe it *can* be a *new* kind of currency...

You should look in the mirror, understand your bias! He's not an investor because he doesn't understand it, and he shouldn't invest **because he doesn't understand it.** His stance makes sense. It's painful he doesn't understand, but it's not like he's "corrupt" like you're implying.

You said "I'm just saying" twice.... yeah, he's not. Listen to him talk about it for 5 minutes, he doesn't understand where the value comes from or how it's even mined. He thinks someone can make new bitcoins via altcoins and almost nothing separates them. He doesn't "get it."

Pretty sure there are plenty of places where you can live for $1-2k/mo (Singapore, Thailand, etc.) like a king. 
Not to mention, there are plenty of other opportunities vs risk: off $350k Poloniex lending rates, you make ~$350/day... put 1/2 on polo, 1/2 on bitfinex and you'll lose a little (bitfinex less rates) but you're protected from counterparty risk. Say everything dies down and you only make $100/day (not likely) and BTC price doesn't go up.... that's still $3k/mo which is OK living in a lot of places... and your initial 110BTC stays there, compounding!

If you don't understand by now why bitcoin is hard to use for most people, I can't help you understand.


That's the point! It's not really obviously harder to use than any other one, *but* when that new coin comes around it's going to smash BTC (potentially) like Facebook smashed MySpace. Imagine a coin with instant confirmations, no fees (somehow), easy programming language with tons of modules for behavior, predictable inflation rate that doesn't expire in 120 years, better governance system (unsolved currently), etc...

What's the distinction, and why does it matter? Uhhh...




***Why in the world would you assume otherwise? Of course this is what I meant and would like to discuss...***
You are missing some huge points, here. Multiculturalism, cultural marxism, political correctness, etc. are all in the same basket, as Peterson identifies it.


The source you approved of says otherwise, and supports Peterson's interpretation.............................
Why aren't we discussing what is meant when these issues are discussed, why are you so focused on where the words come from instead of what Peterson means? You haven't said *a single thing* convincing me that Peterson doesn't understand what he's talking about.
Earlier you said:


I feel like that'd take much less time than you re-explaining that "cultural marxism" (as a term) makes you uncomfortable. Let's, please God, talk about what Peterson means by cultural marxism (multiculturalism, political correctness) and how *that's* maybe wrong!!

...no. Don't buy shit you don't need. Stop with the victim mentality, don't be jealous of successful people.
Want a car? Save up 5k. Want a house? Don't blow your load on everything you want, get an FHA loan.
Please outline the scenario that is failing, that should be succeeding?
For example, say you start working when you're 15 and you make 5k in a year. You buy a car at 16. From 16 to 18 you save 15k. You use 7k to buy a 200k house. You live with 2 roommates from high school. They pay the mortgage..
Don't have a kid. Don't blow your load. Save.

Right, away from coinbase because they are capitulating? If there's a buy for every sell the coins are sitting still, sure, but there's probably an exodus of sorts happening..

There are huge reasons... are you kidding?!
**Off the top of my head:**
1. Hard to use
2. Slow transaction times
3. High transaction fees
4. Governance problems -- who runs bitcoin? Who makes the final say? Miners? Users? Banks? Government? It's supposed to be the community, but what does that *mean?*
5. Deflationary -- although I like this, some people don't.
You're pretty naive if you don't think Bitcoin can get facebook'd. Facebook can even get facebook'd.


Obviously not.......... the market cap is still tiny....

He's right... There's really no reason other than network effect for Bitcoin to be "the one."

Yep, depends on where you live. You can live certain places with a roommate and frugally, and other places eating out every single day for $1-3/meal. "Living like a king" is definitely subjective, to me it means you do whatever you want -- like eating out and not working -- not have whatever you want.

Because being jealous and taking money from productive people hurts the economy...
Why do we need to take money from people to help social issues? If the social issue is so important, why wouldn't people voluntarily put money towards it?

Life is unfair, **not capitalism.** 
Further, inequality is good. If everyone were the same in every way with the exact same skills, value, etc... we'd be robots. Free will and our natural entropy is beautiful. I'm a terrible athlete, but I am alright at programming and that has made me very wealthy. Should gov't correct the world and make me a good athlete, or competitive somehow?


People should be in control of what they earn, so: we need capitalism. People also end up in horrible situations, or we have problems that need to be solved as a group, so: we need socialism.
Both in their pure forms aren't good. Together they are the best system we have.

...what? How does it solve that? How is this better than using any of the other better social/task networking sites + regular BTC transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:34:34
Definitely possible. Live frugally. Get a roommate/girlfriend. Done... I've certainly lived like this.
Want kids? Want more? Hope BTC goes in value, because your initial 110BTC is still around. But, you can be in charge of your life, for the time being.

Almost anywhere. Global poverty levels are plummeting. It takes almost no effort to survive, in many places.

If you are saying "redditor" then that is a superset which can contain a subset of developers. Listen to developers. That's what we're both saying.

Multiculturalism is basically cultural Marxism.
By conservative I mean conservative, what does that mean to you?
It seems like you just made some whacky assumptions that Peterson has never said.
It's not authoritarian to have "culturally enforced monogamy." You don't even know what he means by that, I'm assuming?


Right, conserving their culture. Anti-multiculturalism. Nothing to do with race, in USA perspective, though. Especially since we don't have a race/ethnicity.
