Sweet. I do have a laptop which I keep airgapped so may be able to use that but I'd need to take the time to read Into it properly.
Thanks for the help and the heads up about DM's

Yeah that's a good point.  I know all of the seed words so banking on a typo so don't think it's too difficult a job. I  will reach out

He never replied to me a year and a half ago.

I'm gonna reach out again. Congrats on the recovery and thanks for the kick up the bum needed to try get those sweet magic coins back

I think between 800 and 900 USD.

I had looked into that before but I am not in the slightest bit tech savvy

Spoiler alert USD will have depreciated to be worth alot less compared to today.

Thanks for all your comments folks. herein lies the issue for mass adoption of crypto currency unfortunately. For people not tech savvy or perhaps vulnerable this is a massive hurdle.

Ah see this is why I'm so hesitant to try! Haven't sold any BTC through exchanges yet and I know I need to have possession of my keys for it to be my crypto. 
In an ideal world I may not need to sell any but if needs must I will try to weigh up the risk and reward
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:09:03
Wow thanks for that! Have only really looked into local bitcoins.  In UK so there are fewer options but still plenty to check out

Tesla for me three

Thanks. Won't be a massive amount in any case but have not yet sold any through exchanges. I think that is a sensible way of looking at it
