We will have wallets open very soon, and an exchange to follow too. Moving in the right direction.

You speculate on the platform like  anywhere else.

I know what you mean. We are going through a radical change in what we do. We’ll be an entirely different company in two years.

Correct, virtual funds to get an idea of the experience

I work for eToro in London. Glad the reception to the add has been very positive. Happy to answer any questions or face the hate :)
Just as an aside, crypto is not CFD unleveraged, nor is stocks or ETFs in most cases. We have wallets on the way and an exchange to come too. 
All going in the right direction.

Crypto is not CFD, only with leverage. Stocks also physical.

Regulatory requirements, standard in the industry. Some companies a lot worse

eToro are helping get the bitcoin and crypto message out there to the wider investment community. The more people they bring in, the more interest and the more purchases of cryptocurrencies in the real market.

I work for eToro. We are a fiat platform. You can deposit USD and convert to crypto instantly

Nice one! The guys at eToro have been involved with Bitcoin since 2011! Long before we actually added it in 2014 when liquidity was possible. 
Yoni has been all over it for years.

Do we know what caused it?

That's it! ;)
