I think that Bitcoin will replace the current form of government, and by the time states begin to try to ban it, the snowball will already be rolling downhill.


this doesn't make any sense.  Define what "destruction of Bitcoin" would entail.  You just reiterated how it is impossible to ban math...  People are waking up to the fact that state-defined money is a farce (and really the state too) (that's what I was alluding to and what you called me a "crazy anarchist" for)
You put far too much faith in the idea of the state "destroying bitcoin as money" because money is an invention of humanity, not an invention of the state.

***Don't read this if you haven't watched all eps***
those 'topics' are meant to be the message of a group of people in the story, not a message of the show itself.  The writer is alluding to the fallacy of that group's position.  Just look at the spirit of the scene when Darlene asks Elliot to get back in the game.

I beg to differ chuckymcgee


and here lies your problem, you need to look into this.


if it could it would already have done so, so if the current situation is your version of destroyed....  "It" knows that people realize the folly when government bans things, it actually causes the Streisand effect and some say that, in addition, the act of banning legitimizes cc even more.
Is there some reason that it hasn't destroyed cc yet?  Is it waiting for something?  please enlighten me

it doesn't help that our government demands tax payment in the form of the product of the banks/government circle-jerk.  They work together to "convince" people to trust its buying power, as opposed to tulips which was a bottom-up movement.
Without a state fucking the notion of money people would just use the most viable form of money, which right now would be Bitcoin.  And I don't think the government would even exist if there were an overpowering sane opinion held by the public causing people to use decentralized currency, and then there would be kings and queens and shit again, goodbye society as we know it.  Not sure if that would be better than the fucked up situation we are now in.

It's either satire or they're so bizarrely engrossed in their own bullshit that they're insane.  My gut feeling is that it's the former.

I think you overestimate the waning power of mind control.  People are waking up.

You can't ban math.

To play devil's advocate: I honestly didn't see fsociety as either good or bad.  The leftist agenda is meant to be the message of a group of people in the story, not a message of the show itself. The writer is alluding to the fallacy of that group's position. Just look at the spirit of the scene when Darlene asks Elliot to get back in the game.  You know, there are still some shows that draw attention to the bullshit, and I can see how it would be easy to miss the subtle trapdoor.
