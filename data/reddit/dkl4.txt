This piqued my interest as there aren't too many public Bitcoin plays at the moment.  
So I started Googling BITXF.
Five minutes of Googling indicated to me that :
* BITXF is based in Vancouver, BC 
* otcmarkets.com lists an SIC code for BTIXF of 5180 - Wholesale-Beer, Wine &amp; Distilled Alcoholic Beverages
* BITXF used to trade as RCFEF Rainchief Energy
* smallcapnetwork.com gives the following profile for RCFEF : Rainchief Energy Inc. (Rainchief) focuses on identifying for evaluation undervalued oil and gas assets for possible acquisition. On September 30, 2009, it disposed of two subsidiaries, Black Diamond Importers Inc. and **Liberty Valley Wines, LLC.** On December 30, 2009, it disposed of Point Grey Energy Inc. In October 2010, the Company acquired JayDoc Capital Corporation.
* Per otcmarkets.com, BITXF has a market cap of $27.3 million.  Balance sheet data as of Dec 31, 2014 showed assets of $14,000 against liabilities of $471,000.
Then I stopped Googling.

How does this compare to Factom?

This was discussed a couple months ago at the MIT Bitcoin conference.

Amazon's 10-K filed 30 Jan 2015 stated the following :
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card
when redeemed by a customer. If a gift card is not redeemed, we recognize revenue when it expires or when the likelihood of its redemption becomes remote,
generally two years from the date of issuance.
So there is a fair amount of unredeemed Amazon gift cards floating around out there.

Vanguard is showing a quote for GBTC, but I got the following error when entering a limit order :
*Buy orders are not permitted for this security at this time. Call us at 800-992-8327 for more information.*
Right now GBTC trading is very thin and totally divorced from reality, so I'm not losing sleep over it.  If GBTC trading ever becomes more viable I'd probably start pestering Vanguard about it.

I have essentially the same question.  What is "Plan B" for the government in case either Factom or Bitcoin's blockchain disappeared or became inoperative.
I'm guessing if the blockchain "broke down" as of tomorrow, someone could pull information out of it just by running a node with data (blockchain) right before failure.
Is all (or "enough") of Factom's code open source so one could tease out pertinent information from the blockchain?

USAA serves active military, many of whom are overseas, Bitcoin may be a good way to provide financial service to folks in places as varied as Japan, Afghanistan, Germany, Kosovo, Qatar South Korea and the like.

I saw the following definition of a "money service business" from msb.gov :
Your business may be an MSB (Money Services Business) if…
The business offers one or more of the following services:
 * money orders
 * traveler’s checks
 * check cashing
 * currency dealing or exchange
 * stored value
The business:
Conducts more than $1,000 in money services business activity with the same person (in one type of activity) on the same day.
The business:
Provides money transfer services in any amount.
Of course you'll want to look at relevant state regulations as well.

Here's one article which discusses tactics used to control discussion in a forum.
* "Forum sliding"
* Inoculating the Public Against the Truth
* Turning a News Group into a Gossip Corner
* Collecting Information on Forum Members
* Identifying Violent Forum Members
* Gaining Full Control

Part of my background is in journalism, and in 1995 my alma mater invited me to a semi-private dinner with a major newspaper publisher.  I had just finished grad school and was trying to make a living (somehow) on the web.  When folks at the table asked me about my job status, I mentioned I was self-employed and trying to make it on the web.  They just laughed.  Granted, their laughs were justified for a few years, but they're not laughing now.

I agree.  At least in the developed markets (DMs), I've never thought Bitcoin could make much of a dent by being "better than credit cards".
There are a couple niches where Bitcoin makes sense in DMs ("tipping", adult content, contraband) but these won't drive mainstream adoption.  I use Bitcoin frequently to make small contributions to software projects and the like because it's easier (no credit card number input etc.), but again, this won't drive adoption.
I think Bitcoin adoption as a payment will spread in DMs over time, especially among youngsters.  If you're a 14 year-old kid in a DM, Bitcoin is one of the few ways for you to buy stuff online etc.  As these kids grow, they'll take Bitcoin with them.
In the DMs, bitcoins may well become a good store of value, especially if we see much in the way of negative interest rates.  Even the US Federal Reserve is talking openly about negative interest rates.  But here again, it's about holding bitcoins, not transacting with them.
But the Emerging Markets (EMs), especially those with crappy currencies, bitcoins make more sense, both as a transactional vehicle and as a store of value.
But, there's a very good chance bitcoins may be used under the covers for all kinds of transactions.  It seems like Coinbase and Circle are beginning to keep "dollars" but sidestep the ACH system, courtesy of Bitcoin.
In this case, it'll be like Linux.  Few consumers knowingly use Linux, but almost everyone uses Linux daily (Android, Google.com, Facebook.com, set top boxes etc.).

Just by looking at the investors, I'd say Bitreserve is looking at Mexico as being a major market, while Circle will focus more on China.
At this point, there should be room for both.

Yes, I suspect at least part of this is to thwart money laundering through "fake" mining enterprises. It seems like one of the corrupt federal agents in the Silk Road case set up a phoney mining company that was likely intended to launder his ill gotten bitcoins. "Ah... the bitcoins came from my racks and racks of mining rigs... yeah that's it..."

I really have no background on this, but a quick Google turned up this paper :
"Bitcoin over Tor isn’t a good idea"
The paper describes privacy and security issues with "Bitcoin over Tor".
Any comments on this?

A couple more things on "integrator at scale".
I'd say that the majority of Google's $400+ billion market cap comes from Google's AdWords and AdSense services which are built on HTTP.  These services enable matching of users, advertisers, and content providers.  You'd think something analogous could be built on top of Bitcoin.
Also, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a fairly robust and dynamic spot marketplace for EC2 compute instances.  Using their API you can watch the going rate for compute instances, and farm out jobs when the price is low.  This is run within Amazon's "walled garden", so again, you'd think something could be built (like Storj, MaidSafe) using Bitcoin for metering purposes.

JPMorgan Chase is a key part of the Federal Reserve system, which is essentially a cartel.  Although most cartels don't work well because of "cheating", the Fed's cartel works quite well since it's rules are enforced with the power of law.
It's been a successful business plan for over 100 years.

The American Revolution (Lexington &amp; Concord) started when British soldiers were sent to seize weapons stored by Americans at Concord.
So yes, Americans and Brits historically have seen the right to bear arms issue differently.

Bitreserve says they have quarterly outside audits of their financial assets.  I heard on a podcast that their auditor was PWC, but I think they may rotate auditors.
They also say they have daily audits of their precious metals by "GBI’s approved vaulting partners."

I just sent you a bit of btc to your address listed under "Configuration -&gt; Contact".  
If you're not a Bitcoiner, I don't think people would understand the string of letters.  It might help if you prefaced your address with something like "Bitcoin: 1234...".
I'm not saying you're out to grab btc, but it'd just help everyone understand and maybe bootstrap the "ecosystem" a bit.

OK, thanks!  I just got a ChangeTip account.  Lemme try to return a bit to you...  75 bits @_date: 2015-02-23 17:31:08
