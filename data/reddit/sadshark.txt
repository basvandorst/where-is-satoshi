Ok, well thought out response and makes me understand its value a little better. I can see that people put value on the things you mentioned and I agree to some extent. So, thank you for clarifying.

One of my friends just invested $300k in GTX 1070s... how fucked is he?

He paid around $900 per card. One 6 card rig costs him around $5600.
After reading your commend I realize he's not fucked. He's royally fucked.
Thanks for crushing the numbers.

By the end of the week?! By the looks of it... by the end of the day.

You still haven't answered the question of where does its billions of dollars value comes from. In your example gasoline is used to power cars etc, that's value. Groceries feed people, that's where its value comes from. Where is the billions in value for Bitcoin? It literally has zero value in real world applications (except for the few shady deals where it's used, but in everything else fiat is way better).

You're missing my point, buddy. I know it's a legit coin, I know about the technology behind it. While the coin inherently is legit, its value is massively inflated and the people who got in early are making mad bank while the people who got in late either make few dollars or lose a lot of money. See the similarities to a pyramid scheme? It's not the coin, it's the people.

It was always worthless. Give me one example where bitcoin actually has billions of dollars in actual value and not just based on speculation. Like where does bitcoin have value from? It's like one big pyramid scheme.

What if there's 1 million of those $100 sellers?

And this is why bitcoin will never be more than a get rich quick or get poor quick scheme.
