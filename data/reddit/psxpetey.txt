Best thing you can do is make your own political parties and get on tv. And just start governing yourselves. 
Rioting and destroying property will just get you killed as they are more than prepared to kill you. You either need weapons or a different approach. Because violence is where you are headed so you better stock up. They’ve already announced they will use live ammo, confiscated bank accounts illegally and much more.

I’ll do it in the morning but like I said I’m a noob so I couldn’t tell you what x Bitcoin was anyway. I’ll have to bring a calculator. Bit silly tho having to do that. I will report back tomorrow
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:43:21
how somewhat hidden is it because its not in my receipt
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:52:38
It was fucking 12,800 and bitcoin is 11,400 ish WHAT THE FUCK
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:19:35
Also since they are scammy what can I use to get that 1 dollar fee because 80 bucks just isn’t feasible to use bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-11-29 01:26:48
you shouldn't have to do that though. they are ripping people off. I don't have to bring an app to make sure my atm is giving me the correct price of cash lmao. no wonder bitcoin tanked at 20k. all the negative press from people trying to put money in and losing like 20k because they didn't check the price of bitcoin s they were putting money in the atm. one guy in Canada lost even more than that just putting it in an atm because he was a noob. then of course it tanked and people lost half their life savings lol.
woulda been sweet if I new about bitcoin when it was 1 cent tho lol.
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:51:38
Figured out where it went they were charging 12,800 and the current worth of bitcoin is 11,400 it was a local coin atm. Fucking scammers wish I checked the price of bitcoin before I went.
@_date: 2019-11-15 03:33:10

@_date: 2019-11-15 01:15:36
That’s crazy is there a way to choose speed of transaction at the atm ure right that is so greasy
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:55:56
He said it was a troll account I assumed this was the alt account
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:39:52
When you think about it 300 is pathetic world wide. Probably 300 in your county

“Talking about it”
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:05:33
Opsec bud doesn’t need to know your details to give away your ip. You use your phone for email reddit Facebook twitter all that and if your ip is using bitcoin as well then it’s easy to track
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:47:07
Unfortunately I don’t own any bitcoin yet that’s why I’m asking dumb questions
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:33:11
ill give that a look I was considering multibit  still googling how they work thanks for the alert about electrum being preinstalled.
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:36:22
Mafackas losing their minds about this when Epstein  buys and sells children for heads of state to fuck and had a whole pedofile island and was killed in prison to shut him up. Priorities people
They care more about a rude president than some of the biggest crimes in the modern world
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:10:22
Member when it went up to 20 and every retard on earth bought so many 1080tis they went up to 2 grand in price and then after it dropped they sold the cards for like 400 bucks? I memba 
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:38:36
What type of hardware wallet and in terms of opsec how would I transfer funds to people and stay anon. Is there some site people use?
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:36:13
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:31:53
It also amazes me that : “Epstein didn’t kill himself” comments sprinkled here and there is the sum of all effort people are willing to put into this.
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:10:35
I’ll have to look into it but when I first saw it I didn’t like the peer to peer idea
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:11:39
Well if you want to be really sneaky you buy a comp for that sole purpose use encrypted email and transact at cafes and libraries also ure tor and maybe tails

@_date: 2019-04-23 22:25:41
well only so anon that it doesn't cause me obscene amounts of effort. I'm not going to build my own laptop and sit outside a coffee shop in an unmarked van out of view of every camera, bounce my traffic all round the world i'm not a 3rd world war criminal on an international wanted list selling coke lol.
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:49:13
ya that was my plan buy with cash.
I could only imagine, what if there were cameras in the area of the atm lol? samurai seems like it has some similiar features to ethereum which also has similiar features to multibit.
whats the farthest down the rabbit hole you can think of?
paper wallets may be a bit farther than I need to go
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:22:26
the atms here dont allow character entry i mean could just print a peice of paper witht the qr on it or use a old phone and turn wifi off
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:02:54
Local coin
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:07:35

Need any special software or is it just literally writing down a code on paper
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:45:28
First of all you take things too seriously second of all your arrogant enough to think I’d pay you for anything.

Tried 5 it worked weirdest thing ever. Put in 5 and everything went away then I clicked buy bitcoin again and it showed the amount I put in and I could click buy and it finished my transaction. So it ques up.
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:31:35
how does that work i have tails on usb
@_date: 2019-04-26 09:24:59
I’m well aware
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:30:46
how much would you want
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:04:00
I’m going incognito hence I’m not using a bitcoin app. Why would I buy bitcoin for cash otherwise lol. I just don’t want to put in 1000 bucks and have them tell me too fuckoff when there is an error the markup is bananas so that makes sense. How could it likely be user error tho u show a qr code you put cash in boom done
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:09:46
I know that’s how bad the fomo was.

Why I tellin me I don’t mine. Why didn’t they do that ? Fomo then they sold to cut their hilarious losses. 
I was listening to a podcast where a guy lost 250k on top of his tech mining purchases be nice if it kept going but you have to use your brain too
