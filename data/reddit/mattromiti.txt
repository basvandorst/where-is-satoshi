Here are the 3 transactions OP is talking about:
If you take one of the input addresses 1MvYASoHjqynMaMnP7SBmenyEWiLsTqoU6 you discover it's Huobi.

Would you be able to allow us to find (or also tell us) the tx hash you are talking about?

See my other [comment](

I'm not able to find any tx with total input &gt; 1800 BTC (\~$13M) that has many inputs (at least 1800/50=36 (50 is the max block reward)).
I'm happy if somebody can prove I'm wrong.
Edit: within block 604400 (2019-11-18 21:27) and block 604800 (2019-11-21 18:08)
Edit 2: it was not one tx, but three. Huobi is the miner.

Interesting work. Good job.

It shows or at least tries to show that people are actually paying in Bitcoin and scammers move it sometimes to known entities like exchanges. In addition, we recently discovered that some sextortion money was received by the same entity that was among the outputs of the [Binance hack]( (the paper was written before we had the data from the hack.  (I'm one of the co-authors)
I would expect that somebody, sooner or later, knocks on the door of some exchange and ask for details of these scammers.

Is there a BTC address in the email?

There is no transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain with an input of 2500 BTC (+- 10BTC) if we consider the last 1008 blocks (the last 7 days roughly).

The input addresses are gocoin and they receive from vivigle.

Some BTC has reached exchanges, probably. From the initial transaction [ you have 3KfKiJT5vNAdsmCLVXagSm9GKtiQRsYxEo which sends BTC to 1PP2RszGu9A9UZni8B2RRrBAFsKfjYXuTa which is associated with Bittrex. There are many other examples. Some here:
1) 3AoRjdkUFE4nfRtArRC8r1MnUjUPmuLdDP to 1LpDsjJUDWD3YcxaeL5RDN4sXyiVzrpruA associated with [Huobi.com](
2) 3AoRjdkUFE4nfRtArRC8r1MnUjUPmuLdDP to 3R1a2ir6CNPUXVR5tcNV1guyG7sQoWhV2i to 1HAntism3L6FFsGx3cU1YqYbJVAveF9SPF associated with [Luno.com](
3) 3MpKfZZyf44myybX3M9y1sTKS5Mrs7e5JF to 1HV8F1AKtBpusLuMYTDtVoYUW7xBmBX3Hw to 1JA4PeJER52W3HLSUBd6WJ2DkZWNXi2v1T associated with [Poloniex.com](
Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

Nice and interesting work. Could you provide the depth-4 image in a nicer way? I'd like to copy-paste addresses. By expanding the tree here [ I get many more nodes and I wanted to check some addresses with your graph (I'm aware you are filtering out &lt; 1 BTC).
