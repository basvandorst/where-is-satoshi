That's true for either a commodity or an inflationary currency. Bitcoin has both commodity and deflationary currency characteristics. Basically, you can't suppress the price of bitcoin the same way you could with gold because bitcoin has a few properties gold lacks such as counterfeit protection and privacy. No one is able to pay for a coffee using an ETF.

In a sudden spike, especially when tethers printed at the same time, yes its plausible. Its certainly not outrageously crazy to see a correlation.

What if the wave pattern is short long long short long long? Does institutional trades affect prices?

You're right it would change the chart by a lot but it is known as a statistical outlier. That data is irrelevant because its not apples to apples with the majority od the data set. We want to compare market exchange prices with itself, and not price quotes on archived forum posts.

What if etf approves and btc shoots up to 40k and then falls to 10 does the model change? What is the degree of error? On the tolerance range, is this more conservative or liberal (political jokes aside for just 1 thread please)? How cerrain are we that wave 3 isnt supposed to be longer? What else can this model be accurately applied to?

The time it takes to win a block is averaged and paid out to pool miners. You might not have enough years left to live to mine a block to yourself, but with a pool at least youll realize the earning potential today

Dont count on it. It is decidedly so. Signs point to yes. As i see it, yes.
If we plot this 1 negative and 3 positive answers on a graph, we get an upward slope, which means buy more today.

If everyone saved, and no one spent, what would that do to a countries GDP? Obviously after a certain point people would cash in to buy lambos, but until then the country as a whole is suffering (assuming an entirely crypto country). Gold doesnt have the gains like crypto does. Gains that could stop everyone from working hard and spending it on each others businesses. We would all be doing free things, eating minimally (a good thing) and spending only what we need. Actually the more I write about it, the better it sounds.

Their concern about price manipulation should be clarified. Its not whether a particular exchange owner/admin could change the last trade price with bots and limiting deposit/wirhdrawals. It's about where the currently 17,000,000 bitcoins are allocated. For all we know 5,000,000 could be owned by a small group of people within a state government. What if somebody just dumped a whole bunch of bitcoins at once, and removed tether from all the exchanges. That would obliterate the value of bitcoin overnight, and with an ETF and heavy investment into it, the USD at the same time. With a big dent caused by 1 million dollar bitcoins, plus every retail investor had life savings in the etfs, that would erase a lot of peoples wealth, people stuck hodling and the ones who FOMO'd their life savings in, and these huge wannabe miner companies (they're wannabes because they dont mine nearly as much as the mining equipment manufacturers). Sure a few made it rich on the run up, but the system would implode, causing a shift in the global super powers. This just a theory but it's why the SEC is so hesitant about approving the ETF which could add fuel to a fire that might burn more than we want it to.

You must be new to bitcoin. Welcome! MtGox was the first market to manipulate the price using two bots.

Lets say the ETF goes through, and both retail investors and wall street invests heavily into bitcoin ETFs. 
If a corporation with close ties to a government had the ability to dump millions of bitcoin on the open market, could they put a serious financial dent in the system? A corporation that perhaps manufactures mining equipment and runs "testing" phases for years on the latest models, before selling the inefficient old models to the public, for example.
What if these same people had the power to remove tether from all the major exchanges, what would the vacuum of tether do to the price of bitcoin?
I know everyone wants an ETF to happen because the hype will drive the price up. But if every bitcoin was worth 1 million dollars, multiplied by investment in other financial instruments such as an ETF, that is a DEFINITE investment (to an even greater magnitude) into something we think MIGHT be decentralized.
Unlike Gold, bitcoin is designed to go up in value. Its not apples to apples in terms of economic security; if we heavily invested into bitcoin it could disrupt our current society if an advisary controlled most of the bitcoin. How are bitcoins made? Where do they come from? Does anyone control most of the bitcoin hashrate? If they do, how much bitcoin do they have? 
This is why the SEC has rejected the ETF so far to date. Not because they're jerks, or they're old antiquated men. Their concerns are real. Bitcoin doesnt need an ETF to go up in value. An ETF would just add fuel to the fire, a fire that could heat up marshmallows or catch fire to your home.
TL;DR who is holding all the chips?
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:24:33
No its not like Bezos because bitcoin is not a corporation that can elect a new director and continue business as usual even after the dump. Read bitcoins whitepaper it operates under an incentive program to secure the network. It was meant for random people all over the world to secure it but it didnt address the underlying problem that people pay different prices for electricity. Who ever can pay closest to 0 for electricity and has cheap labour to build the equipment will have the power to control bitcoin. Combine decentralization with an ETF and you have a bezos who can liquidate all of amazons assets and walk away with the cash, WITHOUT any penalty because we don't know who he is or where he is.
