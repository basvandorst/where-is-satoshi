We built [MooCoin]( to do exactly this. Some games will trend toward luck, and some toward skill. The games are player vs. player, but we also have some bots to play with if there aren't people on the site at the moment. We also have a faucet so you can play for free. Maybe the most unique aspect is that we allow other developers to create games on the platform and share in the revenue. More games are coming, but check out the ones we already have.

I hope you enjoy this sequel to [Rain.BitSonata.com](
- The background ambience represents the hashrate (though they are not linked).
- Stars are placed based on transaction velocity and size.  They are joined by Tibetan Singing Bowls.
- A Tibetan Deep Chant signals a new block on the network.
There's also a link to my other project, MooCoin.

Great idea.  Done!
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:46:40
Done.  Great suggestion - thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:45:15
Thanks for the tip!
I'm doing a more relaxing one now.

Check out  to hear what it sounds like when 180k bitcoins moves around the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:19:30
Working on it right now.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:28:52
It's not useful - just a database id.  I'm going to remove it to avoid confusion.

The website connects to the Bitcoin network and watches for new transactions and new blocks to be mined.
Whenever it sees a new transaction, you see and hear lightning and thunder.  If the transaction was small, you get a minor sound/visual.  If the transaction was large, the sound/visual is more significant.  Whenever a new block is mined, the wind howls.
Down the right side are the realtime transaction amounts and block numbers as they hit the network.
In the end, it's just a cool way to experience in real-time what's happening on the Bitcoin network.
I hope you enjoy.

Thank you for the tip!
I'm working on fixing the loop gap right now.  Unfortunately, browsers don't support gapless looping, but I think I've found a trick that will make it sound gapless.
I'm glad you enjoyed it, and I hope you like the upcoming improvements.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:02:43
Noted.  I'll remove them immediately.

I'm about to launch a website that shows companies the value of accepting Bitcoin by providing them pledges from consumers.  If you want to make a difference and increase the acceptance of Bitcoin, come make a pledge here:  
Right now, I have a few for-profit companies as a proof of concept, but I'm happy to add non-profits if the site gets traction.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:21:38
Totally.  I'll do that now.  Great idea!
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:22:12
We're using testnet coins during this pre-launch tournament to help us test the site without putting any players' BTC at risk.
Whoever is at the top of the leaderboards on Jan 23 @ 11:59pm GMT wins .2 BTC each (real, mainNet btc).
Then, we'll donate the testNet coins back to various faucets and switch the site over to the mainNet for launch.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:23:14
Each time you make an anonymous pledge, we email two competing companies and let them know that whoever accepts Bitcoin first wins your business.
Imagine working at the H&amp;R Block and getting an email saying that there are 8,500 people each pledging to spend $40 filing their taxes for a total of $340,000 if you accept Bitcoin...unless TurboTax gets there first.
Come help us accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:21:32
I'd love feedback, as well.  
What themes would you like to see?
What aspects of the blockchain could be visualized?
What controls would you like over the experience?
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:50:14
An undersea theme would be cool.  Probably less "evil", too :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:19:14
I've scaled that back.  It's now sending a daily summary with the day's results, and the total results.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:28:02
I just did a quick first pass so it's useable on mobile.  Thanks for the heads-up.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:25:04
Yes - this is an alpha launch to see if we get any love.  It looks like we are  :)
We're make it more responsive to mobile devices very, very soon.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:21:52
I agree.  I tried to grab acceptbitcoins.com, etc, but most everything I could think of was taken.
I did register adoptbitcoins.com at the same time and will use that domain when reaching out to companies.  Both will lead to the same site.
I know it isn't perfect, but the situation will continue to improve if we get some initial traction  :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:58:54
Do they have a competitor?  If so, I'll add them to  to help them understand the value of accepting Bitcoin for their business.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:14:32
Nothing, yet.  I'm thinking about making them random colors based on hashes of the last block or something, though...
Maybe have the density based on the hash rate?
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:05:00
Done.  Thanks again.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:44:29
Me too!  I remember sitting as a boy in the garage with the door up and watching the rain and listening to the thunder.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:56:35
Right now it's disconnected from the blockchain.  Eventually, I'm going to vary the pictch based on the overall network hashrate.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:18:38
Because individuals rarely ask businesses to accept Bitcoin.  When they do, it's a one-off request to potentially a different person in the company each time.
When thousands of people all raise their voice in a unanimous chorus calling for acceptance to the single, right person in the company, you get a different result.  Especially when you know that same chorus is reaching the ears of your competitor.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:53:46
Whoa, thanks!!!
My first tip, and she's a whale!
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:03:59
The ListenToBitcoin domain was sold to someone that had malware on the site.  
The original creator then started BitListen as a more trustworthy alternative.  His work also inspired these two audio-visual experiences tied to the realtime Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:10:31
Ya know, you spend a bunch of time getting something online, and there's always something that slips by.  Thanks for the heads-up.  It's fixed now.  :)

Also checkout  for other visualizations of the blockchain.  It was cool watching the stars on  when the 180k transaction hit  :)
 
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:24:11
Can you verify that's the case?  It's only supposed to dole out .000001 btc.  I don't see anything in the logs that indicates it's giving out more than that.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:13:56
Right now, the plan is to answer high-level questions and then refer businesses to a Bitcoin processor.  
I view PledgeBitcoins as a way to let consumers to leverage their collective voice to show businesses the value they can capture by accepting Bitcoin.  That may change as things progress.

Quick update on the leaderboards and the **1.2 BTC** prize:
- **PUB05fad62f6a17** is on track to win **0.6 BTC** for leading the *"High Roller", "King Midas", and "Someone has to Win"* categories.
- **PUB44b7ad187c46** is leading the *"Grind it out"* category and will win **0.2 BTC** unless someone stops him.
- **PUB33ea5ec6f8e6** *"Cant' catch a break"[/i] and will win **0.2 BTC** unless someone else proves as unlucky.
The big opportuninty, though, is the **"Get rich while you sleep"** category.  Currently getting just one referral would put you at the top of that leaderboard for **0.2 BTC**.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:05:55
Come give [MooCoin]( a try!  We're running a free tournament right now on testNet, so there's no risk.  We'll have 6 winners who take home 1.2 BTC.
Oh - and we show you your deposits instantly, then wait for 4 confirmations before you can play.  But that's cool, because while you wait you can play with our money using the built-in faucet.
We don't have poker yet, but we do have a couple of fun games you can play head-to-head.  Maybe the best part is that we've built an open platform where other developers can use our API to create cool games, and share in the revenue those games generate.
Sound pretty cool?  Check it out:  
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:24:21
Ah.  Fixed!

We plan to move off the testnet on Jan 23, at the end of our beta tournament.  There's a lack of information about the intent of TestNet, so it's good to hear discussion about it.  I hadn't thought of using an alt-coin for the beta, but wish I had.
The intent was for us to run on the mainNet, but we wanted to have real users play on the site for a while as a live beta without them putting their own coins at risk.  We limited the beta to a 2 week period, after which we're putting all of the coins back in faucets and moving our site to the main net.
If this violates the intent of the testNet, I sincerely apologize.  TestNet has been a huge benefit to us during our internal testing and we didn't realize that the line was drawn between internal and public tests.
I'll look at what it would take to move the accounts over to an alt-chain.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:51:05
Great idea.  I'll absolutely roll that in.

...and I'll share my favorite testnet quote from TP's faucet page:
"Please remember - don't hoard TestNet coins or try to sell them. TestNet coins are worthless, but useful. They are useful because they are worthless. If you will add value to them, they will be useless, therefore worthless."
You know you're a geek when you have a favorite testnet quote...
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:33:43
Yes - Right now I just picked three companies to see if the concept could get traction.  Now that I've seen such a positive response, I'm going to allow user-submitted pledges.

What's different about this one is that we're leveraging two competitors against each other.  The hypothesis is that there's a difference between working at Amazon and hearing:
"Hey Zappos, I'll buy shoes from you if you accept Bitcoin"
"Hey Zappos, I'm going to buy shoes from either you or shoeBuy - whoever accepts Bitcoin first"
@_date: 2014-01-17 02:45:19
Yep - after 4 confirmations, you should see the funds in your mooCoin account.
Just to make sure we're on the same page...These are testnet coins and have no value.  
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:22:29
Definitely!  Look for this and in-game chat in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:25:12
We're running a different kind of petition on  . You pledge to support one of two competing companies.  We send emails to both competitors letting them know that whoever accepts bitcoin first wins your business.  We never share your contact information with the companies.  
Go make some pledges!
