If you ever do consider doing this in earnest, get a lawyer, seriously that sounds trivial but the a lot of people don't even bother with getting their TOS written by a lawyer.

What, if anything, will this do to the anonymity of bitcoin?

For this situation it might be acceptable (unless it could be considered plagiarizing? Can one plagiarize a legal document? This is what the lawyer is for.) but I would still recommend a lawyer looking over it.

Off topic (sorta), but this seems like a good way to contact you guys. I am a bit overwhelmed by your site. I am in the market for this stuff and willing to spend around $500-$700-ish and I don't know where to start. What are these things? Why do I need them? How do I set them up? How do I know what i need for my specific case?  What you guys need is a guide for several differnet budgets that says "This is what you need to buy(talking actual product pages to point to, not vague names of things like "grow lights"), this is how you set it up, and this is how you run it."

Actually the DPR in jail is the second one, the first one was the programmer who created the site and carried the title for a little while. The second took the name after the first one stepped down and just handled managing the site and learned the technical skills needed as time went on.
