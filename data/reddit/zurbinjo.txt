@_date: 2019-07-16 05:41:37
Thank you, this seems like a pretty good advice!
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:50:47
Oh, so interesting. Very high quality article. /s
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:25:59
I'm not afraid to use BTC, I am afraid to send my BTC via sites, that have no reputation at all. I can't find anything about piixpay.com for example. There is one review page with a score of 73% without any user reviews. You don't give a fuck about this? You've never been scammed?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:30:26
What about me? :/
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:54:03
What is LN? :/
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:48:13
Sorry, but my employer does not pay in BTC. This may work for super fancy avant-garde companies (in the USA), but definitely not in my case. And it won't happen any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:58:01


Friend of mine got in because of my advise to think about BTC. He got in on the high and now there is this dip (started ~12h after he bought). We will see how strong the hodlmight is with this padawan.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:52:00
I have to pay taxes, if I use BTC after they have trippled their worth. At least this would be the case, if I change back to fiat first. Not sure how it is supposed to work with using these services... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:31:00
Oh caseking would have been so great, but they don't have the switch. Still great to know that they accept BTC (at least I know where to buy VR gear, now).
Gonna check the other links for shops in Europe, thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:10:08
Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:59
How do you find bitcoins on hard drives? How were they stored? Is it like there is a folder that says "BTC" and in it is a .txt with all the information you need? (I know it is not like that, but I don't understand how to get BTC from a former HDD... haven't been involved back then)
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:23:44
I'd recommend Trezor. The support is great and it is very easy to use. I bought it as a total noob and had no problem to handle it, at all.
Actually I think there is no big difference to Ledger, but from my experience I only can recommend Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:05:28
Wow this is really cool! But I still don't dare to change my whole life to cryptos like you obviously already did. Guess this works better in Trumpland and with no trust issues... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:39
Ok, thank you for your help. I feel better now :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:08
You could still bet on that lambo.

Is Christmas on 10th of December in your country?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:04
This means I can pay anywhere I get an invoce with BTC? Those sites don't look so reliable. I am afraid of using them.. :'|
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:49:09
Won't the tx be cancelled if this takes too long or what happens with a too-low-tx?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:32:14
Thank you for that reply! It sums up a lot of things, I've read on a lot of different places and makes it very easy for me to understand.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:37:13
And what about taxes, if I use such a service? I guess I have to handle them by myself? You don't have to pay taxes on Coruscant, so you?

You are a BTC yoda, so no wonder. But us padawans can't handle it that easily :/
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:53:19
You are right. I will try this with a smaller amount and not directly with the switch (to me 350$ are a lot). Again, thank you for your wise words, master! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:49:50
I'm ok with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:09:49
Dammit, need to sell on next dip 
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:07:59
I hope you at least meant "bought".
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:15:27
fixed that for you: quoting someone while changing a "mistake" in the original post
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:14:45
Thanks for the tip and help, man! Happy cake day!
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:40:07
Stupid noob question, but how to pay with Lightning? Is there an app, that I connect with my adress or how does it work?
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:35:48
But some people answered my question very satisfactorily...?
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:58:40
I am very new to this and bought my first bitcoin (1!) this weekend. Since then, the price is dropping and I feel very bad.
Am I still ok? Please just say, everything is going to be allright ;)
**edit: Wow, thank you all for the nice comments! I didn't expect to be treated that kind in this sub. You really helped me and made me feel and understand this better. Thanks!**
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:52:09
This is really helpful, thank you! I feel like my decision to buy was ok!
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:30:26
Nah, my sleep is ok. I'm just a bit nervous, because it is my first time buying a lot of one 'item' (sorry, don't know the correct term - no native speaker).
If, in worst case, I lose all that money, I would be pissed, but I wouldn't be broke.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:21:32
I would be ready for that, because I know it is risky to invest in bitcoins. 
What would you do, if the price goes down that low? Wait? Buy more?
You said, within 2 years, the price was reduced 6 times. From which price to which? If I look at a 3 years chart, it seems like the price is going up 'constantly' except for a drop in June/July 2017.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:59:11
Great advice, thank you!
So as a holder, you don't buy on low prices? You just bought one time and wait for 'that one price' when you want to sell?
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:16:13
Ok, that's exactly what I hoped for. I mean, I followed the price (in Euro) going up from 2500€ to 3700€ and bought at ~3500€, now.
Actually I wasn't sure, when to buy, so I just did it, even if it seems like I've bought on some kind of 'spike', now. Still I believe, that the price will go beyond my investment.
Thanks for comforting me! 
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:03:41
Looks like we'll be fine. Price is rising again and we actually bought at the lowest in between the last days :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:40:12


Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:16:56
:D we will! ... I hope.
Will you buy more, when the price is lower? I mean, we already bought at a higher price, so why not? ;)
But it seems like the price doesn't drop any further... at least for the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:27:49
Thank you for your kind words! :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:27:04
Somehow you are right, but 1 bitcoin is still a lot of money (at least right now), that I am 'able' to lose (no kids yet ;) ), but of course don't want to lose.
Still I think, that I'm fine right now. You all soothed my nerves very well :)
@_date: 2018-10-02 07:47:28
Sure, its a trouser!
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:41:17
But all my spare fita money goes to BTC! :D
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:42:34
I use bitcoin.de and you can trade BCH there, too. The register-process may be a bit annoying, but I have a good feeling about that exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:53:56
But I can't buy food with BTC. Do I have to open a supermarket that accepts BTC, now?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:59:42
And he is clearly not your guy, bro!
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:15:35
Greedy. At least I am. So be fearful. Than I can be more greedy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:47:29


Well, somehow...? I mean, it won't happen, that I send them my money to buy the bitcoin-certificate and they don't give it to me. But this could happen with an unknown user on an exchange plattform, right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:15:29
EDEKA supports bitpay? I didn't know this. Great, thanks a lot!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:41:16
Thanks for this kind of an ELI5! :) I think I get it, now.
What I don't get is how the "last part" of this transactions work: If I buy something: There is always the last part, where a product has to be sent to an address. This address somehow HAS to be connected to my name, right? 
Same thing if I sell something: There is always that part, where my money goes onto paypal/bank/whatever-account which HAS to be connected to my name... or am I just totally naive? Probably I am.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:32:35
What is this? I've missed it :'(

c Programming language?
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:05:36
You are so right, thanks for the motivation! :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:03:38
Dammit... you are the final one to convince me. I'll just hodl the shit out of that fork!
Thanks for your post, it really helps with my decision making!
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:21:33
Yea right? Would this matter at all?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:44:33
Yeah I know that my question is somehow against "the ethics of BTC", but I want to understand the difference a "consumer" would have. If I don't use BTC for payment, but just for investing/hodling. Sure, I don't own a bitcoin, but I own a certificate correlating to a bitcoin. Price rises, price drops with the same factor. I buy from bank, I sell to bank. If I just have the pure value (relatively to my fiat) in mind, what is different?
Really, I mean no harm, I am just noobish as hell!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:07:43


This is an honest question, because I really don't understand it, yet: Aren't BTC used to buy illegal stuff on darknet (i. a.)? Or did I misread this? I mean, you can trace back any transaction, can't you? If not, wouldn't it mean, that BTC are anonymous?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:35:35
This sounds smart, but those people actually are not in my circle of friends or whatever kind of connections I have. 
At least I could convince one of my friends to join the BTC club. He loves it. :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:40:08
Yeah, why are LTC good complements to BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:31:43
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:42:05
Haha, interesting that you good the same "wishes" as me.
Which VR-system do you use? Do you follow BTC price with it? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:43:43


I've got the feeling that you can only live on BTC in certain countries. There is nothing you can do in Germany with BTC, except changing it back to fiat to buy stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:42:16
WTF? I missed that... maybe I should stop sleeping :/
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:01:17
My first buy-in finally doubled. This is so great :')
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:27:02
I see... but is this really so bad? I mean, you can't always wait until the prices stop increasind, can you? Maybe it is too late and you've MOed then :D
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:18:00
Good advice, I contacted the support of my exchange. Thanks for the hint!
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:12:39
WTF, I've seen the movie and the picture a zillion of times and never recognized this. I feel numb. And dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:19:15
Interesting idea. I thought about liquidating way less - especially since noone approved, that the prise will drop after fork :D - maybe around 15-30%.
I have to reconsider my strategy....
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:00


Probably because I am used to it.
Bitcoin may require no trust, but the users on exchange plattforms do, don't they? I mean, I could send them my money, but if they don't send me the BTC in exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:13:53
So (most) people expect, that the price will rise very quickly after the fork? I didn't know that. I just hopped in after the fork to BCH and BTC's price was a bit lower around that fork, wasn't it?
Thought it would be the same this time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:34:27
Ohh, I see! So this would be something like PayPal with BTC?
But this means, that sending BTC isn't "more secure" than sending fiat money?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:18:32


This is the thing that I am not able to imagine. If I want to get product/money there always has to be a point where the trace leads to me. But you don't have to explain me how this works. This discussion may have become a little bit too suspicious :D
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:55:14


Noob here, I don't understand this. To me this means exactly what people "fear": The more unconfirmed transactions the longer mining a block takes. Whatever this is supposed to mean, but it sounds bad in my ears. Seems like I am wrong, but I don't get it :/
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:36:26
Ok sure, with this point of view, it feels really bad :D
Guess it is all a matter of perspective...
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:28:48
Why 3 days?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:25:42
There is only an artist, that accepts BTC in my city.... at least :D
So I go to stores and convince them to accept?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:51:08
What are panic buys? When do you buy out of panic?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:14:12
Thanks for this explanation, really helps me!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:17:21
But why? It is the same as if you would have paid 10$ for that pizza instead of buying BTC for those 10$.
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:01:33
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:30:52
Do I need such a strategy or can I just buy on a monthly basis without plans on selling  (except when I have enough to buy estate)? 
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:35:48
Great, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:05:25
Thanks for your reply!
I believe in "the technology" although I have to admit, that I am not sure, which crypto will be the "final one". For now, I believe that BTC will at least be in the lead (besides mmaybe 1-2 other cryptos).
Nevertheless, I stopped believing/expecting/guessing how the price will change. I am not able to evaluate this. 
So maybe, after your words, we could sum my situation up: I believe in the technology, so I think the price will rise in the long term. Since I don't know how the price will change in short term, I could just keep investing on my regular basis. Correct?
One concern I have is, that the BTC price looks so freaking high. I can hardly imagine that it could go higher and higher. It just looks incredible that 1BTC should be equal to 9.000USD. Am I correct, that this is just a matter of units? Maybe it is not very senseful anymore to compare USD to 1BTC and comparing 1USD to 1/1000BTC (1mBTC?) would be more "useful"? I feel stupid asking this question... am I too stupid for BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:39:08
And how do you use it? On desktop or mobile? And how often do you check? Or you got an alarm or something?
I am jsut curious about how other people check for the prices. I mean, there can be high variations within minutes, can't there?
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:51:13
Thanks for your answer!
So I'd install Electrum and then I can "send" my bitcoins to Electrum? What happens, if I want to sell? Do I have to send from Electrum back t the marketplace or can I send directly to the buyer?
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:04:52
Maybe I should really spend my money on a hardware wallet. I dislike the idea of creating multiple paper wallets and keeping them all physically organized.
With a hardware wallet I can put all BTC on it and send whichever amount I want whenever I want, right?
edit: What happens if I loose my hardware wallet or if it gets broken? I mean, it is USB and sometimes those connectors stop working. Can I still recover anyting saved on it?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:19:23
You are so right. Now is probably the right time to buy. Always. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:08:11
I bought bitcoins on bitcoins.de, a German marketplace for BTC and BCH. It is possible to sell them there, too. My question is: Do I have to put my bitcoins to an extra wallet and if so, why? Just for the safety, that bitcoins.de could get hacked or why would I have to do this?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:31:59
So "to short" means "sell at the highs" and you don't do this? That would be the tactic I want to follow considering bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:51:11
You, I like you very much. Thanks for all the explanations you offer in this thread!
Another questions: Are mobile wallets for Android any good or should I switch to (at least) a desktop software wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:54:10
Hey there,
how do you guys track the Bitcoin prices? I mean, it would be nice, if you'd recognize a remarkable low/high to buy/sell as soon as possible.
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:13:10
Thanks for your detailed and kind reply! I feel a bit more comfortable in this - to me - unknown and difficult price situation. Really, this is very helpful to me!
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:51:13
Thanks for your answer!

@_date: 2017-09-28 12:44:23
Wow, this is a very helpful post, thanks a lot!
Why are hardware wallets easier to use, then software wallets?  I need to decide what to do and I'd actually prefer just to have software on my mobile phone or desktop pc. Mobile seems to be most comfortable way, although not the securest.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:26:53
Thanks for your reply!
I've read it on [this site]( that people may use a coin-mixer to prevent a replay-attack. coinmixer.se is recommended there. 
After reading your post, I am pretty sure, that I will refrain from trying this out, thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:02:01
I am very impoverished this month, because I always bought when I thought of a dip. No fluent money left :D
Thanks for your reply. This may be helpful. If I only buy at a dip and there is no dip, it would have been smarter to buy just on 1st of the month.
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:39:01
sometimes I see highs in charts that are only for a couple of minutes(/seconds?). For example:
Bitcoins.de tells me, that there was a value of 4.200€ (!)  around 11 AM CET. Sorry for the German/European values, I am unable to recalculate them right now.
What do those highs mean? Is it possible to sell in those minutes or is this just some kind of "mistake"?
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:14:15
Hehe ok, still thanks for your replys. It is nice to see how great this community is...  and  interesting how many different views and aspects there are.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:42:37
How would you contribute as a developer? 
So you'd say a mobile wallet is more secure than a desktop one? My mobile phone has touched the internet, too :D
Hardware wallets are sooo expensive and I am still only "trying this out". Is it possible (/smart) to buy a second-hand wallet? Which model would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:08:27
!RemindMe 960 days
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:07:33
Hm. Never thought of it this way. But I'd have to sell them first, so I don't have the money immediately, at least if you can't pay in bitcoins, which you can't in a lot of places right now. Right?
And you have to have a lot of trust that "this all works". Don't you have any worries? I mean, you obviously understand a lot more about bitcoins than I do (not only because of this post). I feel a bit strange about pumping money into bitcoins. I do it, because I want to try and get familiar with it, but I am still very unsure how this will work out.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:24:12
So I started with BTC in August 2017. Everything looked pretty awesome until the last couple of weeks happened. I didn't do anything about my portfolio (no buy/sell since almost a month) and wonder if I should react to that extremly changing prices somehow. Right now I am just waiting...
Should I just keep going with my "tactic" to buy on a regular basis, no matter what the current price is? Would it be smarter to wait a little bit longer and see what happens?
Is there even a correct answer to this question? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:58:44
Hm, interesting! Although I don't understand this :D
What would be the way to go:
1. buy BTC on an exchange website.
2. send from exchange to my bitcoin address
3. enjoy how my bitcoins rest in safety
4. use my private key to spend or sell my bitcoins, whenever I want
Is that correct? On the mentioned website ( they talk about "Spend your bitcoins by going to blockchain.info and sweep the full balance of your private key into your account at their website." I don't get this? Why do I need to do this? Or do I have to do this after step 2. from above?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:34:47
Yes, you are right. I meant, that I don't want to spent another dollar (in my case euro) this month (from my monthly salary) for bitcoins, because there is not much left. But this has always been so and would be the same without bitcoins. Good thing is, that WITH bitcoins, I didn't spent the money for stupid stuff, but bought BTC :)
But this has nothing to do with my whole "investments". There is more than bitcoins and there is quickly accessible, too. Although I have to admit, that I tend to shift a bigger and bigger part of my savings to bitcoins. It is so alluring! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:12:46
Thanks for your reply to my noobish question.
So what does this mean to me? If I get this stuff correctly there will be two forks: One is happening right now with BTG and the other one will happen in November with B2X. My BTC are administrated by me and my Trezor. What should I do? Send my BTC to an exchange to get BTG and B2X? Will I still get them, if I keep them on Trezor? And if I get them: I shouldn't trade with them as long as there is no replay protection implementet, should I?
So confusing...
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:29:15
You really buy dips or you just buy on a regular basis like "every 1st of the month" or whatever? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:56:17
Sorry, I am no native speaker and I don't understand what you mean by "I don't short". I hope it is not a joke and I am just dumb...
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:22:31
Thanks for your reply!
The more I read stuff like that, the more confident I get about it.
The thing is: In the frst place I came here to buy some bitcoins and sell them, as they have risen in value. I never thought about bitcoins being some kind of real investment. But everything looks so different now...
My Trezor is on the way, so I can finally securely hodl! :D
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:29:46
What about the fork in November? It is not sure whether it will happen or not, right?
If so, BTC price will go down and one will get the difference in the new currency, right again?
Sorry I need to ask this. I just got into business short after the first fork ;) 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:23:44
I don't feel confident enough to call it savings account (yet). Should I?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:09:04
I just joined a month or two ago at ~4000usd. Way too late...but still great! 
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:12:12
But maybe one should change his mind, if the profit is high enough?
I don't know... maybe this business is to tough for me :D
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:29:52
Wow, nice plans! So you're not afraid it is a bubble that may burst?
Are you buying on a regular base like every month for XXX$?
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:06:05
This sounds great! I will order the Trezor, I guess. Reading through some reviews made me feel like it is a bit mor comfortable then the Ledger Nano S.
What I still don't understand: 


How can I sign a transaction if the device with the "money" on it is not connected to the internet? Do I have to scan my monitor with it or something?
If I order the Trezor, will there be a manual? :D Seems like I'd really need it!

I don't really understand those forks, yet. I joined the BTC community with the last fork and BCH doesn't seem to matter very much.

So you mean, the situation is always the same, no matter how high it is in absolute value?

This sounds smart. Do you have any experience, if there is "a time" when dips are most likely? I mean, for example, it is the end of the month right now and there is some kind of dipping (after a great raise in value all over this month). So can one say, that in the end of the month, dips are likely, because people don't have much money left or something like that?
Or do you just always follow the price and have your XY$ to buy when the dip (what you think is a dip) is right there?

Great, I just ordered the Trezor. Thank you for the consulting :)

Oh really? I thought you recommended to use a linux distribution to configure even a hardware wallet, but maybe I misunderstood! Thanks for soothing me :)

But how long? You can't hold forever and there must be some point where you decide to sell. When/why is that?

So I got my BTC on a Trezor. This is my first fork, what will happen?
Will I see B2X on my Trezor after the fork? Then I send it to an exchange and sell it there?

This sounds really great... I mean like.. really! It makes sense and I would really like to support this. But: I (personally) can only trust you and believe in this. To me there is no proof, evidence or whatever may be the fitting English term for this. And neither there is to you, is there?
I am no economist who can evaluate whether this system will work or not. Are you? How can you make this statement you just make and are sure about it?
This is no offense, I honestly want to know.

Each week? How much? I mean, I can't spend 50 dollars each week just for bitcoins. And buying less feels not enough... Is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:18:50
This helps me a lot, thanks for taking the time to answer my questions!

It is automatically PIN protected, isn't it? I always have to enter PIN if I want to do transactions.
Furthermore, I could set a passphrase, but I am not sure, how this is exactly working and if there is need for it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:37:50
Why are you so sure about it? Have you read so much convincing things or is it mor elike you "believe"?
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:24:23
So you never sell? Up to what point?
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:51:29
Ok, I got it. And I finally put my first BTC on my Trezor. It feels so good and I love the handling of the Trezor. But there is one thing, that I feel like it may be a bit annoying:
If I want to sell BTC on "my" exchange, I need to transfer from Trezor to the exchange first. I don't have my Trezor with me all the time, so if I want to sell spontaneous, I can't!
Is there some kind fo workaround to this? Always keep BTC on the exchange account? Hm....

I've just read about the next fork in November. Does this mean, if I own bitcoins, I will get some value in another currency and the bitcoins themselves will be of less values?
If so, what is a smart thing to do: Sell (at least a bit) right before the fork, because the rate is at some kind of a high point or should I hold, because I would get most of that second currency then?
Sorry, I am really new to this...

Is it save enough to use a Windows 10 desktop pc and virtualize Ubuntu to configure my Trezor hardware wallet via that Ubuntu?
I do not own another device to configure my Trezor with :/

Honest question: Did you choose 19.800 to sell right before 20.000 or did you just post without any further meaning?
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:23:00
Did it happen to you? Which bank?
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:32:03
So there are people taking this seriously? That's bad.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:33:28
What was different, could you explain?

I'm not from America. Is the NYPost a "newspaper" that is read by anyone? The website looks like a school project. Elementary school.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:26:23
I see. You are right: Feels pretty much like now :)
