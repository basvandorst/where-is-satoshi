Or you know, you could research it before you invest. If you are going to treat it like an investment to make money(which I assume you are) then wouldn't you treat it like any other investment opportunity? You know, like when you go and look at a house to buy. You get it inspected, check the taxes, do a walk through to make sure it suits your needs and compare prices of similar property to form your offer for the realtor. Or like when you buy a car and take it for a test drive and maybe get a pre-inspection by your favorite mechanic. I mean shit. People act like crypto is some secret mystical art that is so illusive to the average person. When in reality information on crypto can be easily found by one fucking google search.   Newbies who won't even research before investing in it are the perfect example of "dumb money". I shouldn't have to "dumb it down" when there are a myriad of ways for the average person to not only learn about various crypto, but also purchase said crypto. Furthermore, the portion of the population who would be willing to put money in crypto most likely have access to a phone and the internet so there is no excuse for the laziness on display. 
EDIT: Sorry misread and thought you were buying to invest. But my comments still apply to your prior comment anyway. Also idk why you would be worried about other crypto if you are purchasing btc to just send to someone for goods/services. You can find all the information you need with a google search and access most services using a smart-phone

Ok well when you buy meat at the store do you buy the prime steak cuts when they are on sale or when there is a meat shortage? Good for you getting into BTC. That's cool really, I'm all for that.

I feel your pain. I had over 100 at one point in time

Too bad i'm super broke now(like sub $1k in accts). My life has been a tumultuous trainwreck for like 3 years now. Trying to re-evaluate everything and start fresh. Just hard knowing what I know now. That is the point I am making. But thank you for the kind words.

Really? I must be one of the lucky coinbase users. I just had to perform the required banking links and now I can buy up to $1000 instantly.

I'll be the one guy here to say yes. I got into Bitcoin gambling in the midst of a personal gambling problem. The ease with which I could play poker or live dealer blackjack made this easy. At first it was small but soon I'd spent around 5k on btc gambling. I of course indulged my habit and ended having a huge 9 hr run on bitcoinvideocasino(up $30k in btc;roughly 76 btc at the time). I'm only 24 and had 9k in debt prior to my gambling activities; so this win was huge. Paid off all my bills then proceeded to lose 18k in 2 days. &lt;- I know stupid. After that loss, I was in a very dark place and I sought out help from my parents(mom is a licensed nurse so I easily found a therapist through her). Since then I've relapsed twice and dropped another $1200. Yes I know I have gambling issues, but I'm trying my best to quit. Anyway there is my story, hope others can read this and understand how bad gambling of any kind can get. I'm just happy I can accept the reality of the situation and the fact that I'm comfortable enough with everything now to share this with you all.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:52:53
Ps: I urge anyone who even thinks they might have a gambling problem to seek out help asap. I spent the last 7 months of my life in a gambling haze so trust me when I say life us better when you don't have to constantly worry about your gambling expenditures. Sorry for rambling and the walls of txt, but I just hope someone who is contemplating gambling or who has issues, sees this and takes advice from someone who has experienced both ends of the gambling spectrum

This is a variable that changes every hand. At some point the odds will be against you. That doesn't mean you won't win that hand, whether it be because you are a better player or because you hit your quads on the river.

Should edit that to say : mass adoption doesn't equate to equal or proportional holdings between the rich and poor. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:12:14
Further, as a previous redditor stated at one point in time all paper money was back by gold and other valuable metals.  So yea.... Idk what more you need to understand that gold has been mass adopted already.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:37:50
Gold was mass adopted decades ago but ok.  Fuck,  the ignorance on display is staggering.  Have you not heard of the gold standard?  Why would banks stockpile gold?  Oh wait...  Because gold has been a mass adopted, traded and used product since the fucking mid 1800s(and honestly even earlier).  You think the Spaniards who conquered the Aztecs stole their precious gold artifacts because gold might be valuable/adopted later?  My guess is they did so because gold was already recognized, used and backed on a global level. Fuck go study history and econ 101 before you spew dumb shit on reddit 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:57:22
If you never use it and only hold it for possible large roi,  then you are not acting as a bank since you are not transacting anything.  
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:54:39
If no one is trading or moving funds ever then there is no mining actually happening.  It would just stagnate until it hits obscurity then crash due to no one wanting it since no one is using it. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:05:54
Without a proper use case and regular use adoption won't increase unless a huge bull run is happening and speculators jump in to make quick profit(think late 2017). My interpretation of the white paper is that btc was created as a superior method (in comparison to fiat) of transacting value/assets from one user to another. Yes you can hold,  but if no solid use case ever develops and transactions are rare then why would an average person buy crypto or develop an economy around it.  There is a reason TPS is so important. Just my 2cents.  I'm not saying you have to use your btc in a certain way,  I'm saying it has always been a superior way of transferring assets and up until 2016-2017 it wasn't seen/hyped up as a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:02:32
Really you do?  Cause the point of bitcoin is to perform transactions on a non fiat tied network.  So yea....  You should be actively using btc not just hoarding it.

Pepperidge farm remembers. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:33:01
I totally understand that.  Ive been using and holding bitcoin since 2015. Mind you, I'm not holding an obscene amount nor am I a crypto millionaire.  I have always put a couple in cold storage and when I buy more I transfer over around 60% into cold storage,  but then I use the rest to buy things.  I know everyone is different,  but I believe in order for a product(in this case asset)  to grow it has to have a sustainable user base that actively uses the asset/product(in this case btc).
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:52:00
There are quite a few merchants that accept crypto.  Found this list via quick Google search,  but there def are more than just this list.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:51:46
I never said it was distributed evenly,  but OK.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:44:03
Ive never had reddit gold before!

You could just have a line item that would contain those funds.  It could just be listed as a misc line item or you could merge those expenses into the military budget.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:58:06
I agree,  the onboarding process for crypto is atrocious atm. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:16:09
Exactly.  Hoarding btc will not create value anyway.  It needs to have an active and thriving use case in order to hit ath levels.  Right now it's a speculative investment with very good potential.  I own btc, eth and a couple other crypto,  but I'm not expecting any ath returns or bull runs until btc resolves scalability issues and has active and thriving use cases. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:35:16
If you are holding long term you are really using bitcoin as a speculative investment and not as a medium of transaction. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:05:31
Mass adoption doesn't equal equal distribution.

@_date: 2018-11-28 18:30:30
Well, I mean gold has been mass adopted but in happened years and years ago.  Why do you think governments around the world stockpile gold.  Hint: it's not because it's shiny.  
Fuck haven't you heard of the gold standard.  The argument that gold was never mass adopted is absolute trash,  because it has been adopted by the masses. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:00:27
Yes I realize,  but at the time it was a little over 30k.  I was upset with myself for a bit,  but then realized there is no point in crying about something I can't change/take back.  The best course of action imo was to learn from the experience and move on. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:53:25
It would be less obstruction than just not listing anything.  At least I'll know this excess went into the military and didn't just dissapear into someones pocket.  We all get that we can't see every line item that the money would go to. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:29:59
Do you own a modern day graphics card,  phone or electronic device?  Then by your logic every valuable metal in the chip boards has been mass adopted.  You don't know what you are talking about,  so I'm done making contributions in this conversation.  You obviously don't want to see things as they are and instead insist on arguing a fucking moot point.  Sry bro,  gold has been adopted by the masses.  Anyone can easily obtain gold right this very second and easily sell it to fiat with proper regulations in place to protect both parties in the transaction. I encourage you to go study economics and gold.  Have a good day and I wish you the best. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:09:39
Well seeing as the gold trade has been around for 100s of years,  I'd say you are wrong.  It's hard to explain mass adoption to someone who doesn't understand the basic concepts or history of valuable assets.  
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:30:20
Just depends on what I need honestly.  I used to buy a lot of pc parts with btc(newegg, amazon). Sometimes I buy gift cards throught gyfter and I bought some furniture through overstock in the past as well.  Now I use it for most items where bitpay is an option. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:30:18
Does it really?  Let's say everyone is hoarding(not selling)  and No use case comes to fruition so new crypto users/buyers begin to dwindle in size due to lack of real world use.  Transactions begin declining due to no trades or buying actions happening.  So miners, no longer having an active role due to lack of transactions, decide to abandon their mining activities because they no longer have incentive to mine.  Now the network itself is lacking a key component(miners). So now there are no buyers,  no sellers and no transactions happening which would render btc useless.  I would assume in this scenario, btc itself would begin decreasing in value due to all these aspects.  The only people who see value at this point are those who have hoarded it up to the present and thus they are stuck in the cold with an asset no one sees as valuable(except those who are holding it) and no one is willing to buy their bags, since there is no way to actually spend/utilize the btc. 
Edit: I'm not saying this is happening,  just theorizing a scenario in which everyone in the market refused to sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:19:20
I feel like it's a deadcat bounce before another drop.  Still bought a little more
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:58:18
I understand what you are saying tho.  I also despise large institutional banks and their practices so I'm all for anyone buying crypto.  I just think it should be used as a transactional medium. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:35:26
them be fightin' words round here boy 
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:00:09
For real.  Oh no someone lost $300 in value by selling to fiat yesterday. Big fucking whoop.  This is the problem with the crypto community as a whole. We are so worried about short term gains/loses and "mooning", that we turn into shitheads.  For crypto to succeed in the long run it needs mass adoption and use.  If I get mocked for selling my btc,  then I'm less likely to buy back in and support crypto in the future.  So shout out to you OP for being a bag of dicks.  You should be encouraging ppl to actively trade crypto on a regular basis,  not hoard it. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:38:08
Also buying things with btc,  increases the use case and if everyone began using btc or petitioning for btc acceptance as a payment method the amount of people willing to adopt btc would grow too. On top of that,  by using btc to purchase something you are supporting everyone involved including the miners. Finally if more people began using btc freely it would gain more exposure and the public at large wouldn't just see it as a risky investment they sometimes see someone talking about on TV.  My dad is a prime example.  He saw me buying a pc part with btc and how I received a discount.  He then asked about btc and I spent a couple days talking to him about it and answering his questions.  He then read the white paper and bought some btc after seeing me actually use btc as a method of payment(me as a first-hand proof of concept basically). He actually pays one of his workers partially in btc and uses it to make purchases as well. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:24:28
Also,  I make it a point to buy at least 1 item a month with crypto,  because that's the whole fucking point of cryptocurrencies anyway.  You know,  to be used as a payment medium
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:03:02
It wasn't courage. I agree.  But in order to win big you must bet big in the game of blackjack and I didn't mind betting $500-1k/hand during this phase of my life. Scared money doesn't make money.  Not saying you should expect to win a game in which the odds are not in your favor either.

And you missed the whole point again.  I have btc too,  and I also buy things with crypto on the regular.  But you're right I'm a shit head for pointing out that gold has been used world-wide as a payment method for 100s of years and thus can be considered mass adopted.  One day you might be able to pull your head out of your own ass long enough to give valuable insight-- unfortunately that is not the case today.

Hi Mark, Can you please provide the Private Keys for the account where you stored all your extra btc. Figured I'd ask since you know, you giving away btc and all. JK JK
All jokes aside, sorry that happened to you man and I wish you all the best.
Also: Is there any way for me to get the .35btc back that I had on your exchange when you filed for bankruptcy. You can keep the BCH, but hoping to get some compensation at some point. If anyone has any idea about recouping of funds then please let me know. Thanks.

Shouldn't matter anyway. A good lawyer should still be able to be effective even if the funds were part of a fraudulent scheme.  Obviously op doesn't care enough or is naive enough to not get a lawyer.  I'm pretty sure many a lawyer would take the case for a percentage share of btc recovered in/if there is a judgment
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:11:12
AND just now, everything returned to normal. The transactions are still missing but I am now positive .5BTC in my acct. IM NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING
@_date: 2013-12-14 07:08:59
This just happened to me too. I received .5 BTC on coinbase like 30 minutes ago. Sent the funds to three separate addresses. Refreshed the page to see that I was -.5 BTC. I refreshed it and two of the transactions have disappeared from my account page and I now am at -.35 BTC. None of the sent transactions have hit my other accounts either.
