What is this supposed to mean? Do you somehow not see the chart? 
I'm not claiming this to be anything other than what that chart shows. During this specific event, BTC price followed that of the global markets.
Or are you somehow implying Bitcoin is the only asset around absolutely disconnected from everything?

The main issue is that if exporting becomes so profitable for producers, there is no reason whatsoever to sell their produce locally. You can imagine where this leads... local scarcity, price increases, inflation, devaluation, more exporting, local scarcity, price increases, yada yada yada...
So yeah.. it's a pretty fucked up situation. These are the hidden cracks in the global economy, getting bigger every day..

@_date: 2014-01-22 23:10:02
Read my post above to understand why.
Tl;dr is we have no way of acquiring BTC at competitive market prices.
What's needed here in Argentina is a big BTC whale willing to come in and setup a very risky and altruistic operation to allow Argentine's to acquire BTC at sensible costs, in the hopes that being an early mover will yield for him in the future. Not an easy or particularly appealing opportunity with so many other countries in the world presenting much better growth opportunities.

You use the USD directly. Everyone ~~accepts~~ wants USD here of course.
These are not just "street currency exchangers". There is no amount of money you cannot move in the black market here (unless we're talking about billions USD). 
Possible saving spending:
+ Real estate: is quoted and sold in USD here.
+ Travel: Need USD obviously.
+ Hereditary: better let sit as USD.
+ Day to day: no problem, sell at black market. 
The only common case for wanting to trade your USD back to Pesos 
is because you are in a position to make an arbitraging move (sell USD to black market 1:12, rebuy USD through some Offcial channel (1:8) or some at discount rate you might somehow get).

They do no want to bring the dollars back to the country ! 
Why would you?
Only what you need to cover operational costs (which should be covered by the legal front side of the business). The rest remains outside of our economy. That's the whole point.  
Why would they want to bring the BTC here and then send the USD to offshore accs?? That's a big no no here and would incur in huge taxation losses if they ever manage to do it (sending money is no go).
If the business is fully illegal and you absolutely need to get the money back into our country, then yes, BTC will of course be a lot more helpful.

@_date: 2014-01-22 22:49:41
Argentine here.
You guys are mixing up two related but separate things here.
This last horrible measure is the complement of previous measures already at play here that desperately aim to stop capital flight. It is also in direct response to what has been happening during the last 6 months: ordering stuff from China through mail has absolutely overwhelmed and crippled the already weak and old argentine mail system. This issue is in turn the response from people arbitraging the different USD rates we've got here.
It goes something like this:
1. Official USD/Peso rate: 1 USD : 7 Pesos
2. Credit Card USD/Peso: 1 USD : 7 Pesos + 30%
3. Black market USD/Peso (dollar blue we call it): 1 USD : 12 Pesos (THIS is the real rate used for all commerce and transactions not involving banks)
Previous measures and situation:
+ Rampant corruption on every level of the Gov and public services.
+ People cannot buy USD at Official rate unless they go through nasty processes with the AFIP (Arg's IRS), where they have to somehow justify the buy and wait approval. It never goes through.
+ People can not import goods unless they are exporting a bigger amount, and even if their quota is good most people/business still are not granted permission, or even worst: they get permission for the importing but they don't get permission to buy the USD needed to buy the goods. It's a corrupt quota system and it also has sprung a quota black market.  
+ Up until a few months, people were still able to buy overseas stuff with their CCs, and VISA and MC were forced by the Gov here to accept monthly payments in Pesos and exchange that through Official rate. Also if you had USD in your account and go to the ATM it would spit out Pesos at official rate. This situation got rapidly arbitraged and exploited (as it should): Clear out a CC, travel to neighbor country Uruguay and get cash advance of full CC limit in USD out through the ATM, come back to Argentina with USD in your pocket and sell USD to black market, pay to Visa your advance in pesos at Official rate. Rinse and repeat. People were doing this 10 cards at a time.
This situation got SO BAD SO QUICKLY the Gov had to create an intermediate dollar rate by forcing the CCs to charge a 20% tax on CC USD. This merely curbed the travelling thing ( by reducing arb profits). It was not enough, people were still doing this other scheme: I buy a 100 USD product on Amazon, pay 700 Pesos (100 x 7, Official rate) to Visa, sell my product in the market at Black rate conversion: 1200 Pesos. Rinse and repeat. 
So a couple months back they've raised that phantom tax even further to 25% (amounts to 30 after VISA and MC's own "exchange fees")).
It is still not enough, so now they've gone ahead and added the new choke point in the postal service (in truth, this specific two items per year was already there, and you had to pay 50% on all following items, but it wasn't being enforced due to the postal system being completely over saturated and out of control). 
Soooo, this new measure is not aimed at or doesn't particularly affect BTC itself. Yet, the truth is all the measures preventing BTC adoption are ALREADY in place: 
+ Our banks are disconnected from the world (either literally or through exorbitant fees). We cannot link them to any exchange out there, nor can we do (sensible) wire transfers because of prohibiting costs and corrupt taxes. So NO buying from Exchanges.
+ Even if you have a friendly private foreign seller, we cannot legally acquire the USD to buy BTC.
+ For a few months there was a good arbitraging opportunity if you had sellers willing to sell you through CC (you'd pay almost official rate) and you could get BTC buyers who'd pay at black market rate. Spreads have closed too much since (things are now even worst and escaping Gov's control so the spread seems to be loosening again and some opportunities might arise again).
The Gov does not want to officially devaluate, but they simply cannot control capital flight. They have been slowly and silently devaluating a few cents per day (Official USD was 5,5 just two months ago, now sits at 7).
All the while, it is widely known that some heavy duty Gov official have been visiting the illegal black market "coves" (as we call them here) at GUNPOINT (yes, this shit is for real) forcing them to curb their business in an effort to close the official/blue spread to stop arbitraging.
For months there have been rumors that soon we will get the next logical step from the Gov: all CCs will be prohibited from buying foreign stuff and/or use other currencies. I honestly thought it wouldn't come so far, but this tightening of the postage sure points to that if things keep escalating.
  
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:34:52
Most of Argentina's exporters (the ones not big enough to be closely scrutinized by Gov) do a fair chunk of their operations on the low using foreign bank accounts (typically Uruguay for SouthAmerica, Miami for US and Spain for EU) and are already getting paid in USD, arbitraging and making the most out of the situation.
For them, BTC would reduce the banking and remittance fees as usual but it would incur the extra hassle of having to sell the BTC here at blue-rate (1:12) which is not as easy as it sounds, and even harder for large amounts of capital. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:18:18
Hey, it's actually not that complicated. I'll try to give you an ELI5 answer:
When you store your funds on GreenAdress.it they are stored using multisig 2-of-2 transaction. That means those funds cannot be moved again unless both your key and GA's key are used.
That's great because it means GA has no way to move (or steal) your coins without you confirming the transaction with your own key; but it also means you would not be able to move them without GA providing their key (ie: if they disappeared). 
To solve that, GA implemented nLockTime transactions, which allows you to set an expiry date on your transactions. So now, if GA happens to disappear you simply need to wait for the set expiry date and once it's due you are again in control of your funds and free to redeem them (without needing GA's intervention).
Simply put, they have no way of stealing your coins, and even in the case of disappearance you're still assured to get them back.

Both are corrupt as fuck (partners in many businesses and sharing some models).  
But resource wise, Venezuela has oil and gas. Lots and lots and lots of it. In that regard, it has a lot more than Argentina to survive.
Of course, all money from natural resources (and also any industry doing good)  is being stolen and lost to corruption in both countries, so in the end it doesn't really make any difference.

@_date: 2014-02-03 06:56:39
I guess you really need to be here to understand how messed up things are.
Up until recently people could price most things freely in USD. Then of course capital control laws became more pervasive across all industries. 
But the truth is... It doesn't matter one bit if the Gov disallows pricing in USD. What happens of course, is you see a price increase in Pesos adjusted to black market rates (the underlying value in USD of the asset/product is the same), which then leads to bizarre stuff like price freezing "agreements", where the Gov. tried to somehow ban price increases to stop inflation..
Bottom line is of course, there is no trust in the Gov, the banks or the Peso itself. No incentive at all to repatriate foreign capital.

I was not talking about Wine specifically there. We're seeing rabid hyperinflation across all industries right now (20% inflation last week alone !).
But yeah you're right: like I said in OP, if the wines are high end enough, the costs may be justified. 
Just to give you an idea though, the last quote I got from DHL a couple months ago for shipping a 6 bottle box was 249 USD.

Hi there,
Argentine here.
I've tried this idea in the past, but it is still a no-go.
Problem, as commented above, is how nightmarish it is to export from here. 
There are hassles from a legal standpoint and also absurd shipping costs (if you wanted to sell single bottles, the shipping will always cost more than the bottle unless you're talking about very high end wines). 
My conclusion thus far is that it could potentially be profitable  but it would require a fair bit of initial capital to do so in a legal fashion, and further more it would be absolutely dependent on the demand for the very HIGH end wines.
That said, I'm always open to experiments, so if you absolutely must try one of our wines, let me know; I could re-assess the current postage situation (there were some recent changes).

That's awful. I'm verry sorry for you and for us all.
I live in Argentina and Paypal or CC is the only for me to acquire BTC. Our banking system is in default and I cannot legally buy USD here. Visa &amp; and the other CCs are forced to do the exchange for us at fixed (gov') rate, but I cannot do any of the bank stuff.
My few BTC were acquired through CC-&gt;Paypal-&gt;VirWox(USD)-&gt;VirWox(Linden)-&gt;VirWox(BTC)-&gt;wallet..
..with a FEE in every step of the way. Nasty.
People like me are being left out of a supposedly all-inclusive system because of these sad scammers and Paypal &amp; CC's inability to correctly review these cases.
This problem troubles me. 
Aren't there any easy usable escrow systems out there that could bridge this gap?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:24:14

I think a permanent loss of data due to some error, problem, incident is highly unlikely.
A much more likely scenario would be that of government seizure or something of the kind.
There was also a case lately (I can't remember which site it was) where one of the users found a vulnerability in the code by which he could gain access to any of the wallets in the site. He submitted the problem to the site and they went offline (presumably till fixed...  or forever?).

You just dug your own grave.
I'm from Argentina. A country:
+ in technical default
+ going through hyperinflation
+ where we can not legally buy dollars (or any other currency)
+ whose banking system is closed to the world (via exuberant fees)
Let me save you the trouble and give you the answer as well. The following is the most efficient way to acquire BTC here (I'll let you be the judge of whether it's "easy" as claimed):
1. Acquire USD through black market (at higher rate) (FEE loss 
2. Deposit USD to VirWox through CC or Paypal (FEE loss 
3. In VirWox: USD &gt; Linden dollars (FEE loss 
4. In VirWox: Linden dollars &gt; BTC (FEE loss 
5. Withdraw BTC from VirWox (FEE loss 
Of course, pray you have an old VirWox account.. if not, you are capped at 20-50 usd a day, making it so that to be able to buy a SINGLE (1) BTC you need to make 2 or 3 deposits, doubling or tripling the 5 fees above). Also, as a new VirWox user, you'll be happy to find out that BTC withdrawal is a 72hs process with a "manual step" on their side. 
Would you want me to buy some BTC for you at these rates?
EDIT: our situation is akin to the more known Ciprus case. Our countries are the ones who would benefit most from BTC, but unfortunately at the same time, they are the countries with the most difficulties acquiring them.

That's just because you may be one of the unexperienced traders he refers to.
Technical weakness is a trading term, regarding a stock or asset behaviour. It comes, obviously, from the trading world and it's got absolutely nothing to do with BTC itself.
The fact most of the people in this thread don't understand this is a clear indicator that there is valid point to what the OP is actually saying.

No. It's not that's tailored, it's bitcoin itself. Think wider. If you know what bitcoin is, you probably come from 
a) software dev world or 
b) financial world or 
c) freeworld/anti-system/anarchism world
So now let's talk about context and how you infer it, because you are now basing your argument on it.
So take a moment and re-read OP's post and the context cues you can infer from it: 
TITLE CUE: A warning [...] **from an experienced Trader**
Ok, I'd say that's a pretty effective way to clearly define a context: (paraphrasing) "hey i'm an **experienced trader** giving you this advice...". I'd say most people can succesfully infer context from that, unless you somehow think he is giving advice from the realm of dating or cooking or w/e.
FIRST LINE: Humans often do mistakes in **financial markets**.
This is pretty clear again huh?
Just to make this faster, I'll throw in now all the following keywords from the financial world I see after that:
**traders and investors**
**position** as in owning a stock
**asset you hold**
**hold bitcoin**
**hold real money in bitcoin**
These are all setting the CORRECT CONTEXT. He did not even make a single mention to the btc protocol itself, nor did he mention developers, bugs or any other keyword which might point you in the wrong direction.
Furthermore, look at the sentence with the issue itself.


Even if I were to remove everything else from the post, title included; there are only 2 keywords upon which to infer context in this sentence **technical weakness** and **HOLD**. Both again, from the financial word.
I think you either have really bad reading comprehension skills or you are drawing context from your imagination. There's no need to drag this discussion. Sometimes we are just uninformed and make mistakes, there's no shame in admitting it. We were all there at some point.

I'm not even talking about large quantities... Nevertheless, your argument is rock solid even when you are not taking into account a HUGE FACTOR we have here. Brace yourself:

2. We cannot acquire USD through banks.  
3. We CAN buy stuff in dollars with CC's. They are forced by our gov' to exchange at Official rate + 20% (1 USD = 6.4-5 AR Pesos)
4. Black dollar market rate: 1 USD = 8.8~ AR Pesos
You figure out the rest..... Fees everywhere do eat most of the arbitrage though.

This is true, but remember that right now, with the current block size; the whole bitcoin economy is capped at 6 tps.

Same boat here !
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:36:40
Yes, that's what I meant.
Take the trust system from Ripple. Decentralize it and build on top of btc like Zerocoin.
My issue with this (and most if not all alt-coins) is adding yet another coin/currency type. 
The way I see it (my rather pessimistic view), there are only two outcomes for the current scenarios: 
a) all alt-coins end up being worth nothing and all cryptocurrencies unite behind one or two main coins (btc &amp; ltc?)
b) alt-coins flood everything and fragmentation ends up killing all cryptocurrencies, btc included, due to lack of trust from the general (non-informed) public.
I definitely do not see 15-20 alt-coins (that's just this last year, multiply that exponentially for coming years..) succeeding. 
Is the addition of the coin an absolute must for your project??
Couldn't you just build a trust/escrow system or protocol on top btc, forsaking the creation of yet another coin ??
(Disclaimer: Maybe my question is dumb. I have not fully read your paper, only skimmed through it here at the office)

@_date: 2013-06-17 15:28:37
Yes, 2120 is probably not correct, given we're discovering coins at a faster rate than originally intended; but what you say is correct.
As we approach the last coins, the reward will tend to 0, and this creates a problem we are only starting to discuss now. It was one of the topics addressed by Gavin in Bitcoin 2013. If mining rewards tend to 0 as we approach the last coins, then there is no incentive for miners, and those last coins will never get mined. There is a proposed solution of fixing (as in fix rate, not repair) the amount of coin reward during the later years.
And yes, if there is no incentive for big money miners, they will drop out and diff should go down enabling mining for mere mortals (not asic) again. But that process will be slow and harsh for btc itself, implying an intrinsic design flaw. There could also be other competing paid uses for CPU/GPU/ASIC power, rendering mining those last few coins a very impractical and NOT cost-efficient.
We just have to wait and see what the real impact of ASICs is, and how much/fast can ASICs keep improving. How long can they deliver 2x mining every couple of months? What's that technology's roof or upper limit?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:26:59
I've been to that site, but local sellers are doing quite a big markup.
The real issue here in Arg is we've got an official dolar conversion rate and a black market rate ( and lots of inbetween.. ).
I need to buy them from outside, and staying outside of our banking system.
@_date: 2013-06-04 01:01:24
I know. I've studied the numbers. Sadly, shipping to Argentina is a big NO NO. Imports are closed. 
One of the odd outcomes of our current hyperinflation is that there are certain time windows where some products become cheaper than in the US. Such is the case of used ATI cards. Again, I've run the numbers and I could have started a potentially very interesting mining operation. BUT of course, this is not realistic because a) i cannot find enough used cards. and most importantly b) ASICs are here to stay; and again I'm left out.
ASIC are imho a very bad thing for BTC in general. They transfer power from the baseline to the already wealthy.

What? You got it all wrong/backwards..


What exactly are you trying to say here? He used the proper jargon, and hence he did not need to clarify. Using the proper jargon, one term has one agreed upon meaning. I don't have to tell you a tree is green, and then tell you what green is supposed to be. It is a convention, as are all different jargon types. 


This is exactly the opposite of what happened. Reddit is NOT a technical forum. Quite the contrary, it is the most layman forum, and that's why he's giving the advice he gives here. Bitcointalk dev subforum would be a technical forum, and the people in there will surely have invested their time learning all of this stuff, so they will not confuse two things which cannot be confused.
Again, the only reason why so many people got confused is because they are new/alien to economics/financials/stock markets; they have never heard the term "technical weakness" before. This is not a crime, and we've all been there. BUT if you are new, you should do a lot more research before questioning things you don't even fully understand.
Bottom line: if before answering here, confused redditors would've done the simplest of all things: google -&gt; trading technical weakness ; there would be no confusion.
This is not miscommunication on the OP side. This is misinterpretation due to lack of knowledge. Again, not a crime, but beware of it.

That's the most stupid logical reasoning ever.
Are you implying he SHOULD have warned you that BTC price was going to drop? WTF?? Why would he do that? 
He is just giving analysis backed advice now, which you may or may not take (I don't but I see his logic).
You on the other hand, have shown ZERO analysis ( which you are accusing people of ) and furthermore, with every post I read from you I come closer to the conclusion that you really don't know what you're talking about.
You are either a) retarded or b) just very new to economics and financial markets? or c) too young/lazy to sit down, research and learn some economics.

Patience friend, we are only just starting. 
Also consider the fact that the same things you fear from BTC Security, already happen today with fiat money. Security nowadays is at its worst point ever. Passwords are obsolete and with the advent of the massive smart phone penetration everything got exponentially less secure.
Lose a wallet, lose your money/btc.
Get pc/email hacked, lose your money/btc.
Bank/exchange run, lose your money/btc.
Get scammed in person, lose your money/btc.
Get scammed online, lose your money/btc.
Also think about this for a second: every single time you've used your credit card at a restaurant, the waiter took it with him and had complete access to every single number he needed to use that card. Where is the security in that??
Truth is, 99% of the times we use the word security, we're really talking about the FEELING of security. There is no security in the current way things work (not even in banking websites, talk to any NetSec specialist and he will quickly confirm that).
Bitcoin is just as secure as it was on day One. On the other hand, the feeling of security has grown exponentially in every front:
+ Mining: we are less prone to 51% attacks.
+ Exchanges: we used to rely on just one bad exchange, now we have +5.
+ Wallets: we now have wallets for every color and taste; online, offline, deterministic, etc..
+ Commercial trades: people are actually selling lots of stuff using BTC, by themselves or with stuff like Bitpay.
So... yeah... PATIENCE. We're getting there, and sooner than you might think.
@_date: 2013-06-08 22:48:22
While all of this is true, this is not the real answer. 
The truth is, BTC has come to a point where every gov' or institution out there cannot simply deny its big and growing market cap. But of course, everything is unregulated. 
These big players do not like it, but they know for sure money is flowing and moving in the btc economy.
So, to buy some time (until a decision is made whether to regulate/ban btc) they are increasingly homing in on every single service out there that aims bring that barrier down.
Of course, if you want more people to use BTC, the first and most effective measure would be to secure the USD/BTC / BTC/USD exchange, making it super easy for everyone including your grandma.
The big Fiat players are on exactly the opposite agenda. They want you to think this is so hard, shadowy and (maybe even criminal?) that you won't invest your time in it (let alone dollars...).

AFAIK forking the chain is pretty much a total mess.
Everything; minings and all transactions are reversed.
Every system out there using the old chain needs to hop on the fork asap or risk losing everything.

AFAIK the idea of moneygram is to buy it at stores (but I'm not american so don't take my word for it).
If you want, instanst, there are other ways, but none is easy with the CC alone. If you're in the US, you're better off through bank transfers, as stated above.
You could do the whole VirWox affaire... but it's only instant after a couple transactions.
Problem with CC's is they are reversible, so not a lot of exchanges out there for them.
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:55:20
And I will be needing at some point to exchange my btc to new coin and viceversa. 
It all comes down to that. Another extra step, more hassle, another extra fee. Less user-friendliness.
For an analogy, I've been seeing this since the birth of Linux. It is the best OS out there. It is also (one of) the least user-friendly. 
(over)Fragmentation in the name of open source had its cost: the whole linux distribution landscape became so huge and complex, that it became impractical (and very very hard to understand) for regular joe users. As a result, barriers to entry were created in every possible form. Only when big distros realized the regular joe's can't be bothered to learn stuff like compiling, the panorama changed. ( disclaimer: i use slackware distro, one of the hardest &amp; oldest ones..)
This is IMHO the reason Linux is only becoming mainstream now, almost 25 years after its birth; when it could have easily happened in 5-10 years.
I fear the same thing is happening to Bitcoin, another open source endeavor. 
Every new project regarding Bitcoin should take a very close look at itself and ask:
Am I adding or removing complexity?
If the answer is not clear or there is a shadow of complexity, maybe it's time to reassess the situation.
You may not feel you are creating complexity, but just take this whole post as an example. 
You, the creator of proposal, failed to clearly explain or articulate in one line or paragraph what exactly it is you are proposing. Yes, I can read the clearly well written paper, but how many regular joe's will do that? 
(being able to completely convey a project in one line is a ~~very common practice~~ MUST for anyone planning to have an interview with a VC or angel investor)
How will you convince the regular joe to support an idea so complex it cannot be explained in one sentence?
And finally, I do like and think good of your concept. I'm simply acting as devil's advocate, and pointing out a trend I, personally, see growing.

The alternative is to really invest the time to know and implement good security practices. 
RAID systems, dual cross-site backups, 2 or 3 step verifications, etc. Real security measures.
Buying a little brick that claims to be everything you need is just the way to lure people into false states of security and allow them to never invest time in the things they should really know.

I don't know if you even took the time to read and analize that post, but he is giving solid ( each person will then internalize this advice and use/discard it ). 
Furthermore, the answers in that post clearly show most of the redditors participating are completely ignorant in regards to common and simple financial terms such as "technical weakness", further proving the OP's point.
Maybe, we should be aware of you. What's your agenda? Why are you pulling the other way?
As far as I see it: 
Experienced trader post: rich analysis based on solid financial knowlegde (in contrast with the ignorant answers)
This post: ZERO analysis.

Excusing yourself like this and saying there is a confusion is distracting you from the obvious truth: you are being a conformist ignorant who instead of doing the proper research, claims there is a confusion.
Make no mistake: There is no room for confusion whatsoever in the OP's post, he is speaking in clear pin-point precise economic terms. Every single one of the "confused" redditors here is just an ill-informed (lazy?) wannabe.

All true, but even so, productive criticism will usually get your message a lot further than full on bashing.

I don't know why everyone is upvoting Yes as the answer. 
The answer is a resounding NO. 
They are just two different ways of looking at the charts, and obviously (as with almost everything) it absolutely depends on the TA you're doing and the kind of information you're trying to infer from the charts.
Please, don't fool yourself into thinking one is better than the other. You should be looking at the charts BOTH ways, and your conclusions should always reflect that.

@_date: 2013-06-09 21:57:34
Both of your intuitions are somewhat  correct, let me expand:
Ideally, local exchangers should be the way BUT remember we have a black market dollar. Thus we have an official dollar rate 1 usd = 5~ pesos and a "blue dollar" (black market) rate of 1usd = 8-9~ pesos.
Local sellers are obviously selling at blue dollar prices, so that makes it really costly. If one could find an open heart altruist btc magnate to sell at official rate, that's jackpot.'
Your second case is more realistic, and it is based on money exchange arbitrage and not a btc thing itself, but yes, it's possible and it is being done, a lot. 
In such a scenario I can buy stuff for you on the internet at a (new) credit card dollar rate (official rate + 25%, this is forced by gov' on visa, master, etc.), and you give me btc. Now I've got some BTC and I can hoard and hope for the future; or I could try and do some arbitrage selling in black market, but of course if acquiring btc was hard, imagine how hard it will be to get some liquid USD from my btc, to go and sell in BM.
I have recently found a loophole, where I get a web debit card (mastercard) with a valid ACH, to which I should withdraw my BTC to USD exchange. I then must buy a plane ticket, travel abroad, go to an ATM, withdraw my USD, smuggle them back in and sell in black market.
Of course, after all of these hassles, fees, travel costs, and the inherent criminality of it all.... gains are minimal to non-existant.
EDIT: Realistically, the overall best investment for anyone here (or elsewhere) would actually be to start large scale ASIC mining farm, given we are paying 1/8 the electricity costs. But you would have to be very very very lucky to a) get an avalon unit (at it's official price, not the 10-20x resell price they are going for) and b) smuggle them from the US to Arg.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:13:15
Yes and no. 
Technically, they are fully optional. You are free to send your BTC without any fees. 
In real practical terms though, you really should throw in the fees unless you are ready to wait a loooong time before your money arrives. In the meantime, unless you have a well organized wallet, you'll probably fall into double-spending patterns and other such problems. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 18:41:02
You are trying to delude yourself.
There are only two paths for you:
1. Assume BFL is scam. Case closed. Buy some BTC dividend paying stock instead. ASICMINER-PT is paying almost 50% annual dividends.. You are buying stock of a mining company whose mining profits get payed as div's.
2. Take whatever money you're planning on investing in BFL as a HIGH risk investment and do it anyway, knowing it will possibly end up being 0. Problem is, usually HIGH risk investment provides a HIGH return opportunity, which ISN'T true in your case. A BFL unit will give you a sustained rapidly decreasing return, and once difficulty gets too high, your unit will be obsolete, useless and worthless (stocks you can still sell..). 
In conclussion, for the same money you could buy some other HIGH risk asset, with a much greater return opportunity.

Hi there, 
You can buy BTC with just your Credit Cards, at [VirWox](
You will need to do the following: 
1. Deposit USD to [VirWox]( through CC or Paypal
2. In [VirWox]( exchange: USD &gt; Linden dollars (SLL)
3. In [VirWox]( exchange: Linden dollars (SLL) &gt; BTC
4. Withdraw BTC from [VirWox]( to your wallet
This is one of the only ways you can acquire BTC with just a CC, but it has some major drawbacks: high fees from every exchange step, new accounts have limits on how much you can buy and also on new accounts, you have to wait 72hs on your first withdrawal (one-time only).
Good luck!
