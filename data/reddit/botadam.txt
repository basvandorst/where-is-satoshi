If I buy now the bubble will explode. I'm waiting for someone with as much bad luck as me to buy first.

So if I understood correctly, the % of inflation/deflation will simply auto balance. And yes I'm a little bit confused. I used to hate economics, but discovering bitcoin made me think about it and it's actually very interesting.

Not that hard, open Excel. One column for money spent, one column for price of Bitcoin and then you can easily obtain the average price.

I did an oral presentation about it in front of 50 people last week at college. 
It might explain the recent ATHs.

It seems good. I didn't read it in details though. 
I have only one remark:
On my phone (S6) the tables are hard to read. 
The words are displayed vertically. 
Edit: in landscape mode everything is fine. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:00:41

The mania phase ''Oh my God this is it! Fiat is going down!'' and 1 hour later after a drop in the charts ''Bitcoin has reached his limits''.. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:32:44
Could you explain please? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:23:16

Thanks you for the links. I began to read them, I will finish later. 
Yes I already admitted that actual money is thin air based on a system artificially kept alive. 
If we consider the image you linked, yes the system ''rob'' us via the classic money. But concerning bitcoin, my issue is that the ones who hold can buy more and more but the guys who create value in the economy are getting robbed. Let's take your example:
The consumers will get more and more apples each year because bitcoin's value will get higher and higher. But the guy who sell the apples is getting less and less money each year. 
The problem is that maybe one day he'll consider that working and selling those apples isn't needed anymore. He just has to hold his savings.Now if everyone working in agriculture or the industry start thinking like the apples seller, nobody will want to work anymore, so no more value is created and the system collapse.
Is my understanding of deflation correct? 
If yes, How can we avoid the collapse?
