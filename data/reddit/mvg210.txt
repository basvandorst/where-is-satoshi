As someone who lives in California, along with millions of computer programmers in the state who would be building out the app layer of Bitcoin, this bill will seriously sidetrack the progress of development.

The barrier to entry shouldn't be $5000 to run a full bitcoin node, or create a bitcoin project at school or for a research project. 
Silicon Valley 2.0 would have never came into existence if there were similar restrictions to create an internet company back in 2000.

After finding out what your audience will be, this might make it a little easier. Ask your audience if they've ever played sudoku... And let them know that all miners are doing... Trying to figure out a puzzle/big sudoku game every ten minutes, with 25btc going to the winner of each game/block. 
This game automatically adjusts for difficulty based on the participants/miners in the sudoku/mining game, and because of the way it's designed, just like a sudoku game it's impossible to cheat and encourages the participants to be honest, and keep the Blockchain valid. And if someone DID figure out how to bypass this system, they'd have a billion dollars overnight and probably a Nobel prize for his/her math skills.

Just because they aren't doing exactly what the developers at Blockstream wants to do, doesn't mean they are "undermining the trust of the ecosystem".
Just because YOU follow whatever Blockstream says doesn't mean Coinbase doesn't get to experiment with possibly better versions of Bitcoin.

You'd need ~$100 to get a self sufficient Node running on solar power with a Rasberry Pi:
The new Pine64+ looks like a better fit for than a Rasberry Pi 2, but it hasn't hit the market yet. 2gb of ram, quad-core, 64 bit computer for $30. 
Anyways there is this guy Chris Ellis that just made a bunch of Nodes for a crowdfunding campaign, and he promised to release a video/tutorial on how he did it soon:

How do I use Javascript to make a sidechain app?
Something like a predictive market...
@_date: 2015-06-02 04:13:30
Yes, the code works as expected thanks! 
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:28:01
    var transaction = new Transaction()
        .from(utxos) // Feed information about what unspend outputs one can use
        .to(address, amount) // Add an output with the given amount of satoshis
        .change(address) // Sets up a change address where the rest of the funds will go
        .sign(privkeySet) // Signs all the inputs it can
    
This is from the Bitcore example website, but what I'm trying to figure out is the uxto part... what makes a uxto? Looks like from this example it involves a hash and a script, among other things:
    var utxo = new UnspentOutput({
      "txid" : "a0a08e397203df68392ee95b3f08b0b3b3e2401410a38d46ae0874f74846f2e9",
      "vout" : 0,
      "address" : "mgJT8iegL4f9NCgQFeFyfvnSw1Yj4M5Woi",
      "scriptPubKey" : "76a914089acaba6af8b2b4fb4bed3b747ab1e4e60b496588ac",
      "amount" : 0.00070000
    });
I don't know how to generate the txid to sign/broadcast the transaction, so once I figure out how to do that the process should be easier.

Sure, just use Node.js to watch an address, and when a payment is made you can trigger the Pi to do something, like take a picture, play a song or make a noise. The possibilities are endless!

Is your presentation more than 2 hours? If not, don't touch mining, it's a concept that make people even more skeptical about the tech.
At most explain that mining is when users who participate in the network donate their "engine"/computing power to validate transactions and that no one can steal from the blockchain.
Focus on how Bitcoin is different than traditional currency and remind them that even though Email.com doesn't exist, email is still the biggest social network we have today. Bitcoin is a protocol, a platform for digital ink on a crowdsourced parchment.

According to people actually from Greece, it's not exactly Silicon valley geeks who are rich and willing to deal with the BS of securing keys and spending a wildly fluctuating asset like bitcoin.
They seem more like the  grab the USD/EUR and stuff it under the mattress type. If this was a financial crisis in a place like... Romania... then it would make more sense because of the history with computer science/hackers over there.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:33:58
Offer it as an option but remember even a slight percentage in rates can cost them a lot of money. It's an industry that definitely could use bitcoin though, so why not have it start with you?

    var Chain = require('chain-node');
    var chain = new Chain({
        blockChain: 'bitcoin'
    });
    
    var req = {
        inputs: [{
            address: "PUT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE",
            // Private key never leaves this process!
            private_key: "PUT_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
        }],
        outputs: [{
            address: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS",
            amount: 1000
        }],
        change_address: "PUT_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE"
    };
    
    chain.transact(req, function(err, resp) {
        console.log(resp);
    });
    
Chain was simpler to use. Enjoy!

The debate had candidates call for backdoors to encryption from all the major tech companies, and shutting down parts of the Internet the the terrorists use. Might be a good reason to invest in a currency that's uncensored and is based on encryption rather than a government controlled currency that politicians can change the rules of through legislation.

Email + Bitcoin:
A sender pays a nominal fee to send an email to someone they want to reach.
They only get charged if the recipient opens the email.
The recipient gets 90% of the fee paid by the sender, the service gets the other 10%.
This eliminates spam, and ensures that the senders message is read by the targeted market/person. Users can set their own custom fee to receive emails, and the service would provide reporting on the senders side to measure campaign effectiveness.

Sports + Bitcoin:
One-day long fantasy sports leagues, with each user paying a standard fee to enter the pool. A user selects his team of 5 players (for basketball) and pays the fee. All entries are public the funds are held in escrow until all the games are finished. 
Once all games are over, the highest scoring entrant gets BTC sent to a wallet of his/her choice. 
It's possible to make this automated, creating an API for sports scores and triggering off payments when a specific threshold is met (ex: LeBron gets a triple-double, everyone who wagered on that would automatically be cashed out to their respective addresses.)
Betting $ on fantasy sports has been legal ever since Bush excluded it from the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006:

I'm confused about Coinbase's stance on gaming with Bitcoin. In their terms of use, they state:


Hammercoin seems like it would qualify as "internet gaming", right? 
Also reading this article, the fantasy sports site Victiv (recently acquired by FanDuel) states that 


Can someone from Coinbase clarify this? I'd love to see more games use Bitcoin, it's one of the best use cases for Bitcoin adoption.

Not the best idea I've ever heard
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:00:46
The best argument for me is to be part of the transition from analog to digital in the currency world. A lot of people make money when there are big shifts in the way we do everyday things, and spending money over the Internet will become a daily thing for everyone on the planet in 5 years. ecommerce has only 3% of the total marketshare for retail spending, and Amazon is now valued more than Walmart. Also doesn't hurt to diversify
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:31:28
Think about it like this:
The blockchain is the World Wide Ledger, and the only way to make a mark on it is with the digital ink known as bitcoins.

one strategy is to split it up into thirds over say 2-3 months.
So if you wanted to invest 3k you would do 1k a month for 3 months, this way you can dip your toes in the water and have a little more time to average your cost basis.

This is a really great idea, I just wish you lived next to Times Square. If someone could do this mermaid highly populated city I think it would be an awesome example of the power of Bitcoin creating a job being paid by thousands volunteers across the world

What happens to a society that buy into bitcoin, only to be enslaved by it when it is revealed the government owns most of the coins? And can take away your bitcoins with some elementary hacking?

Use Gyft to buy gift cards to Amazon and Walmart. 
Use the Amazon card to buy groceries with Amazon Fresh, and use the Walmart card at Sam's Club to buy gas. Just doing that will contribute to the Bitcoin economy greatly

The market is reacting to the fact the DPR's bitcoins (5% of all BTC in circulation) are suddenly priced in now.

They hope the future price of a bitcoin will increase to 601% better than it's current price. Again, they'd see more profit if they bought BTC ourtight, but this is all a part of the miners fallacy.

Does this mean the rise in volume from China could be the result of a few day traders going wild with lots and lots of micro-transactions?

Definitely a good sign! Maybe the author is a redditor.... ?
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:46:22
mOst likely the biggest reason is for people trying to "flip" BTC for proift on localcoins or something.... otherwise why is it a big deal if your long on BTC for the next 10 years?
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:43:08
@_date: 2013-10-03 00:57:22
Are those bitcoins traceable? 
What if they use bitcoins to hire assasins that kill prominent bitcoin supporters.... DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:06:05
Remember that the ~ 2 billion people already connected to the Internet won't have the most benefit from this technology. 
It's the 5 billion unbanked that will gain freedom by this awesome new way of transacting cash. If the US doesn't do anything to promote innovation around this tech the BRIC countries will, and the US will fall from it's current status.
Don't let that happen Mr. Senator

I was afraid this would happen to me too... I feel bad man but if you're long on bitcoin this will just be a bump in the road in the long run... if that makes you feel any better
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:43:20
"Most people won't understand that bitcoin is, by its nature, untraceable"
That's kind of ironic haha
Cool story though I like reading science fiction about possible bitcoin futures
