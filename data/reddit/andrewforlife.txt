I agree with this guy. 100%

Thank you! It took me a while to figure it out, and I thought I could help other  'less-technologically-inclined' individuals out as well.

Well, I had to resend my verification letter and id to their email support and got access a few hours afterwards I believe. I think that they use a bot. 
Dwolla is more of an online banking system. A lot of stores are beginning to accept dwolla payments in lieu of credit/debit cards, and both parties benefit from lower transaction costs. If bitcoin lasts and becomes a bigger thing, then maybe Dwolla would accept bitcoin payments. You could trade btc for usd with mt. gox, send your usd to dwolla (takes maybe a day or two?), and then spend from dwolla, or use their bank transfer service to your checking account. I think that the transfer costs 25 cents for transfers over $10.

For you downvoters...

I'd sign up for Dwolla, it's pretty nice.

Please let me know which method you go with, if you don't mind.

Thank you kind sir. Nice posts, I'm downloading the bitcoinscript now! Great idea with making youtube videos. I did notice one small spelling error, the first text box shows 'conent' instead of content.

I've never done that, although I know that there is a larger fee for wiring money. Have you used that method? Does it take time for the funds to clear?

Could it be possible that bitcoin is being manipulated by major exchanges like gox?

back end hacked.

Thanks, and good point. My intent is that people will be able to obtain bitcoins quickly through this method, and then they'll be able to pursue the other methods once they have gotten used to the bitcoin environment and how bitcoin works. Believe me, it can be really intimidating to new people and hopefully they will pick up other methods once they figure things out. 
I'd encourage you to create a comprehensive guide for an alternative trading site if you have a chance.

So, you selling yet?
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:08:40
Maybe one of these days... lol

I think it's just trendy spots, no major stores yet. The dwolla smartphone ap has a map of retailers. You can always keep money separate in Dwolla and send it to your checking account when you think you may need it.

Yeah, I've tried to deposit directly from dwolla, but my account is in queue for the mt. gov photo id/address verification. I don't think I can directly deposit yet though. I was using coinbase a few months ago but that is pretty much useless now.
