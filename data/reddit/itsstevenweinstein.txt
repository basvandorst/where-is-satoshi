"Capital Investment" comes from banks, which use savings to invest in other areas. Holding BTC in a physical wallet is the equivalent of stuffing money under your mattress. This does not lead to capital investment.
I agree, inflation is a purely human construct that is caused by increasing the money supply faster than productivity gains.
Having well anchored inflationary expectations is not bad for the economy. 
Edit: because you forced me to google it, [deflation is unambiguously bad for the economy](

If I held onto $100 in cash since 1920, that would be beyond idiotic. If I invested $100 into the Dow in 1929, it would be worth nearly $20000 today.

Unless he pays for everything in BTC, fiat is 100% safer.
$1 = $1

The market can stay irrational longer than we can remain solvent. Even if fiat is doomed, if it takes 100 years for it to collapse, then OP shouldn't truly care about whether or not fiat is doomed

None have outperformed btc so far. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
"$1 = $1" simply means that you will not lose (or gain) purchasing power, because that is what normal business is conducted in. 
BTC's long term value is based on its viability as a currency. If the price is based on speculation, then people will buy btc expecting it to go up until they don't. After that, all bets are off

There are other investments you can make that will grow faster than inflation, that is a ridiculously low bar to measure. Since btc is a currency, it's value is derived from how many people accept it as a currency, and the certainty that it has as a storage of value, not in value appreciation over time.

Inflation is good for the economy, it pushes people to spend more. Diapers are worth $30, or 1/60th of a BTC today. Tomorrow, diapers will be worth $30. I have no fucking clue how much diapers will be worth in btc tomorrow
