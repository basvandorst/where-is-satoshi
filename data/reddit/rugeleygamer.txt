Whats the risk of using a Lightning wallet like E-clair without running a LN node? 
I've been told that it means i'm using someone elses node and they can take all my funds if they close the channel

There's no such thing as spam. If someone decided it would be a good use of their money to waste it on pointless transactions then fine. The miners will just make more fee profits 
Lets leave these stupid 2017 memes in the past. It was unironically such a cancerous time. Everyone spouting utter shit left right and center cause they were too busy watching the numbers go up to think about what they were saying. It nearly drove me away from bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:55:15
the trick is to always buy and sell at the same time, and then just get a job to cover the fees you're donating, then the profit is the left over money

Thats pretty nice...
Lets say you got enough sats in the custodial wallet that you'd like to take them into your own custody.. How hard would it be to get them on you own on-chain wallet? 
I also still have a problem with how few people will ever be able to *actually* have complete control over their bitcoin without using custodial services assuming we reach global adoption, unless some other miracle is invented

0fee transactions dont get in the way of even 1sat/byte transactions so its still a complete waste of time. also an unavoidable design flaw in the protocol (but its made irrelevant by the block size limit. more effective when used against unlimited blocks as you can effectively make a massive 5petabyte block chain basically for free in a single block, in theory)

Never use a VPN to make a bitcoin wallet... you have no idea who's at the other end of that VPN.
All wallets should be generated offline, and disconnected from the internet. I do it on a Linux USB boot for additional security.
I need to launder my bitcoins too.. I think the way I'm going to do it is to send them to an Exchange that doesnt use KYC or save my identity, trade for monero, send them to a monero wallet, then back to the exchange on a different account, trade for BTC and put back into cold storage. Haven't done it cause it sounds like a ball ache, but I guess that could work? Risky tho, probably would involve some dodgy exchange I dont trust so I'm still not sure. I think im just gonna keep them in their current wallets and if Gubberment asks: "dunno i sent them to a grill for feet pics". They cant tell me im lying lmao

clearly not, anyone who thought it would even be remotely significant has thinking problems
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:35:18
I remember a time when people WERE claiming that it would be the new global monetary system. Bitcoin maximalists still do so every day. I dont know when bitcoin became an unambitious project but I wish it still had its ambition. If it cant be global money, it cant be anything, itll never achieve adoption of any sort of significance. which makes it completely worthless
LN was meant to be the scaling solution, and now discovering that even LN cant support more than a few million people. Depressing.
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:50:33
Ok let me rephrase for you since you have a hard time understanding what I just said.
The bitcoin blockchain has a max theoretical block weight of ~4MB since segwit became active. That means maximum of 8000/day.... blah blah.. 420 million TX per year.
I don't know if you're actually aware of this, judging by your response, but in order to open a Lightning network channel two parties have to send an ON CHAIN transaction. 
This locks the funds in a smart contract, in a nut shell how your funds get onto the LN.
So if 5 Billion people want to get on the LN, then thats gonna require 10 Billion transactions, (and thats only assuming 1 channel per person and never closing it etc).
Obviously I'm not saying those 10bn have to happen all at once, that can take a while but as his mathematics explains, itll currently take around 50 years with 1MB blocks, which is a little bit too much of a bottleneck
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:57:24
disprove me. seriously please do it.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:34:18
The counter argument is that 1000 $1 transactions are a better way of fulfilling a fee market than 1 £1000 transaction
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:25:18
By using a larger transaction you can, but that still takes up as much block space as 2 transactions, and it still doesnt address the point anyway.
I told you you'd need 10 billion transactions to have 5 billion different individuals open a channel. Thats assuming only one channel open. 10 Billion. Address the point please?
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:17:07
How is that different to banking?

oh yeah.. ON PAPER ��
That fakepedia page was a barrel of laughs too. 
I'm so sick of these fucking companies pushing their snake oil "hardware wallets", it does the SAME THING as a piece of paper. It STORES YOUR PRIVATE KEYS!!!!!! 
And you should be printing out 2 or three copies of your keys in case one gets water damaged, or laminating, etc whatever the fuck you feel is necessary, as long as you dont be a retard and cut it up into little bits and hide it so well even you cant find it.

i agree 100% with the first part of your comment, but the third option defies all logic and mathematics
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:58:34
You have no idea how relieved I am to hear someone say that, I was starting to question my own sanity.
We refused the block size increase in 2017 because we didnt want a "simple fix" and that encouraged people to build L2, but L2 cant scale on its own. There eventually needs to be block size increase as well in order to even reach L2.

download ubuntu live onto a usb stick (easy video tutorials, its a 1 minute job)
right click, save as onto the USB stick
unplug your ethernet cable, or disconnect from wifi.
reboot pc, and hit del or f10 or whatever takes your bios to boot options before windows, and select boot from USB device
load the live ubuntu OS, and open the bitaddress site you saved
generate 7 keys with no art, print them off twice (incase you lose one) and there you have it. be careful about ever plugging that USB stick into your pc again, if you're paranoid about bots looking for this exact process
90% of those people telling you to buy a $100 flash drive theyre calling "hardware wallets" are paid to tell you that, but im not saying they dont work. papers better though. you need paper to write hte seed for the hardware wallet anyway for when the flash storage inevitably corrupts and you lose your coins
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:59:19
My point is perfectly valid, you are either stupid or trolling.

YUO DISAGREE? YUO ARE A TROLL
Trolling is a way of angering people by being dumb, immature, and never properly responding to debates. Someone who is trying to have a rational debate is not a troll. You on the other hand, have produced no valid points other than "PLEBBITOR 4 7 WEEKS LOL" which is classic trolling, now fuck off
@_date: 2019-01-09 20:31:43
no you cant be your own bank, because they can inflate TX fees so high that its not viable for you, refuse to connect to your LN node etc etc.
You cant have partial decentralisation. Actually about to sell all my BTC unless someone can give me a proper answer, this is mad. Cant believe I never noticed this before
@_date: 2019-01-12 21:56:25
No, thats not how debates work. I've given you my point, and now you need to produce a rebuttal. Stop trying to pass it off back to me just because you haven't got one.
~200m transactions a year maximum at the moment. 2 transactions required to open a LN channel. Absolute maximum of 100m LN channels opened per year (presuming the blockchain isnt used for anything else). It would take like 50 years of purely opening LN channels to achieve world adoption... Not gonna happen. 
Whats in the narrative? simple mathematics.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:30:16
these things will be obsolete if bitcoin ever becomes mass adopted so its a complete waste of time
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:06:29
im not advocating giant blocks, i asked what the solution was, because get this: when small blocks fail, big blocks will become inevitable. bitcoin wont die just because some fags on reddit are in a small block cult
i know why big blocks are bad, but they might become unavoidable if a real solution isnt found. fuck your insecure shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:13:13

uhhh yeah.. on paper.. what a waste of time

No they dont, because the HUGE banking cartel nodes, will just form their own secluded area of the lightning network, which will be A-OK for all the custodial wallet people who DO NOT OWN THEIR BITCOINS (Not your key, not your bitcoin. have we abandoned this principle too now?)
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:05:36
You morons who are saying" its ok, most people will use custodial lightning network channels". YOU MORONS!!!!! THE ENTIRE POINT OF LN IS TO NOT HAVE TO RELY ON CUSTODIAL SERVICES! WE MAY AS WELL JUST HAVE AN EXCHANGE FFS!!!

I. HAVE. NEVER. SAID. BITCOIN. NEEDS. TO. FULLY. SCALE. AT. LAYER. ONE.
IN ORDER.
TO GET.
TO LAYER TWO.
YOU MUST MAKE.
A LAYER ONE TRANSACTION.
Got it? Now whats the MAXIMUM channels that could open in AN ENTIRE YEAR? Approximately 210 Million (Top end estimate). Achieve this figure with simple mathematics. Do you see my point yet? 
Yes of course, we can continue work on LN to have it running like fucking clockwork for those who have already managed to open channels and are on the network, thats not my question. My question is 5 billion people getting onto L2 in the first place.

@_date: 2019-01-10 17:12:53

@_date: 2019-01-09 22:03:13
You got the first part right, but it's no good saying stupid meaningless but hopeful things like that, because LN clearly hasnt solved ANYTHING!
FFS!!!!!! Stop being delusional
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:17:41
No it wont be affordable for anyone to use the blockchain at all in the future unless we have a series of block size increases in the future as they start to become necessary.
But people won't allow block size increases to happen because it would be bad for the LN because you need to have a BTC node to run a LN node, and raising block sizes causes BTC node to be more expensive to run.
Sorry bud

Oh my god, just stop trying to transfer the blame and accept it. WE CONSUME ENERGY!!!!
YAS BITCOIN SLAAY!!
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:47:20
Fossil Fuels are the most effective source of energy we have, and therefore the cheapest.
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:06:36
implying fees are going to stabalise around 30usd. says who?
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:30:24
What a muppet. The reason we dont use solar panels to mine bitcoin, is because mining is incredibly competitive. The cheapest Energy will have the most profits, which is, you guessed it. FOSSIL FUELS.
He then talks about effectively "Lets just tax fossil fuels" whoa, did you come up with that one yourself? Completely impracticable answer to the problem, probably resulting from andreas' own cognitive dissonance. I remember him saying himself that the "obvious way" to solve a problem is usually the wrong way. Well I can tell him this is the wrong way. How many old people in England already cant afford to heat their homes, and you're going to try to establish a world wide (enforced by whom?) tax? Sure.
Using solar panels or wind turbines etc to mine BTC is an absolute fallacy. It wont happen until oil exceeds $200 a barrel world wide, and thats not going to happen because its currently costing Saudi Arabia $5 to produce a barrel.
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:50:11
thats not what i asked, buddy and i didnt say during on chain spam attack.
one day bitcoin will have huge global adoption, and thus massive on-chain fees. this isnt a question of lightning network micropayments
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:55:30
Harnessing that Energy from the Sun/wind is difficult, and is much less effective than combustion of fossil fuels. That is why "green energy" is more costly than fossil fuels, and you are wrong
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:37:04
He hasn't answered it. If he were to properly answer it, instead of just inventing pseudo-economic bullshit, and transferring the blame to another industry he would have just said "YEP. WE CONSUME A FUCK TONNE OF ENERGY, AND ITS BAD FOR THE PLANET. DEAL WITH IT." Because THATS THE TRUTH.
People don't like uncomfortable truths but there it is!
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:45:49
Spot on. Not only that but our manufacturing etc etc also becomes hugely uncompetitive. Game theory, impossible to do it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:59:06
its not though, because oil is produced for $5 a barrel (sold at a massive mark up). Solar energy would have to be about 10x more cost effective than fossil fuels today to have a renewable energy flippening, and its not even close
