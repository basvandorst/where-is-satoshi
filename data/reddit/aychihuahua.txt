I got this same email, too.
I use unique email aliases on my personal domain name for every website I use, primarily so I can automatically filter/label my incoming email, but also to track instances of stolen/sold email addresses.

I don't like these fancy names. As a new Bitcoin user, they don't make any sense to me and I can't relate them to units I'm already familiar with.
Is there a movement to break up the Bitcoin unit names into bits, kilobits, megabits, etc? I would like to get behind something like that.

I just subscribed after seeing the article on the front page. I set up my wallet and spent about 30 minutes collecting free Bitcoins. I have $0.01 in my wallet now! Maybe you could turn that into $1.00? ;)

I decided to finally get into Bitcoin after all the attention on the Reddit front page yesterday. I installed [Electrum]( to set up a wallet and a [generous redditor]( helped be get started with $0.99 worth of Bitcoin.
I'm just starting to grasp the whole concept, but I'm starting to get the hang of sending/receiving bitcoins. :)

You have an extremely poor attitude. You should work on your own inner beauty before you work on promoting your bitcoin naming system.

Does Steam/Valve have a registry of authorized distributors so consumers can verify if certain websites/companies are legitimate?

I have no idea. The URL is ` and the server does a 301 Redirect to `

People upvote based on the title but don't even click the link or read the comments. :(
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:04:38
It's because it redirects to a scam Bitcoin gambling site.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:17:57
From my understanding, the Bitcoin client you are using requires the whole blockchain to be downloaded. I am using [Electrum]( which handles that using a remote server. It is taking up only 40 MB of space and I have been able to send/receive payments without any issues.
PS: I just started using Bitcoins yesterday, so I'm still really new to this. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:29:31
Serious question, has there been any notable email spam/scam schemes that ask for Bitcoins instead of the usual bank wire transfer, etc?
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:40:39
You sent in your driver's license!? To an anonymous "organization"... 
Inputs.io didn't even ask for your full name or address. What use would a driver's license do for verifying your identity?
I sincerely hope that you don't find out your identity is stolen next, after having your BTC stolen.

In the last 30 days, we saw the rate climb from $175 to $750. That's about a 428% increase. Going from $750 to $5,000 would be about a 667% increase.
It does not seem outlandish at all to hit $5,000 within the next 12 months.

I am not OP, but I have unique email aliases for every website I use. Example: reddit facebook etc.
Primarily, I do this so I can automatically filter and label email. But it also helps track stolen/sold email addresses.
For example, when Adobe was compromised this year, I knew right away, because I got a phishing email sent to my 'adobe' email address.
