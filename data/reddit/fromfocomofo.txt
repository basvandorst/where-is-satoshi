Thank you. I've been a bit out of touch with the bitcoin community since early 2013.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:11:40
This isn't Yahoo answers.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:51:05
Because it doesn't matter what title you give the creators. What matters is the idea of Bitcoin, which already takes about 10 minutes to explain. Throwing in the concept of how a hacker can be a good thing is too much. In my opinion, you might as well avoid the chance of bias while still maintaining 100% accuracy in information and just call them developers. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:26
I don't see anything that says anything about canceling. I see a button that says "release transaction" which sounds like me just giving that other guy the money which is obviously not what I want to do...
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:49:47
So what is the purpose of the .dat file?
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:27:02
So where are my coins stored if they aren't in the wallet or on Blockchain or any other website? What happens when you have multiple .dat files but with balances for the same address? 
@_date: 2013-04-30 21:44:54
Go ask anyone who isn't tech savy what they think of when they hear the word hacker.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:25:06
I swear to god I'm never using this site again.

That's what they're doing.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:04:38
Well obviously I would talk about the real important stuff about how you control your own security of your Bitcoins. I'm not just saying "Bitcoin is a currency and created by developers! Bam!" and then just walking off. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:31:16
"If you can't pay your taxes with it, I don't think it will work." HA!

WOW yeah I totally thought it referred to a limit.

Cause of this:  
Theres no way its just going to stay way up like that.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:58:50
To me, and nearly everyone else on this planet, I don't think of a hacker as "hobbyist, who makes innovative customizations or combinations of retail electronic and computer equipment." I think of them as malicious people trying to disrupt websites and spying on my personal computer. Sure, they are hackers, but that doesn't mean that that is a very good title for them. The most proper title in my opinion, would be "developers." Cause that's what they did. They developed software that we all know as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:58:45
But I want results now!

I was really surprised by this article.
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:36:04
Did they ask people to specifically call them hackers?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:12
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:49:05
Valid point. Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say "intelligence community?"
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:03:34
Report that fucker to the police.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:19:45
Bitcoin escrow services exist: 
The reason I ask this question is because I can easily see PayPal going down the escrow route with PayPal, that market would be a piece of cake for them. I don't see why the don't embrace it. At the same time I seriously hope they don't. I know they would charge insane fees and it would just be stupid.

Yeah I've been getting a lot of flak for this. And I agree with it all. It shows how many smart people are on this subreddit so I really can't be upset :) I think this kind of post will be a lot more popular in a few years when this subreddit has more not-so-tech-savy people on it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:53:35
I feel like the law enforcement of the future is REALLY going to start cracking down on things like this. If bitcoin really takes off, there are going to be huge hacks where millions of bitcoins are stolen and that rich dude is going to get his fucking money back.... even if it means hiring an army of programers and hackers.
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:51:50
Proof please.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:33:30
That's what I'm hoping it is.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:03:22
Neither name is wrong. I'm just making the argument that "software developer" or more simply "developer," serves as a WAY better title than "hacker." To some people, yes, the definition may have a positive definition. But for everyone else that doesn't work with computers to some degree, they will think of criminal activity when they hear the term "hackers."
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:30:00
Yep Bitcoin Qt. I am no where near the 100 transaction mark either.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:28:45
You also have to explain how it runs on a peer-to-peer network where every peer checks every other peer. There's a finite amount of Bitcoins. Banks and governments cannot steal your money! Mining, wallets, why it's been so volatile lately.... I can see how Bitcoin can sound like a scam or scheme when you explain all of this. And then you drop the fact that this was all created by "hackers" to a not-computer-literate person, and there is a great chance you've lost them. I want to make the idea sound as attractive as possible. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:37:51
Not only would it really legitimize Bitcoin by showing it doesn't function purely off of the Silk Road, other black market sites will pop up in it's place, making the market for Bitcoin even better. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:02:02
I know the difference. I'm just speaking for the not so computer literate... which is at least 90% of the people out there.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:09:04
Well this sounds like a major flaw then doesn't it?
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:27:44
Even Bill is bringing up the possibility of the Bitcoin being regulated by governments. Not too long ago the CEO of Google said the same thing. This is scary.

This actually reassures me a little bit. I'll have to look into how this has been used in the past to for more details.

I'm going to take your advice and get away from this monitor. I know for an (almost) absolute fact that the value is going to go up regardless. Stressing about this right now is pointless.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:25:58
You're totally right. Bitcoin is more of an idea than software. There are many ways to implement that which is Bitcoin. Thank you.

@_date: 2013-04-30 18:41:10
Here's what I said to another Redditor who had the same argument "I and the tech-savy community understand that. 98% of the world doesn't. Therein lies the problem. You can either explain that concept to them, or skip it and just call them developers while still maintaining 100% accuracy in your dialogue. If you call them hackers, many people out there might get wierded out thanks to the news. I just avoid the chance of bias and call them developers.
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:49:48

How would they even help? Bitcoin does everything that they can do plus more. So what do they have to offer to Bitcoin besides exposure?
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:22:15
The problem with that argument is that most people in this world recognize the fact that most Muslims are good people and it's just the few asshole Muslims among them making news. Can't say the same thing about the word "hacker." The term "hacker" has been pretty much skewed by the not-so-tech-savy in a way that the title "Muslim" hasn't.
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:36:20

@_date: 2013-04-30 17:37:59
I agree. I've heard those terms before but that's because I'm a web developer and "I'm in with the nerds." Most people don't understand those terms.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:14:00


In my opinion, no. You run the risk of the other persons' bias ruining the opportunity. 


You're totally right. Bitcoin already takes a while to explain. But if you HAVE to bring it up, call them developers. You avoid the chance of getting played the bias card.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:43:56
Because Bitcoin. The main goal is to get the person on board a currency system that is worlds better than 99% of what is out there. If you call them hackers, you run the risk of that persons' ignorant bias getting in the way. You already have to give them a lot of information when it comes to Bitcoin. If the person you're talking to doesn't have the mental energy to listen to you, you might as well leave out what is not so important such as "hackers can actually be a force for good." Calling them developers is still 100% correct. It also comes with the benefit of not having anything negative associated with it. Yes ideally they should know the correct definition of hacker but how feasible is that when they already have to listen to you for 10 minutes to explain a the concept of Bitcoin?
I completely agree with you though.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:58
And if you think about it, it's self promoting too. Person A buys bitcoin and then wants persons A B C D.... to all buy bitcoin so that the value of Person As bitcoin is worth more! Really selfish for Person A but it spreads the word about a system that works.

@_date: 2013-04-30 22:25:12
The reason I bring up Fox News is because I've seen them call the creators of Bitcoin "hackers," which I obviously disagree with and is definitely relevant to my point.
I legitimately loathe that news network. It is a news network controlled by the elite to manipulate people and squash anything that challenges the status quo. It is a very negative entity in this world. I only go to Fox News to see what stance our corrupt leaders have taken and for the LOLs. I'm sorry you don't feel the same way. You can find SOME good information on Fox, but that same info can easily be found elsewhere. Simply put, there is little to no reason to listen to Fox News.
Sorry if I lost you at Fox News. It was relevant and you obviously take Fox News more serious than I do. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:15:00
Very true. Did not consider this. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:53:10
I agree. This is what you get when you get a bunch of computer-illiterate people trying to make tech-related laws. They can make laws but they are going to have to be tyrants to enforce them. There's no way they can know who has what amount of money without stealing peoples laptops.

@_date: 2013-04-30 22:01:48
I'm not even coming close to lying though. If they want to know who created it, I'll tell them, a group of Japanese developers. If you ask Fox News, it was a group of anonymous hackers. Both answers are correct. I am admittedly being biased, but I won't give wrong facts.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:12:03
When hackers hacked Sony Playstation Network. When hackers hack  any government website (this mostly makes sheeple angry). When hackers took down MtGox. There are a ton of "bad" hackers out there who have pretty much ruined the reputation of the name for most people who are not computer literate. There are definitely good hackers out there like the people who took down the Westboro Baptist church. But people seem to only remember the bad things.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:04:14
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:17:39
...but they are also in the self-driving cars, and mapping out the whole world and providing email address and providing a server with which you can upload 20,000 songs and stream from that server whenever you want for free business! So why would bitcoin be something they would not get into?
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:36:18
Just delete this post. You're wrong and you're only going to scare people with false info. Delete it.

Fuck off. This provides no real insight into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:05:38
I was going to say it seems to me like most of the real work was done philosophically on a chalk board... deciding WHAT Bitcoin is and how it works. The technology used to implement it is very rudimentary.

@_date: 2013-04-30 23:39:29
You're totally right. But in this case, i would be explaining that right in the middle of explaining Bitcoin which already takes a while. If my listener can stomach it, sure I'll explain it to them.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:43:34
Damn. No it wasn't a blockchain wallet. It was a QT wallet. I need that .dat file right?

@_date: 2013-05-01 14:47:55
Honestly it's at a great price right now. I'm surprised it's this far. But to answer your question, I think the SMALL dips might have to do with the Silk Road getting constantly DDoSed.

I am by no means an experienced trader. This is giving me grey hairs.
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:49:15
That is a very misleading title. All Silk Road did was offer up a reward to ANYONE who can help. Never specifically mentioned asking police for help. Downvote.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:15:39
Even just calling them "developers" would be more appropriate title for the average person who is not computer-literate. Is Bitcoin not software? Software needs developers to develop... Is my logic here flawed?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:42:14
Valid argument. They definitely have earned the title of hackers. But that's not the point. The main goal is to convey the idea of Bitcoin. It doesn't matter what title you give the creators... as long as the title is correct by definition (and preferably doesn't scare them away!) Calling them a developer eliminates the risk of their bias going "oh wait they are hackers? They must be terrrrible people!" (say that using a your old grandmas voice for the LOLs). I avoid the risk of bias and just call them developers. Nobody gets hurt, correct info is still being supplied and progress is still made.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:05:19
When I first saw that on the front page I was like "oh no.... people are really gonna be sketched out about this now." Which they very well could be at this point. But as soon as I went into the comments I was pleasantly surprised at how people were correcting the misinformed.

It's going back up right now

I totally agree. May I ask you, are you a web developer or work with computers in any way or consider yourself tech-savy?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:44:22
***IF*** there is a bounce, yes it will be epic.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:46:40
That sounds exactly like what I was wondering about. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:15:38
I agree I should have used a better title.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:28:00
Cause to an ignorant tech-savy dude like me, Google seems to have really good ethical business practices, and they know how to create products that the customer likes. That and they handle more visits than any other site in the world. There servers would be very hard to launch a DDoS attack on against. It could be anyone really. Or multiple companies. Just not MtGox. Fuck them.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:22:33
Even Eric Schmidt says that he doesn't know whether Bitcoin is going to be legal.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:43:20
As a person who works in the tech industry, I completely agree.
@_date: 2013-04-30 18:00:23


Let's think about the number of people you're talking about. And then think about how many people are on this planet. To a very few people, the meaning "hacker" has a positive definition. To everyone else, probably thanks to the news, they would associate hackers with criminals. 98% of people aren't as tech savy as you and I.
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:10:01
How would bitcoin be able to completely separate itself from the banking system of the US?
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:47:16
Stop it. You're only hyping up the panic sellers. You want to really see the value shoot up? Stop focusing on value and try and spread the word about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:31:53
That was just stupid.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:03:31
Valid point. My only intention is to spread Bitcoin. My method of getting that done will include calling the creators developers. Nobody is going to get pissed because 
1. I am still maintaining 100% accuracy in what I am telling to the person wanting to hear about Bitcoin. Logically, everything created needs a developer. Houses, books, chairs... were all created by developers by definitions. Considering the term "developer" is thrown around so much in the tech industry as it is, it is very appropriate to call them that in this case. 
2. It doesn't matter who created it. What matters is the idea of Bitcoin. So choosing a title for these people is irrelevant as long as the title is correct by definition.
I understand hackers themselves may feel like they aren't getting the credit they deserve but who cares when the people of Bitcoin decided to stay anonymous. They obviously don't want us to know who they are and they could probably care less what title people give them. All I'm saying is calling them hackers my make your plans backfire thanks to ignorant bias.

How did you sell and buy so quickly?
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:37:20
Yes. Especially when those peoples' bias can turn them away from Bitcoin just cause of what they heard from Fox News. Simply calling them "developers" takes out the chance of their bias screwing it up while still maintaing 100% accuracy. Plus it's not about their title. It's about the idea of Bitcoin that you want to get across. It's just that if you call them hackers, you run the chance of people being sketched out.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:17:28
I completely agree. It just doesn't seem time-efficient to explain Bitcoin and how hackers can be a good thing when explaining Bitcoin already takes 10 minutes. It's definitely got to be done though.
