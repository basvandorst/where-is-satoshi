I have a feeling that Litecoin and Ethereum probably get more volume by association with Bitcoin via the Coinbase app. Consider all of the new people downloading Coinbase to get bitcoin. Then they see Litecoin and Ether and probably just throw a little bit of money into those too for fun basically. 
This is obviously not the only reason or the driving factor, but I think there is an extremely high probability that people have bought Litecoin and Ether without doing any research just because Coinbase has made it so easy.

My fucking god, I’ve been glued to the charts all morning. This is crazy! It just went from 17k to 18k in I think 10 minutes lmao

You’re not kidding. I came to reddit as soon as I saw it hit 17k. Saw this post a minute later and went to check the price again and it was above 17.5k!

Hahaha! Then 19k 3 minutes later!

I noticed that too. And then soon after (or before, can’t remember) it was hanging at 12,750.00

Doesn’t the seller usually eat that fee? That’s how I see it in the US at least, except for gas it seems. But if I go to the grocery store I’m charged the same whether I pay cash, credit or debit.

I don’t get lounge access with my card but I have gotten over a thousand bucks in points and promotions and always make my payments in full each month. My favorites are the Chase Credit card promos. Sign up and spend $3,000 in the first 3 months and get $300 cash back. I’ve done that one 3 times. Put all of my bills and groceries on it and don’t spend a dollar more than I would have to begin. Feels like free money. There are no fees and I don’t pay interest because I pay in full each month.
You just have to wait 6-12 months before closing the card, and then an additional 6-12 months before you’re eligible again. But they haven’t stopped me from doing that and I do the same for their checking account promos. Just need to set up direct deposit. No fees, no catch, just the inconvenience of having my paycheck direct deposit split and sent to a second account. I have and love BTC but it hasn’t produced any tangible benefit for me yet.
