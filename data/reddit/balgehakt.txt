How could it be? It's not like you can confiscate something that is untraceable, and the system as a whole transcends borders.

Aren't they based on the daily average though?

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. It might just be buying a penny stock for 2 dollars before it goes too 100. The chance to buy hundreds of coins for very little money has left the station, but if you still have faith that bitcoin will stay around for longer, then there is plenty of reason to buy into it now.

Yeah, it kind of sucks that I didn't look further into the concept and prospects of bitcoins when I bought 10 of em a few months ago to spend on SilkRoad for about €9,- each. It's hindsight, but I was pretty confident in the future of bitcoins then, I just didn't think of trying to capitalize on it. Ah well, guess I'll just have to see what the future holds for my more expensive coins now. 
By the way, I think it will scare away some investors, but on the other hand it might attract some as well. The ability for bitcoins to fill the niche that SilkRoad creates does seem to add to its value, though I still agree that in light of it appearing more legitimate it would be better if the link wasn't constantly made.

Is that the case? btc-e, for example, seems fine to me, although I haven't tried trading anything.

I'm not really pulling my hair out, because it's all just hindsight, but I do feel slightly disappointed that I didn't look into the prospects of bitcoins further when I bought a bunch a few months back at a third of today's price. I was already positive about the future of bitcoin, but it just didn't really cross my mind that I could use that to make money. Still, it doesn't matter, I think I still got into the game relatively early, albeit with an amount of coins that is pretty insignificant to most. 
I don't think waiting for a dip is a smart strategy at the moment though. Personally I opted to buy for an amount that I can consider completely lost without it affecting me too badly. In that sense, the only way to go is up.

Hmm, the prices always seem quite high to me except when you look at buying higher quantities at once or when you are looking at RCs and comparing them to RC prices on the clearweb. Where are you from?
Besides that, drugs have pretty high profit margins in general, most of which is the result of them having to change hands a lot of times before they make it to the customer. I guess that is still the case for most dealers on SR, but I'd also guess that there are some who are actually close to the source who are making big bank now, because they can charge highly inflated prices now that they are able to get in touch with their customers themselves without having to do something risky like selling on the street.

I wasn't planning on doing anything, and there sure as hell isn't any point in trying now. 40 mins now, unbelievable. Didn't they halt trading before when it got to 15 mins or so? I don't understand why they seem to be letting this happen.

I wonder if there are any dealers who kept their assets, or at least some of their assets, in bitcoins over the past few months. Selling 10k worth of drugs and seeing it turn into 30k must be quite amazing.

So you have about 14 BTC worth of LTC now? Not bad! 
I turned .18 BTC into 82 LTC myself a while back (just in case, and it gave me a nice round number of BTC), which are now worth 1.3 BTC. I have no idea why Litecoin is gaining so fast, but I don't mind either way. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 03:37:14
Haha, I completely missed the point of your Bitcents bit and figured I should spend a few bucks to buy into that as well. Spread my chances and such. Doh! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:39:31
Seems to be getting worse every time though. Lag is at 35 mins now, it's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 03:48:55
Doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. Being a dealer with an investment strategy probably puts you ahead either way. I know nothing about the difficulty involved in that trade, but I do know that if I had a steady stream of bitcoins coming in, I would keep a portion of it to see what happens to them, assuming that I would have enough left for living expenses and other things. Besides that, it seems like a good plan to have some of your assets in a format that essentially can't be seized.

You could have made that same point at $10,- per coin though, yet the people who bought in at that point have seen their coins triple in value over the course of a few months. The fact that you could have made more money if you started sooner does not mean that you can't make a lot now. Sure, the future is quite uncertain, but as long as you believe that the coins will still be around for years to come, the prospects are still great. This point isn't that much different than any previous one, you either believe in its future or you don't.
