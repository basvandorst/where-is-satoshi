I suggested this a while ago. I also wrote the code for it. 
You can find it all here

32mb is as far as we can go. There are what's called "type constraints" in the bitcoin core. If we want to supports more than 32mb we have to do some more serious code refactoring. You might think we should do that now rather than later so we can avoid another tiring discussion, but neither bip is in support of that decision. Also some argue that in the future when 32mb isn't enough, we will know how to deal with it better.

Dope. I cant wait to mycelium has this feature.

I'm all over the place. Some days BIP 100 looks good, some days BIP 101 is the obvious solution. Overall, I think that no matter what the block size is, we will (as humans) be able to scale up operations. Businesses need to hold a full node at all costs if they intend on being a bitcoin merchant of some sorts. Capitalism will keep bitcoin decentralized and we should be okay either way. I am currently pro-100 because I like voting, but its still in draft so... *shrug*  
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:41:23
Why not just say Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin 1.0 then. You seem to be implying bitcoin core is old technology when you compare it like "Bitcoin 1.0 vs Bitcoin XT" I think you weren't trying to make a statement however and I just misunderstood you. I realise you where simply clarifying now. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:39:49
I really like this idea and I appreciate you making my bitcoins easier to secure, but my neckbeard is wary. If you are unwilling to opensource the entire project it makes me very unmotivated to assist in you're beta program. If it were open source I could maybe help port it to my phone or poke around and make your app more secure. I also feel like you could make  more money because it could be a better product if you open sourced it. Thanks, but no thanks until you make it open.
Edit: The team says that they will open source everything that they can, legally speaking.

Shameless plug
Come visit us over at gobithib.com! Its being made by an MIT student to incentivise contributing to opensource

If XT switches to 8mb blocks before BIP 101 is accepted than they will be compatible for a few months, but after that BIP 101 will become incompatible with XT
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:22:32
That's really unfortunate. Well in that case I'll keep an eye out. I can't participate in the beta because I have a oneplus one, but thank you for being understanding and answering all my questions in a professional manor. Good luck guys!

Why is it not up to you to open source.

@_date: 2015-08-28 05:31:33
Two thoughts on that.
1) We could use lighthouse to fund it each month
2) I think that Good Mythical morning Has a very cheap fee probably. Cheaper than bitcoin bowl.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:52:33
Sorry you're right. I meant to type 100.
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:18:51
Yep, if you use this tool improperly you could totally loose your funds. Fortunately the author made the tool open source so that you can verify your download and run the script client side. This tool doesnt need ssl because its intended to be downloaded. If you download it from github than you have nothing to worry about. If you download it by save-as-ing the page than you might get javascript injected in there anyway but that's besides the point. I think the website is a demonstration for what the tool looks like. You're not supposed to actually use the website. Even if you do than it blatantly advertises to use a temporary wallet with funds in it that you can afford to use.
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:37:47
So is your problem with the code then. You have migrated from talking about ssl not being available to talking about how the code is just shitty. Maybe you are just trying to say that all existing implementations of javascript are flawed and thus a bitcoin app in javascript can not work without you getting your funds stolen. I'm just saying that if you use the code as it was intended to be used, you will be just fine. I used the app online without ssl and I checked all the traffic that was sent from my computer. (Admittedly if they put the key through some sort of cipher or something I wouldnt be able to see it but) I didnt see my private key anywhere in the logs.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:55:33
What? I'm not trying to be mean or anything so I am sorry about that. This is what I originally should have said. Once you download the webpage (from github or just the website) and audit it however (checksum) to verify it wasnt tampered with, you should be good to go. The fact that this website doesnt have any ssl probably doesnt help. It would be better if it had ssl so some attacker in the middle couldnt randomly inject js in. The website should say "Download this page locally" but other than that I think its fine.
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:40:27
I just saw the ecoins post as well. I was equally jealous. You might want to try out [shipito]( it could help and they accept BTC. Another thing I might mention is this from the official FAQ


@_date: 2015-09-09 21:37:39
As long as you don't mind the [unverified limits](
@_date: 2015-09-08 18:22:14
I think you should compile gcore on a separate Mac or in a VM than use gcore to dump the core of chrome. After that you could do anything to find they keys, but I could write you a python app that recovers they key for you from the dump. I think you should do a practice run first on another Mac though. I seriously think I can get your coins back if you PM me so please do. Also, I'm sorry this happened to you man that really stinks :(
@_date: 2015-09-09 21:47:17
I'm just saying that I wanted to have e-coins.io available in my area. I am jealous of the people who had it available. I was just playfully assuming that you also where jealous of the e-coins.io people. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:32:57
So your problem isnt with the ssl then, its just with the actual code that you dont like. Alternatively you might just be saying that all implementations of javascript are inherently flawed so you cant use it with bitcoin. This is some grade A fucking bullshit here. 


Yeah crypto is hard. Not in the sense that your whole house will burn down though. You are saying that this whole website is fucked up. The crypto is broken. The javascripts are hacked. Your IP is fuzzed. Whatever you want to say. According to you if one this is fucked up the whole operation is fucked up. I used this too to generate a double spend. I did it online without SSL and without auditing to code and basically without any protection. Where have my funds gone? Nowhere. Thats weird. Well, maybe they will come back and steal my funds later. Yeah wait no thats not possible. I watched the network traffic. My private key wasnt anywhere in there. I dont know thats kinda strange considering how the whole website is fucked and all. 
You're just shilling. 
Fuck you. 
Crypto is hard, one mistake can seriously ruin your day. That being said If you use this website as it was intended to be used, you will be absolutely fine.

Everyone should also check [shipito]( if you are in the US and dont mind the [card limits]( Shipito accepts BTC too ;)

probably true.

@_date: 2015-09-07 15:45:26
Its javascript, all the code is run in your browser. The only data transmitted is a signed tx, which cant be leveraged to spend funds.

Ever heard of Rearden Steel?
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:07:16
I think this is probably the best option. [You can find some resources on how to do this here]( If you manage to get an image of your ram than you can search through the dump for something resembling a bitcoin private key. I can help if you like, just PM me.
This really sucks dude I hope you manage to get your funds back.
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:01:53
Yeah my bad. I meant to post just this post but I posted both. Both are filled with emotion and pride but lesser-so this one.
You're still not talking about the ssl. You claim that a flawed PRNG can enable an attacker to get your private key based on how you signed the tx. I think thats what you meant anyway, thats how I interpreted it. I am by no means an expert so pardon me. Anyway so with the signed tx you can get the private key. It that true, yeah, I guess it is. I haven't researched it but I will take your word for it. HOLY SHIT MAN WE NEED TO TAKE COVER. EVERYTHING IS HACKABLE. /dev/urandom is a prng, firefox's implementation of javascript uses urandom, it doesn't really matter. You are saying that just because the flaws haven't been uncovered yet doesn't make them disappear. That is true. That does not entitle you to make the argument that the flaws are there even when they havent been discovered yet however. If a flaw arises than yes, some hacker will make millions on reversing the signatures on the blockchain and getting the private keys because urandom is used to generate many many of those keys. You're not going to avoid this by not using a javascript application.
I think my logic is sound here but Ill leave it up to you.
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:43:57
Yeah sure, if you inject it. When you click save page as and then run it with firefox, there is a 0% chance that a remote attacker can spend your private key.

This doesnt seem too bad because it is only accessible from the local area network. That being said, remote code execution and bitcoins should never be in the same sentence.
