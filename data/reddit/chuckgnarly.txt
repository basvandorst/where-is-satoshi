I don't think I've ever seen something that embodies the word 'smarmy' so effectively as this pitch, it's really quite disturbing.

I also use a CIBC Visa Debit card, but for some reason I can't seem to add my routing number. It's not my first time adding that info, and I've looked up the transit and branch number formula to get the routing number, but the field is saying it's not a valid entry - what did you use? :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:52:35
I can't believe how easy that was... And the fees aren't bad at all, at least from what I can tell. As it's a Visa Debit, it just took directly out of my bank account - so there shouldn't be any Visa processing fees, right? Just the exchange rate?

That classy comment deserves a... fistbump. @_date: 2014-12-30 10:08:57
I couldn't agree with you more. It's no wonder you're the top-voted comment, and I hope you're as liberal with your re-tips as I am considering your well-formed argument. $2 @_date: 2014-12-17 04:53:14

Nevermind, derp - added it as a credit card, not as a bank account. :)

QuadrigaCX.com has worked great for me. I used to use cavirtex.com and VaultofSatoshi but they went under (though cavirtex is back in a different form), and Quadriga has been great since. It takes a few days to get verified, but they support Interac Online which BMO also supports, so I think they'd be your best bet. I bank with CIBC and haven't been shut down yet, and it's been over a year of regular BTC purchases...
You're not doing anything illegal by purchasing BTC, so fight for your right and just do it - if they close you out, kick up a stink and move your money somewhere else. They won't know to get on board otherwise.

I buy instantly in Canada with Circle. I know they say they don't take Canadian cards when you log in, but I entered mine anyway (MBNA Mastercard and CIBC VISA Debit) and both work. The exchange rate to USD is a little high, but I get the BTC instantly and never had to give any personal info to Circle.
Not sure if this works for every Canadian card, or I just got lucky, but try it out at least. :)

Further to this, if you have a Canadian debit card with VISA on it (still debit, just can be used on the VISA network), you can use that too and it'll pull directly from your bank account instead of your credit. I use CIBC and have this on my debit, and my MBNA credit card works too and doesn't treat it as a cash advance. 
The fees end up being higher with Circle than our CAD exchanges, but it's instant and you don't have to go through a verification process.

On second thought, they're actually graphically brilliant. It just may take a few minutes to get used to this type of presentation via YouTube. The teacher/student POV is a cliche for a reason I suppose, and his edits in real time are pretty slick. His other videos are just as good.

I appreciate the reply. Not exactly what I wanted to be comforted by as quadruple digits are far beyond what I'd ever be able to afford, but it was a great answer to a lame hypothetical! :)
@_date: 2015-01-25 10:25:02
I can't even imagine watching it climb after that and watching what you could have had. I know it's happened to so many people in the past on various investments, but that's got to be one of the worst feelings in the world with no one else to blame...

Yeah, you're mostly right of course but then there's the massive amounts of old money retirees that dominate the market in Victoria as it's basically the Florida of Canada - and for a single income family, 80k is barely livable if you desire a halfway decent home for your family and the luxury of a car. Also, living on an island jacks up the price of pretty much everything due to transportation costs.

She's ploying for tips, her comment history shows she can write can just fine. Some of the weakest baiting I've seen yet.

Thanks for answering and I agree, it's a weird question made weirder by my poor phrasing. I guess I'm just looking for the point at which the difference between what I've bought and what I could buy would have a negligible impact if we landed on "the moon", at least for a lower-middle class income. It's hard to articulate, but I'm sure it's a common feeling, but perhaps not. Basically just wanting to take the temperature of what a similar person of economic standing is shooting for I suppose.

Victoria, BC Canada - 2nd highest cost of living in all of Canada, right behind Vancouver. Vancouver is the 2nd highest cost of living *in the world*, after Hong Kong. 80k/year for a household income here is barely scraping by. Average cost of a house is around $600k, and a month of groceries for a family of 4 is easily over 1k. It's pretty though, so it has that going for it...

Apologies if you've seen this, but this guy is really good. Don't dismiss the format before watching a few of his videos, as they're super effective but perhaps a little graphically amateur. I've come to love them all though. :)
I think this might have what you're looking for:

Can the fallout from this lead to any possible insecurities in my existing Trezor and access to the private keys held within?
Honestly that's all I really care about. Sure it sucks they made a bad call under the pressure of a dirty knock-off, but I've already bought one and have felt secure with it until now... could this change that?

While I appreciate what you're saying, and it's absolutely usually true, my wife and I can't think of another house we'd rather raise our 3 kids in (out of any we've ever set foot in) than the one we bought 8 months ago. And we snagged it the day it came on the market, clearing subjects by noon and a mere 3 hours ahead of someone with a far better offer. Talk about a come-up!
My point being, sometimes the one you find that actually is perfect, has a super narrow window to become the house you and your family's entire life's memories are anchored in... I went overboard, am obviously blinded by love, and probably shouldn't have responded, but maybe it really is perfect for them? :)

I do not think you know with what you agree, good sir.

This little bitty went to market. Because this little bitty stayed home. This little bitty had relief. Because this little bitty...bank run?

That's the intent of the image, to allow for interpretation - TOOL is known to openly mock their fans. I kind of like this ambiguity specifically for a TREZOR as well as the representation of my favorite band - for if Bitcoin succeeds the device is a great tool, but if it fails then it's applicable to fool. :)
