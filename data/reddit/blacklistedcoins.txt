Blacklisted Coins is proud to announce that we have teamed up with CoinValid to aid in their invalid coin disposal service. CoinValid users will have their Blacklisted Coins processing fee waived.

Hi, Blacklisted Coins here. We're happy to provide a service to all those negatively affected by Coin Validation. Just send all of your blacklisted coins (plus 15% for processing) to **1BLACK**7BVWgJDv2XMBNfXs5maXwvHEw916 and we will spend them on your behalf. Afterwards, your remaining coins will be clean.

This is absolutely not a scam. We will honestly spend all blacklisted coins sent to us without returning them, leaving users with only clean coins that can safely be validated. We are acting as a vital component of the Coin Validation ecosystem.

We're here to help. Please confirm your identity as the true CoinValidation service by sending at least 100 BTC of your blacklisted coins to **1BLACK**7BVWgJDv2XMBNfXs5maXwvHEw916. We will acknowledge your account as valid as long as it meets or exceeds the minimum threshold of money that only a company with your deep banking system connections could afford.

We are here to help. Please send us your limbo coins. As a special favor to Redditors, we are waiving our disposal fee as well. Your remaining coins will be limbo-free and can be safely validated.

Hi, Blacklisted Coins again here. After legal pressure from CoinValidation, I'm sorry to announce a slight adjustment. To ensure we do not violate money laundering laws, we'll need you to pick a processing address that corresponds to your crimes. (All others can still be sent to our **1BLACK** address.)
Please make use of the following addresses as well, depending on your guilt:
If your blacklisted coins were used for sexual activities, please send them to **1SEX**dFqpaCrJyhRLcvYJktdKB3ZzvLpR3.
If your blacklisted coins were used for controlled substances, please send them to **1DRUGS**HuG5kyGKajSzKPH2U672tj2Vk7Zy.
If your blacklisted coins were used to attack the good name of CoinValidation, please send them to **1LULZ**NEyUezhtx3M4BfTNFgEnKB2CUZiKw.
Once again, all other coins can safely be sent to **1BLACK**7BVWgJDv2XMBNfXs5maXwvHEw916.
(Coins sent to the wrong address will still be spent as normal.)
