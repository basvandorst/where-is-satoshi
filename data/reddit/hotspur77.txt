I use blockchain, if I have a paper wallet and import those funds via the app am I ever in danger of overwriting my other wallet? I am always concerned having more than one address with any wallet type e.g. qt, mtgox. Etc. Do I have reason to fear?

Thanks for the response.  I work with a few silver bugs who keep telling me to exit Bitcoin.   It keeps surprising me how robust Bitcoin and the free market is. 
My thoughts on the etf.  If the etf had significant naked sorts the price would be much lower than other exchanges and raise concerns.  Still gives me concerns about off blockchain transactions.  I have heard people say many people in the future
 will use Bitcoin and no it realize it. I assume most of that is off blockchain transactions.

1. Gavin Andresen is the chief scientist of the blockchain foundation.  What oversight is there with his work or his ability to alter bitcoin?  I know he has cleaned up the code and its open source but what gives him permission to change the code?  I thought everyone loved bitcion because the "algorithm" can't be changed.
2.  Naked short selling on the comex is well documented.  Why is everyone excited for Bitcoin to be listed as an ETF.  Would this not allow banks to naked short sell Bitcoins?  All they would do is issue paper IOU for bitcions.  I thought all transactions need to take place on the blockchain or else there is opportunity for fraud. Seems way to easy for banks to naked short sell bitcions.  
3.  How big of treat to the overall health of bitcoin is the few major holders of bitcoin?  If bitcoin represented a treat to the banks the federal reserve could contact one of these early adopters and offer them basically any asking price to get a major holding in bitcion then sell them off on the markets. Thus crashing the price.  They don't loose anything because the printed the USD to buy the bitcoin and crushed the price and image of bitcoin.  Similar concerns if any early adopter wanted to cash out all his coins regardless to how logical it would be to sell them all at once.

I think it's valid concern, they have gone to great lengths to defend the petrol dollar. look at Suddam, and Gaddafi. they could easily make exchanges in USA illegal.

I agree paper bitcoins leads naked short selling. Etf are not needed nore do really benefit ecosystem People want bitcoin they should buy them and take ownership.

What governing does that audit?

What prevents them from selling more shares than the actual number of bitcoins they hold?   
How do we prevent GBTC from determing the price on actual exchanges? Assuming they short sell etc. 
ETFs seem like a great way to sell something they don't have?  A Bitcoin user like us knows you need to hold keys.  But the average person maybe content holding an iou for bitcoins that the ETF
never has to buy.

I think Bitcoin is less likely to be short sold than silver because it's so much easier to audit.  Would agree?
