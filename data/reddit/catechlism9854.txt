They more than likely were trading with intent to profit. I would have done the exact same thing if I had the capital to spare. 
For example, at one point I noticed that Coinbase was selling Bitcoin for ~$35 less than Gox was buying. If I had enough money and the proper verification with Coinbase, I could buy-low sell-high every single day of the week with damn good margins. Part of me is thankful that I didn't because of the problems with Gox currently, but part of me is sad because I could've made a killing from the time I noticed it until the time Gox froze withdrawels.

Honestly, you should never keep your coins in an exchange. The whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anyone with your money. The only thing I use an exchange for is purchasing Bitcoin. 
The exchange is the only party that has reason to keep coins in it. This allows for buyers to purchase them in a timely manner and not have to wait for coins to go:

Here's how I understand  it to work, if someone else knows more/better, feel free to chime in. 
Example: 




Now the US must either defend their acquisition of exhibit A in open court, or attorneys on both sides will discuss the evidence in private with the judge because the method is a secret guarded by national security. Either way, the US must show that the information was obtained legally or at least provide a plausible method of acquisition. This means that they can lie their asses off if there is a hypothetical way to legally obtain the information. I doubt the judge is going to ask for the data logs of every Joint Operations member who assisted in the acquisition. That would be time consuming and frankly useless because I doubt the judge would have a fucking clue on the implications of the logs.

I highly doubt that's the case. (A) The most common encryption algorithm was developed by the NSA. If anyone has broken it, it was probably them and they would more than likely keep it to themselves. Also I think it's safe to assume if AES were cracked and exploited by the NSA, Edward Snowden would have mentioned something about it. As far as I'm aware Snowden still trusts the common encryption methods which while it doesn't guarantee that they are safe it does add some reassurance. (B) If an outside company had broken common encryption methods the NSA would've swooped and forced them to remain silent because of how much encryption is relied upon in the corporate and national security spheres. If encryption is broken it is a highly guarded secret known by as few people as is required.

I agree that TrueCrypt and Tor being compromised is reason to be cautious and unfortunate for the crypto community as well as others. However I was under the impression that in the case of [TrueCrypt]( it was never made available *why* it was insecure. Also at the time of announcement, TrueCrypt told their website viewers to switch to "*Microsoft Bitlocker*." Now I'm not one to usually shout but that seems extremely...odd...to say the least. 
In the case of [Tor]( , according to Tor's statement, the only thing that's truly compromised are bridges. The only other thing that they mention is that it is logged when somebody accesses or searches for Tor or Tails. They don't mention anything about the encryption itself being flawed. 
As far as Snowden goes, I understand being skeptical but I see no convincing evidence to suggest anything other than he is genuine. Doesn't mean it's true, just that I follow evidence not speculation. It is possible that there are select few that are aware of an encryption flaw. However if that is the case, I believe they would try as hard as possible to keep it that way, which would lead to not wanting to expose the flaws meaning they wouldn't want to admit it in court. Therefore you have the protection of bigger things at stake if the method was revealed. But if it was common knowledge or even information protected up to a certain extent, it's highly plausible Snowden had access to it. And while he may not have grabbed everything, he sure grabbed a hell of a lot. 
And if there's one thing I wholeheartedly agree with it's the statement "There's no such thing as safe." Any other mindset breads complacency and opens one up to make stupid mistakes. Mistakes that Mr. Ulbricht could have surely avoided. 
Edit: added source links for TrueCrypt and Tor claims

Maybe instead of just saying, "you're wrong," and talking down to people you could contribute to the conversation and knowledge of the community as a whole and elaborate on why this is not how the law works.

@_date: 2014-08-05 21:10:59
Yes that is a huge factor in any method of security. The more trust is required the less secure it is, simply because you're adding huge variables that are essentially out of your control. It changes from security to gambling really. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:11:41
The only shitty thing was that all sellers expected 5/5 feedback, so you had to rely on review threads to really figure out who was good.

This is why encryption is so beautiful. Not because all of your data is "safe," but because in the event that the government has broken encryption methods they'd essentially have to admit it to use the evidence. And if that happens you're going to piss off every company on earth, including the ones funding the politicians. It's more of a catch 22 than real security.

The only thing the mixing service knows is your deposit address/amount and your withdrawal addresses/amounts. At the very most whoever they unmask you to knows your original address. It's not like they have more information than had you not used a tumbler, and there's a chance that it further obscures your transactions.

I assume they wanted to show that the bitcoin on his laptop doesn't indicate that he's DPR in any way. Yes there's tons of evidence that *does* indicate that, but the presence of SR coins is not.
