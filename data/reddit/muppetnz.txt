There will be another dip. There was one a couple days ago. Why is it rising so swiftly? People are starting to stand up and take more notice, media outlets are reporting more and more about it (albeit the general theme seems to still be "bubble"), and people love the idea of easy money. My advice still stands. If you are comfortable writing off that 7000TL that it's worth today then stay in; it will likely go up (although I'm less sure on BCH than I am on BTC), but if paying off debt now means you and she can have a better life then do that instead. Managed debt is fine, but no debt is better ;)
EDIT: I'm also not a financial adviser so take my advice with a grain of salt. Your mileage may vary

No one can predict the market. Tomorrow both BTC and BCH could bottom out and a new BitTrump coin could be our new saviour...who knows.
If you're not prepared to lose the amount of skin in the game that you've already put in then you should put a band-aid on and pull it out. If your family debt keeps you up at night and what you already have in BCH can solve that (or at least help you sleep) then you need to prioritise that and come back in later when you can better afford to.

That's awesome. Just make sure you do your research. There is so much misinformation out there. Also make sure you understand the differences of BTC and BCH. Both are very different coins with very passionate communities each with their own merits (and agenda's).
