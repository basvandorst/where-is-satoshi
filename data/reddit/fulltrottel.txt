Thank you. You made a good point. I read through your other comments here on bitcoin and wonder why you not already banned :) because voices of common sences and not of greade are rare to find in crypto traiding because everyone hopping for the moon and doubling money every day.
So what I'm reading in many of your posts is that bitcoin has no use in RL wich is actualy absolutly true. And it is a bubble because of this. 
But what is if it has a daily use as a currency? Maybe not bitcoin, maybe another coin. Because nobody use a currency wich cost 20$ per transaction. Doesen't give the daily use a value to that coin and then there will be no bubble? There would be economical grows with substance?

Full nodes doesn't play a role at Btc ether since most low RAM nodes can't handle the mempool anymore.

Well.. There are over 1300 altcoins out there and instead oft wasting power to then you should focus on lowering fees and raise adoption. Improve bitcoin and yourself.

What? No censoring after an hour? He is promoting altcoin for cheaper and faster transactions then biitcoin!

Is that good or bad in your oppinion?

Wether you like it or not. There is no such thing as digital gold. Your visa card don't become visa gold only because fees rise so high you can't spent it anymore. Your Dollar at Your bankaccount don't become golddollar just because wireing them would need a fee you can't afford. Also the same with amazon giftcard or PayPal.  The only thing wich gives bitcoin value is the use as a currency and bitcoin has to be very, very carefully not to lose this status. I'm still hodl but friends started to sell to catch some wins.

The answer was simple but is he right?

Wrong subreddit. You will get banned within 30 minutes for asking the wrong question and then you have your answer.

This is dumb. Instead of improving you blame other. Improve Bitcoin. Bring them to use. Buy a coffee with $1 fee? Ask them to accept lightning. I don't see the symbol. Ask them wich coin is the most used. If Bitcoin is the best the Rest will die anyway. But that don't happen just by beeing toxid on Reddit.

Not if you use an darker stone or moisten it. The engraving is only at the surface. But not washable or to scrape off so more a solution for a cold wallet. It´s more like a test because finally I want it engraved on metal. But pretty amazing anyway.
