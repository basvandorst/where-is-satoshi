No it isn't. A network with a stable number of nodes is 100% functional.


number of users.
You can't compare variables that have different units.


Not because of technical problems...wonder why we need the fibre network then even at 1mb..


So we increase miner profits while users have to pay for the higher costs of running a full node...Sounds reasonable.


But, you said you didn't know how secure it is in the sentence prior...and how do you know what 'secure enough' means? Secure enough for what even? I don't see any reasoning or even a method of measuring security here. This is pure hand waving.


how? which issue? scarcity of what?


Why do people use it? Because of its utility.


needs a source, don't use other people's work without citing them.


you can't apply boolean operands to real valued variables.


If this is linear, a factor of 100 leads to a factor of 100. Why would inflation come into this?
Also the ability to use bitcoin is much more limited by the low number of accepting merchants and the inconvenience of buying it than by the block size.


I don't see the problem businesses can price those costs into their service, users cannot.


No it doesn't. SW does that to enable second layer scaling solutions.


You're not making sense here. There isn't more money. There are more possible uses for bitcoin, its utility increases.


The utility of bitcoin was limited way more before SW and contrary to your BS, second layer solutions enable bitcoin to scale to billions of people.


less able to be widely adopted.
No one can verify where your cash came from, and nevertheless it is widely adopted.


only if you cannot easily switch from one to another.

The problem is: the problem doesn't go away with larger blocks.
If you increased the blocksize to allow for coffee purchases, people will buy more coffee with bitcoin. You'd have more transactions, your blocks would be full again. What do you do now? Increase the blocksize again? Goto Start.
Don't believe me? Imagine bitcoin had a 10kb max blocksize in the past and we would have doubled it each time it was full. The number of transactions is still growing. It would be growing faster if they were cheaper.
There is infinite demand. It doesn't matter how big your block is, if the coin is attractive, the blocks will be full. If there is space, people will come up with use cases which fill that space.
The network grows exponentially (look at btc price on a logarithmic scale) while blocksize increases scale only linearly. You just can't keep up and all the while it gets harder to run a fully validating node.

The problem with your idea is that most investors probably don't have the technical ability to judge which of the forks has better features/code quality/security (read: they can't tell what implementation keeps their investment safe) and are therefore somewhat dependent on others that can understand the code and its implications better. The people with the best understanding are probably the developers.
So investors trust developers that have proven they can create good software.
And with all due respect, as an investor you are here because of the quality of ideas and their implementation by the developers. That should give you a clue as to why any perceived hierarchy is not the way you'd like it.
Still, you are correct in one thing. In the end, we - the users/investors - are in control of what software we run. You're free to shoot yourself in the face by running untested code from unproven developers.

There are transactions people create to transact and there are (possibly - I haven't checked) transactions people create to fill the mempool.
Those are also valid and the system is designed to cope with this phenomenon, but that doesn't mean one can't point to them and say: "Here is an actor that is gaming the system. Let's pay attention and see if we can learn something from it. Perhaps we see a flaw in the security mechanism, perhaps we can make the system more resilient against this kind of behaviour."

depends on your wallet


- you have time and want to save money
- you have no time and want to make sure your transaction gets into the next block
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:34:10


Those two are unbelievable attractive even in a scenario of zero transaction costs.


because it causes higher costs for people running fully validating nodes. That is bad for bitcoin.


More transactions means more profit. The fees will stay high as the bigger blocks will also be full. (Infinite demand)


It's the door to many nice things and actually meaningful scaling of bitcoin.


I think the motivation for this is varied. [Here]( is an overview of why people are for big block hard forks.


I think some people get desperate as their businesses depend on transactions taking place, some others thought this is an actual consensus and a third group just wants to create a lot of damage.


Everyone thinks their side will get the majority vote, some think it'll happen fast, others think it'll be a long and ugly fight.
I think we will learn a lot in the weeks up to the fork date, especially after segwit has activated. People might change their mind.


Yes, currently but they're mining very fast through that 2016 block window and after that the difficulty will increase again. Also makes you wonder what happens to the price of bch when all those miners sell all that block reward.


spot on. Perhaps another reason why some people didn't want segwit or to wrest control from the bitcoin core project?


The covert version, yes. The overt version is still possible afaik.


Indeed. There is a lot of information, but some interesting bits are missing.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:51:44
The closed door agreement, the circumvention of the development consensus process, missed opportunity to add all the other nice things waiting for a hard fork.
We could have done the size increase combined with these other features within the context of the normal development process with hopefully much less contention and more time to do it properly.
This will probably still happen but we split the community again in the meantime :/

I think you underestimate the power of human rights here.
Without laws that guarantee personal property, nobody would have been incentivized to develop or run all the technology that bitcoin relies on.
Without laws that guarantee personal safety, scientists and engineers wouldn't exist and bitcoin wouldn't have been created in the first place.
You don't have the time to think about complicated scientific or engineering problems while searching for a bigger stick or a deeper hole and generally trying to survive in an environment that's out to get you.
Sure, even if laws exist people can still break them. But if they are enforced one way or another, few people do, otherwise they'd be ineffective and we wouldn't spend so much time and energy in creating them.

It comes from the people buying bch, obviously.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:32:23

@_date: 2017-08-18 11:40:20
You can try, but I suspect we won't find all of them. Humans tend to be very inventive if properly incentivized.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:55:15


What are you talking about? The NYA has been criticized from the moment it became public.


Firatly: it wasn't. Secondly: because 'the community' (bitcoin users) wanted segwit so why should they have fought it? Seems counterproductive.


True, but thats not the case as is apparent from the ridiculous node count btc1 has. Now don't you come at me with sybil attack arguments, those only make numbers bigger, not smaller. 160 supporting nodes is a joke.


You're delusional if not lying.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:06:07
As I said, the size isn't important.
Core - or rather the community - will move to a bigger block size later when other scaling options with fewer drawbacks have been exhausted. But as increasing the block size requires a hard fork, a lot of other features that also require a hard fork and are on a waiting list for a hard fork will also come into play. Changes to bitcoin require a lot of code review and on-ramp time to make sure the whole network can transition and people aren't losing money. Especially if they need to be introduced via a hard fork. Thus hard forks should be rare and should be used for multiple features, not just one.
This needs proper planing, organisation and quality assurance. All that is lacking in segwit2x (or any of the other clones we have seen so far).
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:56:12


Everyone that values tested, high quality software.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:42:07
I'm not saying you're wrong. I just want to mention that while the network probably will grow stronger and survive these attacks, your own funds might not.
Bitcoin can shrug off a spam attack, but you'll have to pay higher fees.
Bitcoin can shrug off miners creating an alt and then switching to it to make a quick buck, but you'll have to wait longer for your transactions.
So while attacks on bitcoin are positive for the evolution of the network, they might not be positive for any given user...Still, complaining obviously doesn't change anything.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:21:43
You're right of course. It's getting late for me.
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:05:34

@_date: 2017-08-20 16:38:18
The 'should' is just totally misleading as no one can stop you from running whatever code you want anyway.
Also: bitcoin core is closest to 'the original btc' with regards to the development and QA process that produces the software, and that is ultimately what realizes bitcoin's potential and is responsible for its value.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:42:10
Segwit was ready, it didn't get activated. That's not on core, it's on the miners.
It's a reasonable idea to start with scaling options that don't increase hardware requirements before turning to block size increases once those run out. It's more efficient and costs less money.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:31:18
Actually, I do. I'm more concerned about the network stability under adversarial conditions, about the small time between deployment and activation and about future changes. Colour me cautious if you want.
I don't expect the core developers to join the 2x project for obvious reasons.
and then there are those other arguments..
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:19:37
I think you're confused.
Firstly, segwit support *is* in the core wallet software. It's just not in the GUI.
Secondly, I suspect you're mixing up core devs and misunderstanding statements. Can you link to any post of luke's that contains what you claim?
I know Greg [pointed out]( why there is no GUI for segwit transactions yet in bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:59:24

After a hard fork it's not the same coin anymore there are two...how hard is that to understand?

It's just not fixing the problem. Not even short term, you can see that when Segwit activates and the block size actually increases.
And yes, demand is infinite.
Are you streaming 4k yet? No? Only HD huh... 8k-16k might look a lot better on a 50" TV, and isn't 50" a little small for a home theatre? Why only 24Hz, isn't 140Hz a lot better for fast movements? And now 2x for 3D but what about VR? We already have applications that surpass available network bandwidth as well as graphics performance of todays hardware.
Also applies to source code. Try cloning a big open source git. That takes some time because someone thought 'why not keep the history of every change' an idea that would have been impossible to realize with the lower bandwidth we had a few years back.
Also applies to CPU power, I'd love to run google voice locally, on my phone - without sending every word to their servers. But I'd probably need a couple of servers to run it, and why stop at voice? Wouldn't real time visual object detection by nice?

Using code developed in this way, without QA, without testing, without discussion reaching a consensus is endangering everyone's coins.

I think you misunderstood him.
Anyway, the process I mean is this (according to my view as someone who wasn't involved in any of it. May more knowledgeable people correct where I'm wrong.):
New features of bitcoin are submitted via BIPs (bitcoin improvement proposals), they are discussed via the bitcoin dev mailing list, btw everyone can submit them and everyone can take part in the discussion. In the course of this, the BIP is updated and changed to reflect what was learned in the discussion. When a BIP has matured enough and has reached consensus among those discussing, people will start to implement it. The implementation is getting reviewed by other devs, changes to the implemention are suggested and at this point again anyone can take part in the discussions.
Finally a state is reached that seems workable to enough people at which point it will undergo testing. Flaws are found and corrected, again with discussions accompanying the change proposals and testing continues.
Those proposals come with a time plan for development, testing and distribution so that the best possible level of quality can be achieved. They're also only worked on in this matter if it is expected that they will be accepted by the community.
In the end each user can choose individually what software they want to run. With money involved people tend to stick to the software that is developed in a prudent fashion - if they can't make that judgement themselves, they tend to stick with what worked in the past.

also from the top of my head:
- behind closed doors agreement of actors without any technical expertise and without consulting technical experts
- 2x not adhering to the dev/QA process
- hardforking without replay protection
- hardforking in a ridiculously short time frame
- it's a contentious hardfork (have you seen the btc1 node count?)
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:22:18
Well, if you stop being a bitcoin developer, you're a bitcoin developer no longer. Being a bitcoin dev involves subscribing to the dev and QA process that makes bitcoin great. If you are frustrated that your ideas don't get the approval of your peers and instead of working on your ideas and arguments to convince them decide to go and do your own thing, that's your decision.
Abandoning that process has - as of yet - lead to lower quality software.

Sidechains don't exist yet so no one is making money of them yet. Also: All of us will profit from sidechains once they come into existence as they allow bitcoin to have a lot more use cases. No one is forced to use anyone's sidechain and everyone can create their own sidechain so I don't see how any given individual will automatically profit from that in the way you are implying.


This isn't about updating the network. It's about control over the network. That's why there is fighting.


Just because something is simple to implement doesn't mean the consequences of that implementation are wanted. Scaling should be done by making bitcoin more efficient **before** we throw more hardware - and additional money - at it. And again: this isn't about scaling, it's about control.

Neither, I'm not an economist. I'm just saying that bitcoin transactions are a multipurpose tool that is becoming more attractive to more people daily, at an exponential rate. If transactions could be gigabyte sized and still cheap, people would probably send movie files.

*sigh* another conspiracy nut.
A: the blockstream devs were bitcoin devs before blockstream existed and before they got funding by a whole group of entities one of which is AXA. big deal, same applies to the TOR project with respect to the US government. Do you claim that one is malicious too?
B: there are many, many people working on bitcoin that are not employed by blockstream. But I guess we can just disregard them if that fits better to your narrative.
C: when you have code, you don't need to know who wrote it or who funded the dev as the code itself tells you exactly what it is doing. The whole argument is therefore uterly moot.
D: your argument goes like this: 'they are funded by banks, hence what they do is malicious *lots of hand waving*' this doesn't convince anyone who didn't believe they were malicious from the get go. It's a useless argument.
'they did this or that which is malicious because of $actual_understandable_reasons therefore they are malicious.' works a lot better.

What 'conflict resolution strategy'? You didn't write that.


It doesn't. The brand of bitcoin is defined by its users via their chosen developers. Those developers can setup whatever structure they want. Github is not important. They could just do it somewhere else and it'd still be bitcoin if the users agree with it.


I'm familiar with the structure. The QA process is what guarantees the quality not the authority over the repositories. The quality is one of the major selling points that keeps users loyal to the core project. Not who has commit access.
Commit access isn't important because the committers are just in service of the other devs. If they don't behave as they are expected to behave they will be replaced, if they don't give up access to the repository, that will also be replaced. They hold no power in that regard.
edit: here is an analogy for you. You're in control over a little pier into the ocean at which boats can dock to supply the country with food. Are you now in control over the country's food supply? No. Because if you decide to close your pier to some or all people, it's trivial for anyone to build another pier next to yours at which boats can dock and continue to trade. The pier is not important and you're not in control.
Similarly, if the bitcoin developers decided to make you the only person with commit access to the bitcoin core repository on github, would you now be in control over bitcoin's development process? No, of course not.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:01:02


No, they don't. Everyone can just fork the project and take over those roles as has happened countless times by now. It's open source software, you - and anyone else - can add anything you want to it. Commit access restrictions don't prevent you from doing that. Commit access doesn't define who can contribute to bitcoin or what can be contributed to bitcoin in any way.


I think you meant to say _objective_. Of course it's not, people never are. But it comes damn close.


It's well documented.


irrelevant, bitcoin isn't a representative democracy.


Those are social questions, they aren't solved via technology. The project structure on github is not important here as it can trivially be (and has been) replaced by another one should anyone at all feel the need to do so.


The information is freely available, you just have to read it.
edit: hey you downvoting troll army! how about you google the BIP approvement process and check if your opinions actually match reality? Cause they don't. Deal with reality. If you want to criticise the bitcoin development process, start arguing against the criteria and the process that gets BIPs approved or rejected instead of who has access to the git repos because the access rights don't make a difference.

An unsuspecting buyer of the stolen car radio unlikely has the ability to prevent the bricking of his device. The thief of a mining operation will carefully monitor the network communication of the stolen tech to not land in jail. Hence the tech might work in the case of car radios, in the case of mining hardware it won't. To invest money in a feature like this which will later produce headlines like "mining operation stolen - Bitmain's anti theft measure defeated" is a bad idea, no wonder they dropped it.

I don't that's another one of your misconceptions. I tried to point out that even if there are ideas that a lot of people share, there are always dissenters and people still disagree on many different topics. You don't realize that about Japan even though it's obvious that you won't find corporate Japan in maid cafes and that a tea or sake producer has a vastly different set of priorities than a robotics engineer.
Since you apparently unable to comprehend that I tried to apply your reasoning 'some things are very common so everyone thinks the same about everything' to the US where it should be obvious to you that this logic is flawed.


This may be true for the country side, japanese cities are multicultural hubs nowadays and the Japanese themselves have created countless subcultures themselves. They are most definitely not all the same.


Have you considered where those disagreements come from? You're not born with an opinion or a value. You learn those from your group. What you also learn, is that dislike of other ways to live. _That's_ what causes unnecessary conflict. If people learned tolerance for their fellow citizens' way of life instead, there'd be no problem.


What are you smoking? Compromise is the absence of conflict. You disagree, you compromise, you agree on some middle ground. No disagreement, no conflict.
Here's some food for thought: The conflict you experience in the US does not come from people going to different churches or cooking different food or singing different songs. It comes from all those mechanisms that destroy the level playing field and lead to that very apparent income/education/security disparity.

No I don't. What I'm advocating is everyone getting the fuck along with those having different opinions regardless of whether there is a border between them or not.
I know that Europe evolved from a state where a nation and culture was just a few miles across. Those cultures still exist today in local dialect, local songs, local food. Being part of a country doesn't erase your cultural background. In fact laws don't even touch most of culture.
Culture doesn't much care for borders. US media, music, food and some of its values permeate Europe despite the fact they are separated by borders as well as an ocean.
When you cross a border in Europe the villages on both side have more in common with each other than with the country they belong to despite borders and differences in law.
What you perceive as multiculturalism, spreading from cities, isn't. Multiculturalism doesn't mean having just one culture, it means the existence of many distinct cultures in one place. Sure, they influence each other, but it's not a fight to the death, it's coevolution.
You're using the fruits of such an evolution, the English language, right now. Without the germanic roots or the heavy french influences it would be a lot less flexible and interesting today.
Humanity benefits greatly from places where different cultures meet like for example New Orleans. Those places have been cradles of art, music, craftsmanship and science throughout human history. They are the locations where humanity creates all its biggest treasures.
Without new influences, without inspiration culture and in consequence humanity is stale and boring.

Uhm no. As long as people follow the laws it's best to have a diverse as possible population. That maximizes the chance of not breeding a group of ignorant nationalist sheep that hate foreigners just because they don't know them.


Yes there is. Most people become citizens by chance regardless of how beneficial they are for society. Where does their right to be a citizen come from? By birth? What an arcane argument. Their genes must be incredibly special.
Most of the wealth of a country was created not by the current set of citizens, but by people that came earlier, often by force, often at the cost of other people. Do you really want to argue you are entitled to all those benefits because of all the slaughter, colonialism and slavery of the past and your descendence from the people that did those things? And deny it to someone else just because they had the misfortune to be born to other parents?

I didn't say that. It isn't an upgrade. It's a power struggle..Upgrades are usually done by (or in accordance with) the people who produce the software in the first place.

Uh-huh because we habitually rent lots of servers to run just one at a time. And because google cloud engine doesn't already guarantee 99.95% uptime. Obviously we need a whole cluster of servers to make that work. Nevermind the $clusterSize higher cost.


Yeah right.

Well, you might not be impressed by quantum computers, the scientific crypto community is taking them seriously.
What does it matter that they are theoretical now if politicians can take 40 year old medical records in 50 years to discredit their opponent?
New crypto can only help you to secure new data, it's a blockchain after all, an eternal public record. All the old data, encrypted with the old crypto, has been online for anyone to download for years by that point.
You're on the internet and perfectly capable of finding that information yourself if you chose to do so.

The US Americans are the US Americans. They have their american dream and their burgers and fries, they love their capitalism. From the mechanic to the wallstreet banker.
You're kidding yourself if you think even a family of two agrees on everything from politics over philosophy to women rights or just the names of their children. People's opinions differ.

nodes vote by relaying blocks and blocking peers. If you remove the mining nodes, it's trivial (and profitable) for any node owner to enable mining on their own node.

You just assumed that support, there is no indication that it actually exists. Those companies surely could have implement polls among their users if they were interested in representing them. They didn't.


No, they don't need to. They act in what they perceive as their self-interest. They might be wrong about what is best for them and what they do might not be best for you. They could, for example, create lots of bitcoin forks (not good for bitcoin) or mine bch whenever that is more profitable (not good for bitcoin) or they might fake trading volume and cause themselves to get shut down (not good for bitcoin).


No, they don't. They choose for themselves, I choose for myself. If I don't like their game, I'm not going to play with them.


No, it wasn't. In fact it's impossible to design it that way (and have it work) because everyone's motivations differ. That's why it was designed with game theoretical considerations that balance all those motivations. If you gift your own influence to other entities you get centralization and the fuck-up that is the current situation.


...yeah, right.

selling the hardware would make sense if you already ran the next, more efficient version internally.
that would give you a less-effective version of the asicboost effect: it keeps the competition at lower efficiency. as a bonus you can sell your old miners.
another situation where selling miners would make sense is when you're already at max capacity and are in no position to use all the miners you can produce. (this one might be more likely)
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:13:45
Not as such. There are people running UASF nodes so there is a network to relay the blocks. Since the UASF client also comes with some logic to prefer connections to other UASF clients their network should stay connected.

Who buys the coins if there are no user? So where does the value come from? Users clearly have influence since the price largely depends on demand and supply which is not surprisingly created by users.
Exchanges depend on users, miners depend on users and guess what developers depend on users as well.
In the long term, users are the only ones that hold any power here. They will just switch to some other coin if they don't like the current one anymore. Miners, devs and exchanges will follow.
The fitness function for blockchains depends on user acceptance alone because users are the source of money/importance.

It doesn't. A quick google search for bip148 will get you a the uasf website which links (scroll down) to binaries of a version of bitcoin core that supports bip148.

'git clone' copies those files to your computer, you know that because that's how all the other files came to your computer. You didn't have to copy anything from anywhere.

There are many possible ways to improve bitcoin to make it process more transactions, increasing the block size is the naive[1] choice.
I think we should implement every other, better solution to make bitcoin more efficient before we increase the block size as a last resort. Especially because scaling bitcoin is not a one time thing. We will be scaling bitcoin continuously over the next couple of decades. Starting with block size increases while there are other options is just plain stupid. It won't work over the long term because we can't double the block size on a regular basis at the end of Moore's law.
Second layer services alone can scale bitcoin to levels you could never achieve by plainly increasing the block size.
[1] that's a scientific term for an obvious solution that might come with disadvantages

No, you're supposed to run it instead of the original. (It is essentially the original client with a patch). You don't need to to uninstall the original, just don't run it.
You likely ran the make install command from the wrong folder.

My guess is they are insured against those losses which means in turn everyone pays a premium to mitigate that risk.
Those IRL time constraints effectively eradicate the trustless characteristic of the bitcoin network - one of its major selling points - by reintroducing counterparty risk unless you allow for second layer solutions that give you fast trustless transactions -&gt; LN.

My point is: they can't 'fire core' by running core code. It's not a new non-core dev team if in the end 99% of the work was done by core devs.
Either the whole thing is a charade or they are even more clueless than most people already think they are.

Correct, I didn't say you were to change folders, the original instructions I linked does though. (I'll edit the post for the benefit of posterity) The original instructions also say you should run ./autogen.sh and ./configure before running make.
I think at this point you're way past the nornal level of spoon feeding you could expect from the internet. 
Anyway, I'm glad you figured it out in the end. Have a nice day.

People didn't 'move to other coins' within two days. If people were moving to other coins that would have happened over at least a month (or more likely over several months, the fees were high for a long time after all).
It seems highly unlikely that this sudden drop is related to people using other coins.

your on-chain coffee will be cold by the time the first confirmation is in. medium sized transactions make this problem even more obvious:
let's say you buy a weeks worth of groceries. is the shop now supposed to wait half an hour for every customer or take their hundred dollar purchases on good faith (without confirmations)?
IRL everyday use needs second layer payments.

That wasn't my intention. there is no need to install, you can just go to the src folder and run bitcoind. But the link I posted also explains installation and running




you can run


from the src folder in order to check if you're running the UASF code. It will output "subversion": "/Satoshi:0.14.2/UASF-Segwit:0.3(BIP148)/", among other things

it's not the download that takes most of the time, it's the verification process.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:46:35
? Accepting payments without confirmations contains counterparty risk. You need the other party (the paying party) to actually pay and have the risk of them not honoring the contract (paying), thus counterparty risk.
Trustlessness means you don't have to trust any participant of the network, not even the sender of a transaction. The network guarantees that the transaction takes place, but this is only guaranteed through confirmations. Without them you cannot be sure that the transaction is really a part of the shared ledger. As long as you don't have the confirmations, you have to trust or wait.
Why do you think this doesn't make sense???
Let's make this perfectly clear: In our scenario you're not even waiting for the first block because - let's face it - 5min waiting is already too long. At this point I can run a fake wallet that just pretends to send out transactions.
