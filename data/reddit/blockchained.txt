@_date: 2012-09-16 21:02:13


Agreed. But perceived value will also help drive the value of the dollar down as bitcoin continues to grow.
As other assets continue to rise, the contrast between the dollar as a store of value compared to bitcoin, gold, etc. will become starker. Bitcoin is disruptive in that it's the first actual new store of value in centuries. The disruption will be enough to shock the system into  driving the value of the dollar down more than if bitcoin didn't exist. IOW, bitcoin's very existence will help to fuel the fall.
The other strength that bitcoin has going for it is in supply. Since  bitcoin neatly solves the problem of supply (it can't be expanded at whim), velocity and value can now reinforce each other rather than be subject to the vicissitudes of whomever controls supply. As Gresham's Law only applies to exchange rates set by law, this may be a case where good money will chase out the bad. Time will tell.

I think any paper-based investment (except for toilet paper...you sold me) is a bad one right now. People invested in paper are making themselves an easy mark in the case of what appears to be a massive deleveraging working itself down the chain. 
When the day of reckoning comes and a critical mass of people try to match liabilities to existing assets in the world and the light comes on that there aren't enough commodities to match promises, the ensuing scramble will cause a fall in paper and a rise in physical goods. 
So you're correct about TP as an, um, asset. But when the shit hits the fan, maybe we'll want to save the expensive TP and just use fiat instead.

Rather than make this about me, keep the topic on banking and history, k? I tend to take people more seriously if they can stay on topic.


The Federal Reserve is the government's stamp of approval on a private venture that robs every American that uses the currency. It's nothing new. The Bank of England began the fun in 1694. 
As [Frederick Soddy]( (1921 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) and [Norman Thompson]( (early aviation pioneer) stated in their [1941 letter regarding fractional reserve banking]( 


triﬂing portion, is originally created by the issue of a loan at interest by the 
"bankers", who lend nothing of themselves but in effect make a forced levy in 
kind on the Nation by conferring on the borrower the power to purchase a 
corresponding amount of wealth on the market, which wealth does not belong to 
them, or those who borrow from them, but to the community. The proceeds of the 
issue of new money - whether of paper or any other form of credit money - 
belong to the Nation in which it is, or is accepted as, legal tender, and not to the 
issuer. Herein lies the basic ﬂaw of the existing monetary system. 


preceding era of history, is the undermining of all lawfully constituted 
authority by the creation and destruction of money carried on in secret for 
private gain and the acquisition of power. 


socialist or communist, fall alike under the control of a political Power 
Group, which is ultimately, and in large measure unwittingly, dominated by 
the Money Creators and Manipulators. In this way the national political 
power, which, if the individual is to enjoy the maximum of personal freedom 
consistent with his duty to his conscience and his fellows, should be distributed 
throughout the people, has been usurped without their knowledge and consent.

We're approaching 10,000,000 btc that have been mined. That's a potential ~1 quadrillion keypairs. Should bitcoin break out in price, which it most likely will after the block reward halves, people will be creating more keypairs as a natural result.

Agreement. But that doesn't stop anyone from starting another full-reserve blockchain currency or a few of them based on any commodity.
Suppose you have 100 oz of gold on reserve, audited and bonded. You create a blockchain that contains 10,000 coins. Call them AuCoins. No mining for coins will be done as all the gold has already been "discovered", but miners are still needed for transactions and block creation.
Just for round numbers, let's say gold is at 2000/oz. With $200,000 in gold, you've created 10,000 $20 gold coins. They'll rise and fall with the price of gold, making a private floating currency that can be traded instantly just as bitcoins are.
Getting people to use the currency would be the hurdle. But the technology now exists for individuals and associations to create their own means of trade. 
I could even see a day when a client is developed that will peer on multiple coin networks. Bitcoin will always be the granddaddy, but this thing is just getting going.

Bitcoin is also a commodity. What gives it true value is instant transfer of ownership, like cash. 
I've put a sizable percentage a week into bitcoin and even with volatility, bitcoins are performing better than the dollar or even gold and silver.

Yet filesharing is bigger than ever.

The PGP key is his IQ test. : )

That depends on how driven by money one is, doesn't it?
Bitcoin has potential to disrupt the greed factor while still rewarding the profit motive.

Importing a private key into another wallet is another reason.

Just because a central governing authority claims regulatory power over every voluntary transaction doesn't make it so. Before the Reformation, bishops used to assume that everyone fell under the sway of the Church, too.

You make a good case. I'll research it further. I'm in the process of setting up Armory on an old laptop for a cold wallet. 
Thanks for the time you put into the reply.

Then you need to study the protocol more.

I agree with you. Bot shepherds are pure scum. But if you're holding what translates into actual cash on a Windows box, who do you blame when the wallet stealing Windows trojans really start ramping up?
An ounce of prevention and all that.

You can say that again.

There you have it. The brains behind the bitcoinica scam says he trusts the brains behind the GLBSE scam.

They'll drive the value of bitcoin waaay up, and after the selloff we'd all buy them back cheaply.
Sounds like a plan. I'm game.

You're the one that invoked how much money someone was making as some sort of meaningful metric.


Corzine is still a free man.
@_date: 2012-09-09 17:18:59
I think we're in agreement on that. 
@_date: 2012-09-14 02:53:28
I won't be using them anytime soon. 
Save up your btc and get one soon. The price is only going to rise. : (
@_date: 2012-09-18 18:09:40


Agreed. But if they can't apply the lessons of recent history to the context of bitcoin, it makes me wonder what other aspects of history they miss with their occluded sight.

I lost 43 btc for a year. I found them on an old USB drive this past July.

This should be at the top of the subreddit.

One of MS's lead networking geeks says that the URI is dangerous and unsafe. This is a step towards marginalization, not acceptance.

Bitcoin has also outperformed gold in the same period, though gold looks like it's ready for a breakout.

Windows has always had poor security. Remember WinNuke?
@_date: 2012-09-27 18:27:36
Not necessarily. I do it just to consolidate wallets. 
@_date: 2012-09-05 22:29:39


Bitcoin can't be "hacked". There's not enough energy in the universe to break SHA256. The servers on which bitcoin keys are sitting can be hacked, however. 
Bitcoin's address space is secure. The servers that people run aren't.

Short term thinking as a general strategy is never smart. Most cheap and greedy people are short termers.
@_date: 2012-09-18 15:24:56
I don't see much support for bitcoin from the zerohedge/Rockwell/Reason bunch. I do see a lot of ignoring if not outright dissing. 
That will change when their principles can be bought for bitcoin.

Jesushchrist, give it a rest.

That almost happened to me. I saw a shark once.
