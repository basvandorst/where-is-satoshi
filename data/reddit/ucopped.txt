See thats the issue,  I can't accept normal cash/card payments. This would definitely be a really good idea if I managed to do this. I like your thinking :) 
I'm looking for a payment processor but no look at the moment.

How are you currently marketing this?
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:43:44
I do have some customers in the US so I could do that. That sounds like a good idea.
Just for other customers in the UK and EU.

It's one of the only ones I can find that allow you to buy satoshis instantly without a long application. Thought this would be appealing to my customers to use. If you have any alternatives, let me know.

My website currently is using Gourl to handle bitcoin payments. The coins are forwarded to my wallet after payment.
I could set up btcpayserver but it doesn't seem worth it if no one uses it. I will have to pay and maintain the server with little to no return as my customers are reluctant to use bitcoin.
Btcpayserver is an option when I can get solid customer base who will pay with btc.

Hi Guys, hope someone can help. 
I'm looking to accept bitcoin through my site but want to make it easy for customers who don't have much knowledge about it. I have tried using coinbase commerce but the customer has to keep the terminal open until the payment is confirmed... not ideal. 
If customers use an exchange such as switchere and use the btc address on checkout, could this work? Seems to be okay as customers can buy BTC with fiat currency. Is there any other alternative methods? Just want it to be efficient as possible for the customer.

This is exactly what I needed to hear unfortunately haha. What is best method at the moment? Would the method I described make sense? Using the crypto exchange to directly send payment?

The best incentive I can offer is a free item or a significant discount. 
Do you know of any directories where you can advertise businesses accepting crypto payments?

I tried to use Coingate but the application was more stringent that normal processors! Killed the anonymity of bitcoin.

I think you've miss understood my point. I'm not too bothered about the exchange rate.
I want to accept bitcoin as it is currently the only method I can use to accept payments which is fine. I'm fine with the cryptocurrency termnology etc but my customers aren't to tech savvy or wont go through the hassle of trying to work it out. 
I'm asking for a way in which I can convince them to use the currency. However, they need to buy it in the first place which means either sign up for coinbase etc (long process) or use a bitcoin exchange such as the ones I stated stated where they can buy the coins easily with their debit/credit card.
Then they have to send the coins to me to purchase the items. They can send using their wallet if they went through the trouble of signing up to coinbase etc. 
If they didn't, they can use an exchange to purchase the coins but instead of sending them to their wallet, they would send it straight to mine.

They've made the sign up process for merchants really complicated and long winded. Put me off from signing up. They ask for more information than standard credit card processors.

It's going to cost me like $20 for a month to run the server if its on vps. Don't think it's worth the cost currently.

I'm still in early stages of business yet funding it entirely myself. So any penny saved rn is a penny earned.

Just doesn't seem feasible right now. Once I get guarantee an influx of some converting traffic to the site, I can implement this.
The time and cost associated with setting this up is not a risk I am prepared to take just at this moment. Running a business is all about profitability.
