this (below) is the address my all bitcoin has been sent to: 
 3KEK5rd4LtqV6UXipkLjnvADvXXJDdqj3x 
it is easy to google this address and find how does the subsequent transition happened, and easy to chase where the bitcoin has gone, but I don't know how to get the coin back.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:09:19
I did not use passphrase 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:57:00

@_date: 2018-11-22 08:57:46

@_date: 2018-11-22 09:05:16
I own all inputs, yes, BTC came from different address.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:58:16

@_date: 2018-11-21 20:34:11
yes, it is handwriting on a paper.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:48:50
I have reported to Trezor via Twitter, it reply to me would somebody contact me, but not yet. what can I do? 
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:16:28
but he just want to charge fees first, how can i trust him, even I promise him to pay him whole amount when my bitcoin half return. It is wired.

I bought trezor directly from Trezor one year ago, I have used and save my coin for a long while, there was no any problem, until 9th, September. The big issue happened

the recovery words is in my pocket, never been accessed by somebody else 
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:22:43

nobody shares my room, I don't know if the customs officers can see the 24 words through X rate scanner, but I am afraid it is possible. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:43:59
what a tragic story happened on me. how can i chase them back?
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:40:27
but there is no chance at all. 24 words is always with me without leaving.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:57:58
the last I bought bitcoin happened  on 19/08/18, from then on, I had not accessed to my Trezor wallet until this morning , what a horrible story, it happened to me, I trust trezor so much, almost every one said trezor was safe, but it happened 
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:10:09
no, I have not
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:50:32
no, I bought from Trzor, it is brand new
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:21:24
any experts help me to chase, these are all my wealth, 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:02:47
i carry it wherever I go, except I sleep.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:02:19
no, i have not used 
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:42:43
hi, did you contact to Binance? what is its response?
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:00:36
I have not used pass phrase at all, the recovery seeds I always keep very safe , nobody touch it 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:03:57
what is that means? is it more possible to get it back by using segwit?
