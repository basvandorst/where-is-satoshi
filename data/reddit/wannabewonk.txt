Nothing magic about taxes.

Hydroelectricity and cryptocurrency are a match made in heaven. Dams produce so much electricity at essentially a constant rate all day every day. Mining is such a cool way to store that value instead of letting it go to waste.
HydroQuebec was recruiting miners to move to the region. Cold weather, cheap land, cheap electricity. Bitcoin travels long distances a lot better than electricity.

I'm not advocating for or against UBI here, I'm just saying even Yang isn't trying to propose a system that doesn't at least theoretically work. It's not magic, I can tell you where the money would come from; whether or not you want to take the money from that place is another question. Yes, some people will have to pay more in taxes! 
The negative income tax (essentially basic income) was proposed by _Milton Friedman_, one of the most famous libertarian market capitalist.

1000 is actually a pretty typical statistically significant same size if you're properly randomly sampling your population of interest. The question design is definitely not great, though.

Right, he says that as if the stock market doesn't move together largely in the same way many cryptos do. Having 100 different stocks reduces your risk of any single one tanking (like might happen with any single crypto), but they're all going to move together for most of the time.

National debt is absolutely noting like credit card debt. First of all, the American government itself owns most of its own debt. Secondly, American _citizens_ own a significant portion of debt because they've given loans to their government because they _know_ our economy will almost assuredly keep growing. As for the foreign debt, we own something like 90% of what _we_ owe in _other_ country's debt.
Not even business debt is like government debt. You know why Amazon pays so little taxes? Because they keep spending and borrowing more than they make. Because they know they will grow.

Is there a list of exchange wallet addresses? It seems both easy and impossible to track what wallets are being used by exchanges. On one hand, they hold a ton of coins. On the other hand, they're not really publicized, right? You'd manually have to manually look through the blockchain.

I bet less than 10% of all coins held on exchanges will be withdrawn. Is there any way we can really gauge participation?

The free market means you can give your business to somebody else. If crypto enthusiasts are really as bothered by this, they should vote with their wallets. I think that's a fine way of dealing with the situation.

What if I like Bitcoin but I hate fascist morons?
@_date: 2019-05-05 14:25:44
If I sell tiki torches, and fascist morons start using them for stupid shit, I have every **right** to refuse their business.
