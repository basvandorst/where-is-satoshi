The issue I have with this article (puff piece), is they are claiming that:


This isn't exactly true, while transactions fees are small, in most countries you still have taxation. My point is: moving wealth is rarely, if ever free. 
And while using bitcoins itself is a direct transfer, Coinkite is an intermediary, is like a bank then. My point is: there is plenty of escrow &amp; risk in bitcoin, which is glossed over.


Okay, this is plain bullshit. I'm tired of it. Bitcoins are not instantaneous, confirmations take time, this is another bit of misinformation advocates are spouting. 
Lastly, I asked Anthony di Iorio about security after visiting, and apparently he's a talking kind of a guy rather then a typing kind of guy [on reddit]( The in me is caution, as much as curious.
My final point is this: While bitcoins and inherently different then current forms of currency, it invariable falls to the same pitfalls as regular currencies. We should stop selling/marketing incorrectly and call the spade, a spade, so to speak.
All in all, just my two cents.

Can multiple pools collude for a 51%? 
If so, isn't any moderately size pool a danger?
Pools seem to only weaken the decentralization of Bitcoin. 
I just feel like there's a panic going on right now, for something that's been a constant threat. Perhaps, until bitcoin get some type of proof-of-stake, pools should be boycotted.

I imagine putting a system like that in place would allow for bias things to happen. Meaning, I could flag your coins as non-legit, and negatively effect things, even if, say they were legit. Sure, it could help prevent the use of stolen coins, but it's something that would be double-edged. This is something that regulation needs to fix, governments need to hold liquidation points accountable. But you'll always have bad players, think, off-shore banking, someone would still want the dirty money.

I'm pretty sure there are Text-To-Speech tools for reading GUIs. OSX has this built in as "VoiceOver". I'm not sure if it's compatible with QT, or if there's an alternative for windows.

Just curious, but why bother with phone verifications? I mean, anyone can pickup a pay-as-you-go for under $40 from 7/11. It doesn't seem to verify anything.
Fingerprint is useless, and an ID scanner isn't any better, both can be faked. An ID scanner would be useful if you can actively verify the ID, but alas I know of no APIs to do such.
Also the physical location didn't look secure, plenty of windows didn't have bars up, I didn't notice any cameras, aren't you worried about thief or man-in-the-middle attacks. 
I went to the launch party and failed to see the business as secure as a bank. Isn't that what we expect?
Aren't you worried about laundered money? I mean, the bar is pretty low for verifications.
I think you need to do a 'Know your Customer' just like cavirtex or bust. Just my two cents.

No, you just have no fucking clue what I'm talk about.
I understand what Bitcoin QT does. I'm merely mentioning that this isn't a problem for native applications on OSX. Windows, alternatively has Narrator built in to do the same. 
I'm claiming specifically that: I'm unsure if either works with QT, which if they do, would be a perfect solution.
PS: Rather then telling someone what they're saying, you should confirm if you understand them correctly. This is best done as a question.

I wish it was, but a long as gateways can obscure the blockchain, it loses all transparency. Ergo, bitcoin has only solved half of it's problem, namely disturbed trust, it still has no method for solving what happens behind closed doors. If bitcoin could solve both, it would be something to praise, right now it's an endpoint for value exchange. That really isn't a second coming of the internet, not even a second coming of digital currencies. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin isn't truth, it's the idea of truth.

No it's not rude; it's helping out with minor oversight.
Code &amp; docs aren't an online forum, there repositories of information. Information should always be in a sane format. I think it's professionalism.

They're pushing harder on revenue streams like redditgifts and ads. 
Bitcoin is also counter-intuitive to long term goals like [reddit notes](
Collect (help advertises, +money),  buy-give-keep (reddit store, exchanges - virality, +money).
Sure, it might be useful to have bitcoins as a payment method for reddit notes, but they want to push their own reward/monetary system. 
Bitcoins are supplementary, I'm not surprised by this, maybe they had plans for reddit notes to be a crypto currency, but I feel the execs would avoid that.

Not really, I mean, github has an online editor and can merge pull requests online. 
Two people using a couple pages on the internet for a couple seconds isn't a large cost...

I see no need to discuss this over the phone (but if you really want to hit me up with a PM, we can also just PM about it). And there not big concerns for me personally (I'll still use the machine), these are just my observations from visiting as a security conscious developer/individual. 
I'm hard pressed to see how communicating privately helps answering these. If I asked something too sensitive, just don't talk about it.
I also understand and respect what you've done for the community here in Toronto.
It's really just my two cents. I'm feel others might be as curious as me, perhaps not. And to reiterate I'm not trying to be critical.
Keep on rockin'

This is true, but you can always build a web-mobile app, like forecast.io that avoids all the tape apple puts up around the store.
