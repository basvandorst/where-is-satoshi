so i checked your post history u/ghee99  and found at that you are
-in bitcoin for the money
-very active on r/The_Donald
-climate change denier
-hardcore trump fan/liberal hater
your post history clearly suggests that you got in for the money, got frustrated when bitcoin lost value and now you are constantly making posts about how bitcoin sucks, thats what you get for investing in something you dont understand, you can fuck right off of this sub and the bitcoin community at your earliest convenience.

Well central bank does whatever erdogan tells them. Holding this workshop is the best way to acquire information about people holding a considerable amount of bitcoin without spending hundreds of thousands of liras to hire some people who know their way around the security protocols
