My dog, [ollie]( is a rescue. I'm trying to keep an open mind, instead of jacking off on my adopted-pet high horse and crucifying anyone who isn't up here with me.
Don't be a cunt. :)

Totally true! In my area, most of the shelters are filled with senile or sick doggoes. I found [ollie]( at a stroke of luck in one of 'em, but I am always cognizant that there are risks associated with adopting (just as there are risks when buying from a breeder).

you are **heavily** implying shame on op for not picking the abandoned pets. like it or not, some pets are abandoned for a reason - a lot of people don't like to gamble on their forever friends being batshit.

there is no source, as riot/blizzard/valve would never release demographic information like this. however, if youve played all three games, the median age(or at least the maturity) disparity between league and dota/starcraft is pretty obvious.

why are people arbitrarily throwing around that term recently? did you see it in an askreddit thread or something?
I've played and enjoyed all three games. It's pretty blatant that league players are less mature than SC2/dota players. There is no confirmation bias as I don't have any particular bias. adding two cool words that you saw on the internet to your post doesn't make you a psychologist.
