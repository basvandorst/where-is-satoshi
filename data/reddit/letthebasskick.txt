We should support The people who didn’t know their risk tolerance was shit today and going forward. Don’t be that guy to rub it in anyone’s face because he sure was stupid to invest more than he or she should have so let’s ask them how they are doing instead
On a positive note hopefully I’ll be seeing some GPUs on kijiji at a discount off msrp

I’m so pissed but happy that Kraken has yet to deposit my wire. I sent it on dec 11 and it takes 5-12 business days. I’m hoping to see it in there now or tomorrow to buy!!!

keep an open mind, its easier than keeping a wall up and only accepting certain things

I want to know as well! Really cool

Seriously check out quadriga and etransfer it. Took 1 day small fee by it was identical to the wire fee. 
Took 2 weeks for my wire to go in, and it cost me $30 cdn from the bank and seen another 45 off the top after it went in.

Watch it and shut up

Awesome. Thanks

Just got deposited!!! Boo yea

Can’t even do anything on their website holy shit it sucks

Wish I knew more about the best trading platforms to use or I wouldn’t have wired some money into my cdn account. 
I found etransfer the fastest method and using  the best. Took 1 day to get my money in there and I know there’s a 2% fee but I was very confident in their platform. 
Not impressed with kraken at all and the moment I place my trades I’m pulling out immediately into my hard wallet

I have read reviews, seems like sellers are getting the shit end of the stick getting scammed or administrator run around locking account/siding with buyers. I am not even doing a real deep search. Just type Localbitcoins reviews.

I used Shakepay, never thought it would be so easy with them. All in all took an hour free deposits and withdrawals and very nice app and website. Seriously the easiest and most pain free way to withdraw crypto to fiat to a Canadian bank using etransfer

Absolutely agree. I use a ledger nano to keep my coins safe. I’ve been in Btc since the $5k mark up to 25 and down to 3-4 and back lol I felt comfortable now with the price to sell some

I appreciate your replies. Ive sent Kraken a ticket request. There are a lot more US based options which is cool but doesn't help me.

Then what? loan going into default and hit credit report.
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:23:27
Cool, i like the plan but what platforms are you using.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:05:43
Got some feedback to use shakepay. free deposits and free withdrawals up to 5k.
Ill wait for my kraken ticket to finish up

I have a few hundred in Kraken, have tried maybe 10 times to EFT to my CAD account and no luck. I have triple checked everything and made sure its all correct. Every time it's getting returned.
It should be as easy to withdraw as it is to deposit. What im asking is what options have people used successfully to withdraw to CAD bank account. I have a lot of trust issues with BTC, I pulled all my BTC onto my Ledger nano S. Since then we have seen a few scandals when it comes to exchanges and i just want to get it right on the exit.
Also these scandals were exchanges I had accounts with. I  just don't want to lose money, hoping to see what others are doing.
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:07:49
yea! seems like a really good option. ill report back shortly. friend of mine just messaged me the same.
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:28:17
coinbase to paypal, I seen it pop up on my emails its an option. I'll check it out, 
canadianbitcoin has some pretty shit reviews and the sell is $14613.57/BTC while the exchanges are around 15,814.07. Maybe there is something im not seeing here?
