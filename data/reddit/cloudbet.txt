Hi folks,
Unfortunately, nobody made it past the group stages. We only had a small handful that picked Algeria, and an even smaller handful that picked Costa Rica. 96% of entrants selected Spain to go through.
Worry not - we have a bunch of exciting new promotions coming soon so keep your eyes peeled for announcements!

Hi there,
Firstly, I'm sorry that you had a negative experience with us. As another poster commented, regular time plus any time added for stoppages is the industry standard in football bets, and major fiat books all operate in the same way. We also offer "To qualify" markets where there is no draw option, where the winner is the team to qualify for the next round. It sounds like this is the bet type that you wanted.
Thanks for your feedback. We will be adding more clear explanations in the betting interface to help prevent this type of mistake in the future. We are going to add tooltips above each market name - does this sound like it would do the trick?
Please let us know if you have any questions or if you have any further suggestions.

Hi there,
The sportsbook rules are clearly stated if you follow the "Sportsbook rules" link in the footer on every page of our site.

It is not possible that you received a message saying 20 BTC was bet.
@_date: 2014-11-12 06:33:43
I agree, it does, but I can assure you it isn't!
@_date: 2015-05-05 03:44:05
Hi all,
In this case, OP mistakenly thought he had placed a bet when in fact he had not. OP's bet was not placed as betting was closed when he attempted to make the wager (while the dealer was shuffling). Consequently, no funds were ever deducted from their account and no bet was placed. It is not possible to bet while the dealer is shuffling.
In the live dealer casino, there is a specific time window during which a player can place a bet. We like to keep games moving quickly and there are often tens or hundreds of other players betting on the same hand.
At the end of each round, we always display a "Player wins" or "Banker wins" message, regardless of whether or not the player had a bet on. 
I understand the player is disappointed here but the bet was not ever placed. Similarly, had banker won (and player lost), no funds would have been deducted either.
I hope this clears things up. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if anyone has any questions or if there is anything we can do to help.

We don't have cats, and our Shih Tzu - Diego - is very lazy and spends most of his day licking himself.
In seriousness, we keep redundant copies of private keys at multiple secure geographically dispersed locations, and run an m-of-n split-key system with keys held by different Cloudbet officers.

In the video, a losing "wager" would not have been deducted from his account as no wager was accepted.

Hi all,
Here is our comment on this issues.
Alleged 20 BTC bet:
* OP claimed he made a 20 BTC bet on baccarat that did not pay out. He raised this with our customer support.
* Because of the value of the alleged bet, we launched a full investigation immediately. 
* We reviewed all transactions in all of OP's activities - every single deposit and withdrawal to and from their wallet, every single bet and every associated transaction, every bet request, every audit trail log, and every log file. The investigation revealed - definitively and conclusively - that OP did not make a 20 BTC bet on the round he is suggesting. In fact, the player did not make any bet of any size on that particular round.
* No transactions of any kind took place during the game in question. No funds were ever taken from the player's account, nor were any funds credited.
* The live dealer game in question is provided by a third party software company, called Ezugi. We contacted Ezugi and requested that they also perform a complete review and audit. 
* Ezugi confirmed - definitively and conclusively - that OP did not make the 20 BTC bet that he is claiming.
* We informed the player of the above. We also offered to provide him with a full log of all transactions related to his account.
* Ezugi also confirm - definitively and conclusively - that Cloudbet servers did NOT receive a bet request of any kind. Therefore, we could NOT have maliciously ignored a winning bet.
* OP has continued to play in the casino since the incident, even after reporting it on Reddit and AskGamblers. He has played the same live dealer game, as well as other games (including RNG games).
* AskGamblers conducted an investigation - at OP's request - whereby we provided them with all game logs, transaction logs, and a report from Ezugi, and they too concluded that no bet was received and ruled in our favour. 
* In short, we can be certain - definitively and conclusively - that OP did not make any bet in that round. No transactions were made with his account. We would welcome any evidence to the contrary.
**To state it simply and clearly - OP wagered 0 BTC on the hand in question.**
On the video showing the 3 mBTC hand that was not recorded:
We take these issues very seriously and investigate and escalate them with urgency.
* The game was provided by a third party casino software vendor, Ezugi. Cloudbet did not make - nor do we control - the live dealer software.
* In the video, if you watch in the bottom left corner, you will see that no funds leave the player account. The account balance number does not change during the hand. 
* In the hand in question, there is an issue - where chips appear on the table when in fact there is no bet made. No bets were allowed during that period, but the player was able to get chips to display on the screen. The issue is solely visual, that is, chips should not appear on the table when there is no bet.
* No transactions took place during the above hand. In the game in question - no bets were placed and therefore no transactions were made. Had the Player or Banker won in baccarat, the outcome for the player would have been the same.
* We viewed the above as a bug, which we escalated to Ezugi immediately. They have since fixed it.
* We have a bug bounty program whereby we pay a 1 BTC to anyone that reports a bug that we deem important enough to repair. In this case - for the avoidance of doubt - the bug was with a third party system. We paid OP the same bounty as a thank you for reporting the bug.
* The amount of chips that appear to be on the table is 3 mBTC and we - at Cloudbet - do not see this at all. We most certainly do NOT selectively ignore bets. 
Unfortunately, OP has had a losing few sessions and has lost a considerable amount of money and is trying to recover some of it. He has sent us numerous emails in attempts to negotiate a payment of some kind, at threat of negative PR and with 12- and 24-hour deadlines. He has continued to play a variety of different games since the complaint.
Our support has been communicative and polite throughout the process.
We are not in a position to indulge these kind of threats so have suggested that OP escalate his claim to AskGamblers if he wishes. We agree to be bound by their arbitration as long as the player agrees the same. 
Please feel free to raise any questions that you have and we will do our best to answer them. We cannot however divulge any specific details about the player's account or his account history.
I hope this helps clear up some of the misinformation in the thread. Many thanks!

Hi folks,
This is the first we have heard of this issue, but have sent messages to the OP and are currently looking into this issue.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:02:15
We keep all logs and reviewed all in detail. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:25:56
Hi all,
Our database was NOT compromised. Cloudbet servers and services were NOT breached in any way.

Hi there.
Thanks for your messages.
We do not manually review bitcoin withdrawal address (nor do we ever claim to do this), as best practice is to use each wallet address for a single transaction. 
In your case, you requested a withdrawal to a valid bitcoin address, which we processed instantly. You only contacted our support after your withdrawal had already been broadcasted to the blockchain. I appreciate our support staff said they would look into it, but the transaction was already broadcast and funds already sent and therefore unfortunately we were not able to help you at all. Furthermore, we see that the funds have now been spent from the address it was sent to. I can also see that the address was only used for the first time 24 hours prior. Additionally, I can see that you have made successful deposits and withdrawals to your Cloudbet account since then. Therefore, I suggest you contact your wallet service provider to see if they can help you.
I am sorry we cannot be of more help to you. Thanks you for your understanding.
Best regards,

Hey ,
Thanks for getting in touch, and we're sorry to hear you had an issue with our Cloudbet service. We would like to assure you we have not been ignoring you on purpose, our support team was simply following company procedure.
After investigating your case, we can confirm that only 0.1 bitcoin was deposited into your wallet, despite our transaction records showing that both withdrawals were completed. This was an error on our behalf, and measures have been made to ensure this will not happen again.
The outstanding 0.1 bitcoin should now be in your wallet, if not within the next few hours. If you would like to confirm this, the tx hash for this transaction is 86e1d34e8742adbf5226c33aecef95d3210897111a7b3c307dc21cf894947fc4.
Again, we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you, and we hope you will continue to use Cloudbet in the future.
Kind regards,
Dan Kelly and the Cloudbet Team

All passwords are stored securely hashed. And - as per our other post - no passwords were leaked. As you use a 30-char random password which is unique to Cloudbet, your account is totally secure. We reset all user passwords to protect other users who reuse passwords from other sites that were leaked, such as LinkedIn.
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:07:13
Hi all!
To clarify - Cloudbet were NOT hacked, and NO passwords were stolen. We have NOT had a data breach of any kind.
We took proactive steps to reset all users passwords (unless they had 2FA enabled) to prevent users who had their passwords leaked from data breaches at other sites (such as Linkedin) from having their accounts accessed by malicious third parties. This was out of an abundance of caution, as many users reuse the same passwords on multiple sites.
In light of the volume of recent password leaks, and the fact that many users a) reuse passwords, b) have funds in their Cloudbet accounts, and c) these funds are easily withdraw-able, we took a decision to force all users to reset their passwords. Amazon recently took similar steps. 
To repeat - there was NO data breach, and NO passwords were compromised at Cloudbet. 
We strongly urge all users to enable 2FA as this 100% definitively protects you from any kind of unauthorised access.
Here is a useful resource to determine if you have had credentials leaked from any other site:
I'm also able to answer any questions that you have. Thanks!
