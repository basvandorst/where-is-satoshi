Exit scam, you know you can just sell some crypto and wire to your bank within 2 hours right? The cards were always a rip off and conversion rates were terrible at bitpay. If you need money on the weekend and bank is closed bisq can get money into your bank account via zelle at any time.

bisq is good,  had a dispute once. Someone tried to scam me and take my coins, got resolved in two days and not only did I get my coins back but the maximum security deposit I set for the scammer to deposit so I also got some of his money too. No id asked ever.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:54:43
Actually there are only 21 million possible, buy it while you still can!
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:51:47
use bisq where you actually control the wallet and private key.....Localbitcoins sold out to US gov long ago, would not use it unless you want IRS to have your transactions and possibly losing coins like in your case since its not your wallet and you have no private keys.

Good bet, you will win my friend. Look at everyone here sounding like bcash shills its going down, its over, never 10k again by 2020. When you see this it means BTC is about to reverse and leave those noobs behind. Everyone is trying to sound like an expert its going to 100k! its going! Now that its down its going to 1 dollar back to 2010 levels and everyone is wrong, they say it has to hit the low low low before it can do anything because the line on the chart say so. BTC dont give a F\*ck what you think and it will do exactly the opposite, I call 50k usd by EOY 2018.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:58:08
That extra 1000 dollars would be coming from your bitcoin as Yang will track and tax all hodlers to pay for everything.

Sorry bud, its a blockchain.
* Libra is a cryptocurrency minted on the Libra Network, a blockchain developed by a Swiss foundation and a consortium led by **Facebook**.
* Running on a **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain** with a 2-token system, this new financial infrastructure will rely on the BFT-consensus algorithm and will support smart-contracts after it completes its transition from a permissioned to a permissionless environment.
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:52:07
Considering fiat has taken over all monetary transactions it won and gold lost. How about the seashells? Maybe its too early to call their loss too and they can recover and take over.
@_date: 2019-06-20 07:22:43
No us true crypto users support libra as we understand its place and function. It is no threat to BTC or any shitcoin not even XRP or XLM.
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:54:20
Make sure you add the 25th passphrase on top of 24 words and don't let the ledger remember it or your funds can be stolen. It will be more of a pain to go into settings and adding the 25th word passphrase as temporary but much more secure in case you lose your physical device.

Because crypto lol no evidance, when we passed 11k in 2017 we got to 20k real quick, last gain was from 15k to 20k in a single day. With institutional fomo we can blast through 20k easily in a single spike from a huge buy.

Lets say stocks do 100% in 10 years thats terrible returns. Get that overnight on a shitcoin. Bitcoin did over 100% in 3 months, Younger generation is not buying stocks. If you hold any get out before the bubble pops, propped up by company buy backs there is no buyers.

Besides I do not have a day job as crypto is my job so if they ever audit me and ask where that money came from they will see it and I reported it :)

If you sold bitcoins on a regulated exchange and sent them to your bank account you are safer paying taxes, if you avoid the banking system, regulated exchanges and  deal in cash for it then no need to tax anything but that does not mean that the tax man will never ask where you getting this money from. Enough people went to jail for selling bitcoins outside of banking system that tried to avoid tax .  
I paid my taxes on point because I made lots of money, this is not something i would try hiding from the IRS. For the kids with 1000 to 2000 dollars no need to worry. If you are pushing hundreds of thousands you bet your ass you paying capital gains tax.

Yes, best part that machine in specific takes each bill one at a time LOL.
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:54:17
O ok you are taxed just half of your investment, in Canada capital gains tax is 50%.
 **Canada**
**Taxes on gains:** 50 percent (capital gains tax); 25 percent (self-employed)
According to [the government of Canada]( “using digital currency does not exempt consumers from Canadian tax obligations,” which means that cryptocurrencies are subject to the Income Tax Act.
That involves selling cryptocurrencies for a profit, mining and doing crypto-to-crypto transactions — in that case, if, for instance, Bitcoin is used to buy Ethereum, Bitcoin is considered to be sold for its value in Canadian dollars at the time of the transaction.
Taxes for investments, which apply to cryptocurrencies, suggest 50 percent for any such gain in Canada. High-volume traders will have to [file their taxes with the Canada Revenue Agency]( as being self-employed, setting aside around 25 percent of their income.

There are many advanced chain analysis services that can do it, not only will they eventually trace you if they want to but you are also risking sending your bitcoin to someone elses key, many get robbed this way. XMR is untraceable so its easy to get in it, send it through xmr and buy back BTC poof its clean.  I would also say zcash Zaddress is safe but since both Israel and US gov are in on it makes me think its compromised so xmr is the only way.

IT is great, if I was to bankrupt my self id be going back to work in IT just avoid MSP jobs as they will slave you, try to get sys admin, network admin jobs. Biggest downside to IT is working a salary job with a lot of overtime, they do that a lot in MSP world but if you are starting out it will be fine as you will be exposed to many clients and technologies. Demand 10k raises every year if not move on to next job, dont stay more than 2 years at one job as you will be underpaid.

No guns were banned  in Chicago for years and they had to re instate them so citizens can protect themselves, I know I live here. How many knives related murders in UK? When are you going to ban them? You have no freedom so stay your ass in Europe.

Pay your taxes and you wont worry about being flagged. Once flagged the tax man will look into you and see if you paid your taxes on what you made, if all checks out you wont hear a word if not you will get a letter.

Capital gains is capital gains. If you make few hundred thousand or a million in crypto why not pay a little bit of tax to keep IRS happy? As soon as you make a large transfer into a US bank account it will be flagged, you must be 13 investing moms allowance  money so no worries.  
Also coinbase, gemini and other US based crypto exchanges by law will report you to IRS if your transactions are big enough.
