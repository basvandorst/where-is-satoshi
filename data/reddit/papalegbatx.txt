I completely agree. My takeaway from your post is more positive: it reinforces the differences between the two and shows how cryto-currency protocols can be implemented for a wide array of purposes, despite being similar/the same technology.
as pointed out in the other dogecoin thread going on, anything good for one crypto-currency is good for the others... dogecoin's fun, tipping vibe is doing a great job attracting youth, who will someday be more likely to want to use BTC for car payments, bills, etc. and further our goal of widespread adoption

they thought positive outlook on the situation would increase the likelihood of a gox acquisition. therefore, this info would decrease their chances of getting bailed out..... not sure who actually thought reddit posts would influence a multi million $ acquisition more than financial &amp; legal diligence that would occur in that situation, but this is reddit

smart people were also very excited by technologies like Segways, 3d tv, smart watches, etc... but that doesn't mean they're suited for the public.
widespread adoption requires the dumb people, along with the smart, to get excited... which we are very very far from unfortunately.

a lot the software and infrastructure can be adapted to new crytocurrencies. "first mover advantage" is most commonly a myth and disadvantage unless the first mover continually strives to better itself and learn from competition. otherwise, it will simply be a target with arrows in its back. luckily, I dont forsee that happening  due to bitcoin dev's commitment to continually evolving the protocol (thus far). But we must not simply rely on being the "first mover" to provide competitive advantages. If an altcoin introduces a mechanism that addresses a fault of bitcoin, bitcoin dev's must seriously considering adopting those as well. Continual adaptation and evolution must occur because somebody WILL come up with better ideas that improve upon bitcoin.

Unfortunately, there's even risks in transferring to cold storage due to malware, as we've seen over the past week. 
Widespread adoption is going to require trustworthy online wallets. If we're not there yet, then we shouldn't be promoting bitcoin to average consumers yet.
Given coinbase's reputation and financial backing from Andreessen Horowitz and other big time VC's, they're a safer option than cold storage for non-tech savy users who most likely don't have antivirus software and will click any link under the sun

same. best evidence i have is the testimony of my friend who's a 9th grade teacher and mentions it's popularity among the "kids" and how they tip/trade in class... i highly doubt these same kids care about disrupting the banking industry or making long-term investments, so i assume it was dogecoin, not bitcoin, that attracted them to crypto currencies.
but to get your stats, you can always post a poll to asking their age and which cryto they first got into, and which they're now involved in. I'm curious as well

and why would them getting BTC for cheap be a good thing? these guys are trained to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, and would immediately sell the coins on exchanges for the higher market price.
they dont care about holding all the way to the moon.. with this many coins, even a 10% return is a HUGE payday

Whether its UFC or hackathons, the end-goal can still remain the same: the increase consumer adoption.
If we go the route of a hackathon, developers should be challenged to increase consumer adoption by making it easier for non-tech savvy users to use bitcoin. 
This is probably more effective than having the non tech savvy see bitcoin logos on a NASCAR or on a fighter's shorts
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:30:29
I completely agree. We should strive for bitcoin to be accepted by as many merchants as possible.
However, that alone will not help spread the use of bitcoin. What is needed is incentive and an easier ability for consumers to use it... and i'm not talking about you and me. I'm talking about less tech-savy consumers.
The focus should be on making it easier for my 65 year old mother, for instance, (who buys almost *everything* on Amazon) to see the benefit and ease of bitcoin's use. Until then, it will just be you and me using our bitcoins on Amazon or Overstock. And we alone are not enough incentive to promote merchant adoption.

The most important questions untouched by your post are how good he is? How many tournaments does he do? How big are those tournaments? Average fan attendance?
Or is this just a charity case to fund a guy to surf around the world, with the biggest hope of his surfer friends seeing bitcoin's use?

fyi, perceived battle lines are drawn because of comparisons like this... while it may not have been your intent, this post comes off as trying to put down for not being about community, tipping, or thanking each other as much as bragging about dogecoin donations and following it up with "what has bitcoin done?" doesn't help either
however, most people realize they are different coins for different reasons. Bitcoin wishes to change banking and financial markets (as seen in the results of your bitcoin wordcloud). Dogecoin has more charitable intentions (also as seen in the results of your dogecoin wordcloud).... therefore, there is no surprise in the results of your wordcloud comparison

they have controls over the monetary base (MB), but they can only use various controls to indirectly influence the amount that is in circulation (as measured by M1, M2, or M3). for example, a large amount of the funds that they created for QE spending is still held at the fed in 'excess reserves'. if they think the banks will start to withdraw these funds, they can increase interest rates on excess reserves to have some control on how much is released into common circulation, or alter reserve requirements, or sell reverse-repurchase agreements to counter-balance the withdrawals while using their newly acquired bonds as collateral (all recently discussed options by the fed)

And with this being an unregulated, free market, bitcoin is evolving for the better due to the risk of repeated events. Unlike the financial markets that recieve bailouts, there is no moral hazard occurring in bitcoin. Lessons are being learned, to their full extent. Demand for better security and transparency will force exchanges to change. Meanwhile, mortgage bankers are doing the same shit they did pre-2007. The resulting response and actions of the other bitcoin exchanges have given me more faith in the protocol and industry than marky mark and gox's failure took away. Consumer demand is truly shaping this industy in accordance with its desires. The same will never be said of traditional banking.

anyone can send coins to that wallet and leave a message
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:01:01
i assume youre asking about the 29k coins, not the irrelevant .001 transaction that includes the aforementioned message. 
there's no telling who's wallet the 1Ez69SnzzmePmZX3WpEzMKTrcBF2gpNQ55 belongs to.. but since the first transaction was today, i'm guessing its not an exchange. however that doesnt mean the coins were not sold. sales can occur outside of exchanges to private buyers.
29k coins aren't just moved for no reason. hence the speculation.

there's a chance that the bidding goes above market value. 
buying that many coins from exchanges is very difficult and would require multiple purchases over time, moving the market upward while doing so. 
this is an opportunity for big buyers looking to make a large, single transaction from a trusted vendor
obviously i could be wrong, but its important think about the upside potential too
