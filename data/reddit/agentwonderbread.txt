Yeah, but they're not innocent people.. So it's not really murder for hire, right?

A scare to intimidate people? It's a lesson to protect your shit. He left everything open, and documented all of his illegal use.. He deserves to be thrown away.

Do you have a reason not to?

Probably, or did? I'd love to see into your thought process of how they planted the journal there. 
How do you explain the blockchain linking DPR to Ross?

Definitely sarcasm.

I haven't seen any. Would you care to link/explain, or continue to beat around the bush?

I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first.. But that's a lot of evidence the proves he did it. The guy was an idiot from the beginning, and will now pay for it with his freedom.

Is he responsible for what happens on the site? Yes. 
Not sure how you can compare selling fake stuff to selling illegal stuff, when we both know that America has a huge war on drugs. 
Also, your original argument was the ross looks like a boy scout. How the fuck is that an argument? I know, you must work for his defense team as well.
