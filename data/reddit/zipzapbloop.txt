Exactly! This point is so crucial to understanding what a blockchain is and why it's valuable, and yet almost nobody seems to appreciate it right now (i.e. the proliferation of alt-coins is evidence that a lot of people don't understand the significance of a blockchain).
Blockchains are not important because they're currency. Blockchains are important because they can be the most secure, trusted, widely distributed and accessible accounting book in the history of the world. So much of human activity has to do with accounting. Blockchain is a huge idea!
But, if we're going to immutably encode currency transactions, and smart contracts, and form corporations, and record public records in a blockchain, then we're going to want it to be the most secure blockchain. The most secure chain is the one with the most hash power. Right now that's bitcoin. It's possible for it to get overthrown, but I think odds are good it sticks around as the most computationally secure blockchain to put information in.
So, yeah, you can get excited about *blockchain technology* and think you're avoiding talk of bitcoin, but the on-the-ground fact is that bitcoin is the blockchain you want to be putting information in if you want it to be secure. And for the same reason, yeah, some alt-coins and forks are neat and all but we're quickly approaching a point at which the capital and infrastructure devoted to the most secure chain (i.e. bitcoin) are too great to be overcome by another chain and the world's resources and capital that are interested in blockchain are committed.

Ok, I just got off the phone with a very kind IRS agent who explained much of what we've already gathered. If you got 6174 or 6174-A, then unless you have good reason to believe you didn't comply (in my case I don't, as I've explained in a few place), then treat the letters as essentially informational. She stated that their resources are very limited and even said that the letters were sent to some 13,000 who had Coinbase accounts. Yes, she actually said "Coinbase accounts", which seems to confirm the suspicion that this is related to that. She said she's spoken with others in my same position (people who hired tax attorneys and accountants to help them interpret the relevant laws and guidelines) and she's been trying to relieve some of the fear the letter caused. Basically, if you believe yourself to have done your due diligence, then just file the letter away and keep paying your taxes. If you got 6173, on the other hand, then you've got some work to do. Pay your taxes folks!
@_date: 2019-07-29 21:37:57
Yeah, I know right.
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:12:46
Hmm...your experience stands as another little clue that these letters were basically sent to everyone from the Coinbase case a year or two ago, which would be both a relief and annoying -- annoying that so little care is taken to understand the data they would have and so great a nuisance was sent out into the world. That said, it's not that big a deal, I guess. But it does seem heavy handed in a very clunky way.
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:20:15
I kinda feel foolish for doing so, but I called the number and left a message asking for clarification regarding the "information" the letter claims they have. Since I know what I did, and I did it based on the advice of relevant professionals, I can't even begin to conceive of what information they have. Knowing what they have would help me identify an error if there is, in fact, an error. Merely claiming to have information, but failing to share it, leaves somebody like me, who sincerely tried to comply AND knowingly overpaid, with nothing to do. I honestly don't even know where to look.
And that naturally raises the question of both the quality of their information and how well or not they're drawing inferences from it. It's all very annoying.
I called on Friday. No response yet. So I'm kinda just waiting right now. I don't know what else to do.

It's frustrating to hear it's backed by nothing. It's also frustrating to hear (almost exclusively) that bitcoin is a currency. I'll take these in reverse order.
Bitcoin is becoming a pretty bad currency. Transaction fees are *relatively* high. That's an emerging property of bitcoin itself, though not a necessary one. And in the US at least, it's also be discouraged as a currency because it's not taxed like one. Bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax for any exchange of it -- for cash, for gold, for Nintendo Switches, for cars, for hookers and blow. Any non-like-kind transfer of bitcoin for a good or service is a taxable event. Sure, those of us who've accumulated some a while back might not give a shit about the tax we may impose on ourselves. But that doesn't change the fact that it's quite an expensive currency to use when you consider both its transaction fees and tax consequences (in the US, at least). None of this is to say it can't be used as a currency. And it's not to say that it can't back something that might sit on top of bitcoin that can be more sensibly used as a day to day currency. Which brings me to...
What is bitcoin backed by? Bitcoin is much, much bigger and more important than a decentralized currency. The broader idea that encapsulates its use as a currency is the blockchain. Bitcoin happens to be the biggest one and the one I'm most excited about. The blockchain is an old and fairly simple idea made new again - the accounting book. The broadest conception of bitcoin is as a digital, decentralized, distributed, immutable, trust-less, accounting book. I don't think that fact is spoken about enough. And I think it's the biggest deal about it. It's a much bigger deal than its use as a currency, which is a sub-use of accounting, IMO. *Think of all that goes on in the world that depends on accounting*. Bitcoin can do all of that stuff (or at least be the protocol layer that anything accounting related sits atop), including, yes, be a currency too. That's what *backs* bitcoin. It's utility as a global accounting book, and all that you can do with a powerful global ledger that can't be fucked with, and that no one entity controls.
A bitcoin, then, isn't merely a currency. It's a right. To own a bitcoin (or any portion of one) is to own rights to write information to the global accounting book. In my opinion, the smart, forward looking money is after bitcoin for that reason. They want to be able to sell those rights. They're betting on the biggest, most secure blockchain, and betting that in the future they'll be able to sell those rights to all the people, companies, and bots that need those rights to buy things, conduct business, form companies, distribute digital assets, form contracts, or whatever the fuck else you can do with a global accounting book (and I'm sure tons of shit hasn't even been thought up yet).
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:57:42
This makes me feel better as a recipient of 6174-A. I consulted both an attorney and our accountant before selling and made every reasonable effort to accurately report everything, and even went so far as to assume a zero cost basis because of the complexity of tracking everything down, so I definitely paid more in taxes than what I actually owed, but I was so freaked out about getting audited I just wanted to be able to say I interpreted everything as generously as possible (in the government's favor).

This expresses a bigger idea that bitcoin (blockchians) will be a part of, perhaps the biggest part -- efficient resource allocation.
In my view, it's unfortunate that most people look at bitcoin as a currency. It can be a currency, but its broader, more world changing contribution to humanity is as *a global, distributed, accounting book*. Just think of how much human activity is wrapped up in accounting. Its use as a currency is really a sub-use of the broader, and more wide sweeping use as an accounting book. And, I'm just gonna say it, I'm not sure Satoshi himself appreciated this fact well. Or, perhaps, he did, but knew it was easier to sell as a currency. I don't know.
Ethereum is trying to build more tools into the protocol, which is cool. I'm not convinced it's necessary, but in any event, a blockchain (distributed, unfuckable, accounting book) is a space where people and companies can interact globally and trustlessly. Companies can be formed with blockchain contracts that automate payment, for example. You can imagine a future where human work isn't a matter of a single job. Instead people freely and organicly contract with companies organized on the blockchain and get paid for their little contribution, and all the accounting, or most of it anyway, is right there, immutably written into the global accounting book.
For me, the big deal about owning bitcoin isn't owning a currency, though I know I can and have used it that way. The really big deal is owning the right to write information to a global accounting book. I expect I'll be able to sell those rights well into the future to people, companies, bots, whoever needs more of the underlying asset to enable them to write more information to the global ledger.

From the article:










Can somebody help me understand how gold is different than USD, bitcoin, and notched sticks? To our species it's turned out as a matter of history and our social development that gold has some utility. Sure, it's very long running, and it has a handful of useful properties for this or that. But isn't this just a difference in scope and not kind? Why is gold treated as something with some sort of special *intrinsic*-not-socially-produced value, but bitcoin and USD and notched sticks are all *intrinsically* worthless, but for *utility-driven demand*.  What are gold's properties with respect to our species that are over and above some sort of utility-driven demand? I just don't get it.

If you're gonna HODL, then be prepared for a depressing crash. Probably. I don't know.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:02:12
So when people talk about gold's intrinsic value, does their use of "intrinsic value" refer to this difference in scope? Or, do lots of people in love with gold really believe it has a property of another kind, and that's what's giving it the intrinsic value they love to talk about. 
I've always been confused by this, and I've never been able to understand, assuming many people believe gold has a property of a different kind, what it could possibly be that doesn't reduce to some fact or collection of facts about our species' historical development (i.e. its utility-driven demand and historic attachment/nostalgia), and, therefore, reduce to the same sorts of properties of USD, bitcoin, and notched sticks.

Sorry, didn't mention that that's the bitstamp market depth. I don't know a site that combines the total market depth at all price levels, but just swithing between markets using bitcoinity and zooming out on the order book, it looks like there's ~350 million is cash displaying itself on the books.
That's just the visible USD cash announcing to the world that it's there and in the market for bitcoin from 7 markets bitcoinity shows. Once you consider the dark pools, OTC markets, non-USD exchanges...there's gotta be ~10 billion in actual fiat sloshing around in that thing. That's a lot, no doubt. But it's really just a signal to the entire world. Something like, "Hi, anyone who has any money. It's time to take me seriously now".

For a long time I used a separate, offline computer with Ubuntu and Electrum. It can be a good method. You can setup Electrum to perform air gapped transactions. There's a guide on Electrum's website. ***Make sure you are getting Electrum from the right source***. Hardware wallets, like Ledger or Trezor, are, IMO, a much better balance of security and simplicity than managing your own offline system, but what you're proposing can work well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:14
Both the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets are very good. Read up on both of them, consider their prices, and pick the one you like. You can't really go wrong with either.

I love comments like, "Dude, if the price falls to X imma buy a shit load". For most people who say stuff like that, no, no you won't. Because when the price gets to X from wherever it was the market and its forces will likely look different to you and you'll be taking all that new information into account, often worrying about whether, because it's gone to X, it'll keep going even lower.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:20
No, you don't need to run your own node with Trezor. Visit the website and watch some videos on how it works. Check out Ledger, too. It's a good one as well.

Compare the last 5 months to that insane, parabolic 5 month MtGox run. I think a lot people are snickering at these guys predicting $40-100k bitcoins in the next year. Among other things, I think those guys are looking at market depth. They're calculating how much actual cash must be piling into markets in search of bitcoins in exchange. I think they're estimating that it is becoming a serious economic movement. And I think they're seeing that this much cash has a very strong magnetic force that is going to draw in worldwide wealth.
Here's the last 5 months:

Tech for me. A distributed, global accounting book. I mean, Jesus Christ. Think of how much of our species' activity is wrapped up in accounting. Blockchains are a big deal. Their security is a big deal. The blockchain with the best security is the biggest deal. That's bitcoin right now. Could it be something else? Absolutely! But I think bitcoin's got good odds.
Honestly, and I'm probably gonna get downvoted for this, but it's kind of unfortunate that the blockchain idea is so wrapped up in the idea of currency. It can do that, no doubt. And that's cool. But the much bigger deal here is a distributed global accounting book -- a distributed ledger. This technology will end up managing the wealth and resource allocation of the entire world eventually. It will manage contracts and organize corporations and companies.
What you're buying isn't a currency. You're buying the ability to write to a global accounting book that can't be fucked with. And you actually probably won't need to personally own much to conduct yourself in the future. But if you own a lot, oh boy.

Coinbase has so far been pretty trustworthy. Again, make sure you're using a strong password for the site that you don't repeat anywhere else, and enable 2fa.
And, again, the test for whether a convenient online wallet is ok for you is how much you can or cannot tolerate losing the value you keep there. I'd feel fine keeping $1,000 on coinbase, but you need to assess that for yourself.
You should go through the steps to link your coinbase account to your bank account. Once that's complete, then, yes, transferring dollars from coinbase to your bank account is pretty straightforward, though it can take a few days to complete.

Yep. Pretty easy. When you sell on coinbase they don't actually credit your coinbase account with USD that you then have to transfer out. They just send the USD value of your sell directly to your bank account. Again, it can take a few days sometimes.

To maximize security, as opposed to just moving private keys from blockchain.com to a device or other wallet, yes, you will have to pay transaction fees if you're sending bitcoin from blockchain.com to a new address on a Trezor or other device.


I don't know how to quantify this. Whatever the odds are, they're higher in terms of risk on blockchain.com versus a hardware wallet. That isn't to say that blockchain.com is bad. But it's just a fact that hardware wallets are more secure.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:53:41
I haven't used it. I've heard good things about it. Hardware or another offline wallet option is best for amounts of value that you would hate to lose.
Use online wallets for amounts of value that you could tolerate losing. A lot of people, myself included, use online wallet services for a little spending money, but keep significant amounts in offline storage, like hardware wallets.

As somebody who experienced the MtGox flash crash of 2011 (literally watched the price go to basically zero and thought I had lost everything I put in at the time), and has hodld through every crash since, this is pretty mundane.

Bitcoin is an important development in computer science and will be an important part of how humans conduct business, but, with the exception of censorship resistance as a payment mechanism, it is a pretty awful payment platform and is an atrocious currency.
In fact, it's a bit of a bummer, as far as I'm concerned, that bitcoin is called a "cryptoCURRENCY" and the units of account are called "bitCOINS". Perhaps it needed the allure of being a currency to attract the necessary initial investment, but whatever the case may be as far as that goes, it fucking sucks as a currency and payment platform. Transaction fees for ordinary purchases are at least unpredictable, and usually relatively high in terms of ways to pay for things like coffee. The unpredictability of its value also makes it a pretty bad currency. It's tendency to increase in value over time compels people not to spend it, making it a bad currency. In many places, like the United States, it's tax treatment discourages spending because unlike spending dollars or Venmo or whatever, my bitcoin purchases have an additional tax tacked onto to them through capital gains, and that's a concern whether I exchange it for dollars, or other cryptos, or a car, or a cup of coffee.
The real shitty thing is that people are so hung up on its use as a currency alternative that they're almost completely blind to the enormous utility it has in other, arguably more important and sustainable ways. At its core, bitcoin is a decentralized, global, immutable accounting book. Its usable tokens (bitcoins) give users rights (exclusive or cooperative rights) to put information into this accounting book (the blockchain). Once information goes into the accounting book (i.e. gets written to the blockchain), that specific information cannot be changed. That information becomes, for all intents and purposes, immutable. And all that information can be checked and validated by anyone with sufficient know how and access to the accounting book, which is anyone with an Internet connection.
Sure, swap tokens around (bitcoin) in place of dollars to buy a Nintendo Switch from your friend if you want. But that's just one sub-use of the tokens of this particular type of database, and in my view it's the least interesting and least world changing use of a system like this. Just think about accounting and its history. Our species' invention of accounting changed human history and altered how we structure social life. We're basically standing at the dawn of the next greatest innovation in how we...account for...things. Anything. Everyone can tap into a shared, decentralized, distributed, and immutable accounting book. Think about all the human activity wrapped up in accounting. It's so much more than a currency alternative.
Imagine a future like this for just one novel domain. You're set to buy a new house. The property rights to the property you're buying need to reflect you as the new owner. You still pay fees and closing costs to a lender and perhaps even a title company to move information around, but part of those fees go to the county recorder's office. And those fees pay the county to send a bitcoin transaction that encodes the details of the property transfer into the blockchain. There will be no question who owns what property. What does the county do with the fee you pay as part of your closing costs? Part of those fees pays the recorder to do their job, but part of those fees are used by the county to buy more bitcoin! They won't need a lot, but they'll always be a net buyer of small amounts. Because they need at least some in order to own rights to write information to the accounting book (the blockchain). Now just imagine thousands of counties or perhaps hundreds of thousands of localities or state or federal offices using this technology in this way. In the future there will be millions upon millions of users, and companies, and bots that are constant buyers of little amounts of bitcoin. Not because they need "coins" to use as digital "currency", but because they need rights to put information into a global accounting book, and the only way to have those rights is to own some amount of bitcoin.
Owning bitcoin is fundamentally unlike owning currency. Owning bitcoin is much more like owning land. People who own a decent amount of bitcoin right now will effectively become like large land owners. They'll be in a position to "parcel" off parts of their bitcoin wealth as suppliers to users who need to own bitcoin in order to set information in the world's most secure accounting book. And they'll need those rights for use cases like the one I just described, but also for lots of others like contracts or establishing businesses and lots of things nobody has even thought of yet.
Yes, owning bitcoin is to own something you can use as a (bad) currency. But more importantly, owning bitcoin is to own rights to put information in an important kind of accounting book. That's the value of bitcoin, which as far as I can tell, has not been well considered yet by the market.
