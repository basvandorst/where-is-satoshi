funny you say that 
remember in the 90s when microsoft wanted an internet superhighway where microsoff controlled all the toll booths?
this was bigger ideological news than even ie4/netscape and yet nobody remembers.

well if you live at home with your parents I guess it doesn't matter.
But if i go to a merchant and pay with my btc I expect it to be handled in a timely manner at low cost, or is that unreasonable now?

I'm going to read the actual analysis which is here: 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:40:58
I'm trying to learn and understand but can't seem to find a straight answer.
What does it take to spam the mempool in this way? 
If it's spam then what protection mechanisms are there to prevent/stop this from happening later when there is wider adoption?
Is there any way to identify the transactions that are spam when I look? Do you look for repeating patterns?
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:12:20
2 wallets can spam bitcoin network to this point?
How much money do you need to send between 2 addresses, including fees, to do this? Is it thousands of BTC worth?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:58:36
possession implies demand.
demand implies supply.
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:16:54
I looked at  and concluded that BTC has the lions share of all of the miners?
What are the other factors?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:01:47
Ok so the term spam is a misnowmer then?
So what causes the backlog of transactions in the mempool? If BCH wasn't sharing hashpower would it still be occuring?

We're not talking about people who don't know about it.
we're talking about people who have it. Tell me, do you jack it to porn? Do you reuse the same 2-3 scenes for 20 years? If you do, you're in the 0.1% of anyone who consumes porn.
They will continue to place a demand on more scenes.

@_date: 2017-10-27 05:29:22
I'm not gonna lie, I'd keep that bitcoin.
More is stolen from me be the government by way of taxes every year.
I already do donate to private charity; but btc charity starts at home, ese.
People can down vote me from their pedastool of supposed morality but atleast I don't lie to myself.

@_date: 2017-09-26 01:27:04
it's in my pocket. How can I spend it? Should I wait for bitcoin to hit $500k and throw it down on a lamborghini? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:51:37
That's racist.
Prove you not racist send me 20BTC as USD via Western Union.

Go to the bank, try to get a homeloan or business loan in the market from 2018-2020 (I'll give it a year to recover)
tell me if they consider this "savings" or "collateral" for a loan.
What you've described also fails to demonstrate that bitcoin functions as a unit of account (pro tip, it fails)
