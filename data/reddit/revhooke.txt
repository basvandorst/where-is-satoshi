Interesting whether we will see a digital portfolio manager for cryptocurrencies. Could connect to Mint.com and actively readjust, or readjust on a monthly/biweekly basis. I like the idea of passive investing sites such as lawnmower.io.

I think this is a reasonable estimate for the value of Bitcoin. Really would be surprised if it captured more than 1%. That being said we need to account for the chance that bitcoin goes to zero to truly consider how to allocate funds.

I have the same problem, mobile and desktop. Research below. 
It has happened before, should be back soon. I've sent a message to their customer service, and will update when I get a response.

BTCJam.com although when I tested for about 6 months there was a number of scammers, lost about 10% of what I invested even after gains from the loans that did pay off. If you stick to A and B rated borrowers you may make a return. Problem is the loans you invest in are difficult to sell if you want your BTC back, so typically you have to hold until the term of the loan.

How so? Have we seen it function that way?

I feel like domain names are a good analogy, but they lack fungibility (facebook.com is worth more than asdfacasdf.com) unlike Bitcoin.

Q: What is the cost associated with using MasterCard MoneySend?
A: MoneySend fees are set by the individual participating banks. Contact your participating bank to find out more about costs.

I agree, they are similar in the history of their valuation but it would be hard for someone to conceptualize Beanie Babies and Bitcoin as comparable asset types

Puerto Rico is a US territory, not a country

How do you avoid the following?
Coinbase: For US Customers, orders less than $15 are charged a flat fee of $0.15. For European customers, there is a bank fee of €0,15 for withdrawals.

Thanks for the reply! I really like this idea, but probably won't use it because its cost prohibitive for anyone that uses CCs for the majority of their purchases like me. Any ideas on working around that extra CC purchase fee?

Didn't realize that was a feature, +1 user! Thanks for your help!

It says it only charges the Coinbase fee, but Coinbase charges extra for credit cards. Is that credit card fee passed on to the cardholder when you make a purchase with credit or does it charge 1% regardless of the type of card?

Many people have electricity included in their rent, so $0 for anyone that is actually mining
