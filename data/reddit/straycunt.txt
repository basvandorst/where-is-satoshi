We should let natural evolution do its thing and let better cryptocurrencys take over instead of fucking the whole system up for everyone

You know btc is going well when this rubbish makes the top of the page..

Just started myself. You will soon realise the stock market is a continuous pump and dump. Many are prediction another GFC which looks like it may have already started.. So be careful

This is why you ass holes should embrace all crypto tec. Not just btc. The governments won't try and take down one cryptocurrency if there's plenty more thriving. Just like dark markets, they realise it's a total fucking waste of time taking one down when there's hundreds of others

Haha your a sad little man. You saying so doesn't make it true

Everyone that has left will come back soon enough when they can't get their money out of bankrupt banks
