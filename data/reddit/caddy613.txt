I have 4 employees in the Philippines and send their wages through rebit.ph ever week.  It literally takes about 30 seconds to complete the transactions and have never had an issue.  It lands in their checking account as local currency they never know the difference.  I have my stash of bitcoin for safekeeping but I also keep an account tied to my business and also one for personal use that I use as much as possible but reload every time I use it or just continually buy it so those accounts continue to grow with btc.

This makes me scared to sell on coinbase because I had the same experience last week, although the funds did arrive about 72 hours later.  It seemed that customer service knew the funds would land by the emails they were sending but I certainly don't want to go through this sort of thing this user is experiencing.  When they tell you the funds will be there next day and they're not it's a little never rattling and in business accounts time can be more sensitive.  Huge bitcoin fan here only reason I am posting is so coinbase gets it together.  Having funds floating around for several days with no answers is not good.

Worked for me.  Save $.40 cents on a padded pack.

I will be ordering one thanks.  Sitting 12-15 hours/day behind a desk is taking a toll on me.  Of course I will use btc

the instant you even mention to a buyer (through the ebay messaging service) that you will want them to pay with btc you will get kicked off ebay if they flag your message.

How come you don't link an ebay account they have the best reputation based system out there?
