The line was probably more like: "Bitcoin lacks monetary properties and is 'pure speculation', but i'm gonna speculate it's gonna be huge"

You do you. Just realize that the wealthiest people, companies and government aren't gonna roll over and be happy with giving up all their control, so there are enough ways Bitcoin isn't the be all, end all apocalypse-saver some people make it out to be. Look at the spike BTCUSD made when China's president utters the word Bitcoin. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a big risk. It would feel even better is you would have 100% trust in gold because it has proven to be a stable asset, but again: you do you. 
The line "my risk tolerance is very high" screams a lack of hard life lessons (you sound young and naive, not fully aware how much influence you have on your future), but if this is a life lesson you are willing to risk, I sincerely hope it works out and you can live your dream.

We need gold in a lot of electronic applications as well. On top of that with Gold&gt;Silver&gt;Iron&gt;Copper, there's a constantly fluctuating supply/demand for each of them, so we would have to deal with bread costing 55 copper one day and 65 the other day, and some days 55 copper being worth 1 iron and the other day it's 45. It would be a hassle... Right now we have (i.e. USD-EUR) SOME fluctuation, but nowhere near as bad as metals.

i'm looking at it objectively: from half May next year the amount of bitcoin won't be expanded by 12.5 but 6.25 every 10 minutes. At the current price (roughly), that's $100,000 every 10 minutes, that's 14.4 million dollars every day, almost half a billion every month. That amount added each 10 minutes will be halved.
I see no real reason (except for government, political or other world-trend intervening, although that would only make clearer how much the world needs bitcoin) there will be a change in how many people want their share of bitcoin, therefore:
demand stays equal vs. supply halves. I see no way that won't have a positive impact on the price of bitcoin.
My assessments and thought (but beware, all speculation): it seems we are in a bearish channel until we hit 8k (is where bearish meets rising support), where we can bounce off or could see a steep drop, maybe even to 4k (analysis shows this is still possible, even though that would mean we would straddle or go out of every big bandwidth calculation). Tax-wise this could be interesting for a lot of people (to go into the new year on a low price). 2020 will start bullish, with maybe another big drop, but stay bullish for a while towards and after the halving.

weird explanation of HODL...

Not able to let things go is usually because you ascribe too much emotional value to something. Be that a vase, a box a toy came in or a relationship.
Holding on to Bitcoin has nothing to do with an emotion, but trust that it becomes more than it is now. Or do you think that people that want to work to make money so they can save some money on an account and watch that number grow is also a form of 'not able to let go'?
2 totally different things. Don't burn people down because they have more trust in Bitcoin than in Euro or Dollar. That's basically what's happening here.

1. DON'T GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T MISS! It may take a minute to make a profit, it may take a month, a year, or never!
2. Always having some extra for when the price dips below your bandwith or accept there will be times you will feel shitty for not buying the dip
3. Make a assesment of what you will do when the prices keep going up. Will you move your bandwith up? How fast? How much?
4. Try to have some btc you are not selling for if it goes up and doesn't reach your bandwith in the short term or the long term.
5. Don't handle out or emotion! Just, don't! Make a well thought out strategy, keep to your strategy, and have confidence in your strategy. Remember your rules, and play by your rules. Don't accept 4.5% because you THINK something, don't buy EXTRA because you HEARD something. No emotion, algorithm.
6. AGAIN: DON'T GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T MISS! There's a big change that after the big spike of last week we are in the downward trend for some time to come, and noone can say with certainty it will ever go up again. Halving won't change this, it may make the change smaller, but there will ALWAYS BE A RISK.

People on average inherently don't understand technology and don't WANT to understand it.
 When the first iPhone was announced i couldn't believe that it worked that smoothly. I had to get one in hand and swipe through contacts to actually accept and believe that anything like this was possible. Right now, it's totally normal, and doing it any other way would feel wrong.
The same thing goes for cellular calling. There is a Dutch video that shows people laughing at the idea of having a mobile phone: "why would i need one? I'm not that important". "people can wait until i'm home", etc. But in as little as 10-20 years we have become a species that couldn't even fathom the idea that you couldn't reach someone if you needed them.
The growth is slow but steady, and as anything digital, bitcoin has the ability to scale to inifnity if the market demands it. You are on the forefront of this technology. Just accept that other people don't feel the need to be there, and know that you'll be rewarded/
If you want to have a bit of fun: Instead of giving people fiat money for their birthday, just for a year give them a wallet address with the equivalent in bitcoin. Tell them to just hold on to it for 10 years and thank them later ;-)

It's a gamble. Some are saying a new rally is coming, others are saying 100k by 2020, others are saying 55k by halving... I'm having confidence in Stock-to-Flow ratio, but i know it's no truth... Truth is, looking at the graph, there has been a gradual downward trend of 1000$ a month. That's some piece of advice you could take, but it doesn't mean anything...
Supply demand would say the price should be somewhere around $ 8.132 / 8.324 ( [ ).

Funny thing is, i was talking to my father in law about bitcoin a few months ago. He makes some money trading stock, so i was telling him about putting a small percentage towards bitcoin, go long on it. He said he didn't have trust in it, because it is based on nothing...
Okay, i can SEE where you're coming from, but what does actually have a valid basis nowadays, i asked him. Well, dollars, etc. Ehm, what do you think it's based on? Gold, was his answer... "Well, do i have a story for you".
In the end, he still isn't sure of bitcoin and he would rather put money into gold than bitcoin, which i can understand.
But there's still so many people that can't comprehend the fact that their savings, be it dollars or euros or any other currency, are a simple integer in an oracle database of an bank, an institution that literally gambles your money 9-fold, while we're at a point where &gt;50% of banks are hanging in the balance of an impending crisis and the only way we can trust this all working out is governments. The same governments that keep printing 2-3% of the total worth on a yearly basis, and are now creating even more money and giving out types of loans with great workarounds to big corporations that put that money back in stocks to push stocks further away from a fair and workable point. I see no workable solution coming from this, only hyper-inflation, in which case more and more people will try to find safe havens, away from traditional currencies with the only way for governments to stop this is to tax the hell out of that...

np, just so you know: look at the last months and it looks like we are in a downward trend of roughly $1000 a month. You are choosing to ride the waves in between the trend, but know that in a downward trend it might be hard to reach the profits sometimes and IF you are choosing to take this trading strategy account for the fact that you may slowly find it will stand still. I suggest to first observe, put some numbers in a spreadsheet and see if you are happy with your strategy.

Comsumer protection is only in place for stupid mistakes. Banks charge you monthly so they have some money on hand for these mistakes. Basically we all pay the banks a 'stupidity protection fee', or a 'tax to pay off stupid'. People are less likely to hold themselves accountable because we have a lot of protection in place. In Dutch we call this the rubberentegelparadijs, roughly translated the 'cushioning tile paradise', like how they put softer tiles underneath playgrounds, so the children don't fall on concrete, etc. But falling from a playground and hurting yourself is a great way to learn to 1. don't take on things you are not comfortable doing, and 2. try to size up the endeavor you are going to take.
I.e.: bitcoin doesn't have protection, because we shouldn't have protection in the first place. If that sounds dangerous to you or anyone, i've got a few simple rules:
1. keep your money safe
2. don't do anything stupid
3. don't do illegal things
If those rules sound perfectly acceptable to you, you've got nothing to fear

looking at the inflation rate of the dollar the amount of available dollars never kept anyone from wanting more dollars. Supply vs demand.
The reason there would be multiple cryptos is because of the underlying foundation and it's reasons for existence (i.e. fungibility, non-only-digital, government-backed, ability for inflation, etc.).

[ literally the first hit i got on google when searching for 'bitcoin chart with halvings'.
You are right that the future isn't based on the past, but remember that a halving means that the amount of new potential mined bitcoins that can go up for sale goes down drastically:
2012 halving reduced the new supply by $302,400 per week.  
2016 halving reduced the new supply by $8,190,000 per week.  
2020 halving will reduce the new supply by $63,000,000 per week.
this is not to say that the coming halving will make the price sky rocket, for instance, what if all mined bitcoins aren't going up for sale but are being hodled, but it gives a good view on why a halving is a big deal.

Your German bank N26 is a great idea: no monthly costs, no interest (negative or positive), just a simple product with a simple business plan. When the economy would collapse i can see the big banks having lots of problems when the domino's start falling. I can see (but not sure) N26 doing things differently and staying out of harm's way. Only thing is you're still subject to governments meddling and inflation.

there are plenty of ways now where you could buy something that isn't covered by any insurance, for instance buying something from a street vendor, or buying something second hand online. 
If this starts to become a real problem there could be a service where you won't both need to sign off on the transaction and in the meantime the money will be in a safe place.
