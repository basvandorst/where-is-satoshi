I was thinking about it, but I wasn't sure how a second account would reflect on my credit score. I'm working diligently to get it as high as possible. It's sort of become a game for me to see it get better each month.

I'll dig a hole with a shoe. That will show them. We can do anything if we put our minds to it, and have a strong enough shoe.

Haha. You are all certainly far from being mean. I honestly appreciate how much I've learned from lurking here. Thanks for the tip too!

Well thanks! I'll probably open a second account to stay more secure.
Have a nice night.

MotoX is a great jump as well.

Thank you all so much. Looking into it, if I verify my checking account, the worst that could happen is that someone takes my money in checking. I don't believe they could access my savings, despite them being linked through my provider to one account.
I wish I could thank you all, but instead I have upvoted each of you. Thanks again.

Tagging you as BitCoin Bro.
That was an extremely nice thing to do. I hope lots of real life karma is headed your way!
Edit: wow how did I stumble on month old posts... Sorry about the notification.

Elon doesn't run PayPal, he only helped to create it. The funds he got from the buy out are what funds his new companies. So yes, we will upvote Tesla stuff. I'm not sure what your point is supposed to be.
