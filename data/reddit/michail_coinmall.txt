Soft fork is just adding new features to existing code so that it's compatible with all existing wallets/miners, and it shares same blockchain, there are no 'transfers' between soft forks

No worries, you can read more technical details here:

It will be 'fixed' once the block reward gets lower and lower (it halves every 210k blocks, next halving will happen in ~2020) so that it's more profitable to include as much txs as possible
At the moment there are 200 000 transactions in mempool having ~100 BTC in fees
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:14:27
There are roughly 144 blocks per day, and each block fits ~2500 transactions, but because price is skyrocketing mempool is flooded atm, so it might take couple more days I'm afraid (mempool is usually relatively empty during weekends)
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:28:27
You need to wait until X confirmations for deposits usually, and to get it through fast you need to pay a decent tx fee (which is ~$15 at the moment)
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:13:55
Really doubt it about it happening tomorrow.. give it a week at least :D
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:52:08
You still get a block reward even if you don't include all transactions from mempool, and block reward is $200k+ at the moment :)

You can search for Bitcoin client and/or "wallet.dat" file on your HDD if you still use the same computer/disk
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:05:38
There are soft forks and hard forks, e.g. changing block size is a hard fork, segwit is a soft fork

Glad you found it :D

100 sat/byte is not that high, there are ~ 100 000 transaction with 100+ sat/byte tx fee in the mempool at the moment, so you need to wait for at least ~40 blocks  
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:21
Soft fork is an update only if that updated code ends up in 'original' github repo :) I.e. anyone can create soft forks, but only core devs can make it an update

You do realize that most of users just visit Reddit to scroll through without worrying about comments too much? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:33:51
It won't be stuck forever unless it has 0 sat/byte fee, otherwise it will get processed sooner or later :)
I always use  to find out what's happening with mempool, at the moment even 300 sat/byte transactions have to wait a bit
There are couple of measures to 'resend' - RBF (Replace-By-Fee) and CPFP (Child-Pays-For-Parent), but not too sure if there's an easy way to use them

@_date: 2018-03-27 23:37:10
If you try it again it should appear within 1-2 minutes :) There was a bug preventing it from working:)

u/cointippy gild BTC For some reason it didn't send "Not enough funds" message to you, but if you try tipping again it should work :)

Thanks for your feedback guys :)

Never done it, but here's how you can debug it:
1) Check if you can ping 192.168.178.21
2) Check if you can telnet into  192.168.178.21:8333
3) Check debug.log to see if your LAN node tells anything about 192.168.178.21

In other words, we need merchant adoption first, so that users are 'forced' to create / fund &amp; spend (not HODL!) crypto in their channels
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:18:49
You can also check CoinTippy, that allows to receive a tip on Reddit, and pass it on to Twitter/Twitch/Telegram user :)

Not sure why you need another bot, CoinTippy allows LN deposits since ~April :)

People were excited about CoinTippy too.. It's still operational, but it seems everyone wants to HODL, so no one even remembers it, although only half a year passed since we announced it :)

The problem with LN is not UI/UX, it's channel balancing. How users are supposed to receive anything through LN if they don't have funds on "remote" end of the channel?
