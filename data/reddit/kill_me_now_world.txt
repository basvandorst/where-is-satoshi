Someone tell me if this is worth 4 minutes of my life.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:13:53
Better now than later. I’d hate to see someone wait for a dip and then another 5k jump happens like the 10k-15k did over night.
30k by New Years.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:03:40
Only if you think coinbase is likely to get hacked. With pocket change it’s not worth the hassle.

? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:53:19
I think it will explode once it hits 20k... maybe all the way to 30k. The media will eat up 20k and more people will finally cave in and buy. who really knows though pfffft.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:07:51
And when is this “dip” happening?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:41:54
Same. That’s about all I know hah.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:07:16
I keep watching this just for the little girl going "wow" it's hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:05:41
how's liverpool?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:52:04
You can use PayPal or link a bank account to withdraw as well... is your account set up for that or...?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:37:23
25k by new years!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:27:05
I can help you out just pm me I'll walk you through it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:06:08
Maybe base your decision off more than one source...?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:55:18
10k by new year. 90k by nov 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:01:39
It's incredibly easy even though it might seem daunting at first. For starters, sign up at coinbase.com. There are other exchanges out there but coinbase is the biggest with the lowest transaction fees.
Let me know if you need any help past that.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:48:23
at 8,990!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:24:28
Not OP. What do you mean by fork? Go down or up? Or good time to buy vs bad time?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:21:02
Now how many new coinbase users can we attract from @_date: 2017-11-08 17:56:28
Buy buy buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:49:46
I was in this boat but am clearly in it for the long run now. Not sure why I didn't leave $50 in my wallet two years ago when it was at $300. I remember it going from $300 to $800 and thinking it was big.
I would hate to be thinking what would have happened if I bought at 7k two years from now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:54:30
Edit: RIP inbox
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:01:00
So basically gdax is guaranteeing access to b2x after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:48:34
I've put off getting in this for the long haul for so long. I remember two years ago seeing bitcoin jump from $300 to $800 and thinking it was huge. If only I bought then I'd have an extra 7k in my pocket today.
No matter how the market swings I'm it it for the long run now!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:26:44
Can someone clarify what this "fork" is for me?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:00:46
So basically gdax is guaranteeing access to b2x after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:59:37
It really is the future. Maybe future world-wide currency?

Thanks didn't know what to google.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:46:53
Ideally in my mind btc will replace every countries currency. Only commenting because it's been 7 hours and no one has said anything. Not to incredibly knowledgeable.
Buy now-&gt;hold forever and be rich
If it continues to grow exponentially (which I believe it will) then who knows what the exchange will be at by 2020.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:20:10
Good job you are successfully a Reddit douche.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:49:23
HODL 2030
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:27:40
It doesn’t make any sense to me either. You’d have to be an idiot to not buy all the bitcoin you can.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:42:18
At least 15k
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:03:48
buy buy buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:37:02
Why is it going up? This makes no sense. People are going to sell after hearing they won't get the b2x right?
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:57:37
fork is cancelled.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:30:28
The answer is always yes, buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:11:10
what the fuck is happening this is insane holy shit.

What's the point of transferring it into GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:43:11
Just bought some. No idea if I did the right thing or not. Also, are we selling of holding after the 16th?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:56:19
time will tell I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:37:42
Eventually the fork will need to happen though right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:52:34
10k by the new year for sure. possibly 15k early spring.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:36:20
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:38:45
Ah maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:39:55
You can encrypt your hard drive so only those with the hard key can reset the password.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:49:39
im just waiting for the explosion of memes
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:29:21
You have two options... 1) Keep telling your self it's to late and regret not buying earlier or 2) Buy now.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:58:56
I use coinbase as well but plan on switching to a local wallet once by funds get huge. Something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:40:31
How old are you? [Seriously]( That's what I'm fucking talking about. Are you trolling? This post is long past dead and your still making a case for what exactly? It's an added security measure that anyone with a brain would use in case their laptop get's stolen dimwit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:04:26
Do the math and ask yourself. If it’s at $100,000 by 2027 how much money will you have? Was it a good start ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:06
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:33:47
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:03:52
Day trading or HODLing? Which is more profitable?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:38:13
Check your security settings on your bank account. Exact same thing happened to me but ones I turned off 2fa coinbase was able to link up real smooth.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:00
It could swing either way though right? S2X could be worth less than dirt too?
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:38:11
It's gone up 9X this year alone. It's definitely going to be growing exponentially the more it is adopted/used by different companies. Looking forward to the day when Apple announces you can pay for your Starbucks with the bitcoin on your phone. Gonna sky rocket. Mark. My. Words.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:52
Encrypt your hard drive and turn on your firewall..
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:03:05
Thanks you probably just saved me some money.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:13:30
There is a reason coinbase is the biggest. I’ve been with them for three years without a hitch. If you are dissatisfied yeah there are other exchanges out there.
But, it sounds like you are more concerned about security? Just install electrum on your computer and send all your funds to that, encrypt your hard drive, use a firewall, don’t click on suspicious links, store your private key somewhere on paper, etc.
Only reason to not use coinbase is if you think they are likely to get hacked or crash.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:07
Coinbase is the biggest for a reason.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:56:07
No people regularly invest less than 1k everyday. Your return will be smaller. But ultimately in the long run (if you're a true believer) btc still has a long was to go.
Who knows what $20 in etc will look like in 5 years. It could be the standard world currency!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:28:38

I'm waiting for a big company like apple or amazon to announce they'll be accepting bitcoin out of the blue sometime this year. gonna sky rocket.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:26:08
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:38:53
Buy more?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:01:05
Whatever it takes to get to 100k by 2027
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:56:42
It's not uncommon for bitcoin to rise/fall some 15% in an hour. You'd have to watch it all day...
Which is fine I suppose I'd just rather spend my time doing something else.
You could fall asleep after selling at 7k only to wake up and it's at 8k.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:07:46
I expect to wake up to 10k tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:15:53
on amazon too
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:17:53
Unconfirmed is fine. As long as you see it you will get it. It takes a while for the blockchain to confirm transactions. If you are impatient try increasing the transaction fee next time. Transactions with higher fees get verified faster in the blockchain. You should see 1 confirmation within the hour and you’ll have full access to the funds after 3/4 confirmations.
That’s been my experience with electrum anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:05:10
who says it won't hit $500k?
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:36:07
My set up is coinbase with an electrum wallet but there are many different options.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:38:32
You have two options... 1) Keep telling your self it's to late and regret not buying earlier or 2) Buy now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:37:26
You can. Just buying and holding it though is a lot less stressful and you won't lose any money learning when to sell/buy and reading the peaks/dips.
Most people just buy and hold. Day traders goes through so much shit.
It's gone up 9X this year alone. Why bother with buying and selling when it's more profitable to buy bitcoin (and hold) than buying netflix stock?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:14:23
I’d be surprised if we don’t hit 10k by new year.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:33:31
It all seems daunting at first but it really is simple. PM me if you want  someone to walk you through it. I've been working with bitcoin for 3 years now. Not long I know but I'd like to think I know some things.
Start with creating an account at Coinbase.com. There are other exchanges out there but Coinbase is the biggest and has the lowest transaction fees. You get charged a very small amount (less than PayPal) anytime you convert USD to BTC.
Be prepared to take a selfie and a picture of your ID for them. Don't be alarmed it's all expected and secure.
Then buy bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:43:44
this is why you HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:54:16
Do it yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:41:34
