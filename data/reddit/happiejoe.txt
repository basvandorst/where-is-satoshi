Cryptsy's Gox'ing is like finding out your girlfriend is cheating on you but won't admit it -- the relationship is obviously coming to an end, but still dragging it out with all this bullshit.

This happened to me about 10 years ago in eBay. I was naive. I sold something on eBay and deposited the buyer's money order. I sent out the goods and the money order ended up being no good.

I'm not going to pretend that I do, because I don't. I'm obviously not understanding something. So please fill me in. 
If you do 12 years, how many more years until you retire?

Why wouldn't a mixer work? Like some serious ass mixing.

So work twenty years and you can retire? Sounds decent. But since this is r/Bitcoin, there is no guarantee that those benefits will last. If the monetary system crashes, military benefits might very well crash too.

The pattern: price go up, price go down.

I think Bitcoin will go up 50% then down 50% then up again and down again.

Your 12 years in, only a few more decades before you can retire. :/

I've use korbit. I think it's good. I've also used their API and I think it's fairly sophisticated.

It depends how the exchange handles their wallets.

Goes up or down




People will use other things as money. Maybe Litecoin.


Yes.

Fitch still hasn't said anything publicly about this positive PED test.

Cavirtex was died, so Coinsetter bought it to revive it. Coinsetter and Cavirtex were dying, so Kraken bought them both. The circle of life continues.
