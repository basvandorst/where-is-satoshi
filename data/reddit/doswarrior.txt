Don’t forget all the forks (BCH has value) that are on the coin as well. You should be getting that as part of the sale price too.

2FAs are generated by a seed, which is how you can generate the same code across multiple devices. The best solution is to write down the seed prior to confirming the 2FA. Once you have a paper backup, enter it manually into whatever 2FA solution you're using, generate a code, and confirm it. The ensures that you have a working paper backup, and also confirms you have a working OTP generator. For an extra level of security, laminate the paper backup, place it in a tamper proof bag, and store it in a fireproof/waterproof safe. If you do it this way you don't need to worry about EMP attacks, as paper is safe. Mobile OTP solutions are worse than hardware keys, as mobile has huge attack vectors, is always connected, and has to store the seed on the same device in order to generate the codes. If I hack it remotely, I can compromise the seed. It's better to store these types of things of offline hardware keys specally designed for this. This would be the paranoid level of security and backups, but always ensures you'll have access to your 2FAs.

If I hack your 1Password though (malware, keylogger), I've now compromised your passwords AND 2FAs. That defeats the purpose of a second factor, and stores all secrets in a single place. I'd advise separating these.

I'm wholly confused by this, but if you're looking to purchase bitcoin you either have to do it through an exchange, or in person through a local bitcoin trade. Any exchange you sign up with will vet you out and this takes a few days, so your best bet is to find a local trade. Regardless of what path you take you will not be able to buy 2 BTC for less than the market price.

As a computer security guy I would advise you to not disclose what type of wallet/backups you are using.  Even though the system may be branded "secure" or you think there are sufficient controls, an attacker can take this information and use it as a targeted vector.

Grats! It blew my mind as well when I saw how easy things were. You can tell people about bitcoin all day, but once they use it to buy something you see the light bulb go off in their head.

This is the worst idea I've ever heard.

I do, but I'm talking more about developing the attack methodology itself. If I wanted to social engineer or theoretically build an attack against you I now know what wallet you are using by your own admission. If that wasn't disclosed the wallet would be an unknown variable and I'd have more ground work to do to find an attack vector.

Thanks for doing this!

Hey buddy!
