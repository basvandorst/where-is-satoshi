Have you seen the graphs of the price doing this every year on this exact day and then bouncing back?

I don't even know! I cant get GDAX to load correctly and when it does it's so slow things one side of the page change and the other side is frozen.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:15
I am cashing out of GDAX for the day. Fuck this 10 second wait the process a buy or sell and the price having moved so far it's rejected.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:23:36
I now also can't cancel a limit order. It just keeps coming back.
EDIT: It never reached fill price either so i'm just stuck with an open order that I can't adjust.

Trade on gdax no fees if you set everything limit buy/sell. 0.25% fee if you do market buys/sells.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:34:16
Yeah I find that site easier to look at. Also bear in mind that 20 odd hour wait assumes a load more people don't pile in stacking up transactions so it could in theory take longer.

That's a lot of very technical questions. I'd recommend reading up on the technology a bit. Focus on bitcoin first. There's loads of simple videos on youtube that explain the tech and why it's good and why people are using it. 
Can you make money off of it? Yes, I see it as the same way you could have made money investing in coal mining technology several hundred years ago.
Go check out Coinbase for a beginner friendly crypto buying and selling website. 
In terms of spending money on it. Just like the stock market, don't invest in something you don't know about and don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Can I use Gemini from the UK? Am I allowed to deposit GBP or EUROs? Where are they based?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:55:19
I don't think you know what the word "safest" means lol. You're using it to mean "Most risky"
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:37:12
Whats happening on Dec 18th?
Also the safest bet regardless is to split the amount you were going to buy and get 50% before and 50% after.

Before anyone says anything I switched between Euro and USA right as it was dying so the graph is in USD and everything around the outside is in EURO. 
The crazy rise in the graph is what I was pointing out though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:39:53
I legitimately went to make a cup of tea and some crumpets and the price increased nearly 1000 euro. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:03:23
I paid a 9 sat fee to send $5 to a test wallet just to play around with this wallet and it's been 2 days without it confirming soooooooooooo I can't help you. I'm not expecting it to confirm unless the transactions in the memepool start getting cleared.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:24
There was a 4k price jump. I looked and then I looked back and this happened...
...And then it was dead.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:26:49
Mine never reached the fill price though so it's not like its gone through and isn't showing me yet. I'm just stuck selling and can't cancel.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:52
I brought my brother $45 of xmas crypto this morning and now it's worth $30 lol.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:45:33
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING!
I've been watching all day! Stay tuned for crazy swings!
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:52:00
What about people being able to buy it cheaper on other exchanges and jumping over to coinbase/gdax to sell as the price is so much higher?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:58:28
Did you call that based on some info or just because you saw it starting to go down?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:47:27
Wasn't that last week? Is this the bigger futures exchange that was coming after? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:46
Casual 5k price swing
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:58:43
Don't worry that it doesn't show on blockexplorer. One of mine isn't showing there either. Don't know why but it's not just you and it shows other places so its fine.
Look here: 
Based on the fee your blockchain.info link says was paid, you're in the queue, but there's a long wait. Between 4-124 blocks. At 6ish blocks per hour that's 20 odd hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:52
Most of it is frozen for me. It starts working again for about a minute after a refresh but not for very long.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:55:18
Satoshi dumping either one for the other would be huge!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:08
Selling opens 1 hour after the order book so 10am.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:35:45
Pay your taxes
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:53:15
I think the order book is up for an hour then trading will open at 6pm. So at 6pm something will be happening! I don't know what but it'll be something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:03
Will it though? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:52:52
Back up to +4 here. Your post is already out of date.

Coinbase now D.E.D DED. RIP buying the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:25
I just wanted to buy the dip!

I have the now old Electrum wallet where I keep my Bitcoin. Do I need to do anything? Does getting the new Electrum 3.0 change anything for me? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:55:54
I'm new. Am I understandig that there are different types of bitcoin wallets and that having one from coinbase is bad? Do I need to look up different types of bitcoin wallets before I decide which one to go with?
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:10:18
Russia just announced they are banning all mining and crypto. Could it be that?
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:13:59
As a noob. Why isnt a bigger block size better?
