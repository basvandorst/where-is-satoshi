Segwit adoption is 13.5%. Now is a great moment to send your BTC to a Segwit-compatible address.

PROS: being decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, open to innovation, fairly distributed money, with a capped supply, a mining hashpower and node distribution that can withstand attacks from colluding nation states, a clear monetary policy, 10 years of history and the biggest community in crypto.
CONS: slow, max TPS limit, pseudonymous (instead of anonymous).
You can have faster and scalable money easily if you accept centralization. Also, I think pseudonymity made BTC much more inclusive/popular and easier to scale than complete anonymity. Good trade-offs in my opinion.

That's a legacy BTC address (they start with 1). It is recommended to use Segwit addresses, as it benefits you (with lower tx fees) and the network (with higher tx capacity). Segwit adoption is currently at 40%.
Therefore, choosing a segwit-compatible wallet like Samourai (Android) is wise.

If you mean increasing volatility by pumping and dumping with the intent of delaying adoption of crypto, not a good attack vector.
Volatility is a natural phenomenon in small market cap cryptos. As adoption increases, volatility reduces. Which is exactly what is happening year after year in BTC. Also, the media loves the mania and crashes of the market. That is "free marketing", which helps to increase awareness and adoption eventually.
If States just buy, it would pump the price to Saturn's moons and we get a new global reserve currency.

It can allow the transfer of wealth from the productive non-violent (private) sector to the unproductive coercitive (state) sector of the population. You can finance literally anything (wars, concentration camps, nuclear bombardments, etc) with it just printing it at will. You obviously devalue it, but by forcing people to use your state-coin you generate demand for it. Because state-coins are centralized and uncapped, the population can NOT choose NOT to finance all that crap.
Regarding crypto scams, only you can say which distribution method is "fair": Mining, Airdrop, Captchas, ICO.  There is no "right" answer. However, if developers have a big share of the supply and there are inflation/governance benefits for them for having that (which redistributes wealth to them, like in STEEM, EOS, DASH) you could say it is kind of a scam. They are less scammy than state-coins because you are not forced to use them but that's setting a very low bar.

I meant BTC can not be inflated "at will" like state-coins. There is a 12.5 BTC block reward now, according to a defined schedule until max supply is reached.
12.5 x 6 x 24 = 1800 BTC per day, valued at 12 M USD now.

There is no way to control BTC the way Central Banks control state-coins. You can't censor transactions, double spend, inflate supply or force adoption in merchants. By taking monetary sovereignty back from the State you win, they lose.
Central Bankers could have bought a lot of BTC, sure. But that wouldn't give them "control" over you.

Everyone with significant capital can buy thousands of ASICs and run them in a country with cheap electricity. Google "chinese mining farms" and you'll see the facilities in youtube. That way they are competing for the 12.5 BTC + transaction fees block reward every 10 minutes like everyone else.
Every new block is in the public ledger and you can check the block reward. If miners wanted to give themselves more BTC per block, that block would be rejected by nodes.

In a POS consensus algorithm coin, if you had 51% of the supply, you could indeed "control" it.
BTC has a POW consensus. You would have to own all the mining pools to censor transactions. And if you wanted to double spend, you would have to own a lot of mining power to make a 51% attack possible.

Regarding BTC volatility decreasing over time:  
Big players play the crypto market like everyone else. But the higher market cap/adoption, the higher liquidity and the less volatility. So we should be getting more resilient every year, I think.
Rising BTC price (year to year) means someone (funds, institutions, States, regular people) is ditching other assets (state-coins and metals previously used as a store of value) for BTC. It's a side effect of adoption. Other ways to measure adoption: new users on exchanges, wallets downloaded, surveys, etc.

That may be true in the developed world. They are forgeting people living in countries with double digits anual inflation have lost faith in paper money decades ago. Banks in these countries are also extremely unreliable, so BTC is an obvious solution.

BTC is a limited supply coin, with a 21 million supply cap and 77,4% already mined. Considering coins were lost,  supply is further restricted. Demand for BTC is increasing (see number of transactions/day, trading volume, number of addresses on blockchain.info charts). That ensures you peace of mind concerning your wealth will not be significantly diluted by future mining. That makes BTC a great "buy and hold" coin. It's also the only coin with some commercial use and millions of users, granting it considerable network effect.
ETH doesn't have a supply cap. There are 90 million ETH now + 18 million more ETH per year. See [here]( and [here]( It was not made with the intention to be a store of value. ETH also lacks blockchain immutability: read about the DAO attack and the Ethereum Classic (ETC) fork. ETC does have a supply limit and blockchain immutability.
I wouldn't buy ETH or ETC now. If you think some coin is undervalued, buy it after doing considerable research. Also, be patient and don't buy at a peak.

No. Making the block size bigger increases max TPS, decreases transaction fees and, in the long term, pushes towards node centralization.
Transaction fees decrease immediatly because users don't need to compete with each other for block space anymore, as it has ceased to be a scarce resource. Unfortunately, this is a nice short term solution only. As more halvenings take place, new coins rewarded to miners become an increasingly small part of the total block reward and transaction fees become an increasingly big part of the block reward. If the total block reward is not enough, miners will exit the network and the coin is dead.

Fortunately Poloniex groups transactions. 144 users paying 0,1 mBTC each add up to a 14,4 mBTC Tx fee. They always seem to target a Tx fee worthy of next-block inclusion.

Central banks adopting some metal standard would still have counterparty risk for the users of that currency. Considering they already had our gold and stole it a century ago, they have proven not to be trustworthy to try that experiment again. 
So I don't see how that could delay crypto adoption, even if Russia and China establish a metal standard for their currencies. States/companies backing their national currencies/stablecoins with metal introduces a single point of failure in the system, making them more fragile than a decentralized alternative.
