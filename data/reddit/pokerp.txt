Ok, I don't see it, but no. Nothing like a pyramid scheme. Maybe because I did not explain or convey the idea correctly. New members are not allowed to make referrals. They must achieve a certain level within the club, a rank if you will, before they can make referrals. Obviously, anyone making a referral will earn from the rake generated by his referral.
Early adopters will be granted the rank so they may begin to make referrals immediately. Better?

BTW, last we had a look at SWC's and they pretty much want dna samples...
Edit 1; I may be very wrong about this, but I won't take this comment down so I can eat crow if I am...
Edit 2; I don't have a picture of me eating crow, but I'm sitting here with a mouthful of feathers... I have been humbled by this tongue blunder. My apologies to Seal With Clubs, I was mis-informed.
EDIT 3; Shit! I called them Seals With Crows! Fixed!

Please elaborate on how you figure this is a pyramid scheme? I saw it more like an affiliate system.

Hi bitesports, if you have an idea of where you think the rake should be at? We would be very interested in having an offline discussion about it.

I think we can debate anonymity until we're all blue in the face, but the fact remains that an email address does not make such a big difference to, let's say, your connection to any poker server where your ip address is openly available to anyone with access. I really see no difference unless you are using your personal email.
Also, keep in mind we're talking about a club and not a poker room open to the public. We do need something to contact members with. I think an email address is as non-intrusive as a club can get.
EDIT: Apparently, there are many words I can't spell
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:41:46
Ok, so you're saying we should not collect an email? This is also a possibility. How does collecting an email address affect anonymity when you can just create an email for just this use?
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:54:31
Can you explain producers?

This is always an issue when attempting to design software for this type of gaming. Although our client send only the information that may be viewed by the player to the client, it is very difficult to prove this. 
I will say that any funny stuff attempted in the past by any gaming house has always been discovered by the players, so it is now pretty much an open secret within the industry that the game needs to be random and no amount of coding will avoid being found out.
I do believe it is the decisions taken by the room at the time of problems that make or break the site. Here's hoping we continue on the same path.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:49:22
This is exactly what we've implemented and are testing at the moment! I would have thought this was elementary. I guess not.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:41:28
This keeps coming up and it is true, it is rather disconcerting. But we seem to think that if you use Bitcoins to buy USD, then we cash you out only in USD. If you just buy Bitcoins to play at the BTC tables, then you get Bitcoins back. This way, we stay far away from becoming an exchange house.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:40:21
There is a reason I have not mentioned the site name and will not. I am currently trusting in our marketing efforts and the clients we're winning even if one by one.
You may well already have heard of the site, or not. But you will doubtfully learn it from this posting.
EDIT: but you will play at our site one day, I promise... :-)
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:51:33
Yes, players have a choice to purchase the USD using Bitcoins or just deposit Bitcoins to play at the Bitcoin tables. Unfortunately, and in order to keep some level of sanity, the decision made at the time of purchase is final and no exchanges will be allowed from there on out. Unless we can come up with some way of ensuring exchange rate satisfaction.

Hi David, here's a few pointers, geoip from maxmind. Though never spend money just to get Twitter followers, followers, signups, players playing with your money rarely put up their own to play. Your promotions for bankroll building should lead the players into wanting to risk their own money.
Would love to compare notes sometimes.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:53:09
One of our payment providers is looking into allowing the sale of Bitcoins using a credit card. If they pull this off, it could be very interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:38:46
Yes, was looking through this and found some people who will sell Bitcoins in Madrid. You have to meet them in a cafe. Reminded me of those movies where people meet in a bar to exchange drugs/information/etc.
Kinda spooky if you ask me. Especially for a bitcoin noob.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:58:16
Yes, we are most definitely programmed to avoid what we mostly now consider noise. Thank banner advertising for that :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:32:00
Thanks Riplin!
1. Will definitely look into BIP32
2. TOR sounds interesting for security reasons
3. Tables are USD, there will be BTC tables. The exchange from Bitcoins to dollars can only be done at the time of purchase, withdrawl through bitcoin from USD dollars will have to be done on an agreed upon exchange rate, though we would prefer to stay away from this.
4. Gonna need more clarification on this
5. Hmm, this looks like something we'll definitely be considering
6. Unfortunately, payout requests will always have to be management approved, too many fraud risks involved in automatic approvals.
It is awesome that you took the time to give us you thoughts, thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:45:14
Yes, very dangerous indeed. But, one thing I have learned in this industry is that, 98% of the people on this planet are honest, basically, only 2% of credit card transactions are ever charged back in gaming as a general rule. So let's say that VIP players can easily purchase Bitcoins with their credit cards, and noobs must dance to the tune of wires until they become VIP?
Something along those lines until we have more time to study the numbers. But I can most certainly see it as a possibility.
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:17:14
Nope, sorry, not one of those big guys.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:45:38
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:55:45
Exactly this we're working on. An easier way to buy Bitcoins immediately. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:18:50
Well, frowned upon by the various acquiring institutions they may use. I said that in thinking about that credit institution in the US that was welcoming Bitcoin merchants one day, then a few days later, announced the mass closure of accounts due to regulatory issues.
I will try them again tomorrow.

Hi grabberfish, getting people to play at a poker room is a huge and expensive endeavor. A room first has to overcome the "look, a startup!" giggles, then the doubters, not to mention those who will never remember that Party Poker was at one point, a startup as well.
Now multiply all that by the number of skins you mentioned and you wind up with a series of sites you can never get off the ground.
On another note, if you look at a site like Party Poker, they began selling skins. Remember the Empire Poker ordeal? When they got too big for their britches, they cancelled all affiliate contracts and skins and then went public. The point being that a single poker site will always gain in value, but a networked site will always be just a network site.
So to answer your question, no, we will be treating Bitcoin as just another valuable currency we'd certainly like to accept.
Obviously, we are keen to listen which is the reason for this post in the first place, and will not hesitate to change our minds on any issue that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:19:33
Thanks for this. But what makes you think that a fast exchange would make the bitcoin price higher? I have been working for years in the credit card processing industry, with high risk merchants. And from talking to banks we deal with, it doesn't seem like a real long shot to get credit card processing for an account that would allow for the eventual purchase of bitcoins. (Think Virwox)
Obviously, this would have to be done using 3D secure for Mastercard, or Securepay from Visa, and the transactions would have to be limited for new users, but it seems certainly viable.
The problem seems to be in the large amounts of volume that a site like this promises to generate, and large volumes tags any site not called Amazon or Ebay. Somehow when you do large volumes you are automatically termed a money launderer until proven otherwise.
If anyone thinks this should be in a separate thread, mods?, please let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:43:13
We're thinking of using Blockchain to get started and to test the waters.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:53:53
Sorry guys. And you're right. I did not, of course, read the side bar. But looking through it now, it is a smorgasbord of stuff, hard to find info.
If someone can provide some links to look up information like this, it would really be helpful.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:23:31
Awesome! I am going to try and do a upfront and personal purchase this week. I will post the resulting adventure when I have done so. Thanks for the update!
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:45:15
I went to virwox too and saw that I could buy SLL's. But there is no mention that you can quickly convert them into Bitcoins. Though they may be using this as a way to provide this service, but then, why not just come out and say it?
I did not deposit because I was scared that this may be frowned upon. They use Liqpay too and this may not be as condoned by Liqpay once they find out about this particular aspect or loop?
IOW, it is possible to purchase SLL's and them exchange them for Bitcoins, but this may not last. Then whoever gets caught in the middle may just be stuck with SLL's.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:48:08
So let's say I am going to do this. I bring my phone and have them transfer the Bitcoins to my wallet. Does this happen immediately? I don't want to get there and look like an idiot, which I am on bitcoin matters. LOL.
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:43:52
Hi, I may have made a confusing statement somewhere. But we are not planning multi currency tables. We are planning on having bitcoin tables and USD tables. If you have a dollar balance, you can play at a USD table. Bitcoin balance? You can play at Bitcoin tables. You made deposit only in USD? No bitcoin tables for you. Bitcoin deposit? No USD tables for you unless you explicitly chose during your deposit to convert immediately to your USD account.
Am I missing anything here?
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:54:56
I think having both currencies to choose from at the tables will prove more difficult in the beginning, but will definitely grow into something very useful.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:51:50
We will be offering both.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:37:22
This is exactly my point. I have to wire to a bank account in order to be able to buy Bitcoins. How is this helpful to people who are attempting to get into Bitcoins when the entry barrier is so difficult?
It is most certainly not a convenient currency to use. At least not from my angle.
@_date: 2013-11-02 05:19:50
Here, have an upboat!
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:16:27
Our players have access to the full history of their hands in the player section. All the statistical studies can be done from there. As far as the server not knowing about who gets what cards, that is sorta hard to do since winners have to be announced and histories have to be kept for precisely those reasons.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:33:10
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:48:07
In order to reach our deposit page, we must have the full signup completed. No paperwork, just information that will allow us to identify the player. Obviously we're thinking we can use Bitcoins to pay players we know regardless of their deposit method used. We do not charge for payouts into the US though and hope to keep it that way as long as the withdrawals are kept under a reasonable threshold.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:56:57
Ok, so this begs the question, where is it possible to get a real bitcoin market price? This would assume that the price being asked can be relatively easy to convert into currency. It just seems that it is extremely difficult to transact in bitcoins without very high risks.
