the "Overwhelming scientific consensus" will shift repidly in the coming years, keep your ears and eyes open :D

this is like a whole new level of retardation

but who will mine when BCH halvening happens a few weeks/months before BTC? at the time of writing BCH is at block 482338 and BTC 481902, thats 436 blocks, 1 day should be roughly 144 blocks so BCH is already almost 4 days ahead! (3.8)
for someone to start mining after that the difficulty must go so low that the chain could 'easily' be attacked
EDA is too easy to game.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:52:47
since when can you trust BTCDrak? lol
provide proof or gtfo with accusations
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:44:29
Cryptsy probably did that, go ask em how it went
oh snap
And peoples remember: If you don't control the private keys its not your BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:34:33
it should never have turned into "buy a coffee everyday using a decentralized currency that stores all transactions forever - for free" in the first place.
@_date: 2016-12-20 14:50:59
you cant?
I can. It makes perfect sense.
Also it has nothing to do with the US, its happening worldwide - you will see it in your home country soon too :)
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:37:03




what kind of sick joke is this? 
Looks more like dreams than reality.
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:58:08
no its not.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:40:28
did it once and about to do it again for parity "bug/hack" :D
then again
and again...
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:36:30
haha probably because the money in exchange didnt match up so now force everyone to verify even if they didnt need to before
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:37:55
especially exchanges like bittrex and poloniex, theyre both shady as hell.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:35:29
well it is bittrex after all, theyre known for being shady and customers accounts being locked indefinitely, 
very much similar to how mtgox / cryptys was before they disappeared.

Paying back 100% of the bitcoins at 30% valuation, hurray? Why are We supposed to be happy about this?
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:37:43
haven't see that one for awhile now :D
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:17:25
Paying back 100% of the Bfx tokens at 30% valuation, hurray? Why are We supposed to be happy about this?
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:19:50
fucking disgusting title
"100 percent in full"
you forgot at 20% valuation you herp derp tard
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:09:38
because Sam Cole is still full of shit
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:25:52
because its not the first time "china bans bitcoin".
believe it if you want, I dont.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:49:16
So an unsuccessful attempt at recreating Auroracoin + iceland? :D
that shit was hilarious, can't believe how many plebs fell for the obvious scam.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:17:10
no surprise
bittrex have been caught stealing customer funds before, this would not be a first.
Move "your" funds people! Bittrex cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:20:38


isn't democracy just great? :D
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:40:29
And thats why we need bigger blocks!!
am I doing this right?
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:34:32
well, if anyone knows how to create a useless tokens for trading its Bitfinex for sure.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:37:38
also 
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:13:03
I know right? Isn't it pretty awesome how he gets to order illegal things online and not get prosecuted for it because he's a politician meanwhile if someone like you did the same you'd spend 5-10 years in prison?
pretty damn awesome indeed
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:00:41
youre trolling, right?
or do you just sit and spew out shit you have clearly have no idea how it works?
**YOU** cant use ASICBOOST, its only for bitmain, on paper the other 'chips' (ASICs) are just as good.
you'd be retarded for buying a bitmain miner with hidden ASICBOOSt that **you cannot use**.

@_date: 2017-05-08 07:15:25
they hate Bitcoin, they love "blockchains"
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:14:23


Fixed it for you :D
