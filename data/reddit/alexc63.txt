We can choose to make certain transactions public (versus private) and thus allow the sender to show who the receiver was, which makes it evidence that is admissible in court.

Guys, there's some critical information that you're missing which is based on historical data. It goes along the lines of: in the 1960's-1970's a person could buy a home that was worth 1.5 years salary. Now it would take them 10+ years worth of salary. That's rampant inflation for you.

Without Mortgages we wouldn't have $500,000 price tags on homes. The prices of homes can be sky high right now because this is all Bank Money. It's nearly all leveraged money.

Either the high transaction fees of Bitcoin need to come down to well under $0.01 (highly unlikely), or Bitcoin will remain the 'Gold' of the crypto world, while many of the other faster, nearly fee-less cryptos will be used for daily transactions. In its current form, I could not see myself using Bitcoin daily for these exact reasons (too slow and high fees). For large business transactions, it may suffice. It makes more sense for Bitcoin to remain a store of value and for other cryptos to fill-in the niches that society demands, such as nearly instant transactions and nearly fee-less.

Why not LocalCoinSwap? I've been following them and even bought their tokens as an investor. They have an all around dedicated team and a community that votes constantly for improvements. They are owned by the community, not 1 rich guy like every other exchange listed in this Reddit post.
