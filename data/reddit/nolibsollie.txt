What if Coinbase is suspicious of the amount of bitcoin you are moving?
They might seize your account until you prove your innocence.
This could be troublesome.

Well y'know … bitcoin.
You must be new here.

Is this situation salvageable?

The government didn't smash planes into buildings. The government is composed of thousands of people.
A rogue faction pulled this off.
As for your question, we will have to ask the perpetrators to get the bona fide answer. I personally think it was done for shock and awe.
When everyone was in shock and awe, they inserted the message … Al Qaeda did it. Kind of a psy-op … or as Sean Stone said, "9-11 was basically a magic trick."  Oh look what happened! (don't watch my hands).

It's a slippery slope.
Next they will be banning sites with inconvenient opinions.
Thought crimes.

It has taken me weeks of reading in my spare time to get a grip on Bitcoin.

So bitcoin will be illegal in the US eh?
And if it flourishes in the rest of the world ... the US misses out and paints itself into a corner economically.
I doubt it.

Some journalists do not understand the bitcoin concept.

If people do not understand something they should ask questions.
NOT make assumptions.

The answer lies at your own doorstep.

So just to be clear, this tax is on canadian dollars made on cashing out bitcoins no?
If I buy 55 bitcoins save 50 and donate the other 5 I do not owe any of taxes right?
What if I buy a motherboard from the bitcoin store, am I supposed to pay some sales tax?

I'm holding, no problem here.

I hope that the original Bitcoin will be the high watermark of quality and TRUSTWORTHINESS.
For the people, by the people.
