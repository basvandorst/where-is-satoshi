Litecoin is fairly similar to Bitcoin.  It has the lightning network implemented, but also has a significantly lower network effect, and thus lower value than Bitcoin.  (There are people who would staunchly disagree with me and advocate for it though, recommend reading their subreddit to get a sense of what those arguments might be.)
Ethereum is very different from both BTC and LTC.  Ethereum is not trying to be the ultimate store of value like BTC.
Ethereum is different than Bitcoin in that it allows for smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf.
There are many people who are incredibly bullish on the platform potential of ETH.  There are a number of applications that currently act as a third party to connect you with others based on some set logic (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, eBay). Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum.

There is absolutely no way you can know what the motivations are of collective buyers right now.  While what you say can be true, it can also be true that people just think BTC was undervalued at 13-14k.

I really don’t know why you’re so upset about this but w/e.

Definitely a more profitable use of computing power than BTC.

This is a podcast that’s supposed to be approachable by anyone.  He’s just trying to bridge the gap for non-technicals.

Completely agree.  I loved Nicks thoughts and context, I just don’t see a reason to be mad at a guy who’s trying to bridge the gap for a subject that’s really hard and requires a bunch of thoughtful analogies to help people really understand.

You’re ignoring my point completely.  If the point is to cater to a wider audience that’s unfamiliar with crypto, then the intention of Naval “interrupting” is to help ensure more non-technicals understand Nick Szabo.
