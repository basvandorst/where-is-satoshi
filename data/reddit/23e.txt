Yeah, someone pointed that out, that's what I was looking for.
Also, a (better imo) alternative:

That's definitely a good method :) I view my music as a promotional commoddity, not something to make a lot of money off of (any musicin will tell you the money is in touring). 
I have both free and non-free releases (anthough my first non-free release isnt out til july), and there is an advantag to non free releases- that is if they are put on somewhere with high visibility.  For me, that is beatport. If I can get people to buy my stuff on beatport, then I will make the top 100 charts, which exposes my music to DJs all over the place, and also alows me to play more shows by listing that as an accomplishment.
I have a fulltime job that makes my money :P

I'm by no means big, but I'm on a record label with digital distribution. My main releases would be out there for regular money (on itunes, beatport, and a bunch of other stores), I figured I could put them on bitcoin as well perhaps for a bit less, also just to get people to think "What is this bitcoin option?"  On top of that I was thinking of maybe doing one or two bitcoin-exclusive tracks.
Tracks dont really make that much income, and I don't care about how much I make.  Also since the bitcoin tracks are less accessible they'd build more hype :P (I'd have audio previews up for them)

Ooh! This is EXACTLY the kind of thing I was looking for. Beautiful. You are a rockstar.
Edit: Hmm, it's great for super anonymous stuff since you dont get an account, but the whole 7 day expiration thing is kinda lame :/

potentially :) I know how to set it up to send people to pay with mybitcoin, but how do you keep the downloads prievate/how do you serve it to customer?
I was Gonna use   but there's commission rates and whatnot.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:14:39
true actually.  Do you have it automatically email them or something? Or does it just redirect to that page?
@_date: 2011-06-17 16:08:39
Are you planning on expanding this at all to allow other artists? I was looking for something similar about a week ago:

While your point, in general, is correct(ish), I found some pretty funny irony:




That is even more difficult than what I'm asking to do, for a number of reasons that I'll list later if you really want me to.
Regardless, there is a market of people who do pay for music, especially from people who are more independent and/or if the money is more likely to go to them.  That's what the Bandcamp website is all about.  I hardly expect to make a large sum of money off my tracks, but rather I want to help stimulate the bitcoin economy and give people a reason to adopt it. Because regardless of how much you think the value of a track is, it is a sellable commodity. 
On top of that, with bitcoin exclusive tracks, the chance of piracy is reduced, because those who buy it are usually interested in getting bitcoin to succeed. Because they want bitcoin to work, they (hopefully) wouldn't pirate the music as to hope others buy it.  Regardless, piraccy will happen on any platform, and I expect it.
