That thing is very very very cool!!! 
But for most of us it would be easier and cheaper to take any old laptop or computer we have laying around and build a node. 
I use a 5 year old Mac Mini. It’s got way more compute, memory and disk than it needs to do the job and a nice interface to boot. 
So folks, don’t let your lack of Pi stop you.

Charts aren’t everything and they are often worse than nothing when dealing with a new asset class over the long term. (Meaning anything over a couple days lol.)
This is because all the technical  analysis on earth will get trampled/invalidated by a single piece of news good or bad. 
It’s also because the future is inherently unpredictable and anyone who tells you they *can* predict it using a chart depicting data from the past is full of sh*t and probably angling for a fat commission to be earned off your naïveté. 
The beliefs of human beings about the utility of a given offering related to it’s actual utility as it’s proven or disproven over time are the only factors that give a value or long term success to a product, business, or idea. 
Charts on exchanges are supposed to be depictions of the strength of that belief and of the proof thereof not guides on what to believe. 
Success is a feedback loop, a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy jump started by strong belief and sustained by accrued benefits (or allowed to die from their absence). 
Anyway,,,, blah blah blah XD.

Yes a trade is free on GDAX if you’re a ‘market maker’ so you can keep your fees low if you play it that way mostly. But the other piece is taxes. ��
If you trade back and forth and actually make money (as far as I understand it, I’m not a tax person or financial advisor) you will owe short term capital gains tax *on every trade*.  STCG is set to your income tax bracket so likely 25-40% of your profit is gone right away. 
If you keep the bitcoin over a year then sell, you will pay long term capital gains at 15%. 
If you do pay trading fees, take that off the top. 
So you either need a lot of volatility (which $BTC does have in spades) or a lot of money in the game to make much at day trading. You need a metric ton of skill and luck either way. 
If I’m wrong on any of this people, please comment and correct me... I’m just guy who read some articles      .

There will be hubs that arise because of better connectivity, resources, or location in the network graph but as long as the hubs are temporary, easily interchangeable and the data is encrypted, a central hub has no additional leverage over the network afaik.

Get a wallet that lets you choose your fees like blockchain. Then if you don’t care that it takes a while, set your fee low. It often doesn’t take any longer in my experience. 
 has mentioned this problem of fee inflation due to oversimplified mobile wallets choosing higher fees and causing a ‘fee escalation race’.

If you all want some bitcoin donated then here's an easy way to get some. Spend 7-8 years of your life:
* building BTC apps such as wallets and blockchain explorers
* be an expert author and speaker on the subject (write at least 2 books about it)
* travel the world teaching about bitcoin often for free
* regularly *give your own bitcoin away* to interested people just to help them get started
* care about all the people of the world who bitcoin can help live better lives
* Post &gt;100 high-quality YouTube videos of your lectures that $BTC fans can refer newbie friends &amp; relatives to
* Help increase public awareness of $BTC to the point where much of the wealth hodlers now enjoy is a result of your hard work
**WHY** would you do all this? 
Because you have a plan to *'get rich quick'* by having a bunch of 'coin donated to you at the end? 
No No No! 
You'd do it because you are ** one of the *most awesome* people on Earth at the moment. 
 
If, like me, you're not a bitcoin millionaire yet but have a few smarmy $USD to spare, support Andreas on Patreon: 
(Those $USD will be worth a lot less tomorrow so, you might as well spend them today XD!)

You can get a lightning node running in AWS digital ocean, or linode in a few hours if you have basic Linux admin experience. 
They have simple instructions on github. Go for it!
I stood one up on a t2.medium instance in AWS which should only cost about $30/month to run. 
Lightning uses the Bitcoin testnet chain which is only 7-10 GB so storage isn’t too spendy. 
Seems like what’s needed also is more miners for  the $BTC testnet chain. It’s kinda slow in finding blocks. So if you have an old Antminer around and want to help, spin it up on testnet! (The hashing difficulty is quite low on testnet so old gear would work afaik. )
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:43:00
Awesome! That is exactly what the community needs. 
I’m a network/systems guy and stood up a node this week for the same reason. 
I’m not exactly sure what or how to test anything significant yet but once the learning curve flattens out that will hopefully become apparent.

The mobile wallets suck is why. They default to ‘high priority’ to make transactions seem efficient, fun, easy. Simplifying the user experience has trumped common sense. 
Most people who are new or never really learned about fees never even realize **you can choose your goddamn fees!!!**

So true! We need to start freaking using it for something. I bought a game on Steam with it a couple days ago, paid a friend back, and donated to my fave podcast (the black tapes... awesome!). ‘Me too Microsoft’ also accepts it on their live site for Xbox and other software. 
IMHO the stupid ‘bitcoin pizza’ legend is making everyone afraid to spend and then feel dumb later but, that’s why deflationary currency is not a 102.254% wonderful thing (see what I did there? ;-D )
If your money generally goes up in value, there’s a very strong incentive to save but too much saving destroys the economy as a whole. If you spend bitcoin then you are helping someone else get a little wealth too. 
So, be brave, put your big boy pants on and use the goddamn amazing currency we’re building!

He was at least somewhat political (or you could say simply ethical and fair-minded)  because the genesis block contains a reference to the 2nd British bank bailout using taxpayer (working class) money to save the rich from their own greed the resulting  mistakes. Crony capitalism at it’s worst. 
This is certainly a concise commentary on the meaning of bitcoin. 
Engineers in my experience are unusually rational and fair-minded, they like stability and even distribution. Traders and finance people far less so, they seem to prefer volatility and winner-takes-all scenarios. 
So, if the project is to fulfill any kind of egalitarian objectives, we need to keep the money people from overtaking it (51% attack lol) completely. They def. have a role to play in popularizing and marketing the currency but should be kept out of determining $BTC’s fundamental direction if possible. 
(IMHO This is why proof-of-stake currencies are doomed to rapid takeover by elites/cartels/cabals followed quickly by irrelevance.)

It’s funny how he and others complain about  electricity use. As if the major banks and retailers don’t use 1000x the KWH BTC uses to run their servers and networks. 
I’d bet in the long run BTC will be more efficient than they are. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:28:07
You better be working with a LOT of money to make those little moves pay. You’re going to get your profits eaten by fees and small mistakes otherwise. (Believe me I’ve done it). 
The problem with timing the market is that there are ‘whales’ (people who own HUGE amounts of coin that can change the direction) out there and we don’t know what they are going to do next.
They keep it a secret and some of them work together to manipulate the price. This is theoretically illegal (wink wink) in the normal stock market but crypto is the Wild West and the land of ‘caveat emptor’. 
As a mere mortal, IF you believe in BTC’s premise and are not just a speculator/get-rich-quick/carpetbagger type, buy it and HODL. 
Give BTC 5/10/20 years to pay you back in spades while being mentally ready to lose everything at any time (if the governments of the world decide BTC too beautiful, democratic, and free to live). 
Try running a full node on a spare computer or spin one up in the cloud to help the network and thus yourself. 
Do some work and get paid in BTC. 
Pay a friend back in BTC. 
Give BTC as a gift. 
Donate to a charity, podcast, or content creator in BTC. 
BTC is meant to be USED not just traded back-and-forth for obsolete fiat.

If your economy runs almost entirely on massive private sector leverage and debt like the US deflation is a death sentence! 
Deflation is bad for the government and the very rich who carry a lot of debt in their businesses because it makes it harder to pay off massive loans. 
For a normal person who saves money for emergencies/retirement and spends the rest to live, deflation can be helpful. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:38:56
I’ve got the same problem. Now might be the time to start buying on margin for those of us who believe in bitcoin but missed the super cheap days.
Kraken and bitfinex allow leveraged trades. Be careful though! Do lots of reading first! 
Don’t try to short, open long positions and hold them, don’t panic sell. Shorting is for gamblers or true pros and bitcoins going up anyway. 
One advantage of having an small amount to start with are your losses are automagically limited. 
Also, don’t just trade, set up a full BTC node or a lightning node, support the network!

Imho BTC is destined to become the world reserve currency replacing the USD at some point 10-50 years down the road. So the games are only going to get bigger and whether or not you can buy a cup of coffee with $BTC ‘on the chain’ is going to seem laughably small-minded and irrelevant when trillions of ‘USD’ (which will also seem small minded and irrelevant by then) worth of $BTC will be flowing around the planet daily. 
We will buy our coffee with freaking ‘coffeecoin’ or some such nonsense maybe, who cares?
The good thing about this is that it will break any one country’s control over the world economy in favor of a system no one controls, and everyone does.

I saw a ‘selfie video’ ad he made wandering aimlessly around a casino in Las Vegas. (Pretending to be a high roller I’m guessing.) 
Made all the douchebag, con-artist, scammer hairs on my head stand up. 
Sadly, nature or nurture has not blessed everyone with those wonderfully useful hairs and terrified by the hot flames of FOMO, they run like buffalo off the cliff. 
The guy’s using what for filming, a selfie stick? Does he keep it in the Lambo’s glovebox? He’s got his nerd glasses on and his hipster beard yet he misses the irony that nerds &amp; hipsters hate both Las Vegas and Lambos (as does anyone with a functioning brain.)

That would be an interesting attack on bitcoin for an entity with huge resources. Buy it up and then burn the keys so it can’t be recovered (kinda like with cocaine except there ‘keys’ means something diff lol). I guess though since BTC is so divisible,  you’d need to get ALL of it, or you’d just make the remainder insanely rich!
