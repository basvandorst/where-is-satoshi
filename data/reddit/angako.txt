i also love the tentacle... i mean bitcoin &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:26:50
its not about the computer but the internet connection :P some places have insanely expensive internet with extreamly slow speeds cause the telcom companys have a monopoly
@_date: 2013-04-06 13:13:16
its value doesn't stand a risk of hitting 0 XD

i say we should pool our resources into a super computer capable to replacing government completely, into a hard programmed corruption free system,might takes a few year like 20-30+ but MUCH more bank for your buck just hoping it doesent turn into a skynet XD

the whole point of bitcoins is that it is peer to peer and decentralized as long as people remember this fedcoins got no chance vs bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:06:32
i got 8 bit coins by mining alt currency and trading it for bitcoins back when it was worth $100 like a week ago, XD so ya im happy. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:42:20
think it might be better to just note that you will accept bit coins with the rate its moving atm you will need to update it every hour or so XD
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:15:33
plain and simply, its a scam, the product you get at the end or if ever will be almost useless, and will probably burn out in days.
@_date: 2013-06-08 09:49:42
i say scam the legal issues to get nation wide coverage is hard enough, since you HAVE to use existing networks,plus even if they got that sorted out being anonymous is almost impossible since you will be using other companys networks.
they will still be able to track you and will have your call logs, not to mention the courts can and will force you to release the data even if you you don't want too if they have a warrant even with out PRISM

dammit was about to submit this &gt;_&lt;

i think the main reason bitcoins growth has been slow(relative to last week) is because of the dos attack on mtgox we are near the level where it happened last time so it might happen again.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:37:31
thanx for reply guess we can ignore this for a while just think we need to iron out all the technical problems before they affect the value of bitcoins from over blown media responses the more we talk about the problems here the earlyer it can be fixed...probably
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:46:34
the way i see this is this is purely a technical problem that WILL get fixed when bitcoin goes further main stream, better companys will start taking initiative with more user friendly system and the companys that are hard to use will fall into obscurity,
Atm even if it doesnt look like it we are still working VERY close to the core way bit coins move threw the internet eventually we will probably get cards similar to credit cards to use anywhere or just your cellphone while still being fully secure, but the back bone transfer systems that we mostly use atm will still be here for those who can use it they will benefit much more from it.

looks like its time to swap my altcoins for bitcoins before the next bubble:P
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:06:40
im a bit scared about goverment geting there hands on bitcoins in a easy way like this eg: stock piles it till they got 51% or so then use it to fuck up the markets by mass selling all there coins in 1 go causing a mass crash in conjunction with media propaganda too destroy bitcoins image permantly... @_@
@_date: 2013-09-07 12:28:43
thanx for this really need some spair bitcoins my worker adderess is :
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:23:42
think it will be fastest to contact someone that actually owns a pool in the coin you wanna run
@_date: 2013-07-20 17:42:28
the internet archives own a bank and apparently they are very bitcoin friendly
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:08:37
profiting with a normal pc from mining is still viable IF you don't mine bitcoins XD, just try and find out what new alt coins will start when and mine the shit out of it on release day.
then just wait a week or 2 and an exchange will allow you to trade for bitcoins.
