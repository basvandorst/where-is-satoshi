Yes it is still spam, unless you can mention 1 useful/legitimate reason anyone would sign such a transaction.
We are all sharing a limited resource, and the few bytes used up by this transaction could have been used for a more useful transaction (at least moving coin to another address and not just looping back on itself)
Paying a high fee doesn't make the transaction useful or not spammy, it just tells us that whoever signed this is ok with wasting blockchain resources &amp; feeding the miners.
Only the miners benifit but with close to 300k pending transactions I think they'll still do ok without such transactions.

Fees it bitcoin have nothing to do with the amount you want to transact in, the size of the transaction dictates how much the fee will be.
A basic 2 input 2 output transaction of 1 btc will cost the same as a basic 2 input 2 output transaction of a 1000 btc.
If you are being quoted such a high price for a transaction fee you most probably are sending a transaction with a lot of inputs. i.e you are sending from an address which has recieved a lot of "small" transactions.
Does the wallet show you the size of the transaction ? (in bytes or kb)

What site can I visit to see those charts please?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:33
Definitely don't think it's worth the hassle anyway tbh

Miners will on average make the exact amount of money mining either chain.
Since mining is identical on both BTC and BCH there are pools which will automatically mine the most profitable pool.
Remember difficulty in BCH is much lower than BTC so even though BCH price is lower, there is a much higher probability in finding a block in BCH than BTC.
You can see which is more profitable to mine at any time by visiting  as of writing this BCH is 12% more profitable to mine than BCH.
Also remember that while BTC adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks), BCH updated difficulty every block.

the only reason I can think of, where it could possibly make sense to send bitcoin to the same address would be if the transaction is grouping multiple unspent outputs in a single output, so the next time you transact the transaction is smaller. 
Doesn't apply in this case, as it's one output back in the same address.
I wouldn't do this when transaction fees are this high anyway.

By the way, have a look at the statement made above by u/hitforhelp explains a possible reason why someone would send such a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:38:53
you can split 1 bitcoin into 100000000 satoshi 
0.00000001 BTC =  1 statoshi 
quote the price in statoshi and you won't see big numbers :)

This could explain it, was not aware of any of this with UnitedBitcoin.
Thanks

Thank you

You are correct in your first statement, no one expects you or anyone else to get permission from anyone, especially in crypto. :) But this is a public forum and we're all allowed to discuss no?
And yes, it could have been an honest mistake, someone pasted own address by mistake. 
We'll never know :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:04:23
why would you send BTC from 1 address to the same address??
Just felt like throwing 0.00569009 BTC away as fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:17
Can you please explain this further? I may not be understanding it correctly.
To recap, the transaction I posted is a transaction from address A to address A.
To send coin from address A to address A you need to have a balance on that address already i.e it was already an active address otherwise this transaction wouldn't even be possible in the first place.
What am I missing?

This site will estimate how long it would take a transaction to be included in a block based on the transaction fee and the current state of the network
