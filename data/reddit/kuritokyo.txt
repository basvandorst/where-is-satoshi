Actually, automatically tags new accounts with how old they are. I'm guessing it's to give less weight to a newbie's comment. 
Why don't you use your older accounts to comment? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:01:46
It seems you're too long in the tooth to need a tag. What would you like me to tag you as? What's your claim to fame so to speak? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:57:27
I feel does it to help balance out the debates that rage in here. When it says someone is a Redditor for only 6 days, you're not going to take what they say seriously.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:13:28
??? You've been here for a day.
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:26:05
So, this is possible? Great! 
I really see the potential for buying big ticket items overseas with it, but I thought it was still dangerous territory. 
How do you know to trust someone with such a big purchase? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:37:24
It's great to have ground breakers like this but I wouldn't want to be them. 
Even with 1st world countries, they can and do change the their standing with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:22:35
I agree.
Buy now, wait until you need it and hopefully by then you can use it everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:04:50
Are you saying it hasn't flattened out yet?
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:55:21
Excuse my ignorance, but what do Russians do? I've only come across them in Russia &amp; Thailand, &amp; Thailand's currency isn't tanking. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:35:17
Price it in Yen or don't price it at all. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:47:47
Exactly. 
As soon as people start using it as money, the value will become irrelevant. We don't decide where to go on holiday because their currency tanked. We go because we want to go. 
As soon as people decide Bitcoin is the currency they want to use, the price becomes irrelevant.
Use it like it's money and not like an investment.

I am still definitely a beginner and have no idea what it's like buying Bitcoin in other countries, but here in Japan, there's no delay. I just have trouble finding places to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:47:06
Is there really a big bitcoin scene in Tokyo? According to Yelp, there are only [3 restaurants/bars that take Bitcoin.](
They love their cash.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:41:04


Please tell me more.
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:17:36
Where in Japan do you live?
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:47:40


This is a win in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:52:24
My bet, he saved it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:59:55
Onya mate! 
I thought this was how the Bitcoin community worked when I first got into it. Since then, I discovered we're all Hodlers. 
Places like South East Asia is a perfect place for BTC to flourish. Lots of countries with different currencies. Changing money each time you change country is a pain in the arse. Locals are broke yet willing to try shit to make some money. Could you imagine after making a connection down there, you could get anything shipped to you? No middle man! Got a suit tailor made and want another one? Send em some bitcoin! 
It really is going to open up so so much.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:29:21
I like him too. What I find frustrating is when I see him going up, then I check BTC and it's going down so I then check to see when the roller coaster guy was posted and it was 10 hours ago. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:31:08


What country is he talking about? Is America that bad? I get 2.7% per year in Australia.
@_date: 2016-11-18 02:58:38
Do you know Reddit has you tagged as "Redditor for 10 days"? 
I'm not sure why they do this but I'm guessing it's to weed out trolls. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:47:24
The reason why I get 2.7% has nothing to do with Japan. It's what Aussie banks offer. [Here is an Aussie bank offering 2.7%](
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:24:45
Sir, can I have a bit of a bit?
Im guessing you're not doing Changetip if you need an address.

Would you be willing to go to Uzbekistan?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:12:21
Is that why it's dropping? Link?
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:04:07
You think it'll go down from now to next year?
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:01:46
I'm waiting to buy more until after the fork/segwit(?) I'm one of those dumb investors so I don't really get it but, all but I've heard is negative stuff will happen on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:43:30
Without looking too deep into a magic ball, how much correction are we expecting? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:05:11
If that's how you get Bitcoin donations, I'm in! 
Now, how do I get on telly?
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:23:37
I know it sounds like having your cake and eating it but, I think you're right. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:32:54
Wife and I did the same as you. We don't have a crystal ball. We have jobs that pay us monthly. We have no plan of pulling out until it goes mainstream. 
See you on the other side.
@_date: 2013-06-02 13:50:37
I was thinking of using Bitcoin because I could avoid the banks as they like to devalue the currency so they get more money. 
If the exchange rate was at 100 yen to A$1, they would give me something below 90c.
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:41:11
In Japan, the cards shown are used for trains. It's an incredibly efficient way of paying for your ticket and EVERYONE uses them and almost everyone goes to work by train. As well as that, the cards are used to pay at convenience stores, vending machines, and the like. Just tap to pay. Japanese people are already used to this. 
I believe if this is implemented, people will use it, even if it's just because it'll be worth more when they come to use it. The greater Tokyo area has 37.8 million people.  That's a lot of people who will have a Bitcoin wallet in their pocket. 
Edit: the trains don't accept debit cards.
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:00:02
[BIC Camera]( accepts BTC. They are one of the major electronic stores in Japan. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 00:52:58
I'm trying to work out if Bitcoin is for me and after reading many posts, I get the feeling the average Bitcoin user has trust issues.  
@_date: 2013-06-02 12:50:45
This might be the right thread to ask.
I'm thinking of using Bitcoin to send money home (Japan to Australia)
I have 3,000,000 yen to send.
Lets say the exchange rate is 100 yen to A$1, how much would I get? 
Australia is pretty slow at taking on new technology, so I guess selling it there could be a bit difficult.
Any advice would be much appreciated. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:03:02
I am one of these newbies that still doesn't get it.
I was tipped twice on Reddit with Bitcoin, told to make a wallet, which I did, but still couldn't find the info to move it over. 
I PMed the guy to ask how and he was really nice in his reply, but I still couldn't do it. 
Without someone looking over my shoulder showing me where to click, I don't think I'll ever get it.
I really want to get into this as I do a lot of money transfers to family overseas.
@_date: 2013-06-02 13:46:30
Pretend I'm stupid (I'm starting to think I am) can you explain this a bit easier?
I was thinking of avoiding the banks and sending the Bitcoins to a family member so they could sell it for me and then put it in my bank.
I'll check the links now.
@_date: 2013-06-02 13:58:13
but the exchange rate is shit. The last time I sent 3,00,000 yen home, I lost about $1000 because my bank set the rate a hell of a lot lower.
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:04:50
So that will make it about the same if I use Paypal or the post office. 
Thanks. This is the clearest info anyone has given me.
