I'm the attorney from Empowered Law; I'm also at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin. If you're here I'd be happy to make time to talk. After the conference I will be posting some articles on how I'm using block chain technology with my clients now and how I hope to use it in the future. Thanks for the interest!

Splitting your seed like that significantly reduces the security of your crypto holdings, instead consider using a passphrase or encryption phrase as a better way for "extra security". Good luck!

You can manage your own keys on hardware wallets. Ledger has an "on the go" adaptor you can use with an android phone:  If you're using Core on an air gapped machine, you're already WAY more advanced than most users. I don't use the Core wallet, so I can't help with those questions.
If you want to use Breadwallet, maybe ask them directly about what you want to do?

Caveat: I'm not a programmer, but I do work a lot with keys and key management.
Based on your post, I'm not sure if you're using seeds or independent private keys. I'll assume for this post you're thinking of using a single seed with multiple wallets and I'm about to explain why I think it's a bad idea. (Also, I'm not talking about restoring one seed to another wallet and then using that one wallet)
One serious risk is that by simultaneously using multiple, unrelated, uncoordinated wallet providers you are taking on the risk of unknown "bugs" creeping up. In other words, programmers make choices within the context of their programs. These choices are not universal, all wallets do not implement the same features - for example the same way of calculating fees, the same way of generating and using change addresses. There are standards that provide guidance but when you actually look at them, there is a LOT of room for interpretation as to how you would implement them within existing wallets. If you begin using different wallet providers, with different implementations, I think there is a significant chance that *something* will go wrong. And if it does, it will be your fault - not the multiple wallet company's -because they don't generally anticipate (nor do they design for) users to use keys in this way. Also, you could run into issues with gap limits (described below).
To your questions, in theory, Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients (most wallets) should check UTXO (for bitcoin associated with your keys) each time you open the app or launch the browser extension or website. Change addresses are built, like your other receive addresses, from the seed. For many implementations the "import wallet" function is different from the day-to-day SPV client function. Meaning the only time a larger "look for" UTXO function runs is at import. 
It's impossible for wallet software to check every possible address for a given seed - there are 2B plus possible keys per branch per child. So it's my understanding that programmers set a "gap limit" - in order to enable them to find keys with UTXO associated. Ever notice that some wallets won't let you create new addresses until you've used the previous one? The gap limit is why. When restoring a wallet (or importing, or sweeping a wallet), the software first needs to identify what keys on the tree have UTXO locked to them. It can't search everywhere, so it searches for addresses in a specific way (based upon standards and how the wallet itself provides addresses to users). It will start at the beginning of each branch that the programmers expected might have UTXO (for example 44'/0'/0'/0/1 branch) and it might look at the first 15 public addresses (for example, 15 is not a required number). If there is no UTXO locked to any of those addresses, the software interprets that to mean the branch is unused and will not continue checking down that branch (remember it can't check every address). This could pose a problem because if you use different wallets and they each use different branches and implement different gap limits, then the wallets might not "see" all of your UTXO. They might not even look at other branches after you import your seed. 
One of the other commenters said that their family uses Mycelium shared. In this context, that poses less of a problem because the choices of the Mycelium programmers are consistent with all uses. There is still the risk of loss of one device but it seems they are comfortable with that risk. It's much more likely you'll have trouble if you use multiple wallet providers, which I think is what you were asking about. 
If you give us more about what you're trying to accomplish then maybe there are other, safer ways to do it. I'm sure I haven't covered all of the risks and there are probably other issues too but hopefully you'll get a better idea of why I think this isn't being used more often. Also, each time you type in your seed words, they are less secure - due to key loggers etc. I really like hardware wallets for key management, if you haven't considered them yet, maybe take a look. Regardless, good luck!

You don't need a custodial service to do this. You can do it all on your own without a third party using multifactor multisig. You can also give one to your lawyer and one to an accountant or or store in a fireproof, secure location elsewhere. 
Also, be careful sharing keys in the will itself - in some counties people publicly register their wills, in many US jurisdictions they are made part of the public record when presented to the probate court.  
Another issue is key/password loss, ideally you'll be doing (at least) annual audits - making sure keys are still secure and accessible, making sure that you remember passwords and pins and that your loved ones know what they're supposed to do in case something happens.

Thanks! We have written an article to get people started with DIY planning: 
And here's an article for people to share with their attorney (if they have one): 
Remember, even with tech planning, your relatives could end up suing one another for the $ value of the bitcoin depending on local estate law. Money and grief often bring out the worst in people, even those you'd never think would be "like that". Just a little research and planning on your part might prevent fighting, misunderstandings, and court battles.
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:09:23
This is actually one of the services we offer at Third Key Solutions. It's important to consider both the tech side and legal side. Most people find it easiest to decide the allocation first. I recommend using percentages not hard values. For example, Alice shall receive 5% of all crypocurrency such as bitcoin, ether, zcash NOT Alice shall receive 5 bitcoin, etc. and NOT Alice shall receive $500 worth of bitcoin, etc. - because values and holdings change. (Ideally your plan will provide for your asset tokens and cryptocurrencies - each may require separate tech planning). 
For the legal side: Be sure whatever allocation you choose is consistent with your local law and that you leave the allocation instructions in writing, sign and date that paper. Hopefully, you'll make it part of a valid will or trust. If you have a lawyer you should run your plan by them, if they aren't crypto savvy have them contact me. Also consider how well your family gets along and whether you'll need extra planning to avoid fighting. 
Redundancy is your friend for long term planning. Your family members might move, change phone, email service providers, making them difficult or impossible for the 3rd party to find (depending on how privacy conscious they are). They might have a fire or burglary. I hope that doesn't happen to your family, but it's both possible and totally outside of your control. Consider additional redundant backups. Best of luck to you!

First page: 
CHICAGO – Secretary Bryan A. Schneider with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (“IDFPR”) has announced the release for comment of the Department's proposed “Digital Currency Regulatory Guidance” on decentralized digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. The proposed guidance expresses the IDFPR’s interpretation of Illinois’ Transmitters of Money Act (“TOMA”) and the application of its interpretation to various activities involving digital currencies. Decentralized digital currency is an electronic medium of exchange that is not created or issued by a central authority, is not legal tender, and can be used to purchase goods and services or to exchange for other currencies.
“As innovative payment technologies grow in popularity, it is vital that we provide a succinct regulatory framework that gives businesses operating in this space necessary clarity,” said Bryan A. Schneider, IDFPR Secretary. “We plan to study digital currencies carefully as the technology develops, however, at this point in time digital currencies like Bitcoin, given their low transaction volume and relatively niche use, are best viewed as a speculative investment or possibly even a new type of asset class, not as money.
IDFPR’s proposed guidance seeks to establish the regulatory treatment of decentralized digital currencies under existing definitions of money transmission in Illinois, as defined in the Illinois Transmitters of Money Act (205 ILCS 657). Digital currencies currently do not fit the statutory definitions of “money” and, therefore, do not independently trigger the licensing requirements of TOMA. However, some business activities involving decentralized digital currency that involve the receipt of “money” can trigger the licensing requirements of TOMA. IDFPR’s proposed guidance considers several types of digital currency activities and offers guidance on their licensing implications.
IDFPR will accept comments on the proposed guidance until January 18th, 2017 at 5:00pm CST.

Don't ever include your seed words in your will. It becomes a public document in many (but not all) jurisdictions. More importantly, lawyer's internal document management systems are notoriously insecure and often the docs are not stored encrypted. I'd hate to see you lose your BTC (or any other crypto) because of a data breach at your lawyer's office. 
I've been working on inheritance and cryptocurrency solutions for a couple of years now. Here are some free resources you can use to get started on estate planning yourself (without needing to hire a lawyer or another third party).
Start by learning what you need, what you don't, and why software solutions alone won't work well (yet).

I've been working on inheritance and cryptocurrency issues for the past few years and published a bunch of free stuff on Medium that might help you make a plan.

So sorry for your loss. A couple of things: 
(1) if you are in the US (and don't say whether you are or not in response to this message), then it could be considered illegal for you to use his credentials to login to his accounts (just a word of warning- be careful with what you do and what you claim to do publicly);
(2) don't throw away paperwork that has 12, 18, or 24 words that don't seem to make a sentence away or a long string of letters and numbers that don't seem to make any sense - they might be access keys; if you find something like this do not post a photo online - learn more before you take action, ask for advice about restoring a wallet, for example; totally agree with in that "However it's entirely possible there is other cryptocurrency besides what is on binance. Your best bet is to find someone familiar with cryptocurrency that you can trust, to go over your cousin's computer and find whatever might be there (which may be nothing). Do not let strangers from the internet get ahold of any information from that computer, because that could lead to them stealing the money."
(3) if he made a backup (copy of his access key) he would probably have stored it with things he cared about - think memorabilia or in a book he loved; or the usual secret hiding places - back of closet, between mattress, bottom of drawer type of places. 
(4) every exchange  that holds cryptocurrency for others *should* have a process in place for dealing with the death of clients, it will be a long process - you'll need death certificates and possibly a court order (maybe not, depends on the exchange and location);
(5) if he left no will then the laws of "intestacy" apply for all of his assets. you might want to google that term along with your location (state if you're in the US), to learn who has legal rights to his stuff. the thing is, if you don't find that out now, then later you might have issue with someone coming out of the woodwork claiming some right to his stuff. it will probably only take you an hour or less to find the laws, read them and understand them. if you don't understand them, then maybe you'll need a lawyer (but my guess is that between you and your wife you'll get it on your own);
(6) depending on your jurisdiction and his net worth, you might be able to use an expedited / streamlined process to legally deal with his creditors and assets. 
(7) he likely purchased the cryptocurrency using a bank account. with a death certificate and using proper paperwork / process you can get access to his bank records and see if there are other exchange accounts linked to the bank account. 
I hope this helps. Good luck and again I'm sorry for your loss.

Feel free to do what you want with your $ however using this system means that your loved ones (1) have to trust your single trusted person - incentive to hold the data hostage, (2) won't have access to your funds for more than a year - are you the primary source of income for them? (3) if your family knows this is coming they will have to keep your legal estate open until the coins are disbursed (or liquidated). 
Note:  assumes your heirs will open an estate, they may not - depending on your jurisdiction, the complexity of your estate, and your heirs.

thanks for pointing this out, it doesn't convey the message very well. it's not a ploy to try to get sales, it's a concern that people who don't know what they're doing might not do testing before moving their funds and accidentally move them to an address they can't recover from. I added in the contact us as a way to try to prevent that but of course it's not actually required.
EDIT: also the instructions explain that you should take out all things that don't apply to your situation. that includes removing all references to TKS if you don't want them, you can still easily use the template without mentioning TKS at all.

I assume you're talking about smart contracts using the bitcoin network. Eventually wallets will roll out functionality to do this sort of hierarchical multisig with time locks in bitcoin, but I'm not aware of any in production yet (if you've got one please let me know- I'd love to try it). 
**Everyone sees full automation as the perfect solution - but it's not.** Even if the tech side is fully automated, the human side isn't. Meaning it's likely your heirs will still involve a court in the distribution of your estate and the value of your coins will be considered part of the estate. If you have a simple family situation, no kids, a few other assets (small value), and don't live in a jurisdiction where your heirs need to file with the court in order to access assets, a tech solution alone might be okay but for most people I know that's not the case. The truth is that grief and money does strange things to people, often they behave differently than you might expect. 
If you have a will, it should be coordinated with your tech solution, otherwise there can be major problems. If you don't have a will, that can be even worse due to intestacy laws.
Giving the key to one family member (aka TTP) can also be risky as that person will then be in a position of power over the rest of the family when it comes to these assets, this could be an issue depending on your family dynamics.
Finally, depending on how much hodlings you have (or how much people think you have) automation or "the dead mans switch" can introduce an incentive for someone to prevent you from accessing your "smart lock", by way of preventing you from accessing the internet.
If you have the technical acumen and an awesome family to actually pull off a smart contract like this without any further planning that's fantastic -and rare.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:23:19
Actually, there is a way to do it without vesting all trust in a TTP (bank safe deposit box or estate lawyer or Coinbase). In fact, there's more than one way to do it. But there isn't a cookie cutter solution, something like this would require thought and planning on your part. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:09:08
When a third party is holding your coins, like a bank - like the traditional Coinbase wallet model, then they should have an internal policy as to inheritance and moving coins. They'll likely require a death certificate and proof of authorization, possibly even a court order to transfer the funds. 
It's a bit trickier when people are holding their own coins but it is doable -you don't need a "trusted third party" and with a little planning your heirs can still inherit your coins.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:44:31
No, we do not create plans that depend on us - ever. That's a single point of failure and honestly, I wouldn't trust another company with my btc (no matter how big they are) why should you?
For most people, the goal is to create plans that you control completely until you die and someone, anyone (or more than one) you choose - your heirs, your lawyer, a court, your executor can transfer the assets just like any other asset. But these things really depend on you, your heirs, and your family situation. We help you identify the risks, you decide what's best for you. 
Sometimes people know their "person" won't understand crypto and they want someone honest to help with the process who won't steal from their heirs. Someone who can give them a 101 course and teach them what they need to know to hold their inheritance safely. Remember, the alternative is to come here and ask for help or to try to reach out to the local community. If Third Key has already helped someone with their plan, it makes sense to reach out to us first. Especially if your person is close to you and will be grieving at the time. But it's never required.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:11:57
Agreed, I thought this question was about coins being lost forever. Point is they will likely become sweepable at *some* point in the future. Could be 5, 50 + years. I wasn't trying to suggest people need to keep watch.

Wills become public records in a lot of jurisdictions (US + beyond), so it's a bad idea to include your private keys in your will. I've been working on these issues for a few years and published some free resources on Medium that you might find useful: 
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:36:05
because lawyers are required to be registered with the government, they're pretty easy to sue if they steal from you. at least in the U.S., bar associations don't take kindly to lawyers stealing from clients.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:50:14
Yes it's *possible* but requires cooperation from the exchange. I'm currently doing research on inheritance policies of exchanges and hosted wallets around the world. Many don't have policies in place yet. Most have dealt with the death of at least one client. All require a death certificate plus other documentation and none move quickly :)

Lots of free resources for inheritance planning: 
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:14:59
I didn't say trustless, I said not vesting all trust in a TTP. Huge difference. Diluting the trust, creating a system where you need more than one piece in order to access is the best way I know of to mitigate TTP risk (but smartly so that your estate can actually recover).

If you're still interested in doing inheritance planning you might find the free resources I've published on Medium helpful:

that only works if (1) you pay the bill for the box on time, (2) your heirs know you have a safe deposit box, (3) you have no reason to think the contents of your safe deposit box will be compromised or accessed through court order or bank error, (4) you only ever use one seed or account, (5) and even with the password, without a more formal plan or instruction document they probably won't know what to do with the password and will have to call in a "friend" or "helper" who might help themselves to some or all of the coins. 
this option is better than doing nothing, for sure, and it might even work for you and your family. but for most people a more comprehensive plan is better and it's not that hard to do.

Don't do this unless you are absolutely sure that in your jurisdiction wills do not become public documents. In many places, especially in the U.S. once a will is submitted to a court (which is the first thing you do) it becomes part of the public record. Anyone (anybot) watching public filings will see it and it's likely the coins will be moved before your heirs or the court even knows what happened.

@_date: 2017-09-06 20:03:03
Not true. In some jurisdictions, some people file their will with the court clerk when executed. Yes, technically the details are not to be made public during ones lifetime, I wouldn't trust that with my btc. While it is true that most often a will is filed with the court after your death, the assets do not automatically move upon your death. Most often the heirs (and too often the lawyers) do not know enough about crypto to move it safely (and lawfully) before it becomes public record.
That said, leaving keys in your will is better than not leaving them at all. At least someone (but likely not your heirs) will get them.

Assuming you and your spouse will never separate; that they would never, ever cash out your coins without discussing it with you while you're alive; that they don't currently have and will never have a gambling, drug or similar problem; and that they can remember and follow your instructions after you're gone - then this simple plan can work (if you write down the instructions). 
Doesn't work if both you and your spouse pass at the same time though, which might not matter to you. Maybe you don't want anyone else to inherit, that's your choice. 
Doesn't work if you have children with a person other than your spouse, it could create a situation where your kids would have to fight the spouse in court. 
Every family is different. Some solutions work for some families, those same solutions in other situations would be catastrophic. People and relationships change over time. That's why people put off doing inheritance planning, they face the reality of death, their family complexities, and that's not usually fun. But if you think of it like a game of giving gifts after you're gone it can make the planning process much easier and less stressful.

at some point in the future the cryptography protecting our coins will need to be updated. (not likely in the next 5 years from what I understand, I'm not an expert in cryptography) at that point, people/bots will troll the blockchain looking for old UTXO protected by broken outdated crypto, create transactions to aggregate it and transfer it to themselves and get a free payday. therefore it's unlikely most of the "lost" coins will remain out of circulation forever. 
by the way, this is one of the many reasons it's a bad idea to just put a seed or password in a safe and forget about it for years.

Hahah - good point but I doubt eBay and Amazon are eating that cost. I think they pass the cost to sellers even if the buyer is in the wrong. Seems unfair to me. I see why you like it as a buyer but I think we can do better. And we have to do better for peer-to-peer transactions where there's no middleman, no eBay or Amazon.
Agreed, today the script couldn't tell the customer that you did a bad job and they might need some time to discover that the job was bad too. There are lots of nuances, lots of options, and I expect it will be a trial and error process, like everything. 
Thanks for your very kind words. Yes, this is a very tough puzzle to solve - that's why we're looking for engagement from the community. If people aren't interested, then there's no reason to pursue it.

Thanks for your comment. Identity is required for most dispute resolution systems today but our research aims to expand the realm to those that are identity optional. 
Re: the stranger determining who wins. Maybe I'm missing your point but the value there seems to be dispute resolution without having to go to a local court. If you did go to court, you'd see a stranger (the judge) trying to determine whether or not a product was delivered as requested too. Knowing the identity of judges in local court gives us the illusion of having recourse but most bad decisions aren't overturned. And it takes a ton of money and effort to get there.
Currently we don't get to choose our judges. We hope that with an ADR framework like DAMN our community can expand the scope of who can be judges (in our systems), how we hold them accountable, and implement features in the technology to provide for better decision-making.

Thank you for the questions! 
- Agreed, the idea is not to provide a one-size solution but to develop a suite of choices. People get to choose what's best for them. 
- Standards are a huge issue. Existing systems have lots of different rule sets for process (what is 'evidence', how to produce, will there be a hearing or documents only, etc.). ADR contracts also reference existing law, sometimes local, sometimes international. Ideally, parties will make informed choices as to what their preferred rules and laws will be. At some point (far in the future) I think it would be interesting to design sets of rules as a community. 
- "decision-making options" was actually meant to illustrate identity-optional systems. In other words, today the system doesn't provide many options for identity-optional recourse - meaning we must often trade identity for the privilege of recourse. We'd like some other options. 
- Not sure yet about bonds or insurance. They may be recommended for some identity-optional contracts. The presence of dispute resolution systems recognized by local law might make people more willing to offer bonds or insurance options. 
- We won't be able to answer this question until we do much more research. 
- The strategic vision goes well beyond an open source interface to traditional ADR methods. There are plenty of options for experimenting with things like who are decision makers (developing algorithms, groups of experts, using prediction markets, etc.), what they charge (revenue model), whether those will be public or private decisions (where to publish if public), identity (what options exist for identity-optional resolutions), what rules and laws will apply, and many more. We need a framework for experimentation, that's what we aim to provide.

Be sure to test any new wallets with small amounts before you send large $ to them, to make sure you can actually get $ out when you need to later.

Thanks for watching and for the comment, super helpful because if that's what it seemed like I was saying then i need to clarify and be more clear next time. 
The idea isn't to backup your Trezor on a Copay wallet, the idea is if you lose your Trezor and need to move funds quickly (because you think the person who has it might have your PIN or be able to guess it in a short amount of time)  you can load the seed (from paper backup) onto any software wallet (including Copay for example) and use it to move funds to a NEW wallet (possibly a hardware wallet if you have the forethought and funds to get more than one). The point I was trying to emphasize is that BIP39 seeds can be restored on both hardware and software wallets. Many people worry that they have to buy another Trezor if they lose it because that is the only way they can recover. While that may be the most secure solution, I was trying to explain that it is not the only solution.
Thanks again for pointing this out!

But if you want your family to inherit your crypto, then memorization isn't a good solution.

I might be able to help, I've been working on long-term storage and estate planning solutions with bitcoin for a few years now. Like others, I'm a fan of hardware wallets (open source), you could also consider a multisig plan, with hardware wallets for added security and resiliency. I just did an in depth talk about this at the Sydney bitcoin meetup last week. The video will be posted soon. Here's a link to a similar talk at the Zurich meetup from March of this year: 
People with small holdings or simple family situations can often create a plan on their own (read and follow our articles for help), those with more complex family situations or larger holdings might need some extra help from our company, ThirdKey.Solutions. 
Our solutions discovery package gives you a detailed implementation guide, including hardware and software choices, that is customized to your needs. Take a look at the articles and if you want help, feel free to contact us.

I didn't see this response, sorry for the delay. 
Yes, the mnemonic words are enough. Agreed Slush at SatoshiLabs (trezor fame) and the others are brilliant. You can read more about BIP39 here: 
You shouldn't create your own mnemonic words (that's a brain wallet and your instincts are correct -it's insecure). Your Ledger will  walk you through the process of secure seed generation. 
Regarding a passphrase (which is different from the mnemonic words) if I were doing this, I'd try using the hardware wallet without the passphrase first (so you can get comfortable). Then try opening and closing the wallet with and without a passphrase. Don't move all your money into it before testing to make sure you can move it out. Also, for your passphrase, don't use 12 random words, you don't need to. Just use something that is easy for you to remember - because if you forget it ((without a backup) you'll be locked out of your $ forever. After you're comfortable with the hardware wallet, then move your larger amount into it. Of course this assumes you have no reason to believe your keys are compromised. 
Regarding the fork, remember you'll have coins on both sides of any fork. Be careful of replay attacks though (where a transaction on one side can be broadcast on the other, effectively causing you to double pay). It's my understanding that if there's a fork it's best to wait awhile before doing any transactions. 
Good luck!

Hi. Thanks for the questions, there is a LOT here and I'll try to break it down issue by issue. 
**Backing Up Your Wallet**: Your wallet should have a backup feature. Sometimes it's hidden in settings; it's worth looking for. You should follow your wallet's instructions for backing up, regardless of what the underlying key structure is (regardless of whether it's a seed or key). To answer your question, "what exactly am I supposed to backup", backup whatever the wallet asks you to backup. If there is no backup option, you're either using a really old (unsupported) wallet or you could be using a custodial account (e.g. Coinbase) and you should consider moving to a wallet you control. 
**Menmonics:** The wonderful thing about mnemonic words is that you can use those 12-18-24 words as a "backup" of all of your keys generated from that mnemonic. So if you're using a wallet that uses mnemonic words, then simply by backing up the words, you'll effectively be backing up all of the keys. Instead of making individual backups of each key, a mnemonic allows you to backup all keys in an efficient manner. The mnemonic is the backup for all currently used keys AND all keys that will be created by your software. Meaning you will have a backup of the key for your new change address before it actually has funds in it!
**Wallet Implementations Differ:** You mention that "whenever some of a private key's bitcoins are spent, then that private key is being completely depleted of its bitcoins and the leftover change is sent to a newly generated private key". Yes-ish. What you're describing is an industry best practice in software development of bitcoin wallets - not a feature of the protocol. In other words, wallet developers must implement this as a feature of their wallets. It's a software choice, not a feature of all bitcoin transactions.  My guess is that there are a number of "old" wallets in use around the world today that do not implement this best practice. So it is possible someone could be using a wallet that sends change to the original address. But even if your wallet is following this practice, it's good to always have a backup key of any address you've ever used. I know, that sounds crazy but here's why
**Bitcoin Addresses are Forever:** Meaning anyone can send funds to an address anytime, even accidentally. There's no way to prevent someone from sending funds to an address, there's no way to "close the account", like there is in a bank, so keeping a backup of all of your keys is a best practice. If you've ever had a public tip or donation address, you'd want to keep those keys forever, because even if you removed the address from your public pages, it's possible for someone to find an old cache of your page and send funds to it. Another real example (that has happened to me), if I send one of my clients a payment address in an invoice, they might accidentally (or intentionally) use that same payment address for the next invoice (even if I designate a new address). 
In the video, all of the above was shortened and simplified to "backup your private keys". Over-simplification is sometimes the cost of only having 30 minutes to discuss "bitcoin security", a topic that requires much more detail. I hope this clarifies the issue and answers your questions. Please let me know if you've got more. And thanks for taking the time to post.

Thank you so much for mentioning this. I was concerned when I saw this comment and so I went back to review the video. When giving a "newbie" presentation, we often gloss over things that seem perfectly clear to us but actually need additional clarification, and in this instance I agree I wasn't clear so I'd like clarify here. 
Specifically what I said is "unless you are using a hardware wallet, you are exposing your private key to an online environment". What that means is that when you apply a signature to a transaction, your private key will be unencrypted, in memory on your laptop or desktop for a short period of time. The laptop or desktop that is running your software wallet is what I mean by "online environment'. If that device has a trojan, rootkit, or keylogger on it you run the risk of key compromise. If you are re-using the same key, each time you use it you expose the key to compromise, on the local machine. 
Certainly, the private key is not exposed on the blockchain with ECDSA signatures. Otherwise we'd have much bigger problems. I didn't mean to imply that in any way, and thanks to you, next time I'll be clearer in the explanation.

Both Trezor and Ledger can also be used with Copay (open source by Bitpay) - Android, iPhone, Linux, OSX, Windows;  I'm not affiliated with any of these companies, just use all three products myself and like them.

Well, hopefully in the short term (now-20 years) people will do estate planning so their heirs can inherit their bitcoin. For a longer time frame than that, your idea seems pretty close to what they say will happen - but instead of re-mining, the cryptography will become obsolete/broken. Those of us still around will upgrade our coins, locking them with  newer more secure algorithms. But people who aren't around/active will likely lose their coins to people who sweep the blockchain for coins locked with the old broken crypto.
