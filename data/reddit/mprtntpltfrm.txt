This shows very well how incompetent the devs of B2X are. Oh wait. I think there is only 1 dev so i should use singular:

Hey, there are a lot of unsubstantiated claims in your reply. I will list them here:
- "Bitcoin is backed by... media attention"
- "It crashes and peaks depending on whose whining or lauding it"
- "It's got no serious foundation"
- "It's literally a hot air balloon running on hype"
- "it hasn't yet become important enough for authorities to act against in any serious way"
You are presenting a lot of assumptions, but very few facts. Maybe you should apply for a listing on bitcoin obituaries.

Sorry, I must call BS on that.
"The point is you don't know when it'll fail." applies much more to currencies like EUR or USD. Bitcoin will prevail. Don't believe it? Just wait and see.
Almost everyone (look at the chart) who had previously bought BTC did not need to "get out in time". All they needed to do is to be patient and wait for the exchange rate to go through the roof in order to sell their BTC with a massive gain.
