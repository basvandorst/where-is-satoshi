If fees are low enough, definitely daily trading, if not then i'll just keep it till i get twice the amount for example ( if that's a viable option).
 Actually I just said binance because a friend recommended it, but if i can do it all on bitstamp then bitsamp it is! I mean i prefer if i can just do everything in one place.
Will definitely transfer to  a wallet once i hit that amount, heard it's the safest thing to do

Thank you! Didn't think about it that way, so now i guess I just need to find out how to buy bitcoin.. is there any exchange i can buy some on? that's not locked out like coinbase :( (im in europ)

So im new to bitcoin, was wondering which one of these exchanged has the least fees? And is it possible to sell bitcoin to eur on these exchanges? Like send your profits to your bank account / credit card after selling bitcoins

Thanks for the reply!! But would I be losing a lot on fees since i'd have to move it to my wallet then back to binance? By a ton i mean in percentage, i wanted to invested around 200, and read somewhere that fees are around 20 usd etc ( since it's my first time )

So the right time to buy is the lowest so that you maximise on gains? ( otherwsie you'll lose potential gains amiright?)

hello, new to bitcoin, given the current dip, is it the moment to buy bitcoin? And is coinbase the right place to do so rn? (im in europ, if you know any other good exchange let me know, I was thinking about buying bitcoin on coinbase and then trading it on binance but everything seems to be locked down now..)
