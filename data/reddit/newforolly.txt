Can you explain in step by step detail how you got scammed?
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:20:08
Thanks, does this apply to UK residents to?
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:26:27
What was the sellers username, you username and which country are you located in?
Your first course of action is to open a support ticket by clicking up in the top right hand corner drop down menu, then support. Explain as best you can your situation including as much detail as possible and link them to the trade. They will most likely ask for proof of payment, I advise taking a screen shot of your online banking and maybe getting a paper statement and taking a photo of it. 
You can find your cancelled trades by going to 
If the seller still has a balance in their Local Bitcoins wallet then support will most likely send you your Bitcoins. If the sellers wallet is empty then there is nothing that can be done however your report will stop others from getting scammed by this account. 
Fingers crossed for you dude.

Hey, Local Bitcoins trader in the UK here. 
The best experience you can have with PayPal is by never using it, if you don't get scammed you will most likely have your account closed by PayPal unless you have an in depth knowledge of how their system works. 
I recommend using national bank transfer option or cash deposit directly in to your account if your countries banking system offers such services.

Hi OP, I was there! Id starting trading on Local Bitcoins around this time so I was watching the market every day. Here’s what I remember. 
We broke out of the bear market late October and pumped good, up to around $500. Many people called for a bull trap and it looked like they were right when the price dumped he next day. Low and behold though, the price recovered slightly and went on to form a huge consolidation triangle that seemed to go on forever. 
During this consolidation triangle there was massive debate both here and on bitcoin markets reddit regarding bull vs bear. The believers were believing but some were still bearish after having been beaten with red candles for 18 months. No one could say for certain which way it was going to go but the big argument from bulls was ‘BLOCK HALVING IS COMING’. 
Fast forward to May and we broke out of the triangle to the upside. Bitstamp saw a flash crash directly to $1.50 shortly afterward but apart from that it was all upward. 
It took a long while for sentiment to become mega lambs bullish. For a long time people were losing faith even though the price was going up. See mike Hearn, bcash etc 
@_date: 2019-03-31 04:20:00
Depends what you’re using it for.
You could be buying small amount, buying regularly to make a living from local bitcoins, could be doing a one off billion $$ purchase. Different banks suit different requirements.
@_date: 2019-03-22 11:32:15
Cash deposit on local bitcoins has no id options but the premium is higher than usual 
@_date: 2019-03-31 04:17:03
I think you’ll have a hard few months buying here but in the long run it’s great time to buy. 
Unpopular opinion probably but hey, it’s good not to be an echo chamber right? 
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:19:54
We’ve had them not work out of the box before on multiple occasions. We’ve also had token balances disappear with no possible explanation from the coins team or ledger.... coins disappearing is where I draw the line

I would always choose a trezor over ledger

I like watching videos of Diego from rootstock (layer two protocol) and have learned a lot from him. 
Another expert I have a lot of respect for is Antonis Polmitis. He runs the masters course in digital currency with Andreas. This playlist is ram packed with high quality learning material from them both as part of their mooc.

How is it decided which block is orphaned and which block stays on the chain?

How do you expect us traders to trade if we don’t have any coins on LBC? It’s impossible to make a living on LBC without having coins on there

Carrying on from another question here. 
What is an orphaned block and how does it happen?
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:57:16

Halvening is triggered roughly ever four years. It’s done on amount of blocks so you can never be exactly sure on the timescale as block times vary. 
I assume the math to work out the exact triggerwould be ((24 * 60)/10) * 365) * 4)
2 - True 
3 - deflationary 
4 - True 
5 - 50
6 - oooh hard one. I’ve seen the list but can’t remember the amount of entries. I’m going to guess at 250. 
7 - non of the words are similar to one another, therefore the user cannot accidentally wrote down the wrong word.
8 - december 2008
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:39:49
I was considering bitcoin to be deflationary because the block reward is deflationary. After seeing the other answers I see I was wrong, bitcoin supply is inflating every ten minutes.
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:17:45
Trezor by far. It’s the only one that doesn’t break.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:54:35
And Satohsi and Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:03:43
I agree. Doesn’t mean people won’t pay attention and base their decisions from it though.
