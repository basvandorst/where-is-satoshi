I think arbitrage plays some part in it. But the FUD plays the huge role it seems.

Also these days ppl are heavily monitoring changes thru Facebook groups, alerts, telegram groups. We can't say ppl aren't watching closely. 
Bcse one person in the group starts or informs the message, it will open the floodgates.

Liquidity matters here. Nobody will buy 1m coins. You can do this in multiple exchanges and price will not fluctuate that much until unless you are selling for lower price.
By selling at lower prices, you can create FUD, can do arbitrage. But you'll lose money.

Is it? Coinbase isn't operating in all countries. So you can't create acct in coinbase, if you're from the non coinbase supported countries. 
This is just one example. Many of them are still there.

A single person can't have accounts in different exchanges located in different countries, bcse the KYC part doesn't allow them to do so. 
So how can the dump happened in some US exchange will reflect in some Asian exchanges? (I can only think of FUD here, I may be wrong)

But the thing is, this has happened across all the exchanges at most same time. It seems like a set of ppl who has accounts in all the exchange has been doing this activity.
How is this possible?

It's a serious question though, if you don't have anything to contribute pls dont spam the post. 
I'm looking for technical and in-depth details

Is that binance? What data went missing?

Got it. So it concludes that, we shouldn't blame whales for the heavy dumps. Actually they give resistance at lower price point.
