OP, why do you believe people must panic buy dollars if not btc? Cash is not a long term investment. You're mistaking no crypto with having to buy USD. Instead you could plow your USD into other assets like precious metals (bad idea, IMO, with no long term growth), real-estate, or equities.

Long term bitcoin has $0 value. It will stay above this as a novelty. Hundreds maybe, a couple grand (same reason some people still hold onto beanie babies waiting for that market to go back up).
My best guess is it never hits the peak before. I've always known it would burst and it's increasingly looking like this time is the final burst of the bitcoin fad.

lol, mining has no relevance to its price at all.
If I hire a man at $10/hour to carve stones for me and it takes him 100 hours per stone, and btw he is an awful sculptor and the stones look like crap, do they nonetheless have a minimum value of $1000 because I was stupid enough to pay that?
If I am piss drunk and buy your 2011 corolla for $50k cash, is it worth $50k minimum because that's what I paid for it?

If you owe $1M US dollars and you own a printing press you can pay that debt off for the cost of ink, paper, and your credibility.
If you owe a thousand ounces of gold, you need to actually procure a thousand ounces of gold and if you trash your currency, it's harder to get.

I do not believe this. I think you are scared to hell that this time it's different. And you know what? it is.
What you don't get is that nobody had ever heard of bitcoin until last year, not really. Then it started getting pumped across the media to the point most people had heard of it. That's the final step in a pyramid. At this point there is no new meat relatively speaking.

The sort of person who brags to her friends about how much money she has probably has little anyway.

Um, I wrote this same thing on a forum (as did others) years ago. It's textbook deflationary. Bitcoin supporters engage in much mental gymnastics to try and explain how it's not but bitcoin never was or could or would ever become a tenable currency because of the deflationary nature of it.

People have been aware of gold forever. They aren't in it because it doesn't pay. Compared to equities long term gold is a terrible, awful investment.
BTW, it's still a million times better than crypto because in 10 years bitcoin won't be worth a cup of soup and your gold will be. It's just not going to return as much over the next decade as stocks (probably, can't say with certainty of course).

@_date: 2018-03-03 14:44:01


I hold a completely antithetical view. I think broadly bitcoin is breathing its last gasps. It may go up some more from here. It may even hit new highs, but the emperor's lack of clothing is becoming ever apparent. Going all in at this time is probably a terrible move. Trading volume is down, governments are openly talking about regulating it, SEC probes, etc. there is too much fraud going on to be taken seriously.
But what do I know, I'm just a wage cuck who lives in a nice house, drives nice cars, and has a retirement fund I've been gradually but consistently growing over the last decade+. Ignore me and listen to people who are taking out debt for bitcoin, don't have two legitimate pennies to rub together, and "have it all figured out".

One of the non-negotiable tenets of a currency is stability. Volatility means people will avoid using it.

Bitcoin will crash to under $1k and hang around in the hundreds, with some people buying it as a novelty, until eventually down the line it dwindles down to virtually nothing, with its final value dictated by whatever a curator at a museum feels it is worth to pay for legitimate bitcoins that he can stick on a flash card, put behind a glass display, and say there are bitcoins here.

"With a stable currency". It's like me prefacing a paragraph about how i'm the best runner in the world if only I can run a 2 minute mile. Bitcoin will only ever be stable when it is worth $0. If I can have a wallet on my laptop and then I lose it and I've now permanently impacted the money supply for the world, forever, irrecoverably, and other people keep doing what I am doing, with infinite time you would end up with infinitely little bitcoin available.  And so infinite value.

If they were, there won't be a recover to new highs. Ever. That will be that. It was always sacrosanct that bitcoin's endpoint would be $0 or very close to it, the question has never been that, but always how long it would take to get there and how many cycles of rekt before it was cemented.
