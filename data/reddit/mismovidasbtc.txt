Now I better understand what does "provably fair" mean.
As far as I know, Euromillions is not "provably fair" in the sense that there is not** any pseudo-random number generator feeded with a seed that you could check after the draw.
Euromillions result is based on the process of taking a ball from a machine which contains several balls. Every ball has a printed number on its face and the numbers on the balls taked randomly from the machine are the numbers of the winning combination.
The process is (if you want such a fancy name) "uniform random fair" in the sense that, on average, any number is favored more than other. Stats on numbers can be found at 
It doesn't impact Satómbola in any manner, it's just a different process to obtain the winning result.
**You could consider that as an sort of pseudo-random number generator with the seed being the dimensions of the machine, the balls initial position, the machine rotating speed. The instants of taking a ball would act as iterations on the PRNG. But it doesn't make it provably fair because they don't provide us these data to buy one of these machines and repeat the draw at home.

I agree. This is either a clever scam or a terrifying maneuver to put down and demonize bitcoin.

I'm new to bitcoin and webmastering and I've recently opened a raffle site at 
I've seen a lot of gambling/lottery sites based on bitcoin but i was doubtful about the people's opinion about these sites.

It isn't there because I did forget that one :D
Thanks, now is corrected and seems much clearer.
As I've said, the site is new so, your comment is very valuable feedback which helped me to improve the page.

Yes, the draws at  are fair because are based on the result of "Euromillions", the european lottery. Anyone can check the resullts of "Euromillions" and calculate the winner saticket at Satómbola.

Thanks a lot! For playing, for visiting, for paying attention, for the comment, ...
I thought it was corrected, but uploaded an outdated file. And
that file would be still there if you didn't warn me!
Ah, the hard beginning.
This is my first site and i'm very excited, because
this comment proofs that my site was read by other people.
Dind't expect nobody will read so far that boring text :D !
Less than 24 h left for the first draw of SatómBola.
Good luck!

Thanks. I'm signing up the forum. Do you have any user name there? They ask me for a referrer user.

Not necessarily. Maybe the exchanges that have never been hacked remain unhacked by their own merits.And they can learn about their sibling's failures to improve their security.
Furthermore, this is not a failure in a security system, is the (unintended) refusal to use one.

It's going to be hard to join that huge amount of BTC.
Maybe you coud try a raffle like [**SatómBola**]( if you feel lucky.

Thanks! Just started and my priority is functionality over aesthetics. But yes, it's an ugly page.English is not my mother language. If something sounds weird feel free to point me whith your finger and laugh at me while repeating my words ridiculously with foreign accent.
