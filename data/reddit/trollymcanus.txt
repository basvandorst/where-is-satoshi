Fuck off
@_date: 2014-02-15 10:07:19
And we all know what will happen on monday. Another statement how they will make a statement soon about when people can get their coins/money out again. 
People who think otherwise are delusional. 
The downvoting in this thread is crazy. A lot of butt hurt going on. 
For months against all warnings you idiots kept using Gox and now get upset when reality kicks in. Suckers. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:30:01
To protest Bitcoin? What?
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:36:59
You are very simple, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:37:47
It should be clear to even the biggest believers there won't be any coins going to other exchanges. They are dead. They can't/won't pay people. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:38:00
All i'm seeing is the price going down because people lost interest. It's been what, 5 years now?
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:38:20
Idiot. Completely delusional. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:21:12
I find my news on Reddit, i then copy and paste it on my shitty blog and spam it on Reddit again. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:03:24
Thanks. We had no idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:11:32
Only we, the average users, seem to care. The guys on top can't be bothered that one man is taking Bitcoin down. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:13:16
No. Use the search. There are at least 50 topics explaining it. I truly hope nobody answers you. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:12:45
The news has shaken confidence in Bitcoin. Prices dropped sharply overnight, though they've since bounced back to about $660.
Amazing how these people just pull facts out their ass for a living.
Oh and OP this bullshit has been posted 30 times already several days ago, you idiot.  
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:10:27
But he won't. What more evidence do you need that he's causing this fear on purpose. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:37:20
Stop it already! Idiots!
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:09:37
Oh look. Another "fact" pulled straight out of someone's ass. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:14:13
Wrong Reddit. Reported. 
You're the 4th person in 2 hours to post random financial news. And it's annoying as hell. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:16:37
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:26:05
More difficult than using the search. And considering that is too hard for most people already i'd say you're fine. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:08:54
Awesome man. You copy and pasted it from this Reddit, put it on your site and spammed it right back here! 
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:05:22
Look before posting man. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:13:04
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:09:17
Fuck off
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:15:28
Really? Wow, i wonder why we haven't seen any posts about this yet!
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:21:30
Oh fuck off you moron! Anyone posting that picture should be instantly banned. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:23:45
Meth is bad. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:11:21
But but...then there will be no Bitcoin circle jerk!
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:59:25
Fucking hell! Stop reposting you idiots!
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:48:56
If i see one more thread that goes like this "made up fact - here's why" i might hurt someone. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:45:56
An anouncement of an anouncement. Who would've guessed. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:56:57
You mean like their new trading engine and Litecoin last year?
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:47:06
I started reading but felt like throwing up after 2 minutes so i stopped. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:08:55
Wrong Reddit. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:13:13
Wrong forum. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:24:43
Stop spamming you idiot! And the title is misleading. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:48:13
Yes we know. It's on the mainpage!
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:29:15
Nobody is going to take you seriously if you type like this. Doesn't that bother you?
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:12:57
Wrong forum. Reported
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:22:56
Listen you dumb fuck, i'm talking about his writing style. Are you retarded or what?
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:08:57
Yes. I can easily see him do that. 
If you carefully read his press releases you'll see that every time he manages to gives us no information whatsoever and keep people in fear for another week. It's 100% clear the fucking asshole does this on purpose. Why? We can only guess but you can be sure he benefits from it.
And the board members? They don't give a shit that their buddy is taking Bitcoin down for his own gains. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:34:18
You skipped the part where people need to buy Bitcoins first. But fuck that right. It would make your circle jerk less interesting. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:25:26
Oh fuck off already!
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:08:46
Stop fucking spamming you idiot!
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:59:22
Ah yes, this will change EVERYTHING!
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:20:58
You must have had that last batch of good weed before SR2 shut down. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:11:37
You're 15, right?
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:58:52
Fuck off. It's already posted 15 times. You're just spamming your site. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:11:27
You type like a 12 year old. Are you 12?
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:22:29
I just threw up in my mouth a little. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:24:35
Bullshit story. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:11:29
One statement with some details is all it takes from Gox's side to make this madness stop. But they won't do that. 
This alone is enough proof that they are letting this happen on purpose. 
This member of the Bitcoin foundation is taking Bitcoin down on purpose. And gets away with it. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:57:18
Here's the sad truth. People will keep using Gox and in a few months from now we will crash again because of them. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:54:42
So you came to a Bitcoin Reddit full of kids who will claim 1 Bitcoin will worth 100k by next year and then asked these kids what you should do with your money and now you blame other people for your loss? This has to be some kind of trolling account. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:02:01
The search. The fucking search makes it valuable. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:54:11
You are so new to the internet that you don't even know what the search is for?
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:02:55
So when a country goes to shit you're happy right?
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:34:27
How many more times are you gonna post that bullshit? Get the hint. Nobody gives a fuck about your emotional emancipation crap. 
I'm reporting it for spam. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:24:19
Amazing. You figured it all out kiddo. 
Ok, i'm off to the next topic full of facts. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:04:17
Exactly. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:54:31
Mark removed from the foundation would be the best thing ever for Bitcoin. Keep in mind that goddamn fucking idiot is responsible for at least 3 crashes. Keep in mind he rather sees Bitcoin going down than admitting doing something wrong. 
With every press release that fucking asshole makes sure to cause more panic and take the price down even lower. This is one man, one man taking Bitcoin down on his own! This has to stop!
And the board members? They just watch it happen and don't give a fuck. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:30:16
Kraken is hardly used. They're doing this to get more customers. Too bad for them these customers are all dumb ass 16 year olds. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:26:34
Just don't use the search man. That would bring you 50 topics that answer your question. No, instead start yet a new topic about it. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:14:38
Fuck off man
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:51:36
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:10:40
Don't you idiots ever get tired of starting these worthless "here is why" threads. 30 mins from now another idiot will start a thread that says "mtgox will continue to do business. Here is why". 
Do you see how completely useless your "facts" are?
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:11:52
Please, just stop it with these threads!
@_date: 2014-02-16 09:59:51
And again: what do you think the search is for. Take a guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:03:26
Oh right, because Macs can't get infected right?
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:48:43
Yes, they use Bitcoin to fool users in buying their useless hardware. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 07:38:20
Yes i have advice. Use the goddamn search and read one of the 200 existing topics. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:41:24
Why do you people keep answering these idiots!
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:57:45
Fuck off. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:34:44
Mark, the Bitcoin foundation member, fucking everyone over again. Did anyone seriously expect anything else?
This guy won't stop till Bitcoin is worth 1 dollar or less.  
Every single move this guy makes is to make sure Bitcoin goes down even more. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:13:16
What is there possibly to downvote?
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:33:21
You are the first person to come up with this. No really, nobody has ever thought of this. It's also not posted in 34 threads already. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:59:01
Ok, i read 20 random comments on that Reddit. I feel so stupid now. It made me dumb. 
Is that shit for real? What is the average age there? 7?
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:23:59
Awesome, let's repost last weeks news because it wasn't reposted enough already on the day itself.
