Not sure if it is the cheapest, but I have had good experience with Coinbase/GDAX.
Create account and get verified at coinbase and buy small amount with credit card, high fees. Then transfer small amount using bank transfer (swift) to test, normal Swift fees, so do not think you will get it cheaper any where else. While waiting for the test to go through, go through the extra verification steps to get your coinbase account upgraded to GDAX.,Then transfer what you want to invest. move all your € from coinbase to GDAX, and buy your cryptocurrency.
I think you might be able to skip the Coinbase part, and just create GDAX account and transfer via Swift directly to GDAX. Not sure, but no fees transferring from Coinbase to GDAX, and it was the process that worked for me.

Also had problems making deals on coinbase before moving to GDAX. Especially during the big bull run early December. Guess they were overloaded.
But no problems on GDAX.

Well, think about it. As a European, I can not trade BTC/USD on GDAX. Assume the opposite is the case for US citizen.

There is a many seas of complaints as there is places to buy cryptocurrency and exchanges.
I have used Coinbase for a few Fiat to  BTC transfers, credit card and Swift. No problems. High fee on credit-card, normal bank rates on Swift. Very high fees both trading and sending crypto.
Go through the extra verification and get registered on Coinbase's real exchange, GDAX, where trading fees are normal.
