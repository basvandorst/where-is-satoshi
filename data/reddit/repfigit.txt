It's very strange how RV-cash keeps yelling while he conflates that his hearing the sounds, "b-cash," is an insult then threatening not to participate. After rewinding many times, I actually don't think he's doing that intentionally. It really seems more of subconscious thing. It's almost like someone stole his brand one time.

Isn't lending done on some platforms? The basis of my original question was, how do we know the same coins aren't promised to multiple purchasers if transactions are done off-chain? Asking because I don't know.

If inter-bank transfers are off-chain, without proof of reserves, how do we know that isn't opening the door to fractional reserve banking?

So my good buddy Marcus made the original roller coaster guy image. His website is  Trivia question: What does Marcus, Erik Voorhees, the Harvey brothers - founders of Lamassu BATM, Bitcoin Belle, Stephanie Murphy, Amanda B. Johnson, (and myself) have in common? Hint. It's a political movement. Bonus question: Which radio show was the first on which Bitcoin was advertised, at the behest of Gavin Andresen?

This is legit. I donated btc myself and help with the charity. There are frn donations coming in as well. It's an all volunteer effort with no paid staff so 100% of donations go to the families. Watch the Facebook page for updates. The drive is happening this weekend.

Thank you for the explanation. It sounds as though the versioning decision isn't just a matter of having the code base "complete" and bug-free, but also how well the system fits into or thrives within its external environment, the wider world, without the need for further evolution. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's how I interpreted your response.

This ad is likely running on the radio show, freetalklive.com. The voiceover sounds the same as the voice on their intro. 150 stations is about their current reach. Make a better ad and run it there. Ad rates for the show are not prohibitively expensive. Ver is a long time supporter of the show.

Good analysis. I'm not a fan of CSW douche-baggery, however I do think too many people do not yet appreciate the precedent that was set by this move by virtue signalling exchanges to delist BSV. Regarding DEXs, Binance may have inadvertently undercut their credibility to build a trustworthy DEX. I believe that's the main purpose and selling point of BNB, is it not? It will be interesting to see how it plays out.

Peter Schiff gave a speech at Liberty Forum in 2012. Mind you, the event is put on by the Free State Project and is meant to inspire people to move to New Hampshire for more freedom. He kept talking about how we should move out of the country. I don't think he knew where he was.
