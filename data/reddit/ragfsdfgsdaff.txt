so, at what point in bitcoins adoption process are feelings like this supposed to stop? I mean, I understand it is exciting for you. Trust me, I get that. You live to watch the wild emotions of the marketplace swing back and forth, and you live to be a part of that mania. I've seen that a million times in a million different people. what I want to know is, when is this mania supposed to stop? I, along with every other rational person in the world, have no intention of putting my money into (or in other words, using in any way shape or form) something that is volatile, so wild, so unpredictable. at what point in bitcoin will these emotions level out so that bitcoin actually becomes a useable product instead of a gambling fix for traders and speculators?

and that is supposed to happen how exactly? oh right, its magic internet money, I forgot. 
the thing that sucks about bitcoin is there are several fatal flaws programmed into the economy itself but no one seems to care as long as the market is volatile and liquid enough to trade. 




very mature. spoken like a true speculator.

this is exactly why everyone thinks bitcoiners are morons; you have this unhealthy assumption that everything will just eventually work itself out. good luck with that, and enjoy your bitcoins.

that my friends is a load of fucking horseshit. ask ANYBODY with any amount of experience. you will lose everything if you bet on longshots 99% of the time. you will not be the 1% no  matter how bad you want it.
