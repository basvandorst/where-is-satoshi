Don’t forget to get your bitcoin cash.

I went through this same thought process a few years ago when BTC was ~$33.  I ended up buying them a ping-pong racket instead :-(

I am your OP.

Maybe you could offer some informal labor type of work for pay in BTC.

Aka HARO.  IMO, it's considered a legitimate, if sometimes bottom-feeding way to find journalists looking for a story if you're a subject-matter expert or source, and vice versa.  "Bottom-feeding" because lots of people and their PR firms hang around the rim there looking for opportunities for self-promotion and often try to squeeze that into story requests that might not be that relevant, and also because a lot of the reporters there are dumping lazy/last-minute/"urgent on deadline" requests looking for quotes that bend around an already-existing story or point of view.

On what exchange can you trade BTC on margin, short BTC, etc?  Are there calls, puts, and other derivatives?

Agreed, this is a good thing.

well at some point they'd want to be able to withdraw it, but not necessary to do that immediately.
