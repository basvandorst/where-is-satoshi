I made my son pay me in bitcoin for a haircut (usually free) just so he could say he got a $1k haircut one day:)

My stock broker sends them to me. Some are from in house research.  I enjoy them.

Don’t forget WS likes their privilege.  They like rules that only allow experienced investors to trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:59:23
Not sure about you, but I have spent a shitload of time learning about the tech and researching to find out if there was any economic reason behind the price movements. Research has paid off better with alts. Just buy bitcoin. A little bit,  twice a week or more now.

Antiques, art, first class travel, driver, chef. Who knows? Less than $100K at divorce to split.

This would be a cool gift for my son who turned 16 two days ago. He got me into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:49
What about transaction time? My son waited 12 hours for a btc transaction.

If each was around 5K EUR, then you were well under the trigger limits. Could be a way to avoid them.

My brother got a windfall of $10M once.  I never asked for anything. His money, his choice. He gave me $5K a couple years latter. I was happy. Sadly, he spent it all. But his house is paid off.

Draw a picture on the other side and give it to your mom. She will never throw it out!

Tell them you spent it on Cryptokitties. Then offer to sell them a gen0 for $500.

Jealous. My 15 year rate is 3.25. You did good!

If people mail USD to someone in Venezuela, can they exchange it for Bolivars?

This is the key.  Stock traders do the same thing. Sell bad stocks at a loss yearend to reduce their income. If you have a particularly bad shitcoin, you could sell it and use the loss to allow you to roll over that amount from a regular IRA to a Roth IRA. Never have to pay taxes on the money earned in a Roth:)

What did you do to get blocked? You catch more flies with honey.

Have to keep it under something like 1 btc if unverified, I thinkz

Have you contacted them on slack? That is what I did and my issue was resolved right away.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:13:15
Are you an slack with them? They got on my issue very quickly after I got on with them. Just have to watch the order they are working through problems. Get on it now before 5pm pacific time!
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:37:25
Can they switch to another coin if they are mining with ASICs? Or just the bitcoin clones, like litecoin, gold, cash?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:31
What about 30 days? Crazy whiplash these last 30.

I kept my dad’s xp laptop, and have windows 7  desktop because they have microsoft office that I own. Thus, I do not have to buy a license every year. But no one should do what I am doing or my MS stock won’t moon!

Hackers aim at your interaction with the coins and wallets or exchanges and your computer. People loose coins when their computers get hacked and qr codes or photos of keys are found on desktops or photo files.  Some have list them to phishing sites where they give their codes to the fake sites. As far as I know, no-one has had a private key hacked by an attack on the key itself. The key owner “ looses” it.
Exchanges hold the private keys to your coins on their exchange, so there is risk that they can be hacked and loose the keys for you.

I meant blocked from slack?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:54:57
Once I  submitted a ticket, they sent me an email with the slack invite. Be sure to check spam file.

Don’t use Bittrex, but I saw a post once that said if you use a password manager, it won’t let you sign in to a fake site. There would be no saved password to fill in.

I have the Nano S, and from what I understand, if I keep my bitcoin on it and wait out the chaos for a week or two after he forking, I should be OK. Community, please correct me if I am wrong.

When ether was spiking and diving, Coinbase was overwhelmed with transactions, and I could not transact!!

Yeah!! My one chance to belong in the 1%!! I would say Lambo, but I really want a new Volvo. 4x owner, favorite was the P1800:)

Americans and Canadians posting here I guess based on the time frame. So many discussions I look at are 10+ hours old. PNW dodging raindrops in WA.

Market price = value of item. It is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay for it.  I have neighbors who have been trying to sell their house, but no-one will pay them “what it is worth”.  Guess what? Not what you are asking!

Looking to be around Nov 16. All depends on how much time it takes to get to the block number 494,784. Fork is after. Should be mid Nov. Keep watching, and make sure your coins are in a compatible storage solution.

Satellites can be shot down. Given the provocation, I would expect they follow through.

Gold is commodity, Apple stock is investment.  Gold will never be more than it is= just hold. Apple has a chance to increase revenue and dividend based on how well it competes in the tech environment.  Crypto investment requires thinking in the same terms and looking for the technology that may disrupt the status quo. Why didn’t I buy Netflix and Amazon when I started using them? Could have paid for everything I bought from them and more!
