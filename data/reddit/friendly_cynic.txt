Before someone says gold: You never know when new tech or exploration will enable faster extraction of gold. Eg: Sailing and the discovery of a new continent (America. I imagine gold hodlers weren't happy about these news), new techniques and machinery for digging deeper, space travel and finding asteroids full of gold, etc.

Yes yes, but when speaking to the general public, using that definition of inflation would be stupid, unless you are a troll trying to make Bitcoin look bad to people who don't even know what any of the two inflations are. All of the known trolls have done this at some point, especially when replying to newcomers.
No one said Bitcoin's supply doesn't increase. But any time someone says Bitcoin fixes the inflation problem inherent to fiat currencies, trolls will "debunk" that by saying "Bitcoin actually has inflation! X coins mined per day!".
They will even go as far as saying that Bitcoin has more inflation than the USD (they intentionally compare apples to oranges: Bitcoin's monetary inflation to USD's price inflation).

The idea of Bitcoin is that you can choose to be in control of your coins. So normally you would buy the coins anywhere in small chunks and then send them to your own wallet. This is safe because transactions are not reversible, Bitcoin is like cash. So once they are in your wallet, the seller doesn't matter anymore.
A lot of people here trust Coinbase, Circle, etc. I prefer to buy in person using Localbitcoins or Mycelium local trader, for more privacy. You could also use an exchange like Kraken, which seems to be very good.

Trying to secure through code, something that is insecure in its design. Eg: Hacker finds a way to attack the coin, devs make some quick "fixes" that don't really fix anything. Hacker adapts his code to make it work again after those "fixes", devs make some more "fixes". This way the coin is 100% centralized because its security depends on its dev(s) being always vigilant and protecting the coin with temporary "fixes" all the time, that only add unnecessary complexity. If dev goes away, eventually the hacker will catch up and pwn the coin (but only if it's worth the hassle; most shitcoins are just too small).

They show themselves as supporters that just have some "concerns" and "valid criticism" to make, and will cry about some imagined "censorship". The truth is, if there is someone who cares about upvoting actual problems with Bitcoin (that have not already been discussed ad nauseam and/or solved), it's bitcoiners, because we want to fix them and make it the perfect currency. Trolls keep posting solved problems to try to paint Bitcoin in a bad light for newcomers.

Just because you can't see the connection it doesn't mean it's a "switch of arguments". Yes, PoS is insecure. Don't act like it's something I have to prove. You have to prove PoS is secure, because it's an extraordinary claim given there aren't any decentralized PoS coins, only centralized ones like Nxt and Peercoin. And no, a "paper" from your boy genius Vitalik isn't proof.
To sum up, Ethereum is even worse than Nxt.
