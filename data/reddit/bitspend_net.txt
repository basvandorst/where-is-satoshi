I will add each of those companies to the list of companies we are contacting.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:49:53
Someone is always here(with exceptions) until 11PM or later every night :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:09:00
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:03:56
No need to thank us, but we'll take it!
Can't wait to meet you guys some time next month when we come up to volunteer for a day with you getting all those meals out :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:47:32
We're not an exchange, we just let local people like yourself come by and buy Bitcoins from us ;) 
That being said, depending on your asking price, some of us will buy them personally. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:57:22


We haven't had a single order come in yet that we couldn't fulfill... so I would say you're right :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:52:38
You can already do this through the normal ordering process :)  However, there will also be a page on the new site dedicated to prepaid wireless, and easy ordering of said services.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:21:14
We would have helped you guys load your heavy furniture...

The drawing will take place at 8PM EST on Sunday, April 21st 2013. We will use randompicker.com to handle the drawing of the winner. We will use your order number as your entry-ticket, so that no personal information is used, and the drawing can be public.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:14:02
Orders that were placed after Midnight last night (12 hours ago) when the contest went live, are all entered.  
I will update the info to say that, my fault for leaving it out :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:48:13
This is part of what we currently have in the works :)
Stay tuned this month for news about our new features, coming very soon...
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:09:37
[This should help you out]( with the caps lock button that seems to be stuck.  Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:31:01
I just replied, your order is taken care of :)
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:24:41
We think we're pretty nifty :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:53:22
Email me at Justin you may have been one of the orders from last week when we had all the problems during the market crash.   Email me and I will personally resolve any issues you're having or get your order placed myself. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:55:36
Spam, Episode 2.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:04:07
You'd be surprised how many thousands have already ordered.  So far, I'd say we're earning the trust :)
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:02:56
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:28:43
1.  We have a public office, where anyone can stop by and meet the team(as well as verify the legitimacy of the company you send your Bitcoins too!)
2.  We have no order limits.  We have placed single orders upwards of $20,000 USD already.
3.  Our employees are all bound by NDA's and Confidentiality agreements and they only have access to your encrypted order data from computers in the office.  Whereas other people who opened shop after Bitspend(not bitsumo in particular, just in general) simply have guys sitting in their homes ordering for you when they get a chance to, using their own personal computers... no protection of your data.
4.  We were funded by the same people who have funded Bitpay, Coinsetter, Opencoin/Ripple, and other BTC based companies.  We have enough capital to handle any amount of orders you guys can throw at us, whereas these other companies are very limited and cannot handle either quantity or high value items.
When you think about it, what makes Chevron different than Shell or 7/11?  What makes Publix different from Winn-Dixie?  The services offered are the same when it comes down to the details (we allow you to order anything and pay with BTC, and so can anyone else that wants to), but we differ in the fact that we have already grown into a company and not just a couple guys in their homes.  We can handle large losses when the markets dip, whereas others cannot.  And as we have seen already when the last four companies opened up after Bitspend to do the same thing we do, none of them have lasted more than a week. 
Overall, **our service itself** differentiates us.  We pride ourselves on the way we treat you each as customers and will go out of our way to ensure that when your transaction is over, we have done everything we can to ensure your satisfaction.  
edit: I a sentence
edit2:  [And we're giving away a 32GB Nexus 7 to a customer this weekend!]( thought we'd mention it hehe :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:20:24
We're not an exchange or anything, but we do receive many BTC on a daily basis and are happy to provide anyone locally with a safe way to get them in person, in our offices :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:48:24
Or [just use us]( we place tons of Amazon orders every day :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:34:03
When we launch the feature we will have a full list of companies we know we can make payments for without issues.  If you do not see a company on there, you can request it and we will contact them to see if we can. 
Tmobile, Sprint, AT&amp;T, FP&amp;L, Boost, MetroPCS, Comcast, Time Warner, Local &amp; Regional "Utilities", are all examples of the types of bills we will have the ability to pay for you.  
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:45:04
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:05:24
There are a handful of you we seem to have issues in resolving, and for the life of me I can't figure out why.   I have taken back over in terms of customer support as of yesterday and am dealing with it all myself for now.   Email me at Justin and I will get you your btc refund tonight. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:57:25
We have ordered quite a few Steam games already, so if you're in need and want to pay with BTC just let us know :)
(ps, its [bitspend.net](
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:21:47
We ♥ you too!
(seriously, I remember using Bitinstant to buy my very first Bitcoin... when they were around $10, if only I had bought thousands of them!)
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:09:29
We didn't want to spam but we wont complain that you felt the need to share!
We thank you kind sir, for the x-post :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:55:01
This is actually something we have done many times already :)  The same people who have us cut a check for their rent/mortgage, have been begging for ways to pay other bills so we've been working on it.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:36:09
Let us know it is you, if you want, and we will wave your fee for the first order :)
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:45:17


We're sorry people using our service is annoying you, but we really like it when they do :)


Not really, since they are not having to "go out and sell" their BTC.  They are **paying** for their product in BTC, they do not exchange their BTC for something else of value and use that to pay(as per your example).  
To the customer, it is still only one step, one payment, just like any other method of payment would be or just as if the merchant took the BTC themselves(after which they would then simply sell them off for local currency anyways).
Either way, we're really sorry you have a dislike of our service. In the case you ever want to buy something with Bitcoins in the future and the merchant doesn't accept them, email justin and he says he will waive the fee for you :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:00:40
I'd just like to point out that it's .net ;) 
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:59:46
We like you. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:43:40
Shhhhh, don't tell anyone, but I am 100% positive [we can help :)](
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:49:42
As per the request to make it easier to add multiple items, what I will say is this... in a few days, you will be able to shop with Bitspend easier than ever before, and even easier than you're imagining in that cranium of yours as you read this :)
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:46:49
As far as ease of use, we think [we]( make it pretty darn easy to spend them on anything you want :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:01:13
**Buy ANYTHING you want**, just use [Bitspend]( :)
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:46:32


Directions please?
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:49:54
We're thinking of hosting a Bitcoin party at a local sports bar for a Heat game in the coming weeks.  If you're in South FL, hopefully you can stop by!
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:29:39
I'm glad you caught it, those purebreds are nigh impossible to get back in the bag!
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:35:27
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:32:15
I agree.  Even if you take out the fact that *we* are a part of this specific case, I still think more charities could do more good per unit of monetary value collected if they accepted Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:14:43
We're pretty darn hopeful too!
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:03:11
You may want to [check us out]( as we've got all that covered already :)
You can buy **anything** with Bitspend, and pay with BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:05:39
We are actually in talks with *brothels* and *services* where they are legal in NV.
We will be forming deals with them in the very near future which will allow their clients to pay via [Bitspend]( and keep the charges off their billing/credit history.  Providing them with a level of anonymity.
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:25:57
Thanks for the kind words, future customer :)
I also wanted to mention, customers will soon have a complete order status page which you will be able to find the tracking information for your item, if it is provided to us.  As well as be able to request any printable invoices in the case of a return or refund. [*Our super awesome head of secret stuff is almost done with his newest features, and ready to release them to the interwebz*]  
As for now, you can always email us to get an update on your tracking, as many of you already do!
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:35:08
What flavor cupcakes?
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:53:12
I guess we should let the girls over there know they can spend the Bitcoins they're bringing in, anywhere they want :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:03:49
Wow, we are just now seeing this!  
Let me try and cover it, however many people have already commented with the reasoning.
1.  We chose not to spend our investors money on a fancy office, and instead chose to use it to build Bitspend's service itself.
2.  We just moved into the office, and those "signs" were from the previous office tenant--ours did not arrive when you were here taking pictures.
3.  You didn't even knock to say hi!  How rude :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:01:28
Please email me at Justin and I will resolve your issues personally. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:44:41
And here we were thinking you actually wanted to pay that extra 13.5% :)
We are super happy you were satisfied with the service we provided you. As to your questions about our new system, the only thing not automated about it now is that we manually check to see if you will have to pay shipping for your order or not. 
Thanks for your trust and business, we love you!
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:11:08
We absolutely do :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:57:33
You can purchase **any** really awesome item(s) you want, with Bitcoins :)
[Just pay us a visit!](
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:27:58
And we would have ordered it for you ;) 
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:52:11
Sorry but we're actually in the office and have replied to any and all emails we have.  Are you sure you are contacting the right people?
Email justin or cade with your question--we're definitely not "MIA" or anything like that :)
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:30:55
We cannot tell you what was ordered, but we can tell you that in the last 10 days, over $30,000 in orders have been placed with Bitspend, all paid using Bitcoins...
So we can say with absolute certainty, people are spending their Bitcoins on whatever they want :)
(Using [us]( of course!)
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:10:52
It's coming :)
The Beta will be Chrome only, but when we push out the full release in the coming weeks it will be available for Chrome and FF.
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:30:43


As long as it is a Prime item, yes :)
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:49:20
We're in, hugs on the way!
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:19:38
As Redditedid said, we're on Sample and Dixie [750 East Sample Rd, Building 3, Suite 229]
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:05:51
I am sure this is welcome news for everyone there, considering the [recent events](  
Well done guys!
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:08:47
I'm sure [we could help]( :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:25:56
We heart you hard :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 02:39:40
Feel free to let us know what companies you have in mind for Bill-Pay so we can add them to our list of companies to contact :)
@_date: 2013-06-19 21:29:58
Multiple exchanges, all 100% verified.
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:37:48

Muhs is correct though, we can pre-order it for you, and you wouldn't be the first to pre-order it either hehe :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:59:10


We each hi5'd ourselves after reading your comment.  Thank you for that, we pride ourselves on it!
@_date: 2013-04-21 07:44:10
I guess you couldn't wait just a couple more days huh? 
I bet if you were to check back around the middle of the week, something eerily similar to that might magically appear :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 21:06:12
Yes ;) 
You can get anything you want (legal of course) through Bitspend. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:01:38


You can use wishlists with us, many people use pcpartspicker and send us their parts list, which we order :)
You can also use Newegg and get free 2 day shipping, or Amazon and get Prime prices and shipping.
As far as fees, for $2200 if ordered from one site(Amazon, for instance) then the total Bitspend fee would be $11.  I don't think $11 will hurt your budget :)
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:57:34
Whew!  We didn't make the list :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:34:42
We have done a whole heck of a lot more than _________ in sales on Amazon in the last month :)
(We order from them all day long!)
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:03:21
We also have a new feature coming shortly that will provide each Bitspend customer with an order status page that will provide your order and tracking  details. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:56:57
It doesn't matter to us!  We pay the retailer in **their** chosen currency, you simply pay us in BTC!
We have processed orders for customers all over the world already, some in places we'd never even heard of :)
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:36:22
As much as we appreciate our customers posting reviews, this one seems to have a negative effect on its viewers.
I can tell you with absolute certainty that no one here at Bitspend posted this. We have been very honest about our self-posts, and we are paying thousands for advertising... we would never post something like this.
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:58:47
If they do **not** ship twice as many, I will counter your offer with my own 0.5 BTC.  This way, people in need get a few meals regardless of BFL :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:53:29
Make sure you [add us]( to the directory :)
You know... please, and all that good stuff.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:25:40
Without running the actual numbers(which we are going to release at the end of the month), I can tell you that we have placed around $25,000 in Amazon orders so far this month, and that is a low estimate (I'm guessing using The Price is Right rules... I can't go over!).
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:55:38
We don't bite, I promise... give us a shot :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 05:00:42
I will add Xcel Energy to the list of companies to contact over the next few days.  
Also, we already have businesses who pay us in Bitcoins to pay some of their invoices for them.  Many of these shops accept bitcoin, and use us to order business supplies with them, or as mentioned, pay invoices for business goods/costs/etc.
When the new site launches, it will have a section going into more details about how a business who already accepts Bitcoins, can use us to order their business supplies and never have to cash out your Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:11:29
We understand your skepticism. However you will find many posts here on Reddit, as well as articles online of people who have used our service :)
Of course we use your data to place your order, via the link of the item you provide, so the merchant does still get your data just like they would if you order yourself. While we have your data it is stored encrypted, and only accessible to us when we are viewing it to place your order. We do not store data over 30 days after the "scheduled delivery" time of your product. You can choose to request a deletion of your data as soon as you receive your order or even right after we place it(but keep in mind this prevents us from providing you service as we will have no record of you).
(edit, some links to recent posts)

We would not consider that as *us sharing your data*, as you are specifically telling us to provide the merchant your shipping details to place an order for you :)  
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:54:09
Well, if you have any thoughts on how Bitspend can add to our services, to make the entire "use" of BTC easier--please let us know!
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:05:23
You are permitted to enter, as long as the alpaca in question has not been previously registered in any miniature alpaca showcases.

Yes, we use Amazon.de if that is where you want to order from.  We have placed many orders from there already, and on many other non-.com sites as well.  
It is your choice where you shop, we just help!

We added those as gifts...
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:00:24
I can't change the BTC price, but please leave a note when you order and let us know who you are and I will make sure we waive our Bitspend fee for your order, it's the least I can do.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:07:58
We plan on it!
We actually just made a "new hire" this weekend, a new Customer Service Genie(you guys will be meeting Crystal very soon!), to help us maintain the level of customer support we have been providing so far--as we continue to grow.  
Our top priority has always been and will always be maintaining our top-notch level of customer service.
Next time we are looking to hire in South FL we will make sure we let everyone know :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:04:55
Thank you for that.  We cannot control how long it takes for the office building to replace the signage in the lobby and on our door ;)

Recently, we have been selling them almost strictly on Coinbase, due to their awesome 48 hour ACH deposits(yeah, they say 5 days or so, but I always got mine 2 BD's after sale).
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:11:54
I apologize that you are having those issues.  We are always replying to anyone who contacts us.  I am not sure why you wouldn't have any replies from us.  If you would like, email me right now at justin and I will sit here and stare at my screen until I get an email from you.
We reply to hundreds and sometimes thousands of inquiries a day, so it is understandable if one falls through the cracks, but you mention contacting us on many levels so I am lost as to why you have not been helped.
Email me now, or even call us at the office (954.366.4111) and I will personally handle and resolve whatever the problem is, immediately.
[edit:  We just found your question posted to our subreddit in the "spam" box.  The answer to your question is **yes**, if you order a graphics card from Newegg(or anywhere) and it comes with a free Game Code, you **do** get that code as soon as we do.  We simply forward the email to you]
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:50:04
We are working on multiple credit card companies as well, so hopefully that will work for you.  I will add Elan to my list of companies to contact and see if we can make payment arrangements :)
