Yea it might make sense that there was another 100k+ in consulting fees / services? If so, then it would indicate that a lot of manual work has to go into setting up Chainalysis. Making me think the individual they're looking to audit with this software must be targeted to do the analysis.

Agree. I think the tumbler / chainanalysis would likely have to contain huge amounts of money? 
Also, I haven't seen any guides on how to store an xmr wallet similiar to how people use Electrum for btc There are xmr exchanges but nothing as user friendly, and I would agrue, as safe as Electrum.

Thanks for the comment. 
The invoice was only for about $13k, referenced in the article: 
This made me reread the quote: ** "*To date*, records show the IRS has paid Chainaylsis $88,700 since 2015 for its services." **
It would make sense then that each Chainalysis done would be a specific Subject/Target. At about ~$13k per investigation, that's 7 investigations where they would of aquired Chainalysis software. 
There are competitors I am sure. If they've been used at the same scale as Chainalysis, there are probably a few dozen examples of where the IRS has used targeted BlockChain Analysis software.

How effective do you think Tumblers will have been / are currently, in breaking up the blockchain trail?

Thanks for a great reply to this thread. One question on what you said here
"Chain analysis companies run Electrum servers. Long story short, finding a conneciton between your Electrum 1 client and Electrum 2 client is "easy peasy lemon squeezy", without any blockchain analysis. Not simply by Electrum's Stratum protocolblockchain.address.get_balancerequests, but also the IP you are broadcasting your transaction with."
On that last point, would TAILS mask the IP and other IDing factors being broadcast?
