What? It answers your question. Supply goes up, demand goes down, prices go down. It's economics 101. The graph explains it for you.

You are correct.

No, it's value is completely based on faith and trust. Why else would it's value be so volatile? Plus it's not a physical good. And one bad hard drive crash could cause it to be lost.

Silver has better industrial value
* More Sturdy
* More conductive
Gold is only good for tradition and trinkets.

The diamond market isn't accurate, considering its a monopoly/cartel. Diamonds are far from rare, and the prices are far from accurate.

Tell that to FDR and the American economy for the past 80 years. 
How many places accept Gold as an exchange for goods and services? If you answered "not many" than congratulations, Gold is an asset, albeit a liquid one.

Nope, Gold is a [terrible]( store of value. 
You must be thinking of bonds.

Do you mind sharing that definition? Because it was my understanding that Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts.
Do stock and bonds become money under that definition, too? What about livestock?

Oh darn, Gold was on the mind when I typed that, I meant silver hahaha
