I'm curious how you will transfer the coins into currency that can actually be spent.

Here for the giggles.

And you kind of summed up why bitcoin is a joke. That dollar bill in my wallet can still get me some Doritos at 7/11. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 12:25:16
Awesome. How do I pay my rent with that? 
@_date: 2015-05-22 05:58:19
WOOOTTT. Seriously if you want to run a business where you take peoples money don't act like a child. 
Just ignore it.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:44:50
Please elaborate. It seems like the opposite would be true. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:29:05
Serious question here.. Is all the money accounted for? Has all of it been seized? 
I wonder if the judge would take into account that if he was sentenced to 20 years and got out would he be sitting on millions from the crimes he committed. If that is a consideration he will get life.

There were directions posted on the site (from the staff) detailing how to get past detection by postal services. It is very clear that they knew what the site was being used for and that it was illegal. 
If ebay is was telling users to file off serial numbers before shipping goods then yeah, they should be accountable for facilitating the sale of stolen goods.

Shit like this is why people look at Bitcoin as a scam. Buy my magic internet wizard money on my advice so I make money and you lose a bunch.
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:18:30
As a person semi interested in bitcoin thinking I need to interpret this to spend money is a bit daunting. I have no clue what anything means. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:33:42
It is cool, but in the end I think it is going to be another scam. So maybe not the best thing to get excited about.

In Oregon our minimum wage is tied to the CPI.

Can you point me to a better source for info? And I am in no way saying I consider Reddit a good source for info. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 01:12:58
Awesome.. My landlord just started accepting sandwiches as currency.

"Draper is the third in a line of venture capitalists."
So like Trump. “He Woke up on 3rd Base and Thought He Hit a Triple”

I should totally get paid in bitcoin and pay my rent in it too. So, Currency or investment? Still waiting for a good answer. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:42:35
Now I feel safe getting my paycheck in this shit. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 12:13:00
Why is this something I should have to think about?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:35:36
Probably a article in Wired. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:45:51
At least you are honest. A asshole, but honest.
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:57:15
They have everything to do with his political views since he would shape policy. Those are big issues.

As a consumer I actually like PCI compliance. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:55:28
So did you have to set up all the crap for them to accept bitcoins? I'm sure that was better than moving on to the next job and earning actual money. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 18:03:27
It can be both at the same time.
@_date: 2015-03-14 12:28:31
This is a mess.. You are trying to sell him on something better. This isn't better when what they have used their entire life works perfectly fine. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 23:14:37
I wish it was desktop friendly.. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:09:11
Please spend the $1.6m on a security audit instead.  
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:34:34
This makes buying a bag of Doritos seem unnecessarily complicated. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 14:57:21
Because it is stupid to have another trial for a dude that will already die in prison. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:42:45
How do you deal with your paycheck? You could go through a check cashing place but the fees are bonkers. Or do you get your entire wage in BTC? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 05:50:26
Ebay doesn't mention on their site how to mask what you are mailing so you don't get arrested. Silkroad did.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:36:12
It is possible for both parties to be wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:15:23
Amen. I don't want my taxes going towards prosecuting Karpelès. Have your sandbox.
