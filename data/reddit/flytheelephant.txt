Supply hasnt even hit the market yet, we are already crashing.

Your welcome. Seems I was somewhat right, but the extremity of the event is less than what I had expected.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:04:17
Probably right. But I believe in crypto so much that crypto markets should learn that they do not need bitcoin. If everyone trusted crypto, there would be no need to sell to fiat. There would be no market cap loss during failures of bitcoin, which will likely continue for eternity.

That was months ago.

I got the banker who was processing my wire transaction into bitcoin last time. He made me write out a whole sheet on what places to go to and stuff.
Fuckin true story. this was when it was at 2200 before it hit 3000.
I was like bitcoin is gonna go from 2200 to 3000 quick and crash.

So: basically what op is saying is that he wants to use monero.

Yea this is the correct way to build a steering wheel on an electronically controlled steering system. or a 1 turn Lock to Lock direct ratio steering box.

Agreed ascetica, Only talk about Litecoin, the replacement for bitcoin here. Litecoin was founded to fix bitcoin's scaling issues which would ARISE CHIKUN!

^ This guy doesn't have enough litecoin.

My best guess, bitcoin crashes, 1800 or lower over the next three days. Jihan resumes his btc ddos the block before the fork hits. Nobody can get their coins into exchange fast enough to dump them. Transactions lay unconfirmed for days. Alts raise compared to bitcoin (maybe not in dollar terms, but maybe.) Everyone dumps BCC on the first second and jihan scoops it up. Once jihan gets his dirty coins, he bip148s his own coin activating segwit with his already 8mb blocks then sells our coins back to us.
Sure we can rest under the impression that dumping BCC will kill BCC, but will it? Or will jihan singlehandedly prop up the mining and node operations of BCC and ddos bitcoin into oblivion until he either wins in dominance or goes bankrupt.

I am ready for charlie lee to have my babies.

Litecoin for sure. If you own only one coin, make it the Rising Chikun.
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:46:35
Yes thats what the bitcoins that coinbase has stored for you look like.

America was a fork combining the strengths of the iriquois confederacy (Alliance of free states), the roman republic (Constitution and seperation of powers and hedge against the evils of democracy), and british liberty (magna carta).
War of northern agression was a malicious hard fork which irreperably replaced our american form of government with a garbage one.

Nigerian ICO scams are definately the pinnacle of market forces redirecting funds from the weak to the strong.

He solved the problems in which bitcoin has too small of a block, too weak of encryption, and too slow of a block time.

There is no justice. This would just fuck everyone. You cant have justice you fucking idiot. Government wants to fuck you and all of us.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:55:56
Should people report lost bitcoins to the government too? Do I have to report the 60 bitcoin that were goxxed? No I don't none of the bitcoins are mine, I just control them (but not the goxxed ones)
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:52:39
Go ahead, read it, It isn't that long.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:54:34
You dont own bitcoins. You have keys to it. Bitcoins all belong to the network. Nobody owns them. They belong to the network.

There are no laws lag. We are in a lawless society. The constitution is the foundation of law, and it isn't followed by the government.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:44:18
Maybe you should read the constitution if you think they are following it.

Don't give them any ideas poker. They will start shoving probes in our heads if they realize they can.

I think its just short staffing and aml compliance. They also have issues when they need to change wallets. Imagine the management nightmare handling 60-100 currencies and automating that must be.

99.8% of them go in this bag we are talking about. I guess it is possible to have a legitimate product come from an ICO.

Yep the handle a lot of coins. They are the volume king for many of them. They make shitloads of money, I wish they would use some of it to hire people.

Yea, why do you take financial advice from women who are not your wife?

Slavery was outlawed in 1813. Ownership of slaves was banned after the civil war and replaced with contract slavery. ownership of contract slaves was outlawed and replaced with debt slavery in 1913. Slavery never ends, it just changes forms.
