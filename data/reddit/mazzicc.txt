They don't audit transactions, they audit you. When they audit you, they make you provide the transaction history, and if you didn't report gains, you can be in trouble. 
It is very cumbersome and is the same as it is with stocks and other investments. If you move your money frequently, it's harder to manage. 
You have to assess the risk of not properly filing your taxes, because the IRS has 7 years to decide to audit you or not, so just because you don't get a notice this year doesn't mean they won't come after you. Most audits are for suspicious activity, but a certain percentage are randomly assigned.

No, Coinbase has private insurance for its coins, and insures your cash through FDIC up to 250k. Those are separate as FDIC would not cover your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:34:35
Coinbase has insurance, but there's no telling how those payouts would work or how long it would take. It's possible that it would take months and only pay you back the cash value at the time it was stolen, and not the current value.

Do you know how much you gained in value? If so it's pretty basic to declare capital gains, and pay on that amount. 
As others have said, use a program or company that offers audit support or insurance, keep copies of *everything* you can find related to the transactions, and then probably don't worry because the amount is so small your audit risk is low. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:33:55
This is the exact way to look at it.

Bitcoin must be exchanged to have value. If no one was willing to give up any bitcoin at any cost, it would  crash, which is why we see people selling at different points. 
The hold argument doesn't make sense as holding something without ever spending or exchanging it provides no value. What makes sense is "hold until you need to spend", which is like saying "save your money until you need to spend". It's basic financial responsibility.

If no one is willing to buy your stock, it has no value, even if the underlying company is succeeding. 
A kilogram of gold has no value if no one will buy it either. Someone has to be willing to pay or barter for something for it to have value.

I don't understand. Your bank account cannot hold bitcoin.
 If your bitcoin is in a private wallet, you can spend them from that wallet, or send to any exchange you choose to sell. 
If your bitcoin is on Coinbase, you can spend it from there or sell it, but if Coinbase is hacked, your coins could be stolen without your control.

US tax rules:
In your scenario, let's say you bought 1btc for 1000, and it became worth 3000 (2000 gain), so you sold 0.33btc to take out 1000 back. 
You would calculate your gain as 0.33 btc bought at 333, and sold at 1000, so you owe gains tax on the 667 gain. Assuming 15% tax, you owe 100.05 in taxes.

How would using bitcoin prove capitalism is evil? "Buying and selling this is evil, so I'll use this other currency to do it"?
How would selling out of a large volume of bitcoin, lowering the value of bitcoin, damage capitalism? It would damage bitcoin as people abandon it. 
Are you suggesting NK would try to use bitcoin against the capitalist countries? How would that work? 
Despite the anarchy claims of some fanatics here, bitcoin is not a treat to the way the world works. It's just another currency that currently avoids existing currency regulations that have been developed over time for the betterment of society. 
It's not as anonymous as people think, and governments can and will regulate it as it becomes a significant concern. That concern is in the form of people risking their wealth and losing it, or attempting to avoid taxes, not in its mere existence or use.

Why not? It's literally where everything gets its value. Every item you own is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. 
If you had a kilogram brick of gold but no one wanted to buy it, it would be worthless.

US taxes: 
You bought 1 btc for $1000. Btc rose to $10,000, so you sold 0.1btc for $1000.
You owe gains on the 0.1btc you bought for $100 and sold for $1000, a $900 gain. Assuming 15% capital gains, that's $135 in taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:55
What you're not getting is that Market capitalization is essentially a meaningless number that just lets you compare sizes of two things when the smaller units are different sizes. 
It comes from stock. Just because Company A stock is $100 doesn't mean the company is worth more than Company B stock at $10. If A only has 10 shares, but B has 10,000, the total size of A is $1000, but B is $100,000. 
Similarly with crypto, just replace Company A and B with Crypto A and B, and shares with coins in circulation.   
Market cap is derived from share value by definition.

I can't speak to EU, but if it's similar, here is how the US works:
You buy 1btc for 100. Btc goes to 1000. You sell 0.1btc for 100. 
You pay gains on the 0.1btc you bought for 10 and sold at 100 for a gain of 90.

You can't write it off. You write it off when an investment decreases in value, not when it's stolen. 
You can report it as stolen and the cops will do the same as if it was stolen cash "that sucks, sorry". You don't get a tax write off because your money was stolen, you just attempt to get the system to return it. 
As I said in the other apparently deleted post, if I made a million dollars on the stock market and it was all stolen, the IRS would still come to me and ask for the gains on that million dollars.

As I read it, you don't have to have a LOT of trust in one single entity that can break that trust, instead you need lots of little trust, almost no trust at all, in lots of entities with no incentive to break that trust. And even if some of them do, the trust in the rest outweighs them.

I don't know the details, but my understanding is you can duplicate the magnetic stripe if you have the relevant card info such as cc expiration, name, and cvv. I would imagine you have to know how the different companies format it, but you can get a magnetic read/write machine and run your own card to determine that
Edit: part of why I know this is one of the times my card was stolen, the CC company told me it was physically run at a store in another state, when I had the card in my hand. They said it's possible that the thief duplicated it because they had my info. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:54:27

In the US, you pay capital gains on any appreciation in value, even small ones. Technically there is a lower threshold, but I believe that's under $100.
For example, I have stock investments that have only gone up by $200-300 when I sold, and I paid capital gains taxes on them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:24:31
What do you think "a lot" is? 
I'm perfectly comfortable in my job too, and BTC has always been pure speculation for me. I've been holding a handful of coins for years because I broke even on money invested vs. money extracted back in 2012 or so, and have just been sitting on them since. 
With the big rise this year, I told myself I'd sell 1 at 10,000 (which I just did), and then hold the next until 50,000 (not sure my next milestone after that). If it craters to 0, I still made a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:29:01

Look at BTC investments like retirement investments. At age 25 you can afford to have your entire 401k in high-risk stocks. As you get to age 55, you better have moved some of that into lower-risk assets.

Paying your taxes in bitcoin? Is that an option?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:15:15
I know that is incorrect. Any transaction in bitcoin reflects a change in the value of it and affects capital gains or losses. Even buying a cup of coffee in bitcoin is something you would have to technically pay capital gains on, but your odds of being caught are much smaller.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:13:43
Could you explain how to document your transactions for LIFO/FIFO/Select Lots? How do you choose which "coins" you're selling to minimize taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:36
As I understand it, and I could be wrong but I don't think I am, your example would work like so (numbers simplified for example):
I have $10,000 and I go exchange that for 8,400 Euro
I spend 4,200 Euro, and come home.
I buy a car worth $10,000 from a dealer willing to be paid in 4,200 Euro.
I would owe capital gains on the $5,000 increase in value of those Euro (I bought Euro at 1=0.84, and sold at 1=0,42) 
Most people don't bother on small amounts, because it's not worth the IRS's time to come after you for $300 or $400 in capital gains that went unreported. It's also hard to document.
What I'm not sure about is if the $10k I just sold and the ~$1500 in taxes I owe on it (15% long term capital gains) is enough that I should be concerned. It seems pretty small to me in the grand scheme of major money exchanges and gains, but the $10,000 transaction was big enough to hit banking limits.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:14
There might be programs out there available for young people filing taxes for the first time that you may be able to consult an expert who can tell you if there's a simple way to document it or not. 
If you're using a simple first-in-first-out method, the calculations aren't hard, just tedious. If you've always used the same exchange in one direction or the other, it shouldn't be too difficult to get a copy of all your transactions and use those for the needed calculations. 
Basically (I would suggest reading on this in more detail, I may be oversimplifying) if you've sold 0.1 bitcoin for the first time, you go look for the transaction(s) that gave you the initial 0.1 bitcoin, and use that as your cost basis for gains. if you sell another 0.1, you repeat. If multiple transactions all together were your first 0.1 (0.05 and 0.05) you would take the average cost of those transactions as the cost basis.
I am not an expert, so please don't take my word as final, but I believe the core of what I've said is accurate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:34
My understanding from what I've read is you technically should record gains whenever you exchange it for anything of value. Even buying something for bitcoin is registering some form of gains because the coins you used appreciated in value. I would guess most people actually only pay gains when they exchange for cash.
You are taxed only on the gain in value. If you bought at $9000 and sold at $10,000, you would pay capital gains taxes on $1000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:58
How do you document the "coins" sold to justify it as FIFO?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:41
What is sizeable? I literally sold $10k worth because that was the benchmark I set for myself when it hit $3k. I'm trying to decide if that is enough to justify paying someone to help me out with a single transaction. 
I'm perfectly comfortable handling all my other capital gains filings for stocks and other standard investments. I just don't want this one thing to bite me in the ass.
Edit: I'm perfectly happy giving the IRS their cut. They can only tax me on the money I made, so I still am at a net gain, even after taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:11
Thanks, that's sort of the feel I'm getting so far. It looks like its as simple as saying "I have additional capital gains on $10,000, here is the $1,500 in taxes I owe".
Other than this transaction, I'm still a small fry to the IRS and not likely to be audited.
Edit: I also believe that the vast majority of people in crypto are not paying taxes. My fear though is that people are finally starting to have enough capital gains from it that it's going to start getting caught soon. The reputable exchanges have to report large transactions to the government, so it's not too hard to believe that there might be a department, however small, dedicated to giving an extra bit of scrutiny to those larger transactions.

Full disclaimer, I could be misinformed, but I'm fairly confident that is correct. If you have any tax concerns, consult an expert. I created this discussion to try and get feedback and see if I'm comfortable enough to just report this on my own, or if I feel I should get an expert. This is the first time I've ever "spent" bitcoins.
