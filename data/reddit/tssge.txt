Yup, can confirm. Tried to sync a full ETH node and was unable to do so. I used 40 hours with 300 Mbps connection trying to sync, but there just weren't enough peers with enough bandwidth so I could get into sync.
It seemed that blocks were appearing just a few percent faster than I was able to sync them, so I just quit. It seemed hopeless.

Yes, but still Ethereum does not scale. There's some amount of transactions that will halt the network. I've seen this multiple times when buying on Ethercraft and saw this during Cryptokitties.
Had to put some crazy 40 gwei in order to get my transaction through.

Visa cancelled all Wavecrest cards. Not just crypto. That's why I think it's something Wavecrest did, like broke their terms or something big instead of just issuing crypto cards.

Depends on the country you're obliged to pay taxes to.

Bitpay probably hasn't announced it yet. The announcement I got via email was from Wavecrest.

Bitpay card is also affected.

Kucoin is always down. Already lost some money there because of downtime. Can't really recommend Kucoin.

Have they announced the name of new issuer anywhere?

I don't know about this particular picture, but these adverts are everywhere. There's less distance to the nearest Bitcoin ATM than to a fiat ATM for me.

Yes, I am using a middleman. Unable to handle CC payments and their requirements myself as this would cost me far more than what I am currently paying.
A lot of companies use the same payment processor. Haven't heard of anyone really processing their own CC payments. It's such a huge risk and cost, even though the fees themselves are lower.

Well, even SEPA transfers cost 0,13€ with valid SEPA reference number and 0,50€ with a message in my Finnish bank, paid by the receiver. Sending them costs also, 0,20€ per sent payment for the sender. I consider SEPA transfers to be the cheapest way to transfer money in Europe currently.
Of course, these costs do not usually apply to people, but companies. Normal people do not see these costs, nor are they usually even aware of them. But someone has to pay for this infrastructure and these people pay them in product prices, banking fees etc. You can't draw some arbitrary number of money out of an unknown void, I mean if I were able to do so I'd be filthy rich.
Do note, that someone has to pay for the WeChat infrastructure as well. They pay it via taxes or other hidden mechanisms built into the society. Or maybe companies use the same infrastructure and they have to pay for it. I am not familiar with China's WeChat myself.
Yes, you can send Paypal gifts for free. But the companies, such as mine, will pay for that infrastructure used for the gifts with the 3,4% + 0,35€ fee on every payment. These fees are used to keep up the infrastructure needed for the processing of such gifts. Paypal is even known to ban people from their service, if they abuse the gifting feature.
One thing in which Bitcoin shines: it is one of the only methods of transfering money that can be bought from an ATM and used on the internet, it's like our fiat in reverse! Yes, the idea of buying an internet currency with cash is revolutionary to many kids and people with no credit. Usually the alternative is paysafecard which incurs 14% costs. That's next to nothing compared to Bitcoin.

What additional fee on top of that?
When my company processes Bitcoin transactions, only the transaction fee to the network needs to be paid. I don't see what would cost extra with this process, if the customer just sends his Bitcoins to my company's wallet.

Well, actually...
Being an entrepreneur myself, a card transaction costs me 2% + 0,35€ per payment and a flat fee of 59€/month (exclusive of VAT).
A Paypal transaction costs me 3,4% + 0,35€ per payment.
A company has to make that money somehow, so it must be included in prices, meaning that ultimately it is you who pays the price. It's just that the price is well hidden and transparent to you.
Bitcoin costs me nothing, but costs the client the current transaction fees of the network for his payment.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:19:50
No it's not. I mean when compared to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:54:00
I understand that it is frustrating that a company would not "subtract" this fee from your bill like for other payment methods. And I completely agree that this makes Bitcoin a bad payment method in such situations.
My point is that this is not a problem with the fee itself being high, but rather with the company handling only one payment method in a special way and "adding" this fee on top of your payment.
Thus, meaning that 28 cents is not a large fee compared to the competition, however how Bitcoin is usually handled by companies is bad for the consumer.
This means that the problem does not reside with the 28 cent fee being too high, but rather in the process how these companies handle cryptocurrency payments. We should work towards changing this process.
For my company, I add the fee on top of every payment method. I think that this is very fair for my customers, as they have the choice of selecting the payment method that is the most inexpensive for them.

It's included in the price and paid by the company you buy your products from, making the fee transparent to you. That does not mean it doesn't exist.
How do you think Visa and others make money? That's how.

Actually few percents is quite stable when compared to fiat. Check this our for example: 
And these are the two currencies I consider one of the most stable. The weekly deviation seems to be around 2%.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:28:33
I agree that you'd need to look at the yearly average.
The thing is though that +-2% fluctuation per week wouldn't probably be a 104% change in a year because that would require every week for the price to fluctuate in the same direction. Then it would not really be fluctuation would it?
But still, +-2% per week is stable. At least stable enough, because we are currently using it.
