Exactly. This chinese new year theory is bullshit.

I was being sarcastic. Some people are posting fake charts.

If we look deep inside ourselves, aren't we all satoshis?

Let's say it's not backed. Then won't the exchanges just take tether out of their exchange. They do hold some tether so they'll lose that probably which might amount to few million dollars, right?

But every exchange trades in tether. How would having a btc-tether pair affect anyone?

I do agree the trading volume has to be a lot higher. It's a new currency. So, the low volume is obvious. Also, the same could be said about withdrawing dollar from banks. If everyone withdraws at the same time, the banks do not have that cash to give the people. So, does that make dollar worthless? Also, Bitcoin being accepted on taxation and as a national currency is the end goal. It's just that it's hard to unseat the dollar right now but time will come when a major depression occurs and Bitcoin will look good as an alternative.

This app uses blockchain to create a digital identity on the blockchain using the person's email id, phone number which is exactly what crypto is against. Using blockchain just for VC money, I presume.

Can somebody explain to me how this would be possible? Isn't the wallet file encrypted?

But can you send your pubes to another country in seconds?

Are you a vegan?
@_date: 2018-07-02 10:13:41
I would like to purchase 10 pubes for a dollar each then.

If he is not a vegan then he is a much bigger threat to global warming. I'm a vegan so I don't contribute to global warming by eating meat. I do mine though but all of the electricity my city gets is generated by a dam.
