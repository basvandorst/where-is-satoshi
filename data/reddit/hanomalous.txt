They've known about the timing side channels from the beginning. It was a design choice not to care about them.
In practice attacker still needs to know PIN and physical proximity to device to be able to obtain trace to exploit the side channel.
Also, fixing secp256k1 timing is not trivial. I don't know if any implementation ever is actually free of them. There are better implementations, but secp256k1 is complex enough that it's extremely hard to write it without timing channels.

Pull request 1 is me and I wasn't asked, for the record. Not sure there would be much point in objecting - except as a form of protest.

It's kind of hard to connect all measuring equipment you need for SPA/DPA and expect the user not to notice. For instance, [look how it was done for Yubikey]( (pdf).

Actually it is. Montgomery and Edwards cuves like Curve25519 and Curve41417 have laddering algorithms available for scalar multiplication. This makes curve operations much easier to implement in constant time. Secp256k1 on the other hand has several special cases that need to be handled.


You can measure time on the compromised PC, but in such case you'd need many signatures to be measured, one would not be nearly enough.
