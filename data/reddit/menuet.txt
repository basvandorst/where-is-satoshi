That's a marketing perspective not a consumer perspective. Although any kind of incentive would be nice, I just have to let you know you're confusing the new marketing trend of believing that you can diminish the value of a product by ever reducing its sticker price and that it is better to incentivize promotions with more product rather than lower price. That's the marketing side.
But in any case, people should demand more SOMETHING for dropping coin. Remember that because of Bitpay and other merchant processors, merchants lose NOTHING and gain a LOT for us to have to risk holding and using Bitcoin for their products and services.

I agree with you. There isn't enough tech industry talent in finance to justify understanding easy business models or market conditions for these kind of valuations. They're just looking at other people and making the same bets.
It will crash, surely so, but no need to blame anything but cheap money that only gets handed to banks first. I mean, if you were an investor given $1 million a day, how would you handle it?

A firm that profits is an incentive for other firms to enter the industry. It is a market signal that an industry's customers are under-served. An *industry's* customers, not a firm's customers.
Industries that have the highest average profits are new industries that do not suffer much competitive proliferation. However, industries like food have profits that approach zero.
There is a difference between accounting profit and economic profit. Accounting profit is what a business owner can afford to bear in relation to a firm he owns. Economic profit is what a business owner can afford to bear in relation to opportunities he has forgone at the expense of pursuing a firm in a given industry.
I went ahead and proofread that for you because I know when English is your second language it gets a little rough to digest things that are slightly messed up.

Why do people keep treating Bitcoin like a stock? It's not a stock. It's a currency. Its goal is not to produce profit. Its goal is to be used as a medium of exchange.
If you want to draw parallels, think about what causes Forex markets to move. It's about capital investment. In my opinion, anonymity is the initial "government" or "state" that sponsors Bitcoin. So, fundamentally, the more necessary a growth in the market for anonymity, the more interest in Bitcoin.
Most of Bitcoin businesses deal with online anonymity and circumvention of legal issues on the trade of goods and services. The bigger this market, the more Bitcoin is worth.

Since PayPal is functionally peerless, I doubt that its price is anywhere near marginal cost.

Him saying you could do whatever you want wasn't legitimate enough for you? Sheesh.

What does this mean? Do you have anarcho leanings, or are you just kinda interested in seeing what it could bring about?

I have a negative PayPal balance, also. Does this ever affect your credit? What can I do about it other than try to pay it off? What are the consequences of it remaining outstanding?

Relax. I, for one, am very happy that Bitcoin is spreading some entrepreneurial spirit around. Let's not mistake laws for morals.

So, BitPay sends a confirmation when the order goes through? Is this why people tend to use the API or carts? I'm trying to email a provider some information when the payment goes through.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:22:58
I don't think so. The point would be to get it to one base number so you can more easily compare versus 300mbtc 2752ubtc 0.0000034 btc jesus.

Banking is not a free market. It's a coerced cartel. It's too bad because there's a lot of wealth in this world looking to move and grow freely.

Well, people are always monitoring the blockchain, so I don't think it has happened yet.

There's no legal or even official structure promising future profits. How the hell does someone choose to "invest" in something like that? In hindsight, I can see that mass adoption without the necessary exchange infrastructure really is a bubble. I hope the property managers renting in BTC are still going to do it.

I came just a little.

You are not alone. Many people have said nearly the same thing to me.

I agree with you, but Snake is trying to talk about how the exchanges and public figures are just cashing in on bubbles. While he's saying exchanges need to be regulated, I'm saying exchanges need to be phased out by market pressure.

To be fair, some of these countries are VERY poor. But think about how messed up the system is that all this money is fiat and there are definite losers... Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are going to change everything. Bitcoin, guns, land, and a gold hedge, baby.

TLDR: Depreciating currencies are spent on the best or most essential goods. This economy needs to start with housing, food, utilities, clothing.

You're making complete sense. And merchants have nothing but incentive to take Bitcoin! It can't be charged back, and BitPay is better than any other method of USD transaction! Awesome!

I agree. Here's the fundamental truth: the best investment is only ever THE BEST INVESTMENT. You can consider paying off debt an investment, but you generally need to have better options on the table when you truly care about making money and getting ahead.
@_date: 2013-04-14 01:02:08
No. If the market demands this, it will be handled through 3rd parties. Bitcoin itself doesn't need to be burdened with more things. A simple protocol is better.

I'm just wondering what the point would be of using it as a currency versus fiat if you're not trying to evade the law in some way.

Is that the truth? I believe a wire incurs a fee from my credit union, something akin to 30 dollars. Unless ACH IS a wire. Then yeah, it should be fine!

Intermediaries. Ya'll act like Visa IS the USD. The biggest win for Bitcoin is that it won't inflate except at a predetermined rate. It's a macro-benefit. It's not a micro benefit. Yes, the microbenefit is pseudoanonymity, but then again, that's not really anonymous all that much either. So zerocoin or something similar needs to fix it. And then intermediaries need to come in to offer services like the cards do.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:27:01
Is it because you feel like no matter what you have some wealth on you?

We're all "late adopters" to the USD or gold or any other currency on Earth. We don't think of that as something that matters. The amount of value that you can create with your brain and your body is the only thing that matters in the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:33:06
I agree with you, and no offense, the amount of down votes our understanding is getting just makes me feel like people here really don't understand finance...

So you just saw Bitcoin as an investment vehicle?
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:10:39
I was thinking about this myself. With the business I am starting offering online SEO services, I think I will fix the price in coins. However, if it swings greater than 50# that's really difficult to deal with.
If the dollar changed in worth by 25%, prices in fiat America would change except for a few massive corporations who may try to weather the storm in a loss scenario with the assumption the value would return in a short period.

But in the near-term, more people involved in Bitcoin see it as an intermediary USD holding. This is something that could theoretically happen very soon, and there'd be a lot of incentive on the table with the 2 bil market cap at present.

Regardless, lots of businesses read these articles. It'll push more transactions into the blockchain. Good things are coming.

How are you implementing Bitcoin? BitPay or no?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:22:01
Huh? The part about Bitcoin that's centralized is its point of failure: the exchanges. The part about Bitcoin that's decentralized, it's value as a currency, has never been stronger...

@_date: 2013-04-12 12:19:55
This is the truth. Bitcoin has only sucked for speculators.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:19:25
I'm just saying that with BitPay you offer two options and one easy setup for a payment processor at the BitPay site. Buyers still get that protection because they can renege on payments to BitPay.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:53:05
Can you buy gold with that?
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:57:02
Thumbs up for your opinion. But why would the government have created a reserve note monopoly in the first place if it did not intend to keep it? Do you really feel that Bitcoin bodes well in a legal sense?
I think that's my major point. If people care about "the law," the law necessarily BANS the use of Bitcoin outright. A competing currency is not something the existing structure would like to see.
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:24:54
I think that a form of cryptocurrency, whether Bitcoin or not, will eventually replace everything else. It seems to me the most sensible solution we have available to a civilizations-old problem.
@_date: 2013-08-15 10:45:37
I need to remain more optimistic than that. And better yet, more realistic.
Every small business needs to understand how to use bitcoin on the side, like for customers who smile and ask to use it. They can't break it this easily.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:37:08
Do hacked computers really help to secure Bitcoin if they become the majority and do not implement forked updates?
@_date: 2013-07-21 12:57:36
Yes. Others have argued the merits of deflation. Overall, I'd say it just results in a healthier economy where savings matters and your ideas need to be better to get funded. More prudence and more money, son.

Haha. Any link?

As long as we still believe in liberty to some degree, money will always be useful to delegate human time. Just because we can all eat and live comfortably in a futuristic standard of living for no cost does not mean that creativity would cease having a cost.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:54:54
I agree with you just based on the fact that it's somewhat difficult to attain Bitcoin. But that's based on the system anyway. It's because it's being recognized as a currency. If it were just a beanie baby, this shit wouldn't matter.
But honestly, this will matter less when there is a self-sustaining Bitcoin economy. That's what we are looking for. And this has to be decoupled from other currencies except through regular market forces.
We need to get major property managers to accept Bitcoin in an area, and then all the Bitcoin users can move there and create a little community. But then that may not work because there will always be foreign intervention into the currency. Hmm. Bitsy is hard.

Integrating with Paypal is integrating with the fiat monetary system. That alone adds a whole bunch of cost except to those who suck its dick the hardest (banks, Visa, etc). Those other things you mentioned are freely available. Check out [BitPay](
