"Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the U.S. (and the world, for that matter), despite past gifts of more than $28 billion to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He bolstered his foundation's efforts to eradicate polio in April, securing $335 million in pledges to the cause from six billionaire comrades, including $100 million each from Mexico's Carlos Slim and New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Shares of Microsoft jumped in late August on news that Steve Ballmer will step down as CEO; Gates will remain chairman of the software company. He and Warren Buffett have thus far convinced over 100 of the super rich to sign on to the Giving Pledge, a promise to donate at least half one's net worth to charity."

Think there still looking into it cant read Japanese so have to use google, but here is a story form like 13 days ago 
"In addition, corresponding to the bit coin of Japan and speaking, when Haruhiko Kuroda President of the Bank of Japan was asked about bit coins in place of the press conference, " the statement and to have a great interest " has been, Bank of Japan it is a study and research in the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies has been found, but it does not become clear in the still or is in a position of negative-positive one."
Not about Japanese gov. but there bank talking about it. I would think there stance will be the same as the USA. Soon as Japanese get that BTC are like cash in many ways. A ton of them will use them. Japanese don't like to use credit cards if it still the same as when i study there. At lest it will would work great for the trains as a way to pay for the pass. Think it would work great with the Suica card. Suica card is a prepaid train pass that if you don't have you waste a lot of time buying the passes for the trains also it works at other places like fast-food and convenience stores. 
This is off info form when i study there for a year. That was 4 years ago so may be a bit out of date. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:08:31

With how solar works it be hard to give you a good estimate without more info. 50 panels sould be about a 14KW system what is a good size one. That if your using the 325w panels with OK roof conditions. The main key to home solar is what you get form net metering. The energy you sell at peck hours give you more energy credits then you use at off peck hours, but form the size of your system it looks like maybe the people who sold you the solar did not get how net metering works, and end up over building it. If your in the USA look up the law in your sate also because in some the power company has to pay for your energy credits at the end of the year. At the same rate they buy it for at wholesale what is about $0.04 a KWh.

You need to pay a lot to buy it or have very good credit to get the loan or one of the programs. Also will need to have the room to put all the solar panels you will need. A lot of it goes off where you live. I used to sell solar panels for 3 years. It sould save you a lot of money on the energy cost, but cant say how will it work without more information.

We may need to add a rule to that if you post about Bitcoins being stolen.

You sould use 2 wallets 1 that is your hot wallet the other your cold storage. A hot wallet is like your checking where a cold storage is like your saving. A hot wallet if you get hack the private key can get stolen therefor your Bitcoin can get stolen. A cold storage wallet the private key are save offline so you need physical access to it to get the private keys. What is a lot saver then keeping them online.   
I use armory myself using a guide like this to make cold storage. 
Also this looks like a good way to make paper wallet just not out yet.

"I'm very sorry for the difficulty! In order to accommodate a larger number of transactions on the site, we're currently in the process of pulling from offline cold storage to replenish bitcoin stored on our servers. During this time, it's possible that some newly created transactions may remain in a "pending" state for longer than normal. If the bitcoin transaction is not successfully confirmed by the network after 24 hours, a system check will automatically cancel it and return the bitcoins to your account."
