@_date: 2017-08-29 22:39:44
Hold your BTC don't spend them on drugs.
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:08:07

@_date: 2017-08-04 05:51:46

@_date: 2017-08-16 19:23:12

@_date: 2017-08-12 17:35:52
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:22:39
spent multiple BTC on bunk anti anxiety meds... lost 1.3 to faucets ( biitcoin brain when 5 days old and Gladiacoin when about 1 month old...) regret!
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:32:44
lots of times! I just regret not buyiing those coins right back... I have some antianxiety RC's that are worth 10X less now because I didn't replenish my BTC.. so many lost BTC from 150-1500 :(
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:20:10
I sold 11 BTC for 3K before.....
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:30:39
I don't want to talk about it..... just had liver tests today and im drinking if that says anything lmao.. It was a fun social experiment, but seeing a 4K loss in 3 weeks hurts 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:31:21
Dead. At this PR... DEAD. better off as ants at 5 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:08:19
one confirm away...
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:22:51
that opportunity just slipped :/
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:29:50
like I said, social experiment... but No worries;)  Feel the root coin, drik from the root coin, fork from the root coin, I will take all of my dividends next time.
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:47:19

@_date: 2017-08-08 01:25:06

@_date: 2017-08-29 22:42:01
I don't think its anyones biz. but It will prob make them look more reputable to most consumers. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:43:23
I finally learned...
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:31:01
I dont sell either way so lets see how this goes. Viva la BTC( the actual bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:32:11
in my city the fees are 14-20% ID required after 1K. they work. paying for convience 
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:05:24
8 down the crapper and .8 back on hardware
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:44:30

@_date: 2017-08-12 17:34:59
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:36:57

@_date: 2017-08-05 08:43:29
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:50:53

@_date: 2017-08-12 09:04:26

@_date: 2017-08-29 22:13:12

@_date: 2017-08-08 04:48:47

@_date: 2017-08-08 11:29:29

MLM all you want tho.
I lost .6 to gladiacoin jah feels
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:09:55
Seeing if it really worked/ social ramifications, prospecting. Just a gambling man who took a lotto ticket. and were only a month old. I;ve never bailed on a project that early. ECT ECT... id like to see both survive then 2X get destroyed.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:51:32
look at bcash lmao . im holding bags of that shit still. waiting for the Mexican hang out.. but neo just had their dev conference in LA and if bct moves,,,,, everything else does. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:23:24
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:41:01

@_date: 2017-07-20 23:01:24
im at 45 mins....
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:12:15
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:57:16
how can this be properly documnented and time stamped? I;ve taken videos and photos of moving other coins around and having a ZERO availability for BTC W/D almost 2 days before their cut off..  This needs to be honored. I am stonewalled, fuck the ABC token I'll take them but I don't want my coins held hostage. 
They saved all the ETH babies when people sold ETH and they had stupid sell orders placed. This is a slap in the face to me, and another night of not sleeping. let alone a potential 2-3K in ABC tokens I can not rightfully access.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:20:19
I watched it and didn't buy till 1820. I really thought it was going down further. Ohh well:) I think things are going to be quite alright.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:37:07
ya man . then did 5 more and it was instant. strange but greatful
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:37:38
yes.... smelling a correction stronger than indian catered wedding.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:24:02
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:26:29
i saw 1750 and I dont think we will breach 1800 in this recovery phase. Come Wednesday or thursday I will not feel as confident. and I like that, another opportunity :) and if this is a true "recovery perhaps to 2K" then still cheers! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:17:56
get coins off coin base. and its a 1:1 ratio nothing will be chopped
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:22:15
oh yes, been awake for 30 hours doing work!
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:23:48
not happenin!
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:49:10
up 300 in a day.. Can't wait to catch this fall
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:43:06
dont try and catch knife? its worked 60% roughly but last time i made more fiat but lost 1.1 btc 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:31:55
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:53:16
im already established at a quite comfortable price point. Even if I sold and bought the dip, it may not even hit my holdings currently. All back on trezor and try to do some productive shit with my life instead of watching these guys toss poo
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:59:39
"This would exceed your daily withdrawal limit of $0.00"
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:58:18
When i go to withdraw it says I've gone over my daily limit of $0.....
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:24:40
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:51:29
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:54:15
gdax AKA back side of coinbase. coinbase/gdax is legit just not for long term holding. But you should not hold anything you arnt trading on an exchange anyway...
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:13:31
Not even kidding, Iv'e been awake for an extra 3 hours seeing if it will change. I cant' even gdax to coinbase....
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:18:01
we have taken a month of beatings.. I think the next 24 hours will be a sigh of relief. Then to re organize and get more cheap BTC/ what ever else fancies you.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:12:09
I agree. stoked to see 2K again 
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:44:57
still holding me hostage, I moved LTC fine...
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:08:53
never had an issue. but if you want free chain split coins take your BTC off gdax and coinbase and keep your private keys. trezor is your BFF
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:46:36
did that already. you miss 1750?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:03:05
&lt;333 that guys an ass.
