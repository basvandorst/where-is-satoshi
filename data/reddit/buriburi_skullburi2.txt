That's a fools dream, we need to wake up!
I'm not saying Bitcoin will fail or gain value to major ROIs. It applies to all crypto, but I do believe that crypto currency is not going anywhere (as it is here to stay). We need to protect privacy at all cost. 
The government has technology to watch/make decisions without our consent. Why not return the favor, to avoid them having full control over us? By us monitoring them like raise decrease funds as a whole where our taxes goes towards (including military spending), the government should be held accountable for "missing money", just how they hold us accountable for our attended and missing money. This is why we need to take control of our own government.
"We" as a whole entity can govern our government, we want our families and friends back from useless battles. It doesn't mean to disband our militaries, but to use them wiser. We need a strong military to be able to work with nations with the same understanding. We need to hold "OUR" taxes away from them. As we need to makesure our taxes are spent well. The government won't like it and will lock you or whomever they want to break you to give up your wealth, tax , and even crypto. "Cause this is how mafia works"
We should have mutual understanding, that we are humans not machines, think about it, that's why Americans (USA) have the 1st Amendment, evil will try to disarm you. Im not saying to knock down the borders. We need protection from those that will cause harm; barbarians/pirates/terrorist etc. We must be aware of the economist terrorist that try to flood into our country. The world isn't made up of marshmallow and kittens. Evil will resist and lie.
We need to focus on our education. Education is a major role to our survival, we co nould knock down language barriers. I
Like I said a fools dream
