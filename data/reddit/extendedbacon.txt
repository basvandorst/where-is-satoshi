Sorry I'm a little late, what happened in SK?

... could I get a tl;dr on that? It seems very unintuitive to me.

Lol idk where you got that idea but in my country inflation is about 2% annually which isn't bad i think

Huh...TIL - and yes, while I agree that this is a problem, the alternative is an economy with less consumption and hence less expenditure - a preferable alternative?

Ok, there's definitely some interesting points you make there, I'll give the book a go and maybe it'll change my mind on some things.

Ok fair enough, I'll accept that premise - the problem is that bitcoin isnt that, it's deflationary, which arguably creates an even bigger problem with price identification - constant decreases in price. 
Intuitively this discourages spending, no? Any rational person would hold bitcoin as it increases in value, and not spend, which is ironically the exact problem bitcoin is facing right now. 
Don't get me wrong, I want to see bitcoin succeed just as much as you do, I just feel there are quite a few fundamental roadblocks before we get there.

Ahahaha good point

I mean if you look at this one [ you can see it wouldn't have been an issue until the fed freaked out over the GFC, and that's ultimately the price paid to keep the rest of the economy afloat by stimulating spending. I agree, it was shitty policy, and in a properly competitive system TARP wouldn't have happened and quite a few banks would've gone down - but that would ultimately be even worse for most individuals due to the loss of their funds, loans, credit, etc.
Either way a small growth in money supply is necessary as a result of - guess what - inflation! Which wouldn't be an issue if wage growth tracked inflation - which, I concede, is an issue (but mostly an American one).
Mind you I'm Aussie and here the minimum wage laws pretty much negate that problem - plus strong unions help keep wage growth tracking inflation or greater (with the exception of property prices but that's a whole other barrel of fish).

...this isn't really in contradiction with neoclassical or Keynesian economics - you're talking about productivity growth, which mainstream economists tend to agree is the key to long term economic growth - look up the Solow-Swan growth model

I feel like no one here realises low levels of inflation are a good thing...����
