Do you work for a bank?

I don't think that anyone said it can't work, I and others have said that it can't scale. For example, the biggest issue, much more than submarine swaps to reload channels is the routing. Even Rusty agrees that end-point mapping and routing isn't scalable and a BGP based routing node approach is required.

Dude. You seem awfully defensive for no reason. It is an article, not a hand gernade. Anyways, I am an accountant with a technical background, this isn't a copy and paste. The technical in the article is correct but if you find a part that is incorrect, I would like to hear it. 
  
Regarding the LN routing being Ok, it is Ok right now because the current number of nodes is tiny. My article is extremely critical of the current topology. So if you can "handle" it, then let me know and I will give you first kick at the can.

Lol. I am not asking for money, I want someone to review before I publish it.

I literally talked about flare and that it is the only serious proposal out there right now. It has had a feasibility test. Do you know what the results from that? With only 2,500 AWS nodes, it was able to find payment routes in about 0.5 seconds with a probability of 80%. This is just in a simulated environment and if you think that a production environment with hostile actors will be higher, I would love to know the reasoning behind that.

You missed my point that the current Internet runs in a trusted environment and it is really easy to abuse BGP:  
   
  
As for a "lot of people" working on routing. I don't think that is the case. I am not seeing a lot of feasibility studies and simulations on a bridge node based routing solution. Particularly when you have a network that has to update all of the routing tables balances for every transaction.

Craig Wright, he told me so. Who else would have more money than Taiwan?

I can't imagine how anyone can look at this story and think that this situation is not a disaster for merchant adoption.

It is a four page article...
