July 12, 2010 Bitcoin was at $0.06  
July 12, 2020 Bitcoin is at $20,000 (assumption, could be more)  
That's just about a **333,340 X** or a **33334000%** gain in one decade.

You're right, it's more reasonable for it to hit 50,000 or even 100,000k.

Bitcoin's a shitcoin, bought it at a peak , now everyone thinks I'm weak. A self made freak. Every time I speak I seek to discredit every reddit, that I'm fedup with. Now it's just a myth that you can make millions off of crypt, need to get that lift that high from when the prices soared to the sky. Cryptos shot to the moon, all doom and gloom was in the past and soon the euphoria kicked in like a ballon, ready to pop, now I felt like I just got shot, hit by a rock, tumbling to the ground, landed on a grass mound, in the middle of nowhere never to be found.  
Someone continue the bars....
