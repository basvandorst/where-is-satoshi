Btc always has a slight drawdown on its parabolic moves just like it has a slight bounce when it’s dumping
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:48:03

The private keys are stored on a secure chip in memory that can never be erased by leaving it unplugged it’s safe there, I’m not sure on the failure rate of these devices but I’ve not heard anything about them breaking, just always make sure you keep a copy of the word seed it generates on setup so you can recover your wallets :)

That’s the node information what you need to do is to create an invoice for 100 satoshis on the receive tab, the long string of numbers and letters starts with ln
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:07:58
Needs to be a LN invoice

thats an ordinary btc address! you need to create a lightning wallet and create an invoice for 100 satoshis the invoice will start with ln
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:15:44
needs to be a LN invoice, i would recommend checking out bluewallet \*not sponsored by the way\*

Satoshis are the smallest denomination of bitcoin, lightning is the second layer tech to make bitcoin faster!
You can download bluewallet and set up a lightning wallet in seconds and receive 100 satoshis from me for free!
