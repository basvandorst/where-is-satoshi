Isn't Google throwing billions at this?

Kind of reminds me of your username
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:44:27
Just buy more
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:32:48
Good point, do you have an alternative?
@_date: 2014-01-04 14:53:32
What you're forgetting to mention is that this avenue of communication is overwhelmingly American. Alexia shows Reddit is 46% American visitors, with the next largest being India at 11% (wait really?). And to only drive this point home, the next three (Canada Australia UK) combined are only 12%.
Could some people be a little more descriptive? Always. But maybe a little logic should be applied when its unclear to you. This isnt a case of Americans thinking they're the only country in the world, its a case of this site being an American audience in the first place.

Never go ass to mouth, guys.

The other half of users do not exist under the same government. A proper comparison in this context would be between individual countries, and America outnumbers any other country 10 to 1 in visitors except apparently India which is only 5 to one.
As a side note, does anyone know what on reddit accounts for India's 11%? I'm genuinely curious now.

I suppose our disagreement boils down to whether we should be talking in terms of simple majority or relative majority. America is the relative majority of reddit, by a landslide.

I believe he was speaking tongue in cheek, referring to the common misconception that it's untraceable. I think people often conflate the ability to be reasonably anonymous over bitcoin with some idea that it's also untraceable.

I once moved in with some guys to ride out the end of their lease and start a new one with a different roommate. Different roommate bailed and I went elsewhere. I never had mail forwarded there and never was on any official documentation.
Somehow coin base asked me about that address O_O
Edit: this was also 6+ years ago

Only non essential functions were shut down. Law enforcement is still in full swing.
But kudos for actually writing to your senator!
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:56:21
Very hard, to near impossible

Just chiming in, I use them with coinbase and have had no issues either! Its the best bank I've ever used.

::puts on tinfoil hat:: Or that's the excuse they're giving the public so they don't tip their hand as to how embedded in TOR they are.  The government wouldn't do that though, would they? Just go on the internet and tell lies?

I love it when they rearrange the days transactions so the largest comes out first and now all of the smaller transactions are overdrafts, instead of you having actually made one overdraft.
Crooks, all of them.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:49:46
I believe people consider this a good move.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:05:14
Because that's what you do with money.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:48:49
This is where I get my info from
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:38:47
No I don't. Who is he?

"Is bitcoin the currency of the future? We have no clue, but we will continue swinging the banhammer!"
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:10:00
Great bank, I use them too!

Except without these 'shills' the price might not be where it is today. Its advertising, it gets people interested.

American here...I want some :(
