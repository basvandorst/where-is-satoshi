I literally said that too! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:22:30
1/10 expected better, and obvious username. Step your troll game up son! 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:27:54
So tip.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:55:25
So you're saying you're a woman and I should send you pictures of my cock right?
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:02:29
As long as he has a steady supply and is a stable person.
But as soon as his supply gets arrested, or he is in need for a quick buck he'll jack you. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:57:38
Upvoted. I would don that title with pride!
Edit: it's probably a business handling that, but a guy can dream right?!?
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:46:31
Ah well I was just curious. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:59:26
You lost me when you seriously used the word "merit" in a sentence.
You are clearly an elitist, and your logic inherently flawed.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:15:15
Well I probably got caught because I was in an active a drug addiction and could barely even function enough to do crime even.
But true, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Be it jail or death. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:16:00
Wouldn't be surprised if some heavy hitting Wall Street fellows are trying to use it as a pump and dump of sorts.
However what they may not realize is they are really helping in bringing attention to it.
It isn't some worthless penny stock, it has real value to the world, so anyone trying to hype it up even for selfish reasons is doing a good service.
Another outcome would be bitcoin paving the way for a next gen crypto and possible flaws of bitcoin being it's demise. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:40:21
By your logic the Enron whistleblowers even were unethical.
Fuck out of here. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:28:37
I'm personally shocked that a drug dealer would claim to give you drugs in exchange for money and just keep the money and not give you drugs.
Literally spewed my coffee out my mouth when I read this. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:27:32
Sadly campaign contributions in the US are bribery as well.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:11:27
Takes me back to the days when I used a card writer to program the stolen credit card numbers I bought online onto credit cards. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:33:36
"One day at a time"
That saying isn't really poplar outside of 12 step groups. Any prior exposure to that? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:18:24
Yeah, I wonder what'll come nxt.
That's no typo either.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:32:28
Paypal is essentially in direct competition to bitcoin so I wouldn't expect any love from them. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:02:16
Haha no that would be such a waste..
Currently I'm applying my 12 step program I've used to recover from drug addiction to recover from the porn addiction.
We'll see how it goes, but I definitely need to get plugged in over at nofap!
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:03:03
Except bitcoin was completely original. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:08:17
Allegedly.

Someone is an avid WoW player..
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:42:21
As I convicted felon I don't really take offense to this or blame you for saying this.

Mt. God: where God gave Moses the bitcoin protocol on stone tablets. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:08:13
Literally this. I came here to say this.
But in all seriousness I signed the change.org petition... It must have got to him. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:16:13
Making the documents is easy. Getting away with what you do with them is the hard part. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:53:41
Well played M'Sir. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:36:55
OP probably found a way to short the coin and is doing what he can to increase the returns. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:25:29
Mine is relevant all day and all night. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:46:22
A deinstitutionalized education is the path many of the greats have chosen.
Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:03:02
I done goofed!  
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:53:40
Please source, sounds like a good read. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:26:45
Keep in mind though that the documents required for verification are easily forged.
I can say this with confidence because that's how I earned a felony for identity theft at age 19. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:18:15
I had a business fail a good friend invested in.
I just told him straight up what happened, there was no shame in my voice when I did because failure happens. Nothing wrong with failure.
It didn't affect our relationship negatively in the least. 
He knew it could fail when he invested, but he was willing to take a risk, just as I was. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:19:50
Hey guys. I'm looking to switch to bitcoin only on my t shirt shop online.
I have no interest in converting the coins to cash, so is there some sort of way to do a shopping cart with bitcoin as only option?
I know I could just do the qr code on the site, but that would be hard to organize all the payments and orders etc. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:46:42
Joke confirmed: I laughed. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:50:13
There was a thread with a list of the threads man.
I trust you've heard of google? 
Really starting to look like a false flag, and I mean really. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:40:28
So freedom of press is not covered in reddit?
I'm under the impression their servers are US based, but if not than this would make sense then if it violated the hosting country's laws. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:54:09
Considering the gox CEO was on the board of the foundation, it's fair to blame them too even. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:20:04
Doge coin over bitches 
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:14:03
Seriously, cut it out. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:14:30
From my understanding id say some vs credit card processing fees?
Plus the shirts are really just a hobby I do for fun and extra money. 
Kind of want to even day trade with some of the coin too and see what happens. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:23:10
That's what he wants, always Upvote the troll. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:31:49
Still though, with an IQ like that who are we to question? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:34:20
It helps. I sent word to Warren Buffet in regards to our exchange. I'll keep ya posted. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:36:33
Could literally have a reverse gangbang with any pornstars he wanted. For months on end. 
Worth it? My mind says yes, but the heart says no. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:44:00
The shirts are all internet culture related. Many of them are about bitcoin itself.
Figure It'll be a good way to evangelize bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:00:36
Grass is always greener isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:31:13
Nah not since 2008.

The Winklevoss twins are afoot...
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:47:21
You are right, this has been one of the selling points of bitcoin since day one. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:16:08
Including moderation.
Buy more. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:21:37
The OP said "please respect the law" at the end. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:11:44
I think it could actually go either way.
It would have been a great article if she called it "bitcoin founder, found?" And then presented her evidence. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:52:05
Gordon Gekko said it thus it is true for ever and ever, amen.

Greed, is good.

It called itself a bank therefore novice users believed it to be a bank.
If we alienate these users, we alienate mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:09:03
It tends to do that : P
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:21:02
Accepted. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:57:31
A short term buyer can take advantage of this too. 
And help stabilize the price in the process. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:18:40
Heh. Suppose a google search would a turned that up..
It is moronic Monday though 
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:58:15
Neat way to circumvent the over zealous communist party.
I like it. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:08:23
Um, yea? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:39:00
Do you drunk alcohol or use drugs of any kind in any amounts? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:05:34
Seriously. I'd take an 8k loss and a wife over this damn pornography I use any day.
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:44:51
Because doge is a litecoin clone which is a bitcoin clone, and for all intents and purposes is a joke.
Edit: shame. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:46:20
The principal of what I was saying applies and not the literal word for word terms and definitions. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:25:34
The difference being a limit to the number of bitcoins, and a revelation as to the unlimited supply of tulips. 
Edit: I'm no economist, but maybe this has to do with supply and demand or some shit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:52:56
I wouldn't say case closed. Who in their right mind would say yes I invented it, look at me world!
Keep in mind, he could have made the post online from the original username to throw some of this heat off himself. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:51:37
Oh wow, yeah that's fucked up. Didn't think of it that way. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:56:38
Keep in mind the man could have made the post to throw the press of himself. This doesn't disprove anything. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 19:38:21
So it is with God. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:17:47
It's a valid question, because if someone plans to use it as a legitimate currency then Bitcoin has to be competitive with the convenience of cash or credit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:25:26
Only problem with your argument is if mtgox no longer has an online presence, then how are they even supposed to officially speak on it first?
