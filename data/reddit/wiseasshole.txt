You are the immature one, who thinks my comment is a personal attack. Gregory Maxwell is, allegedly, an authority on this matter. And he said malleability is a feature. Then, after joining Blockstream, his views on many subjects changed 180° overnight. That's pretty relevant to the discussion.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:34:12
All these "solutions" only push the problem to someone else. If the bus has 20 seats, and 100 people want to ride it, it doesn't matter how much they pay: only 20 will make it.
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:13:01
He didn't insult them. Christians regularly tell each other to have "faith". Which basically means "don't think about it, just believe it". And they consider that a virtue.
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:27:29


Maybe because it's not a science.


What about the cosmic microwave background radiation?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:49:27


So the problem is that Core isn't doing anything? Why do you complain about BU then?
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:37:48


In science, a theory is an explanation. It can be right, it can be wrong, it can be partially right/wrong, etc. So the word theory doesn't say anything about how likely it is to be true, or how accepted it is by the scientific community. The Big Bang Theory is fully accepted at this point. 


On the contrary, matter does come from nothing\*, and is explained by Quantum Theory.
\* as in empty space, but not the ideal "nothing", because even in empty space as we know it there is energy, quantum fields, etc.
@_date: 2017-02-03 17:33:07
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:42:25
But Gregory Maxwell said malleability was not a problem at all. In fact, it's a feature, he said (before joining Blockstream).

@_date: 2017-02-23 12:43:56
AFAIK no user has to do anything. Copay should just fix this and the next version should be aware that previous versions had the bug, and check for both results (with/without bug).
@_date: 2017-02-19 18:55:34
Maybe because most of us have to deal more with Christians and are more annoyed by them than by others.

It seems like you don't like facts, like the ones in my comment. Sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:15:00
More like: there's literally zero evidence for it, so we probably shouldn't create entire cults and lifestyles and wars around it. We can't see air either, but we know it's there because there's other types of evidence for it.

Not really, because they want to decide everything for the rest of us, and fight against the free market. They are deciding for us on economic matters, not technical ones.

If it reaches 100%, your node will be useless. Your node will end up being part of a network with no hashrate, and any little miner will be able to attack it just because it can. Your only options will be to join the winning network, or change your hashing algorithm and become an altcoin.

The truth is nobody knows what they are doing. Everyone is just following their hearts or their pockets, like in economics.

Ethereum is turing-complete, therefore more insecure. They used to claim "turing-completeness" was a feature. The truth is, Satoshi made Bitcoin turing-incomplete on purpose. He was trying to build sound money, not a marketing stunt.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:52:24
Ethereum's DAO was exploited by a clever guy, and now Ethereum devs are thinking about rolling back the blockchain to steal from him. But that would crush confidence in Ethereum's smart contracts. So there is no good ending for this, and so ETH price is crashing.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:47:50
You mean twice as much. Fees went up in BTC, and BTC also went up in USD 2x in the past months.
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:43:19
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:53:10
So we have a currency that proved to be safe for 6 years, and another one that not only is turing-complete (which makes it inherently not safe), but also has recently been hacked precisely because of that. Choose wisely.
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:08:42
Well, now you know it isn't. No guys, you won't outsmart Satoshi. Sorry.
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:52:11

Hmm no, that's not me. I understand both, and I think Bitcoin is good and ETH is bad.
But anyone who disagrees with you must be dumb, right? And you need to name-call him.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:39:37
It's not understandable to run into known problems that everyone warned you about and you just ignored because love to think you are smarter than Satoshi. No wonder you also invested in Ripple and Dogecoin.
@_date: 2016-06-22 11:08:55
But he's right, it's not a different wallet for the same chain. It forks into a separate chain, that follows the same economics Bitcoin has always had. Bitcoin Core deviated from that by allowing blocks to become full.
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:15:53
But like I was saying, even if we pay the same fees in BTC, they are already worth more. My 0.1 mBTC fee right now is worth much more than my 0.1 mBTC last year. Let's say the market cap goes up 2x so we need more security. Cool, my fees are automatically worth 2x. No need to pay more in BTC denomination.

You have rights to your own image in most countries. No one can use it without your permission, no matter if it's for commercial purposes or not. You can ask anyone to stop using your image, and sue if they don't, or if it already caused damage to you.
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:28:21
Not the best example, since they only were able to do something about it when one of the guys bought something to be delivered to his own house, and the whole case was full of corruption on the state's side.
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:08:29
No one pretended 0-confirmation transactions were perfectly secure for everything.
Instead, we understand Bitcoin doesn't work in a vacuum. It works with people. That's why 0-confirmation transactions are perfectly secure for buying a coffee, for instance. Or digital subscriptions (eg: steam games), or many other things.
But Peter Todd, just like many others here (you included?), is an awkward nerd with 0 idea of how human relations work, and thinks if the system isn't perfectly secure in its own digital world, then it's useless and needs to be destroyed until we find a perfect solution.
That's why Bitcoin is stagnating. Instead of good enough solutions, we have no solutions at all. Just wishful thinking about possible perfect solutions that will never actually be deployed, like Lightning Network and whatnot.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:40:55

It doesn't make much sense to assume something crazy happened to Satoshi, when he explicitly said he was leaving to work on other things.
Maybe he didn't like the strees of being in charge of such a huge invention.
@_date: 2016-06-30 15:42:14
It's an arbitrage for energy prices. Where energy is cheap, Bitcoin mining will even the price until it's back to normal. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2016-06-02 11:53:56
This. He has rights over his own image. They can't use it like that without his permission, and I find it pretty crazy that they are so ignorant of the law.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:45:13
Sounds like blocks are full.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:21:30
Fact: This guy said upgrading Bitcoin's block size limit was safe.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:54:28
If that were true, OP's transaction would have been confirmed on the first block. It wasn't, it had to wait until there was room for it.
@_date: 2016-06-05 05:09:24


Are you sure? Because predicting the future is one of the main tasks of science.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:57:23
So that's what we do now? We try to derail the discussion with nitpicking and ignore the fact transactions are having to wait many blocks until there is room for them, instead of confirming on the next block like they used to?
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:34:39


False. It hasn't been upgraded at all yet.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:50:40

According to you.


What's madness is believing you can tell others what % of their unknown capital is ok to have in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:45:02
The same thing happened to me when I joined Bitcoin long time ago. Getting the average cost down seemed crazy to outsiders but turned out to be the right move. I did it because I understood Bitcoin and I knew it was no fad.
@_date: 2016-06-30 11:54:16
It's the other way around actually.
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:44:03
What are you talking about? Both Armory and Electrum support offline storage, and also multi-signature. Just download Tails, create a new wallet with Electrum and you are done.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:47:54


False. Only the number of BTC they receive is reduced. When price goes up 2x or more, like it has happened in the last days, then they are earning the same or more wealth, not less. Same thing happened in the previous halvening. But for some reason there is this narrative that some people want to push, that we need to pay more fees to save the miners. In fact, even if we paid the same amount of BTC in fees, we would be paying more since the price went up. So fees are going to the moon basically, for no good reason.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:11:48


No it's not. It's just distributed all around the globe, so you won't notice it until it's a big % of the world.

Maybe you should concentrate on what you really like: movies.
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:23:04
Satoshi (you know, the guy who created all this?) said 0-confirmation transactions were safe for many things. You are the one trying to change this.
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:51:53

@_date: 2017-01-01 17:21:53
You have analyzed it well. Many of us thought and did the same thing in the past.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:50:33
And you know perfectly well it's accepted by A LOT of people. It has more acceptance than half the currencies in the world. And I don't see you complaining about the Uruguayan peso or whatever.

@_date: 2016-06-23 11:01:53
Satoshi was the only one who knew what he was doing but he isn't here anymore, so my statement stands true.

Yeah, Bitcoin is pretty good.
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:18:39
No, you are saying that. What I'm saying is you rather see Bitcoin wrecked because you believe you are right, than come to a compromise with miners.
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:40:48

I have no say in this matter, I'm not a miner. And you are the one who doesn't want to accept facts: Miners don't want "Segwit as a softfork and 1mb limit forever".

@_date: 2017-01-25 21:21:59


If only someone brought this issue years ago... Oh wait
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:49:53
Doesn't matter if you think it's bad. It's what Blockstream agreed to do when they had a meeting with the Chinese miners. Then Blockstream broke that agreement, and so now Chinese miners won't accept Segwit as they feel betrayed and don't trust Blockstream anymore.
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:31:55
That wouldn't change anything, as I'm not a miner. Maybe you should try listening to miners, who do have more hashing power than you and all Core Devs combined.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:23:19
Jeff Garzik and Sergio Lerner (security expert) already said upgrading to 2mb is safe.
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:47:29
- Miners want to upgrade to 2mb (without Segwit)
- Only then they will accept Segwit
- I'm not a miner
Honestly I don't know how else I can explain the problem to you. You just keep taking things personally, and believing throwing a tantrum on reddit will change miners' minds.
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:29:45
I'm not a miner, so I'm not blocking anything. But I guess everyone, including big miners who are making a lot of money, are stupid, and you are smart. Right?
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:14:27
Stats are not looking good for Segwit tbh. The pools that decided to support Segwit lost their hash rate because miners left, because nobody wants "Segwit as a softfork and 1mb limit forever".

It's not a what if. I'm telling you what actually happened: Top contributors like Gavin, Jeff Garzik, Sergio Lerner, etc wanted to upgrade the block size for years. But Blockstream members used stalling tactics to keep it at 1 mb forever.

Have you checked the price lately?
And what if the price goes down 90%? Maybe we should increase fees 10x just in case, because we can't predict the future and the sky will fall!
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:47:30
I asked you to show me the formula, and you just shared a link to a website with historic data of fees. You don't seem to understand the difference: The fee you have to pay to make it into the next block depends on the fees that others pay at the same time. So there's literally no way to know which fee you have to pay, because there's not enough room for everyone. 30 passengers can't ride a bus with 10 seats, no matter how much they pay. 20 will be left out.

After a year or so, you will be so much above your initial investment, that you won't mind it swinging a little here and there. And after a few years you will be eating popcorn and enjoying all the swings: No matter where it ends, you have already won big time.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:21:47
Yes, when the price goes up they are just some nice guys making light hearted jockes. Ah, but when the price goes down... Also try to tell them you have a different idea about the role the State should have. Try telling them you don't believe it should control every aspect of your life, and see how nice and respectful they are.

Supply and demand. If sending fiat to other countries is harder from that country, Bitcoin is scarcer and therefore more expensive.

Our "crashes" always leave us better than we were before the "bubble" begins. That's why we call them corrections. Price was supposed to go up, but people/speculators got too hype and and the price went up too much, so then it has to correct downwards. Happens every time.

Satoshi deleted his own name from the website, and who was the other on that website? Gavin. And what did Satoshi say before leaving? He literally said Bitcoin was in good hands. He didn't suddenly vanish without explanation. He said he was going to work on other things.

Sure, but it has to happen in one place before others. Sometimes there's a sudden increase in demand in one country, and then it translates into an increase in demand in every other country due to arbitrage. That's what I want to know: Where is it coming from this time?
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:25:10
I know, not everyone who knows about it understands it.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:01:04
I hope you don't mind it being 1 EUR, 10 EUR, or 100 EUR either, because there's no limit to how expensive it can get. Except maybe if Bitcoin just stops growing, which is already happening.

There would be no price that guarantees you win the bid. And if more than one person wants the painting, they can bid all the money in the world, and still only one of them will win the bid. The others will be out of luck and will have to move onto something else.

I mean with that title you are even pretending this isn't your own site, even though you have a Spanish (the language) username. And the site is all about giving money to it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 12:09:00
That's incorrect. Your node doesn't need to increase the effort exponentially, just linearly. One thing is the traffic from node to node when sharing transactions and blocks (this is the traffic that matters), and a completely different thing is the traffic from node to users (eg: Electrum users).
Your node connects to the number of peers you decide, and you don't need to change it after a block size increase. Let's say your node connects to 80 other nodes, and after a block size increase instead of 1mb/s you need 1.1mb/s. That's it, there's the 10% traffic increase. There's no exponent involved, no matter how many nodes your are connecting to.

You have no clue what you are talking about. What happened in Ethereum has nothing to do with this, they wanted to rollback a theft, and half of the community didn't want that, so they split. We just need to set up an activation threshold, so either we have a majority and the upgrade is done succesfully, or it isn't done at all. In any case we are completely safe.

My guess is Bitcoin price is being held down by the lack of scaling. First Core didn't want to increase the block size with a protocol upgrade, and now the r\btc crowd doesn't want Segwit. The minute this gets resolved, the price will skyrocket, that's for sure. I'd say it's a good time to buy.

When people say transactions are not confirming, they mean *some*. Eg: X transactions get confirmed, but other 5% go to the backlog. So just because your trasaction ended up in X, it doesn't mean Bitcoin is working fine.

It's a stupid idea at best (rushing turing-completeness), and a scam at worst (even Vitalik already sold most of his coins). And eventually it will be done right in Bitcoin, and ETH will be just another redundant altcoin. Let alone the fact it has already been hacked precisely because they are letting anyone run any code, just like we predicted, and millions were stolen. Even Doge is a better store of value than ETH.
You don't need any ideology to dismiss ETH. It's just bad.
