No, coinbase is a good place to buy coins but you don't own them unless you hold them. It's better to move them to a wallet where you control the keys yourself.

No, those are blockchains like bitcoin. They have the same limitation as bitcoin, blockchain has a limited amount of transactions per second. I don't want to shill another coin here. But since you asked, there is a coin that scales and has zero fees. IOTA, it doesn't use blockchain but a DAG. I have my bets placed on both Bitcoin and IOTA because they both have different but valuable uses.
