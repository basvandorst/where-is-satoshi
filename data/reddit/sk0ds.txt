Australia is in an insane housing bubble, powered by banks, the gov, the media all working together to inflate it. In other words, never trust an aussie media outlet reporting on btc. Ppl investing in something that is not real estate is a threat to a lot of vested interests.

This is a very good point, the main benefit of using a blockchain comes from taking out trust from any transaction. Banks sole reason for existence is that society had to outsource risk to a trusted third party to facilitate trade. The banking business model has become obsolete now that society can take care of this by using triple entry bookkeeping technology without the use of a middleman / parasite

Someone else posted this a while ago, just a copy paste:
"Why dont banks just start their own blockchains? I doubt they will want to because blockchains are expensive to run as an institution and, when an institution runs a blockchain on their own servers, it will always be cheaper to just move everything to a centralized database -- which is what they use now. Blockchains only become cost effective when you "outsource" the job of running nodes to volunteers, and I question whether banks will think that's a good idea. Whoever controls the nodes controls the network. Banks want to control the network because it's a financial network. So they'll want to control the nodes. And then we're back to square one: if they run all the nodes, it's super expensive, and since all the nodes have the same data on them, they'll be like, "Um, why don't we just consolidate, and have one database?" And then it's not a blockchain anymore."

Ok just to be sure we're not talking about some daytrading stats here, but about the development of the entire crypto ecosystem, a bit of context for you about this 'newly formed association': 
"A bitcoin ATM might seem unconventional, but it makes sense in Zug. The town of 30,000 has persistently attracted entrepreneurs who specialize in digital currency, and by 2014 it became known in the financial world as Crypto Valley. These businesses — first drawn to Switzerland’s political stability and Zug’s smooth bureaucracy — have found a country open to their unorthodox ideas about currency. Bitcoin allows users to make anonymous payments without relying on a central authority, like a bank or credit card company. It has quickly become popular with a small group of technologically minded enthusiasts with a libertarian bent, who see it as a way to get around authoritative national institutions and governments. “What we’re trying to do is decentralize the financial system,” says Gevers. “Switzerland has the most decentralized political system in the world, so they understand what we’re doing and don’t see it as a threat but an opportunity.”
Now you tell me a gov potentially cracking down on ICO's in a country that was considered a crypto safe haven, vanguard and incubator has no impact on Bitcoin because of low Chf volume. Rrright! You keep watching the charts dude, I'll keep on eye on the bigger picture.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:37:11
Amen to this. Crypto is something that gives me hope for the future more than anything. Every generation had its cause to fight for, but our generation (Millenials) seems to be particularly self centered, borderline narcissist and consumerist (e.g Insta). I see this as a result of giving up on the idea of a better world. Can't blame us, because global elites have been consolidating power and wealth for the past 20 years, to a degree that it seems impossible to have high hopes for any wealth building on our part.
Until crypto came around, that is. It's not a coincidence that this FUD war against bitcoin in particular is raging now, elites are feeling threatened. They could have a good laugh about the Occupy Wallstreet movement and its lacking prowess, but its analysis of the problem was spot on. The sentiments are still there, and crypto proves to be an extremely powerful tool in the hands of the many that might just usher in a global flippening of power and wealth. All we need to do is buy and hodl, get your money off your savings accounts that will allow your bank to create money out of thin air through the fractional reserve banking system. Not only to lock in profits for yourself, but to lock in our best shot at a better world.

This would be true if you had 1 btc and gave your friend a piece of paper saying he can collect a btc from you any time and then he'd pay the hooker with that piece of paper. Next day you print one trillion of those notes and start lending it at interest to your goverment who's a lil tight on money. You just became the FED. Meanwhile your friend is lending out a 0,9 btc note to his buddy Ray, who also wants to get properly laid for a change. Ray now owes him 0.9btc + interest, but he never even had any btc in the first place. Your friend's name is Jamie and he thinks he's a genius.

I think the most important observation you make here is the powerful social construct behind Bitcoin, the system of values it was born out of. It is this what gives Bitcoin its real revolutionary potency, because it gives people hope for a better and fairer world. Thats why Bitcoin is much more than merely a currency, a store of value or just an object of speculation or whatever. It has a very compelling ideology behind it, something often overlooked.

The legacy finance guys have always deemed themselves so powerful, always able to crush or suffocate any new model emerging. But this is unstoppable. Jamie Dimon &amp; Co remind me a lot of Gorbatchev right before the collapse of communism in the SU: they know their days are numbered because they can see their empire imploding. They hoped to stretch it until after their lifetimes, but Bitcoin will ensure they are the last generation. Very painful.
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:16:25
Bitcoin is definitely superior to gold yes.
