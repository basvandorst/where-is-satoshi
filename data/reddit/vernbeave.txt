It did work!

Exactly. From their point of view, you looked like Ralph Wiggums: "Bitcoins are good, but I don't have a computerator."
When they laughed you out, it was a test. You might be better off working at Starbucks, and there is nothing wrong with that. But hang in there, move on and give it your best shot! Pass this test and the next few they throw at you! But if you really are a fish out of water, then the environment will get toxic and you best leave, for your own good.

"A" virtual currency should be worth $10 - 200 billion. Not sure if it is Bitcoins or something more mature in a few years.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:44:43
Or whatever its mature equivalent is. If Google backed up a currency, I'd be on that, at least 10% of my virtual coin.

You hit the nail on the head. It is an awesome feeling, to be so enthusiastic and interested in something. It's like a switch turned on inside your head and said that this is it. This is something. I can feel it. And you check the price every few minutes and actually have to make an effort not to talk to your friends and family too much about it, because that is all that's on your mind. When you're driving or sitting in class or daydreaming, or settling in for the night, the thoughts calm you and make you happy. It's an awesome ride, one that you'll never forget, but keep in mind your judgement is a bit clouded. And it will hurt when things go bad. It's so worth it, and you likely will pay a lot for it, but as long as you don't lose the house or car you'll be better off for it.

Actually, I did not include everything I wanted in the post. Diversification is important. Cash out a chunk of Bitcoins and buy anything on the market. Silver is good, there's a 90% chance it will be worth more than the Bitcoins by next year. Then you can switch back.

Both scanned the same, but this one was more difficult for QR Droid, likely due to the shadow on top.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:39:26
Not my finest. Sorry.

Exactly, this advice is for the speculators. Bitcoin is much, much more than this, but speculation is where the most people get hurt.

You missed out on the maple syrup run-up last week.

You weren't laughed out of the room because of Bitcoins. You were laughed out because of the way you spoke about it. Any new guy who is invited to a senior meeting and takes up 10 minutes of time will get laughed out, no matter what they talk about. You are learning how to play the game. Take this as a corporate etiquette lesson and move on.

Thanks! My first!

If I had a lot of Bitcoins, I would take out at least 1% every few days. Heck, it went up 20% today. Keeps the pipes open and lubed.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:28:26
That's a great attitude if you can afford it. We need people in it for the long run. I'm in it too, but took the long route and ponied up for a video card instead of buying coins directly.

It scans. You have a balance of 0.00 BTC.

A good shark strategy is to have cash already in your trading account, waiting for those $2 panic sells when the floor is thin. But again a bit of a risk to have a lot of cash in an overburdened trading account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:26:42
No, it went totally over my head. Like the Hunt Brothers on cornering the market.
