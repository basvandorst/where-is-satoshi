@_date: 2017-12-15 06:00:11
perhaps you didn't realize that you can just say look i was doing that because the service limited my purchases sells rate
then guess what, it is not structuring, problem solved, you have a misunderstanding of what structuring is and not everything is 'guilty hang em' territory
so you get reported, doesn't mean nothing, in fact it only means something if you are concerned about tangential things being scrutinized, because this specifically would pass

you are a genius, you have figured it out.
except you forgot a few things, like check your context
it's not valid, that's not what's permanent for all time
why would people use millions of custom alt coins?
and how would they even?
they won't they'll just use bitcoin, and you think the company will keep their better coin?  won't matter the indivuidual will just excahnge their bitcoin for that thing at the last leg of the transaction atomic swap poof your done

Have you seen the mining modules which are built into shipping containers?  They don't even unbox, they just park them on some cinder blocks by a power supply and turn them on.
They probably cost a hundred grand, but it's just business.
The capital is a separate entity.  A customer, lined up and ready to buy.
To say it doesn't make any sense is too flippant, maybe you think it doesn't add up and ultimately cannot work.  But people are investing in these shipping containers.

Even with laws, some things are crimes and somethings are just illegal.  but perhaps that is semantics.
What's not semantics is that somethings have direct injured parties commonly referred to as victims and somthings do not.
I'd prefer to keep the laws focused on preventing crimes which have injured parties.
In other words, eliminate no-victim 'crime' prosecution as it's just the easy way out and leads to problem.
The juice isn't worth the squeeze comes to mind.
I would argue that making a fake ID is not the same as money laundering, money laundering is a service, while fake ID is a manufacure.  The ID itself is just a thing, not until it is used by the party trying to pass it off as real has there been a criminal act.  (in my 'how things ought to be run' book)
For example Chuckee Cheese tokens are not counterfeit, yet occasionally someone tries to pass one off.

I saw some plans for a geothermal heat chimney which would be a vertical wind tunnel with a cannopy of glass around the bottom in a circle of hundreds of acres, then the air moves up through the middle and runs turbines, however they have to be built in the desert and so transmission of power is not feasible, but with bitcoin mining, they don't need transmission
so it changes the economics of those types of designs too

Or in this case, taking a non problem and causing it to become an example of bullying and coercion.
Yes it is a slippery slope, the rights of the minority to practice their faith (not shared by everyone) etc.
Is it perfect no.  Should a Muslim deli be FORCED to sell non halal?
Why not?  Why can they open a deli and not serve every kind of slaughtered meat that a non muslim would want?  A non muslim would find HALAL meat not adequate for them, why should they have to go find it elsewhere.  The muslim gets to run their business with this because it's a SUBSET of services.  You don't have to run a full gamut of products and services.  Selling HALAL meat to non muslims is fine.  Forcing muslims to provide non HALAL meat is NOT fine.

I am **not** supporting discrimination.
You are not as smart as you think, what I'm saying is pretty straight forward.  You just cannot open your mind to real thought and instead parrot **discrimination**, you are a childish thinker.
You are discriminating on the basis of religion, you advocate some people be unable to operate a bakery because it conflicts with your religion.  You insist the baker was discriminating but he was not.  He doesnt bake a cake with two grooms on it for straight people either, in fact he bakes it for **no one**, that's not discrimination.
But you don't care to think, you care you coerce others and hide behind government.  As if there are legitimate grievances.  You are a charlatan.

Let me clarify some things for you.
segwit2x cannot be shorthanded to 2x because, 2x already exists, "Bitcoin Cash" or bcash is 2x
While it is understandable why someone might be inclined to make that shorthand especially since the 'no2x' movement was specifically about 'no segwit 2x' since again the actual '2x' already was out and known as bcash...
So while you can do that, you won't be communicating at all effectively.
And I may be mistaken, but since segwit2x includes segwit, again I'm confused how it can be easier to do segwit2x or as you say '2x' rather than segwit...
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:45:32
they shouldn't increase the blocksize yet, but the other comment was a hypothetical to compare to what bcash situation would be...
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:05:42
good point
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:13:26
I agree it doesn't make sense.  Publicly, I am quite sure they are not this dumb, they have their reasons and they are not publicly stating them.
It certainly looks to me when including other 'blunder's that they have an agenda to corner the market and segwit by itself does not advance that agenda, and I would argue they believe it goes against their agenda.
It's not just a matter of spending the money...
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:57:35

Well if you care to have the answer you'll have to do some homework yourself too ya know.
For starters.
Bitcoin is a bearer instrument, not a debt note.
The supply is finite, there is no ability to increase the amount available.  Which is a **fundamental** tool of central banks and governments, to spend and have the invisible tax of just making everyones savings accounts worth a bit less each day due to increased total of money available.
How will bitcoin have any effect on global or national debt?
I don't know what effect it will have, but I don't think it would be paying it off that is for sure!

"You want a multi-billion dollar company to take a chance on a new technology with only 8% adoption which is not enough to be considered a consensus. Do you understand what issues might result if hundreds of thousands of customers run into a technical issue because they decided to be the "cutting edge", "lead the pack" kind of group? "
You ask, you have been told, the % is 8 due to coinbase not implementing it.
Then you go on to claim coinbase should be excused cause it's sooooo hard.
And you were told also that they were all over themselves drooling and salivating at the segwit2x they were trying to ram down everyones throats.  But oh, segwit "no customers asking for it" "its too hard".

Precisely, they don't want to decorate a cake with two grooms.  If you don't care to watch the you tube 'gotcha' on the muslim bakeries which don't want to make the tame cake which says 'same sex marriage legal, congratulations' . Then that's just you ignoring the evidence.
"Can a korean liquor store owner discriminate against a black shopper?"  
Well if they don't server liquor to ANYONE, and a black shopper comes in and says, I don't care if you only want to server BEER AND WINE, I'm black and you must server me vodka.  Then YES, the Korean liqour store owner is CORRECT to insist that they won't server that customer, because they don't do that.
It's actually pretty simple, but that's not what you want.  You want concessions, and you want government to force them.
Again, it's not persecution when you encounter someone who doesn't want to perform a particular service FOR ANYONE.  And crossing the street?  Guess what, black people see black people and they cross the street, because their racists? No, because they are not stupid, and they want to increase their safety.

removing reviews is a regulated activity, everyone who left a review should file a complaint with the better business bueru or wherever such a complaint would be lodged (i have no idea)

Firstly, operating a business which provides services which do not violate your own faith is not some horrible discrimination.
There is no threat of shortage of cake baking services that would cause any sane person to become distraut.
What if I want to have a cake which say's "hail satan, lucifer is my savior!"
You expect me to be able to have that cake baked for me by someone who i voluntarily encounter, everyone who runs a bakery must bow down before my concerns or it's discrimination.
You have been conditioned to believe garbage.  If I cannot find someone to bake that cake, you know what I should do as a non asshole?  bake it myself, or buy a blank and decorate it myself.
You want the government involved in dictating that you cannot run a business unless it puts a bull mounting a cow on the cake.
It's just nature, if you think it's obscene you shouldn't have opened a bakery!

I would say either, but again.  Roger's position is that CSW faked the fraud to lessen the chances of getting tracked down for his stash.

Perhaps it's actually just those holes which are there which show the facade of logic in your argument.
If a example of HALAL, **some** muslims by matter of practicing their faith contend that the slaughter MUST be done in the manner.  And they cannot in good faith provide meat which is not prepared 'properly'.
 **some** christians by matter of practicing their faith contnd that the slaughter MUST NOT be done in the halal manner as it's deamed inhumane **or whatever**.
You want to pick sides and say that your version is correct and that the other side should be coerced to serve non halal meat to a christian customer who has no real need to purchase from the particular store since deli's are ubiquitous.
Saying they have never offered it?  It's meat, as a christian customer, how is that a thing you can provide to muslim customers prepared in the manner they prefer, but when a christian comes in, it's not available.
THAT IS THE SAME EXACT THING.
EXACT SAME THING.

It's how they are going about it.
At the run up to Aug 1, they were fumbling over the course of four reversal blogs communications about supporting not supporting etc.
They caused many to pull their coins so that they weren't lost, then they said they will issue them to account holders but they are holding them hostage for months.
They're are a lot of reasons against them at this point being an honest company serving it's customers.
point being, bitcoin is not impervious to failure, the whole shebang could go down the toilet if enough screwyness happens during gestation.

Serving sinners is different than participating in the advertisement of the 'suppossed sin'.  You keep repeating that I've failed to show how.
Again, he did not discriminate against them because they are gay.
He DOES NOT want to participate in decorating the cake with two grooms.  Has nothing to do with the customers being gay.  You fail at thinking.
Muslim clerics perform marriages.  So do priests.  You want to cherry pick who you boss around.
I don't want to make discrimination legal.  I want idiots to not be in charge, and that means you and government busy bodies talking about **persecution** of not getting a damn cake how you want from the one shop you have to go out of your way to find instead of the almost universally gay friendly or gay run bakeries.

You know why?  Because a 1972 FORD PINTO is a SPECIFIC THING and it AINiT BITCOIN.
Just because they had a propensity to blow up when rear ended doesn't mean Bitcoin is a 1972 FORD PINTO.
Bernie Madoff was running a ponzi, you know **WHY** it was a ponzi?  Because people were getting paid **returns** on the 'investment' which were EXACTLY JUST other peoples investment.

Coinbase flubbed the Aug 1st communications around BCH four times with conflicting 'blog' posts.  They can't seem to get a consistent communications strategy around wth they are doing in regard to it.
And then they go and start attempting to service trades on it, again in contradiction to their already scatter brained communications regarding what they would support it as.
And there is no reason to make excuses for them, as an exchange, they would have incentive to let people know in advance that the BCH is going to start trading and provide the date.

You insist on ignoring the facts.  The cake would not be decorated **FOR ANYONE** in that manner.
You cannot accept this because it would negate all the discrimination accusations.  No one gets the cake decorated like that from them, thus no discrimination.
You can argue that's bad for society etc, but it's NOT DISCRIMINATION.
I've repeated it several times, the baker has a right to engage in a business of baking cakes, without infringing on the practice of their faith.  That means they have a right to bake cakes and decorate them.
Going to the bakery and requesting a cake with "hail statan, god lucifer is my savior" would be turned away, NOT BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION.
You just insist that you aren't hearing anything cohesive from me, but that's because you want to be correct when you are not.
I have shown you how the baker has been coerced to abdicate the practice of his faith by the government.  You say they are not harmed, but that is bullshit.  They don't have to bake every kind of cake any customer comes through the door wanting just because they offer a SIMILAR CAKE in the eyes of the fake disgruntled activity phoney.
By your logic, any muslim cleric in this country should be FORCED TO preside over a gay marriage because they should NOT discriminate.

You say I am confusing the issue.  That is just you framing it how it suits you.
If they don't want to provide a SPECIFIC service, then that is not discrimination.  It would not have mattered if it was a man and a woman wanting two grooms on the cake.  They don't want to make a cake with two grooms on it.  You have predetermined your preferred outcome, and won't be swayed.
You are wrong, and millions of americans join you.  Congratulations, same sex legal.
Big whoop, thanks for getting the government involved with pushing your bullshit, now a person has to choose between baking cakes as a business and practicing their faith.  The bakery was not denying baking them a cake or selling them a cake.  
They did not want to decorate it in a way which THEY consider a violation of their faith.
YOU ARE DISCRIMINATING BY FORCING THEM TO ABANDON THEIR FAITH FOR A MADE UP ARGUMENT WHEN THERE ARE gay bakeries all over the place, no matter what angle you come at this.  You are wrong.

That is the primary point of the video.
You say it's all pretty simple, yet you imply that you don't understand.
In your terms:  bitcoin will provide the demand for solar and wind (or any supplier) such that they are not in any need to sell cheaper 'while they can produce it'  they can sell at full rate because they can have 100% demand all the time they need.
This makes solar and wind (not at all my choice...) more viable (than currently) and more investments into the tech can be made due to REAL economy, not just subsidies.

Thanks for the info, while it is good that you can use money which has been laundered.  In my perfect world, you wouldn't make laundering illegal, as there is already the act which necessitates the laundering being illegal.  Otherwise laundering wouldn't be attempted since the money is clean.  The original illegal act is what should be prosecuted.  I know this seems difficult and impracticle at times, so instead the government just goes and says, well we can't catch you doing illegal things, but you must be guilty so we will claim legal things are also illegal so that we can catch you doing that.
How can they prove the money was laundered if they cannot prove the illegal thing which precurses it?

Are you trying to contradict me or your post I replied to?
I took your "I suppose you think they are all millennials and mom/pops?" to mean you were implying these 13 million customer accounts would be not small by inferring you to be giving an example of small accounts.
I know 10k is not that large, but it is larger than millenials and mom/pops I would say.  I was pointing out that even then, it doesn't add up to much.  And for every 4 or 5 investing 100$ you'll be needing 1 to invest 50,000 to 60,000 given that's 6 people there doing that 130 billion.
If nobody now is a ground floor investor then that is evidence in the direction AWAY from a bubble.  This is because in that scenario no one has incentive to sell for massive gains.
I know you think otherwise.  But it's moot since yes there are whales and yeah they could decide the jig is up.
Whether it's a bubble or not, the reality is there are some massive gains involved for a few which if they decided to exit, would have downward price pressure to a massive amount.

The point is that the power plant can be right-sized for the projected needs without trying to compromise and balance against economic viability in the short term.  This is achievable because the power plant can be sized as need and have assured demand to purchase any power generated but not needed yet by the local area.  This demand is highly mobile so that once the local area increases it's needs, the demand just moves on to elsewhere.
The notion that power is wasted is just a non critical assumption which does not have basis in reality.
Power is everywhere, making it into a 'useful' form is a challenge, but not of any significant herculean amount.
If the power plants do not have to be economically viable under the artificial constraint of the local area demands-curve, then they are that much more feasible economically.
This means cheaper power for everyone.
You probably disagree, but I will just point you to evaluate all the things that you know and categorize them into, 'i really know this' and 'i believe i know this'...

you are wrong in many ways, but since you are surrounded with like minded people you are comfortable and believe how right you are
wasted energy is equated with not providing significant "enough"? benefit to people?
That's hardly a given, but if you want to use that definition then fine.
Someone can 'waste energy' aka just purchase it, thus making the economics of power generation **different**.
The point is that difference makes it possible to correctly size the generation to the actual projected needs without concern for immediate needs, the plant can garantuee 100% sales of the larger plant even though the local demand is less at the moment.  This changes what types of plants are viable.
That would be a sophisticated, analytical approach to understanding and modeling the forces involved.
More demand would FOR EXAMPLE mean solar and wind would not have to sell off at lower prices when the going is good, unlike coal which does not have to worry about it...
elipses . thus making solar and wind as just examples MORE competitive with coal, thus making them MORE viable
anyhow all this is horseshit because nuclear is ONLY POLITICALLY nonviable

Two grooms on the cake doesn't violate the bakers rights, forcing the baker to perform the act of putting two grooms on the cake **does** violate his rights.

I don't care that they are gay either, but you don't care about the baker and have the shear incompetence to claim that forcing a baker to participate in advocacy of ceremonies counter to his religious faith is discrimination, **not of the baker** but of the fake outraged activists...

thanks for the citation, yes, i have cold storage, i got all the coins off coinbase pre aug 1 and have since sold those bch for btc at 300$ each when btc was 2800, so it's rather academic to me on this particular instance.
Your concern that it is risky reporting is duly noted.
Couple of things though.  There are hundreds of forks of bitcoin, also airdrops for example did you know that you have byteballs which are being allocated at full moons or somesuch time?  Also, anyone can fork the chain at anytime and sell one new coin to their buddy for 1000$, now not being listed on the exchanges that you frequent, are you going to be filing taxes for income of 1000$ per coins?  The answer is obviously no, you and no one else is because it is essentially impossible to take on that task.  BCH is just popular but it is not even remotely close to the only fork which is granting 'coins' to each btc address holder at the time of it's creation.  Once you sell that BCH or that obscure one of hacker fork, then you will incur income and you would then also have to include the calculated basis price.
Anyhow, I'm not arguing against those rulings since they do not apply to this asset class.

The mining is moved, physically to the power plant, co located.

thanks for the info,
You realize not all accountants are in agreement.  In any case, you and I can argue, but it won't change what the IRS will do.
In my opinion, which I am standing by, and any IRS audit will do nothing.
The BCH is not a dividend, it is the product of an asset which has not been sold yet.  The cost basis I will use is to subtract it out from the basis I paid for BTC.
I am not going to bullshit and act like money was created out of thin air.  If I buy 1 BTC for 100$ and get 1 BCH later, and then sell.
My cost basis is 100$ and I will spread it to BTC and BCH at the ratio of the coins at the date of Aug 1.
So selling BTC at 200$ and BCH at 50$, yields me 150$ profit, and that ratio is just there for which one has which basis.
That is solid, I'll be putting my papers where my mouth is on that one.
That BCH value came out of BTC, BTC would be worth more if it were not for BCH diluting it.

take a step back, let's say they test it and find a bug.  You would say they should fix it, because you want it to not be rushed, and untested and premature.
Well, what if they find a 'bug' in the design of blocksize increase itself.  They 'test' it and find that it is untenable, should they just ignore that and decide, well it was a good idea, let's continue forward ignoring the discovery of this problem and proceed to release?
No of course not, they are not incompetent.  They are engineers and the technicals where the rubber meets the road do matter.
Block size increase is not just a think it and it shall be done, there are real consequences.
And it is NOT scaling anyway.  There is nothing other than marketing to link it to scaling.  No assurances can be had that the blocksize increase would not result in just as full blocks almost immediately afterwards anyway.
Any proponents of block size increase seem to always poo poo segwit, which is also enabling larger blocks...
It's just not adding up to a reasonable 'debate'.

I am aware of the society we live in.
You are incorrect about arbitrarily denying service, as are the idiot judges.

They are willing to bake a cake and sell a cake and decorate a cake.
They are not willing to make a cake that says 'jeffrey dahlmer is my lucifer god'.
But you get distracted with your inability to apply logic, and think you are correct just because my example sounds absurd.
Well guess what, the straight couple cannot get a cake with two grooms on it from the bakery either, because **guess what** it's not about any discrimination against **anyone** it's about not putting messages on cakes which run counter to their faith.
I know you can't admit this, because well, you like you be right.  But you are not right, you just have idiot judges in your camp.

take a breath
this concept of 'waste' that you say, have you thought maybe you are not that familiar with it?
what is it?
it's not possible to 'waste' energy in the physics sense, so you mean then in some other sense...?  so in the econonomics realm, if the electricity is available it's because it was harvested from the environment by other mechanisms, wasting it is just using it one way or another
you are **not** correct on this 'waste' concept, but alas 97% of you all agree that it's possible to waste it, sigh..............
again, which is it? prices are going to rise? prices are going to fall?  let me just set the record straight, prices will fall due to bitcoin.
How?  because the demand will bring a larger more liquid market for electricity
electricity prices will go down due to bitcoin
it's counter intuitive, but that is what will happen, and it's not really counter intuitive if you understand what actually is happening in an electric power plant................................

If you increase the blocks, then the price would fall according to blocksize increase proponents, but they fail to ever explain why with lower fees wouldn't the transaction counts go up.  And thus the fees would rise because, again, the blocks would be full.

in the video you posted you can clearly see and quite clearly hear the impact from a full windup bat of some sort to the bumper.
there is another video which is extremely graphic which shows the impact from the point of view of the rear passenger side and in that video there are 8 guys on his car with bats immediately after impact like 1 or 2 seconds, indicative of being chased ALREADY
no attempts to help the guy out of the car who just got into head on collision, in their minds he is evil and guilty and should die and this is before impact

during each HF the users have to decide: "am i on the correct one.?"
social engineering can get the crowd using bch and can get others to not sell hoping to hedge, which just weakens the BTC regardless of which one is the one to go with in your solution.

@_date: 2017-08-15 06:45:54
I think you may have a few errors in your understanding.
Mining is not based on demand, they can mine 'empty' blocks, which would be blocks with no transactions.
Also, the part about freezing supply as well as the demand.  This does not sound correct for example as shown by the case of the non investor, they put their 10k into something else and only do some transactions with BTC, you would not say their 10K has reduced demand of BTC and every other instrument.  There may be better ways to illustrate this, but I think the point stands.  Investors/holders are freezing part of the supply only, they are not freezing demand, they are identical in that regard to every person who may not have funds available because of 'other' investments or lack of funds altogether.  If you come to know this, it may help you in your future deliberations.

won't 2mb blocks just fill up almost immediately?  miners use spam to pad the demand in order to turn up the fee on the non spam includes.
also even without spam, 2mb reduces fee cost right? thats the supposed point, but then trivial stuff like weddings show up and fill that gap thus raising prices (thats the economic part 2mb backers should be able to address even if its just to say we dont think so, but they omit mention of it almost like they are not being forthwright)

again, i think this is just how you're used to communicating or something ................
'by definition are more wasteful', there you have already glossed over and mistook 'by definition' if you say this then be accurate.  it's not by definition that its more wasteful, centralized databases do not have the same properties, and so you saying 'waste' is just the cost,
I agree with your second paragraph, but to term it as waste is not accurate.  If you perform that 'work' in centralized system to avoid the 'waste' then the result is not having the same characteristics, so you have just not incurred the same cost and not encountered the same result.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:18:42

It's one thing to recognize there is spam, it is another thing to do something to prevent the spam.
It IS important to know that there is spam happening if it is, regardless of it the plan is to let it continue.
One reason is that knowing the transactions are spam will change the decisions which come from arguments about mempool being full and what it implies about what changes to incorporate into the network.

No, if spam is constant the increase in rate is zero.
say there are 100 spam and 20 non spam each hour, then every hour there is 120, and the mempool grows at a constant amount. if 90 per hour can be handled then every hour the mempool grows by 30.

yes 15% of 4 million spread out over however many years it takes to keep below threshold, should be fine! would be 600k but due to likely further increases he will still likely be able to get more than 4 million out after taxes which will be aggregated to more also but yes he won just dont cash all at once

now your cost basis for btc is 25/34 of its original cb
your cost basis of bch is 9/34 of original BTC cb
now sell bch at 600
write it off as a loss of 3/34 original BTC cost basis
if the irs comes at you tell them to fuk off, you were robbed by the bch clowns

at this point, your perspective just comes across as NOT analytical
everyone has heard many times "there's no downside to going to 2x"
Most here disagree with that.
Also, miners didn't go along with anything. 
They follow the money.  It does not take two brain cells to know how to pay the electricity and internet connection and plug in a bunch of computers that you got with capital.  Yeah there are some other stuff related to being an actual business.  Mining is not complicated, yet you purport they have this skillful perspective on the way forward.  They do not.

engineering is about tradeoffs in the hard sciences, materials, physics, mathematics.
it is not about strategy within socially maneuvered factions and solving problems via rhetoric

most of the time he also said bitcoin cash including when ver incorrectly repeated the bs that bitcoin cash would be bitcoin once the chain length is longest, and the interviewer corrects him on the protocol and says 'no it would be bitcoin cash'

Longest chain is only for within a single protocol, and Ver knows it.
He just refuses to say it.

you cite forbes?
that site is a glorified blogger bulletin board
let me just point out to you that "Morcos and other contributors" is BS
DO YOU READ THESE ARTICLES?
perhaps you are inclined to not have reading comprehension, or perhaps you are just misrepresenting the content?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:10:38
plenty have copied and pasted the code, and plenty of reasons they haven't replaced btc
but don't let empirical evidence get in the way of objectivity...
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:11:05
thats all sales talk buddy
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:09:38
you obviously need to understand what the fuck you're about to do a little better before doing anything...
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:06:17
people say btc all the time and so what anyway it's anecdotal
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:41:02
you are a liar

the internet is here, the information flow is sped up
thinking that things are the same and patterns always apply is a way to not put analysis in
the dips this year have happened but they've all been less than a week
 
we were at 5500 a month ago
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:46:53
it would not, there are transfer fees of the particular exchange and that is different than the *transaction* fee of moving between addresses
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:30
thats all the dollar is, it's just that the dollar is rediculously poor at it
seriously, think about it
what is the dollar other than a store of value?
and if you feel you have thought about that, then next question is, is it any good at that? or is it shitty af
seriously, serious....

government run amok 
20 years (to life) for shoplifting

segwit2x is that hack...
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:58:00
yeah good luck getting a software developer job without a degree...

you still have 15$ tho...
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:44:39
that was a rise of 100x
we are currently in a rise of around 7x to 9x
kinda **not** the same thing
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:38:49
your point is not relevant
there are heroes and villains
what you are saying is that you haven't picked sides, but you clearly have
constant forks are good?  bro you slow
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:36:47
your opinion is not hard to understand
it's just flawed
for example, btc liquidity is much higher than bch, where it often takes hours for a single block
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:23:06
is it potentially you that has increased exuberancy?
i mean seriously, comparing 100x gain to 8x gain...
it has been 4 years, 8x gain in 4 years on a networking effect based asset does not sound exuberant at all to me, and perhaps you are just noticing that within those increased numbers of participants, the exuberant ones are more vocally prolific, just putting that out there for you...
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:55:17
the math works out, blocksiz increase is not a solution to high fees
it's not complicated, sometimes people are just wrong
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:16:41

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:12:37
if you want to continue to think 1x or 2x or even 8x or 32x is scaling, then i cannot help you

aside from the name, why cant btc stay btc regardless and b2x stay b2x regardless of what 'bitcoin' label gets attatched...
seems obvious to me....
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:17:41
if i had anything smart to say to core, i'm sure they would take it into consideration
not the same with nya,  you know this....
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:54:33
they were against it because it was a dangerous change to the stability of the network
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:40:14
there may also be technical disadvantages i bch which are insurmountable...
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:03:14

percentages yeah
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:40:04
what in the history of the world can you point to which supports the claim that they aren't still scheming?
you must be young
they are just acknowledging that they concluded their takeover would likely fail and be too costly to attempt (increased risk due to costs)
all that verbiage about the community blah blah, that is just there to appease you
they are fully commited to a takeover and are now back behind closed doors scheming to do **exactly that**
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:23:32
people haven't believed the world was flat like you were taught in school, that was just lies your gov baby sitters told you
just like the inside job smear
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:23
that's for tax reasons
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:01:29
yet they allow you here to make people aware... so credible
also, the miners have never been the executive branch.
They are just performing a job which has been placed into the public market, and they are paid for it.
Your beef with Blockstream is quaint.
Anything you imagine to be a problem with them will be a million times worse in a seg2x world...

that is part of the point of this meme
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:17:50
that makes sense kind of, however right now each user needs their own transaction to move to segwit for example, so maybe it makes sense to move the funds sooner rather than later so that it's not stuck

i am able to consider, i have
as i have stated, i have and shown some thought
like for example the things that would need to be in place
sounds like you have not put much thought into it at all, just a case of flippant what goes up must come down
again,  what would it look like to have slow decline?  it may be in slow growth now for the next straight 5 years
with no 'correction'
there may be accumulation happening from pools which have zero need to 'panic sell' as the folklore would have you believe

@_date: 2017-11-09 06:36:06
do you have ANY evidence to support your claim that on chain scaling is a must?
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:11:44
"What makes you think this is supposed to be true?"
Nothing, just a guess trying to understand, thinking that i'm missing something about how the fees are supposed to sustain the miners when LN is included.
"Base layer fees will remain affordable, and inside channel fees will be much much cheaper."
It's not clear to me why base layer fees would not end up being higher to account for less overall but with the same need to sustain the network, why the base layer tx would not be higher until some equilibreum is met.
Is it that base layer would still be like 5$ or whatever but then the LN transactions would be like a penny but since their are millions and millions of them it adds up?  In other words an LN channel pays some normal base layer tx fee to open and close, but then also some potentially larger amount due to the sheer volume of aggregated 2nd layer txs within?
 "Miners don't need to be paid 20 bitcoins per block when bitcoin is $100k or $1m. They will have to do with 1 btc per block, for example."
This makes sense to me for the next 123 years or so, but after that the tx need to take over i guess.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:21:41
they were using a simile
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:04:22

just keep listing BTC as what it is, and B2X as the rule change,
seems damn obvious to me, but maybe i'm just old fashioned
then if they want to call B2X Bitcoin, so be it, at least the assets are properly tradeable!

NO WAY, they are scheming and you are trying to convert people to be useful idiots
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:52:33

i'm not with it enough to be out in case it shoots up, just finished the in coming at 6400, earlier had waited for four weeks of steady climb for a dip and bought at 4800, couple days before the dip to 3k
had thought, i keep waiting for the dip it would have to be 30% to make up for the rise, but then it happened and i had no powder
anyway right now similar, i'm in and we are approaching dip time, but it's too risky for me to be out (since i'm just a long)

tranfer to a peper wallet then to a different exchange if needed to sell
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:34:30
i agree with those points
regarding btc, i think there is a point in the future when the price has risen enough to stabilize and at that time if the user transactions have not increased in quantity enough then btc will start to fall in price
when that time comes and what price, i have really have no way to get a good guess but my instinct says that is a few years out and would be a window afterwhich it will either catch on or fail, until then the window has not opened for business and it's just price trying to get to stabilization phase
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:55:49
thats all fine and dandy, i don't really care if they screw up, i care that their screw ups are going to affect me in a negative way
and you would be wiser to comprehend that a mass of people getting screwed by bch will not be a neutral event towards you investment
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:05:13
it is a chinese knock off! yes thanks for the appropriate terminology
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:12:43
short answer ABSOLUTELY!
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:37:51
it's not that complicated, they may believe in their own 'product' and just want to steal a better brand for it
seems pretty lame to me, but the two are independant, could be a bad product or a good product, creating market confusion and misleading customers with a cheap knockoff is orthogonal

@_date: 2017-11-14 00:53:21
i think the issue that is not being addressed here is once fees go up so much for on chain transactions is it thought that the base price has gone up too in order to make it possible?
in other words, if i wait and still have basic btc in 5 years, am i going to be paying a high percentage of that as the fee to move it to LN or other?

you aren't trading one good for another with the dollar
with the dollar you are trading one good for a dollar and then taking the dollar and trading it for a good
in other words, storing the value of the first good until such time as you have gotten to the second good at which time you release the value to the new owner and take the second good

@_date: 2017-11-14 15:12:56
Perhaps I've not articulated it very well.  I'm not concerned about fees right now.
I'm concerned about fees later.  If you say that part of the point is that base layer fees are still relatively cheap then it's solves my concern which is just being late to exit the base layer.
However, I don't see how that would work because without the fees going up how would miners make their money after the halving?
The way I am guessing it:
base layer fees + channel open/close fees (base layer) + inside channel fees ==&gt; needs to be greater than current mining rewards
so is it that the inner channel fees just add up by sheer numbers but somehow the base layer fees remain affordable???
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:01:07

i've been weary since 3k and it's a damn challenge believe me, but my timeline is multi year, and while i may not have as much powder for the dip, i missed the mid july one down to 1850 thinking it might go lower, well that didn't happen and then i realised my upside target is farther from this price than the 0 on the other side
i watched the plateau at 2500, 3000, 3300, 4000... the dip i need now would be 20% to get back to where i last started waiting for it... 
now if it dips 50% 70%, i won't be able to take advantage of it and that sucks, but if it doesn't dip i'd be in worse shape

I guess the thing I am trying to state is that the 'Responsible Disclosure' only goes so far, and as has been demonstrated is not enough.
Because it is not followed, and thus cannot be relied on.
There needs to be a nimble development process in place which can allieviate whatever amount it can of the reliance on "Responsible Disclosure", because there are spills and there always will be and dev needs to keep that in mind before getting down the road of a huge change blocking any immediate need.  And again as this was not an immediate need, then they should understand the agency of chjj to come to that SAME conclusion..

"Only mankind's collective effort to sabotage the banking system gives Bitcoin a chance in the first place."
There are multiple things which give it a chance not just this.  One thing is that the distributed ledger.
"Remember that in theory, banks are more efficient than Bitcoin. "

but it's ok for some core devs to claim they know about the issue for months and that it was already fixed before chjj found out and notified them over two months ago, so they admit chjj is not even the first to discover it, yet to be comfortable with their release schedule they chose to rest the security on some agreement to not share it further, meanwhile others discovery process is unhindered

No speculative bubble in the history of the world has had even a hundredth of mental effort put into it.  Bitcoin has hundreds of genius level engineers working tirelessly for years on evolving it and improving it.
This cannot be overlooked in analysis which seeks to predict any outcome.

bch chain is longer already, you and many others are not correctly narrowing the definition

"There is simply no way of knowing."
But there are ways of estimating, and in the end this is just one more out of an infinite number of things to estimate concerning btc and the level of confidence of the esimate might just be 'not much'.

I wrote too sloppily, my apologies.
I do realize that, I come to different conclusions.
I would cry foul you are correct.
The point I'm making is that core should expect also people to cry foul if the "critical" bug is not addressed as THE priority.
Seems like they thought it was not important enough to drop everything and release just that, or it was too much of an undertaking.  That's fine, but why did things get into the state where they cannot be nimbly addressed?  I don't know, but at some point you have to ask why is it we can have a hubub over some kid with a laptop?
I am serious, and if anyone thinks this is a quick answer they haven't thought about it.

i agree with you, but unfortunately strictly speaking 'implemented a fix' is different than 'i fixed it' . i am annoyed by sloppy 'implemented' claims before too as i don't think it's the common way to communicate
but think of this, 'implemented a sha256 algorithm' . kindof vague, which one was 'implemented'?  oh the burt et al one....
it's a bit of a stretch if those files have the comments needed and there isn't more damning communication outside of this
claiming to have fixed it before core sounds pretty bs to me when lifting cores code, but again maybe they mean it's not fixed until it is deployed,
as a user that's what i want, compiled deployed................

i was speaking of the economy as a beast unto itself, a consumer economy feasts on spending, people saving is like withholding its food
people benefit from saving, then eventually the consumer economy would have to adapt and become driven by innovation (as in new stuff that makes peoples lives better than their savings) instead of blind consumption

this may be the kicker to get it booted out of court: "I think you'd have a very difficult time in court proving that coinbase is committing any sort of fraud, especially since they are telling you publicly what they plan on doing."
however that being said your analogy is not appropriate to the situation for a number of reasons. 
1)seg2x is not the rules which bitcoin is, and people already own the original bitcoin, when they go to sell their bitcoin now they must sell it under a different name, one which will assuredly not have the same price status

"sounds like..." in that case core wants to have the fix roll out at the schedule while knowing that at least one other independent discovery has occurred, and then expects that any agreements with said party are in any way related to actual security, after 70 days with multiple codebases doing the fix and even the event organizers knowing, it cannot be said this is a tight ship
i support dev, but not going to think they are impervious to mistakes in judgement
this bug may have been difficult to fix, maybe..  but it "sounds like..." from a code review perspective it was absurdly obvious, and then they 'fix' it, and start getting external notification of the bug, and still think well our release schedule would be impacted by putting just this fix out so we will resort to dealmaking with a 'friendly' and then 70 days later try to divert attention onto them for having independent agency
no one cut the mic no one interrupted, no one really takes real steps, just grandstanding "i'm going to ask this really hard hitting gotcha once this talk is finished..."
it's just one little thing in the fluff column for the event, right there alongside the musk rocket

On another note though, this is not confidence inspiring from your link posted:

Well, you can read up on it yourself, the tulips that is.
You won't gain any credibility with BTC investors who know about the tulips because you are already spouting of myths and mischaracterizations.

not so fast buddy, what do you think speculators are attempting? and what do you think they are doing to the price?
you are wrong that 1M does not affect until it hits the order books
"Other than that, it's not like people think the price should be X because Y coins are lost. People sell and buy at the best price that's currently available to them."
yah, sure.  but it doesn't speak to the issue, it's not relevant

$100,000price / $5,900price == 16.949152542372881x

you could consider whether the conclusions at the end of this megapost really follow from it
you say "There’s absolutely no reason why Bitcoin – or anything else – can’t serve as a currency if enough people accept it as such. "
That is just BS, I'm not even going to bother listing out all the reasons.
Liberty coin has some reasons...
More BS: "You might want to consider whether a real currency can do that, or whether speculative buying is determining Bitcoin’s price. And whether what’s gone up can come down."
BTC price will stabilize once it elevates to it's natural level.  The volatility right now is from the exhausting march to that position.
Maybe it is this author that might want to consider whether a real thesis can do that, mainly write a bunch of BS and then come to some post some pre conclusions that do not follow at the end.

i guess that you may be aware, as you seem intelligent, but perhaps not aware by your statements, I can't tell if you are deliberately mistaking this ploy for a serious debunkment
two things:
1) me not knowing those details in no way logically goes to show that I could not in fact know the things you state i am unnable to account for (because they are not needed on the path to that knowledge) . yeah i don't know really how vitamin C works either
2) those details are not even needed to be understood nor even shown to be participating or independent in anyway
i suggest taking some time to understand discrete math
then work in some applied statistical analysis

"FDA’s new import tool kit will have a huge impact on food safety given that an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. food supply is imported, including 50 percent of fresh fruits, 20 percent of fresh vegetables and 80 percent of seafood."
for edification in case you are mathematically disinclined, **15%** of the food supply is imported
here is a big country: china

agreed, however another option is to just give yourself an allowance and stick to it
sell say 500$ a week unless you have 2x your allowance, then just skip selling that 500$ that week
in a year you would have sold ~180k at most and likely much less than 90k
and your remaining btc would be 2-3x

All throughout history and in current times there are examples of people who are acting as very bad actors, even though they are surrounded by others who are not.  Why are they like this?  I don't know, but one of the few legitimate purposes of government (which it fails miserably at in obvious ways) is to prevent bad actors from injuring good actors.

I think the main question is will it survive the onslaught of forks.
It might be that the fork is the good idea and path.
It might be the the fork is the premature "leeeroooy jenkkkkkinnsssssssss!"  and everything gets f'd.
If it survives and grows, it will become useful as a currency, if it is destroyed before it gets there then what destroyed it may not necessarily get there either.

it may sound extreme, but i'm taking exception with the does nothing just wastes electricity part node doing nothing if your not transacting
what it is doing is recording the ledger locally, this provides you with the ability to come out of the cryptolypse with a copy that you trust, which you would be able to use to compare against other nodes you may encounter in the wild

if you want to set asside merit based hiring, you need a plan

here's a thought: teach dumb kids geometry so they are not disadvantaged along that vector, oh wait you say there is more?
yeah like diet, stable non violent safety in home etc

it's not fear mongering to call out incorrect statements.
such as this incorrect statement: "If 2X occurs with 90% hashrate, it will be like nothing ever happened and wallets don't even need to upgrade."

it is you who needs to stick with it and gather the additional info

when others are buying btc as a store of value, the hodler with value exchanges some of their btc so that they can make a purchase like food 
this cycle repeats and is not 'cashing out' as in selling their btc for the purpose of having $

the core dev team will decide what they think,
meanwhile you will decide what you think and obviously have
 bitcoin transactions are going through just fine now

Compromise is not a fitting term for the situation.
