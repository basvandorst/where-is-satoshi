maybe.  but once they realize no laws are being broken it will be all good.  Hopefully no one will get shot in the process

I agree, i think in the morning there will be a lot of depressed people.  Although if miners hold a large portion of the total coins they could at least somewhat make sure the price stay profitable if everyone stays smart and doesnt sell mined coins for a value that is less than profitable

Makes sense.  Its official we can get all three with bitcoins,  drugs, sex, and rock n roll

i think you are missing the point. Circuit breakers trip at a certain number of amps. If you try to run a 60 A get up through  a 50 A breaker you might get 5 seconds of mining before it trips.  Unless you want to spend all of your time standing beside your circuit breaker flipping it every 10 seconds you might want to mine within your available means.

I'm not trying to say im a genius, i am not for sure. But i probably know more about power than most people posting here.

you are not a good friend. 
I understand your point, just saying

Yes, but this is the most basic defense.  Don't have wallet on computer when wallet don't need to be on computer.

awwwww poo.  Where does one find such details?

I just got my rig up and running not too long, just a 5830.  Assuming an exchange rate of 24 USD at the current difficult it will take me about 40 days to pay it off.  So it will be more than that due to difficulty increase.  I will pay it off, but at that point my per day profit will be lower, but who knows what the exchange rate will do between now and then.  
So i would say you can pay it off, but profit may be pretty low from then on.  Or you'll be dancing when the exchange rate hits $100.  Its a gamble

then just freaking upvote him.  Nobody freaking cares if you knew/ were going to say the same thing.

Bad plan.  Mostly because of cpu mining.  If you want to scam your company id say take your work computer (assuming you have one) and put a graphics card in it. You will make more than 30 machines cpu mining (card dependent of course), minimal cost, and the electricity use of 1 machine  will probably go unnoticed.

well if hes smart it wont be traceable to him.  But i agree its stupid to put any effort into getting multiple machines to cpu mine

the price is whatever people are willing to pay, they don't decide the price the traders do
@_date: 2011-06-15 04:59:39
ah you are right. the first calculation is the correct one.  
567358*1.514786= 859426, which means 51.4786% increase

Personally id call it bitter sweet.  I think they will get more over all donations, some people seem to not always treat bitcoins as exactly like money, by which i mean they will easily part with say 0.1BTC for whatever reason when they wouldnt consider paying dollars for it.
But yes i would suspect this might add some pressure.

Ya unfortunately like you said there will always be someone willing to do business with the person.  I suppose this is a draw back to being decentralized, there is no laws.  Maybe one day you could call the police for this kind of thing.  But I'd say right now this is no where in sight.  Government pressure could also stop police from dealing with such things
