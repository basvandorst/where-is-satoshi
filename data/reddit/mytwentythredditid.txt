FWIW, consider trading the BTC for litecoin, monero, or some other altcoin (that's a GOOD altcoin, not some shitcoin). The reason being, the trading values have been pretty stable for the last 3 months. People aren't selling their altcoin holdings to then sell the bitcoin for cash anymore (this was happening when we were stable at 10k for a while, you could see the altcoin trading ratios dropping slowly while btc stayed flat).
Now, BTC is dropping but altcoins are staying flat. Most of the smart money is moving into alts from BTC, and that's what is (probably) driving the value crash atm. If money were flowing out entirely you'd expect to see both crash at the same time because the buy-pressure for alts would go away.
Anywho, trade your btc for an alt, wait for the trading ratio to go up (NOT THE PRICE!!!) and then sell back into BTC. A step-by-step guide, in case you don't understand:
**Disclaimer: This example uses XMR purely because I need to make an example with something, and out of all the possible altcoins, I personally don't feel like XMR is a horrible idea. Maybe not the best, but not terrible. LTC is probably the safest bet, but I am not a financial advisor and this is purely speculation shared for your education.**
1. Go to  and check the 'BTC' checkbox above the top-left corner of the graph, a gold line will appear.
2. Write down the value of the gold line (.00704738 @ Nov 25 2019 00:59:53). Note that the gold line is above the blue line, this means monero is currently on a discount when buying with BTC versus USD.
3. HODL for a few months.
4. If the value of the gold line has increased (say it's now .010), go ahead and sell back to BTC for a nice 41.8% gain. IE 1 BTC -&gt; XMR @ .007, then XMR -&gt; BTC @ .01 == 1.428 BTC.
5. HODL or sell the BTC for even more potential profit (or loss).
Blue/gold line explanation:
* On Nov 24, 2019 @ 14:54:59 the BTC price for monero was .00693551 and the USD price was $48.82. BTC's USD price at that time was $7057.30.
* Spending 10 BTC on monero would get you 1,441.8550330112709807930491052569 XMR.
* Spending $70,573 (10 BTC worth of USD at the same date/time) on XMR directly would get you 1,445.5755837771405161818926669398 XMR.
Thus, you want to buy from whichever line is higher. Blue line higher == buy XMR with $, gold line higher == buy XMR with BTC.
Alternatively, don't sweat such a small detail and lose out on &lt; 1% price differences. :p
But what about selling?
If you have 1500 XMR to sell:
* You'd be able to sell it directly to USD for $73,230
* You'd be able to sell it to BTC for 10.403265, and then exchange that for $73,418.96 {more realistically, probably $73,300 after fees).
So for selling, Blue line on top ==&gt; Sell XMR to BTC, then BTC to USD. Gold line on top ==&gt; Sell XMR directly to USD.
How far apart the lines are *can* matter, but outside of crazy swings (great times to sell!) they are normally within 1-3% of each other.

Both. Computer Science will, mostly, teach you how to be a programmer who understands hardware. If you find that you don't enjoy programming as a career, you can pivot into devops/infrastructure admin roles with relative ease.
Computer engineering will be a more difficult field to breach. There are not many companies in the world that make computer hardware, and those that do tend to be either small (&lt; 1000 employees) or in China. But, if you can find a job, there is a LOT of hardware being created. So it would be wrong to think that it's hard to find a job as a computer engineer; rather, it will be hard to live where you want *and* be a computer engineer, unless you happen to want to live in China, Silicon Valley, Boston, Chicago, or NYC. Few other cities will have CE jobs.

Within 5 years? Yea. Will it stay there? No. Will the new ATH be 100k or larger? Yes. I had been predicting the next ATH would occur in either 2021 or 2020. With the 13k surge we saw, I don't know anymore. I have no idea how long the 'reset' period after that is going to last. The next ATH may very well get pushed out to 2022.
