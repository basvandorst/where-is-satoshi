Why dont you do something about it then. Ohh wait your too busy bitching an complaining. Same reason bitcoin has a hard time advancing. Because no one knows when to agree something can be good.

Well your only option as far as a increase in block size would be bcash. At this point that is not an option for myself because I do not believe in its backers. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:26:18
Get btc or ltc....preferrably both ��
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:22:35
I would say a good argument against currently being in a bubble is that the overall crypto market cap is 200 billion above where bitcoin peaked in price.

Please feel free to read those posts. They were directected against coinbase and your shitcoin

Yeah worthless currency that will have vast usecases! Lay off the led paint for christ sake.

You could always use litecoin. Its not a scam like bch. Low fees, fast, stable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:25:09
Big surprise
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:10
-roger ver behind it
- aims to replace, not help btc
- minors mining it at a loss for months
- whale money pumping unrealistic prices costing many new investors money 
I could go on and on. It is fake artificial coin. Trust me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:36:52
Are you saying you think both chains will survive? B2x included?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:08:45
Do your research. Its a fact.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:16:39
Just look it as a buying opportunity. I have a strong feeling we will see a repeat of post august 1st in the altcoin world. There are a few feel strongly will be clear winners.

Bcash just became obsolete

Shita just crazy to me. I feel like I gotta be constantly paying attention or I might take a big loss on my btc
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:25:06
Im just a newbie just asking. I thought the fork was going to introduce upgraded to the orriginal btc. So I was not sure if people felt that orriginal chain would prevail or not.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:25:53
Quality post SMH

Three easy steps:
-Get a coinbase account
-link bank account/credit card
-max out limits weekly on crypto.

Im long term in several coins. One being btc. I have also heard that one of the new coins with the split is either going to replace btc or die. I worry that if the one one takes over and I am not paying attention I could loose out of the classic btc dies. I also store offline. Don't like holding on exchanges so if new coins were issued Idk how I would even get them. Removing from storage is a hastle and I don't like moving my coins unless I have to.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:21:57
Apparently this guy hasn't. Dont get me wrong I have some bitcoin. But I never place all my bets in one basket.

So is bt1 the orriginal btc? And bt2 has the 2mb upgrade? So this fork will result in two more alts on top of bch?
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:49:53
There is both
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:30:04
The whole thing just seems like a cluster mess of confusion. I hope having 2-3 alts of btc wont dillute the image to newcomers.

Alternatives to bitcoin hence "alt" coin

Is that when the btc gold split occurs?
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:07:51
That will be funny if you're right. All this nonsense for nothing!
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:46:08
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:01:17
I was told it will be difficult for both chains to survive, unlike the bch situation. If thats truly the case won't it be a shitshow? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:58:44
All the negative comments from greedy btc holders. If it were not for charlie lee you would not be getting segwit. I personally hold both btc and ltc and have no oppion either way. I think they would work great together. But if they go their sepwrate ways its fine with me too. The greed and selfishness is revolting. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:02:16
Agreed :-)
