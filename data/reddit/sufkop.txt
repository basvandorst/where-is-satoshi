How do I receive a lightning payment?

I read on ‘the other sub’ (just to try to get multiple points of view) that routes are hardcoded, that routing doesn’t work yet, is this true?

They said: all demo wallets have hardcoded routes to well connected hubs. That its not possible to receive satoshis without a listening node. That routing is an unsolved problem and requires decentralization.
Its this comment:

Something about the hub being hardcoded. Cant seem to find the comment right now, will search some further...

Developers developers developers!

That is why we have Satoshi’s, right?

Haha, nice rant, but we were talking about a hypothetical. But still, fiat rely on mass delusion for their underlying value. And are subject to heavy erosion by inflation. There is nothing to back them.

It does not offer anonymity. Also, the "blockchain" is just a ledger/database. Multiple technologies (including blockchain) combine to make bitcoin into a world changing network of money.

BCH has a lower transaction volume (less people using it). BTC has a higher transaction volume (more people using it).

They could, but you don't care. Look at Venezuela. People get their bitcoins from somewhere else. Exchanges in this case are like napster and pirate bay, they are easily replicated and offered from a different location. Bitcoin will be valued by what people are willing to pay with/for it.

Dollars are used because they are perceived as valuable. They are not valuable, they are debt. They are backed by nothing but a delusion. If this becomes clear, fiat currencies will be nothing.
But you don't care at that point. If the government is passing these kinds of laws you have entirely different problems. It is exactly the kind of thing Bitcoin can counter.

Do you have any examples of hardware wallets getting hacked/malware?

Also, Season 1 Episode 7, minute 16:25 , speaking on the qualities of Cryptocurrencies;
"Why? Why Gencoin? How it can give third-world communities access to banking? How it can give oppressed nation the same rights we have? Yeah, sure, heard it a million times. **Bitcoin, all those others peer to peers, already died on that hill.**".
Seems like every time Bitcoin comes up in this series they try to talk it down or make it look like something insignificant.

The more they will *try* to regulate it.

In the first episode on minute 29:38 the series says:


where the inventor of the "Gencoin" from the series, defending her version, goes on to explain:


Not true. Haha they are actually taking all the things that will prevent "third party interference and ultimately corruption" and pretending it will cause these things.

I agree. It coms down to; You can not trust anyone else with (your) money. They have the tendency to run away with (or dilute) it.

Get a paper or hardware wallet. Your coins are not safe and not yours if you don’t have the keys and/or they are on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:11:59
Take them out on your on wallet now, You don’t own the keys to your bitcoin, so you don’t own your bitcoin. And they can do anything they want with it.
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:09:19
You don’t own your coins. Get your coins off the exchange. You don’t own them if you don’t own the keys. Get a paper wallet or a hardware wallet to sene them to.

Hand out fliers in the morning or just before lunch near the entrance of the Guliver office building. Lots of IT companies are located there.

On April 1st 2017 Japan passed legislation recognizing cryptocurrency as legal method of payment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:30:16
No. Get a paper or hardware wallet. Your coins are not safe and not yours if you don’t have the keys and/or they are on an exchange.
