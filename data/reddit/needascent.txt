Because they’ve already taxed the money you used to buy it 
and why even give them more when you receive zero, yet literally thousands of illegal people who do not pay into taxes receive them by being allowed to use their children’s SSN on their tax return but penalize you if you do not have enough money to afford healthcare. Because it isn’t healthcare is health insurance. Like net neutrality isn’t neutral
