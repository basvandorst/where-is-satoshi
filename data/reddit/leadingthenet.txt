He got involved in Rojava, so no, not a latte sipping anarchist.
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:59:45
Per se*
@_date: 2017-02-27 15:42:56
Finally. Someone who talks sense in this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:26:09
I'm sorry, but that's not what I and countless other people have signed up for. You can't blame us for sticking to the original vision of the project.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:20:56
Small incremental increases is exactly what BU proposes, lol.
@_date: 2017-03-09 09:46:42
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:16:48
Please be more specific, and also provide evidence, if possible.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:32:39
So how do we know it is real and not just some made up fantasy of someone's?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:22:38
You say it like it's a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:31:17
Well I wouldn't even know where to start if I were in your shoes, but that is because I think the claim is total nonsense. 
Someone made quite a serious claim, you came to their defense, the burden of proof is on you. Provide some evidence, I'll analyse it, and will then decide whether to agree or disagree with the claim.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:21:30
Your arguments are amazing, I have to say.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:23:21
Haha, jesus, you have no idea how stats work, do you?
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:56:15


Ah, so you have no evidence. Well, I was convinced that would be the case, but I hoped not. Maybe you're just perceiving malice where there is none?
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:07:06
No offence mate, but people clearly explained to you in the comments why posting that video out of context isn't right.
Now you're over here victimising yourself. I'm not sure how that helps your cause.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:59:03
Ok, so in what way is their behaviour less than ideal?
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:32:05
In what way would a divided Bitcoin be good for The PBOC?
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:38:17
Because what you wrote makes no sense whatsoever, from a maths standpoint.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:45:27
Which is?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:18:22
So? Are you forced to use bitcoin.com? Use slush then, you do have a choice.
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:13:15
Nah, I'm waiting for it to be at 700 to buy more.
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:39:59
You're right, I got a bit greedy. Will buy some ASAP.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:12:30
Because of the panic?
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:10:29
Wait, what do you mean "support"?
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:36:22
So where's the alternative? I'm a newb, so genuinely asking.
@_date: 2016-11-14 17:33:31
The fact that it's missing the iPhone 6S/6S+ seems fishy.
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:53:26
Thank you.
