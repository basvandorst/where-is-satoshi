IMO, the user experience has been fine for a while with Mycelium, breadwallet, you name it. I've bought several things online, donated, tipped, used atms, and even integrated bitcoin payments into my own art website. The experience is great, that is IF you already have and are familiar with bitcoin, if your already "in".
With my 5 year courtship with bitcoin, many of my friends are bitcoin curious, discuss it with me often, and want to get into it, yet after 5 years no one has taken that first step. Sometimes they want me to manage their bitcoin for them, which I won't do for reasons obvious to us. It's just silly.
The bottle neck of GETTING and UNDERSTANDING bitcoin absolutely fails the user experience test for most people. Sure, I find services like circle or coinbase stunningly simple because of my familiarity with bitcoin. Regular people don't see it that way. Some friends don't even have bank accounts. One friend tried to get bitcoin and found himself downloading bitcoinqt and the entire blockchain, gave up after an hour. Never tried again. Another got the circle app and asked in utter confusion "wait I have to buy money?" 
In the past I would give away a dollar or five of bitcoin to friends, they'd install a wallet, get it and be amazed with how fast it was too get "digital cash". I'd tell them to go buy something, send them some links. No one spent it. I'd spy on the blockchain to see if they ever moved it into another address or spent it. Out of 10 people, 1 transferred theirs into another wallet in the last 3 years.
The learning curve and initial gated entry to bitcoin is still an abysmal experience for the common potential user.

Instead of signing a transaction, most wallets allow you to sign/verify a message too. Anyone can then verify the message was signed by the key associated with that address

Make a budget for yourself, really stick to it, set a small reasonable portion you can afford aside for bitcoin and savings. Don't trade it, don't gamble on alts. I started with 50 dollars in 2011. My $15 coins dipped in value to $4 per. It sucked. I didn't know better, I had no sight on the future, and like you had very little $$ to spare. Yet you do seem to have your sights on the future.
Dollar cost averaging in with a budget is a powerful emotionless way of investing into something you see a future in. price goes up you have profit, price goes down for a while you get to buy coins on sale. If I actually had a budget, a vision for the future, and plan in 2011, I could've dollar cost averaged in and accumulated something like 180 coins that first year alone just by putting in $20 bucks a week.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:43:06
Let's put it this way, the strong fears people have about these recent dips I used to feel over ten dollar moves. It shows me how shortsighted one can become when focused so narrowly in the price. With much promise just on the horizon (lightning etc) and the greater public awareness in crypto generally, the future looks promising. I keep in mind that in 5 or 10 years I will look back to today and thank myself for not being so shortsighted as I once was.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:12:53
I disagree that you understand the basics, else you wouldn't be asking this question. It's ok tho, this is how we learn. 
First, there are no coins. Only inputs and outputs associated with an address on the blockchain. Everyone with a node has a copy. That information is valueless because everyone has it and can copy it at their leisure. 
The value is in being able to create outputs from one address to another, and that requires the correct private key. This is what is inside a wallet, inside your ledger, the private key. (In actuality many private keys)
If coins are "dead" or whatever you mean, that means the private key is lost or was never known (like a burner address). The private key is really just a giant number, impossible to guess. If it's gone, it's gone. Any balance associated with that key can never be used again. That balance is rendered valueless. 
What you seem to be suggesting is a little strange. An analogy would be a keychain without any keys, or an empty box that says "gold inside", or a blank txt file titled "bitcoin wallet.txt"

In 2010, 2011 I was running distributed computing with BOINC for curiosity and fun, things like seti and climate models. A friend posted an article about the silk road and bitcoin was mentioned. It stood out to me far more then the sensationalist drug story. I think I intuitively understood the distributed nature of bitcoin because of BOINC, so I downloaded the client and immediately started mining. I thought I was late to the game but went through all the hoops and bought 3 coins at $15 a piece anyway. It's weird to think I was mining 0.02 coins a day. I knew nothing about private keys, markets, a total noob. The price collapsed to $4 per coin, so I walked away, my coins quietly hibernating on gox for 2 years...
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:43:31
Post the transaction so someone can see if it was theirs. You don't want to send back because there's always the possibility they don't have access to that address' private key anymore and you'd be sending coins into the void. But also then anyone could claim it as their mistake. 
You're basically out of decent options until someone signs a message using the sending address to prove it's their coins and their mistake. Enjoy the donation.

It's intentionally difficult so noobs don't accidentally get them. Different wallets have different methods, but in bitcoin core it's in the command line you can export the keys I believe. 
Most wallets these days use a seed phrase which is used to derive a chain of keys, (it used to be random and caused people to lose coins) so with those seed words any wallet can derive them.  
I usually only see private keys when making paper wallets aka my own private/public key pairs using something like vanitygen

Never share your private key. That IS your coins for all intents and purposes. Your bitcoin addresses are public, it's how you can send bitcoin to a specific person, or how people can send coins to you. They are searchable in the blockchain.

I had planed on buying monthly in 2011-2012 with my leftover budget of $100 or so, but family/friend peer pressure made me feel foolish. I opened a savings account instead. Coins were going for as low as $4 then, and everything about bitcoins future was absolute uncertainty. It was so dead I stopped paying attention for over a year. But all the while people were working on it, building it, using it. I would've accumulated close to 400 coins had I gone with my instinct.
The fundamentals are strong in 2018, and take it from me, people who have not taken the time to learn or even use bitcoin have no idea what they're talking about. Seriously even if we dump to 3k or something... don't sweat it. The underlying tide of bitcoin and it's users is stronger than ever. These 2018 dumps are dumps for ants. Like riding the kiddie rollercoaster.  
Another way of looking at it, you're buying millibitcoins these days. The decimal place is completely arbitrary. 1 mBTC is worth about $6... that's what full coins were going for in 2012. in 2025 I think we'll be buying microBitcoins for $6 as lightning network grows and frees up the satoshi as a useful unit of currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:30:04
Stocks are indivisible. As price goes up there are less buyers that can afford them. This is not true with bitcoin, yet. The fundamental unit of bitcoin in the protocol is the satoshi, 0.00000001 BTC. That decimal is literally arbitrary and for display only, thus the price is arbitrarily scaled. In terms of the fundamental unit of bitcoin, people are actually buying large amounts of satoshis, 10,000,000 satoshis for $16,000 today. In terms of the satoshi, the price is 0.016 cents USD. Considering the future of the lightning network, streaming money, and micro transactions, bitcoin is massively undervalued by a few orders of magnitude.

I think people acquainted with bitcoin should start thinking of it in those terms, but it will only confuse the public and the noob. Let people go on believing it costs too much. One reward for learning is the chance to accumulate. Once upon a time I thought 2 dollar bitcoins were too expensive because miners got 50 at a time... The psychology of numbers and scale is a tricky thing to reconcile.

@_date: 2018-09-03 16:42:25
Just another foothill. If you cherrypick January as your starting point all you see is down. That's a form of selection bias. Consider the whole timeline if you want to think about price. Bitcoin regularly goes through media hype cycles every couple of years, booms and then consolidates in price, then slowly paces onward. I've personally seen 3 of these cycles since 2011. Part of what fuels them is the halving of mining payouts every ~4 years which tightens supply. Demand then overreacts with hype. 
When you look at other metrics beyond price, like network growth, lightning network growth, media attitudes, global regulatory adoption, it's consistently advancing. Bitcoin isn't some company you "invest" in that potentially goes belly up or potentially does well. It's a technology following the same adoption curve as radio, television, or the internet.

I've dealt with some extremely smart critics over the years.  These are programmers and technical people,  regularly attending defcon. Even going as far as 'hacking' the ridiculous bitfi hardware.  And yet they don't even know about paper wallets, or HD wallets. They've never considered the power and access bitcoin offers to the swaths of unbanked around the world.  I don't know what it is, pride or something,  but it's an active willful ignorance. They've chosen a side and don't care to learn. They bring up tulips.
On the other hand I've seen many skeptics actually learn and use bitcoin have this moment of enlightenment. 
I personally never had a moment of enlightenment, I understood the ramifications of bitcoin almost instantly in 2011 having come from a background of BOINC distributed computing and torrent transfers. I also had a historical curiosity about money, how it changed in time, mostly from watching back to the future endlessly as a kid.
I think there's a few key concepts people need to understand,  and when you collect em all you just get it, like a lightning bolt.

No.  Anything including the overly trusted coinbase can be compromised potentially be it by hackers,  governments,  or company policy. Bitcoin is about autonomy, removing third parties. If you're uncomfortable or uncertain about how to take control of your own coins play around with testnet coins. Learn the ropes. I've seen several events in 7 years of bitcoin to underscore the fact you need to take control of your coins. The confidence comes with practice.

Only 2 friends were diligent enough to recover their coins.

This is gentlemen. Or 15x gentlemen, really. There was a rally that marked the end of the 2014 bear market and it peaked around 400ish. We called it the gentleman rally because someone typoed "This is gentleman" forgetting the "it".  I look back in awe at how distraught that bear market made me, made all of us, and how much the gentleman rally ignited our bitcoin spirits again. It reminded me that we're all in this together, we all have our part to play.
We'll see those good times again. And these times are pretty fine from some points of view. I genuinely hope in a couple of years y'all can share with me the same tranquil perspective looking upon the capitulating noobs of the 2022 rally as I have this week, this month, this season... 
Stop trying to trade. Bitcoin is personal money, make it yours, make it work for you, take these months to dollar cost average in, to build something, start a node, make a lightning channel, start a website, learn to code. 
You're important! Do stop letting a chart toss you around.

My two satoshis: Quite simply, if you find a brain wallet collision, it's due to someone's negligence. it's as if someone left their cash wallet sitting out in public and you came across it. You have the choice to give it back to the owner, or at least attempt to do so, or take ownership.
 Finding out who owns a bitcoin address may be difficult but you could post on Reddit "who owns address X " and sign a message. Maybe even move their coins to catch their attention. The original owner can respond by signing a message as well. Maybe you return it all, or maybe you agree on a fee for providing them the "service" of  saving their coins from their own negligence. I believe this actually played out once or twice on Reddit over the years I've been lurking here. 
The point is, if people create wallet seeds or brain wallets with enough entropy, you'll never have this scenario. Only out of negligence will someone's wallet be simple enough to find.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:35:39

Well I used 'wallet' because as a wallet might have an ID in it, through cryptographic signing someone can prove they control the address and thus own it. There's an identity associated with wallets.
Here's another analogy to think through. Seeds and private keys aren't quite calculated, they are 'found' within a huge number space. If I were to sit at a piano, the odds of me building a Beethoven piece from scratch are functionally impossible. To find moonlight sonata within the possible potential of all notes and timing, I'd have to come up with some arrangement of notes, check it against known music, try again, check, try again check... It would take an eternity. And in the end im referencing known music to see if I match.
I'm much more likely to stumble across "happy birthday" or "twinkle twinkle little star" than Beethoven because of their relative simplicity.
Similarly, you'd have to expend a massive amount of time and energy to find a proper bitcoin seed. That work, and referencing the pre-existing blockchain to see if there are coins associated with it is a clear act of knowingly stealing ownership of something. 
Have you ever created vanity addresses? There's software out there that searches the wallet space to come up with an address that says something. For example I can make an address that starts as 1mabezard..... (well maybe if all those characters are allowed). It would take a lot of computing power, because the only way to find that address is to randomly generate millions upon millions of key pairs and match them against a pattern until you find one. The more complex the pattern, the more energy and time you have to expend. Finding 1ma....... Is easy, takes seconds. Finding a whole known address is functionally impossible because the universe might be over by then lol.
So that's what I'm trying to convey, careless bitcoin seeds, the negligence of using 4 words as A seed or brain wallet, is practically begging to be stolen. A seed of 12 words is by far way more complex and difficult to find requiring enormous amounts of time and energy. 24 words is ONLY going to be found by, what shall we call it, plagiarism. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:05:40
Bitcoin HD wallet seeds are a list of words. Most likely they used 12 or 24 of these words in a specific order to derive a wallet. They may have added an extra word as well.

A: If all you see is the public key you could forge 10,000\+ notes with the same public key, everyone would verify their new cardcoin \(or whatever they're calling this\) on the same address.
B: If you have access to the private key, hey just copy it, give the note to the next guy and sweep the copied private key into your other wallet.
C: If you can somehow spend the card's balance without access to the private key that means some centralized service has your keys and potentially is doing A or B above.
stay away.
If you want a physical storage for your coins, get a hardware wallet or generate and write down your own HD word seed, or create your own cold storage private keys using [bitaddress.org]( or similar.

If it starts with a 1 it is likely your public address, you can look that up on a block explorer to see the balance. 
If it starts with 5 that is the private key, don't share that with anyone. That number allows you to control any coins it might have associated with it. 
Private keys can be "swept" or imported by various wallets to gain access to your coins.
If you have a password you likely encrypted your wallet with it using whatever wallet you had.

I bought at $15 dollars and watched it plummet and die at $2, flatline for over a year. It was stressful and miserable, I felt like I was an idiot. I know exactly how you feel. I stopped paying attention to bitcoin and walked away for 2 years! until 2013 when I found my coins that had lost over 80% of their value were up by 1,200% and climbing. We had a huge unbelievable rollercoaster up to $1,100 and down to $200.
I've seen 3 of these major booms and busts. It's slow and painful at times. 
Have patience. When you plant a tree it takes years to grow and bring fruit. Bitcoin IS a new thing, a new asset, a little sapling. the future is still remarkably big. It's volatile, and deflationary in the long run. Use this time to learn to code, build something, learn the lightning network. I'm dollar cost averaging in every week. Stop looking at red candles!

over the summer there has been speculation about an entity or entities driving the price down with large market sells. I personally have seen many of the sells happen live. It's become a bit of mythology and we have dubbed them "the Bearwhale".
Then over the weekend a gigantic sell order appeared on the bitstamp order book of around 30k bitcoins causing panic and mayhem at first. Eventually the sell wall was placed at $300, and it seems all traders decided to not panic for once and bought the sell in it's entirety. If you look at the bitstamp charts you will see a flat line in price for a few hours. this was the event. And thus the legend goes, however true or untrue, that we "slayed" the bearwhale.

No. Every noob that makes a Coinbase account sees bitcoin cash presented as equal and legitimized. If it wasn't being actively supported like that, you'd be right. However, the opposite is true, BCH is being sold and promoted to noobs, people coming into crypto unsure of up from down, people easy to con. Jokes and serious rhetoric against BCH are needed to help educate people so they don't end up on the wrong chain, or accidentally send their new coins to the wrong type of address...
The block size debate is years and years of civil war around here. It's not just going to go 'poof' if we stay quiet about it.

Assuming you have a wallet like electrum our mycellium etc, you simply choose the option to "restore a wallet from seed" or whatever it says. Then you enter the words. These are very basic bitcoin questions, like asking how to put gas in your car. I suggest you brush up on bitcoin wallets first. Play with valueless testnet coins, it's how I learned 7 years ago!

We all have stories like that I'm sure. The important thing to know is you are not alone. With such a specialized cutting edge idea as bitcoin, it is inevitable that you find yourself surrounded by those who neither understand nor share the enthusiasm.
When I first discovered Bitcoin in 2011, my mind was blown! It was like seeing the inevitable future emerge. I managed to buy 3 at around $16, did a little mining... And of course I told all of my friends about it with long conversations like all of us here must have gone through. You know, where you are all excited and their eyes gloss over (the same looks I got when talking about Issac Asimov books I was reading at the time). 
When trusted friends and family downplayed bitcoin as silly, and as the price slowly evaporated that summer, I felt a little humiliated, a little stupid that I had blown $50, and I stopped learning about bitcoin, accepting that my friend's ignorance on the idea had some relevance over my ignorance. I never learned enough about bitcoin to see that they were very wrong about it all.
Then in 2013 when bitcoin splashed into the media on the April rise, I realized I still had my bitcoins and dived wholly into it all again. I was completely stunned and grateful that members of the community kept at it, and I was very remorseful that I had let uninformed negative opinions sway me away for 2 years. I learned there were others just like me, who understand the potential.
This winter, with all the news, people are now coming to me in person, on fb, asking me all about how it works. I had perhaps 2 dozen friends get wallets, and I sent them a few dollars worth of bitcoin each.
With more knowledge about bitcoin I again talked to many of the same friends who once turned me away form bitcoin. One or two began to see some relevance because I probably educated them better this time. But they often come back with all the same myths and detractive ideas about backing, alt coin take overs, hackers making coins. But this time I was armed with educated information on the subject, and thus far more confident. Friends and family who know you will recognize that confidence and realize you actually know what you are talking about after a while. 
And this is where you seem to be at. Keep learning, answer questions when people ask. Perhaps even innovate if you have ideas! Contribute. Buy things with bitcoin where you can. Describe bitcoin when the conversation permits, but don't preach! Other people are your students, each at varying levels of understanding, and you are their teacher. Patience is key when you teach. And remember, there will always be people who just don't want to take the class... just yet.

So I'm sure we can agree astrology is BS. But imagine if 90% of people believed in astrology and acted upon retrogrades in predictable ways, like buying all the bread in a store during a retrograde. Knowing this you can use astrology to buy bread before the rest of the people clean the shelves.
There's no reason fib levels should work, but people consistently do trade off them and pick them as levels to act.
Even tho the genesis of a system is arbitrary, the behaviors of people consistently make them into self fulfilling prophecy. It's important to remember price charts are graphs of human behavior.

First of all, amazing to use!
But something that may be an issue/confusing:
1. I created a HD account called "Account 1" and played around with some testnet coins transferred between it and the default private key generated when first opening the app. 
2. I made a backup pdf of the master seed.
3. I then made a new HD "Account 2" sent all coins to its address
4. deleted/reinstalled the app
5. I imported the backup seed from the pdf, however only "Account 1" appears. "Account 2" holding all the coins, I genuinely thought it was lost.
6. This was not obvious, but when adding a second HD account to the imported backup and calling it "new account 2" it now showed my old "Account 2" with the coins I thought were lost. Obviously because the accounts are generated from the HD seed.
Having to recreate the second HD account manually was unexpected and unintuitive. I happened to find out it worked by accident. It seems this would be an issue if for some who may have many HD accounts. When restoring from a backup, perhaps the wallet could automatically discover any accounts with a balance?
@_date: 2014-09-05 20:44:17
maybe for now, even just a message informing users that accounts need to be recreated after an import would be enough.

I completely agree. Gum bichromate printing is even a niche among photographers and artists! I've long been drawn to it for the old look and the hands on feel of making an image, and yet at the same time I enjoy the technical aspects of it all. The blend of old tech and new tech.
I do work in many other forms of art, including digital arts, and have long considered making pieces that "crossover" into our little bitcoin world here. But the difficult part as an artist is balancing the act of marketing to a group in a sales kind of way (like making t-shirts), or making art for its own sake in a way that will attract a market receptive to it... But it's something I'm exploring.
I saw that guy's metal pieces. Very neat and intricate things.

Afaik every transaction output is required to equal the sum of its inputs. In other words there are always 2 outputs to a transaction,  the amount sent and the change output. Years ago the change was sent right back to the address that sent it, or sometimes a random address. I believe Bitcoin core (before it was called core) generated 100 change addresses. This was a weakness in privacy. And also, sometimes users would fail to backup the correct change addresses and loose their coins forever. 
You also must remember wallets are collections of addresses. Since HD wallets became widespread, the structure changed from a collection of random privkey pubkey pairs to a chain of addresses derived from a seed. Now change is sent to a previously unused address in a wallet.

Only it has been used for half a decade by many of us with Bitcoin. Milli is just a basic SI metric system unit used all over the globe meaning 1/1000 of something. It literally already is standard as part of the metric system. I don't see any use in fighting an accepted global nomenclature like it's not a thing, strange hill to fight on. Gradeschool children all over the planet understand this. 
Regardless, it is all arbitrary, in the code is satoshis. This topic has gone on for at least 6 years with no consensus around much other that calling microBTC "bits" which is damn confusing IMO. I'm running a lightning node and have become more adapted to thinking in sats this year. I find the mBTC still a very useful way of thinking about it without having to count my zeros everytime.
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:07:08
All I can say is bitcoin doesn't exist like that, it's only numbers, only inputs for every transaction. 
I suppose if you mined a block directly you could have mint coins where the inputs ARE the block reward. But you're 8 years to late for that. Miners for the last several years use pool mining where the block reward is divided among several miners. I used to pool mine in 2011, and considered those partial coins I mined "fresher" than, say buying from someone else. in effect the trail of inputs back to the block reward was very short. I actually kept them separate for several years, kind of proud I had mined them.

You've used millimeters right? Similarly, micrometers are common for scientists that use them. I've used mBTC for 6 years now and it's nothing complicated. I can say $11k and you know what that means intuitively. 1 mBTC is worth $11. Once you use it, it becomes second nature.

@_date: 2019-10-18 12:49:46
Ive written about my experience before on here. I had the same experiences as you in 2011 and listened. I watched price slump on me slowly and painfully from $18 to $4. I felt like a fool, like I'd given a lot of money to a Nigerian prince. And family and friends made me feel it. Instead of putting money into bitcoin or into building a gpu mining rig, both very real plans I had mapped out, I listened to them and opened my first savings account instead. I walked away from bitcoin for 2 years, my coins sat on Gox. I only have a few coins from then, but doing the painful math years later I found I could've had over 400 coins had I trusted myself and my knowledge about distributed computing over the vagueness of their criticism. It was only a few grand at that time.
It's very rare that you get a leg up on the future. Many people never get the opportunity. When it's in front of you it is hard to see, it's a risk. I actually spent many coins, and made some artwork for coins. There were those of us who used bitcoin and no doubt in my mind forged its foundation as a real thriving network. In 2013 I stopped listening to critics unless they could explain how bitcoin worked. No one ever could,  most never heard of a hash function even, yet they felt completely confident in telling me it was a scam or would get hacked. 2016 I stopped the trading game and started hodling and DCA. 
In the 2017 bullrun, my 4th ride on that coaster,  bitcoin went far more mainstream than it had ever been. I'd run into altcoin boys everywhere. They treated me like some old wizard nostradamus bitcoin dragon, hodling my coins. Truth is that insight wasn't magic, it was years of patience, setbacks, learning, reading, using, and educating.   
"Why did you buy?" turned into "how do you buy?" or "Why didn't you sell?" from family and friends when we were at $19k. 
These days I barely look at the charts. I've been able to change/save some friends lives with the finacial power bitcoin has afforded. It's hard to believe it has almost been a decade of this. I look ahead to the next decade and run a lightning node, ushering in the age of the satoshi.

lemme ask you this, if I sent you 10 dollars via paypal, does it matter to you that i deposited 10,000 pennies or 40 quarters to my account? No it doesn't 10 dollars is just a number, a total.  
you buy 1 bitcoin you have 1 bitcoin.  
In a simplified explanation of how bitcoin works, there are no "coins" only inputs you receive from others at an address, and outputs you can control with that address's private key. If you can spend a total of 1 bitcoin then you have 1 bitcoin.

I haven't seen you lurking around in a while!
True statement. Every system of value is technically a ponzi or whatever, requiring a future of demand. A system of value only works if we believe it will have value in the future as a kind of collective delusion. This is true about pieces of paper with a number on it, banks that have your name on a list next to a number. Hell, even water is just some molecules, but we know it is required for survival so we foster a belief that it has value for us in the future and try not to pour poison in it (most of the time) because ourselves and others will value it in the future.

Some of us were around and have that old price chart memorized. I even associate some candles with life events and certain memories lol. I saw this time traveler's post the day it was posted. 
The mere fact that the "time traveler" said btc would be 10,000 at all seemed pretty crazy. I interpret it as the price will have crossed $X by each date. It would be crazy to hit 100,000 in the next 2.5 months, yet I've seen that kind of thing happen around here.

It's absolutely a factor, but you'll never see it in the noise and volatility of btc. If you were going to simulate bitcoin price tho, inflation would be a variable. In the US our wages have been mostly stagnant for over a decade while the costs of almost everything has gone up, or usually more descretley the oz of things like packaged foods have gotten smaller. The only thing immune to inflation seems to be jack in the box tacos...

Simply,  no. You can only spot dips in hindsight. I've caught a few with limit orders back in the day with great luck. One of the most profitable dips I caught was at $180 but it was not entirely clear that was the last of the dips to come until months later when we re-tested that level. 
You also need to constantly monitor the charts,  evaluate conditions. And even then you have to be in the right position with funds ready to go when snatching that dip. That's a tremendous cost of time and attention which many people don't take into account.
And even after all that there's high risk,  the exchange you use gets hacked and you lose those profits anyway. 
A simple automated DCA strategy in every phase of the past 8 years I've been involved would've rendered unimaginably greater profits and results than trying to compete with the bots. I realized this in 2016 and never looked back.

I suggest this to new users often, play with testnet.
 If you are unaware,  there's a valueless version of bitcoin called 'testnet' for developers and learning. It functions exactly the same as real bitcoin or as we call it 'main net'. You can download testnet versions of wallets, go to websites called faucets that give you testnet coins. Use testnet to send transactions,  make testnet paper wallets,  backup and restore testnet seeds and keys. 
I'm a bitcoin veteran from 2011 and still use testnet to understand my way around the lightning network without losing anything.

We all had this discussion a few years ago till people's eyes bled. Bits is a confusing term because it already has other meaning. For example, I just saw someone on another post saying "I bought a bit of a bitcoin." It could also mean computer bits. It sounds to similar to bitcoin, so that it may be confused with slang. To new users this is an ambiguous confusing term. But alas, no one is going to go around saying microbitcoins. We're kind of stuck with 'bits', unfortunately.

the whole "taxes are theft" thing is woefully ignorant. But you're not an uncle on fb so I'll leave it at that.  
Also, conservatives tend to invoke their interpretation of the founding fathers, a sort of imaginary deified version of them (think paintings of Jesus leaning over them in the continental congress), not who they were or what their intentions were as captured in their actions and writings.  
I'm liberal AF and have been involved with bitcoin since 2011. One of the constant detractions from skeptics that I run into in the wild are people thinking bitcoin is libertarian, owned by Ron Paul's army of milk pasteurization deregulators. Paul Krugman for example, a liberal dude, politicizes bitcoin and criticizes it for political ideas he attributes to it. Usually their argument is libertarianism is rather foolish (I agree), but then they think Bitcoin is libertarian, and transitive property&gt;therefore bitcoin is foolish.  
but no, bitcoin is apolitical, permissionless, decentralized, unaffiliated. It is what we make of it. It's a tool. It can be a tool for libertarian ideals, or a tool for socialized ideals.

As another who's been around since 2011, those early coins were spent and tipped when they were in what was at the time massive profits. Our actual usage of bitcoin enabled it to grow.

More! I think you had a wallet on blockchain.info! I never had one myself but it was once very popular. I saw your edit on main post just now and will say some things:


this is most likley your blockchain.info login information 


this as we determined is likely your private key, and I guess it has been encrypted with your password which is why electrum didn't import nor recognize it.


i have never seen a private key with dashes, must be blockchain.ifo's wallet format, we're still onto something.


this is your public address (starts with 1) the very first thing i would do is search it on blockchain.info or any other block explorer to see how many coins are in it. It is public so if you're willing you can share that address here with no consequence other than letting us all see how many coins you have.

so I've been around since 2011 and have never heard of a "proof of keys" event until the last few weeks. This has not been an ongoing tradition, save maybe a handful of people. Google trends confirms the term has only gained significant popularity within December [  
The idea is claimed to have originated 25 days ago by "sotashi" to mark the 10 year anniversary as the start of a NEW tradition.
This is not to disparage the idea. I'm a huge advocate for taking control of your own keys. This time in the onset of 2014 we were practically screaming at people to get off Gox but a big premium in price kept the greedy trapped. The idea that this has been an ongoing "tradition" is really weird and to the limits of my knowledge and research into it, false.

the "no inputs found" is exactly what you think it means, no coins were ever sent to that test address because it never existed before. Sweeping means sending coins from one key to your current wallet, so electrum is trying to move your coins from that private key to a new one, your new electrum wallet...
i'm in this with you now, let's keep trying!  
PS: as you see the old way of backing up wallets was a headache, that's why the world switched to the word seeds and HD wallets as standard.

@_date: 2018-02-15 08:45:25
Modern wallets use HD seeds to generate addresses (12 or 24 words). They didn't exist in 2012 as far as I know. You may have the raw private key which is how we used to do it. If it starts with a 5 it likely is a private key.  Many wallets allow you to import single private keys (if that is what you have)
I think we need more information to accurately help you, (eg is this on paper, a computer file?) but never reveal the exact numbers/characters that you have in hand.

Don't forget the fundamentals. There's a lot of "boy who cried wolf" and "past doesn't predict future" etc in these comments... People involved with bitcoin know these things. Our judgments and willingness to participate are not solely based in price action alone. The constant resilience of the bitcoin protocol, and its ongoing developments are also heavy factors as why these corrections are never the death of bitcoin, and also why this January 2018 correction will be another footnote in bitcoin's history. Beneath all the price action attention, something new and strong has been steadily growing.

Looking at market cap like that doesn't make sense. There could be 5 people with 1 btc in the world that won't sell below 200 billion. Price is determined by agreement of the market; the last price sold/bought. Market cap is not a sum of all value put in. You don't need 1 trillion dollars to fill a market cap reservoir. You just need the agreement among buyers and sellers that X is the price. 
Also consider the arbitrary decimal place. Most new buyers are dropping like $100 or less. They're buying 0.001 bitcoins today. Normalize that to the satoshi and you find the fundamental unit of btc is a fraction of a cent. As the lightning network grows, mBTC, uBTC, and satoshis will be used and will grow in value because retail buyers will be buying smaller and smaller portions of "a bitcoin".

Yea I came down a bit on you, the only conversions I've had about bitcoin have been with skeptics lately, skeptics that don't know anything about it. I'm conditioned to explain and missed the point of your comment. Where are the people going to come from? They're out there. I told my eager to buy friends to wait for the dip back in December's mania. Still one managed to buy the exact top.... The same people who didn't buy in 2013 are talking about throwing thousands of dollars in when there's hype (fortunately I curtailed them). Here in the dip they're afraid again. But they're actually curious now, watching, learning. I personally went through this process, it took me 2 years from 2011 to 2013. Every bull run brings people and awareness. I think we've got a little sideways ahead, and then the slow rally will creep on again.

Your private key IS your coins! (if it has any coins) keep that number safe. the wallet.dat file is from the original bitcoin core, if you don't have that you might not need it.  
Let's see if you can get it in a wallet that can use it. Now to make life easier almost everything is done via QR codes these days, and even myself I am having a difficult time importing a test private key that you just type in. What I would do is go to  , save the website to your computer, and run it offline. You can use that website to generate new private keys to play with and learn from first. after it generates an address you will use to test and learn from, type it (or copy paste) into the 'wallet details' page and it will give you all kinds of formats and QR codes of your test address.  
Download a wallet such as electrum, mycellium, breadwallet, etc. After setting them up (it will probably give you 12 random words to save) search the menus for importing private keys or sometimes they call is a 'Single Address Account'. I use mycellium for spending coins personally. in mycellium there's a key icon with a plus sign, tap that. at the bottom is 'advanced' and it will bring you to an option to scan the QR code you generated on bitaddress.org.
when you're comfortable with the process, hold your breath, and try it on your real private key. 
good luck!

I too had skin in the game. Some insight: You had to through a bunch of intermediaries, shady seeming ones, all taking their cut just to get money on gox. I had started to move $100 myself but cut that down about halfway down the line. I barely understood bitcoin, trusted it's security at least, but the hoops to jump through to get it I most definitely did not trust. While coins were less than 10 bucks, it made little to no sense connecting banks, giving your identity, and wiring small amounts of money to the unstable infamous onramps, the same ones silk road drug users were going through. I think it took like a week or two but eventually I got 3-4 coins. I could've gotten around 20 coins had I moved the full 100 bucks. It was not a risk I was willing to take. The price was low because demand at market was low, artificially restricted by difficult access.
Now anyone can click a few times, set up new accounts, and have easy access to buying bitcoin. Demand at market is up so price is up. In the future when it's even easier to get coins (like maybe your personal bank starts offering crypto accounts our lightning channels, who knows) we'll see even more ease of access and even more demand, resulting in further price increases.

Bitaddress.org has been around for a very long time as THE paper wallet tool. You're supposed to make an offline copy, verify it's signature and such. I've used it since 2013 at least, but I'd never discourage the acquisition of a trezor in terms of security. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:03:28
If you don't hold the private keys you don't have any bitcoin, just an IOU from coinbase or local bitcoins or wherever. I'm assuming you haven't been around a while but many of us old timers learned the hard way from the GOX and Bitfinex hacks. You can be 100% secure on your end, but if the service you use gets hacked, or decides that they're going to give a 'haircut' to everyone, you're SOL. The safest storage while remaining usable and convenient is something like a hardware wallet. If you're about long term storage, absolutely consider one. If you're REALLY crazed about security and looking to hodl for like a decade, carefully created paper wallets or backups of wallet seeds.

Bitaddress.org is not unknown, the code is on github, and it's been around a very long time. Before trezor existed I used it for paper wallets to hold mined coins. It's also a great learning tool.
You're supposed to use a verified offline copy.

@_date: 2018-04-19 11:15:21
Sounds as if they treat it like every bitcoin user has 1 address. With HD wallets you actually have an endless chain of addresses. So a real users wallet will likely contain several addresses. If I send a friend bitcoin for a beer, some goes to the friend's new address, some goes to a new change address of mine. To the outside observer you cannot tell which is which, you've got a 50% chance at being right. After a few real case uses like this the chain of who's coins are who's becomes more and more uncertain. The address tagged with my data is likely to never be used again.

I spent 2-years thinking we'd never see above 1k again, thinking it was all gox induced mania. This latest crypto peak confirmed to me bitcoin is here to stay and grow.

Don't know why they're down voting you there is a default minimum transaction value of 5460 satoshis in mining software to mitigate spam transactions. It was optional, but widely adopted. Or at least that's how it used to be years ago when I mined, maybe this has changed?

I think it's important to make it clear bitcoin cash is not bitcoin. Noobs coming to the space see it as "cheap bitcoin" when they make a Coinbase account. Noobs send their coins erroneously to bch addresses. Noobs type bitcoin.com and get conned. I was asked by several people in December about buying Bch. Bch is being aggressive in asserting itself. Pretending like it doesn't exist and is not a problem masquerading as bitcoin lets Ver and his minions fester. I believe continued criticism of it here, through rhetoric or ridicule is absolutely necessary.

This comic is 100% accurate. I'd been telling friends since 2011, I even gave away what would be thousands of dollars now in bitcoin so they could use it (like $5 at the time), but they forgot to back up wallets when they got a new phone, or saved a link to blockchain info and not an actual backup... Only one friend actually kept his. I learned how simple minded and careless people can be. Not a single one decided to buy any bitcoin on their own until December of 2017... social pressure and herd mentality is a weird beast.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:09:43
Important to realize your coins are not in your phone,  they exist in the blockchain. Your wallet is really a collection of keys that let you move certain coins you own. Your seed words aren't just a backup, it is where your keys are derived from. Seed words are an attempt to standardize the creation of keys in wallets for exactly the concerns you raise. There a many wallets that allow you to enter those seed words and derive your keys, and afaik most use the same standardized implementation.

@_date: 2019-05-07 14:21:00
You started with the highest price,  any time frame since then will look down. Bitcoin is not just about making sick gains bro. Some people buy it, utilze it, and that's that.  It had value for whatever purpose they had. I've been using bitcoin since 2011. People used to cherry pick the $30 ath, the $200 ath the $1300 ath and make the same arguments you're making.
Fact is there's a deflationary global asset that is useful. There are,  believe it or not,  many people who have no idea what it is beyond name recognition. And every wave that happens more people hear about it, and more people start using it. Demand is increasing still. 
Bitcoin's utility is also increasing, the lightning network opened up the possibility of sending and utilizing single satoshis. While some of y'all have focused soley on price as an indicator,  txns are up, infrastructure is being built,  bitcoin grows in many more metrics than price alone. Price lags behind its utility and its network. 
Not trying to be hard on you, but you flashed in as a know it all expert that clearly doesn't have all the information. 2018 and 2019 have been great years in building bitcoin's infrastructure while the price settles back to its baseline trend.

No it's not. I ran a node in 2011-2013. I tried unsuccessfully to run a node in the last 24 months 3 times to set up a lightning node, the process of downloading the blockchain killed 2 hard drives and the 3rd time took a month to download even 60% of it due to repeated endless crashes of core and reindexing. I'm all for running a node but it's not "easy" yet by any stretch of the imagination.

Lol unbelievable. I suggest you take a look at the charts before boasting such bravado.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:35:26
I disagree. That's a very specific case you outline about choosing to put extra money into bitcoin or spend on coffee, the 46 vs 50. But there's a third scenario you omit where the extra value in your budget exists in the form of bitcoin itself.
I am one of those who spent coins and looks back like, dang I feel for you 10,000 coin pizza guy. I was spending the gains, effectively spending income from bitcoin. I was making sales in bitcoin, mining bitcoin. I spent 4 bitcoin on something once because they had grown to ~$200 which once upon a time was massive, almost unbelievable in terms of gains. The idea in your argument is ultimately equivalent to to 'replacing the coins you spend' so you wont miss out, but in my scenario there is no extra cash lying around to replace the coins, there's no person A person B choice being made between cash or bitcoin. There's only the bitcoin, which is why they were spent in the first place.
I could have not bought the thing, and had 4x2800 = ~$11,000 more worth of bitcoin today. This is a very real kick yourself in the butt situation for some of us, not a hypothetical "dang if I bought at $1 I'd be a billionaire" line of thinking.
But as to your second point, participating in the bitcoin economy: absolutely true! And what I tell myself at night to feel better about those missed phantom gains... In some way those phantom gains karma their way around, because if none of us had participated in the actual use of bitcoin, if none of us had spent our cheap coinz, we may very well have had $2 coins forever and no future to this grand experiment.
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:26:31
Shutting down isn't the only danger.  
They can very easily just decide you won't have access to your coins if you end up on a naughty list. The point of bitcoin is to remove trust and 3rd parties from money. Also those of us around for the past decade of bitcoin have experienced many custodial coin businesses getting hacked. It happens, even a big boy like coinbase is susceptible. They exist as targets for hackers, inside jobs, etc.  
it's an old saying around here, if you don't hold your private keys, it's not your bitcoin.

I had the same intuitive insight about bitcoin in 2011 and bought some as immediately as one could back then. I also started mining, playing with wallets. It took me until 2013 to fully appreciate bitcoin. If you haven't I suggest you play with testnet, send payments to yourself, make and restore testnet wallets, make paper wallets,  multisig wallets,  just try lots of things. That hands on experience is what helped me understand it and trust it completley. In 2019 I have a revival of bitcoin spirit thanks to the lightning network and built a node for the same purpose, to play, to learn.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:46:12
Bitcoin's price as reported is arbitrary. In the code the fundamental unit is the satoshi. There is no "bitcoin" in the code. For cosmetic reasons only on the GUI of the original client, the decimal was placed where it is making 1btc = 100,000,000sat. And it simply became convention.
Think of it this way, if you buy $1 of bitcoin today are you buying 0.00029940 bitcoin or 29,940 satoshis? It's arbitrary where you decide to place the decimal. And thus the equivalent price is arbitrarily dependent on the units you choose to display.
You saying it's a million times overvalued is the literall equivalent of saying someone's too tall because you reported their height in nanometers. 
If you want to compare bitcoin to a stock, then you need to compare the price of the fundamental units. In terms of satoshis the price of bitcoin is $0.0000334 per today.
Personally I've been using the millibit (0.001btc = 1mBTC) for a few years because that's roughly equivalent to everyday values of things and stocks. The last ATH cycle saw the price go from $0.20 mBTC to $19 mBTC and back to $3.35 mBTC. Will we see a $100 mBTC in the future? Not unreasonable at all to think so.

It seems most of the 'package file invalid' fixes that a quick google search reveals are a separate issue that google seems to have resolved in August. Because it is a vauge non-informative error, i suspected something separate was the cause. I found this report tonight and the current package file invalid issue some of us are getting from Gyft may be on the development end after all?

has anyone had trouble with the gyft app? I had the gyft app since they very first accepted bitcoin and it worked with no issues. In November one of the updates rolled out and I got the google 'package file is invalid' error. Reinstalling and just about any other fix I found has not worked. Gyft support told me they cannot do anything since it is a play store issue and they suggested I use the gyft website to access my account in the meantime. Frustrating to have some unexplained google glitch keep me from using my bitcoins with gyft on my phone like OP, especially now with the new stores gyft added. I just wondered if anyone here has had this problem and maybe knows of a fix.
