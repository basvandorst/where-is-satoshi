The people have forgotten they're supposed to be a big player. We've been letting our democracy slip away from us, largely because we've been buying more and more the propaganda against collective power as too leftist/"communist"
... but honestly, all the fears about the bankers/finance/capital being in control of all your assets ... like, that's what political organizing is supposed to counter.
Hyperindividualism and unregulated markets are a step backwards, not forward.

So, who decides on this "minimal" regulation? It must be democratically determined, or else it's "big players." That's my argument. If you're for some societal regulation, "free market" loses meaning. It doesn't mean anything anyway, markets are collectively managed or they are nothing.

I agree America is not small-d democratic enough. That jives with my argument perfectly.

I wasn't even aware Mr Robot had a worldview. If anything, the eponymous Mr Robot wanted to destroy a giant corporation, which is a bit different. I think at best he imagined a jubilee, which is also distinct from wealth redistribution... And many of the other actors carrying out the various actions have vastly different motivations. Which is part of why it's such a dang good big time show.

Businesses can always accept cash and keep it in their back room or in a safe. What's the significant difference from accepting bitcoin and storing the bitcoin [data] on the computer in their back room or in a safe? Aren't the bigger hurdles to starting a business complying with tax and hiring laws? Which we want them to do, right?
