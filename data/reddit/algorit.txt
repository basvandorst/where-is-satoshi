Without the internet such ignorance couldn't be put on display, so thanks for the entertainment.
Typical redditor talking shit about a company and era they know nothing about, providing no sources for their claims, and being generally insufferable. Bravo.

I think your memory is a little misguided. The IBM PC was a pretty great success. Even the ThinkPad brand still exists - Lenovo purchased it. 
IBM still makes their Power processors and updates Linux accordingly, which is obviously a win for open-source. The Xbox 360 used a Power CPU and the PS3 used a cell processor which IBM helped make.
As antiquated as the word "Mainframe" is, IBM made those too and many "mission-critical" applications run on them today.
In short, I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here. IBM has always done well in computing.

No, I don't care either.
@_date: 2014-09-06 04:16:38
I read it, you're just wrong. The Apple II was good, III not so much.

You can also check your local bitcoin meetup, they usually have a portion dedicated to helping people set up wallets and bitpay partners etc.

Sounds like any large company. Unsurprisingly, not every thing they do works and not every idea is a success story.
@_date: 2014-09-06 17:03:26
That's funny because you haven't linked anything to back yourself up. You can find everything I've relayed to you on wikipedia. 
Remember to put on your helmet and drool cup next time.

I tried that and keep getting "We're sorry, an application error has occurred. Goodbye!"
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:39:42
I think the real problem is that you are immature.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:48:41
Being immature is not my problem, it's yours.
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:54:49
Maybe new to the earth, I'm a moon creature !! You guys are taking me back !! To the moon !!
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:34:44
The probability of that happening to the dollar is much lower than bitcoin. I love bitcoin, but let's be real.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:43:46
Just a bit-lieber! Like, belieber, but bitcoin!! To the moon!

Maybe you should be less sensitive to things. And I didn't say you were wasting your life, I said basically that what his username is matters not to you and that it's silly to care. You responded with an insult, and are acting like a child.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:58:01
it won't being going "back up" because it's not going down ~~ to the moon!!
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:39:14
Lots of rhetorical rights in there. This time is different. This is organic growth. The fundamentals are different. To the moon!!
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:42:29
Assuming constant difficulty? If so, that's not a safe assumption.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:26:30
What a ridiculous statement.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:43:42
The problem is not with windows. I don't know how else to tell you this. People need to be educated about how to protect their information, regardless of operating system, in order to be secure on any platform.

He can buy back...there is nothing barring him from resuming a position when he sees fit.

I think, however, that it is important to note that multiple addresses can belong to one person. Hence that person could have the 111,111 BTC plus another 100k more on peer accounts in the wallet in various amounts.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:27:08
Honestly I think it belongs between $20 and $30 and doesn't yet deserve to be double its previous value of ~$17. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:03:07
Who cares
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:50:44
or what you're saying, without links.
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:03:19
You can exercise proper security on a machine using a windows operating system. The issue you have is with the users of the machines.
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:24:39
I don't understand how such a statement can be made. What do you define "soon" to be?
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:15:13
The OS does not matter. You can get OSX infected, Linux and Unix too.

They have not delivered ASICs, but are reputable FPGA sellers. I don't think delivery is a worry, but timely delivery is another matter.

Malware is often written for the largest platform. If OSX was more prominent than windows you can bet there would be more malware for it and unix variants.

When I do verify by phone I still get "We're sorry, an application error has occurred. Goodbye!".
Thanks for your response!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:06:29
That's great, but life is too short to care about pedantic things like that. Maybe you'll see when you grow up.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:32:38
More like waiting for the posts from people left holding the bag.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:33:36
These are my sentiments as well, my opinion is that its true value lies between $20 and $30 at the moment.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:35:19
You told someone to delete their username because it was incorrect and seemed to offend you. Things don't work like this. I don't know who you think you are but you need to get a grip and think before you speak.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:12:11
Thank you for your comment, glad to know I'm not alone.
