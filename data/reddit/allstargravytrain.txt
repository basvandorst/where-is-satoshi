I'll take a "deeply flawed" consensus system anytime over the current corrupt banking system.

He's too invested in the traditional banking system, off of which he's made millions and millions.  Government is his friend in all of this, which is why he wants them to shut it down.  Imagine he went to the US gov't and asked them to backstop his Bear Stearns purchase with bitcoin? hahaha, different question...

Noob question: if you generate a private key offline (as you are supposed to do - either by rolling dice or through a program/wallet), how can you be sure it hasn't already been "picked" yet? I know there are a gazillion potential private keys but it's not infinite, right?  And there is a small chance it has been picked before, no?

This was posted for me by a user during a mentor monday a while back.  I found it very useful in conceptualizing this collision issue:

Thanks for the reply.  Makes sense.  I suppose it's like having the same lottery number 10 times in a row or something.  
Still, even if negligible, in theory it is possible... if it does happen then the corresponding bitcoin address that would be out there is effectively hacked - correct? 
I'm just thinking out loud.  Let's say bitcoin does scale to be a global currency over the next few decades.  Presumably this will mean there are billions and billions and billions of bitcoin addresses created (from random private key generation).  I wonder if you ran the math, what the chances are that a random private key would correspond to an already created public key/address... it's can't quite be zero, could it?

$11.8 billion AUM is small/med size??  That can't be right... are you benchmarking against all other pools of capital?  Like pension funds, bond funds, etc.?

Guys, two questions:
1) what are the risks of giving them your bank info?
2) how do you "be your own bank?"  
Sorry for the basic nature of these questions - guidance would be much appreciated!

yea but the question is - is it insured???

I've heard the discrepancy is because of dumping in China. No idea if accurate but I noticed the same. Coinbase price is way above coin market cap price...

Can someone ELI5 on this? For non technical people...

Yes, it's preposterous to say Iceland has a "strong" currency... just an ignorant statement.  They've had capital controls since 2008.
