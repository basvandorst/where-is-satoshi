As regards similar fee-free stock trading, there's a UK-based service starting up 'early 2018' [freetrade.io](
Be nice if they copy Robinhood and delve into crypto, but they haven't even launched yet.

It's correct in the same way that running into the Bank of England and screaming "The bank doesn't actually have deposits on hand to cover what everyone has in their accounts!" is correct. Well duh. Did you *just* read the Wikipedia entry for Fractional Reserve Banking and now you think you're the only guy in the world who knows this 'dark secret'?
Your comments about Bitcoin are the same. Utterly childish, incredibly obvious facts that *everybody* knows, dressed up to sound dramatic, profoundly uninformed about the deeper meanings and important details. You screech these infantile pronouncements imagining yourself to be a soothsayer among sheep.
Seriously, stop wasting your time here and go work on your education.


So you are suggesting that most people believe that Bitcoin is regulated? And that its value is based on some material commodity? No, you know perfectly well that not a single person in the entire world believes that. So who are you addressing?
Fucking trolls. How utterly fucking miserable, pathetic and BORED does a person have to be to do nothing more than deliberately post garbage? It doesn't take intelligence, or wit, or courage. It requires a complete absence of all three.

OK, so PayPal currently have seller protection for goods posted (with proof) to a 'verified address'. I can imagine a process - as laborious* as necessary for the sake of security - for a PayPal user to set up a verified cryptocurrency address. Once this is done, that user can buy cryptocurrency from a seller. The seller sends to the verified address. Perfect proof of an above-board transaction.
*Example of laborious process: PayPal mail a code to your verified physical address. This code is then used when registering your cryptocurrency address to your PayPal account. I could probably think of variations or other methods of making the registration process satisfactorily secure.

Yep, saw that. There's still a discussion to be had. For one thing, they are in a perfect position to enable completely secure transactions from fiat to crypto, protecting both buyer and seller, and would profit from doing so. I can describe the perfect implementation but I won't bore you. It's quite trivial.
For another thing, the categorisation of cryptocurrency and how laws relating to currency transactions relate to trade of crypto is a very open question at this point.
Importantly right now, ebay is facilitating thousands of crypto sales, taking fees, and then encouraging buyers to commit fraud. They either need to make a very clear ban (and enforce it), or take simple steps to protect sellers of crypto.

Two final points: List smallish quantities (&lt;$50). The larger the listing, the more likely to be snapped up by a scammer. Naturally they prefer a big hit, as if they are using a stolen account they only get one shot.
Secondly, do not list multiples. For the same reason as above. A scammer will snap up all available quantity on a multi-listing in one hit. This is usually a clear sign that you have a scammer on your hands!

Well, how do they handle chargebacks when the seller qualifies for their seller protection at present, having posted with proof to a verified address? Transfer for crypto is FAR, FAR MORE secure than any postal service. It's not like the buyer can pretend they received an empty box or faulty goods.
Delivery is proven absolutely and trivially by the blockchain, of course.

Right, so far they have appeared to want nothing to do with it. But they must be weighing their options by now. The countless chargebacks must be very expensive for PayPal, however they decide each case. Just in time spent in resolution and loss of upset customers. I'm putting this opinion out there - that PayPal have a lot to gain by feasible measures to enable cryptocurrency transactions - because you never know who might pick up on it and get to thinking. Clearly David Marcus has been thinking about the subject.

Of course it depends on what he meant by 'enough' - enough to live the lifestyle of a homeowner with an above average job without actually working, or enough to satisfy all of one's fantasies?

Of course, I made that point above. When a loan shark gives someone a loan at 2000%APR, is it completely ethical? The guy didn't have to take the loan after all.
It's called taking advantage of people. The fact that I constantly flirt with my overdraft limit is my own fault. The fact that the bank LOVES me because of this and rips me off with unseemly disproportionate fines is their shameful fault.
If LloydsTSB allow you to disable going over the limit and reject all payments, they certainly do not advertise the fact. And why would they? I'm their favourite type of customer. Bottom line is that the fines are criminally disproportionate to the bank's costs.
