The future.

Do we misuse the IP network stack with gaming and or DDOS? IP was never designed to be used for watching porn, reddit, facebook, botnets, etc. Bitcoin is just a protocol. It has to deal with it.

Crypto is it's own economy, it is not bound to the classical economy.

The alternative is this:
A group of a lot of people decided to build the IP/TCP stack of value (which we call money).
The description is way shorter,  , thus (way) more likely.

It is extremely unlikely because it is/was so much work. Plus the bitcoin codebase was (probably) in an extremely good condition. So we would need to find a "person" who:
* has extremely deep knowledge of cryptography
* has good enough programming/software engineering skills
* could finance the time required to read and write papers and software
* likes anarchy
This is extremely unlikely to find in a single person. Pretty much 0%.

What's going ONNN?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:08:41






















It was most likely a group or company or dark .gov project.

\&gt;The flow of Bitcoin usage must begin and end with fiat currencies
This is so wrong - nothing stops people from selling/buying commodities and services for bitcoin directly.

Bitcoin was not about money - it is about trust

Try to remember your own tulip - that's a lot more bytes
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:07:20
When do people compare tulips with the internet?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:21:03
bitcoin is fiat too

2011 - no - 2015 - no - it's all the same
