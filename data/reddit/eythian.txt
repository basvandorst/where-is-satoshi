Chromium is free software, I'd trust it more than chrome.

[Qt also has an accessibility API]( - this might be a good starter project for someone wanting to learn more about it, or wanting to stick their toe into free software development.

Heh, a friend of mine came here (New Zealand) for a while, from Georgia (the US state.) When saying she was "from Georgia", a common response was "wow, your English is really good!"

Chrome isn't free/open source software, therefore it increases your risk.

As much as I wish they'd kept that, it wasn't really a feature. It required directly launching an activity to get to (i.e. you _needed_ something 3rd party to get to it), and it would make apps crash if they couldn't handle being denied access to things they didn't expect. It was pretty clear it was something not intended for end-user use.
There are apps that'll do the equivalent thing. They do require root access though.

I have a nexus 4, also an aging transformer. The n4 is great at being a portable Internet device, and I can vpn in to work if I need to. Same with the transformer, though it's mostly for books and games that suit a big screen. 
Laptops and desktops are all Ubuntu because I'm used to it, and like the way it works, and it's really great for development. Windows and Mac feel really awkward and restrictive to me. 
I am usually wary of vendor additions, like Samsung does, hence going for the Nexus phone. My next tablet will probably be one also. 
All that aside, you can't play Ingress on an iPhone without being banned :-)

It's a silly argument because it's a false analogy. Any device that doesn't allow you to control how you use it isn't yours.

I have an android. I can access the file system. I can use it like a tiny, convenient laptop. I can install anything I like, and can remove anything I don't like. I don't want an appliance, I want a general purpose computing device that will let me do anything I want it to. And I have one. 
In my opinion, it's also more useful than an iPhone, for example with it's inter-app communication, but that's because my workflows have adapted to make use of it. If you've never had it, it'd be normal to work around the shortcomings of the OS.

Don't tick the box that allows you to side-load apps. Problem solved. It's a conscious choice, that presents a warning, to open this functionality.
Basically it's saying "well, you can do this if you want, but don't say we didn't warn you!"
I much prefer that to the Apple model of "No! Bad user!"

That's a silly argument. But you can keep your etch-a-sketch, while I'll stick with a portable general purpose computer.
