**Bitcoin’s place in the world economy**
As you may have realized, Bitcoin could in theory serve as a more efficient form of currency than the fiat currency’s we use today. However the question remains that even though this is true, where would Bitcoin fit in as a predominant form of currency and how would it help or hurt trade? First off, Bitcoin will give the seller a shorter waiting period to confirm the transfer of funds than credit cards, debit cards, and checks require. When a transaction is made with Bitcoin, the funds are confirmed within 45 minutes or even sooner. Secondly, since Bitcoin is based on a peer to peer network the transfer costs that are incurred with today’s forms of electronic payment are basically eliminated. This in effect eliminates the huge sum of money which businesses pay to banks every year in order to accept these forms of electronic payment such as credit cards and debit cards. Thirdly, the block chain which holds a record of all Bitcoin transactions ever completed is a more efficient system of record holding than has ever been in existence with respect to transfers of money. Also, the block chain give you access to view the actual balances of money in every single Bitcoin wallet at any given time. The existence of the block chain is a huge advantage for people or businesses who wish to confirm that a customer has a specified amount of money available before providing them with a good or service, something that sellers have to assume without such information.
Ultimately, Bitcoin could be used as the predominant currency throughout the world, especially considering the trend of globalization given our instantaneous access to knowledge and unlimited social interaction through the use of the internet. Given the information listed so far, it makes sense why the world would benefit from a utilizing a uniform currency like Bitcoin. However, in my opinion Bitcoin is not yet ready for widespread adoption. Even though the fundamental truths of the currency are strong, there are still things that need to be done in order to achieve widespread recognition and adoption.
**What needs to be done**
To start off, in my opinion, the major concern with Bitcoin’s ability to achieve widespread recognition is the issue of volatility. Everyone who has been following the value of Bitcoin and even people who haven’t are probably aware of the incredible increase in value of BTC over the past few months. In terms of dollars, the price of Bitcoin is up about 750% from exactly two months ago. This meteoric rise is enough to give concern to economists and speculators, and rightly so. There is no way that a currency, or “medium of exchange”, could be a viable form of payment when the value is so volatile. For example, there were multiple instances in the past weeks when the price would change 10% or more in one day in either a positive or negative direction. How could one expect any of the big businesses in today’s marketplace to take the risk of accepting a form of payment which could be worth 10% less within 24 hours, or 750% less in 2 months from the time of the exchange? The answer is that you couldn’t expect businesses to take this risk and without stable prices there is no chance that Bitcoin could ever achieve widespread adoption.
From this point forward, the question should be “How do we reach a point where the value of Bitcoin is stable?” Of course there is always going to be the effect of increasing value due to the nature of the deflationary economy; however it is necessary that the currency hold a steady and predictable measure of value for a given period of time. A stable value of Bitcoin would be achieved when the value can be predicted by using the deflation multiplier to predict how much more the currency is going to be worth in a given amount of time due simply to the nature of deflationary economy, and not so heavily reliant on speculation and price fluctuations due to investors using Bitcoin as a vehicle for currency swaps, which is ever-so prevalent in the current Bitcoin marketplace.
Although it is clear that Bitcoin’s value needs to be constant, the question of how to go about achieving such a task is very difficult to answer and should be left up for further debate. However there are some things that could be stated with certainty: firstly there needs to be a larger amount of people that hold Bitcoin with the intentions of using it to spend on goods, and not to trade for a form of fiat currency in hopes of gaining a profit. Secondly, at the same time, there needs to be a large amount of firms who accept Bitcoin as a form of payment that offer a wide range of products and services which is comparable to the range of goods and services offered in exchange for fiat currency. However, even before either of these things can happen, there needs to be a better understanding among the masses of the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the reasons why it has such huge potential to do great things for the world economy. This paper was written with the hopes of spreading the knowledge of the value of using Bitcoin beyond the hardcore believers, in turn building upon the advancement of the currency toward widespread adoption.
I hope that what I have outlined in this essay will give the reader a clear understanding of how Bitcoin has the potential to change the global economy for the better. However, although there are great opportunities that the currency offers, what must be realized is the potential political and social reforms and possibly unrest that could result due to a major shift from fiat to crypto currencies. Considering that the world economy is so reliant upon each nation’s respective fiat currency, what must occur for a crypto currency to gain an edge over these currencies is some event which deems them “inferior” to the potential of the use of crypto currencies instead. An example of an event which would cause this outcome could be the United States defaulting on its debt obligations, causing catastrophic damages to the political and social structure of not only the United States but the world as a whole. The results of such an event would most likely include the devaluation of the dollar and widespread distrust in the United States government. In addition, there could possibly be dissolution of some government run organizations, particularly those that deal with the regulation of the dollar and financial markets. Through the midst of these political and social reforms, unrest among large populations could very well occur.
Although one may that argue that the chances of the adoption of Bitcoin may just as well occur through a more gradual process which is not necessarily so extreme, it is undeniable that there will be some social and political reforms as a result. It is for these reasons that I do not believe Bitcoin will be adopted on a large scale in the near future, however the potential is ever present.
In closing I would like to state again that this document expresses only my observations and opinions and it is written in hopes of giving new-comers some insight into what kind of potential Crypto Currencies actually have. Although this essay was not written for the purpose of receiving donations, they would be greatly appreciated if you find it in your interest to contribute. Being a college student, even the smallest amounts help. My address is listed below. Also, I urge you to share this document with people who you believe would be interested. The more people who understand Bitcoin, the closer we will be to widespread adoption!
