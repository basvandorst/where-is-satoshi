That means...? It doesn't count since they're converting the BitCoins into euros and instead of using them?

It's almost like idiots with reality-show education can take part in the presidential elections too, not to mention the super-popular candidate Trump had to oppose.
The only cognitive dissonance is to believe that he's good at anything other than persuading mouth breathing morons... and there's no shortage of those in America, obviously. 
You can believe what you want, and FYI - I find this tragicomic demise of USA amusing -, but don't try to draw parallels between that parody of a man and an elegant new technology that is Bitcoin and Blockchain.

Riight. The conspiracy that Trump actually isn't an idiot - he's just pretending. He just acts like he doesn't know what he's doing about, speaks like a child, conducts himself like a bufoon, loses allies left and right, can't do anything legislativly, despite having the house and the senate, not to mention all the PR catastrophies.. because it's part of the plan. You have to live in America to be caught in that delusion, I guess - for anyone looking outside in, it couldn't be any clearer.


No, he actually obviously is one. He's the most obvious idiot I can think of. "Nevermind what he does and says, look at his high-school grades". Can the bar get any lower?

No he isn't. He's senile, spoiled and  hilariously incompetent moron, that is excusively supported by braindead americans. Don't try to smear that shitstain on the beauty that is Bitcoin.

Can this retarded cunt not be leaked into bitcoin please? It's enough of him everywhere else.

In what reality, you delusional man? What has he accomplished? You understand that he's hasn't done anything, is the laughinstock of the world and has greatly damaged Americas soft power? 


Do you understand that his cabinet is filled with bankers, right?
He's an inspiration for halfwits everywhere - that I can give you.
