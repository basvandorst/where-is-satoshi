If Jihan does not see this, he is stupid (which I do not buy), or he has an agenda for Bitcoin that has incentives coming from outside those provided inside Bitcoin, (if you know what I mean).  His masters should be coin holders.  If he doesn't climb down out of the BU tree now, then I would guess, his motives are of The Party.

This is the first pre-dawn light on a winter day in the "then you win" stage.
Fidelity has large private equity holdings.  Fidelity is one of the larger control entities in the fiat world.  Fidelity, and maybe ten other larger investment companies, own controlling interests of much of the world worth controlling.  Big banks, big media, milcom, strategic blue chips, all with 40% plus ownership by these big investment companies.  That gives these investment companies control over boards of directors membership and thus strategic control over almost everything worth controlling.  
The private equity within the investment companies provide even more leverage for the owners of this equity within them.  In reality, they own nowhere near a majority but they gain control by coordinated investment and control of boards.  
The big banks, that have most direct access to "loans" from central banks, own and are owned by these same private equity rich investment companies.  
This is how the hidden 0.0001% own and control the planet.  The private equity is cleansed and put through mazes before it can be traced to the tip top of control.  
Fidelity and the few others that have multi $T under management are the public face of the hidden holders of planet controlling wealth.  
This is no white flag by Fidelity or its controllers, that a manager likes Bitcoin, but it certainly is worthy of our cheer.  They think they can control the honey badger.  It will absorb them into its neutral protocol and they won't even know what happened.  Consider the print division of NY Times.

The point that was proven with the drama fest of the past few years is that "what miners want" matters very little.  If they do not service the users and the value, they are harming Bitcoin.  
Want another fork? Go ahead, see how much of the investment follows you.  Mining follows investors, NOT!!! the other way.  The miners can't force anything.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:46:56
Well, I would like to agree, I think that this point requires a modification.
A fork offers two paths.  Investors/hodlers choose the success of each.  Nothing else puts life into a crytpo.  Not Big Men On Campus like Roger Ver, not miners, like Jihan, not coders even.  The fork path that achieves value is successful.  Every fork provides an opportunity for attraction of real world resource.  The recent fork provides evidence to such. Not only did one side of the fork get 10X the value of the other, the over all value of the two is 20% + greater than than originating coin.  
This input of value is almost pure market.  The barriers to entry and transfer of crypto are the lowest of any asset in history.  Trading real world resource into the value of any fork is super easy and cheap.  
 So, we should not fear fork attempts.  They either improve the value and persist, or they do not and become back eddies (bc cash).  The net effect is a further and further increase of real world value being rewarded to the winner.  
We also proved that Bitcoin as an asset is what matters to the market.  Transaction capacity matters very secondary.  Ie, We are presented a choice and chose decentralization, IMO.  
That said, now that there is a high capacity choice of fork of Bitcoin, we do not need 2X right now.  
I am sure there will be much cursing and arm waving but 2X will time out with much ado ending in nothing.

Bitcoin needs developers to develop successful defenses against the variety of attacks that can be safely assumed to happen from the split that will happen either from a hardfork or a UASF.   In either case, it is pretty clear that there will probably a significant majority of mining hashrate that will go to a &gt; 1MB block blockchain.   
It doesn't matter anymore what miners think.  Their interests are first in maintaining the drama, second in maintaining power after a split and a distant distant third, serving the large long term interests of the Bitcoin experiment.   
The large part of the wallets and exchanges are behind SegWit.  The price deltas with Wang Chun and Jihan Wu's trollery for SegWit implementation on Vertcoin, Litecoin and clearly now for Bitcoin too, demonstrate where the heart of investors is at. 
Miners are terribly out of sync with the community.  Whatever their motivation is, it is not for "Bitcoin."  
Until developers start making code proposals to win the spirit of Bitcoin back, I think we should start to wonder about the motivations of developers too.  
1) SegWit hardfork with 75% acceptance including a 1.2 MB max block size parameter.  And see how it goes.  You want it, you got it.  
2) A plan to defend a &lt; 1MB block network with much less than 50% of the world's SHA256 power.  A blockchain of the willing.  If that can not be done, Bitcoin can not be defended against the $100T fiat system. 
Start playing to win.  This is adversarial.  Jihan and Wang (and Jiang and....) don't give a crap about destroying the fiat monster.  
I dunno, I still do.

More philosophical than technical you say?  Surely you jest. 
In order to maintain scarcity of the imaginary notion, "the dollar," authority has been vested upon a central bank and its chartered front line borrowers (banks) with strict law to not abuse their power to undo scarcity.   Of course, the power to control scarcity has been abused to the benefit of those privileged to be in authority.  
Blockchain money (the blockchain's first and most important application) removes centralized human authority as scarcity managers and as ledger managers.  2^256 quantity of addresses puts security on the user where it is alot tougher to hack.  
Banks are dead walking, along with centralized media companies, intelligence agencies and government.  Note how they have gone from all singing the same hymns to complete infighting between them in just a few years.  
Truth can not come from authority.  That is insane.  Truth in accounting is no different.  The blockchain is an accounting innovation.  Banks use 600 year old accounting on computers that has been corruptible since the Medici's invented it.  
Philosophical for sure, but so much more.

That's right, but to me it is irrelevant.  
Do I really care about a 30% drop after a 6X gain?  Not really.  I am into crypto because it represents opportunity - gains, safety from fiat failure, new ideas.  So when I go to use it as money, do I care that it was 30% higher last week?  
I don't buy into the idea that because it is volatile in price it is useless, at all.  It is not useful for some things especially at a macro level. But it is much more useful at other things.  It can do anything fiat can but oh so much more.  
Maybe it never gets to fiat level stability (ie 10% volatility per annum for the biggest brute ever made.).  It will need a valuation and cultural acceptance much higher than today.    I think it will get there and that fiat-ists will either have to begin to behave (but then why bother) or their pet will be abandoned.

Can't ban signing messages with long numbers.  Can't ban me from giving up something of value in exchange for a message that moves some digits to the blockchain that allows me to move some digits later onto the blockchain by signing with a really long number that only I know.  Can't force me to define money in any particular way....

@_date: 2017-09-21 23:01:52
True enough.  I use cryptos for savings too.  Overly invested really.  But I do use them for money and currency purposes from time to time.   The volatility is quite upward trending so I don't worry about that.  I just hold as long as I can and spend when I need to.  
I think that Bitcoin won't become currency until it reaches a similar volatility to say gold.  USDollar is down 10% this year so what is not volatile?
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:23:45
I disagree.  
Fiat currency has no intrinsic properties that can have value whatsoever.  (Value is subjective, of course but skepticism can not be applied equally to all subjects.) 
Gold does.  It has specific properties and quantity produced by forces far beyond us.  It is beautiful and rare. It has a deeply held cultural valuation and its subjectivity of value is undeniable enough to be nearly intrinsic. 
Bitcoin has a huge intrinsic properties that are valuable.  It has an indelible accounting ledger.  The first global, perfect accounting.   It's main trunk has never been terminated.  Not one satoshi faked.  It has spawned a $10B grafted branch (BCH). This accounting property is  what governments tell us they are safeguarding by controlling central banks.  Like everything else governments do, it is more lie than truth.  
Fiat has no intrinsic properties worth value, none. It is valuable by the most fallible notion known, the promise of honesty by humans.  Government currency has money-like properties, but it can never be money.  
Only gold is money.  Bitcoin (and one other, M.....) stands a pretty good chance of becoming money.  
 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:27:21
I know what I am talking about.  National Banks are central banks. 
I have decided to ignore the false dialectic that a Central Bank created by state and owned by a small group of private individuals (Fascistic) is distinct in any meaningful way from a National Central Bank created by state and owned by a small group of state authorities (Communistic). The preference for having a central bank has led to an aggregation of global power of fiat in very narrow hands.  They are all controlled save a few by the same group.  
Fascism is Communism's close cousin.  They are both Socialism. The difference is a 20th Century false dialectic and is without distinction. Millions murdered by both in the 20th Century.  Both Machievellian artificial excuses to gain popular support for autocracy.   
You would do well not to swallow the definitions fed to you.   It won't serve you well to fall for a manufactured false choice.   But go ahead and choose to live with the abuse of a National Bank and think it is superior to a Central Bank.  "Capitalism" within a system of a central bank isn't really the Capitalism that most imagine.  There are no markets whatsoever without voluntary pricing.  There is no voluntary pricing in a money that is controlled centrally.  
Marxism itself, even if it has heartfelt following, is an excuse to gain power.  
The same people that have implemented Central Banking on the planet promote Marxism/Socialism/leftism.  The very same individuals.  
It is all a cover for power seeking.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:32:29

You are the one asserting that they can just "ban" it.  I said provide the legal pseudo code.  
"We ban XYZ." is an impotent joke if you can't put some teeth to it.  
Sure, it's not easy to create a new kind of money.  But the definition of money is a product of the market, the individual really, not the state.  The state can remove non state choices until they can't.  Gold is money through all human conditions.  The state has nothing to say about it, utterly impotent to get people to conform. 
So again, tell me how Bitcoin can be "banned" without bringing the populous to a pre communication tech status. Ie, A society can have Bitcoin in its midst or be North Korea.

Plank  Communist Manifesto (Author Karl Marx):
 5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
So I guess I should be more clear.  Central Banking is a tool of autocracy and thus finds an eager bed partner with Marxism.  I think that the term Capitalist is an abused term when it is used to equate free markets and finance with central banks.  Central Bank Capitalism is not free market.
So just as "Fascism" and "Communism" are the right and left wings of "Socialism,"  central banking is the antitheses of freedom.  That is to say that power seekers use these as tools of propaganda to gain followership.  
 It is no coincidence that the anti-freedom side of politics gathers a rainbow of isms, including Marxism and Central Banks.  
The term Capitalism is not really the same thing as freedom though Capitalists (ie bankers) would like us to believe that it does.
I would actually go so far as to say that most "isms" are merely superstitions designed to create an excuse for autocracy.

This is the list of the "Primary Dealer Banks" in the USA.  That means these banks borrow directly from the Federal Reserve.  Since Federal Reserve Notes are balance sheet items that are increased or decreased by the "fiat" of the Federal Reserve, these Primary Dealers have an enourmous benefit versus you or me when it comes to borrowing money. In some countries, these banks get money at NEGATIVE interest rates.  They also know when and how much the direction changes.  These benefits are huge.  Anyone who uses the Federal Reserve Note gets to bear the burden by virtue of legal tender laws.  
These Primary Dealers own the shares of the Regional Fed Reserve Banks, who then own the Federal Reserve.  The regional Feds were set up in the days of telegraph and newspapers and are now a bit of an anachronism.  So the Primary Dealers own and control the Fed Reserve to their own benefit.    Some will tell you that the Federal Reserve system is a benign helpful institution created by the USGov.  They will say, look, the Federal Reserve is a creation of Congress (true), it is independent of politics (true), the chairs are government appointees (true), and the Federal Reserve is non-profit (true), so no problems, right?
Wrong!!  The Primary Dealers - and the big 6 comprise again 95%+ - get to allocate all the capital in the US Dollar (Fed Reserve Note) system, which is something like a third of all capital on the planet.  And they borrow at advantageous interest rates and create advantage for friends.  
This system is replicated worldwide.  Almost all government currency is controlled by related Central Banks.   Only a few tiny countries have Central Banks not tightly controlled by this group.  It might not be too surprising to find out that Iran, North Korea and Venezuela are truly independent and Russia, China and Brazil are trying hard to break out of the orbit.   
Refer to the works of Eustace Mullens, Smedley Butler and the book Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Ronald Bernard.  
There is a globalized effort to have over-laid fiat monopolies.  It is nearly accomplished.  This is the purpose of war. You will find monetary systems at the heart of conflict since Ancient Greece.  
Choice of what is considered valuable and what is therefore money is a fundamental expression of individual conscience.  
A fiat monopoly, then, also requires enforcement and propaganda.  It requires a deep obeisance to your rulers and a very heavy hierarchy of feudalistic cruelty.    Government is to control you, but money controls government.  
Welcome to your cruel hierarchical warring planet.

The big ones can and do.  In most countries, only a few banks have license to borrow directly from their central bank.  
In the USA, greater than 95% (I think it is 97 or 98%) of direct dealing of Federal Reserve Notes is performed by the Big 6 banks.  They are also the "owners" of the Fed Reserve Regional Banks (NY, St Louis, etc) and thus the "owners" of the Federal Reserve in about that same proportion.  
However, the big banks all own one another substantially and they are also owned substantially by other large investment firms that are controlled by the same entities.  Controlling interest of this 97% control of the US dollar (more accurately the Fed Reserve Note) is very very very narrowly held. 
The history of war, revolution and empire is one of dominance.  Do you really imagine there is any fundamental difference between a Saxon from Saxony and an Anglo-Saxon from England that millions should die in ditches for the difference.  I do not.  War is about dominance by those at the tip of the dominance hierarchy in the respective society to gain the resources of the dominance hierarchy of its rival.  
The pinnacle power within the modern state is the control of money.  Everything else can be purchased.
The entire purpose of the vast violence committed by the USA since the second half of the Great War is to promote the US dollar hegemony.  The success of this endeavour is real. 
The benefit has not fallen primarily to the citizens between the Rio Grande and the 49th parallel but to the owners of the Federal Reserve Bank. 
That's how Wall Street kills.  Explained like you are 50.

It is not inconsistent, just incorrect.  
The first blockchain is Bitcoin.  It is the most relevant by far.  Bitcoin was invented as an open protocol for value transfer, the Internet of money.  The blockchain's first, most important, and (until demonstrated otherwise) only!! application is money transfer.  Again the intended and only application of the blockchain is money.  That is still the standing truth.  Bitcoin is still the dominant application of the technology.  
The Federal Reserve Bank and its primary dealers (like JPM) and their executives are frauds.  Bitcoin has never altered a balance sheet fraudulently.  The Federal Reserve most certainly has.  The very imposition of fiat currency onto a nation through legal tender legislation is a fraud of "patriotism."   JPM is a serial mass fraudster. 
Jamie Dimon is a fraud.  Bitcoin is not.  Open source software, decentralized operation, low barriers to entry, perfect accounting record.  Show me the fake money!

All national banks are central banks.  Marx wanted national (ie central banks).  Marxism is an economic philosophy of convenience.  It is meant to rouse the rabble, not as a coherent system of philosophy, economics or politics.  It is simplistic soul numbing drivel and can not work in practice because it doesn't have any mechanics or ethics  whatsoever. The idea that there are distinct class groups was a passing notion.  Marxists in practice create as much division as they possibly can and the wealthy just lie to the mobs and sprinkle a little of the sugar around here and there.   
Canada has a national bank.  Canada is a very pretty globalist pet. The ECB is not private.  Very globalist.  Bank of Japan is national.  Very much in service of globalists. 
 All central banks serve inflation and taxation theft.  They all serve their chartered banks.  They all support other central banks.   A central bank serves oligarchy whatever shade of paint it wears. There are Marxist leaders (Stalin, Mao) who murder their followers by the millions and harvest their lives through central banks, among other techniques.  And there are Marxist dupes that follow them.    Just as there are "Capitalist" leaders (the dynastical banking families), who equally murder and harvest lives of their dupes. 
Money melded with authority has been a form of duplicity, murder and war since the ancients diluted silver coins, since the invention of paper gold receipts all the way through.  
Marxists adore central banking.  So do dynastic banking families. There is no kinder, gentler central bank type.

I really wasn't trying to accuse you of that.  
I am putting forth that for something to be money, it must have intrinsic properties that might be valued.  I agree that there is no such thing as hard un-subjective intrinsic value.  But gold for example again, has intrinsic properties that can be value, and such a deep connection to human civilization that its value is nearly non-subjective.  I agree, this could change.  Its value IS NOT intrinsic, but it surely approximates it better than anything else.
I am saying, that money must have intrinsic properties that can be valued.  Gold has such properties.  So does Bitcoin (and moreseo even Monero).  Cryptos do not have the same cultural acceptance as gold.  
Cryptos might be defeated or just disregarded.  
So only gold is money.  Fiat is not.  Cryptos stand a chance.    
Fiat is a promise by "governors" to not cheat.  What could be less interesting than promises of thugs?

No. It is possible to have two persistent branches, each "valid" and each with "the most work behind it" for its own ruleset. 
If they each have market support, ie, a non-trivial price, then they both can persist.

Chain splits are NOT inflation.  
It's simple.  Yes, the number of units multiply.  
Ownership does not dilute.  The problem of monetary inflation is that the owners of the units prior to inflation become diluted.  Their units become worth a little less while someone else gets the seigniorage.  This is not the case in a chain splits.  Your private key has the same proportion as prior.  
Now if someone is able to change the rules such that there becomes inflation of the overall monetary units within that chain, well that is the crime of fiat money.  The difference in crypto is that no-one is compelling you to use it and hold it at gunpoint.

That is a widely taught idea but it is not true.  
Money is imaginary.  Varying its price has nothing to do with real economy.  People, creating value for one another can be measured in any arbitrary way.  Altering the measure (ie the money) only distorts time preferences somewhat.  Keynesian and Monetarist Economics are prescriptive attempts over a phenomenon that defies prescription, ie Human Economy.  
Bitcoin is the most potent value transmitter ever devised.  It is a poor unit of account. Once its market cap exceeds that of gold, it will be an excellent, boring, low rate of return place to store value and excellent unit of account.  
The only way that "money" even becomes a factor in an economy is  when it enjoys an imposed monopoly, so that actors must express time preferences through the only lens they have, the distorted inflationary lens.  With a competitive currency environment, actors will choose the medium with the highest fidelity. Crypto has perfect transmission fidelity and again, will soon enough have excellent time value fidelity.   
The Economist article you cite uses very blunt notions like aggregate wages adjusting to deflation.  This is a terribly anachronistic notion.  It was probably always inadequate, but there is just too much variance in the world and no monolith of money anywhere for those to have any real meaning.

So who else thinks that a world with money free of third party filter is one that will fight and claw its way into existence leaving hierarchy in the dust of history? That eeking out a living in the commons of freedom is not how this will go, but quite the contrary, that court enforced legalities will be the minor way of doing things.  
Bitcoin is cheap.  The amount of fiat money in today's world is about $100T.  10^14.  As people globally become more productive through technology, education and direct one to one connection, the amount of money required will be far greater.   The current hierarchical money system is also very inefficient.  So it is not at all strange to imagine that the world may need about 10^15 or more of the spending power of today's USD.  
Blockchain money will take a big piece of that, perhaps the Lion's share.

Right. So if two sets of rules can each find consensus on separate chain branches of the Bitcoin chain, and they have enough price (!!) to persist, then they are both Bitcoin.  
If they share the Bitcoin genesis block and the owners keep control of the respective UTXOs, they are both some type of Bitcoin

No. Their respective markets/communities will call them Bitcoin.  They will find a new nomenclature.  Bitcoin X and Bitcoin Y.  They will each have the most work on their respective valid transaction chains.
They will both have continuous paths back to all Bitcoin coinbase emitted coins. The name doesn't mean much and no one owns it.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:40:59
You have it wrong.  I appreciate your sentiment.  We would all like to have Bitcoin find its place in the world as a useful mechanism of money.  But we are far from that.  And along the path, speculators and traders are good things.  Speculators support price, traders support liquidity.  Both reduce volatility.  
Bitcoin is very useless without a price.  
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:50:05
Well sure, but traditional money and finance can't even reach most people in the world today. 
You are fearing (or perhaps even advocating fear) of something that is not to be feared and is something to stand up against.  There is nothing objectionable about two parties exchanging whatever consideration they agree to in transaction.  There is nothing objectionable about Si chips, or the processing or communication of bits. Government banning peer to peer money is wrongful and there are only so much transgression states get to perform; they are highly overdrawn at this moment.  
There are standards of law in a functioning state.  A state loses legitimacy and thereby the prize of power if it does not somewhat properly enforce law.  If Bitcoin can not create some plausible deniability in its native state, there are cryptos that already do.
And for many, if the fiat fence tightens, then crypto becomes a means of survival.  Will you hop over the unenforceable fence to feed your family?   
If you think that there will be any opportunity to intervene in communicating bits, perhaps you might consider the relative costs and effectiveness of current state operations.  USA is impotent at war, surveillance, border security and policing.  Its cities and states are dying in increasing frequency as its federal state.  The business model of forcing fiat use is now in the open, if not widely seen as the primary ill in the world. The crucial element of mass propaganda has evaporated.  The function of the symbiosis of state violence and central bank fraud is replaced by an open source blockchain which we can actually trust.
  
You are saying that violence can be used to compel belief in fantasy (BIS bank ledgers) when the fantasy is already unveiled. Good luck with all of that.  Sure people under torture in the Inquisitions or in modern Sharia can be compelled to state they believe in some superstition, but they do not.  
There are limits to all power.
Pseudo code the law for me.  What behaviour can be banned with enough specificity to not be laughably unenforceable?  Encryption? Communication? Code? Keeping a copy of the blockchain? Cryptographic signature?

Right.  But its not decided by humans.  A hardfork with 100% success in terminating the legacy chain is certainly in consensus.  
So a hardfork that renders two branches one new and one legacy is in consensus on both chains, all the way back to the genesis block.
Edit: Of course overall it IS decided by human decisions, but it is a very binary decisive event, not decided as some measured opinion.

Interesting.  I always thought that the general idea was that a successful hard fork could claim legitimate heredity...
Personally, I don't mind too much the idea of a chain split (though I have a strong preference of which of them to own) and I don't worry too much about the name because I know they would both be called Bitcoin.  It is one thing to branch off a new altcoin with zero following and zero hashrate.  It's another to branch off with a majority of hashrate.

Oh you mean Satoshi has been doxxed?  Do you know that the person who developed the Monero (and like) protocol is also an un-doxxed anon?
The Bitcoin code doesn't really need modification even now.  
There are a thousand cryptos already released.  If these were somehow all state captured, a thousand more source codes would be released, many successively superior to Bitcoin.  Some would even be forks from the Bitcoin chain, so the progeny would be direct descendants.  You think law has the jurisdiction or the enforceability to halt this?  You think one little defensible island, let alone the entire Internet can't defeat that cheap cheap?  Do you know how expensive law enforcement is?  
Mining is already distributed.  If ASIC's become illegal (again jurisdiction and enforcement problems), then mining algos can go to general purpose chips.  
You are trying to say that law can be lawfully written and enforced that compels software developers everywhere to not do it.  No more information theory, no more digital comms, no more CPU's, no more software.  Too late.  You might as well make English illegal. No more reading and writing for you.  It is over already.  
Governments are not omniscient or ominpotent, nor should they be feared. Quite the contrary.  If we should find need for them at all (I think they aren't worth their costs), they should be meek, neutered, averagely paid and humble.  
Governments are people, not aliens or demigods. They are not superior in their judgement to you.  They have no right to say you can't speak or defend yourself, or reinvent money.  
So they face a ton of obstacles in your idea.  Can't and won't happen.
   
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:33:30
No.  
Bitcoin is a commodity with money like properties.  
We have existing mechanisms in traditional finance to trade derivatives of such things.  The trustless nature of the base commodity is paramount and is eroded by larger blocks.  
The current SW2X is a bit too risky IMO, but wheeee here we go. 
I would far far rather see partly trustful secondary layers for capacity.  Lightning is highly trust free, same for sidechains. Even if we end up with Bitcoin banks, trading Bitcoin derivatives, it is preferable to undermining the Bitcoin underlying commodity.  
The question is ill formed.  Trustlessness undermined by larger blocks should be undertaken in much more thoughtful steps.  Emergent Concensus is garbage.  SWSF is best, SWHF not terrible, SW2X is a bit scary but maybe fine, a one time 4MB increase is not a good path.  
SW2X will get Bitcoin's network to 1.5M on chain transactions per day, ample for the base level money.
