@_date: 2017-12-30 11:20:57
not to worry, the vision argument has become a really funny joke among my friends. i posted this to piss them off the other day 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:43:02
it was meant to be a joke :P
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:09:36


the graphic implies hodling though
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:02:00
rofl the fiat paft cracked me up
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:46:13
1 bitcoin!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:24:37
dont worry, because of chinese new years, wall street bonus and the upcoming fork, btc will moon for sure
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:57:11
can i ask you. how did you pick your password? im a wierdo on these things but i can remember all my passwords since 20 years? i have a system and references etc.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:23:03
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:40:17
how about now? &gt;D
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:18:08
i mean the fork
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:41:42
that didnt take long haha
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:35:38
its that time of the year again
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:53:38
do you need to have it in a exchange to get the b2x???
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:00:38
wp bro. wish u the best. (psst buy back in youre still early)
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:42:18
 comeback
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:21:40
allright thanks man. what is your advice for wallet?  i have about 0.5 btc
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:26:00
i mean. re enact everything
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:23:35
you know its still in there. try doing the same procedure in the same enviroment. ive used this technique to remember stuff. the smell of where you sat is a powerful thing
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:02:54
pretend its the same day. have the same breakfast from the same place. wear the same type of clother or better the clothes u used when coming up with the password. do the whole process asidentical as possible but plan it so u dont think about it just let it act out. things like a smell, a face, how the coffee tasted are each often capable of putting your mind into the same mindset causing it to do the same choices but you wont have to because when one of the trivggers hits u remember it just like that. please inform me after youve done it :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:12:48
i think hes not saying that much wrong? Hes a traditional finance guy analyzing btc as he would analyze anything else. why are everyone calling him a retard?
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:19:11
even with the tradeblock?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:05:11
add: guaranteed to be able to cash out oslt. for gold high for fiat moderat, bitcoin low?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:54:42
have a look lol. its what people do when they are bored with the game. lots of funny stuff but id like to take btc a tad more serious
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:25:13
the mind usually comes up with the same stuff when trying to do something random
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:56:54
my coins ARE in core. so im good? how do i claim the gold?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:04:04
winning? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:46:26
hehe turned out to be a good idea
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:14:54
i would know seeing quite a few shoops in my life
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:58:47
i actually BURSTED in laughter in public here spilling my beer wp gg no re xD
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:27:39
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:54:38
8k next
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:52:05
many of mye friends say the same,butwhen i ask, ok so you wouldve bought all those bitcoins if it werent for SR? then we laugh
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:46:41
timing was really good on this one. to bad it was only 500, but my totasl btc is fortunately bigger :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:25:19
go into detail!
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:23:48
so anything other than core, and i will get gtc gold for free? im asking where should i keep it that days. i dont wanna send them to coinbase
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:49:52
lol.yes the dollar has inflated, while btc deflated. so even if comprable, its the opposite. i would rather compare it to a house for example which someone sold for 10k usd back in the day but today the house is worth 100k. since what they did was basically "sell" their btc
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:26:56
thanks, that look forward is now a time travel into infinite future,
glad you didnt comb through your interactions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:19:33
are you sure about this? do you have any source?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:23:41
this is actually worse than . it makes me a bit worried that everyone left 4chan for r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:29:30
you think its a given that bitcoin will survive regardless? that is naive at best.
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:53:19
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:12:14
haha fair enough. if youre running a server it could make sense, or if they have a really shitty voip function oslt, but you can imagine how few would be able to connect if you needed to forward those ports to a single computer. if you dont manage the router, get a new dhcp lease, has a friend over. rant over but that shit is blasphemy for a network guy :P
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:28:26
why? it gives a new chance to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:05:15
i dont agree, it helps adaptation and acceptance 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:38:40
yes. like what do you think abiut this timing of purchase?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:33:50
its not ONE person...
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:38:10
wow thanks. i will order a hardware wallet before transferring all my assets
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:53:30
to me its been the excact same. i thought they made theire money on fees.
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:14:25
oh really? and what hat did you pull out this number from? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:58:13
govs cant ban something if the people dont agree. that is if we stand up for our rights
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:06:22
hahahha. i have manny friend that spent their btc on drugs then being salty now. but since they eouldnt have bought btc unless it was to spend on silkroad its no real loss anyway. and i ask them buy now them the chance is here again. oh mo lol not interested. looking forward to showing off my crypto fortuen in 5 years RemindMe! 5 years
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:48:02
everyone hates bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:27:23
it was a "dip" around the 23rd. i bought more :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:13:20
Since bitcoins are round they fit perfectly in the holes on the moon. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:16:08
i have downloaded the bitcoin core wallet and made a successful 10$ test transfer. so your advice is move all my assets? i believe in the software wallet more than hardware wallet tbh. i work with IT and virtualization is safer than hardware appliances imo. or am i missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:57:18
of course i did. and i sold all my eth and went btc. also sold all my ltc for btc recently. i think only btc will last the long run even if its possible to cash faster by going in and out of shitcoints
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:07:39
its not about if they could, if its we would let them
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:46:53
i want the best solution regardless of bankroll. who knows what the coins might be worth in the future anyway. but isnt bitcoin core more secure than electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:03:23
had all 3. sold eth and ltc to buy btc after thinking through what is the only possible positive outcome. bought more on the 15/9. couldnt be happier :))
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:53:31
its a start. and we gotta start somewhere. instead of the shop exhanging for dollars why not pay the staff directly in btc? n
then things are starting to get moving :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:17:53
its been talk about a global currency for a long ass time. every thinker is against it. now excactly that has been released under a pseudonym. what if its more calculated than we like to believe. who sits on the most of the btcs? nobody knows
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:02:54
you mean, invest as much as i can afford not to spend until i cant hodl anymore?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:28:48
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:26:12
but your advise is still a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:33:41
congrats to you :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:59:55
fuck altcoins. learned my lesson trying to gain faster. only reason i have money to trade is because the workhorse btc
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:15:55
im trying to get to 1, im at 0.4 now :) i wanna be part of 21 million club too!
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:32:58
my best advice is re enact the whole thing. sit in the same place, the same time of day etc create the wallet. when you come t the same prompt you might get the memory back or make the same choice :)
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:32:13
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:37:07
thats the same
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:21:57
why is a hardware appliance safer than a software wallet with a crazy long encryption key? given that my pc is not hacked/keylogged? what happens if the hardware fails/firmware is corrupted?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:56:18
7k next boys
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:05:39
and lack support
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:36:54
i love the optimism, but what it seems some are failing to understand is that it  demands alot of effort and pieces falling into place. as a hodler i surely hope btc will be used more and more but i hope that it will have a use other than a speculative value soon :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:34:00
its my conclusion after all ove read. just my opinion...
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:22:51
that was probably it. didnt mean to sound so aggressive lol. in the old days upnp was more used and it made the fw open and forward traffic by request automatically from the pc but its mildly insecure :P 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:46:59
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:14:38
buy with bitcoin and refill what you wouldve used in dollars. easy as that...

@_date: 2017-10-19 20:41:45
why the hell would you open incoming connections for a game lol. a client should initiate the traffic. or do you open htts to your pc so reddit can connect to it too?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:01:13
what does fud mean?
i hear so much about the idiots on wall street wanting to invest, plus all the noobs reading the news now. this must surely drive the prices up? however i think its sad that BTC is now something that the capitalists invests in instead of being a currency to free the people from corporate banking. /rant
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:04:18
because you would get access to the new type of btc that is forked oslt? ive heard different stories now and im really confused. also for if i should use the original or exchange/get force exhanged to forked btc. please enlighten me thx
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:37:30
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:21:17
maybe its our fault, by having a bitcoin sub we red it
