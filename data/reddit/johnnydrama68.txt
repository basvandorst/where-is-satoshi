Nope, by law a mortgage payment due on the 1st is not late until.the 16th of the month. Doesnt matter who your lender is.
Just a tidbit.

Haha I wasn't nitpicking I was just sharing a bit of info that many people aren't aware of. Wasn't disputing your point

My only issue with that method is you are losing a huge ROI by selling what you have and buying back in at higher price points. That initial purchase  will increase exponentially faster than buying back in at 18-20k.
Use the new job to finance Xmas, even if you take a small loan to accomplish it.
Best of wishes for your mom.

Originally credit unions had a lot of requirements to join but they ahave been relaxed to say the least over the years.
You can walk into any credit union around me and just open an account with no prerequisites.

So I looked back and the original 120 I spent on my first silk road purchase would be 1575 today.
Expensive trip but I had fun.

So in theory it doesn't need to be bitcoin. Something could replace it as long as it follows a similar protocol.

I hadn't considered it's advantages for businesses the way you described. Very exciting in theory and I guess this really could be the dawn of a new monetary system.
Lilke I said, I like the concept , I even bought into bitcoin so we will see how this plays out.
