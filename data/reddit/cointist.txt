This was the idea behind changetip. This is how you rope them in. It's a shame changetip died.

Appreciate all the details especially about cashing out. One reason the price is so high is because governments make it hard to cash out.

People usually use a payment processor who takes btc and pays the merchant in fiat. The processor bears the exchange rate risk. Examples are coinbase and coinpayments.net. there is another one bitpay but they've gone downhill in recent months.

Use a software wallet not a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:23:37
Just follow the installation instructions on electrum.org/ . In other words you just run `sudo pip2 install &lt;tarball&gt;` and pip will upgrade you. You should write down the seed mnemonic before doing an upgrade just in case something goes wrong. The wallet files are stored separately in ur home dir and will be upgraded automatically.

That software is a fork of electrum by another developer. It is not maintained by the electrum devs. It's called electron cash not electrum cash.

That post also says no web wallets and then recommends green address which is a web wallet. I question the quality of the advice in that post.

Bullcrap. Only your node counts. Other nodes cannot be trusted.

Those who interacted with him believe that, yes.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:22:57
You are asked to Verify the seed during wallet creation. You just have to be prepared before you create a wallet. have a notebook or piece of paper handy to write down the seed.

Miners may also choose to hodl when the price is really low (not right now). Someone called this the greatest decentralized market for Bitcoins.
The controlled supply of Bitcoin is an important read for anyone investing in btc

See the reasons why electrum uses a different seed mnemonic standard: 
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:29:47
Electrum makes good use of the version number that it encodes in the seed mnemonic. It supports many different wallet types so that matters. With segwit it's even more wallet types now. You wouldn't believe how many users have no idea what their wallet type is. The fact that they can restore with just the seed makes a huge difference.

They say web wallet not nya supporters so forgive me if I misunderstood. The post isn't well written if it can't get its point across without making us read between the lines.

IMO That hasn't really been tested yet. ~~In reality even with the bch fork (which did have replay protection) we had problems where people were connected to bch servers and the software didn't warn them.we only learned when they complained about their balances not updating.~~

You shouldn't have invested in Bitcoin if u don't care about the technology. number one rule of any investment is to understand what you are putting your money into.
