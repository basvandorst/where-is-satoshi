Wouldn't btc derivatives and etfs act as pseudo inflationary threats? these instruments claim to own underlying assets in a certain ratio to how much of the derivative you own but when you do the math it doesn't match btc real price. really not ideal for btc's future

exactly... and you'd have to do that on every exchange. so multiply 1 million$ by like an absurd amount lol

if you didn't write down a seed for the authenticator you'll need to contact coinbase support i think. I don't remember exactly but I think you may be able just to re-authorize the new phone once you are inside coinbase, but I know bittrex doesn't offer this. This is why I've been migrating to Authy, they provide a seed for your entire library of accounts. you can use Authy with every service that uses google authenticator

Chill out there mr. big mouth. If you look at cryptowatch it will tell you. choose your exchange and hover your mouse over the order on the order books. it will tell you how much BTC needs to be bought or sold to move the price to the selected order amount. currently it would cost about $950,000-1.2mil to move the price 100 up on gemini. you'd eat up a pretty big sell wall along the way causing more buy orders to come into play so it's probably not accurate and the number would become a lot higher and your orders may not fill along the way
