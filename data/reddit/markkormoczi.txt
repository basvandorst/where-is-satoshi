Breaking news! Bitcoin may soon hit 8k! Or 9k. Or 6k. Or literally anything.

Yes, in my uni there is a whole course, but even in mine blockchain, technology itself is included.

I don’t think I’ll ever sell it. I’d rather wait for a time I could use it as a currency. This summer I’ll go on a trip to Tokyo so hopefully there more shops will accept it than in Hungary (which is almost 0)

To be honest I haven’t heard the name Hanyecz here. Maybe his mother is Hungarian. On the other hand “ny” is very unique to Hungarian so don’t know.

Just saw it yesterday! And it’s not only in Shibuya. I see “BTC Accepted here” all over Akiba too!

I’ve yet to make my first purchase but I can’t wait! So much better than exchanging currency with a huge fee only to exchange back the leftover!

I've seen ads in Budapest's underground too! ( I know it wasn't about Budapest, just it's so amazing how BTC is going mainstream in Eastern/Central EU! )

I’ll visit Tokyo this summer and can’t wait to use BTC. In my country no one accepts it so it will be an exiting experience!

Both in Japanese and Hungarian names are written like this. So if you want to follow the Japanese order, his name would be Nakamoto Satoshi
