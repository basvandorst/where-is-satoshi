I was more talking about the fact that Tether and bitfinex cooperate. And Tether
Is printing 100 mio Tether coins (USDT) every day and then they buy bitcoin and co with it (through bitfinex and 2-3 other

Why exactly? Thought next futures will expire in February?!

When you check  and take a look at the pie charts, then you can see how huge USDT (Tether) and Bitfinex is involved in the current Bitcoin volume/price. Now imagine they are gone =&gt; we would get a huge crash. And of course we shouldn't forget the other bitcoins they have and maybe would sell because the price could drop too deep. Add the media and panic sellers here and you know why I'm a kind of scared. But thats just my imagination. Maybe I'm totally wrong. I just like to read other opinons, thats why I'm here.

Google: Tether and bitfinex. There could be your answer.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:32
Pretty sure it’s not because of some news people see on tv.
Could imagine some banks or even the government playing a game for years now. And it gets bigger and bigger.

Isn't that money laundering in a huge case? They print/create tokens with a value of 1$ each. They actually don't have the money but they still doing it. It's like you would create 100mio dmar198 token each day (and the value is 100mio USD) and then you are buying bitcoins (and other crypto) from it. And that every day. One day you get caught / busted and the exchanges they helped you as well. The other szenario is that you pumped money into the market that doesnt exist. If I buy 1 bitcoin then I send fiat money (right now about 12.000 USD ) to my exchange. So the market gets actually real fiat money. What they do is just pressing a button, printing 12.000 USDT (Tether) and can get the bitcoin (for free).
Correct me if I'm wrong. I really don't want to spread negative vibes. I'm really just curious to understand all this. Because in my eyes it's a huge problem since they owning already tons of bitcoins (and other cryptos).
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:36:47
You can actually Analyse coins by volume and follow the transactions. So when I can see how tons of Tether goes into btc (or in eos a couple days ago) for example, and the price directly grows about 5-15% then it’s something wrong. And when you Analyse a coin and you see, that for example 20% of Eos is built up with Tether then it’s scary too. That’s my opinion.

I wouldn’t call it FUD, as long as they can’t prove that they own all this money. And come on: I don’t want to be rude but a picture with a guy who saw the money...
Seriously?! 
Just google bitfinex / Tether. You will find your answer. Everybody should create his own opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:50:55
I love bitcoin. But serious what proof do you need? The last picture from Tether was a proof enough. Seriously instead of bringing any way to show that they really own the money, they upload a picture with a guy who said “I saw the money, I can proof it’s real”.
I mean you can track the printed usdt from the moment they get printed until the moment they arrive the same wallets every time again and again. You can find fake contracts and deleted statements from Tether, you can find earlier law cases against Tether and bitfinex etc. You can really find a lot if you just do a 5min research. So what kind of proof do we need here? Take a look by yourself. Try the twitter account “bitfinexed” or check the subreddit here on Reddit. But
Seriously, as long as I hear stories against Tether and don’t get any proof from Tether I will be aware and critical. In the end everybody should get his own picture. And once again: I love bitcoin but I would tell everybody to stay away from Tether.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:48:24
No. The CEOs of Tether just print the USDT and claim that they own the money (the dollars). But they don’t prove it. That’s the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:26:29
Yup. The day will come and the last drops will feel like nothing. But I still don’t think that it will kill crypto. Would still be nice if that money laundry game will end as soon as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:32:08
Then USDT could be gone over night...
Then bitfinex could be gone over night...
Then bn which stuck in bitcoin and co could be gone over night...
Then the market could crash over night...
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:11:25
Take a look: 
Check the pie charts and then imagine "USDT" + "Bitfinex" are gone =&gt; it's a huge crash in my eyes. Add all the panic seller and the media of course and then the chaos we had a couple days ago will look like nothing.
But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:55:43
I will. But then I hope It will happen as fast as possible. I mean market manipulation is one thing but that seems to be a bn$ level with no borders right now.
ps: sorry for my english, I hope you guys can still follow me. And thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:41:05
thanks for the fast answer. I'm super nervous right now - that helps to calm down a bit. Definitely time for a ledger or something like that as soon as I can login again.
I already tried to contact the support but I couldnt find direct contact options. At least not right now (maybe I'm too unconcentrated for obviously reasons).
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:53
Just a short update: I found the support contact (thank you!) + got an answer with introduction how to solve that problem. But before I did, I finally got my authorize mail after 5-6h. In the end: all went good :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:06:09
Thank you so much guys!
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:25:15
I already checked the spam folder but thanks a lot. :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:25:45
Yes I'm definitely smarter now. Still no mail so lets knock on wood that it's really just a server issue.

In my eyes it depends on the upcoming regulations (if...):
A.) price will stay around 10k and the market is quiet more or less until eoy.
B.) Regulations went fine and a lot of new money is coming into the market then I could imagine a price around 70-100k.
C.) Regulations went wrong and we are back at 3-5k.
My bet is 70% b.) 25% a.) and 5% c.)
