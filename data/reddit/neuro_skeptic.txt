Yeah there's your problem... sure, own bitcoin, but don't rely on it.

This thread is a bit of a Circlejerk.
Come on, as if Bitcoin itself is perfect?
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:07:20
No, obviously not.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:41:57
This sub is so toxic, Syria is stockpiling it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 11:45:40
Bitcoin makes bitcoin seem unusable.
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:09:23
I'm glad Roger Ver was banned, but maybe some people in this thread should be banned too for stalking/doxxing...?
It's time to clean up this toxic swamp.
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:07:37
It's up *today*.
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:55:51
The number of potential bitcoins is infinite because the number of potential forks is infinite.
@_date: 2016-11-14 12:31:16
Exactly, so no one person can say "this is what bitcoin is about"!
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:25:08
You're no retard - because you don't own any bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:51:53


@_date: 2016-12-05 11:35:50
No, you're not.
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:54:57
No that's not what said. What said is that it's dumb to think that the price *must* double every four years.
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:01:53


Bitcoin's not fit for any important duty, not yet while it doesn't scale.
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:56:05
Someone made a misleading internet statement **involving Bitcoin** of all currencies?!
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:25:56


"If you don't buy into this scheme, you're an idiot."
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:35:01
No, but OP is.
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:29:59
But Bitcoin isn't "better" than fiat currencies. It's different but not better in an objective sense.
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:03:14
Bitcoin... the money of the future... you'll get your money at some point in the future!
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:02:01
"Bitcoin is so good that if it fails it will be because it became too good."
@_date: 2016-10-19 16:03:38


Is it more likely that 16 people 'don't get it' or that one person doesn't get it?
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:46:15
The only solution is a new coin. The damage has already been done. Bitcoin is tainted by ASIC.
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:28:26


But they can happen. That's the point. It may not have happened *yet* to Bitcoin but it could happen.
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:38:09
The whole community is responsible for MtGox. This guy just exploited the community's failings. Lock him up, but don't get self-righteous, you chose to use an exchange and you chose to use an untraceable currency.
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:16:39
But you're not and never will be immutable. In the future, if consensus decides to confiscate all my bitcoin, then that's what will happen.
You can say that this has never happened yet in bitcoin. But nothing can stop it happening if a consensus develops to do it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:02:57


So you'd be happy with a situation in which the miners were mining blocks that the nodes reject? How would that be a workable currency?
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:51:39
Well, it hasn't worked, and this event is proof.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:08:34
There's just one problem - it's still better than Core.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:37:55
Ethereum got away with it, but you are not the Ethereum community.
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:53:29
If Bitcoin splits and goes down like the Titanic, that guy with his sign goes down with it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:38:44
Vitalik did it and he was right to do it.
There... I said it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:01:30
OP is right, though.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:45:13
There's just one problem... he's winning.
And if BIP148 is the best alternative, it's not hard to see why.
