Visa makes a lot more in interest on accumulated debt than they lose on cash rewards they give out. Hypothetically, one could do the same thing with Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency in lieu of US dollars or some other fiat currency.

This would be considered a transfer, not a sale.

This was June or July of last year, before BTC had hit $3k for the first time.

Thanks for the response. On the app I see the ability to add wallets for various cryptocurrencies but I don’t see the ability to remove a wallet once it’s been added (in order to declutter, say if you added one accidentally that you no longer want to view). Is there currently a way to remove a wallet once it’s been added?
Also, some suggestions:
Add desktop/laptop accessibility
Add charts for cryptocurrency performance (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/annual)
Add fingerprint login option as alternative to PIN
Overall pretty good mobile app so far, good alternative to Coinbase with a much better selection of cryptos for purchase. Has potential to become a serious competitor to Coinbase, especially as you begin to implement other convenient features Coinbase has.

Do you offer 2 Factor Authentication?

10 best days. There’s going to be other good days as well, but they can’t all be top 10. And it’s 10/365, not 10/1460.
