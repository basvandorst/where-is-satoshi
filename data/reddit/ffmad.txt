it's good for Bitcoin. It will look like the good coin for media &amp; gvt when SDC will have the role of the evil coin :)
And it's clear that Shadow will never be mainstream

this was given by Smurf *himself* to reveal Proms schemes

I've made the new version of another top-domain bitcoin website : 
And for that I didn't asked for even 1/20 of $100k ...
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:17:17
Why do you want to get rid of a french speaking Bitcoin community? -_-
If we have placed our logo there it's for a reason.
We also helped the bitcoin space stay orange during the italian attack ...
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:22:57
just come to our slack to see if we're not real :  ...
Among the not real persons, you have many unreal bitcoiners like the Ledger's guys
But yes, we created our Reddit yesterday. We just didn't thought to make it before, as we already had slack + forum
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:02:08
yeah, CryptoFR can have an orange background, we don't mind.
The flag behind was made to make it easier to defend, but it's not a French community, it's a french speaking one.
ps: we have no relations with the french flag, and we fought to keep the orange area in bitcoin

Don't erase the CryptoFR logo, it's a bitcoin community -_-'
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:57:00
btw, please don't run over the CryptoFR logo ( as a french speaking cryptocurrency community, most of us are bitcoiners.
We are already helping build / rebuild the bitcoin logo.

We're making something great for the bitcoin community ... stay on tune :)
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:02:36
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE!!
We've fought to keep the orange of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:18:16
That's great for Rarepepes, it's one of the best community project on top of Bitcoin.
Way more than just a joke :)
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:38:48
WTF? I replaced a wrong pixel with the good one? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:01:48
Let's put some orange so that they gave up on the idea ^^
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:32:58
Perfect. Can you show what you want to get? (the lower limit)
nb: please remember people here to not attack our logo, if we have to defend it, we can't work on the bitcoin logo &amp; orange area
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:37:25
CryptoFR logo : 
CryptoFR is a french speaking cryptocurrency community. (+1100 people on 
We would be happy to work together to secure both the bitcoin logo and ours :)

@_date: 2017-04-09 19:36:15
and the rarepepewallet itself works better than the counterwallet ^^
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:37:24
it's faaaar better
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:42:28
nope, there is still a lot of room for Bitcoin logo. Couldn't you start with it ?
We helped secure the bitcoin area, that's quite nasty from the r/bitcoin community to try to remove our logo....
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:20:04
i think it was repainted because the orange also attacked the letters. We will now move to orange, but please keep the letters
@_date: 2015-04-15 09:37:26
For CryptoNote there is a View Key, for Shadow (SDC) there is a Scan Secret (same function), but it's based on Bitcoin.
The problem is only with Dash/Darkcoin type of coins
@_date: 2015-10-30 15:27:09
A little change make it looks way better :)
@_date: 2015-10-16 07:50:03
that's the biggest threat of a reputation system (like Bitcointalk accounts that are bought to sell scams)
