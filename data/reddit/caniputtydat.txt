Why should i argue with paid internet posters. You probably did not read the bitcointalk thread post otherwise you would either keep quiet or quit the pathetic employment.
It was a no deposit bonus in my email while i was in the hospital getting a diagnosis for a threatening illness named cancer or multiplis sklerose - unclear at this point in time.   
A little distraction at this time was very welcome as you maybe can understand if there is anything human left inside your soul.
Thanks for your time, youre welcome

If the public consent becomes that with every purchase using bitcoin youre at risk of a total loss unless you backcheck the sites offering product ors services i dont see how this would enable it to be accepted as global payment method for the mainstream.

ETF = pay fee to a third party - why are people so eager to pay a bank for something you can easily do on your own?

it has become the very symbol of everything it was supposed to stay up to. The people controlling the code are the powerbrokers - a very small elite who wants to become the worlds money elite, with the difference they act in their own interest and dont care about general population, not even about environment. Additionally most recently you attracted the very speculators who are so evil for holding the worlds stocks - its worse - there is a strong motivation to ignore every ethic for monetary gain - ive left the ship in 2014 partly for these reasons, but theres more, too much for a post. Its pure greed for monetary gain and power now.

Everybody can do research and make up an opinion, too bad those who read here will mostly have a conflict of interest due to monetary involement anyways - alone for that its pointless to get into a deeper discussion here.. Was more like an emotional unload, every part of it can be researched using popular search engines and platforms or observing the people involved, doesent take a rocket scientist. :)
