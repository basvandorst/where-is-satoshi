 doesn’t require account.

I think merchants will play big role, they will choose multi coin LIT Lightning, just because it will be easier for adoption. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:55:32
LIT is lightning network implementation and so is Bolt, I don't think there is a such thing as "the" lightning network.
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:59:28
Lightning Network is just a concept as described in white paper. 
Bolt and Lit are real world implementations, am I correct?
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:01:20
Well, I can use Bitcoin on LIT Lightning Network, it is designed for it, and that's what I'm planning to do.

Bye bye Shapeshift
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:18:20
I don't understand how this is relevant to discussion, what I'm saying that there are multiple implementations of Lightning Network...
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:17:26
iOS and Android

Shouldn’t it be called Bolt Network instead to avoid confusion, since multi-coin LIT is what Tadge Dryja, author of LN white paper is working on:

LITbox will be cheaper and much better for merchants since LIT is multi coin Lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:36:49
I think LIT Lightning will handle addresses better and will be overall easier to use than Bolt Network. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:30:31
I agree, there’s not LIT Lightning:
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:03:04
I think GPUs would be more decentralised for mining. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:52:43
Yes, LIT is multi-coin and atomic swaps, only segwit is required. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:02:44
LIT by specs is far better than bolt. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:31:47
I think LitBox will work in a different way, it's more about software. It will have one address (like a phone number) and then it will choose what protocol to use.

No, bch is definitely NOT real bitcoin. It was also Satoshi who wisely put cap to blocksize since there was spam on blockchain.
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:04:05
I don't understand, how can you say who needs original Lightning Network and Bolt is somehow better because it's currently most used? It's like someone claiming Bitcoin original whitepaper from Satoshi and claiming they are real Bitcoin.
I suggest you to read LN whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:22:05
From what I have studied, of course it will be compatible with Bitcoin, since it's being made by inventor of LN and follows the original vision.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:05:15
There’s no need for merchants to have Bolt Network, LIT Lightning can handle Bitcoin and other coins. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:08:59
Hmmm. Links to what? Here's some links:
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:55:59
Which one are you talking about? Bolt Network is being made by companies, while LIT Lightning is non-commercial open source made by MIT. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:36:24
I think it then would be more clear to call it Bolt Network, if it's not compatible with non-commercial Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:17:21
Bolt network is not interoperable. LIT Lightning works with multiple protocols. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:35:45
LitBox? yes it will. There's github for it.
