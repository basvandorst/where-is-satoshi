Might be time to get out of crypto. The saying "Even though it's down XX% this week/month it's up XX% this year" is getting old.  When it's down for the year then what will they say. "It's only down XX% over two years?"

I've been using navy federal. No issues at all. It's 100% big financial institutions trying to keep your money with them.

What currency exchanges use segwit?

What revenue? I'll be writing off my losses
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:54:11
I'm so sick of this narrative.  It was cool weekly and monthly. When it's down over a year then what? "Hey it's still up over the last two years?"
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:02:01
These guys are in it for the "tech"
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:31:38
You have to understand that 90% of the people in bitcoin that are I it for the "tech" are really just in it for the lambos
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:24:20
I'd prefer it if the type of people who overthrow my government aren't the type of people who use the saying "real talk."

He matters because OP wants him to still matter and be relevant by posting this shit.

You guys act like you can buy homes and cars in cold hard crypto. I know you're financing something through a bank.
@_date: 2018-08-27 12:50:44
Shit post. BTC transactions per second are nothing compared to what's currently In place. Dont get me wrong I'm bullish but this is a shit post.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:50:05
How much did it cost him to hold bitcoin during the last week?

That Lexus would depreciate slower than bitcoin though
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:39:32
Cringe. Shit post.
@_date: 2018-10-28 18:44:28
The network requires miners. What happens when the mining reward isnt profitable? Sky high transaction fees?

Soon they will be saying sell the dip, buy the crash.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:15:51
Oh I see. I usually use definitions for my words.
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:02:27
It's good to see the replies have gone from factual debate over the topic to personal attacks. Were getting closer.
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:36:26
Why do people say this. It has no merit. Hey everyone I have 1000 BTC and 200,000 dollars.
@_date: 2019-08-27 21:40:16
Are we just not going to talk about the bitcoin dominance being completely off.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:09:15
I'm so ready to be at 10K or less in October so we can finally stop referencing this picture. It's almost as if the crypto community has never heard of coincidents
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:46:54
Soon you wont be able to use the last ten years to justify the last two years. 6k imminent?
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:35:07
I'm so glad you dont work in the legal field.
@_date: 2018-06-24 23:26:46
I cant wait for six more months. So people can no longer say "bitcoin is still up a ton from a year ago." Maybe then it will finally sink in.
@_date: 2019-10-20 04:25:30
Shit post

I just do t get these posts. I'm a huge bitcoin supporter. Jamie dimon is on the record for saying bitcoin is a scam but blockchain technology has value. 
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:38:34
Fees are killing crypto. From exchanges to atms.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:05:03
You guys try so hard
@_date: 2019-12-26 06:52:03

Bad news drives the price down good news keeps it the same.  It's only going one way from here
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:22:40
I'm sure you've been saying that the last 10 thousand dollars. What about the next 10k?
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:18:52
I bought the 15k dip am I a pro like you now?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:49
Larger than 10k. Lol?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:15
Worse than 10k?
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:38:18
It's such a great store of value 
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:06:26
Yes come to bitcoin where we can cut your wealth by 70%!
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:36:24
How many different threads do I have to read about the past? How many times do I need to say past performance is not indicative of future performance?
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:28:51
Where are all the people that kept saying "well it may be down but it's still up for the year?"
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:10:44
So this is what it's come to
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:26
People said the same thing at 17k 14k 12k 10k and here we are again. Why buy at all. It's only going down from here
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:41:38

Why 5k. Appears to be going to 0 one month at a time.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:24
Some people just can't see the crash I suppose.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:36:01
Someone should tell this guy to look at the price. Its everything but bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:02:49
The "it always goes back up" mentality is very dangerous.
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:48:00
This guy is also probably "in it for the technology"
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:39:41
What people don't get is how easy it is to make something go from $10 to $20.  It's an entire other feat to make something go from 10000 to 20000. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:05:29
You guys are so high
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:43:58
Except now it's just down down down
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:45:47
I like bitcoin... a lot.... but this post is a huge lie. It's what bitcoin wants to be, not what it is.
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:45:56
Is this what counts as journalism? A 1 minute hate post with no research?
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:16:34
Those pic gets cringed to so hard. Does coincidence not exist in crypto. I cant wait for us to be 10k all year so we can stop using that pic.
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:00:58
I cant wait for another 5 months in December so your argument doesn't work anymore. But hey, you guys can always revert to "what about 2 years ago!!"
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:17:10
A few months ago a whole lot more people were in crypto. I understand segwit is helping but don't lie to yourself. There are less daily transactions.
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:22:01
"Early" you sir are delusional.
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:41:17
And what about the last 6 months? Yeah that's what I thought.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:31:23
Mic dropped. Math always, always wins.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:32:04
I think you meant cant pop again? Its popped dude.

Ready the memes
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:36:55
If it's not an investment it's useless. Bitcoin can serve its purpose at 1 dollar per btc.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:24:27
Bitcoin will not have any more scaling issues lol
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:33:47
Is it still cool to make people think you're fine with losing money?
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:16:34
And to sell high it needs to be high? Wow
