Remember when you said: "Damn, 20k? I wish I would have bought bitcoin months ago, when I first heard about it".
This will be you again, in a few months, if you don't buy the dip now.

You guys are idiots. If the dollar value would be dropping you guys would freak out too. The same way crypto owners freak out about bitcoin price  changes. Its ALWAYS about the money. If you cant admit that you're lying to yourself
