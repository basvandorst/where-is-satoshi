Too many people sat staring at minute charts, panicking every time they see a sell order pop up. Its on the rise, but If everyone just chilled TFO price would rise a lot faster! Invest, walk away, check on things in a couple weeks.

My creative choice, was to use, lots of commas, instead,,,,,

Even though everyone is panicking, the positive trend from where we broke out yesterday remains well intact. Just use your best judgement, we may retest 10k levels which could cause a further drop but I wouldn't count on it - this is still a bounce back from yesterday. The slightly less risky approach is to divide your capital into X equal lots, then buy X amount at each occurrence of some set time interval. The only way you're gonna hit in on the head and go all in right at bottom is pure luck, or a crystal ball :)

Thank you! We're still well positive from yesterday, going from 10k to 16k in a day - although it would be nice, that isn't exactly sustainable growth!

Haha, Putin's pretty much a dictator at this point.. I predict a poor outcome for this guy lol. Good on him for having the balls to even run though..

Everyone needs to calm down! We broke out at 10.4k yesterday (gdax), and positive trend since that point remains intact. 
Think of it like this; we break out, FOMO carries the price to 16k a bit too quickly.. people then start to think 'hang on, not too keen on these prices a few hours after 10k'. The market stalls and corrects again, and as long as we dont revisit 10k.. the process will continue with an overall positive trend. That's pretty healthy growth overall, in the volatile world of crypto!
Imagine if we had gone from 10k to 20k yesterday, that would never have been sustainable! and we would've seen a massive correction in proportion to that rise as people cashed in their gains. 
(Not saying it wont go below 10k, no crystal ball.. conclusions just  based off logic and previous market behaviour)

Haha, you guys are nuts. Make profits, spend profits, enjoy life. Hoarding endlessly so you die with a large bank balance.. or end up with shit all to show for it, fuck that.

Money makes money, really no surprises there. Hopefully their greed will make them push bitcoin further - resulting in a gain for the average joe.

At the moment, its just a dip followed by recovery like any other. Anything more than that is just speculation. According to that logic, every time an ATH has occurred, followed by correction.. it is following a bubble chart exactly, which means you could've said that a bunch of times in the past also, and been wrong. But never say never lol.

What bitcoin needs is for a group of the elite to join up and do have a couple of TV ad's made, explaining why panic selling is pointless.

Mate, zoom out of your minute chart.. try 6hr. We're still in positive recovery from yesterday. When a market jumps from 10k-16k in a day, its perfectly normal for it to be followed by a correction.
