I'm in NZ, bought 10 Bitcoins for $1 each using coinpal, which has since shut down because their paypal account was frozen.
Sold them later for $4 each by turning them into Liberty Reserve, then transferring them to exchange zone and selling them for paypal money directly to another person.
Tried to buy some more a few weeks ago but it's very difficult now if you're not in the USA/Europe.

If you invested $120, just leave it, regardless of market and see what happens. Don't be that guy who sells for 300% profit, then 2 years later could have sold for 5000% profit if he'd held on. $120 is nothing.

Lol.  Why does anyone believe MtGox is safe or trusted? It's already been hacked once. Have you all forgotten that MtGox lost thousands of peoples wallets?

Wow. Bitcoin just dropped $4 in 10 seconds.  Now at $66. 
personally I'd love to buy cheap bitcoins, I just can't find an easy way to do it. 
EDIT: annnd someone just bought 2k coins, price back up to $70. Damn... So volatile at the moment.

Hilarious. The media is so many steps behind technology.

Hehe. Fair enough. I think the main fact to consider is even with all this publicity, bitcoin is STILL yet to truly hit mainstream. When the average person on the street knows what bitcoin is and wants in on it, I expect the price will go well over $500 a coin.

Someone who runs MTGOX decided they wanted to sell off their BTC, so they did, then tried to make it look like it was 3 hours ago, and not 3 minutes ago.

Try mining litecoins. You'll find it easier now.

I anticipated this. It's just all the value that increased with media attention/speculation that's dropping. They will level out soon then be back up to $250 in less than a week.

Sure, buy for a few hundred, why not risk it? You wouldn't be losing much in a worst case scenario.

Bitcoin will never crash to $0, unless it becomes possible to decrypt it/find a security flaw. 
Drug addicts will still need their drugs from silkroad, and bitcoin is the only accepted currency. As long as silkroad exists, bitcoins will not be valueless.

I would love to spend $100 on printing pamphlets and flyers about Bitcoin and its advantages to hand out around my local community! 
I live in New Zealand, and even with all the recent media, nobody I talk to in my community has even heard about Bitcoin yet! 
It would be awesome to get local businesses in my town involved and interested, especially the local farmers market! 
I think that with a little work, and a little funding, I could help the community come closer together, through Bitcoin.
