Username delivers. Thanks.

Yes. It is more. Far more. 
They are 2010 purchasers who sat on it all until they recently heard news of the gains to be had.

It's genuine, and that was one of my recommendations as all. Thanks for the post!

It's true, actually, but well played!
If you're technogically inclined, people assume you know it all. I admitted I do not at the start. 
EDIT: grammar is hard apparently.

You've never been asked to help someone clueless before?

This is a great idea, thanks! I'll see if they are interested. 
I'm not privy on nuances of BTC so thanks for the tip. 
I told them values are likely to increase, but sounds like they're not too concerned because the amount they have now is worth more than enough to please them.

Last year, I sold at the ATH and paid for my wedding on the 22nd of December and a home. 
For those still in the trenches...god speed, and good luck.

Hence the ? 
I pulled out and never looked back. (there's a joke in that sentence somewhere)

Correct! I hadn't yet! I was still renting a small apartment in a university town. My small savings was my personal savings - I was initially going to surprise my wife by buying the house without touching joint savings. And I never said the house was entirely purchased on BTC. But I will say a very large amount was paid from crypto earnings. All investments we make land in our joint account and we each have separate accounts as well. :)
Cute how everyone wants to try to pick a fight as if they know my personal details...
And yes. Taxes are paid. Thanks for looking out though!
Anyone else want to try to doubt it? Do I need to send you a picture of my house for fucks sake? 
People gotta get them big e-peens out apparently...
Again. I have zero requirement to have anyone believe me. I shared my experience. Otherwise, I'm done with this thread. 
Again. Best of luck to anyone still HODL-ing! I only hope for the best!

A) why would I lie? That seems like a really stupid and tedious thing to lie about. 
B) that's cool, I don't need your belief. I have my house and my wedding was essentially free. 
Best of luck!

Hell yeah. Really glad I pulled when I did. I would not be happy about the current state. I profited by a huge margin because I sold when I felt it peaked. (Bought in at 3k. Sold when I think it was around 21k(?) on coinbase)
I know HODL is life. But hey, I'm happy with my choice!
