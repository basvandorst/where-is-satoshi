I'm kicking myself for selling 10 000 BTC for 20 USD more about a year ago.

Pseudonymous maybe?
I guess security refers to the actual transaction process being secure. It's like HTTPS. If you have a keylogger installed or something you are screwed, but HTTPS is still secure.
It will always be fast as long as there is **someone** using it blocks will always be "processed" (actually, they are processed instantly) in ten minutes. No matter how many users there are exactly.
I don't think global does mean how many users there are and there are users in a lot of countries. At least on all continents.

There are just a bunch of people who want to make some money (buying cheap Bitcoins) and the only place where sane people believe it crashes is the Bitcoins Forum. It's based on a suggestion that has been made some time ago: Lowering weighted prices by throwing some cheap Bitcoins on the market and creating "SELL!" forum threads. It worked quite well and lots of people are able to buy cheap Bitcoins. So if you want to join the fun it's the right time. The current BTC is very low and all those people not understanding the whole situation will either learn or leave.

There is a difference between failing and not being there yet. It's like we'd be in the in 1985 and you'd write an article "Why the internet failed on it's way to become a new media for the masses"

I just posted it because I think it looks professional, which is something a lot of persons care about, before they start using a product. So I think this videos like this could actually attract people to Bitcoin, which is nice if you want the market to grow.
But you are right about the marketing bullshit. Tat's why I put the "advertisement" into the title.

I think it's the right time. Some time ago everyone here screamed about the Euro dying. I should invest in gold and CHF. Maybe it's better to trust BTC, than USD or EUR.
