I’m new to this. So if I get a Nano, how does this work? Do I buy from Coinbase and then send to nano? I don’t get it.

We have 9 houses closing this week. It’s slower compared to what the spring/summer market is.

I think the use of this will also help those of us who got in now/before.

Let's say, hypothetically, I want to buy when the price drops to 11K. What would my parameters be for a buy stop order? I'm confused with the numbers on a buy stop order and I want to be certain on how to do this on a dip. I know this is not the most traditional use of a buy stop order. 
Would I put Stop Price at $11,000 and my Limit Price like $9,000 because I'm willing to buy at any price below 11K? Or would it be something like Stop Price $11,000 and Limit price 11,200 because I'm willing to buy over 11k if the market is fluctuating so fast. 
The reason behind all this is I'll be out of country with unlikely internet use and want to cover my bases if there's a huge dip.

I got in at $9,200 with around .05 BTC. I plan on buying $200 a week when I feel it’s a good buy in.

If there’s a massive dip I’m panic buying more than I probably should. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:37:02
$200 a week with the best buy in at that week. Unfortunately I can’t dish out a bunch all at once.

That’s what I am trying to do. I’ll just auto buy on Coinbase and do what you mentioned. 
I also have a Christmas bonus coming up that will be a few thousand. I was just going to pop that into my savings and I’m contemplating just dumping it into BTC.

Real estate. Slower time of the year so there’s not a whole lot to do constantly.

Going to DFW tomorrow!

Exactly. I want to start using it as a savings account. Like I mentioned before, $200 a week is what I would be saving in my bank account but interest rates are so low that it’s just parked there doing nothing. I have a good amount of savings but I’m still new to this and don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket.

I have a similar situation. A week later they emailed saying some shit like they’re having a hard time getting back to me due to the large volume of support requests. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:44:32
Well this helps a lot thanks man!

My entire office has barely worked today (including boss) because we're all glued to our gdax screens.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:27
Still says this for me too. Annoying. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:31:28
It just went through for me. I would check again!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:13:24
I'm actually doing fine, thank you.
