Reached "don't give a fuck" a few years ago. Other people I know who hold BTC try to get me to panic. All I can do is shrug.

Cool. You just got recruited for the illustrious job of ... Money laundering! Probably for a drug cartel!
They used to recruit people to do this by receiving things like computers and TVs and shipping them to other people. People would do it because they got to keep some of the stuff and some of the money. In reality they were just funneling money through their bank account to the "partners", and getting shipped stolen goods.
With crypto, people's eyes light up even more and it's even more untraceble. But when push comes to shove it's you that will be burned and tossed to the authorities.
Sure, expect money to be wired to you. Then it gets filtered through this "business bitcoin wallet" to their "partners", and hey look, the bank trail is interrupted. (Pointing straight at you as the last link.)
They get your bank account info too as an added perk and will likely drain that as well.
Run, do not walk, run away from this situation. Don't explain anything to them, just ignore anything further and do not take a single fraction of money, crypto or otherwise, from them.
Unless you already have, in which case.. you have a lot of work to do here, in contacting law enforcement and changing your bank accounts.

I mined all my shit in '13, what me worry? My regrets are earlier sells at like 2k, just wish I had 10x the BTC I have now. 
That said I know a lot of people decided to try to jump in on this train but -- from folks who have been around the block with this ... this is ABSOLUTELY NOT "Certain doom" for your investment. No way no how.  I can't predict the future but it certainly isn't assured doom. If this goes real low I'm going to make up for missing out earlier.

Can you explain a bit more what you mean by "I forget the address is not changed from before" -- 
You need to give more details here. We can't confirm what's happening unless you tell us, for example, where you're buying the BTC from - such as when you say "the website" and what do you mean by "the address"..  What website? What address from 'before'? What is 'the address' -- The address for your wallet?  Which wallet? And what what do you mean by "mining, etc."
Fill us in on some specifics and maybe someone can help...

One thing I haven't heard addressed yet: What about people who had already-exchanged fiat in their accounts? 
I assume that's all gone too, even though it wasn't "stolen" by the "hack"?

"Rivalries" don't become nearly as nasty as the BTC/DOGE thing has become.  You claim to 'only have dogecoins' but you've essentially just been called a paste-eating retard.  If you think that's hilarious, you're probably also doubting your judgment calls on crypto.
Did you just think about dumping your DOGE? Then, the OP and the comic has done its job.
Fun and hilarious indeed.

Similar here, USD but, significant amount.  I hear all the 'lectures' about keeping coins in an exchange - that's great and all, but with how slow Gox was on withdrawals, there wasn't a whole lot some folks could have done to be more prudent.
Also, fiat can't really be written off as "well, virtual currency may lose value." - At that point it had been converted, Gox just didn't pay.  So to me that feels like a different animal... 
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:28:18
Yep, and I agree with you and fully feel that both coins can coexist. (Fun fact: They are coexisting, right now.) I do feel dogecoin and bitcoin can and do serve two completely different purposes, but there are people who think that Dogecoin is some kind of 'shadow government plan to belittle Bitcoin'.  To which I say, okay, a little too much Coast to Coast AM and abovetopsecret dot com there but, eh, whatever floats their boats.
But you and I are probably about to get ripped to shreds for posting in here; the lions just haven't smelled blood yet.  I try to stay out of other people's subs for that reason. But, this got crossposted, so it was a little bit invitational and confrontational.
I never really understood the joy of schadenfreude and the appeal of being an asshole to strangers on the internet just because you can - and I wish some people would explain its merits to me - but just because I can't understand it doesn't mean isn't incredibly popular.

I'd hope that that's the case, actually, because that makes for a rational argument other than "we've just got a whole lot of sociopaths out there".  I hope you're right.

I'm a shibe, .  So no, I don't hate you, but I also know what time it is. 
None of this is meant as "fun".  
It's a thunderdome/highlander attitude, and while it's completely unnecessary, fooling yourself into thinking it's just a friendly jab is unfortunately not the case.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:37:58
That'd be "lack of accountability", yup, I agree with you there. Still don't see the fun in it, but yes, that's the enabling factor for sure.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:12:10
Probably not. People love to crush eachother with incivility, and on the internet you can do it with impunity.  I agree with you, (upvoted) but fat chance of it ever happening.  Highlander/ThereCanBeOnlyOne/ToTheDeath etc blah blah blah.
@_date: 2014-06-06 06:10:03
Yes, it is malicious. We get it, Bitcoiners hate shibes.  Point driven home, dead horse well beaten.
Bitcoiners hate Shibes with a bloody passion. Got it. Next?

They're continuing to "have fun" with their victims because it works.  GUARANTEED, that MANY of the people who got ripped off will jump right back in and buy "Generation 2 Magical Snow Power" miners.
"Queen Elsa" probably has a legion of fans at this point.
Yes, that's right -- people who just got ripped off by Hashie are about to give them even more money.
Freaking bizarre.... 
Aaand yep, here come the posts like this one:  [I LOVE HASHIE!](

I always felt nervous about LastPass and its cloudishness along with a "We can't peek, honest! Fingers crossed!" 
I use KeePass and manage my own database file for it.  I think it's highly probable that LastPass doesn't have any way to look in at what they keep on their servers, but there's no way to be sure.
