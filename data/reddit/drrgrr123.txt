Just ignore. This guy is a troll or just unlucky when he thinks. He bought at 20k, came back and whined for a few weeks that the 4 year cycle wasn't over in 2 years and then found some magic powers when he predicted further down moves in the current down trend.

People just get fed up with hearing the same negative things over and over. It's not constructive and you don't bring anything new to the discussion. Sorry that you bought at 19k but there is not much to do. Put it in a cold storage and forget about it for a while.

How is it that price can follow so effortlessly between different exchanges? If someone sells 5k btc on binance someone will sell a similar amount and get BTC to the same price on coinbase pretty much the very same second.

It won't matter it the sense that you still make money, but.. Buying for $10k at 9k gives you 1.111btc, at 12k 0.833.
  
At100k that would be a difference of almost $28k in profits.

@_date: 2019-07-24 21:48:35
Of course you are but there is a reason that you are getting down voted. 
It mainly because of how you word your guesses. 
I follow lots of people that give price predictions, but they have a few things in common. Either they are professional traders with a track record or quoting sources that make their guesses based on TA or news withing the crypto market. All of them are very open about how no one knows what will happen. 
You take your numbers from a gut feeling, but call them accurate and helpful. People put their hard earned money in to crypto. You are reckless and dangerous to the space. You should be much more careful with your wording. Guesses only go so far. The reason that you don't put your money where your mouth is is that you would get rekt in the long run and you know it.

Why would anyone trust you when you don't even follow your own predictions? At least put in a 1X short. Everything else means that you even know your self that you are full of shit.
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:51:57
Ok. Let's take this one then. Now we wait.
"we are going to go down to $8k in the next 2-4 weeks (probably will be about 2 weeks)
then it will stay at around $8k for about a year (during that year, there will be brief lows into the low 6Ks and brief spikes in the high 9Ks - but all in all, it will hover around $8K).
but no, it will never go to $5K
after a year at around $8K, it will slowly start to climb back up ...in the later half of 2020"
Edit: so for you to be right:
8k within 2-4 weeks (before end of august?)
Stay between 6000-9999 for about a year.
Not reach 5k.
Above 10k after 1/2 of 2020.

To clearify. My quote is you a few days ago talking about your crypto business on a public forum.
You invested at ATH, waited 18 months of a 4 year cycle, came here to spread negativity for a few days over how we are not yet at a new ATH in the beginning of a new bull market and are now giving financial advice. Don't do that.

2-3 days normally. Fyi there might be a fee from your bank for the bank transfers. For me it's about 3€ so for buys below 100€ it doesn't really make a big difference but if you make a bigger transfer it will be a much better option.

412.10 BTC were bought buy people wanting to trade fiat money for Bitcoin and 253.89 sold by people who wanted fiat money for their Bitcoin. There is always someone on the other side of the transaction so there is a buyer for every sell and a seller for every buy. This is about who triggeres the transaction and that determines if the price will go up or down.

@_date: 2019-10-12 15:06:53
I have a few guesses;
  
Stock markets are closed over the weekends. This spills over to the crypto market as well since many traders are trading both.
  
The low volume keeps big players away. If you want to sell or buy a large amount, a thicker orderbook is on your side so the price doesn't drop as fast when selling or rise as fast when buying.

There are buy and sell orders waiting at the exchanges. Let's say the price is at $8000 right now. Then I can put in a order to sell if the price reaches 8100 or to buy at 7900, for example. That is the orderbook.
  
If I want to sell 100 Bitcoin now it will have to fill orders already there, so it will eat up the orders downward. First one might sell for 8000 but to find a buyer for the next 99 coins the exchange will fill the orders downwards in the orderbook. That's why the price drops when people sell.
  
If I on the other hand want to buy 100 coins the first one might be at 8000, but then the exchange will look for coins for sale at higher prices in the orderbook to fill my order. That's why the price rises when people buy.
  
So the sell/buy difference is determined by who instigates the order, a buyer or seller.

There is no good answer to your question. The next ATH could, if to follow the pattern of the two previous halvings, come sometime after next summer.

Pretty much. You copy the address from the receiving wallet (it look like this: bc1q8hggrm0xy5hpvflhffjpeed3ejujgtttrvl8hdrk) and paste it in on coinbase. But do some research. There are some bad wallets that will be less safe than just keeping it on coinbase. If you have some money invested I would recommend buying a hardware wallet.

This has been going on for a long time. You learn some things and get free coins. If you want to you can convert them to BTC at no cost. What's wrong with this? I think I've got ~$100 from it so far.
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:35:20
It's like an email inbox that stores the keys that are your Bitcoin. You can send and receive Bitcoin from this address.
  
Some are online wallets. That's like Gmail. Your keys will be stored on a server belonging to the people behind the wallet. Not considered very safe since the owners of the server could take your Bitcoin if they want, the server could get hacked and every time you log in you have to send your password via internet to their server and that could be intercepted by someone wanting to take your coins.
  
You can also have a local wallet on your computer or smartphone. That's better but your phone or computer could get a virus that will log your password or something similar.
  
The best option is a hardware wallet. That is pretty much a USB flash drive where you send your Bitcoin and then disconnect from your computer. In that way there is no internet connection to the wallet and no one can access it. You can buy one like that for $50-200 depending on how fancy you want it. Only order directly from the manufacturer so that no one can have tinkered with it.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:48:09
Hardware wallets from Ledger or Trezor are usually what's recommended. Some people say that it's recommended for everything over $1000, but since you can get one for &lt;$70 I'd say it could just as well be the first thing you buy. Then you can rest easy.
Edit: Only buy directly from the manufacturer.

What is stored on the hardware wallet exactly? I thought it was the keys. But, if I send coins to my wallet address without connecting the hardware wallet to my computer I don't see how they can get there. I still assume the coins will be there. I'm confused and maybe stupid.

Bitcoin is a relatively new market and there is not so much money in it compared to other bigger assets. That means that a lesser amounts is needed to move the price compared to for example mainstream stocks or precious metals. On top of that the price from start was very low compared to now and has gone both up and down massively so some people today have very large amounts of Bitcoin.
  
This move could have been to the other side. Tomorrow it might. The bulls predict the price to rise a lot but it might take a few years.

There was an exchange in Norway that was hacked and couldn't recover their site. They gave all customers the USD amount of their Bitcoin calculated on a price several months earlier. E.g they payed out ~5k per Bitcoin at a time when BTC was well above 10k. This could happen to Robinhood as well.

What I hear the most here is that everything above $1000 should be in a hardware wallet. If I would give my personal opinion I think people should buy one at the same time that they buy their first Satoshi, atleast if you plan on buying more or hodling for a long time.

If we hit the same market cap as gold we would have a ~$400.000 Bitcoin. That combined with more hype and alot of global inflation and it's possible. Maybe not likely but possible.

The market is relatively small and the order book not so thick.
