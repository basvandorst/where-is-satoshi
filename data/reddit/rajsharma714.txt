Ah, yes I understand now. My understanding of it originally was wrong until another user posted an image showing me the correct way.

This is what I did.  You can view the screenshot here. 
My total at the bottom is $3348.21. That doesn't make sense to me.  Can you/someone explain this to me?  To me, I read it as that I am willing to pay $7500 for 0.44642857 bitcoin.  Is this correct or am I wrong?

It does that for Coinbase, but not for GDAX.

$7500 total. I obviously will be getting &lt; 1 coin, I just rather not waste $100 fee spending $7500 on Coinbase.

Then how do I put in an order to purchase bitcoin on GDAX for $7500?  I understand I won't get a full coin, but the most I want to spend is $7500.  Can I do this with GDAX Buy Limit Order so I don't waste money on fees getting it through Coinbase.

I got it.  Thanks for the images.  I see what I was doing wrong.  I was putting in $7500 in the Limit Price instead of putting in the value of the coin to limit it at.  Thanks!

Can you help with what I would enter under Buy Limit for “Amount” and “Limit Price” for say $7500?  I assume I would enter $7500 in the Limit Price box, but what would I enter in the Amount box?  Thanks in advance.

Checked out the site. Unfortunately I don’t have  an EU bank account.

I think having banks block you from using debt cards to buy bitcoins is just plain a dick move. Credit cards, I understand. But debit card is verified funds available in your account that they would happily let you spend any where else. And using the excuse of “it’s so volatile” is not a good enough reason when Wall Street can be just as volatile. It should be as simple as “it’s your money, do what you want.”
