Every crypto has this property. What is your point?

Keep going, you're almost there. If you _never_ spend it, the price accelerates exponentailly toward infinity. And if _nobody_ ever spends any coins ever again? Singularity achieved.

Sorry, but that's dumbed down to the point of complete inaccuracy. To use lightning you have to lock your BTC into a channel. And each channel requires a separate commitment of BTC. There's opportunity cost for locking up any asset. Surely you recognize that. And then there's the issue of paying to have your transactions routed to parties other than the ones you've opened channels with.
That doesn't compare very favorably with simply converting the value you intend to spend to an alt with good liquidity. For example you could pay a one-time fee to convert so LTC and then you can spend it like cash without any of the encumbrances of the lightning machinery.

Wait, psychopathcoin is bitcoin? I'm confused. How does litecoin compare to bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:59:12
That's a helpful chart. You should add bitcoin to it.

No, I meant destroying the internet would destroy the US economy.

Not for the whole network, only for itself. 


Miners _are_ nodes. When there's disagreement as to which consensus rules to follow the nodes split and the chain forks. Your argument assumes that there's a correct and an incorrect version of the rules but you don't get to dictate that. There's just two versions, each of which is enforced by a subset of the pre-fork nodes. That's it.
I know it's tricky; bitcoin is a new invention and it takes a while to wrap one's head around it. But the thing is, if you or any other individual or group of individuals got to decree which is the real set of consensus rules then we'd be right back where we started and the bitcoin experiment would be a failure.

And the entire US economy with it. Not holding my breath.

I see insults are your stock in trade. So tedious. The assertion on the table is that there is a lot of crap to wade through in both subs. You have disputed this assertion and to support your argument you present...this. Well played.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:30:51
Nah you're good. Someone has an axe to grid apparently.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:29:48
No. More similar than different. Lots of boosterism. Lots of negativity. Low signal-to-noise ratio. Lots of shills, just shilling different sides of the coin.
Your comment here is a case in point actually. You can't really think insulting someone is going to bring anyone around to your point of view?

Spread your buys over a range

Kudos to you for asking the question. You should post the same thing on You’ll get very different answers but they’ll be biased too. The truth lies somewhere in the middle most likely.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:19:28
Plot twist: your grandfather gets rich on the BCH moon rocket. Meanwhile, "digital gold" reverses and craters when the realization dawns on all the noobs that its tiny transaction rate makes it unsuitable for real-world usage as a currency. Tragedy narrowly averted. Thanks Roger Ver!

There are lots of moderates on too. The extremists make the most noise but you're severely in error if you think that community can be uniformly characterized in any meaningful way.
It's pretty lame to dehumanize and belittle an entire group of people.


Oh wait, you wrote that.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:11:23
Yeah link or STFU. There are a number of valid criticisms which could be leveled at but censorship ain’t one of them.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:42:05
Yes, we're all the same. You can paint us with one big broad brush and not miss a detail.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:02:58
What an odd non sequitur. Nothing has "turned out" yet so I'm not sure how to even respond to that. Would you like me to stick my tongue out at you like a petulant child?
My point was, you're characterizing folks who post on (which includes me) as if they have homogeneous views and are incapable of holding a balanced or nuanced opinion. That's not accurate and it's not cool.
