You don't believe speculators would ride it up, driving more buys and sells into the market?
@_date: 2011-10-12 20:31:47
You should look at USD, EUR and GBP charts.

This system, on a mid end cpu, will only crank out about 300 watts.
I didn't downvote you, just thought you should know your math is wrong.

Go directly to the source. Find a miner like myself to sell you bitcoins. A lot of us will trade paypal gift transfers for BTC sent to your wallet or a MtGox code.
Post in r/bitmarket or r/bitcoinmining
The majority of us are trustworthy and would love to help more people get into bitcoin.

I agree, you shouldn't put that in quotes. Austrian economics and Keynesian economics and two separate economic *belief* systems. Neither are proven or disproven, as it is impossible to truly do so. Time has given Keynesian economics an advantage as it has been practiced for quite a long time, but has never proven stable. Austrian economics has never proven stable either but hasn't been practiced for nearly as long. Putting Austrian economics in quotes just fuels a fire for bad example.

That is all you'll get with this setup and the only way to make it even remotely profitable, Which it is not, is to keep lugging it in and unplugging it to conserve on home energy cost. My suggestion, don't depend on mining unless you want to build a profitable rig. Buy in if you want into BitCoin.

Agreed, .40 is pretty significant, unfortunatly .40-.50 seems to also be a sell point for many speculators

A 200 BTC trade is hardly damaging to the markets. 20,000 BTC could but, I doubt 100 small traders are off loading their bitcoin at once.

Why would you buy 5g of gold or silver? sure its easy to move, but if you sneeze you may lose it.

A lot of talk about value, everywhere. This article, and many others like it, are not about value! Read and understand what these guys are trying to tell you. We, as a community, creating a new cryptographic p2p currency need to use it. We need to start buying and selling goods and services more and more to stabilize and increase value of the bitcoin network, not hold on to it for better and brighter futures. Trading bitcoin for fiat currency is fine, but be sure to buy bitcoins in the market too. If we continue to just hang on to the bitcoins we have for higher prices, or just sell for another currency it will just continue to fall in value and possibly die out. 
Use your bitcoin!

Which is basically what any ~~bitcoin~~ business can do.
Ask any small business owner and they'll tell you horror stories about companies that don't pay bills. Play the stock market and learn first hand how business can steal your money. Live in any economy around the world for a few decades and learn that most people are shady. Call me cynical but, a half a century in the world and 2 decades in business will put a damper on your outlook of humanity.
WhoIs query them. Ask around in BitcoinTalk.org. It's really not too difficult to find out who most of these people are or what the go by.
BTW, any consumer should do their research before putting money anywhere. One of the lead guys at BTConTilt announced he was leaving and the site hadn't been the same since. Yea it sucks you may have lost money, but it wasn't a very smart move putting money into it. It's a poker website.

Despite what everyone says, it is still profitable to mine it's just not highly profitable like it once was. Unfortunately for you 2 6770's **isn't** a profitable setup for mining 24/7 unless BTC goes back over $10 USD.
Mining has become more of a hobby sport for most involved.
If you want to get into mining you will need more capital to make it profitable for you. Making it profitable isn't just buying the necessary components to build a mining rig. At this point in the game, investing in some form of alternative energy is key to a profitable mining operation. It's very expensive and due to volatility of BTC as a commodity and not a currency you may never see that aspect pay off in the market, but rather in the long run of using it for daily use in your home.
Right now I do believe BTC is underpriced and will come back up, but I have my doubts that we will see $10 USD/1 BTC again at least for a few years if it lasts that long.
If you want to speculate at the price and make an investment into bitcoin by means of mining, please do. Bitcoin is as strong as the network that supports it and mining is a large part of that support system. If you want to make money for yourself with less risk involved, trade in the exchange but remember you are gambling and nothing is guaranteed.
*Remember there are no get rich quick schemes in life, everything is a gamble, but that's what makes life fun*

1 BTC &lt; $3.5-4
Comparing fiat value to BTC value for profitability is kind of moot. If the value of BTC to USD drops and people take their mining rigs off line it decreases the total hashing strength of the network. When hashing strength drops the difficulty does as well so that the correct amount of bitcoins are produced on a daily basis. So, the miners who are still online create more bitcoins, generating a greater income making up for lost value in the exchanges. The majority of the folks who are going to keep their miners running though tend to not watch what the current exchange rates are. A lot of us actually use bitcoins for there intended purpose, and not don't trade our BTC for paper money.

Recent hack at bitcoin7, massive sell off of funds stolen from the hack that have no intrinsic value to the new holder. When that many bitcoins are sold people trend to get scared and sell if their holdings, resulting in this. Plus it's the weekend.

Actually it would be legal. You are not paying legal tender for sex, you'd be giving a gift for sexual favors which is perfectly legal.
