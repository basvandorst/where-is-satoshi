I literally know almost nothing about bitcoin but have extreme fomo.. I already missed out when that shit was worth 200 bucks and I didnt buy.. I just want to make some money... a couple grand is all I'm asking.  What do you reccomend for me to do man??

Just bought 2000 dollars worth. Hope it's not a mistake.  Used coinbase. Is that reccomended?

Dont know shit about bitcoin but last time I didnt jump on it. Just bought 2k hopefully I dont regret it

Dude what this absolutely insane.. I just bought about 2k worth  because of this surge and my fomo.. I already missed out last time.. with the halving happening next year, and this prediction should I just hold on to what I have and buy even more when it drops again?? What if it doesn't drop when do I buy more.. I need a mentor

Just bought 2000 dollars worth on coinbase. Someone tell me I did the right thing. I already had fomo from the last surge

I want to try and buy when its low and sell when it's high, like actively trade. But the fees are killer

Gotcha bro.. I'm holding on till 100k
