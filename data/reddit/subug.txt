BitConnect was a classic ponzi promising weekly returns on your initial investment through so called "lending". They actually made the money by the rising prices of bitcoin during its bull run and by constantly recruiting new "investors" through paying YouTubers to advertise them etc. When the crash happened it all came falling down and a lot of people lost money.

@_date: 2018-01-16 20:28:20
It's the classic pump and dump to shake things. Maybe someone who shorted BTC is dumping the coins so they could get their contracts filled and profit and then stock up on cheap coins followed by pumping up the price. I for one sold all my bitcoin after buying at ATH around 19200.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:45:38

The new crypto tax is applied three times. Once when you convert to fiat, when you cash out and when you spend. Both these returns serve different purposes and follow different administrative routes. Therefore, compliance with one does not substitute compliance with the other. They are counter related. For an entity to be up to date and trade legally, it has to firstly submit CIPRO/CIPC Returns Which is the Responsibility of the Member CIPRO/CIPC Returns accumulate penalties if not paid on time.

The crypto market is being heavily manipulated by malicious actors. Every type and form of market manipulation fraud is in use. You think the crypto market cap shrinking by 100+ billion in a few days is organic? That those flash crashes are "corrections"? I might not understand crypto, but I know financial markets.

@_date: 2018-01-21 11:51:27
I don't think you're right. Each transaction has a weight which is defined this way: (tx size with witness data stripped) * 3 + (tx size). Non-Segwit transactions have zero witness data, so the weight for a non-Segwit transaction is exactly 4 times the size. Segwit transactions have some witness data so the weight is going to be less than 4 times the size. Note Segwit transactions are transmitted to Legacy nodes without witness data, so this formula will always result in blocks communicated to Legacy nodes that are less than or equal to 1,000,000 bytes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:37:57
