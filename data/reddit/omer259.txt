This pattern has been repeating weekly for some time now. It's just hard to see if you zoom out to the monthly view. It's only visible on the weekly view, but if you go back and view the past weeks it is there. We discuss this in the video if you didn't get a chance to watch it yet. But it most definitely is a pattern ...

What is the definition of a pattern?

Been using it myself on and off for 2 years. No issues so far. You can test it out with a small amount like 50$. That's how I first started. Only thing is sometimes liquidity is low but need more traders to fix that

But if it was a time Traveller wouldn't it alter history if information like this was shared?

Lol coss exchange just added Nigerian Nira fiat gateway and I was like how many Nigerians even know about bitcoin. Boy was I wrong.

I've already switched to Coss.io They recently added 0% deposit fees for Fiat and also have negative maker fees if you have more than 5,000$ volume of trading a month. So basically if you're an average trader you get paid to trade there. They also give 25% discount using their COS token if you want to market buy this is a good way to reduce your fees. And if you do hold COS tokens they also pay 50% of taker fees right back to token holders. Only issue is the Fiat gateway just launched so you will have to place your order and wait a bit (1 day or so) before it gets filled.

I already switched over to COSS exchange. They recently added 0% Fiat deposit fees. Have negative maker fees and also give 25% discount using their native COS token. On top of that they pay back 50% of all taker fees straight back to COS token holders as dividends. They are also running a bonus deposit right now. Deposit some Fiat and refer three friends to get some free Fiat in your account. Only thing is liquidity is a bit low since they are still building up. But I've noticed that if I leave buy orders up overnight they usually get filled and that too for 0 fees!

COSS.io (unless you're in US) is one of the best. They recently added 0% deposit fees and also have negative maker fees if you have more than 5,000$ volume of trading a month.

Damn I need Bitcoin to hit 100k first so I can afford a chopper

The article explains it in more detail i didn't have time to go over the whole thing because I was trying to keep it short. The full articles are linked in the video descriptions. I'm just starting out at this stuff, still a learning experience and will hopefully get better with time :)

Lol good catch ��

There is a wallet called Arax wallet on the Google Playstore and it implements GPS payments. Basically on your smartphone you can see users nearby you and you can select who you want to pay to or receive from. It's a pretty unique feature and I think should help with mainstream adoption and day to day use!

If you have 10 users and 20% of them might invest 1$ in Bitcoin you get 2$ invested into bitcoin. If you have 100 users and 20% of them might invest in bitcoin then you get 20$ invested in Bitcoin. It's simple the more people, the more adoption, the more liquidity, the more awareness, the more shilling, and of course the greater price growth.
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:40:05
It was explained near the 4 minute mark. To reach a price of 1 million$ Bitcoin would need to grow 20,000%. To reach that level adoption would need to jump from the current 7 million users to 3 billion users which is highly unlikely. Sorry if it wasn't clear or not enough math, obviously he doesn't have any public model out but he references his model from time to time in some tweets
@_date: 2019-04-13 14:59:47
Lol I agree ��
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:47:07
How much bitcoin did you pay for say one bowl? And what service do they use for the payment?
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:02:04
Except they all charge a kidney in fees
