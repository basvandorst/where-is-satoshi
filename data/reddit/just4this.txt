Consider a 24 hour period to be like 24 toilets. You are looking for the cleanest one but you can only check them in order and you can't go back.

Thanks, that's good information!  I am a shareholder in a small British company although I am an American.  I didn't know this information was so readily available.

Yes, that's the way it should be done.  It seems BTC-e is supporting values like 1.1234 BTC but not 1.12345 BTC or 1.123456 BTC which, considering the size of a satoshi, is nowhere near useful.

Is anyone else having trouble with the *reliability* of the API at BTC-e?
I've got lines of code that have successfully executed for weeks but tonight they have stopped working.  I keep getting the error "You incorrectly entered one of fields." which isn't very informative.
The suggestion was that I have too many decimals in my call but it's been working.  It backed off to the suggested 5 decimals but that also fails and so does 4.
I put in a request to their tech support but they never answered my last question so I'm asking here too.

Based on the graph at  and also looking at bitoin's performance over that same period, I would say the chart is based on the performance over the past 12 months.

I know a sure-fire way to have all your material, educational, and healthcare needs met with minimal effort on your part: just commit a non-violent felony and get yourself incarcerated in a minimum security prison.
Only a libtard would trade his freedom for mere physical benefit.

I'm glad to have found this question and answer!  I asked BTC-e exactly the same thing via their tech support and they just deleted the issue without responding.
I have another issue that's open though...

True, I haven't had much problem with getting balance and ticker information (sometimes Cloudflare gets in the way). My problem is they seem to be tweaking parameters, like the number of decimals used in a trade, without telling anyone.  That breaks working code.

There's a fortune to be made in putting up a proper exchange that can reliably support real automated trading.
