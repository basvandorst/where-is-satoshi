If anyone feels like donating to my retirement fund feel free
I really feel for you man, that really has to hurt. Remember that it's just Bitcoins, 
"Your health is your Wealth" that is one thing money will never be able to buy you!

Does BFL even have any customers left?

Vault of Satoshi has had this for months!
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:15:05
This guy doesn't understand why backing a digital currency with gold is useless, gold can be seized or lost...can't happen with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:05:22
Use Vault of Satoshi! Great exchange, very secure, great customer service...fees are free till July 5th as well...just saying

I think what I took away from this is...Bitcoin is Betamax and another alt coin maybe being VHS. Being first to market and being technically superior doesn't always win out. I think we are on the cusp of a arms race between crypto currency's in the alt market. We have reached a point where people can spot a shit coin and can understand that innovation will carry a coin much further then these PnD coins. Lots of problems still need to be solved in the crypto market...these are exciting times. Will bitcoin still be around in 2-3 years? Or will another coin take over with more superior features and solutions?
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:24:43
Did you have a balance of BTC before the collapse?
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:15:06
I think they are just rating gadgets, Bitcoin ain't no gadget!

If this true of DDos attack, the Bitcoin community has spoken...don't fuck with Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:50:51
Do some research my friend, porn was one of the main drivers behind VHS's success! The reality being able to flap at home vs flapping in a public theatre was huge lol

So Bitcoin is a business or a country but I thought it was a currency or asset? Bitcoin's value will be worth what people believe it is worth nothing else matters.
Edit : People's assumptions, pre conceptions and ideas about Bitcoin also play a factor in the value. The dollar isn't going anywhere anytime soon, Bitcoin and the technology are far ahead of its time and the sheeple aren't asking for an alternative to their worthless paper yet. When the dollar collapses and it will, it's only a matter of time till it does. You will see people investing in gold, silver and Bitcoin. That is when Bitcoin will truly see its ultimate value!

No problems here, withdrew cash this week...no problems. Transferred coins today...no problems.

Sounds like the crypto market...business as usual!

By the time you get your mining rig Bitcoin will be worth .50

I think you need to read some history books my friend, bubbles don't automatically  equal doom. They are a sign of a maturing market or a disappearing market, it's how the market reacts to the bubble which will dictate the final outcome.
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:26:00
No Vault of Satoshi, No Mintpal, Not a good info graph....I smell bias!
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:20:09
I will hold you to that...see you in about 1-2 years
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:57:19
Did I just read that right, this on the OTC?
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:00:10
You can try Local Bitcoins...I would highly suggest Vault of Satoshi. Very secure, great customer service and growing. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:12:23
I really like the tag "Money without Borders" or how bout "One World Currency" might get all the NWO conspiracy theorist nuts in a bunch!
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:53:15
Not going to happen, they would just create their own currency
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:45:54
Well put...we are defiantly spoiled in this age of impatience. Bitcoin will have its day, it will take time and I will be there to grab all the cheap coins when people give up on it.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:03:41
People will accept this as the status quo, the brain washed think this is acceptable and are led to believe they have no other choice.
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:59:09
Bitcoin passed the price of 1 gram of gold ages ago...I think your missing the point. The market cap of Bitcoin vs Gold is Yuge! Bitcoin is the size of a piece of corn in Moby Dicks shit!
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:13:36
Bitcoin is a small peon in the world of finance...Yeah no, it's quiet obvious
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:38:20
They are both the size of the Sun to Bitcoin atoms my friend

So Cointal has been in business for over a year and that's the only complaint we can find? I'm just saying that seems mighty weird. Reddit would be covered in complaints, crypto forums and even twitter would be buzzing.
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:44:53
It's not 50% tax, you are taxed on half of your investment when you cashout...and it's not a 50% tax rate
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:46:16
5% fee? WOW lol
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:15:11
The initial Reddit post was removed automatically by the removal bot on r/bitcoin and r/btc as it wasn't Bitcoin specific and was questionable.
Sounds like they where trying to do the right thing and resolve it on their end. The human factor will always be the failure point. I'm not doubting any of this as it will have to be proven in a court of law. 
I haven't seen any other complaints from other Cointal users

@_date: 2019-01-30 01:36:53
How'd that workout for Venezuela?

I am a Cointal user and haven't had any issues that's why I'm asking questions
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:19:30
Can you share said article please?
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:45:59
I've searched the interwebs and have found zero complaints and nothing on trustpilot. No complaints on forums, anywhere on twitter or anywhere else but this one post. Sounds like an unfortunate one off that they seem to be trying to fix. Cointal should have a chance to respond to the allegations. Waiting to see their response.

1. Don't store your Bitcoin on Exchanges
2. Don't store your Bitcoin on Exchanges
3. DON'T STORE YOUR BITCOIN ON EXCHANGES!
Get a Ledger or Trezor Hardware wallet and store your on Bitcoin them. If you want to trade use a small amount of your stack or move back to hardware wallet after trading. Make sure to backup your Seed from your HW on a hard medium like a Billfodl or stamped into a piece of stainless steel and covered, store in safe place. Finally enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:35:39
This is your seed that you keep in a safe place, maybe multiple copies. Being your own bank is a big responsibility and can be scary. But with freedom comes personal responsibility.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:55:30
And so it begins, banks control everything and can shut you out. So how will Bitcoin deal with the fact that you can't buy electricity, food or even internet? How are you going to access your Bitcoin with no internet?
