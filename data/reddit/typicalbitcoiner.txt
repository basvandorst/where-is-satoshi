Me on my corporate throne as I watch the buttcoiners and their lizard masters toil away in my bitcoin mines doing hashes by hand.

Fuck this country I don't want to live in a world where I can't hire assassin's to murder people I don't like.

All hail bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:30:42
If only bitcoin had existed back then the civil war wouldn't have even happened.

Nice vote manipulation.

They don't give a shit unless they can get publicity out of it.   My house was destroyed in a flash flood and all I got from them was one night in a hotel.  Trace Adkins stupid redneck ass had his house catch on fire and they send a fucking army out to help that stupid rich fuck.   Fuck the Red Cross.

I wish there was more we could do to help out these freedom fighters.   In the future people will look back upon these gentlemen as we do Nelson Mandela today.   Falsely imprisoned for trying to forge a brighter future for us.

Amazing work.   This should help increase adoption at an amazing rate. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:39:48
Merely speedbumps on the road to global financial freedom.

It must be.  The tipping craze is catching on at such a rate that now nearly everyone has some bitcoin.  That's why the price is falling because no one needs to buy any.  Tipping is helping spread the wealth one bit at a time.

We just have to try harder.   Bitcoin is for everyone.   Satoshi wanted financial freedom for everyone not just certain groups. Bitcoin will be a success when everyone, terrorists included, can use it to free themselves from the tyranny of the banking sector. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:50:44
You are the reason why adoption has been so low.   You are blight upon Bitcoin's good name. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:24:52
As long as we believe in Bitcoin with all of hearts then it can never truly fail. In Satoshi's name.  amen. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:55:43
Credit cards are merely the shackles that bind us and keep us from true financial freedom.   Using bitcoin is like the breeze on your face during a sweltering summer afternoon.   A cool refreshing drink that eventually everyone will partake in.

We are on the edge of a Bitcoin awareness explosion.  Nothing but good news has come out of the Bitcoin scene over the last year.  The fundamentals have not changed one iota and it is on these fundamentals that Bitcoin will succeed.   The public is becoming quickly aware of the advantages that Bitcoin can offer thanks to amazing proponents such as Andreas,  Roger Ver,  and Eric Voorhees.  These pioneers sacrifice daily to bring Satoshi's gift to the masses.   Your doubt we'll be your downfall.  Bitcoin can not fail. Only you can fail bitcoin.

How dare you question my undying devotion to the tool that will bring about a financial revolution.   You sir and your ilk are the reason Bitcoin has yet to reach critical mass.   So quick to label any revolutionary as a troll.   Which bank do you work for? I imagine you have been deep cover for awhile.   Tell your fat cat boss that he can never surpress me nor will his friends ever be able to impede the Bitcoin revolution.   You and your statist buddies are powerless over the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:02:46
Yo should take your anti-bitcoin rhetoric back to buttcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:21:48
Bitcoin will only die when we decide to let it die. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:42:00
No way to game that.   No sir.   Excellent idea. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:17:12
How can anyone deny that bitcoin is going to the moon? They can't, this log chart is proof that the future is bright and that  the fundamentals still hold strong.  Look how stable that chart is.   Fuck the fiat statist scum.   Hail Bitcoin!
