I agree, but there are only a few of these coins that actually hold some merit. Most of the coins in the top 10 are overhyped shitcoins. ETH is definitely the king of the smart contract coins. It will be good for enterprise. By shitcoins I meant EOS, ADA, tron, BCH etc. basically the new coins are overhyped shitcoins

There is nothing anyone can do if they Know your BTC address. The user  loaded on bitcointalk publicly disclosed his Wallet worth hundreds of millions. If all my coins were on one wallet I would feel safe posting the address.

A ton of newbies joined in 2017 and that essentially ruined community. Now the community is full of get rich quick kids that don’t even understand how crypto works. I’m certain many of the new people in the community have never even done a cryptocurrency transaction. Also, many newbies here buy into the altcoin hype and shill shitcoins. They don’t even know what they are shilling. One thing I wish newbies would do is look at the top 10 coins in coin marketcap. the top 10 coins change nearly every year. What always stays number one? Bitcoin. Yet they shill these shitcoins and will eventually get destroyed and then they’ll leave the crypto market forever. The community will never go back to how it was.

Not your address, your BTC address.

Yeah, but ADA is mostly hype. Ethereum can do everything ADA can do and better. Plus ADA hasn’t been around as long as ETH so it hasn’t withstood the test of time yet. Not to mention ethereum network is significantly larger than ADAs too. Once ethereum upgrades to Casper and sharding, ADA will be redundant

How is this FUD? This is truth. I only care about Bitcoin, Bch is worthless to me. That’s why I’m concerned, Bitcoin **IS** my investment. Why would I be posting here otherwise? Idgaf about the bch and btc circlejerk like everyone on rbtc and rbitcoin. I only care about the health of Bitcoin. I did not get any valid explanations hence why I answered them all in this post. *If you have a valid explanation please do tell*. It’s insane how many people on this sub have no idea how bitcoin works, yet they are invested in it. 
BCH has less volume than Bitcoin. If I’m worried about bitcoin then why the hell would I bat an eye at bch? Think instead of calling people with legitimate concerns trolls.

This is true unfortunately.

I wish number 1 Was completely true, but it’s only partially true. Bitcoin was averaging 220,000 per day prior to batching. After we were seeing 180,000. This last week we’ve been around 180,000. Today it’s 79,000... that’s what worries me

Segwit wouldn’t cause less transactions per day, It just decreases transaction size allowing for more throughput.

Thank you for this response, seems like you may be one of the few here that understands this. What do you think this may entail for the future of bitcoin?

Yes this is true, but this was also true last week. We’ve been averaging 180,000 with the aftermath of the FOMO and bull run. Even before the bull run we had more  transactions back in 2016 and 2015. It hasn’t been this low for a very long time. Even last week we had double the transactions. I think this is telling of something... idk what yet, but we always used to say the most important metric of bitcoin was the transactions per day. Nobody says that anymore because the numbers are declining, but it still holds true. Transactions per day are the most important metric (besides hash rate). They were consistently increasing from 2009 - 2017. This is the first year where we have been negative (so far) in transaction volume. This is not good. Actually this is very bad, especially since the transaction fees are so low. I know tomorrow it will have a higher transactional volume (usually does) but I hope the decline doesn’t continue.
