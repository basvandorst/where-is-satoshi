hey thanks - its good to see people at least looking into things - sorry about the writing style, if you pick out the major concerns i can try to more clearly explain them- regards. 
i'll have to work out how to use this tip bot !

Two (2)  Questions
Hi Gavin Kolin Evans here are you aware of; and what do you think about the "Mini Blockchain" of which concept was and idea of a web designer "Bitfreak" JD, in which he employed a random coder to build it.
any comments?
Details here:
Pop Cast:
This has dynamic unlimited block sizes and a tree which is currently around **150K** (yes k) large with the total BC being about **20~Mb** (yes Mb)
Could "Bitcoin" (the block-chain) move to a system like that in the future? 
Which would solve (of course) the scalability (transactions volume) and size issues.
Also do you think the economics of Bitcoin are viable?
this concern seemed to be alluded to by Sen Paul J. Massicotte here: - 
And I explained some concerns here: 
in your own time if you decide to answer, Great AMA. and keep up the great work.

In fact;  based on this same reliable data let me just cook up the best Crypto currency in the history of man kind. If you buy this bullshit you will.love our new IPO ! 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:30:12
this is an impressive amount of bullshit - banks are like "oh shit we just discovered Bitcoin" ! aaaahhhhh lets troll the internet.

Bitcoin began distribution in 2009.

please give feedback we are keen to learn, i'm not a coder.
This looks like a very interesting proposal, i did read it and the ELI5 by lifeboatz

Lucky you're not then hey?
We don't have cult members , we have people that want to get more education so they know what to invest in when everything else is a turd.
Do i look like i care? I've heard it all before, I work slowly towards more security more adoption. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 11:29:59
Ya , based on this same reliable data NXT has a huge market Cap and is one of the best distributed most successful Crypto in the history of mankind. So , ya know , there's that... 
@_date: 2014-08-02 07:51:03
* Equilibrium Reward occurs post primary distribution this is the "inflation".
* As long as there is no monopoly in the primary distribution period there is always an increasing number of free market forces deciding valuation.
I can put this into plain language by saying Sally and Bob and 15 other people mine Quark none of these people trust each other Sally and Bob can work together but the others wont, no one can "decide" the price, and less in the future. 
This is why the price immediately floored as primary distribution was occurring with Quark.
Then the free market takes over.
* multi algorithm prevents the easy ability to gain monopoly.
* but it's multi algorithm + short distribution that achieved this in Quarks case.
Granted it could have been say 12 months but its of no big consequence.
* checkpoints plus decentralized PoW make Quark quite flexible and robust.
Key difference Quark can only get more decentralized and more robust , Bitcoin is the inverse if that literally. 
You see you've been sold a lie, and no one is going to help you learn unless people educate themselves, but that's something one does as an individual. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 12:09:25
Presently Bitcoin is basically NXT in its price manipulation so if I'm wrong we should see this fabulous organic price rise and if I'm correct the tide will go out on this centralized system and leave a lot of bag holders , admittedly after that there might be reform, but what will it be worth? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:49:44
Vectors that will save Quark from terminal collapse but won't save Bitcoin
Some are Economic and some are technical in vector as this is aimed for a Crypto (Bitcoin cult) audience my job is easier.
 
* EQ reward , (you will call this inflation) but its not of course it aims to keep the currency stable. 
* EQ reward means normal transactions are fee free , BTC cult will say that's not a big deal but perhaps you should head over to your main stream media friends and corporate VC to find out if that's a big deal or not? 
Basically its life and death in any potential competition with visa master card. 
* EQ reward means no single enitity can gain terminal control of the currency supply and make it a "useless museum item."
* multi algorithm plus 6 month primary disto means the free market controlled the price as is historical record.
* multi algorithm and full distribution means that there is no mining control , no mining monopoly possible.
* no mining monopoly means no price manipulation.
* total almost absolute mining monopoly 
* extensive price manipulation that has caused a terminal trap of proliferation.
I.e the few that control the price can't spend it otherwise the price will collapse ha ha.
* technically 51% owned by major holders but much worse is the centralized algorithm where by in theory a solo miner can drive difficulty to 51% this is because of the "flawed" single algorithm design.
* paradox of use before halving not many knew of it post halving ASICs control mining causing a use / collapse paradox.
**Summary of how Bitcoin terminal collapse may proceed.**
Terminal collapse may come when "use" utilization  freezes because of the use valuation collapse paradox .
I.e the trap looks like this the central owners control the price by not selling into the free market. 
But if they do sell into the free market for "goods" then the recipient trades that back into the market causing a price decline.
However the free market can not be controlled , so the market will force this valuation.
However here is where it gets hairy , with centralized devices growing larger every day when the price moves to non manipulation valuation the difficulty will still be very high , this will cause further terminal centralization, because remember we can't know essentially who in the pools own all the hardware this means that even a private interest (think China sitting on trillions if USD) could have much more than 50% of the network for extensive amounts of time. 
And as an attacker can essentially "rewrite history" back to manual checkpoints this does not bode well for investment.
* note when i say China sitting in Trillions i don't imply that the Chinese government would bother I'm talking about super rich (in US paper) private citizens. In this scenario that would seek to probably use the "unlimited Bitcoin" to buy other assests. 
**The "Why" around why that can't happen to Quark**
* Quark starts as base money and is driven by the free market, when it starts to trend ascent against fiat paper it will not likely be a violent jolt but a steady rise  (as i originally predicted) ( and as is effectively happening now )
* this steady rise might gain interest but by the time a single entity would find it viable to try to build an ASIC or "specialized super efficient  device"  - to gain advantage the rest of th market would be mining in greater proportion.
* next point - The potential ASIC would be competing  for the ability to to mine a single block (the EQ reward)
**The Next one is important but will be misunderstood**
"motive of change" algorithm is shifted Basically  this relates to the efficiency  of Software over Hardware  PLUS the motivations of the users using the software -
So for example if the primary users are PC users now i.e CPU and GPU - if the developer came out and said : **"WE are going to hard fork and we are shifting the algorithm to one that is going to assure the continuance of PC mining (CPU GPU)"** the market has a dedicated motive to do this, and thus the clients move with the market.
The efficiency and motive of software instantly means that any hardware monopoly is rendered invalid past the hard fork. 
The only way this can exist is because of the algorithms original design + the full distribution and the EQ reward. 
 
@_date: 2014-09-09 13:13:55
just think, you never listened to me ha ha 
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:13:02
Quark and a few other Gen 2 Cryptocurrency solved the "fee problem" a long time ago - also did it without compromising on decentralization and also at a much lower power consumption.
* Quark is fee free 
* Quark is truly decentralized.
* Its a real market due to its decentralization.
* it can't be regulated.
* its not an IPO scam or a Crypto derivative.
* it has a block-chain that sticks to the "one CPU one vote" principal.
It achieved it all though decentralized economic innovation and superior design, if you disagree feel free to vote this down into obscurity, but whatever you do don't try to prove me wrong or anything ha ha.
waiting for silence now...

@_date: 2014-08-02 02:14:55
100% incorrect Quark brought multiple key evolutions to cryptocurrency , and whenever we talk about them religious Bitcoin proponents usually run away , could we discuss them here perhaps? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:49:35
want to see what a crypto looks like that is controlled by the free market and not price manipulation?:
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:20:42
And indeed i have heard that a lot..
Yes that's no problem im well aware of what and how an ASIC can be made.
QUARK is distributed and flows with the free market and mining is competition for the EQ reward.
Mining monopoly on a long distribution currency = Price control. 
The extreme of that is for example say NXT - which i exposed on my blog here:
 
If NXT had of only traded on their own exchange (or could have enforced that) in theory NXT could trade at 1billion USD per NXT.
Ill leave that with you to ponder. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 04:55:21
Oh you mean hope in the halving structure to keep monopoly while trying to convince "the man on the street" to either buy at a manipulate price or use it as a "payment system" of which its not very efficient, and has fundamental instability due to the price manipulation.
Ok no worries.
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:41:45
interesting 
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:16:38
speaking of dead check out the "terminal collapse" update.  : D
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:58:41
Just a heads up, can you link to the "Scalability Road Map" post as it may be of interest to the designers of the mini BC or other readers. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 11:04:40
Signing up soon Great innovation can't wait to test it out. great work !
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:10:40
this is the only actual real answer.
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:10:55
Except of course if Bitcoin was say , oh you know, heading for a terminal collapse, something like that could wreak a "first mover advantage"...  wouldn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:21:07
Quark is fee free. - this is because it has an EQ reward, It set the stage for Zeta, both Quark and Zeta are in effect fee free on little transactions. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:10:46

go hard sweet Romanizer
I'll be here laughing at you later on, personally i don't care if you invest in dog shit, i'm not here to "push Quark" on anyone i couldn't give a shit.
you and your other weird cult members made allegations and i set them straight that's the only reason i'm still talking to you, usually the Bitcoin cult run away once i start talking real facts, we hear the chirping of the crickets ... its easier to believe in the meme..
 we already have a growing base of investors that are educating themselves on all the things you are ignorant on.
so when your Bitcoin world falls apart and has to be rebuilt we will still be growing. 
maybe its like the turtle and the hair thing? 
except your investment is dog shit , and ours is pretty good? 
are you seeing that?

@_date: 2014-09-12 11:35:57
yeah i don't think Bitcoin is especially stable or a good store of value, but Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum, also maybe the Yen speaks more the fact that one nation can make the other one destroy their fiat currency in the event of a "currency war"
but you are not really going to understand any of that. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:45:41
Someone is a little uncomfortable. Don't worry little fellow, ignore it.

@_date: 2014-08-19 17:08:57
So confidence in economic fundamentals are "laughable"  ?  one for Buttcoin? 
its a friendly bet for 100,000 Quark. based on pure simple % gain, in Yuan.
@_date: 2014-08-02 12:05:55
Nope there was no chance to be "lazy" as i can prove though proof of work that the currency was distributed on primarily CPU and dumped onto the market , so you see we don't have to "try" to fake anything.
I love those large wallets i dont care about them they are irrelevant, we have an EQ reward.
You see with Bitcoin you have up until first halving a very small number of people that mined it so that's 50% and then now you have perhaps an even smaller amount mining, you are a tard if you buy into that in my opinion, but they I'm just a guy on the interent.
Yeah do what you feel, its a beautiful free market. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:35:02
Points up for the corporate speak, however I'd just say "the tide is going out" on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:11:23


Do you have an opinion on which Governments are the "worst", what is your opinion of Central Banking  as a whole? 
(i don't want to give the worse ones a heads up or anything) 
your opinion on Debt issued money secondarily?
Janet Yellen basically agreed that the USA is an Oligarchy, (or didn't say it wasn't when directly asked) 
Do you think Oligarchy is the best that humanity can manage? if so is this the "best type of Government" ??
@_date: 2014-09-10 05:00:49
I can confirm that he also attacks Quark, he has randomly attacked Quark before (pathetically) on Reddit I have a lot of real followers.
 
don't sweat it they always attack Quark and any other real Crypto including extensive attacks against eMuni, they are hired by Banking institutions. 
hopefully they bring Crypto together. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 08:00:57
ASICs are a meme that have been sold to you, all an ASIC does is allow Monopoly Bitcoin has the worst of all parameters.
* long distribution
* Mining monopoly
* fixed supply 
* centralized network.
* short primary distro
* free market
* EQ reward + fee free 
* always more decentralized network
Which one has better long term fundamentals? 
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:27:22

 "amazing opportunities await you on the internet.." - {Pamphlet in shopping trolly.} 
@_date: 2014-08-02 12:21:21
Yeah that's the "Mooore power! " meme you've been sold.
More power does not = more security.
Actually it means less in Bitcoins case, ill let you try to figure that out yourself grab a pen and a bit of paper and draw a picture. 
Also this is as low as Quark will get so its still growing Bitcoin of course, is heading for a cliff. 
Which one is a better investment? 
@_date: 2014-08-02 11:49:07
Well that's only because they got lazy, with a couple of simple  scripts one can split the Crypto into multiple random addresses and do it at random numbers so they look "real." So you're really going to say with a straight face that the data you are quoting is "how it is" if so, maybe you should buy some more Bitcoin? Don't let me stop you. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:08:15
yeah 100 % know what you mean except its **taken out of context it was a reply to someone in Bitcoin about the differences between the two**, there is just "Cryptocurrency" of course Bticoin has a "first leader advantage" - i support a number of Crypto and i always support addressing issues the point being Bitcoin is actually heading for a terminal collapse - but instead of addressing ANY issues they sell a "payment system" MEME.
As i don't hold ANY Bitcoin and wouldn't (because i know the industry) i don't really care its not a worry to me i hold a basket of crypto and no they won't disappear if Bitcoin collapses. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:51:57
Gavin, If the price stabilizes lower (as most are predicting here)
What stops the new and large miners (read China) from just taking over the network if the original monopoly of miners can't compete with them.
i.e if the "Retail" aspect of mining leaves and margins get squeezed making some parts of the globe virtually permanently "non viable"
does this open the chance that others with much lower overheads to simply take control of the Bitcoin Network.
Is this simply the flaw with a single algorithm and long distribution that halves.
any ideas or suggestion on how "Bitcoin" the brand tackles this possible effect?
or even any comments on why you think that can't happen?

thanks for the feedback, I'll check out your blog from time to time.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:12:23
the fact that this is not addressed or discussed proves in part it is correct. - its not "nice friendly" talk other Crypto address issues, Quark has a low hash-rate issue and a few other point at the moment we are all (the real supporters)  working on it  Bitcoin has a "Payment system" Meme  "Buy the Crypto Gold" meme.  - yet its heading clearly for some sort of terminal collapse as explained.
"don't mind that cliff guys, Buy the crypto gold ! " 
"payment system" 
@_date: 2014-08-02 09:54:02
Yeah only the best distributed in Cryptocurrency . Think about that.
