this seems like a mistake honestly
coming from someone whos married
get a ring, it doesnt have to be that much money, you can literally find a really nice ring for like $3 grand
dont shill out and not give her anything, that is just a huge problem waiting to happen

I mean Return on investment.
Youre looking at bigger X return on altcoins than BTC in the long term.
If bitcoin hits $1,000,000 from today youre looking at a 100x return from bitcoin, so invest $100, you make $10,000 if it hits 1 Million
If youre looking at Bitcoin cash from today to ATH, youre already looking at around a 20x return and past that to further ATH's, if you invest $100 today and wait for Bitcoin Cash to hit ATH again, youre already looking at $2000 return
Bitcoin is fantastic, but if Crypto does become as huge as people want it to be, you will see the biggest gains from altcoins and not bitcoin directly

It’s been right 3 times now, gotta wait till October to see if it’ll be debunked completely

About 99% of people in Crypto are about the money
I could care less if we end up using crypto or the dollar, majority of people are looking at Bitcoin as an investment
In the long run bitcoin will not be used as a currency, something else well

it doesnt, its just a good watch

Hey Papa! You can buy them from me! Each one right now is about $20,000 so ill need that much in order to buy you one!

The prophecy was just for this year though
and its been pretty close/accurate to the bottom price for each month
it never went under $9200 in July and if it did it was by like $50-$100 dollars and the case was the same for the previous months
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:44:48
depends how much you spend
my wife isnt materialistic but if proposed without a ring she would have said no immediately probably and left and i wouldnt blame her
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:37:10
It’s happening... here comes the big one

Thats fair, i like it
@_date: 2019-07-31 12:13:40
Good luck man, heres hoping it does reach those levels for all of our sakes
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:25:02
im just looking forward to what late 2019 numbers look like
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:12:57
Just to clarify, Ethereum will be updated to version 2.0 or there will be a new coin made called Ethereum 2.0?
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:26:40
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:18:55
Its kind of a given that with BTC rising so will everything else
by altcoins i mean Eth, Litecoin, Bitcoin cash, etc there will always be competition for Bitcoin thats not going away ever
shitty coins will end but do you really think BTC will by the ONLY Crypt 10-20 years from now? Youre delusional if you think that

i mean he was right three time in a row
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:11:15
100%, i had an old Toyota Sienna minivan that my dad gave to me at like 250,000 miles, it still pulled strong with no issues at like 300,000 miles when i sold it and more than likely still doing fine today

No one knew it was gonna blow up the way it did. Don’t feel too bad about it.
It’s like someone telling you that 5 years from now Nike shorts size L in black will be worth $50,000. You would never even guess.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:38:12
Yes it does. It literally means we have bottomed. At least from what this post is trying to say.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:49:41
Oh I 100% agree
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:54:58
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:12:26
not sure why youre being downvoted youre 100% correct
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:12:59
youre literally in about 1-2% of the people interested in crypto for this
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:37:03
What's a bitcoin node?
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:11:29
could go either way, its either priced in or not. Look at the Litecoin having happening in a couple days, but i really doubt the halving will sky rocket the price THAT much
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:54:47
THE PROPHECY HAS SPOKEN
@_date: 2019-10-01 20:35:10
Whos funding this?
They should make this public so bitcoin hodlers can fund them too
this is great
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:26:51
It will probably hit new ath's now since you sold
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:48:17
Bitcoin will NEVER win against the USD
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:30:08
Its ATH was the same as BTC's

Tesla is truly the best investment of 2019
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:18:44
Realistically altcoins will have a really nice jump but that won’t happen till BTC goes over 20k or closes in on it
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:37:22
I bought more too
its just gonna go back up anyways
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:43:03
