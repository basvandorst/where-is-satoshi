North Koreas shitty behaviour is overt, Americas is covert.
One isn't better than the other, but North Koreas transgressions are a lot more honest.
If you're going to eff me over, be honest about it...don't put your arm around me whilst leading me to a cell!

It's very realpolitik.
The language of lies.

Why should it have to take time and effort? What does that say about the system supposedly designed for one and all? Shouldn't these processes aid us, the citizen, in enabling us to go about our lives with minimal stress? So why do the majority of people feel as though they're being made to jump through hoops? I see the same sense of frustration within so many people I know irl, at processes similar to what was described upthread. People who work and contribute are being made to feel guilty before being proven innocent.
People are as overworked as ever, finding the balance between work and life takes so much focus and dedication, and putting the onus back on the individual for a mistake created through bureaucracy, merely shifts the focus as to where the blame lies.
If the system wasn't so inherently broken, with one well meaning idea piled up on top of each other as to render the whole system senseless, it becomes completely counter-intuitive to what makes us humans. When that happens, I cannot help but question its validity.
Sure, it'll keep a couple of departments ticking over so they can continue to justify their existence, but that's all it's there for. It isn't right. People have committed suicide over being hounded for tax bills, what the actual proverbial?
