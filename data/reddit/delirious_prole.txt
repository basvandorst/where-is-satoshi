I don’t understand the hate for price talk. It is part of what bitcoin encompasses. I believe it is a slow revolution and am a hodler but it seems puerile to chastise a member of this community for examining price action. Greed as an incentive to participate and provide security is one of the really cool parts about the tech.

How to pay for roads? If we can transfer value to one another without needing a middleman like a govt or bank, then we can accomplish projects through direct democracy. 
It should start with democracy in the workplace. The workers should be able to democratically decide what to do with the surplus value added by their labor. Right now, higher ups keep a lot of that added value as profit, instead of paying you. 
Bitcoin can remove the higher up from the equation, allowing the workers to own the means of production. Anything of value can be programmed and sent peer to peer. In this scenario we don’t need a private corporation to print money or a central government to allocate resources.It will be a while yet before we see mass adoption and societal disruption, but if you’re asking how we improve infrastructure, we have to end corrupt, centralized state power. When communities can actually decide and have the money to make changes for the better, they will.

Bitcoin is real money, like the silver backed notes that JFK implemented before they assassinated him. Only this time there is no one to assassinate, we all own the network by participating. D E C E N T R A L I Z A T I O N

Controversial opinion:
This is dumb. If I drove by this I would be put off by the obvs bitcoin grab using your kids. They’re just reselling shitty blue bell ice cream? And really, there is no way anyone is typing in that string of numbers instead of using a QR code. It’s, like, bizarro late stage capitalism where I’d actually prefer to give my money to a Corp who would at least put in a little effort. 1/10 made me reply.

Well of course they won’t just roll over, Bitcoin maximalists assert that the banks won’t have a choice. How’d you get to work today, horse drawn carriage or car? You write letters to your wife or do you text her? Superior technology always wins, even if it seems like old money has the advantage.

The capitalist system inherently exploits. By design, most of the value of labor is appropriated by a ruling class as “profit”. 
In socialism, the people who do the labor decide democratically what to do with the fruits of it, and indeed what fruits are produced. I agree it can only work p2p. 
The federal reserve is a middleman. They sell money with interest and perpetuate debt slavery. They can be disrupted. The capitalist is a middleman.
Why should we have to “exchange” the value of our labor in a “free market” for the goods and services we need for survival. Why don’t we just...collectively own the means and mode of production? 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:23:00
Capitalism isnt decentralized though. It is the definition of centralized money. heard of the federal reserve? They literally print it. Socialism is what bitcoin enables and encourages. Imagine a p2p democracy. The United States and all nation-states have slipped away into the annuls of time as we move towards decentralized autonomous organizations. We vote on society's organization in real time, with our phones. We are a more fluid, agile, and democratic society after the nation-states fall. Being able to use bitcoin for micropayments means the nature of the workplace can change. Jobs and titles won't be static, labor will arise organically to build public works. Private, for-profit corporations will become less and less prevalent as "workplaces" become more democratic. We are animals, and predictable. Socialism before we had the tools (internet,blockchain) was usually just state capitalism or Bolshevism.   
Universal Basic Income is a band-aid on capitalism. It ensures the cycle of consumption is uninterrupted. I would like to **disrupt** it completely with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is seizing the means of production.

The economy slows when the capitalist doesn’t pay the worker enough to buy the product. He then issues credit to the worker he ripped off, in order that the worker may continue to consume products. This is a debt based economy. It doesn’t reward savers, inflation devalues their wealth over time. The system rewards mindless consumption. 
Asymmetrical wealth appropriation. Capitalism inherently exploits the real producers so that 63 people can own more than half the world’s wealth. Capitalists are getting rich producing obnoxious, useless fidget spinners. Our very lives are wasted for arbitrary trinkets.

wow. i am very impressed.

Oh no a world where nobody is trying to sell you useless shit that pollutes the Earth! If our currency is deflationary, we only spend it on important stuff like food. So then profits go to those that produce...important stuff like food. You see where this is going? We could all choose what to do with the surplus of our labor and save the rest. 
We create wealth by using real money. For a cool trick, take your rapidly devaluing fiat currency and purchase real money with it. Hodl the real money until the collapse of rampant imperialism. Congrats, you now have actual wealth. So what I’m saying is... buy bitcoin.
