@_date: 2015-06-16 18:31:08


you have this backwards. if any nodes announce a block greater than 1MB without consensus, they will be an alt-chain.

nodes don't decide to make 20MB blocks. Miners who stay on the original version will ignore 20MB blocks on the alt-chain.

Most of the merchants so far have been exclusive to the U.S. I go out of my way to use bitcoin and am even willing to pay a slightly higher price for now to encourage merchants, but Amazon really needs to get on board — internationally. 
Another thing is that people are afraid to spend something that might be worth more in a year. The oft-cited solution is to just buy more to replace what you spend so that your holdings don't decrease, but that involves sending money to an exchange and purchasing more coins. Not a huge hurdle, but still a hurdle. We all need to start spending whenever and wherever we can so that we don't lose any big name merchants.

You sound like the perfect candidate for a [Trezor]( They're supposed to be very secure and very difficult to screw up. 
If you have more than a few hundred dollars in bitcoin, you really should consider sending it to a paper wallet until have have time to figure out a way that works best for you.
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:05:26

They'll have another batch soon enough. Paper wallets are hard to beat though. And they're not too difficult to set up. Even if you don't do the Live CD stuff, just disconnect from the internet and it will still be safer than storing a large amount on your online computer.

Except his digital cash was robbed, not his bank or anyone holding it for him. A hardware wallet probably would have prevented this. If bitcoin is really too hard for you then just don't use it. Meanwhile there are thousands and thousands of people who haven't had their bitcoins robbed. It's really not as hard as you make it sound.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:46:18
He's wrong about merchant adoption. Most merchants do settle for fiat, but not all of them. Some keep a percentage. And he's speculating about transaction volume increase. I don't see anything particularly upvoteworthy about his comment.

That's not what a red herring is. If anything it's a false analogy, but it's not even false. Since you like analogies, it's more like one guy saying, "Your tool is useless", and the other guy saying, "My tool works does the same thing as your tool and more."

What would it take for you to actually use them? Besides the lack of merchants, the other thing that keeps me from using them more is the issue of tax liabilities for every purchase. I hate taxes enough already, and this is just going to make it a nightmare.

If important figures are still actively working in the bitcoin space, but no longer posting on reddit or the dev mailing list, that doesn't indicate that they're burned out by bitcoin. They're likely burned out by endless distractions from people who are just being disruptive.

Have they moved from the correct address into the mixing pool? When I sent last week, the coins moved pretty fast but did not show up for about 4 hours. I have some withdrawals scheduled and haven't seen anything yet. They're spread out across 96 hours and it's been about a day so far. I also can't make new deposit addresses. It says to try again later. 
There's this too.

Yeah. Probably dogecoin.

No, I downvoted because I hate when people complain about downvotes. Stop lying to yourself about it. Every post on reddit gets downvotes FYI.

Let us know if your coins show up. Fingers crossed.

exactly the opposite. ethereum's history revision damages integrity of all blockchains. ethereum is not a blockchain anymore. it is a distributed database with centralised guardians.

If you really think that a fixed monetary supply is better than an infinite monetary supply, then your Masters in Econ is worthless.

I got my first withdrawal. Logged in and saw this:








I can generate new addresses again too.

I have 4 or 5 withdrawals and I spread it out over 96 hours. I know its random, but do you think its unusual that I still haven't gotten anything? Have you ever had the problem of not being able to make new deposit addresses? Something might be wrong.

BIP 148 is the line in the sand. bitmain is just desperate trying to protect asicboost profit.

Or you could just store your coins on a hardware wallet yourself so you don't get phished.
