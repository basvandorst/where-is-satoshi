I would say it's neither incompetence or arrogance, and most likely due to inexperience.
When your a non-native speaker and you spend 8 hours a day speaking keigo, then 8 hours a day speaking casual Japanese it's very easy to make a few slips now and then (both ways).
In Kerpals case, I doubt Mt.Gox is your typical Japanese business environment, so his ability and experience with polite Japanese is probably lacking.

Sure, but I imagine his lawyers, accountants, etc take care of most of the work. His business also seems to employ mainly foreign staff, so I doubt he's speaking Japanese 9-5.

So they decide to move... how does this solve their problem? People will just send stuff to the new address.

Getting your Bitcoins into fiat currency can be a problem for some people, it depends what country you live in, what bank your with, and a lot of exchanges have monthly limits on withdrawals.

Why are you so sure something like this isn't possible? Complex websites like Coinbase have tons of vulnerabilities just waiting to be discovered. Most of the time these vulnerabilities are found by security experts or talented hackers after a bounty, but not everyone has such good intentions. You can be sure that sites like Coinbase are the target of hundreds of attacks and probes every day.

It's highly probable Coinbase has several vunerabilities that haven't been discovered yet. Even now Gmail/Facebook/Twitter, huge sites that have been running for years have vulnerabilities revealed every other month, why would you think Coinbase wouldn't have any?
But sure, not as likely, but possible.
Considering the API access originated from Belarus, most likely OP's machine is infected by a trojan or OP kept a copy of his API key somewhere that the attacker was able to access (email, a piece of code for a project, etc)

Apple have been a massive disappointment as a company over the last few years. While their products are beautiful, well made and a joy to use, the way they do business, especially with regards to the app store, has made me want to jump ship for a while now. I have an iPhone 4 and a Mac Book that I use daily and I'm not about to throw them out the window, but my next purchases will not be from Apple.

Still, even if you have the API enabled, someone needs to know your API key to authenticate with the API. How would someone know it? If you haven't made this information public, then it's very likely a vulnerability exists in Coinbase, and you should make some more enquiries, and possibly seek to have your bitcoins refunded to you.

Deposits 10 pound? Their site says they accept deposits by Faster Payments transfers, which should be free from any UK bank, is this not the case?
EDIT: Wow, according to their **[FAQ]( this seems to be the case. What a rip off... I pay 10 pound for a SEPA transfer to deposit funds to Kraken in Germany, users shouldn't be charged for depositing money from a UK account to another UK account, especially when this service is free.

The question is, how was someone able to get your API Key? You said you were going to use it for some future project, is it possible you uploaded it to any repositories, like github?
If you haven't made it public, then this means it's very likely Coinbase has a vulnerability.
