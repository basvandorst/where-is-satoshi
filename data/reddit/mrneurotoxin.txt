What with the protagonist doing morphine and ridiculous amounts of adderall, taking someone else down for non-prescribed drugs would have just been silly.

Well, to be fair, no matter how ridiculous this looks, you really wouldn't be able to transfer money this way if it was a traditional bank transfer.
Are we nearing the moon, soon?

Is it Eddie Money?
I'm going with Eddie Money.

What I think is he should get his bitcoin/payments, with tax. He (alledgely) sold only legal items, so even if he has to pay more tax, he'd still get *some* money out of it, even if it's less than he originally wanted or intended to.
Of course with bitcoin not being treated as a "real currency", things won't be so easy for him or his sales, but if he really was selling only legal goods, it should be treated like normal sales in a local store.

But it was his first time posting about accepting BTC donations this morning. I've been a Gramatik fan for a few years, but this was the first time I heard about this.

Man, that first video (Brent) was hilarious.
"*This*. Is a machete."

Well, I never became an astronaut, but I still reached the moon. Neat.

Yeah I feel a bit sad for buying a vaporizer for 0.22 btc, when the price was around $1100. Could have bought almost six for that amount if I did it now. Oh well, it has served me well and seen its fair share of use, so no regrets.

Fuck the moon, this ship is headed towards Mars.

In my experience, everybody with an expensive, tailormade suit. Hell, I totally would. Cufflinks can be pretty badass.

I used to work for this company, glad to see these news!
They're good guys and the stuff they sell is fantastic for the most part.

That dude has some serious balance and core control.

Says someone still paying for a very outdated subscription-based MMO.
Well, can't please everyone, they're the ones missing out.

A little surprised to see my country, Finland, so high up. Neat.

Well, in their defense, I used to play for a few years myself. I just find it hard to understand how people, who basically live in a digital world still find bitcoin so hard to comprehend and/or think it's a scam or just like shares.

Musk, in my opinion.
I just can't wrap my head around the fact that Sini Saarela is on that list at all.
