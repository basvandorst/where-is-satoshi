Consider donating to the organization I work for: Foresight Institute, a non-profit institute focused on advancing the benefits, and avoiding the dangers of technologies of fundamental importance for the human future, e.g. molecular machines, longevity, cybersecurity, AI, and blockchains.
We’re a small organization but have a lot on our plate: 
- we do research on neglected risks, especially AI safety &amp; cybersecurity and host private workshops, e.g. on AI Policy with MIRI, EFF, OpenAI, Google Brain, Future of Life Institute, Future of Humanity Institute, and other Ai safety orgs
--&gt; Your donation would allow us to host additional meetings, which were requested by participants (requested topics: open vs close AI safety research, cybersecurity as catastrophic risk)
- We award the Feynman Prizes and the Foresight Fellowship to brilliant scientists to further their work in underfunded projects. Our 2007 Feynman Prize winner, Sir Fraser Stoddart won the shared Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016 for his work in molecular machines.
--&gt; Your donation would allow us to invite our prodigies to our gatherings so they can participate, present their work, and connect with mentors.
- We host invitational workshops to push for progress in specific scientific fields, e.g. longevity, AI, atomic precision. Previous workshop was described as "the most interesting conference I have attended in years” by John Koza, Pioneer of Genetic Programming. 
--&gt; Your donation would allow us to host two workshops next year, Nobel Prize Laureate Fraser Stoddart has agreed to chair the first workshop in May 2018 on Molecular Machines.
- we host salons free to the public and our Vision Weekend to get to work on topics of fundamental importance to our future. E.g. on "Blockchain: The Next Frontier" including Arthur Breitman, Tezos, Zooko Wilcox, ZCash, Jorge Lopez, ESCA, Mark Miller, Foresight Institute  "Long-term thinking: The Tools To Make It Beyond The Century" including Joon Yun, Palo Alto Investors, Tom Kalil, previous White House Office for Science &amp; Technology, Melanie Swan, Institute for Blockchain Studies, "Longevity: Reaching Escape Velocity" with Aubrey De Grey, SENS, Sonia Arrison, Thiel Foundation, Max More, Alcor Life Extension, Kevin Perrott, Buck Institute, and more than 10 further topics.
--&gt; Your donation would allow us to keep the always “sold-out’ salons free to the public and offer income-support for Vision Weekend.
- we collect a collaborative knowledge graph to steer humanity toward positive long-term futures at existentialhope.com
--&gt; Your donation would allow us to ask experts in different fields (e.g. asteroid mining) to populate sub-sections of the index and recruit brilliant people to work on more long-term projects
