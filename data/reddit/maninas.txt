Fuck em. Vote with your money. Take them to a competitor who offers a service better covering your needs.

Is this an altcoin technology or something that will be integrated into bitcoin core?

I remember and miss a time when this subreddit was all mature posts like this, technology and theoretical economics discussions.
I would trust in visiting every day and get credible and insider bitcoin news and insightful educated opinions.
Sadly, today it's all about the price, the memes and fearful circlejirks with the occasional gem post every 1-2 days and that's it.
If bitcoin fails it will be because its community failed it. Cherish it and keep it tidy and grounded.

As a Greek reading this, knowing all that bailout money was given to the banks and essentially is the people that pay for it in immense taxations and a fucked up market, I get quite mad...

I miss having quality discussions like this on this subreddit. Not fuckin memes, and HODL circlejirk, but solid argumentation and debate on economics and technology and their sociopolitical impact.
Thank you, OP.
