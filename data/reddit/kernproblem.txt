Price may be going down, but 100bits will be 100bits forever!

"assumevalid" assumes that all transactions up to a certain block are valid. By default, it’s block 453354 for Bitcoin Core 0.14.0.
It still verifies the proof of work for all blocks, and records the entire transaction history, it no longer checks signatures and similar data for each individual transaction.
You probalby want to prune the blockchain on your PC localy and then transfer it to your VPS. Keep in mind that the VPS still needs a significant amount of RAM to act as a full node.

I would start by making a copy of the blockchain, then enable pruning on your desktop node. Zip, encrypt, and transfer the *blocks* and *chainstate* folders to your VPS. Enable pruning on the  VPS. Then copy the unpruned blockchain back on your desktop machine.
4GB is more than enough.

It would be way faster if you download and validate the blockchain on your desktop, then enable pruning and copy it to your Pi. It's about to 2.6GB in size (blocks folder 600MB + ~2GB chainstate folder). You need you start both bitcoin clients with the same pruning parameter.

With lightning network its actually possible to exchange between BTC and LTC without any third party or trust.
It's known under the name *atomic swap* or *atomic cross-chain trading*.
I think it was first described [here]( There is also an wiki entry [here](

If you sweep the 5 BTC from your paper wallet and send it to an exchange with a fee of 0.0002 BTC your transaction has a total input of 5 BTC, however you have an output (the BTC that reaches the exchange) of 4.9998 BTC. The 0.0002 BTC fee goes to the miner. You then have an empty paper wallet with 0 BTC left. 
IIRC electrum sets a fee when sweeping private keys. There might be an option somewhere to change the standard fee for sweeping, but you are not able set a fee in the GUI.

The time is passing so quickly right now.

This is not a list of all nodes, it just shows the peers (the other nodes) you are connected to. 
Open port 8333 in your router and add your node on  to see it listed.

"If your miner is vulnerable it will cease mining within 11 minutes, or you can reboot your miner and the connection will be made on startup." as stated on antbleed.com. 
Your miner wouldn't even start to mine, unless you spoof the serial number and/or mac address. Which makes the anti-theft feature pretty useless tbh.

LN is not necessary for atomic cross swaps. Atomic cross swaps are working at the moment. But LN enables instantaneous swaps, which makes an efficient decentralized exchange considerably better.

This depends one the format of the leaked key.
If the private key is in hex like:
E9 87 3D 79 C6 D8 7D C0 FB 6A 57 78 63 33 89 F4 45 32 13 30 3D A6 1F 20 BD 67 FC 23 3A A3 32 62 
Leaking E9 87 and 32 62 would reduce the key strength by 64bit from 256bit to 196bit. This means an bruteforce attack on the public key would be way   faster (but still nearly unbreakable).
I'm not quite sure about the exact strength reduction for WIF, but only the second, third and forth character are from the private key. The last four are from a checksum. 
Best practice is to make sure the key is completely private. If anything gets leaked, move the coins.
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:12:57
A private key consists of 256 bit (32 byte or 64 HEX characters) of data. A SHA-256 hash consists of 256 bit (32 byte or 64 HEX characters) of data. 
So (nearly) every SHA-256 hash can be a private key. By hashing the original private key with one or multiple passwords/various combinations (essentially our own algorithm) you just create a new private key.
You now can store your original private key for example on our hard drive or even in a cloud (where it is "leaked"), but you don't store the password / the algorithm how you get the new private key. You just remember it. 
Your private key now can't be used to retrieve your coins without knowing your secret algorithm.

They can choose. They can use their own algorithm for choosing transactions. 
But since choosing the high fee transactions makes more money, they often go with these.

The earliest/optimistic date: 23. August
1. BIP91 is active on 21. July  
2. SegWit period 20 starts around 27. July  
3. SegWit locks in around 10. August  
4. SegWit is active around 23. August
