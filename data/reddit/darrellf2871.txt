wow, I find myself asking a better question why would anyone trade on QuadrigaCX? 0.5% fee on all trades.
so you buy a bitcoin for $19000 on GDAX... 
Then there is the bitcoin network transfer fee.
Then hope you get it there in a timely manner before the price changes on QuadrigaCx.
Then pay 0.5% of the sale for selling it on QuadrigaCX.
Then you have to figure out how you are going to get your USD out of Quadrida or wait for the price to lower and buy BTC again with a 0.5% fee, pay the transfer fee to get it back...
how much money have you really made if any for the effort, over waiting for the price to change on GDAX?

there is 800 for sale they are dumping now

well, don't forget they can also short bitcoin on the actual bitcoin market as well so an extension of that scenario. they accumulate a large sum of bitcoin. Turn on margin. borrow the same amount of bitcoin they have accumulated... sell it at 15k driving the market down and creating a panic sell, then sell their bitcoin driving it even further down to lets say hypothetically $1 because who knows how far they would actually make it.... buy back the bitcoin they borrows for the now $1 price and return them... they have now made all the money off selling their bitcoin, 15k times the amount of bitcoin they borrowed.... and whatever they shorted on the futures market.

Incorrect I use limit orders many times a day you use a limit order to buy at a future price yes on a buy limit but not a price greater than current price but any price less. A sell limit is the opposite current price or any price greater...
Market order is buying or selling on current bid or ask.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:24:38
The problem with your argument is the people making told you so posts have experienced these dips many times and advised those who sold not sell  
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:41:04
there is also a dif tax rate for long term captial gains (holding atleast 1 year before selling) and short term (selling less than a year).... short term is taxed as if normal income... long term is taxed at a much lower rate.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:59:48
actually more likely answer to get is we are not coinbase however they do have a sub reddit where your question may get answered more acurately
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:14:20
I'm not mad at coinbase. A bunch of people screaming about lawsuits because they got greedy and lost, does not necessarily represent the opinion of the majority.
I will however be somewhat concerned if the dumb ass employer that leaked the information and his cohort are not dealt with.

I don't know off hand which accept USD the list was taken from bitcoin org how to buy bitcoin page. I have no experience with the ATM's myself but have seen posts from people who have so I'm sure someone can give you more information on those. 
I pretty much exclusively buy through Coinbase / GDAX and have had no problems with them yet (that is not to say I won't in the future). Depending on requirement. Coinbase allows for credit card purchase at a fee of course, while GDAX (coinbase's exchange) you can link you bank account and transfer in and out for no fee and buy on the exchange. Bank transfer is slower though due to the US banking system it can take 7 to 8 days for the transfer to complete where Canadian and European bank transfers tend to only take about 2.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:12:43
I had this occur the other day and after a page refresh or 2 it finished.... GDAX seems to have some connectivity issues right now
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:27:35
click the price then your money.... if you do it the other way around or change the price after you have clicked to add the money the calculation will be wrong... I'm guessing you are try to chase the current bid price up, which is bad trading practice and will bite you in the ass more times than not
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:48:23
yeah considering in his previous post he claimed he bought at 8k

@_date: 2017-12-28 05:33:14
so which of the fake id's that you were trying to buy on all your other posts did you use to sign up to coinbase? I'm sure you want to remember that when you approach coinbase tell them they fucked you with all those NSF (Non Sufficient Funds) your bank charged you for not having enough funds in your bank account for the charges coming through.
While you are at you should look for a better bank as most banks have a limit on the amount of NSF fees they can charge you in one day...

1. the order book is what traders are offering to buy and sell it at.
2. the depth charts is showing a graphical view of the order book
3. setting up trades is on the left side. Market = buy or sell at the current bid or ask (.25% fee). Limit set a price that you will buy or sell at and how much (will go on the order book until someone takes it or you cancel, limit orders are 0 fee). Stops sets a price of when to put in your market sell or buy (I have not used stops so can not tell you much more on them)
4. you can transfer from coinbase wallet to GDAX for free. when you are trading you have wallets there for your usd and other currencies. you can also load through GDAX I believe the fees are cheaper but they have no credit card purchase option.
5. when you are on GDAX or Coinbase for that matter everyones money is in Gdax , coinbases wallets they just keep track of what belongs to whom. so there is no Bitcoin network transfer fees but if you sell at market rather than limit you will pay a 0.25% trade fee
and damn it I missed putting in my limit while explaining this to you
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:12:58
there is no limit on what you can sell... just how $ you can pull out daily....

Dear Bitcoin Community,
It is time for us to let Multibit go.
KeepKey acquired Multibit a little over 1 year ago. At the time, the engineers who originally built and supported Multibit had announced that they would no longer be working on it or providing support. Multibit played an important role in the Bitcoin infrastructure. We felt that it was important for Multibit to continue and hoped that with our existing support and development teams, we would be able to keep Multibit alive.
The reality is that Multibit is in need of a lot of work. It has stubborn bugs that have caused us and Multibit users much grief. Additionally, Bitcoin has gone through a fundamental change in regards to the way fees work. The addition of SegWit in the coming weeks will mean the Multibit software has fallen still further behind.
Unfortunately, KeepKey simply does not have the resources to support the current issues, nor to rebuild Multibit to ensure ideal user experience. By focusing our attention on the KeepKey device, we will continue building and improving the best hardware wallet available.
Thus, KeepKey will discontinue support and maintenance of Multibit, effective immediately.
We recommend that all Multibit users discontinue using it and you move your keys to other wallet software of your choosing. We wrote a blog post describes some options of your options in more detail.
Multibit was a fantastic piece of software in its time, and we want to thank the Multibit developers for such an important contribution to Bitcoin's history.
Ken Hodler
Chief Technical Officer

why would coinbase hold a pool of BTC.... they own an exchange and sell you the BTC at a premium above the exchange price... so you buy 2 BTC - they grab 2 btc at market price from their exchange and sell it to you....
The common misconception about exchanges is that your wallet is separate from everyone else on that exchange.

I unlike you it would seem was actually really Trading on the GDAX at the time of the problems as well as the whole thread of Traders posting on here experiencing the same problem.
The problem was with the API yes....but how do you expect the website gets the information to display to you? Through the API perhaps? because it would be inefficient and more prone to errors as well as bad practice to write 2 sets of code. The API outtage affect trading as a whole and since people couldn't trade prices as well.... I as well as other traders who posted here experienced over 20 minutes of buy and sell orders pending....

so lets start with - bitcoin transfer fee to transfer there... then .15% fee to sell on bithumb... then all you have south Korean dollars. so then there is the fee to get the south korean dollars out of bithumb and the fee to convert those dollars to USD.... so how much of that gain do you have after that?

'Although HashFlare may have started out as a decent company with good intentions, it seems as though their decisions and actions of late have sent them on a permanent downward spiral. While conducting some investigative research for this unbiased HashFlare.io review, the amount of negative reviews and feedback we came across from actual members was truly astounding. Let us begin by looking at the current most prominent complaint found online from HashFlare users.
You may recall reading earlier on in our review that one of HashFlare’s features was offering lifetime contracts, as stated on their “About Us” page under “company.” Did you notice any lifetime contracts in any of the above listed cloud options they offer? Well, there is reason for this discrepancy. Recently HashFlare took the decision to not only cease offering these, but also to terminate existing lifetime contracts and convert them over to the current offering of one year.
This decision has led to outrage among users. After having read pages of complaints from irate customers in various cryptocurrency forums regarding the sudden change, it seems as though this has led to HashFlare losing many existing users as well as potential new customers. Some users threatened legal action, while others simply stated that they had been scammed and were no longer happy with their changed contracts or with Hashflare in general. It may be interesting to note that at the time of shortening the contracts, they also doubled their price. That is very unethical of them.'

Hey, I'm an expert crypto trader!!! I can show you a couple days where I made 10% gains... 
Thing is thats what I have wrote down on my spreadsheet? Does it make it true? Do you know me? And more importantly if I was making those trades and that kind of money for myself why would I spend my time doing it for you as well when I could just do more for me? (which might just explain why I'm not giving trading advice here). 
Now my first thoughts after hearing this, and this is just my thoughts, I have no evidence and I could be completely wrong. However is sounds like some trying to gather access to a bunch of accouts to have more buying power to create a pump and dump... the end result being you getting banned from ever using that exchange again.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:40:56
Because on an exchange everything is in the exchanges wallet... they just keep track of who owns what so no transactions take place on the bitcoin network till you take your bitcoin.
Thats also why they tell you here if you are just hodling don't keep your coins on the exchange cause you don't own the wallet
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:59:12
your BCH if they came from a split would be 0 cost investment so sale of them would be all Capital Gains. as to the BTC if they were purchased 1 Year or more ago I would say they would be long term capital gains from the price you paid for them originally even though you tried unsucessfully to spend them.
I keep a spreadsheet for my own personal records but as to what you have to present with you taxes I would consult and accountant about the proper forms and evidence you need to present

the fee has to do with the size of the data being transmitted and how quickly you want it to process
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:06:22
uhmmm.... here's your tinfoil hat.
Coinbase / GDAX makes a shitton more money off traders trading in currency than they do off you buying your bitcoin or ether.... and that is not going away because of lightning network if anything it will increase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:14:01
the limit is how much you can take out or put in weekly.... not how much you can purchase once the currency is there... it would be impossible to trade if there was a limit on the purchases once it was there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:16:56
Lol you keep telling yourself that while not reading the exchanges terms of service... I'm sure you enjoy hanging out with those who have already had their accounts frozen
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:15:23
Yeah, tell your bank to stop taking some many holdays and upgrade their system. transfer for US banking system takes 7 to 8 banking Days.... Transfers for Canadian and European banking system takes about 2 banking days or so
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:06:27
yes, that is the problem. when you buy through coinbase you buy at the price they are charging when you buy.... with GDAX if I understand correctly how it works you have to wait until the money gets there and then try to buy at whatever price it is at... then if you don't put in a limit buy and hope they buy your limit up you are going to pay another .25% for making a market price trade
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:45:59
so if I understand what you are saying here... would be that you think you storing offline in your Trezor or Ledger is safer than Coinbase /GDAX storing offline? And that somehow hackers can magically hack in and steal something offline....
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:55:20
You are correct I should have been more clearer in my response. I was not saying a stop limit was not correct for this situation. I was saying that the explanation for limits did not sound correct
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:06
being a day trader I wouldn't typically buy the highs and sell the dips... that is no way to make money
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:04:53
You obviously don't understand how crypto currency exchanges work or how the price of crypto currency is decided for that matter. And clearly you have deluded yourself into thinking lightning network will be free and instant. And somehow think all those traders will stop trading bitcoin with each other and determining what the price of your bitcoin. You seem to also in your uninformed delusion think that the main purpose of an exchange is to move between cryptos... so when coinbase and Gemini go away who is going to determine the price of your crypto or the price of futures for that matter since they go off Gemini's trade price
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:22
my thoughts as well this has nothing to do with bitcoin

yeah and you tell all the experienced people here how stupid and uneducated they are while using word like Bruh? LMFAO
You keep telling yourself that, mean while you speaking and statements here tell a story of someone who has absolutley no idea how stock or even the price of the US dollar and other currency works and is decided. I'll just go back to watching the trades on GDAX and contemplating that if I wasn't so stupid and uneducated I probably would have had more than 62% gains on my investments that I made in less than a month.

uploading a fake id to prove you are not a minor, when in fact your are a minor is certainly illegal and 99% likely you are not getting any of your money back as violating the terms forfeits your account.
And it is not their Shitty TOS. It is laws put in place by: The Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that apply to all exchanges and banks. So keep that in mind when you are explaining to them how you broke the law. I'm sure your parents will be happy too when they are be scrutinized for allowing you to break the law

lets us a Hypothetical price here and coin: I have 10 coins and I want short... so I take 10 coins on a margin...
Sell those coins at 500 ( 10 x 500 = $5000 for me) hoping the price will drop (short) optimally the price drops to 450 I buy back those 10 coins ( 10 x 450 = $4500) and give then back to the margin provider and putting $500 in my pocket....
BUT if it goes the other way 550 i buy back the 10 coins to cut my losses (10 x 550 = 5500) and return the coins to the margin losing $500

okay... so let someone who actually read the question answer you even though you wording could be said to be attempting to dupe people into giving you the answer you want to here instead of the true answer and unfortunately 'my crypto friends told me I was doing it right is not an acceptable answer to the irs'
if you buy $200 worth of Crypto and only sell $180 worth keeping some crypto... Yes you have to figure out the capital gains on the portion you sold.
however if you truely mean that you bought $200 and when you sold ALL of it only got $180 then that is a captial loss that can be deducted from future capital gains.

though if you think the market price is volitile get ready to get your mind blown when you see the traders trading....
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:40:36
Because on an exchange everything is in the exchanges wallet... they just keep track of who owns what so no transactions take place on the bitcoin network till you take your bitcoin.
Thats also why they tell you here if you are just hodling don't keep your coins on the exchange cause you don't own the wallet

to my understanding and what other people have told me of their experience. When you make a bank purchase of bitcoin you buy it the current price coinbase is charging just have no access to it until the bank transfer clears
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:25:13
first off if you read coinbase terms... Coinbase functions the same way as a bank IE. when you buy from coinbase you buy at premium a certain amount of points above the current trading price on GDAX....
so as the others told you, you are going to get a better price transferring you money to GDAX and putting in a buy there. If you time it right you might even find GDAX trading below market price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:22:20
places like coinbase and GDAX hold everyones crypto in one big wallet and just keep track of who owns what so when making a transfer with in their system they are just changing the entry to who owns what in the walllet... coinbase owns GDAX so it is the same when transfering between coinbase and GDAX

Buy orders like that on the books is typically traders trying to stop the drop there with no intention of it ever getting bought.... and they could pull it if it starts to get bought.... more often than not if there is intention for a big buy or sell  you won't even see it on the book or it will come on at the last minute....
I mean if I intended to make a big buy would I put the money on the board at a set price creating an artificial bottom or wait and see how low I can get it at.........

'Although HashFlare may have started out as a decent company with good intentions, it seems as though their decisions and actions of late have sent them on a permanent downward spiral. While conducting some investigative research for this unbiased HashFlare.io review, the amount of negative reviews and feedback we came across from actual members was truly astounding. Let us begin by looking at the current most prominent complaint found online from HashFlare users.
You may recall reading earlier on in our review that one of HashFlare’s features was offering lifetime contracts, as stated on their “About Us” page under “company.” Did you notice any lifetime contracts in any of the above listed cloud options they offer? Well, there is reason for this discrepancy. Recently HashFlare took the decision to not only cease offering these, but also to terminate existing lifetime contracts and convert them over to the current offering of one year.
This decision has led to outrage among users. After having read pages of complaints from irate customers in various cryptocurrency forums regarding the sudden change, it seems as though this has led to HashFlare losing many existing users as well as potential new customers. Some users threatened legal action, while others simply stated that they had been scammed and were no longer happy with their changed contracts or with Hashflare in general. It may be interesting to note that at the time of shortening the contracts, they also doubled their price. That is very unethical of them.'

well the price on GDAX is what it is trading for on GDAX sometime GDAX trades above market sometimes it trades below. but if you are day trading you should only really be concerned about the prices on your exchange of choice unless you are trying to do arbitrage which is somewhat difficult to do in the current environment 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:09
why would you go with Bittrex over GDAX coinbases own exchange which you can transfer to from your coinbase wallet for free.... and won't eat all your money up in trading fees....
Bittrex 0.25% in on any type of trade, 0.25% out on any type of trade.
GDAX - maker (buy or sell order on limit) 0% fee, Taker (Takes the buy or sell limit that is already on the books) 0.25% or less depending on volume.

oh look there is 1000 sell wall on ETH a minute ago.... must be the russians...
oh and that 8000 buy wall at 5 AM that must of been the russians too... or was it the CIA fighting back?
its commonly used in trading for various reasons.... slow trading to get all bought in before it goes up, intimidate buys or sells, slow selling to get sold out at a high price, etc, etc, etc
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:36:13

@_date: 2017-12-05 04:13:46
I think your calculations are wrong.
by the specs... a 1070 GPU can do 30 MH/S so 8 would give you 240 MH/s lets just say those 8 graphics cards and the machine powering them is only drawing 1293 w and you only happen to be paying 12 cents per kilowatt hour.... my calculator say you are loosing $3.72 cents a day at bitcoin price of 11605.94 
Now lets take the antminer S9 13 TH and its 1300 watt consumption... and the numbers change to 24.42 and $732.63 a month.
There is a big difference between between Mega hash and Terra Hash. I took the specs for the 1070 hash ability from one of those tech articles trying to convince people they can still mine bitcoin with GPU's

when you goto the bank and ask to sell some foreign currency for USD, do you get market price for it? or when you want to buy foreign currency? not typically... typically you pay a premium for that exchange just like you do on coinbase.

I run a full node and average around 25 to 30 connections... most times I forget it is even running cause I don't notice a difference in my network speed or computer function, it is not a real drain on resources and helps support the network

you bought at market price instead of limit buy... making you a taker not a maker... Taker gets .25% fee, maker gets 0% fee... look at your fill order on the buy you were charged a fee.... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:18:21
I use GDAX... 0.25% Taker fee or less depending on your volume of trading and 0% maker fees (limit buys or sells ). As long as you are making limit trades you are trading for free. 
as an added bonus 0 fee bank transfers

have you ever noticed when you goto you bank and buy a foreign currency you always pay above the market price... and when you goto your bank and exchange a foreign currency you always get below market price?

you don't have a private wallet in an exchange. The exchange has one big wallet and just keeps track of who owns what.
if you are just holding bitcoin for a long period of time as an investment or have no reason to keep it on an exchange you should get your own wallet and store it there, preferably a hardware wallet or offline wallet for security

except when you want nobody in control... then there is no one to make it Illegal

market order is going to get fees all the time... if you are doing a higher volume it is less of a fee but there is always a fee on market by definition market order you are the taker....
I do limit orders all the time on there

'Nick Name
This name will be part of your public profile.'
'Legal Name'
two different slots on you profile on coinbase. Legal name is greyed out and  locked so you cannot change it... Nickname is editable.
however we are not coinbase support so nothing we can really do to help with this.

I wonder how long before you find yourself sued or in jail especially broadcasting publicly on reddit that your are doing it

GDAX if you trade on limits no fees... but they are experiencing issues today on their verification system
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:30:59
woo woo 8K I'll buy more in.
BTW just an FYI when all your posts are attempts to get people to panic sell.... Especially unrealistic ones like you just sold 500 BTC. People tend to see right through you

don't invest more than You can afford to loose...
Me on the other side of the coin, I have not invested more than I can afford to loose and in a little less than a month have made 62% gain on what I invested.

Pretty much what chocolatesouffle3 said... watch GDAX or other exchanges for a while someone will come in with a bunch of sells push it down a bunch with help of panic sellers jumping ship because the price is dropping fast and allows them to buy back in a lower and ride the price back up to where it was... watched it on sunday....
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:33:25
GDAX is coinbase... I would recommend trading on GDAX over Bittrex... Bittrex will kill you on fees .25% each way... GDAX only charges .25% or less to taker depending on takers volume and 0% on maker...  so if you use limit buys and sells you are trading for free.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:22:09
coinbase never charges market price, just like when you but into a foreign currency you usually pay more than the current price...

I got my first post here auto modded took a message to a mod and a few minutes or so for a mod to see it and it was reinstated and it was probably even my fault too for assuming I knew the rules and not reading them completely. I would rather that then not being able to find anything due to spam or getting false information from a shil that didn't get auto modded

We all know here that cloud mining is not good that is why most cloud mining sites have big disclaimers on them that say 'Cloud mining is only for for fun and you should never expect to make a profit off of doing it................'

They will know you have it as a California Judge just recently granted the IRS permission to look at coinbase's records to see who in the US bought bitcoin and is not reporting gains or losses
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:58:20
the prices on the exchanges are what it is currently trading at not the current market price. At time it can be trading higher or lower than the market price, depends on the traders

By my count there sure are a lot of British pounds out there... Canada split off from England and put theirs out there. The US split from England and put theirs out there. Austrailia.... ... ... Their all just children of the British Pound this could become problem one day might come back to bite the Pound some day, hell the US british pound is already kicking it around.....
Think I could write for Bloomberg?

probably slim. Though the $2 million wall on GDAX seems to have disappeared for the time being

no, all those traders will not suddenly stop trading bitcoin back and forth at 10k. They are using them right now just means the people waiting to make a quick buck on there investment at 10k are running low

From what I read in the news they are using block chain technology to speed up international transactions between them and two other banks

also the nature of limit orders someone has to be on the other who is not the limit... so they alway collect fees on one side of the trade. Their fee actually says makers don't get charged, takers do... If you put a limit out there that is not filled immediately when it is placed you are the Maker (no charge) the person who fills that order once it is out is the Taker (.25% charge ) however if you trade high volumes in the past 30 days the fee could go lower.

The limit is 21 million and miners collect transaction fees for the transactions in the block they mine
