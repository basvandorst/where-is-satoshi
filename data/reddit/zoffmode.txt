That said, "Outernet" doesn't look useful enough as a service to me compared to the cost it'd take to run it. It'd be hard to convince public to support it. However, that doesn't mean that these services can't function.

One could argue that effort of scamming by chargeback multiplied by number of people doing it is greater that setting up an okay looking business and scamming same number of people.
Furthermore, a company will be able to see these scams arising and then can take action to counter them. On other hand, customers can only combat being scammed through customer protection and media/awareness (but when awareness kicks in, that means it's already too late and a lot of money has been scammed away).

Great idea. No way a criticism of bitcoin, but why not also put in other crypto currencies (1 dollar each) ? You can even write which ones you like and don't like, and what you'll think will happen to them in 4 years.
