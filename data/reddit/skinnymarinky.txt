This "University" is a joke. It's just another way a VC can try and find new  entrepreneurs to steal their ideas and hard work. This guy just wants to get in on the ground floor and then when you realize you don't have what it takes to run the company he will replace you with his CEO. 
The courses such as kickball and camping "teach" people to become better entrepreneurs. They condition you to blindly follow bad ideas and don't actually give you tools to fix them. The $12,000 fee to learn these great skills is a testimonial to how great the program must be. $40K for a semester at Harvard Business School or $12k for 6 weeks at Draper U.
Try and find a good review that wasn't a PR release or from one of the three people who received start-up funding from Draper. 
Don't waste your bitcoins on this.

You are correct, execution is the hardest part. Most VC's won't look at a company until they already have a significant user base or revenue already coming in, DU is no different. They only accept students who already have a business and are looking to expand and grow. 
They enroll you in the course and if your business is a viable one will continue to fund the growth. If it is not viable then you are left owing them money and putting your entire life on hold for their classes. Only 2-3 people have actually been funded by the program out of the over 100 former students and who knows how many applicants they rejected.
Most VC's will approve you for a class (Techstars, Y Combinator) and will actually help you. If you don't get funding after your accelerator you are not indebted to them. They also don't do it as a guise to help the little man when in fact they are just profiting. Don't believe check and see if they are a 501 (c)(3).
