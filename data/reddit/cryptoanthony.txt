CPFP/RBF does change that because they now allow wallet users to double-spend, instead of only miners. Therefore increasing risk. Yes, they can accept the increased risk, and that's cool. I would just like everyone to know that there is increased risk.
This can be mitigated by having wallet software or payment processors check transactions and highlight them as "all clear" to accept a 0conf. They can check the transaction is opted-out of RBF and has an adequate fee attached.
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:33:11
Does CPFP and RBF affect the idea of "coffee shops can accept 0conf transactions"?  
  
My thinking is that making unconfirmed transactions more easily spendable in turn makes 0conf transactions less trustworthy... Say a coffee shop accepts 0conf transactions for orders under $10, the sender can re-broadcast that UTXO to another address under his control with a higher fee after receiving his coffee.

I've placed a few orders with many items. A couple orders had as much as 6 tracking numbers. I let the buyer know as soon as I received each one and everything went great. Just gotta stay on top of things and keep communication open.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:42:10
I'm sorry you had this experience.  
  
My first order from Purse.io was a $1600 order for a Phantom 4 drone. I know it was pretty risky of me to spend that much on a first order, but I wanted it enough. That completed with no problems. I proceeded to make 4-5 more $1000+ orders in the next month and they went well. I think I asked for 12-13% discounts and they were accepted within 12 hours.  
  
The only problem that I had is that one guy threatened me and accused me of being a scammer (like 8 nasty messages in a row) because I didn't acknowledge the package was delivered within an hour of it being delivered. The package was left on my porch while I wasn't home. I got home 4 hours after the package was delivered, completed the order by saying it was delivered, and was done with that dude.
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:28:02
Cool. Thanks for the clarification. I remember years ago people were supporting the idea that 0conf transactions were okay for small purchases. CPFP and RBF make that idea even less okay... As long as everyone knows 0confs are not okay, then I'm happy.

I still don't get it. Why can't a government coerce mining pools? That seems the most covert operation for attacking any chain, as no hash rate increase would be detected.

This is where I originally heard about this.
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:36:08
Are you arguing my point? I fail to see what your argument is exactly. A government wouldn't need a pool to have 51% before taking it over. It can coerce multiple smaller pools and combine them into the hash rate it needs. And, as you said, depending on luck, they don't need as high as 51%.
Anyway, the argument should be "what makes Bitcoin more secure than Vitalik or Vlad's proposed PoS ideas?" Since that's what this topic is specifically about.

I can see how AML and private transactions could slow down our payment ecosystem. Say that someone buys an IoT device without a physical input interface. They'd have to remote in, and fill out their AML info... instead of the payment network working from the start. But that's the price you pay to make sure the smoke alarm isn't laundering money for a drug cartel.
I say, if someone wants to make private transactions on our public blockchain, then charge them a higher fee. Slow down their confirmations if they don't pay it. They're the ones that are slowing us down by being the reason we have AML laws in the first place.

Being rich isn't all it's cracked up to be. It destroys your relationships with your family and friends. Either you try to keep it a secret from them (which they find out eventually from your purchases), or you tell them and they start treating you differently. Not only by some of them feeling entitled to your money, but others saying how you don't deserve the money, you didn't earn it, and don't everything else to make you feel like shit.  
  
On top of that, if you're single, it makes it even harder to find a girlfriend. Everyone in your life before your fortune is of the same worth as before your fortune. You probably live in a cheap location with lack of girls with access to similiar wealth and you don't wanna marry scum. On top of that, it's hard to justify spending money on nice things because you don't wanna attract a girl who is attracted to money. If she sees your fancy car and nice suits and smiles at you, it's an instance turn off. You automatically know it's because of how you look and dress, which you can never live up to those expectations she now has. Once you realize this, you start taking care of yourself even less. Get haircuts less, shave less often. If you don't want a girl to be attracted to your looks and money, you become the opposite of that.
Also, once other people know you're wealthy, they start charging you more. Especially your accountant. Who you didn't need when you were poor, but now desperately need so you don't go to jail for not paying taxes or lose all your money doing something stupid. And it's not like you can negotiate with him and say "Oh, that's expensive. I can't afford to pay you $5000 to do my taxes" because he knows what you can afford and can't.
Overall, mo money mo problems.

First, the problem with Nintendo wasn't "solved" with bitcoin. It was worked around with it. Nintendo will still do this, and if many people start circumventing it with crypto-currency, then somehow, someone will find a way to stop it.
Second, it sounds like finding a stranger and trusting him to send money to your friend is a lot of hassle. How did you find the stranger? How long did it take to find the right one? Did you watch him deposit the money into your friend's account? The problem would be solved if the ticket holder accepting crypto-currencies.
My point being that the problem wasn't solve, but circumvented. Congrats, none-the-less.

Say you bring an ASIC from 2015 back in time to 2009 and make a ton of money. How would you know which currency to bring with you back to 2015? Your actions affected the economy and could've cause that currency or any currency to fail by when you return to 2015. Your actions could've made the blockchain tech fail and even no altcoins would be considered anymore. I wouldn't recommend investing in bitcoin for time-travelers, due to this unique volatility. You should diversify your bitcoins into many different things before returning to 2015. Then again, maybe the currency that wins in 2015 isn't existing in 2009 for you to invest in... Time travelling seems more risky and volatile than real life.

I'm unsure if you're a btc buyer or seller, but wouldn't you need to file for capital gains tax or something for each trade from LBC? My understanding is that a taxable event occurs when btc is exchanged for USD, goods, services, etc.  
  
I'm asking because I thought about selling on LBC throughout the years. If I were to start selling on LBC, I'd need to tell the IRS the price I bought btc for and the price I sold it for.  
  
I'd also need a way to replenish my btc supply cheaply and quickly, which for me means using Coinbase, which means paperwork and paper trail. And since I have bitcoins that I bought on Coinbase a long time ago, FIFO is gonna put them in my tax report... unless I open a 2nd Coinbase account specifically for LBC sales.

I'm not sure I believe in that quote anymore.  
  
I used to discuss ideas, problems, and solutions day in and day out (mostly with myself, sometimes online)... everyone involved in btc years ago did. Nowadays, I don't discuss anything. I just do it.  
  
It's good to have a simulated disaster machine (peanut gallery) to look for worst case scenarios, but I can't participate in that. I end up broke, wrapped up in my own thoughts, focusing on finding failure points and solutions, and never really accomplishing anything for myself.  
  
Maybe I just don't know the business model/career path of a researcher/engineer/designer/etc and was therefore stuck as a person discussing ideas on the internet.  
  
So, if not discussing ideas anymore makes me less than average, then so be it. At this point in my life, I need to take action.

For me, it's because I'm accidentally locked out of my account on and off for 3-4 months now. Coinbase is able to get me back in, but it takes weeks for them to respond to me.
I've had my account for 3-4 years now. I made it to test out if I could integrate it with point-of-sale devices I was building. A few years later, I purchased 1 or 2 btc. My account is verified as high as it can be, and I've never done anything remotely illegal.
Recently I wanted to sell some btc, so I logged into Coinbase... only to receive a prompt saying that I must authorize my computer as a new device. I thought "okay, makes sense. I upgraded to Win10 and upgraded hardware recently"... So I waited for the email from them. 10 minutes passed and I didn't receive it. So I start looking through my junk mail... it's not there. I open a support ticket, 3 days goes by and I hear nothing. Eventually I get onto the Coinbase subreddit and post about my issue there. 24hrs later, I get a response... however, I can't verify that the person who responded to me is actually a Coinbase representative. I bring this up and it takes him another 24hrs to provide proof that he works for Coinbase.
So, we talk for a while, a couple days go by due to delays in his responses, and we find out that my email address is black listed. So he submits a request to have it white listed. That fixes the issue and I am not receiving emails from Coinbase again.
Fast forward a week... I install Coinbase on my phone. I need to get a new device authorization. However, I am not receiving emails again. I msg the Coinbase rep on reddit and we get my email address whiltelisted in a couple days.
This happened a few more times. And now, all my devices need new device authorization again. Even the ones that I successfully registered recently. It's been over 3 weeks since I opened a ticket and haven't heard anything. No response to the two posts I made in either.
I've been wanting to create a Coinbase btc address to accept donations to my business, since I heard they keep track of the stuff needed for when I file taxes. I've since ditched that idea because I can't reliably access my account.

I don't mind telling people, if they ask, because it quickly weeds out who I can trust and who I can't. Shows peoples true colors and intentions. Downside to that is you have to up your defenses, stand up for yourself, and always be aware. Which can take a lot of time and mental energy. So when I have too much of people, I end up retreating back to being by myself. People stealing from me isn't really an issue, as I have quite good security. Kidnapping me and holding me at gunpoint to give you crypto won't work. But, having something go wrong in your life, me feeling bad and trying to help you out, then feeling threatened you'll end our friendship unless I help you out more, usually gets me.

Hmm. I know back when bitcoin price was rapidly increasing, they hired on a ton of customer support people to help deal with the influx of customer problems. During all the bitcoin hype, they were struggling to train all the new hires quickly enough... I always thought they hired too many and would have to fire some as trade volume and hype died. Maybe that is what happened and support sucks again, so they need to re-hire more people. That or trade volume is increasing again because more people are selling? Doubt that's the case though for a few reasons.

Also, I can't directly relate quitting to this, but I spend $140/wk on a therapist now.

Everyone doing bandwidth speeds to predict time to download the blockchain in the future are only seeing a little bit of the picture. You also have to realize the user's home hardware plays a larger role in internet speeds. At my home, I get 125/15 through Comcast on all of my computers. Though many users in my city never see those speeds because their NICs, routers, cables, drives are still old and their configurations aren't optimized. I know few people who use ethernet over wifi and zero people who have SSDs. If we want a more accurate projection, we're gonna need hardware adoption rate data too.

I feel this is the same as 100 pennies being worth less than 1 dollar, because no one wants the hassle of having 100 pennies.

It was a puzzle with a claimable prize. It's a fun way for me to give away bitcoins to co-workers that don't know much about it.

AND! If you look at the OP in that screenshot's post history, you can see he is now in school for blockchain development.

I don't think it's multisig in the sense that we know. What he is trying to say is that BitNotes has their own signature (completely unrelated to Bitcoin) that allows anyone to verify with Bitnotes that the note is legitimate. However, this centralizes trust to BitNotes. If used like cash, they become the Federal Reserve.

Are these 'bids automatic? Is it possible for two transactions, from two different addresses, constantly outbid each other until an address is drained of all of it's bitcoins?

I've been experiencing the same issue for a year, when I try to build a node using bitcoind or bitcoin-qt in Ubuntu. I've been fairly certain it's a RAM issue with me too, as I have the RAM OC'd to 2133Mhz. However, the RAM and all my other hardware pass every other test I've thrown at it. I'm planning on running a pruning node and seeing if that works, before lowering my RAM speeds.

Is the guarantee based only on your word? I don't see how you or anyone else can't create more of these notes showing the same public key. If these are shared around like dollars, all a user needs to do to verify trust is see the hologram isn't scratched off and the public key shows bitcoins linked to it on a third party blockchain viewer. There really doesn't need to even be a private key under that hologram.  
  
Maybe you have your own trust model on the note to verify BitNotes actually issued the note, which stops others from counterfeiting them, but it doesn't stop BitNotes from counterfeiting their own notes. This idea reintroduces a fully backed paper currency, but one that is backed by a centralized company.  
  
Please explain if I am wrong.

This was sarcasm, btw.

This is likely a scam. BTC address was created ~8hrs ago, post was submitted 9hrs ago. Unlikely hobo made sign within minutes of this being posted.

I totally agree, though your reason isn't one I had considered.  
  
Last Friday, I decided I wanted to buy a drone with some of my bitcoins. Now that the market is moving so much that I decided to wait until Tuesday or the price hits $480. If it hits $480 before Tuesday, I think it's gonna drop much lower than that.  
  
$480 is an arbitrary number I came up with, but it allows me to buy the drone while Bitcoin is worth more than I originally was gonna spend at.

You can link your bank account to Coinbase and do automatic purchases with your credit/debit card profits. I ended up doing similar when my job wouldn't allow me to use bitwage.

A couple months ago I went to login to Cryptsy to exchange LTC for ETH. I hadn't used Cryptsy in over a year because I had no need. Upon login, Cryptsy told me that my account was deactivated due to 6 months of inactivity and to contact support. Support wanted me to answer my two secret questions to verify my identity. So I opened my password document and replied with the answers I had written in it. Cryptsy support said the answers were incorrect and to try again. I'm positive I answered correctly but, in case I wrote them down wrong, I swapped the two answers.  q1:a2, q2:a1 Again, they told me they were incorrect. I had 2FA enabled and asked if I could verify my identity that way... they said "No" and that I would need to provide a bunch of personal info to re-activate my account. I gave up for a while... A month later, I made a new account with the intention of trading, and I didn't need any personal information to create the account. So, I deposited 1ltc and then withdrew that LTC to test before I deposited more. I didn't need to input personal info for that, but it took almost a full day to see that LTC back in my wallet. So I gave up for good.

This sounds better as a DAO. Have it crowd funded as a DAO. Each time a person pays to charge their phone, the money gets divided. A portion sent into the DAO to be distributed among investors, a portion held in the DOA contract that pays the electric company monthly, and a portion left in the DOA for contracting devs to make and install more charging devices. Bitcoin or Ethereum, doesn't matter to me.

This may be a solution is bloated blockchains, but doesn't it allow for inflation? What's stopping the creation of multiple paper notes referencing the same public key?

How possible would it be to divide bitcoins even more and make a nanobit be the smallest bitcoin unit? Then we can have a centibit 0.01, a millibit 0.001, a microbit 0.000001, a satoshi 0.00000001, and a nanobit 0.000000001

If transactions (not blocks) are decrypted only if the send/receiver decides to release a key, I would be worry about not being able to accurately audit addresses and trace transactions anymore. Say what you will about public vs private chains, but there is no doubt that being able to trace transactions through Bitcoin's public blockchain has helped a significant number of people throughout it's history.

Try coincap.io instead. It's made by the same people behind Shapeshift and Prism.
